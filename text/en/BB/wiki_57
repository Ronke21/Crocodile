<text>Thermopylae was an extreme composite clipper ship built in 1868 by Walter Hood &amp; Co of Aberdeen, to the design of Bernard Waymouth of London. Designed for the China tea trade, she set a speed record on her maiden voyage to Melbourne of 63 days, still the fastest trip under sail.

==Construction==

&quot;Thermopylae&quot; was built for the Aberdeen Line, which was founded in 1825 by George Thompson. She measured 212&#x27; × 36&#x27; × 20.9&#x27;, with tonnage 991 GRT, 948 NRT and 927 tons under deck. The hull planking was American rock elm from the garboard to the light water line, and then teak from there to the rail. Being of composite construction, the planking was fastened over an iron frame. 
She had exceptionally fine lines. The coefficient of under deck tonnage was 0.58. This compares with, for instance, Cutty Sark at 0.55 (i.e. slightly sharper than &quot;Thermopylae&quot;) and Ariel at 0.60. Iron was used for the fore and main lower masts and, when built, the yards for these masts.

==Performance ==
&quot;Thermopylae&quot; was designed for the China tea trade. Her outbound passage was usually to Australia. On her maiden voyage, starting November 1868, she set a speed record of 63 days from Gravesend to Hobsons Bay, Melbourne, or 60 days measured from the Lizard. On the return trip, leaving Fuzhou on 3 July 1869, she was 89 days to the Lizard, or 91 to London. Her first 10 outward passages to Melbourne averaged 69 days (starting from the Lizard) and her eleven homeward voyages with a cargo of tea averaged 106 and a half days.

&quot;Thermopylae&quot; was particularly suited to the tea trade, putting in excellent performances in light winds. Although fast on all point of sailing, she was especially quick sailing to windward. Both of these characteristics were important for getting across the China Sea, and it was this section of the homeward passage which was crucial for achieving a fast time back to London.

==Race with &quot;Cutty Sark&quot;==

In 1872, &quot;Thermopylae&quot; raced the 1869 clipper &quot;Cutty Sark&quot; from Shanghai back to London, taking 115 days and winning by seven days after &quot;Cutty Sark&quot; lost her rudder. Her record day&#x27;s run was 380 statute miles, a feat exceeded by no sailing ship before.

From 1879, with steam displacing sail from the China tea trade, she sailed to Sydney as her Australian terminal and entered the Australian wool trade homewards, with just one final tea run in 1881. From 1882 onwards, &quot;Thermopylae&quot; only took part in the Australian wool trade; on this route &quot;Cutty Sark&quot; proved faster however, as &quot;Thermopylae&quot; no longer had the advantage of her light wind performance.

After her last tea passage, she carried wool home from Sydney until in 1890 she was sold to Canadian owners and used in the timber trade. At this stage her rig was reduced to barque, with some further reductions in the height of her fore and main masts; she had already seen the height of some of her masts reduced during her time in the wool trade. In 1892 she served on routes across the Pacific Ocean from Canada, before arriving in Leith for the last time on 17 December 1895 where she was sold to the Portuguese government.

== Portuguese naval ship==
Renamed &quot;Pedro Nunes&quot; for intended use as a naval training ship, she arrived at the Tagus River in Portugal on 29 May 1896, and was commissioned into the Portuguese Navy on 20 August. The conversion to a training ship did not occur however, and she was soon reduced to a coal hulk. On 13 October 1907, she was towed out to the mouth of the Tagus at a Portuguese Navy League regatta attended by the Queen of Portugal, and sunk by Whitehead torpedoes.

<text>The Game of the Century is a chess game that was won by the 13-year-old future world champion Bobby Fischer against Donald Byrne in the Rosenwald Memorial Tournament at the Marshall Chess Club in New York City on October 17, 1956. In &quot;Chess Review&quot;, Hans Kmoch dubbed it &quot;The Game of the Century&quot; and wrote: &quot;The following game, a stunning masterpiece of play performed by a boy of 13 against a formidable opponent, matches the finest on record in the history of chess prodigies.&quot;

==Background==
Donald Byrne (1930–1976) was one of the leading American chess masters at the time of this game. He won the 1953 U.S. Open Championship, and represented the United States in the 1962, 1964, and 1968 Chess Olympiads. He became an International Master in 1962, and probably would have risen further if not for ill health. Bobby Fischer (1943–2008) was at this time a promising junior facing one of his first real tests against master-level opposition. His overall performance in the tournament was mediocre, but he soon had a meteoric rise, winning the 1957 U.S. Open on tiebreaks, winning the 1957–58 U.S. (Closed) Championship (and all seven later championships in which he played), qualifying for the Candidates Tournament and becoming in 1958 the world&#x27;s youngest Grandmaster at age 15. He won the world championship in 1972, and is considered one of the greatest chess players of all time.

In this game, Fischer (playing Black) demonstrates noteworthy innovation and improvisation. Byrne (playing White), after a standard opening, makes a seemingly minor mistake on move 11, losing a tempo by moving the same piece twice. Fischer pounces with brilliant sacrificial play, culminating in a queen sacrifice on move 17. Byrne captures the queen, but Fischer gets copious material for it – a rook, two bishops, and a pawn. At the end, Fischer&#x27;s pieces coordinate to , while Byrne&#x27;s queen sits useless on the other side of the board.

==The game==

White: Donald Byrne Black: Bobby Fischer Opening: Grünfeld Defence (&quot;ECO&quot; D92)

1. Nf3
:A noncommittal move by Byrne. From here, the game can develop into a number of different openings.

1... Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7
:Fischer defends based on &quot;hypermodern&quot; principles, inviting Byrne to establish a classical pawn stronghold in the , which Fischer intends to target and undermine with his fianchettoed bishop and other pieces.

4. d4 0-0
:Fischer castles, bringing his king to safety. The Black move 4...d5 would have reached the Grünfeld Defence immediately. After Fischer&#x27;s 4...0-0, Byrne could have played 5.e4, whereupon 5...d6 6.Be2 e5 reaches the main line of the King&#x27;s Indian Defense.
5. Bf4 d5 (diagram) 
:The game has now transposed to the Grünfeld Defence (5...d5, &quot;ECO&quot; code D92), in a line with Bf4. The Grünfeld is usually initiated by 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 d5.

6. Qb3
:A form of the so-called Russian System (the usual move order is 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 d5 4.Nf3 Bg7 5.Qb3), putting pressure on Fischer&#x27;s central d5-pawn. Garry Kasparov points out that 6.Rc1 or 6.e3 both have extensive theory behind them, and that 6.cxd5 Nxd5 7.Nxd5 Qxd5 8.Bxc7 favors Black.

6... dxc4
:Fischer relinquishes his center, but draws Byrne&#x27;s queen to a square where it is exposed and can be attacked.

7. Qxc4 c6 8. e4 Nbd7
:In later games, Black played the more active 8...b5 followed by 9...Qa5. An example is Bisguier–Benko, U.S. Championship 1963–64. Fischer&#x27;s choice is a little slow, although one would not guess that from the subsequent play. Another possible move for Black is 8...Qa5, Boleslavsky&#x27;s move.

9. Rd1 Nb6 10. Qc5
:An awkward square for the queen, which leaves it exposed to a possible ...Na4 or ...Ne4, as Fischer brilliantly demonstrates. Since both those squares are protected by Byrne&#x27;s knight on c3, he understandably did not appreciate the danger. 10.Qd3 would have left the queen better placed. 

10... Bg4
:Byrne&#x27;s pawns control the center squares, but Fischer is ahead in and has castled, while Byrne&#x27;s king is still in the center. These factors would not have been very significant had Byrne attended to his development on his next move.
11. Bg5 (diagram)
:Intended to prevent 11...Nfd7 followed by ...e5, but Byrne errs by not completing his development. Numerous authors suggest 11.Be2 instead, protecting the king and preparing castling. Flear–Morris, Dublin 1991, continued 11.Be2 Nfd7 12.Qa3 Bxf3 13.Bxf3 e5 14.dxe5 Qe8 15.Be2 Nxe5 16.0-0 and White was slightly better.

11... Na4
:When this move was made, a number of people went over to the table to start watching the game. 

:&quot;One of the most powerful moves of all time.&quot; (Jonathan Rowson). Fischer offers an ingenious knight sacrifice. If Byrne plays 12.Nxa4, Fischer will reply 12...Nxe4, leaving Byrne with some terrible choices:
:*13.Qxe7 Qa5+ 14.b4 Qxa4 15.Qxe4 Rfe8 16.Be7 Bxf3 17.gxf3 Bf8 produces a deadly pin;
:*13.Bxe7 Nxc5 14.Bxd8 Nxa4 15.Bg5 Bxf3 16.gxf3 Nxb2 gives Fischer an extra pawn and ruins Byrne&#x27;s pawn structure;
:*13.Qc1 Qa5+ 14.Nc3 Bxf3 15.gxf3 Nxg5 regains the sacrificed piece with a better position and extra pawn;
:*13.Qb4 Nxg5 14.Nxg5 Bxd1 15.Kxd1 Bxd4 16.Qd2 Bxf2 with a winning advantage.

12. Qa3 Nxc3 13. bxc3 Nxe4
:Fischer again offers material in order to open the e-file and get at White&#x27;s uncastled king.

14. Bxe7 Qb6 15. Bc4
:Byrne wisely declines the offered material. If 15.Bxf8 Bxf8 16.Qb3, we have 16...Nxc3! 17.Qxb6 (17.Qxc3 Bb4 wins the queen) axb6 18.Ra1 Bxf3 (Fischer&#x27;s 1959 analysis gives instead 18...Re8+ 19.Kd2 Ne4+ 20.Kc2 Nxf2 21.Rg1 Bf5+ and winning) 19.gxf3 Ba3 20.Kd2 Bb2 21.Re1 Nd5 and Black is winning. 

15... Nxc3! 
:If 16.Qxc3, then 16...Rfe8 17.Qe3 Bxf3! (and 17...Qc7 because of 18.Bxf7+!) 18.gxf3 Qc7; if 16.Bxf8, then 16...Bxf8 17.Qxc3 Bb4.

16. Bc5 Rfe8+ 17. Kf1 (see diagram)
:Byrne threatens Fischer&#x27;s queen; Fischer brings his rook into play, displacing Byrne&#x27;s king. It appears that Fischer must solve his problems with his queen, whereupon White can play 18.Qxc3, with a winning material advantage. Jack Straley Battell writes that the masters observing the game considered Black&#x27;s position lost.

17... Be6!!
:This is the move that made this game famous. Instead of saving his queen, Fischer offers to sacrifice it. Fischer pointed out that 17...Nb5? loses to 18.Bxf7+ Kxf7 19.Qb3+ Be6 20.Ng5+ Kg8 21.Nxe6 Nxd4 22.Nxd4+ Qxb3 23.Nxb3.
18. Bxb6? (diagram)
:Byrne takes the offered queen, hoping to outplay his 13-year-old opponent in the ensuing complications, but Fischer gets far too much for it, leaving Byrne with a hopeless game. 18.Bxe6? would have been even worse, leading to a smothered mate with 18...Qb5+ 19.Kg1 Ne2+ 20.Kf1 Ng3+ 21.Kg1 Qf1+! 22.Rxf1 Ne2. 18.Qxc3 would have been met by 18...Qxc5! and if 19.dxc5, 19...Bxc3 and Black should win the endgame. White&#x27;s best chance may have been 18.Bd3 Nb5!, which Kmoch wrote would also result in &quot;a win for Black in the long run&quot;.

18... Bxc4+
:Fischer now begins a &#x27;windmill&#x27; series of , picking up material.

19. Kg1 Ne2+ 20. Kf1 Nxd4+ 21. Kg1 
:21.Rd3? axb6 22.Qc3 Nxf3 23.Qxc4 Re1#

21... Ne2+ 22. Kf1 Nc3+ 23. Kg1 axb6
:Fischer captures a piece, simultaneously revealing a discovered attack against Byrne&#x27;s queen.

24. Qb4 Ra4!
:Fischer was now sitting very calmly and making moves at a steady pace. His pieces cooperate nicely: the bishop on g7 protects the knight on c3, which protects the rook on a4, which in turn protects the bishop on c4 and forces Byrne&#x27;s queen away. 24...Nxd1? 25.Qxc4 is much less clear.

25. Qxb6
:Trying to protect his rook with 25.Qd6 loses the queen to 25...Nxd1 26.Qxd1 Rxa2 threatening 27...Ra1.
25... Nxd1 (see diagram)
:Fischer has gained a rook, two bishops, and a pawn for his sacrificed queen, leaving him ahead the equivalent, roughly, of one – an easily winning advantage in master play. White&#x27;s queen is far outmatched by Black&#x27;s pieces, which dominate the board and will soon overrun White&#x27;s position. Moreover, Byrne&#x27;s remaining rook is stuck on h1 and it will take precious time (and the loss of the pawn on f2) to free it. Byrne could have resigned here, but chose to play on until checkmate, as a courtesy to Fischer&#x27;s skill.

26. h3 Rxa2 27. Kh2 Nxf2 28. Re1 Rxe1 29. Qd8+ Bf8 30. Nxe1 Bd5 31. Nf3 Ne4 32. Qb8 b5
:Every piece and pawn of Black&#x27;s is defended, leaving White&#x27;s queen with nothing to do.

33. h4 h5 34. Ne5 Kg7
:Fischer breaks the pin, allowing the bishop to attack as well.
35. Kg1 Bc5+ (see diagram)
:Now Fischer uses his pieces in concert to force mate.

36. Kf1 Ng3+ 37. Ke1 Bb4+
:Kmoch notes that with 37...Re2+ Fischer could have mated a move sooner.

38. Kd1 Bb3+ 39. Kc1 Ne2+ 40. Kb1 Nc3+ 41. Kc1 Rc2 


Asked how he was able to pull off such a brilliant win, Fischer said: &quot;I just made the moves I thought were best. I was just lucky.&quot;

<text>In computer science, a join point is a point in the control flow of a program where the control flow can arrive via two different paths. In particular, it&#x27;s a basic block that has more than one predecessor. In aspect-oriented programming a set of join points is called a pointcut. A join point is a specification of when, in the corresponding main program, the aspect code should be executed.

The join point is a point of execution in the base code where the advice specified in a corresponding pointcut is applied.

<text>An open campaign is a activist or civil society campaign with a clear goal and transparent methods. This is contrast to political action planned secretly in closed groups. Open campaigns often seek meaningful involvement in campaign planning from a range of people affected by or interested in the campaign issue. One notable proponent of open campaigning is Greenpeace.

Open campaigns share information about their cause by various methods including social media, videos, public talks, organizing meetings, leaflet and mailing distribution, press releases, petitions. Action taken may include, writing letters to officials, public protest or direct action. The location and timing of a campaign is usually also an important consideration. Transparent fundraising may also be an element of an open campaign.

<text>In aspect-oriented programming, a pointcut is a set of join points. A pointcut specifies where exactly to apply an advice, which allows separation of concerns and helps in modularizing business logic. Pointcuts are often specified using class names or method names, in some cases using regular expressions that match class or method names. Different frameworks support different Pointcut expressions; AspectJ syntax is considered as de facto standard. Frameworks are available for various programming languages like Java, Perl, Ruby, and many more which support pointcuts.

== Background ==
Due to limitations in various programming languages, cross-cutting concern has not modularized. Cross-cutting concern refers to parts of software that logically belong to one module and affect the whole system: this could be security or logging, for example. Aspect-oriented programming tries to solve these cross cutting concerns by allowing programmers to write modules called aspects, which contain pieces of code executed at particular point. The expressions required to select a particular point led to creation of Pointcut Expressions.

==Execution==
Whenever the program execution reaches one of the join points described in the pointcut, a piece of code associated with the pointcut (called advice) is executed. This allows a programmer to describe where and when additional code should be executed in addition to already-defined behavior. Pointcut permits the addition of aspects to existing software, as well as the design of software with a clear separation of concerns, wherein the programmer weaves (merges) different aspects into a complete application.

== Example ==
Suppose there is an application where we can modify records in a database. Whenever users modify the database, we want to have a log of information regarding who is modifying the records. The traditional way to log is to call a log method just before modifying the database. With aspect-oriented programming, we can apply pointcut to the Modify Database method and have an advice that is called to log the required information.

== Expressions ==
Following are some important pointcut expressions supported by AspectJ. These expressions can be combined using logical operators.

execution(void User.setPassword(password))

This pointcut matches execution of the User.setPassword method.

call(void User.getPassword())

When User.getPassword is called, this pointcut is matched.

handler(ArrayIndexOutOfBounds)

Pointcut will match when there is an ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception

this(UserType)

Pointcut will match when the object currently executing is of UserType.

target(UserType)

Pointcut will match when the target object is of UserType.

within(UserType)

Pointcut will match when the code executing belongs to UserType.

== Criticisms ==
Pointcut languages impact important software properties like evolvability and comprehensibility in a negative way. There might be a possibility where there is a need to perform refactoring to define a correct aspect, which in general should not happen since refactoring is to make code cleaner. It is also not scalable when there are multiple aspects to be applied on the same code and each aspect requires a different refactoring. In general every aspect will be tightly coupled with an application&#x27;s structure as the pointcuts explicitly contain a method&#x27;s signature, so when an application changes the pointcut needs to be changed as well. This can be quite problematic for a developer.

<text>Delator (plural: &quot;delatores&quot;, feminine: &quot;delatrix&quot;) is Latin for a denouncer, one who indicates to a court another as having committed a punishable deed.

==Secular Roman law==

In Roman history, it was properly one who gave notice (&quot;deferre&quot;) to the treasury officials of monies that had become due to the imperial fiscus. This special meaning was extended to those who lodged information as to punishable offences, and further, to those who brought a public accusation (whether true or not) against any person (especially with the object of getting money). Although the word &quot;delator&quot; itself, for &quot;common informer,&quot; is confined to imperial times, the right of public accusation had long existed. When exercised from patriotic and disinterested motives, its effects were beneficial; but the moment the principle of reward was introduced, this was no longer the case. Sometimes the accuser was rewarded with the rights of citizenship, a place in the Senate, or a share of the property of the accused. At the end of the republican period, Cicero (&quot;De officiis&quot;, ii. 14) expresses his opinion that such accusations should be undertaken only in the interests of the state or for other urgent reasons.

Under the Roman Empire the system became openly corrupt, which reached its height during the reign of Tiberius, although the delators continued to exercise their activity till the reign of Theodosius I. They were drawn from all classes of society: patricians, equites, freedmen, slaves, philosophers, literary men, and, above all, lawyers. The objects of their attacks were the wealthy, all possible rivals of the emperor, and those whose conduct implied a reproach against the imperial mode of life. Special opportunities were afforded by the law of majestas, which was originally directed against attacks on the ruler by word or deed but came to include all kinds of accusations with which it really had nothing to do; indeed, according to Tacitus, a charge of treason was regularly added to all criminal charges. The chief motive for these accusations was no doubt the desire of amassing wealth, since by the law of majestas one-fourth of the goods of the accused, even if he committed suicide in order to avoid confiscation (which was always carried out in the case of those condemned to capital punishment), was assured to the accuser (who was hence called &quot;quadruplator&quot;).

Pliny the Elder and Martial mention instances of enormous fortunes amassed by professional delators. But it was not without its dangers. If the delator lost his case or refused to carry it through, he was liable to the same penalties as the accused; he was exposed to the risk of vengeance at the hands of the proscribed in the event of their return, or of their relatives; while emperors like Tiberius would have no scruples about banishing or putting out of the way those whom he had no further use for and who might have proved dangerous to himself.

Titus drove into exile or reduced to slavery those who had served Nero, after they had first been flogged in the amphitheatre. The abuses reappeared under Domitian; the delators, with whom Vespasian had not interfered, although he had abolished trials for majestas, were again banished by Trajan, and threatened with capital punishment in an edict of Constantine; but delating lasted till the end of the 4th century.

== Jewish law ==
==Canon law==
The term delatores was used by the Hispanian Synod of Elvira (c. 306) to stigmatize those Christians who appeared as accusers of their brethren. This synod decided that if any Christian was proscribed or put to death through the denunciation (&quot;delatio&quot;) of another Christian, such a delator was to suffer perpetual excommunication, an extreme ecclesiastical punishment.

No distinction is made between true and false accusation, but the synod probably meant only the accusation of Christianity before the pagan judges, or at most a false accusation. Any false accusation against a bishop, priest or deacon was visited with a similar punishment by the same synod. The punishment for false witness in general was proportioned by can. lxxiv to the gravity of the accusation.

The Council of Arles (314) issued a similar decree when it decided that Christians who accused falsely their brethren were to be forever excluded from communion with the faithful.

During the persecutions of the early Christians it sometimes happened that apostates denounced their fellow Christians. The younger Pliny relates in a letter to Trajan that an anonymous bill of indictment was presented to him on which were many names of Christians; we do not know if the author of this &quot;libellus&quot; was a Christian. According to can. xiii of the Council of Arles, during the persecution of Diocletian Christians were denounced by their own brethren to the pagan judges. If it appeared from the public acts that an ecclesiastic had done this, he was punished by the synod with perpetual deposition; however, his ordinations were still considered valid.

In general, false accusation is visited with severe punishments in later synods, e.g. Second Council of Arles, the Council of Agde and others. These decrees appear in the later medieval collections of canons.

New punitive decrees against calumny were issued by Pope Gregory IX in his Decretals.

==Uses as an English word==
See Owen J. Blum, OFM &quot;Peter Damian Letters 31–60&quot; (Washington D.C.: The Catholic University of America, 1990), 49 (&quot;being an informer and delator of my brother&#x27;s crimes&quot;).

In the alternate reality TV series &quot;An Englishman&#x27;s Castle&quot;, depicting a Nazi-occupied Britain, the word &quot;delator&quot; is revived in reference to informers helping the Nazi occupiers.

<text>Rebar (short for reinforcement bar or reinforcing bar), known when massed as reinforcing steel or steel reinforcement, is a tension device added to concrete to form &quot;reinforced concrete&quot; and reinforced masonry structures to strengthen and aid the concrete under tension. Concrete is strong under compression, but has low tensile strength. Rebar usually consists of steel bars which significantly increase the tensile strength of the structure. Rebar surfaces feature a continuous series of ribs, lugs or indentations to promote a better bond with the concrete and reduce the risk of slippage.

The most common type of rebar is carbon steel, typically consisting of hot-rolled round bars with deformation patterns embossed into its surface. Steel and concrete have similar coefficients of thermal expansion, so a concrete structural member reinforced with steel will experience minimal differential stress as the temperature changes.

Other readily available types of rebar are manufactured of stainless steel, and composite bars made of glass fiber, carbon fiber, or basalt fiber. The carbon steel reinforcing bars may also be coated in zinc or an epoxy resin designed to resist the effects of corrosion, especially when used in saltwater environments. Bamboo has been shown to be a viable alternative to reinforcing steel in concrete construction. These alternative types tend to be more expensive or may have lesser mechanical properties and are thus more often used in specialty construction where their physical characteristics fulfill a specific performance requirement that carbon steel does not provide.

==History==

Reinforcing bars in masonry construction have been used since antiquity, with Rome using iron or wooden rods in arch construction. Iron tie rods and anchor plates were later employed across Medieval Europe, as a device to reinforce arches, vaults, and cupolas. 2,500 meters of rebar was used in the 14th-century Château de Vincennes. 

During the 18th century, rebar was used to form the carcass of the Leaning Tower of Nevyansk in Russia, built on the orders of the industrialist Akinfiy Demidov. The wrought iron used for the rebar was of high quality, and there is no corrosion on the bars to this day. The carcass of the tower was connected to its cast iron tented roof, crowned with one of the first known lightning rods. 

However, not until the mid-19th century, with the embedding of steel bars into concrete (thus producing modern reinforced concrete), did rebar display its greatest strengths. Several people in Europe and North America developed reinforced concrete in the 1850s. These include Joseph-Louis Lambot of France, who built reinforced concrete boats in Paris (1854) and Thaddeus Hyatt of the United States, who produced and tested reinforced concrete beams. Joseph Monier of France is one of the most notable figures for the invention and popularization of reinforced concrete. As a French gardener, Monier patented reinforced concrete flowerpots in 1867, before proceeding to build reinforced concrete water tanks and bridges.

Ernest L. Ransome, an English engineer and architect who worked in the United States, made a significant contribution to the development of reinforcing bars in concrete construction. He invented twisted iron rebar, which he initially thought of while designing self-supporting sidewalks for the Masonic Hall in Stockton, California. His twisted rebar was, however, not initially appreciated and even ridiculed at the Technical Society of California, where members stated that the twisting would weaken the iron. In 1889, Ransome worked on the West Coast mainly designing bridges. One of these, the Alvord Lake Bridge in San Francisco&#x27;s Golden Gate Park, was the first reinforced concrete bridge built in the United States. He used twisted rebar in this structure.

At the same time Ransome was inventing twisted steel rebar, C.A.P. Turner was designing his &quot;mushroom system&quot; of reinforced concrete floor slabs with smooth round rods and Julius Kahn was experimenting with an innovative rolled diamond-shaped rebar with flat-plate flanges angled upwards at 45° (patented in 1902). Kahn predicted concrete beams with this reinforcing system would bend like a Warren truss, and also thought of this rebar as shear reinforcement. Kahn&#x27;s reinforcing system was built in concrete beams, joists, and columns. 

The system was both praised and criticized by Kahn&#x27;s engineering contemporaries: Turner voiced strong objections to this system as it could cause catastrophic failure to concrete structures. He rejected the idea that Kahn&#x27;s reinforcing system in concrete beams would act as a Warren truss and also noted that this system would not provide the adequate amount of shear stress reinforcement at the ends of the simply supported beams, the place where the shear stress is greatest. Furthermore, Turner warned that Kahn&#x27;s system could result in a brittle failure as it did not have longitudinal reinforcement in the beams at the columns. 

This type of failure manifested in the partial collapse of the Bixby Hotel in Long Beach, California and total collapse of the Eastman Kodak Building in Rochester, New York, both during construction in 1906. It was, however, concluded that both failures were the consequences of poor-quality labor. With the increase in demand of construction standardization, innovative reinforcing systems such as Kahn&#x27;s were pushed to the side in favor of the concrete reinforcing systems seen today.

Requirements for deformations on steel bar reinforcement were not standardized in US construction until about 1950. Modern requirements for deformations were established in &quot;Tentative Specifications for the Deformations of Deformed Steel Bars for Concrete Reinforcement&quot;, ASTM A305-47T. Subsequently, changes were made that increased rib height and reduced rib spacing for certain bar sizes, and the qualification of “tentative” was removed when the updated standard ASTM A305-49 was issued in 1949. The requirements for deformations found in current specifications for steel bar reinforcing, such as ASTM A615 and ASTM A706, among others, are the same as those specified in ASTM A305-49.

==Use in concrete and masonry==


Concrete is a material that is very strong in compression, but relatively weak in tension. To compensate for this imbalance in concrete&#x27;s behavior, rebar is cast into it to carry the tensile loads. Most steel reinforcement is divided into primary and secondary reinforcement:

*&quot;Primary reinforcement&quot; refers to the steel which is employed to guarantee the resistance needed by the structure as a whole to support the design loads.
*&quot;Secondary reinforcement&quot;, also known as distribution or thermal reinforcement, is employed for durability and aesthetic reasons, by providing enough localized resistance to limit cracking and resist stresses caused by effects such as temperature changes and shrinkage.

Secondary applications include rebar embedded in masonry walls, which includes both bars placed horizontally in a mortar joint (every fourth or fifth course of block) or vertically (in the horizontal voids of cement blocks and cored bricks, which is then fixed in place with grout. Masonry structures held together with grout have similar properties to concrete – high compressive resistance but a limited ability to carry tensile loads. When rebar is added they are known as &quot;reinforced masonry&quot;.

A similar approach (of embedding rebar vertically in designed voids in engineered blocks) is also used in dry-laid landscape walls, at least pinning the lowest course in place into the earth, also employed securing the lowest course and/or deadmen in walls made of engineered concrete or wooden landscape ties.

In unusual cases, steel reinforcement may be embedded and partially exposed, as in the steel tie bars that constrain and reinforce the masonry of Nevyansk Tower or ancient structures in Rome and the Vatican.

==Physical characteristics==
Steel has a thermal expansion coefficient nearly equal to that of modern concrete. If this were not so, it would cause problems through additional longitudinal and perpendicular stresses at temperatures different from the temperature of the setting. Although rebar has ribs that bind it mechanically to the concrete, it can still be pulled out of the concrete under high stresses, an occurrence that often accompanies a larger-scale collapse of the structure. To prevent such a failure, rebar is either deeply embedded into adjacent structural members (40–60 times the diameter), or bent and hooked at the ends to lock it around the concrete and other rebar. This first approach increases the friction locking the bar into place, while the second makes use of the high compressive strength of concrete.

Common rebar is made of unfinished tempered steel, making it susceptible to rusting. Normally the concrete cover is able to provide a pH value higher than 12 avoiding the corrosion reaction. Too little concrete cover can compromise this guard through carbonation from the surface, and salt penetration. Too much concrete cover can cause bigger crack widths which also compromises the local guard. As rust takes up greater volume than the steel from which it was formed, it causes severe internal pressure on the surrounding concrete, leading to cracking, spalling, and, ultimately, structural failure. This phenomenon is known as oxide jacking. 

This is a particular problem where the concrete is exposed to salt water, as in bridges where salt is applied to roadways in winter, or in marine applications. Uncoated, corrosion-resistant low-carbon/chromium (microcomposite), silicon bronze, epoxy-coated, galvanized, or stainless steel rebars may be employed in these situations at greater initial expense, but significantly lower expense over the service life of the project. 

Extra care is taken during the transport, fabrication, handling, installation, and concrete placement process when working with epoxy-coated rebar, because damage will reduce the long-term corrosion resistance of these bars. Even damaged epoxy-coated bars have shown better performance than uncoated reinforcing bars, though issues from debonding of the epoxy coating from the bars and corrosion under the epoxy film have been reported. These epoxy-coated bars are used in over 70,000 bridge decks in the US, but this technology was slowly being phased out in favor of stainless steel rebar as of 2005 because of its poor performance.

Requirements for deformations are found in US-standard product specifications for steel bar reinforcing, such as ASTM A615 and ASTM A706, and dictate lug spacing and height.

Fibre-reinforced plastic rebar is also used in high-corrosion environments. It is available in many forms, such as spirals for reinforcing columns, common rods, and meshes. Most commercially available rebar is made from unidirectional fibers set in a thermoset polymer resin and is often referred to as FRP.

Some special construction such as research and manufacturing facilities with very sensitive electronics may require the use of reinforcement that is non-conductive to electricity, and medical imaging equipment rooms may require non-magnetic properties to avoid interference. FRP rebar, notably glass fibre types have low electrical conductivity and are non-magnetic which is commonly used for such needs. Stainless steel rebar with low magnetic permeability is available and is sometimes used to avoid magnetic interference issues.

Reinforcing steel can also be displaced by impacts such as earthquakes, resulting in structural failure. The prime example of this is the collapse of the Cypress Street Viaduct in Oakland, California as a result of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, causing 42 fatalities. The shaking of the earthquake caused rebars to burst from the concrete and buckle. Updated building designs, including more circumferential rebar, can address this type of failure.

==Sizes and grades==

===US sizes===
US/Imperial bar sizes give the diameter in units of for bar sizes #2 through #8, so that #8 = inch = diameter. 

There are no fractional bar sizes in this system. The &quot;#&quot; symbol indicates the number sign, and thus &quot;#6&quot; is read as &quot;number six&quot;. The use of the &quot;#&quot; sign is customary for US sizes, but &quot;No.&quot; is sometimes used instead. Within the trades rebar is known by a shorthand utilizing the bar diameter as descriptor, such as &quot;four-bar&quot; for bar that is four-eighths (or one-half) of an inch. 

The cross-sectional area of a bar, as given by &quot;πr&quot;², works out to (bar size/9.027)², which is approximated as (bar size/9)² square inches. For example, the area of #8 bar is (8/9)² = 0.79 square inches. 

Bar sizes larger than #8 follow the -inch rule imperfectly and skip sizes #12–13, and #15–17 due to historical convention. In early concrete construction bars of one inch and larger were only available in square sections, and when large format deformed round bars became available around 1957, the industry manufactured them to provide the cross-sectional area equivalent of standard square bar sizes that were formerly used. The diameter of the equivalent large format round shape is rounded to the nearest inch to provide the bar size. For example, #9 bar has a cross section of , and therefore a diameter of . #10, #11, #14, and #18 sizes correspond to 1 inch, 1, 1, and 2-inch square bars, respectively.

Sizes smaller than #3 are no longer recognized as standard sizes. These are most commonly manufactured as plain round undeformed rod steel but can be made with deformations. Sizes smaller than #3 are typically referred to as &quot;wire&quot; products and not &quot;bar&quot; and specified by either their nominal diameter or wire gage number. #2 bars are often informally called &quot;pencil rod&quot; as they are about the same size as a pencil.

When US/Imperial sized rebar are used in projects with metric units, the equivalent metric size is typically specified as the nominal diameter rounded to the nearest millimeter. These are not considered standard metric sizes, and thus is often referred to as a soft conversion or the &quot;soft metric&quot; size. The US/Imperial bar size system recognizes the use of true metric bar sizes (No. 10, 12, 16, 20, 25, 28, 32, 36, 40, 50 and 60 specifically) which indicates the nominal bar diameter in millimeters, as an &quot;alternate size&quot; specification. Substituting a true metric size for a US/Imperial size is called a hard conversion, and sometimes results in the use of a physically different sized bar.



===Canadian sizes===
Metric bar designations represent the nominal bar diameter in millimeters, rounded to the nearest 5 mm.

===European sizes===
Metric bar designations represent the nominal bar diameter in millimetres. Preferred bar sizes in Europe are specified to comply with Table 6 of the standard EN 10080, although various national standards still remain in force (e.g. BS 4449 in the United Kingdom). In Switzerland some sizes are different from European standard.

===Australian sizes===
Reinforcement for use in concrete construction is subject to the requirements of Australian Standards AS3600 (Concrete Structures) and AS/NZS4671 (Steel Reinforcing for Concrete). There are other standards that apply to testing, welding and galvanizing.

The designation of reinforcement is defined in AS/NZS4671 using the following formats:

Shape/ Section

D- deformed ribbed bar, R- round / plain bar, I- deformed indented bar

Ductility Class

L- low ductility, N- normal ductility, E- seismic (Earthquake) ductility

Standard grades (MPa)

250N, 300E, 500L, 500N, 500E

:&quot;Examples:&quot;
:D500N12 is deformed bar, 500 MPa strength, normal ductility and 12 mm nominal diameter – also known as &quot;N12&quot;

Bars are typically abbreviated to simply &#x27;N&#x27; (hot-rolled deformed bar), &#x27;R&#x27; (hot-rolled round bar), &#x27;RW&#x27; (cold-drawn ribbed wire) or &#x27;W&#x27; (cold-drawn round wire), as the yield strength and ductility class can be implied from the shape. For example, all commercially available wire has a yield strength of 500 MPa and low ductility, while round bars are 250 MPa and normal ductility.

===New Zealand===
Reinforcement for use in concrete construction is subject to the requirements of AS/NZS4671 (Steel Reinforcing for Concrete). There are other standards that apply to testing, welding and galvanizing.

&quot;&#x27;Reinforcement steel bar Grade 300 &amp; 500 Class E&quot;
===India===
Rebars are available in the following grades as per IS:1786-2008 FE 415/FE 415D/FE 415S/FE 500/FE 500D/FE 500S/FE 550, FE550D, FE 600. Rebars are quenched with water at a high level pressure so that the outer surface is hardened while the inner core remains soft. Rebars are ribbed so that the concrete can have a better grip. Coastal regions use galvanized rebars to prolong their life. BIS rebar sizes are 10, 12, 16, 20, 25, 28, 32, 36, 40 and 50 millimeters.

===Jumbo and threaded bar sizes===
Very large format rebar sizes are widely available and produced by specialty manufacturers. The tower and sign industries commonly use &quot;jumbo&quot; bars as anchor rods for large structures which are fabricated from slightly oversized blanks such that threads can be cut at the ends to accept standard anchor nuts. Fully threaded rebar is also produced with very coarse threads which satisfy rebar deformation standards and allow for custom nuts and couplers to be used. These customary sizes, while in common use, do not have consensus standards associated with them, and properties may vary by manufacturer.

===Grades===
Rebar is available in grades and specifications that vary in yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, chemical composition, and percentage of elongation.

The use of a grade by itself only indicates the minimum permissible yield strength, and it must be used in the context of a material specification in order to fully describe product requirements for rebar. Material specifications set the requirements for grades as well as additional properties such as, chemical composition, minimum elongation, physical tolerances, etc. Fabricated rebar must exceed the grade&#x27;s minimum yield strength and any other material specification requirements when inspected and tested.

In US use, the grade designation is equal to the minimum yield strength of the bar in ksi (1000 psi); for example, grade 60 rebar has a minimum yield strength of 60 ksi. Rebar is most commonly manufactured in grades 40, 60, and 75 with higher strength readily available in grades 80, 100, 120 and 150. Grade 60 (420 MPa) is the most widely used rebar grade in modern US construction. Historic grades include 30, 33, 35, 36, 50 and 55, which are not in common use today.

Some grades are only manufactured for specific bar sizes; for example, under ASTM A615, Grade 40 (280 MPa) is only furnished for US bar sizes #3 through #6 (soft metric No.10 through 19). Sometimes limitations on available material grades for specific bar sizes is related to the manufacturing process used, as well as the availability of controlled quality raw materials used.

Some material specifications cover multiple grades, and in such cases it is necessary to indicate both the material specification and grade. Rebar grades are customarily noted on engineering documents, even when there are no other grade options within the material specification, in order to eliminate confusion and avoid potential quality issues such as might occur if a material substitution is made. &quot;Gr.&quot; is the common engineering abbreviation for &quot;grade&quot;, with variations on letter capitalization and the use of a period.

In certain cases, such as earthquake engineering and blast-resistant design where post-yield behavior is expected, it is important to be able to predict and control properties such as the maximum yield strength and minimum ratio of tensile strength to yield strength. ASTM A706 Gr. 60 is an example of a controlled property range material specification which has a minimum yield strength of 60 ksi (420 MPa), maximum yield strength of 78 ksi (540 MPa), minimum tensile strength of 80 ksi (550 MPa) and not less than 1.25 times the actual yield strength, and minimum elongation requirements that vary by bar size.

In countries that use the metric system, the grade designation is typically the yield strength in megapascals (MPa), for example &quot;grade 400&quot; (similar to US grade 60; however, metric grade 420 is actually the exact substitution for the US grade).

Historically in Europe, rebar is composed of mild steel material with a yield strength of approximately 250 MPa (36 ksi). Modern rebar is composed of high-yield steel, with a yield strength more typically 500 MPa (72.5 ksi). Rebar can be supplied with various grades of ductility. The more ductile steel is capable of absorbing considerably more energy when deformed – a behavior that resists earthquake forces and is used in design. These high-yield-strength ductile steels are usually produced using the TEMPCORE process, a method of thermomechanical processing. The manufacture of reinforcing steel by re-rolling finished products (e.g. sheets or rails) is not allowed. In contrast to structural steel, rebar steel grades are not harmonized yet across Europe, each country having their own national standards. However, some standardization of specification and testing methods exist under EN 10080 and EN ISO 15630:

==Placing rebar==
Rebar cages are fabricated either on or off the project site commonly with the help of hydraulic benders and shears. However, for small or custom work a tool known as a Hickey, or hand rebar bender, is sufficient. The rebars are placed by steel fixers (&quot;rodbusters&quot; or concrete reinforcing iron workers), with bar supports and concrete or plastic rebar spacers separating the rebar from the concrete formwork to establish concrete cover and ensure that proper embedment is achieved. The rebars in the cages are connected by spot welding, tying steel wire, sometimes using an electric rebar tier, or with mechanical connections. For tying epoxy-coated or galvanized rebars, epoxy-coated or galvanized wire is normally used, respectively.

===Stirrups===

Stirrups form the outer part of a rebar cage. The function of stirrups (often referred to as &#x27;reinforcing steel links&#x27; and &#x27;shear links&#x27;) is threefold: to give the main reinforcement bars structure, to maintain a correct level of concrete cover, and to maintain an equal transferance of force throughout the supporting elements. Stirrups are usually rectangular in beams, and circular in piers and are placed at regular intervals along a column or beam as defined by civil or structural engineers in construction drawings.

===Welding===
The American Welding Society (AWS) D 1.4 sets out the practices for welding rebar in the US. Without special consideration the only rebar that is ready to weld is &quot;W grade&quot; (Low-alloy — A706). Rebar that is not produced to the ASTM A706 specification is generally not suitable for welding without calculating the &quot;carbon-equivalent&quot;. Material with a carbon-equivalent of less than 0.55 can be welded.

ASTM A 616 &amp; ASTM A 617 (now replaced by the combined standard A996) reinforcing bars are re-rolled rail steel and re-rolled rail axle steel with uncontrolled chemistry, phosphorus and carbon content. These materials are not common.

Rebar cages are normally tied together with wire, although spot welding of cages has been the norm in Europe for many years, and is becoming more common in the United States. High strength steels for prestressed concrete cannot be welded.

=== Reinforcement placement in rolls ===
Roll reinforcement system is a remarkably fast and cost-efficient method for placing a large quantity of reinforcement over a short period of time. Roll reinforcement is usually prepared off-site and easily unrolled on site. Roll reinforcement placement has been applied successfully in slabs (decks, foundations), wind energy mast foundations, walls, ramps, etc.

===Mechanical connections===
Also known as &quot;mechanical couplers&quot; or &quot;mechanical splices&quot;, mechanical connections are used to connect reinforcing bars together. Mechanical couplers are an effective means to reduce rebar congestion in highly reinforced areas for cast-in-place concrete construction. These couplers are also used in precast concrete construction at the joints between members.

The structural performance criteria for mechanical connections varies between countries, codes, and industries. As a minimum requirement, codes typically specify that the rebar to splice connection meets or exceeds 125% of the specified yield strength of the rebar. More stringent criteria also requires the development of the specified ultimate strength of the rebar. As an example, ACI 318 specifies either Type 1 (125% Fy) or Type 2 (125% Fy and 100% Fu) performance criteria.

For concrete structures designed with ductility in mind, it is recommended that the mechanical connections are also capable of failing in a ductile manner, typically known in the reinforcing steel industry as achieving &quot;bar-break&quot;. As an example, Caltrans specifies a required mode of failure (i.e., &quot;necking of the bar&quot;).

===Safety===

To prevent injury, the protruding ends of steel rebar are often bent over or covered with special steel-reinforced plastic caps.

==Designations==
Reinforcement is usually tabulated in a &quot;reinforcement schedule&quot; on construction drawings. This eliminates ambiguity in the notations used around the world. The following list provides examples of the notations used in the architectural, engineering, and construction industry.

==Reuse and recycling==
Rebar is frequently recycled, and rebar is often made entirely from recycled steel. Nucor, the largest steel producer in the United States, claims its steel bar products are made from 97% recycled steel.

<text>James Prince Lee (28 July 1804 – 24 December 1869) was an English clergyman and schoolmaster who became head master of King Edward&#x27;s School, Birmingham, and was later the first Bishop of Manchester.

==Early life==
Born in London, Lee was educated at St Paul&#x27;s School, London, and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he displayed exceptional ability as a classical scholar, graduating with a bachelor of arts degree in 1828; this was promoted by seniority to master of arts in 1831 and in 1861 he was awarded the degree of doctor of divinity. He married Susannah, elder daughter of George Penrice, of Elmbridge, Worcestershire, on 25 December 1830, and they had two daughters.

==Teaching career==
After his ordination into the Church of England priesthood in 1830, Lee served as an assistant schoolmaster at Rugby School under Thomas Arnold, who thought highly of him. In 1837, he became rector of Ayot St Peter, Hertfordshire, and in 1838 headmaster of King Edward&#x27;s School, Birmingham, where he had among his pupils Edward Burne-Jones, Richard Watson Dixon, Edward White Benson, Joseph Barber Lightfoot, and Brooke Foss Westcott. There is also a house of the school named after him. In 1847 he was appointed as an honorary canon of Worcester Cathedral.

==Episcopal career==
On 23 October 1847, Lee was nominated as the first bishop of the newly constituted Anglican Diocese of Manchester by Queen Victoria, on the advice of the prime minister of the day, Lord John Russell. His election took place on 17 November 1847, followed by consecration on 23 January 1848, and enthronement at Manchester Cathedral on 11 February 1848.

Lee&#x27;s schoolmasterly manner was an irritation to his clergy. However, he carried out great work in church extension. During his twenty-one years&#x27; tenure of the see, he consecrated 130 churches. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1849. He took a foremost part in founding the Manchester free library in 1852, and bequeathed his own valuable collection of books to Owens College.

He died at his home, Mauldeth Hall, Stockport, in 1869, and was buried in Heaton Mersey churchyard. His memorial sermon was preached by the Rev. Edward Benson (afterwards archbishop of Canterbury) and was published with biographical details by J. F. Wickenden and others.

<text>Peter Gunning (1614 – 6 July 1684) was an English Royalist church leader, Bishop of Chichester and Bishop of Ely.

==Life==
He was born at Hoo St Werburgh, in Kent, and educated at The King&#x27;s School, Canterbury and Clare College, Cambridge, where he became a fellow in 1633. Having taken orders, he advocated the Royalist cause eloquently from the pulpit. In 1644, during the English Civil War, he retired to Oxford, and held a chaplaincy at New College until the city surrendered to the Parliamentary forces in 1646. Subsequently he was chaplain, first to the royalist Sir Robert Shirley of Eatington (1629–1656), and then at the Exeter House chapel. After the Restoration in 1660 he was installed as a canon of Canterbury Cathedral. In the same year he returned to Cambridge as Master of Corpus Christi, and was appointed Lady Margaret&#x27;s Professor of Divinity. He also received the livings of Cottesmore, Rutland, and Stoke Bruerne, Northamptonshire.

In 1661 he became head of St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, and was elected Regius Professor of Divinity. While he served as Regius Professor of Divinity he established an Arminian soteriological tradition at Cambridge that was furthered by his successor Joseph Beaumont. He was consecrated bishop of Chichester in 1669, and was translated to the see of Ely in 1674–1675. Holding moderate religious views, he disliked equally Puritanism and Roman Catholicism.

==Works==
His works are chiefly reports of his disputations, such as that which appears in the &quot;Scisme Unmask&#x27;t&quot; (Paris, 1658), in which the definition of a schism is discussed with two Roman Catholic opponents John Spenser and John Lenthall.

==Family==
A relative of his, Sir Robert Gunning, became a famous diplomat.

<text>A chine () is a steep-sided coastal gorge where a river flows to the sea through, typically, soft eroding cliffs of sandstone or clays. The word is still in use in central Southern England—notably in East Devon, Dorset, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight—to describe such topographical features. The term &#x27;bunny&#x27; is sometimes used to describe a chine in Hampshire. The term chine is also used in some Vancouver suburbs in Canada to describe similar features.

==Formation and features==
Chines appear at the outlet of small river valleys when a particular combination of geology, stream volume, and coastal recession rate creates a knickpoint, usually starting at a waterfall at the cliff edge, that initiates rapid erosion and deepening of the stream bed into a gully leading down to the sea.

All chines are in a state of constant change due to erosion. The Blackgang Chine on the Isle of Wight, for example, has been destroyed by landslides and coastal erosion during the 20th century. As the walls of the chines and cliffs are so unstable and erode continually, particularly those of the south coast of the Isle of Wight, the strata are clearly visible. Chines are, therefore, very important for their fossil records, their archaeology and the unique flora and fauna, such as invertebrates and rare insects, for which they provide shelter.

In Devon, Sherbrooke Chine is west of Budleigh Salterton, and Seaton Chine is at the western end of the West Walk esplanade, Seaton. In Dorset, west of Bournemouth are found Flaghead Chine, Branksome Chine, Alum Chine, Middle Chine and Durley Chine, and east towards Boscombe, Boscombe Chine and Honeycombe Chine. Bournemouth Town Centre itself is built in the former Bourne Chine (the Pleasure Gardens being the original valley floor), although urban development since the late 19th century has altered the topography somewhat. Becton Bunny and Chewton Bunny are other examples of chines near Barton on Sea, Hampshire (&quot;Bunny&quot; being the New Forest equivalent to &quot;Chine&quot;). In Ramsgate, Kent, there is Courtstairs Chine, leading from the cliff top to the undercliff promenade.

A rare example of the use of &#x27;Chine&#x27; in a non-coastal setting is Chineham, a civil parish near Basingstoke.

==On the Isle of Wight==

There are twenty chines on the Isle of Wight, to which fascinating folklore is attached because of their history with local smuggling, fishing and shipwrecks. The popular tourist attraction of Shanklin Chine is also famous for its involvement in the Second World War, when it was used to carry one of the Operation Pluto pipelines and as training area for the 40 Royal Marine Commando battalion before the 1942 Dieppe Raid.

Geologically, the chines in Alum Bay, in Totland (Widdick Chine), and the three in Colwell Bay (Colwell Chine, Brambles Chine and Linstone Chine) are in Tertiary rocks. The remainder on the island&#x27;s south coast are in Cretaceous rocks.

==In Canada==

The Vancouver suburb of Coquitlam has a neighbourhood called &quot;Harbour Chines&quot; that was built in the 1950s, along with the adjoining neighbourhood of &quot;Chineside&quot; to the east. Both are situated upon the tops of cliffs that overlook a large number of streams flowing down to the adjoining suburb of Port Moody&#x27;s &quot;Chines Park&quot;, from where they flow to Burrard Inlet, onwards out to the Georgia Strait of the Salish Sea, and the Pacific Ocean.

<text>Ernst Willibald Emil Hübner (7 July 183421 February 1901) was a German classical scholar.

He was born at Düsseldorf, the son of the historical painter Julius Hübner (1806–1882).
After studying at Berlin and Bonn, he traveled extensively with a view to antiquarian and epigraphical researches. The results of these travels were published in several important works: &quot;Inscriptiones Hispaniae Latinae&quot; (1869, supplement 1892), &quot;Inscriptiones Hispaniae Christianae&quot; (1871, supplement 1900); &quot;Inscriptiones Britanniae Latinae&quot; (1873), &quot;Inscriptiones Britanniae Christianae&quot; (1876); &quot;La Arqueologia de Espana&quot; (1888); &quot;Monumenta Linguae Ibericae&quot; (1893).

Hübner also wrote two books for the classical student: &quot;Grundriss zu Vorlesungen über die römische Litteraturgeschichte&quot; (4th edition, 1878, edited, with large additions, by JEB Mayor as &quot;Bibliographical clue to Latin literature&quot;, 1875), and &quot;Bibliographie der klassischen Alterthumswissenschaft&quot; (2nd edition, 1889). He was also author of &quot;Römische Epigraphik&quot; (2nd edition, 1892); &quot;Exempla Scripturae Epigraphicae Latinae&quot; (1885); and &quot;Römische Herrschaft in Westeuropa&quot; (1890).

In 1870 Hübner was appointed professor of classical philology at the University of Berlin, where he died.

<doc id="234436" wikidata="Q532018" url="?curid=234436" title="Hilary of Arles">
<text>Hilary of Arles, also known by his Latin name Hilarius (c. 403–449), was a bishop of Arles in Southern France. He is venerated as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church and Roman Catholic Church, with 5 May being his feast day.

== Life ==
In his early youth, or the 420s, Hilary joined the abbey of Lérins which was, at the time, presided over by his kinsman Honoratus. Hilary seems to have been living in Dijon before this, although other authorities believe he came from Belgica, or Provence. Hilary may have been a relative or &quot;even the son&quot; of the Hilarius who had been prefect of Gaul in 396 and of Rome in 408.

Hilary succeeded his kinsman Honoratus as bishop of Arles in 429. Following the example of Augustine of Hippo, he is said to have organized his cathedral clergy into a &quot;congregation,&quot; devoting a great part of their time to social exercises of asceticism. He held the rank of metropolitan bishop of Vienne and Narbonne, and attempted to exercise the sort of primacy over the church of south Gaul, which seemed implied in the vicariate granted to his predecessor Patroclus of Arles (417).

Hilary deposed the bishop of Besançon, Chelidonus, for ignoring this primacy, and for claiming a metropolitan dignity for Besançon. An appeal was made to Rome, and Pope Leo I used it, in 444, to extinguish the Gallican vicariate headed by Hilary, thus depriving him of his rights to consecrate bishops, call synods, or oversee the church in the province. The pope also secured the edict of Valentinian III, so important in the history of the Gallican church, which freed the Church of Vienne from all dependence on that of Arles. These papal claims were made imperial law, and violation of them were subject to legal penalties. Léon Clugnet suggests that the dispute arose from the fact that the respective rights of the Court of Rome and of the metropolitan were not sufficiently clearly established at that time, and that the right of appeal to the pope was not explicitly enough recognized.

Following his death in 449, Hilary&#x27;s name was introduced into the Roman martyrology.

== Writings ==
During his lifetime Hilary had a great reputation for learning and eloquence as well as for piety; his extant works (&quot;Vita S. Honorati Arelatensis episcopi&quot; and &quot;Metrum in Genesin&quot;) compare favourably with any similar literary productions of that period.

A poem, &quot;De providentia&quot;, usually included among the writings of Prosper of Aquitaine, is sometimes attributed to Hilary of Arles.

<doc id="234439" wikidata="Q454652" url="?curid=234439" title="Prosper of Aquitaine">
<text>Prosper of Aquitaine (; – AD), also called &quot;Prosper Tiro&quot;, was a Christian writer and disciple of Augustine of Hippo, and the first continuator of Jerome&#x27;s Universal Chronicle. Particularly, Prosper is identified with the (later) axiom &quot;—&#x27;the law [or &quot;those things&quot;] we pray is the law we believe is the law we live.&#x27;

== Life ==
Prosper was a native of Aquitaine, and may have been educated at Bordeaux. By 417 he arrived in Marseille as a refugee from Aquitaine in the aftermath of the Gothic invasions of Gaul. In 429 he was corresponding with Augustine. In 431 he appeared in Rome to appeal to Pope Celestine I regarding the teachings of Augustine; there is no further trace of him until 440, the first year of the pontificate of Pope Leo I, who had been in Gaul, where he may have met Prosper. In any case Prosper was soon in Rome, attached to the pope in some secretarial or notarial capacity. Gennadius of Massilia&#x27;s &quot;De viris illustribus&quot; (lxxxiv, 89) repeats the tradition that Prosper dictated the famous letters of Leo I against Eutyches. The date of his death is not known, but his chronicle goes as far as 455, and the fact that the chronicler Marcellinus mentions him under the year 463 seems to indicate that his death was shortly after that date.

Prosper was a layman, but he threw himself with ardour into the religious controversies of his day, defending Augustine and propagating orthodoxy. In his &quot;De vocatione omnium gentium&quot; (&quot;The Call of all Nations&quot;), in which the issues of the call to the Gentiles is discussed in the light of Augustine&#x27;s doctrine of Grace, Prosper appears as the first of the medieval Augustinians.

The Pelagians were attacked in a glowing polemical poem of about 1000 lines, &quot;Adversus ingratos&quot;, written about 430. The theme, &quot;dogma quod ... pestifero vomuit coluber sermone Britannus&quot;, is relieved by a treatment not lacking in liveliness and in classical measures. After Augustine&#x27;s death he wrote three series of Augustinian defences, especially against Vincent of Lérins (&quot;Pro Augustino responsiones&quot;).

His chief work was his &quot;De gratia Dei et libero arbitrio&quot; (432), written against John Cassian&#x27;s &quot;Collatio&quot;. He also induced Pope Celestine to publish an open letter to the bishops of Gaul, &quot;Epistola ad episcopos Gallorum&quot; against some members of the Gaulish Church. He had earlier opened a correspondence with Augustine, along with his friend Hilary (not Hilary of Arles), and although he did not meet him personally, his enthusiasm for the great theologian led him to make an abridgment of his commentary on the Psalms, as well as a collection of sentences from his works—probably the first dogmatic compilation of that class in which Peter Lombard&#x27;s &quot;Liber sententiarum&quot; is the best-known example. He also put into elegiac metre, in 106 epigrams, some of Augustine&#x27;s theological dicta.

Far more important historically than these is Prosper&#x27;s &quot;Epitoma chronicon&quot; (covering the period 379–455) which Prosper first composed in 433 and updated several times, finally in 455. It was circulated in numerous manuscripts and was soon continued by other hands, whose beginning dates identify Prosper&#x27;s various circulated editions. The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; 1911 found it a careless compilation from Jerome in the earlier part, and from other writers in the later, but that the lack of other sources makes it very valuable for the period from 425 to 455, which is drawn from Prosper&#x27;s personal experience. Compared with his continuators, Prosper gives detailed coverage of political events. He covers Attila&#x27;s invasions of Gaul (451) and Italy (452) in lengthy entries under their respective years. Though he was a poet himself, the sole secular writer Prosper mentions is Claudian. There were five different editions, the last of them dating from 455, just after the death of Valentinian III. 

For a long time the &quot;Chronicon imperiale&quot; was wrongly attributed to him. It is entirely independent of the real Prosper, and in parts even shows Pelagian tendencies and sympathies.

==Writings==
Prosper of Aquitaine&#x27;s most influential writings are admired for their classical qualities, but have been criticized for being flat and dull. His writings come mostly from the second quarter of the fifth century.

;&quot;De vocatione omnium gentium&quot; (&quot;Calling of All Nations&quot;)

This was Prosper&#x27;s attempt to reconcile Augustine of Hippo&#x27;s teaching on grace in which he suggests that God wishes all men to be saved. The argument is that although all human beings do not receive the grace that saves, they do receive God&#x27;s general grace. Written in AD 450, the &quot;Calling of All Nations&quot; was Prosper&#x27;s most original contribution to theology.

;&quot;Epitoma Chronicon&quot;

This was Prosper&#x27;s version of the history of the World. In it he sought to give his own version of the Pelagian controversy and in his own interpretation of recent history. The &quot;Epitoma Chronicon&quot; ends in 455.

;&quot;Capitulla&quot;

This was a simple list of ten doctrinal points asserting the efficacy and necessity of God&#x27;s Grace, each separately supported by papal statements. It was a strong defense of an essential Augustinian doctrine, but most moderate one to its date. Prosper did not mention Augustine&#x27;s name in the doctrine, but also did not reject any of his thoughts on predestination. It was written between 435 and 442.

;&quot;Sententia&quot; and &quot;Epigrammata&quot;

The Sententia was a collection of 392 maxims drawn up against the writings of Augustine of Hippo. The epigrammata was a compilation of 106 epigrams of florilegium in verse. Both were intended to be used as handbooks for the serious Christian, drawn from an Augustinian point of view. The work was devoted to the discussion of doctrines of grace and the incarnation. The motto of the florilegia was monastically influenced, urging the reader to patience through adversity, exercise of virtue, and constant striving to perfection.

This writing represents the final opinion of Prosper on the problem of necessity of grace. It was written during the reign of Pope Sixtus III (link) and is a step-by step response to Conference XIII of the &quot;Conlationes&quot; of John Cassian.

;&quot;Carmen de Providentia Divina&quot; (&quot;Poem on Divine Providence&quot;)

The problem of providence is discussed in the context of God&#x27;s creation of the World and in relation to the invasion of Gaul by the Vandals and the Goths. This work has been attributed to Prosper of Aquitaine in the past, but this theory has been discredited.

==Legacy==
&quot;Prosper of Aquitaine was much more famous for what he wrote than for what he did.&quot; (Abbé L. Valentin) However, many historians believe his chief fame rests not on his historical work, but on his activities as a theologian and an aggressive propagator of the Augustinian doctrine of grace. It is no doubt that Prosper holds a place in the ranks of the moulders of theological understanding of the doctrine of grace.

Most of his works were aimed at defending and distributing Augustine&#x27;s teachings, especially those pertaining to grace and free will. Following Augustine&#x27;s death in 430, Prosper continued to disseminate his teachings and spent his life working to make them acceptable. Prosper was the first chronicler to add to Jerome&#x27;s account, beginning his continuation half a century later. Prosper&#x27;s epigrams became most popular in his later years, providing a method for students of Christianity to learn moral lessons and aspects of the Augustinian doctrine.

Prosper also played a vital role in the Pelagian controversy in southern Gaul in the 420&#x27;s. With the help of Augustine and Pope Celestine, Prosper was able to put down revolutions of the Pelagian Christians.

Prosper&#x27;s works were very popular during the Middle Ages: the &quot;Epigrams&quot; alone sum no fewer than one hundred and eighty manuscripts.

==Editions==
Prosper&#x27;s &quot;Epitoma Chronicon&quot; was edited by Theodor Mommsen in the &quot;Chronica minora&quot; of the &quot;Monumenta Germaniae Historica&quot; (1892) and by Maria Becker and Jan–Markus Kötter as part of the &quot;Kleine und fragmentarische Historiker&quot; &quot;(KFHist G 5)&quot; (2016). Prosper&#x27;s complete works are in Migne&#x27;s &quot;Patrologia Latina&quot;. vol. 51.

<doc id="234442" wikidata="Q656544" url="?curid=234442" title="Cambridge Five">
<text>The Cambridge Five was a ring of spies in the United Kingdom that passed information to the Soviet Union during the Second World War and the Cold War and was active from the 1930s until at least the early 1950s. None of the known members were ever prosecuted for spying. The number and membership of the ring emerged slowly, from the 1950s onwards.

The general public first became aware of the conspiracy in 1951 after the sudden flight of Donald Maclean (1913–1983, codename Homer) and Guy Burgess (1911–1963, codename Hicks) to the Soviet Union. Suspicion immediately fell on Kim Philby (1912–1988, codenames Sonny, Stanley), who eventually fled to the Soviet Union in 1963. Following Philby&#x27;s flight, British intelligence obtained confessions from Anthony Blunt (1907–1983, codename Johnson) and then John Cairncross (1913–1995, codename Liszt), who have come to be seen as the last two of a group of five. Their involvement was kept secret for many years: until 1979 for Blunt, and 1990 for Cairncross. The moniker Cambridge Four evolved to become the Cambridge Five after Cairncross was added.

The group were recruited by the NKVD during their education at the University of Cambridge in the 1930s, but the exact timing is debated. Blunt claimed they were not recruited as agents until after they had graduated. A Fellow of Trinity College, Blunt was several years older than Burgess, Maclean and Philby; he acted as a talent-spotter and recruiter.

The five were convinced that the Marxism–Leninism of Soviet communism was the best available political system and the best defence against fascism. All pursued successful careers in branches of the British government. They passed large amounts of intelligence to the Soviets, so much so that the KGB became suspicious that at least some of it was false. Perhaps as important as the specific state secrets was the demoralising effect to the British establishment of their slow unmasking and the mistrust in British security this caused in the United States.

Many others have also been accused of membership in the Cambridge ring.

==Membership==
The following five supplied intelligence to the Soviet Union under their NKVD controller, Yuri Modin, who later reported that Soviet intelligence mistrusted the Cambridge double agents during the Second World War and had difficulty believing that the men would have access to top secret documents; they were particularly suspicious of Harold &quot;Kim&quot; Philby, wondering how he could have become a British intelligence officer given his communist past. One report later stated, &quot;About half the documents the British spies sent to Moscow were never even read&quot; due to Soviet paranoia. Nonetheless, the Soviets received a great deal of secret information1,771 documents from Blunt, 4,605 from Burgess, 4,593 from MacLean and 5,832 from Cairncrossfrom 1941 until 1945.

=== Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess ===
Donald Maclean met Guy Burgess as a student at the University of Cambridge in the early 1930s. Having both disagreed with the idea of capitalism, they were recruited by Soviet intelligence operatives and became undercover agents. Maclean began delivering information to the Soviet operatives as a member of the Foreign Office in 1934. Burgess also began supplying information from various positions between 1936 and 1944, first as a BBC correspondent, then as an active member of British intelligence, and then finally as a member of the Foreign Office.

Maclean and Burgess were reportedly seen by their Soviet handlers as &quot;hopeless drunks&quot; as they had a hard time keeping their secret occupations to themselves. It is said that one time, while highly intoxicated, Burgess accidentally dropped one of the secret files he had taken from the Foreign Office while leaving a pub, jeopardizing his second identity. Maclean was also known to have leaked information about his secret activities to his brother and close friends. But although they struggled to keep secrets, that did not stop them from delivering information; Burgess reportedly handed over about 389 top secret documents to the Soviets within the early part of 1945, along with an additional 168 documents in December 1949.

Between 1934 and 1951, Maclean passed numerous secrets to Moscow. The lack of detection was due to the refusal of British intelligence to listen to warnings from the US, &quot;even after the FBI had established that an agent code-named Homer had been operating inside the British embassy in Washington during the war&quot;, according to a review of MacLean&#x27;s biography by Roland Philipps.

Philby, when he was posted in the British embassy in Washington after the war, learned that American and British authorities were searching for a mole (cryptonym Homer) in the British embassy who was passing information to the Soviets, relying on material uncovered by the Venona project. He further learned one of the suspects was Maclean. Realizing he had to act fast, he ordered Burgess, who was also on the embassy staff and living with Philby, to warn Maclean in England. Burgess was recalled from the US because of &quot;bad behaviour&quot; and, upon reaching London, warned Maclean.
Burgess and Maclean disappeared in the summer of 1951, and spent most of the next four years living covertly in Kuybyshev, Russian SFSR. Their whereabouts were unclear for some time and their defection was not confirmed until 1956 when the two appeared at a press conference in Moscow. Though Burgess was not supposed to defect at the same time as Maclean, it has been claimed that he had been ordered to do so by his controllers in Moscow. The move immediately cast suspicion upon Philby because of his close association with Burgess; many speculate that had the defection proceeded differently, Philby could have climbed even higher within British intelligence.

In 2019, Russia honoured Burgess and Maclean in a ceremony; a plaque was attached to the building where they had lived in the 1950s. The head of Russia&#x27;s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) praised the duo on social media for &quot;having supplied Soviet intelligence with the most important information for more than 20 years, [making] a significant contribution to the victory over fascism, the protection of our strategic interests and ensuring the safety of our country&quot;.

A book review in &quot;The Guardian&quot; of Stewart Purvis and Jeff Hulbert&#x27;s biography of Burgess included this conclusion: &quot;[leaving] us all the more astonished that such a smelly, scruffy, lying, gabby, promiscuous, drunken slob could penetrate the heart of the establishment without anyone apparently noticing that he was also a Soviet masterspy&quot;. Andrew Lownie&#x27;s biography of Burgess, &quot;Stalin&#x27;s Englishman: The Lives of Guy Burgess&quot;, argues that he was perhaps the most influential of all the members of the Cambridge Five.

===Kim Philby===
Harold &quot;Kim&quot; Philby was a senior officer in Britain&#x27;s Secret Intelligence Service, known as MI6, who began to spy for the Soviet Union in 1934. He was known for passing more than 900 British documents over to the NKVD and its successor, the KGB. He served as a double agent.

After the flight of Maclean and Burgess, an investigation of Philby found several suspicious matters but nothing for which he could be prosecuted. Nevertheless, he was forced to resign from MI6. In 1955 he was named in the press, with questions also raised in the House of Commons, as chief suspect for &quot;the Third Man&quot; and he called a press conference to deny the allegation. That same year, Philby was ruled out as a suspect when British Foreign Secretary Harold Macmillan cleared him of all charges.

In the later 1950s, Philby left the Secret Service and began working as a journalist in the Middle East, writing for &quot;The Economist&quot; and &quot;The Observer&quot;. MI6 then re-employed him at around the same time to provide reports from that region.

In 1961, defector Anatoliy Golitsyn provided information which pointed to Philby. An MI6 officer and friend of Philby from his earlier MI6 days, Nicholas Elliott, was sent in 1963 to interview him in Beirut and reported that Philby seemed to know he was coming (indicating the presence of yet another mole in MI6). Nonetheless, Philby allegedly confessed to Elliott.

Shortly afterwards, apparently fearing he might be abducted in Lebanon, Philby defected to the Soviet Union under cover of night aboard a Soviet freighter. For the first seven years in Moscow, he was under virtual house arrest since the Soviets were concerned that he might defect back to the West. According to an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, he was given no rank nor an office. In fact, &quot;for the most part, Philby was frozen out, his suggestions ignored ... This ruined his life&quot;. After his death, however, Philby was awarded a number of medals by the Soviets.

===Anthony Blunt===
Anthony Blunt was a former Surveyor of the King&#x27;s Pictures and later Queen&#x27;s Pictures for the royal art collection. He served as an MI5 member and supplied secret information to the KGB, while also providing warnings to fellow agents of certain counterintelligence that could potentially endanger them.

In 1964, MI5 received information from the American Michael Whitney Straight pointing to Blunt&#x27;s espionage; the two had known each other at Cambridge some thirty years before and Blunt recruited Straight as a spy.

Blunt was interrogated by MI5 and confessed in exchange for immunity from prosecution. As he was—by 1964—without access to classified information, he had secretly been granted immunity by the Attorney General, in exchange for revealing everything he knew. Peter Wright, one of Blunt&#x27;s interrogators, describes in his book &quot;Spycatcher&quot; how Blunt was evasive and only made admissions grudgingly, when confronted with the undeniable.

By 1979, Blunt was publicly accused of being a Soviet agent by investigative journalist Andrew Boyle, in his book &quot;Climate of Treason&quot;. In November 1979, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher admitted to the House of Commons that Blunt had confessed to being a Soviet spy fifteen years previously.

The term &quot;Five&quot; began to be used in 1961, when KGB defector Anatoliy Golitsyn named Maclean and Burgess as part of a &quot;Ring of Five&quot;, with Philby a &#x27;probable&#x27; third, alongside two other agents whom he did not know.

Of all the information provided by Golitsyn, the only item that was ever independently confirmed was the Soviet affiliation of John Vassall. Vassall was a relatively low-ranking spy who some researchers believe may have been sacrificed to protect a more senior one.

At the time of Golitsyn&#x27;s defection, Philby had already been accused in the press and was living in Beirut, Lebanon, a country with no extradition agreement with Britain. Select members of MI5 and MI6 already knew Philby to be a spy from Venona project decryptions. Golitsyn also provided other information, such as the claim that Harold Wilson (then Prime Minister) was a KGB agent.

Golitsyn&#x27;s reliability remains a controversial subject and as such, there is little certainty of the number of agents he assigned to the Cambridge spy ring. To add to the confusion, when Blunt finally confessed, he named several other people as having been recruited by him.

Blunt wrote his memoirs but insisted they not be released until 25 years after his death. They were made public by the British Library in 2009. The manuscript indicated that he regretted having passed information to the Soviets because of the way it eventually affected his life, that he believed that the government would never reveal his treachery and that he had dismissed suicide as &quot;cowardly&quot;. Christopher Andrew felt that the regret was shallow, and that he found an &quot;unwillingness to acknowledge the evil he had served in spying for Stalin&quot;.

===John Cairncross===
John Cairncross was known as a British literary scholar until he was later identified as a Soviet atomic spy. While a civil servant in the Foreign Office, he was recruited in 1937 by James Klugmann to become a Soviet spy. He moved to the Treasury in 1938 but transferred once again to the Cabinet Office in 1940 where he served as the private secretary of Sir Maurice Hankey, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster at that time. In May 1942, he transferred to the British cryptanalysis agency, the Government Code and Cypher School, at Bletchley Park and then, in 1943, to MI6. Following World War II, it is said that Cairncross leaked information regarding the new NATO alliance to the Soviets.

On the basis of the information provided by Golitsyn, speculations raged on for many years as to the identity of the &quot;Fifth Man&quot;. The journalistic popularity of this phrase owes something to the unrelated novels &quot;The Third Man&quot; and &quot;The Tenth Man&quot;, written by Graham Greene who, coincidentally, worked with Philby and Cairncross during the Second World War.

Cairncross confessed to having been a spy for the Soviets in a 1964 meeting with MI6 that was kept secret for some years. He was given immunity from prosecution.

The public became aware of his treachery in December 1979, however, when Cairncross made a public confession to journalist Barrie Penrose. The news was widely publicized leading many to surmise that he was in fact the &quot;fifth man&quot;; that was confirmed in 1989 by KGB agent Oleg Gordievsky who had defected to Britain.

His designation as the fifth man was also confirmed in former KGB agent Yuri Modin&#x27;s book published in 1994: &quot;My Five Cambridge Friends: Burgess, Maclean, Philby, Blunt, and Cairncross&quot;.

Cairncross is not always considered to have been part of the &#x27;Ring of Five&#x27;. Though a student at the University of Cambridge, he only knew Blunt, who was by then teaching modern languages. By 1934, when Cairncross arrived at Cambridge, the other three members of the ring had already graduated.

 This reference suggests the KGB itself recognized Cairncross as the fifth man (found by Gordievsky while doing research on the history of the KGB).

A few sources, however, believe that the &quot;fifth man&quot; was Victor Rothschild, 3rd Baron Rothschild. In his book &quot;The Fifth Man&quot;, Roland Perry asserts this claim. After the book was published, former KGB controller Yuri Modin denied ever having named Rothschild as &quot;any kind of Soviet agent&quot;. Modin&#x27;s own book&#x27;s title clarifies the name of all five of the Cambridge spy group: &quot;My Five Cambridge Friends: Burgess, Maclean, Philby, Blunt, and Cairncross by Their KGB Controller&quot;. Since Rothschild had died prior to the publication of the Perry book, the family was unable to start a libel action.

In a 1991 interview with &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot;, Cairncross explained how he had forwarded information to Moscow during WWII and boasted that it &quot;helped the Soviets to win that battle (the Battle of Kursk) against the Germans&quot;. Cairncross did not view himself as one of the Cambridge Five, insisting that the information he sent to Moscow was not harmful to Britain and that he had remained loyal to his homeland. Unlike many other spies, he was never charged with passing information to Moscow.

===Attempted coverup===
For unknown reasons, Prime Minister Alec Douglas-Home was not advised of Anthony Blunt&#x27;s spying, although the Queen and Home Secretary Henry Brooke were informed. It was only in November 1979 that then-PM Margaret Thatcher formally advised Parliament of Blunt&#x27;s treachery and the immunity deal that had been arranged 15 years earlier.

A 2015 article in &quot;The Guardian&quot; discussed &quot;400 top-secret documents which have been released at the National Archives&quot; and indicated that MI5 and MI6 had worked diligently to prevent information about the five from being disclosed, &quot;to the British public and even to the US government&quot;. A 2016 review of a new book about Burgess added that &quot;more than 20% of files relating to the spies, most of whom defected more than 50 years ago, remain closed&quot;. In conclusion, the review stated that &quot;the Foreign Office, MI6 and MI5 all have an interest in covering up, to protect themselves from huge embarrassment&quot; and that &quot;more taxpayers&#x27; money is spent by Whitehall officials in the futile attempt to keep the files under lock and key for ever&quot;.

Under the 30-year rule, the 400 documents should have been made available years earlier. It was particularly surprising that 20 per cent of the information was redacted or not released. A news item at the time stated that &quot;it is clear the full story of the Cambridge Spies has not yet emerged&quot;. A summary of the documents indicated that they showed that &quot;inaction and incompetence on the part of the authorities enabled Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean to make their escape to Moscow&quot;.

Additional secret files were finally released to the National Archives in 2020. They indicated that the government had intentionally conducted a campaign to keep Kim Philby&#x27;s spying confidential &quot;to minimise political embarrassment&quot; and prevented the publication of his memoirs according to a report by &quot;The Guardian&quot;. Nonetheless, the information was publicized in 1967 when Philby granted an interview to journalist Murray Sayle of &quot;The Times&quot;. Philby confirmed that he had worked for the KGB and that &quot;his purpose in life was to destroy imperialism&quot;. This revelation raised concerns that Blunt&#x27;s spying would also be revealed to the public.

===Alleged additional members===
Blunt and Burgess were both members of the University Pitt Club as well as the Cambridge Apostles, exclusive secret societies at Cambridge University. Other Apostles have been suspected of having spied for the Soviets.

Some researchers believe the spy ring had more than five, or different, members. Several of the following have been alleged to be possible Soviet spies:
* Roger Hollis, the Director-General of MI5 from 1956 to 1965, was accused of being the (then) Fifth Man by his subordinate Peter Wright in his notorious tell-all autobiography &quot;Spycatcher&quot; in 1987, 14 years after Hollis&#x27;s death. Journalist Chapman Pincher had made the same allegation in 1981. These allegations have been dismissed by some other journalists and historians, although the issue remains debated and has not been settled.
*Baron Rothschild was named by Roland Perry in his book &quot;The Fifth Man&quot;. According to &quot;Spycatcher&quot;, Rothschild had been friendly with Burgess as an undergraduate, and had originally owned the lease on a house off Welbeck Street, No. 5 Bentinck Street, where Blunt and Burgess both lived during the war. This was supposedly confirmed by Yuri Modin, the alleged controller of the five, who—according to Perry—had claimed Cairncross was never part of the group. However, in reviewing Perry&#x27;s book, commentator Sheila Kerr pointed out that as soon as the book came out, Modin denied Perry&#x27;s version of their discussions (having already stated that the fifth man was Cairncross), and concluded that &quot;Perry&#x27;s case against Rothschild is unconvincing because of dubious sources and slack methods&quot;.
* Michael Straight was a suspected Cambridge Apostle and self-confessed spy.
* Leonard Henry (Leo) Long was accused by Blunt in 1964. Blunt claimed to have recruited Long to the Communist cause while Blunt was his tutor at Cambridge. Long served as an intelligence officer with MI14 from 1940 to 1945, and later with the British element of the Allied Control Commission in Occupied Germany from 1945 to 1952. Long passed analyses but not original material relating to the Eastern Front to Blunt. Blunt also was associated with other Cambridge persons subsequently involved in espionage (Michael Straight, Peter Ashby, Brian Simon) but they are generally considered as minor figures as compared to the &quot;Cambridge Five&quot;.
* Guy Liddell was an MI5 officer and nearly rose to become director of the service but was passed over because of rumours he was a double agent; he took early retirement from MI5 in 1953 after he was investigated for his personal links to Philby. He was accused of having been the &quot;fifth man&quot; by Goronwy Rees as part of Rees&#x27; confession in 1979. The academic consensus is that he was naïve in his friendships rather than a spy.
* Andrew Gow: in his memoirs published in 2012, Brian Sewell suggested that Gow was the &quot;fifth man&quot; and spymaster of the group. This suggestion was subsequently refuted by Anthony Powell.
* Wilfrid Basil Mann: Mann had been accused on several occasions of being the &quot;fifth man&quot;, based on rumoured former work at the Embassy and the resemblance between his name and the &quot;Basil&quot; of Boyle&#x27;s codename. In his memoirs, Mann argued using contemporary correspondence, publications, and verified passport entries that he was incapable of having worked with Donald Maclean in the British Embassy. As part of his hiring at the Bureau of Standards, Mann underwent intense security screening and received a top-level &quot;Q&quot; clearance from the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission.

<text>In mathematics, an automorphic number (sometimes referred to as a circular number) is a natural number in a given number base formula_1 whose square &quot;ends&quot; in the same digits as the number itself.

==Definition and properties==
Given a number base formula_1, a natural number formula_3 with formula_4 digits is an automorphic number if formula_3 is a fixed point of the polynomial function formula_6 over formula_7, the ring of integers modulo formula_8. As the inverse limit of formula_7 is formula_10, the ring of formula_1-adic integers, automorphic numbers are used to find the numerical representations of the fixed points of formula_6 over formula_10. 

For example, with formula_14, there are four 10-adic fixed points of formula_6, the last 10 digits of which are:
: formula_16
: formula_17
: formula_18 
: formula_19 
Thus, the automorphic numbers in base 10 are 0, 1, 5, 6, 25, 76, 376, 625, 9376, 90625, 109376, 890625, 2890625, 7109376, 12890625, 87109376, 212890625, 787109376, 1787109376, 8212890625, 18212890625, 81787109376, 918212890625, 9918212890625, 40081787109376, 59918212890625, ... .

A fixed point of formula_20 is a zero of the function formula_21. In the ring of integers modulo formula_1, there are formula_23 zeroes to formula_24, where the prime omega function formula_25 is the number of distinct prime factors in formula_1. An element formula_27 in formula_28 is a zero of formula_24 if and only if formula_30 or formula_31 for all formula_32. Since there are two possible values in formula_33, and there are formula_25 such formula_32, there are formula_23 zeroes of formula_24, and thus there are formula_23 fixed points of formula_6. According to Hensel&#x27;s lemma, if there are formula_4 zeroes or fixed points of a polynomial function modulo formula_1, then there are formula_4 corresponding zeroes or fixed points of the same function modulo any power of formula_1, and this remains true in the inverse limit. Thus, in any given base formula_1 there are formula_23 formula_1-adic fixed points of formula_6.

As 0 is always a zero-divisor, 0 and 1 are always fixed points of formula_6, and 0 and 1 are automorphic numbers in every base. These solutions are called trivial automorphic numbers. If formula_1 is a prime power, then the ring of formula_1-adic numbers has no zero-divisors other than 0, so the only fixed points of formula_6 are 0 and 1. As a result, nontrivial automorphic numbers, those other than 0 and 1, only exist when the base formula_1 has at least two distinct prime factors. 

===Automorphic numbers in base &quot;b&quot;===
All formula_1-adic numbers are represented in base formula_1, using A−Z to represent digit values 10 to 35.
==Extensions==
Automorphic numbers can be extended to any such polynomial function of degree formula_3 formula_56 with &quot;b&quot;-adic coefficients formula_57. These generalised automorphic numbers form a tree.

===&quot;a&quot;-automorphic numbers===
An formula_58-automorphic number occurs when the polynomial function is formula_59 

For example, with formula_14 and formula_61, as there are two fixed points for formula_62 in formula_63 (formula_64 and formula_65), according to Hensel&#x27;s lemma there are two 10-adic fixed points for formula_62, 
: formula_16
: formula_68
so the 2-automorphic numbers in base 10 are 0, 8, 88, 688, 4688...

===Trimorphic numbers===
A trimorphic number or spherical number occurs when the polynomial function is formula_69. All automorphic numbers are trimorphic. The terms &quot;circular&quot; and &quot;spherical&quot; were formerly used for the slightly different case of a number whose powers all have the same last digit as the number itself.

For base formula_14, the trimorphic numbers are:
:0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 24, 25, 49, 51, 75, 76, 99, 125, 249, 251, 375, 376, 499, 501, 624, 625, 749, 751, 875, 999, 1249, 3751, 4375, 4999, 5001, 5625, 6249, 8751, 9375, 9376, 9999, ... 

For base formula_71, the trimorphic numbers are: 
:0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, B, 15, 47, 53, 54, 5B, 61, 68, 69, 75, A7, B3, BB, 115, 253, 368, 369, 4A7, 5BB, 601, 715, 853, 854, 969, AA7, BBB, 14A7, 2369, 3853, 3854, 4715, 5BBB, 6001, 74A7, 8368, 8369, 9853, A715, BBBB, ...

==Programming example==

def hensels_lemma(polynomial_function, base: int, power: int) -&gt; list[int]:
 &quot;&quot;&quot;Hensel&#x27;s lemma.&quot;&quot;&quot;
 if power == 0:
 return [0]
 if power &gt; 0:
 roots = hensels_lemma(polynomial_function, base, power - 1)
 new_roots = []
 for root in roots:
 for i in range(0, base):
 new_i = i * base ** (power - 1) + root
 new_root = polynomial_function(new_i) % pow(base, power)
 if new_root == 0:
 new_roots.append(new_i)
 return new_roots

base = 10
digits = 10

def automorphic_polynomial(x: int) -&gt; int:
 return x ** 2 - x

for i in range(1, digits + 1):
 print(hensels_lemma(automorphic_polynomial, base, i))

<text>Eutyches (; c. 380c. 456) or Eutyches of Constantinople was a presbyter and archimandrite at Constantinople. He first came to notice in 431 at the First Council of Ephesus, for his vehement opposition to the teachings of Nestorius. At the 448 Synod of Constantinople and the 451 Council of Chalcedon, Eutyches was condemned for having adopted an equally extreme, although opposite view. He himself, however, would reject this interpretation of his thought.

==Life==
Eutyches was an archimandrite of a monastery outside the walls of Constantinople, where he ruled over 300 monks. He was much respected and was godfather to Chrysaphius, an influential eunuch at the court of Theodosius II.

==Controversy==
The patriarch of Constantinople, Nestorius, having asserted that Mary ought not to be referred to as the &quot;Mother of God&quot; (&quot;Theotokos&quot; in Greek, literally &quot;God-bearer&quot;), was denounced as a heretic; in combating this assertion of Patriarch Nestorius, Eutyches was claimed to have declared that Christ was &quot;a fusion of human and divine elements&quot;, causing his own denunciation as a heretic seventeen years after the First Council of Ephesus at the 448 AD Synod of Constantinople, and later again in 451 at the Council of Chalcedon.

According to Nestorius, all the human experiences and attributes of Christ are to be assigned to &#x27;the man&#x27;, as a personal subject distinct from God the Word, though united to God the Word from the moment of conception. The fathers of the Synod of Constantinople argued that in opposition to this Eutyches had inverted the assertion to the opposite extreme, asserting that human nature and divine nature were combined into the single nature of Christ without any alteration, absorption or confusion: that of the incarnate Word. Although this accorded with the later teaching of Cyril of Alexandria, Eutyches was accused of having gone beyond Cyril in denying that Christ was &quot;consubstantial with us men&quot;, by which he did not intend to deny Christ&#x27;s full manhood, but to stress His uniqueness.

In the surviving acts of the 448 Synod in which Eutyches presents his own defence, however, he himself rejects this understanding of his thought, and the doctrine that became known as &quot;Eutychianism&quot; is presented only by hostile parties as an interpretation of the implications of his thinking. In an overview of the proceedings against Eutyches, which they view as a type of imperial show trial directed against Cyril&#x27;s radical supporters, the historians Patrick T. R. Gray and George A. Bevan argue that &quot;what [Eutyches] himself said gives us no reason to see him as having been anything other than a vigorous champion of a late Cyrillian position&quot;, that is, miaphysitism.

==Career==
Eutyches denied that Christ&#x27;s humanity was limited or incomplete, a view that some thought similar to the Alexandrine doctrine. In any event, the energy and imprudence with which Eutyches asserted his opinions led to his being misunderstood. He was accused of heresy by Domnus II of Antioch and Eusebius, bishop of Dorylaeum at a synod presided over by Flavian at Constantinople in 448. His explanations deemed unsatisfactory, the council deposed him from his priestly office and excommunicated him.

In 449, however, the Second Council of Ephesus was convened by Dioscorus of Alexandria, who was under the impression that Eutyches had renounced Monophysitism. Overawed by the presence of a large number of Egyptian monks, the council not only reinstated Eutyches to his office but also deposed Eusebius, Domnus, and Flavian, his chief opponents. The council&#x27;s judgment conflicted with the opinion of the bishop of Rome, Leo, who, departing from the policy of his predecessor Celestine, had written very strongly to Flavian in support of the doctrine of the two natures and one person.

Meanwhile, the emperor Theodosius II died. His successor, Marcian, married Theodosius&#x27;s sister, Pulcheria. In October 451, Marcian and Pulcheria summoned a council (the fourth ecumenical) which met at Chalcedon, which Dioscorus attended and at which he was condemned. There the synod of Ephesus was called a &quot;robber synod,&quot; at which, it was said, Dioscorus had threatened the bishops with death if they did not agree with him. That previous synod&#x27;s proceedings were annulled and, in accordance with the more miaphysite strand in the teaching of Cyril of Alexandria, it was declared that the two natures are united in Christ (without any alteration, absorption or confusion) and &#x27;come together to form one person and one hypostasis.&#x27; Eutyches died in exile, but of his later life nothing is known.

Those who did not approve the Chalcedonian Council were later accused of being &quot;Monophysites&quot; and are nowadays known as &quot;Oriental Orthodox,&quot; a phrase that today applies to churches such as the Coptic Church, the Armenian Orthodox Church, and the Syrian Orthodox Church. They were wrongfully accused of agreeing with Eutyches about &quot;one nature&quot; in Christ and of rejecting Christ&#x27;s dual consubstantiality (with the Father and with us men); however, Oriental Orthodox churches prefer to be called &quot;Miaphysites&quot; and are against the teachings of Eutyches. This was confirmed in May 1973 when the late Coptic pope, Shenouda III, visited Rome and penned a Christological statement with Pope Paul VI.

Eutyches&#x27;s memory was kept alive by the Chalcedonians such as Leo I, who used the term &#x27;Eutychian&#x27; as a pejorative description of the non-Chalcedonians who in their turn accused the Chalcedonians of being &#x27;Nestorians&#x27;.

<text>Flavian of Constantinople (; , &quot;Phlabianos&quot;; 11 August 449), sometimes &quot;Flavian I&quot;, was Archbishop of Constantinople from 446 to 449. He is venerated as a saint and martyr by the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church.

== Consecration as archbishop and imperial dispute ==
Flavian was a presbyter and the guardian of the sacred vessels of the great Church of Constantinople and, according to Nikephoros Kallistos Xanthopoulos, was reputed to lead a saintly life, when he was chosen to succeed Proclus of Constantinople as Archbishop of Constantinople.

During his consecration, Roman Emperor Theodosius II was staying at Chalcedon. His eunuch Chrysaphius attempted to extort a present of gold to the Emperor but as he was unsuccessful, he began to plot against the new archbishop by supporting the archimandrite Eutyches in his dispute with Flavian.

== Home Synod of Constantinople ==
Flavian presided at a council of forty bishops at Constantinople on 8 November 448, to resolve a dispute between the metropolitan bishop of Sardis and two bishops of his province. Eusebius of Dorylaeum, bishop of Dorylaeum, presented an indictment against Eutyches. The speech of Flavian remains, concluding with this appeal to the bishop of Dorylaeum: &quot;Let your reverence condescend to visit him and argue with him about the true faith, and if he shall be found in very truth to err, then he shall be called to our holy assembly and shall answer for himself&quot;. Eventually the synod deposed Eutyches.

== Second Council of Ephesus ==
However, Eutyches protested against this verdict and received the support of Pope Dioscorus I of Alexandria, and he fled to Alexandria. The Emperor Theodosius II, already angered by Flavian&#x27;s refusal to pay him the customary bribe, was persuaded by the eunuch Chrysaphius to convoke another Council to Ephesus. At this council, which assembled on 8 August 449, Eutyches was declared an orthodox teacher and reinstated, while Flavian was anathematised, deposed, and ordered into exile.

== Death and Martyrdom ==
At the previously mentioned second Council of Ephesus at the crux of the council the various leaders opposed to Eutyches&#x27; Monophysitism were variously assaulted. Once Flavian&#x27;s condemnation was read, some of his supporters (namely bishops Onesiphorus of Iconium, Marinianus of Synnada, Nunechius of Laodicea and others) rushed to appeal to Dioscorus, who summoned the counts Helpidius and Eulogius to restore order. They entered the church, led by the proconsul Proclus and followed by soldiers and a mob. Flavian feared for his life and escaped to the sacristry, where he was under guard. He wrote a letter to Pope Leo, which papal legate and future Pope Hilarius conveyed to Rome after escaping Ephesus with much difficulty. Flavian, however, was then beaten, kicked, and trampled over by impudent monks led by a certain Barsauma. He succumbed to his injuries after three days at Epipus in Lydia, and was buried obscurely.

The exact circumstances of Flavian&#x27;s death, and the extent of Dioscorus&#x27; personal responsibility for it, are unclear and remain controversial in Eastern-Oriental Orthodox dialogue. Flavian&#x27;s lettter to Leo says that soldiers &quot;with unsheathed swords&quot; threatened the bishops, and that a crowd of soldiers surrounded him and prevented him from taking sanctuary in the altar, but he does not mention any physical assault. At the Council of Chalcedon two years later, eyewitnesses gave several conflicting accounts. One deacon, Ischyrion, accused Dioscorus of ordering his syncelli (personal clerics) to murder people at Ephesus and even promoting them for the killings. Basil of Seleucia claimed &quot;Armed soldiers burst into the church, and there were arrayed Barsauma and his monks, parabalani, and a great miscellaneous mob&quot; and that Dioscorus controlled the bishops there using &quot;the threats of the mob&quot;. According to Diogenes of Cyzicus, a group of Barsauma&#x27;s monks beat up Flavian while Barsauma cried &quot;Strike him dead!&quot;. Finally, some bishops testified that Dioscorus&#x27; soldiers killed Flavian with clubs and swords. However, Richard Price and Michael Gaddis question the impartiality of these accounts, noting that these bishops had to place all blame for Flavian&#x27;s death on Dioscorus to exculpate themselves.

Additional, possibly embellished details about Flavian&#x27;s death only appear in later authors. The earliest source on Flavian&#x27;s death, Nestorius, describes how Flavian was beaten at Ephesus, though not to death, and then banished to his home city of Hypaepa. However, the soldiers rushed him to his place of exile (with murderous intent, according to Nestorius), so that Flavian&#x27;s injuries combined with the fatigue of the journey led to his death after four days. Prosper of Aquitaine, another contemporary, affirms that Flavian was killed by the soldiers taking him to his place of banishment. In a disputed letter to Theodoret dated 11 June 453, Pope Leo blamed Dioscorus in a general sense for Flavian&#x27;s death. Liberatus of Carthage relates that Flavian suffered blows and died as a result. According to Evagrius Scholasticus, Eusebius of Dorylaeum complained at the council that Dioscorus himself, along with Barsauma&#x27;s monks, beat and kicked Flavian. Theophanes the Confessor, writing three centuries after the event, mentions that Dioscorus personally struck Flavian &quot;both with hands and feet&quot;. The detail of Flavian clutching the altar as he was beaten is also a later invention.

== Aftermath ==
Pope Leo I, whose legates had been ignored at the council, protested, first calling the council a &quot;robber synod&quot;, and declared its decisions void.

After Theodosius II died in 450, his sister Pulcheria returned to power, marrying the officer Marcian, who became Emperor. The new Imperial couple had Flavian&#x27;s remains brought to Constantinople in a way that, in the words of a chronicler, more resembled &quot;a triumph... than a funeral procession&quot;. The Council of Chalcedon, called in 451, condemned Eutyches, confirmed Pope Leo&#x27;s &quot;Tome&quot; (letter 28) and canonised Flavian as a martyr.

In the Catholic Church St. Flavian is commemorated on 18 February, the date assigned to him in the Roman Martyrology. Flavian of Ricina is sometimes identified with him.

<text>Vereniging Martijn (; &quot;Martijn Association&quot;; stylized as MARTIJN) was a Dutch association that advocated the societal acceptance of pedophilia and legalization of sexual relationships between adults and children.

==Establishment==
The organization began in 1984. It claimed to fight for &quot;the social and societal acceptance of child-adult relationships&quot;, emphasising what they called the &quot;consent of both child and adult&quot; and the &quot;freedom for the child to withdraw from the relationship&quot;. It claimed to be in favour of &quot;objective, scientifically verifiable truth and against political terror and discrimination.&quot;

==&quot;OK Magazine&quot;==
From 1986 until 2006, the group published &quot;OK Magazine&quot;, available only through the mail and not in shops, featuring essays, letters, interviews and photographs of scantily clad or naked children, mostly boys.

==Opposition==

MARTIJN was expelled from the International Lesbian and Gay Association in 1994. The group was seen as &quot;widely reviled&quot; though Dutch prosecutors initially formed the view that it could not be prosecuted.

In 2003, Vereniging MARTIJN faced opposition by the &quot;Actiecomité Stop MARTIJN&quot; (Action Committee Stop MARTIJN), which organized demonstrations against them. Formed and led by Michiel Smit of the New Right, Florens van der Kooi of the NNP, as well as Inge Bleecke of &quot;Moeders tegen Pedofilie&quot; (Mothers against Pedophilia), the committee was labelled as extreme right by their opponents.

==Photographs of Princess Amalia==
The organization was in the news in October 2007 when it was learned that photographs of Princess Catharina-Amalia, daughter of Willem-Alexander, Prince of Orange and his wife Princess Maxima, were on display on the website&#x27;s forum. The Prince went to court to request a €50,000 fine and the removal of the photos from the website. The court agreed that the photos must be removed, and imposed a fine of €5,000 to be paid every time photos of children of the royal family are placed on the site again. The organisation had to pay €1,235 in costs.

==Police investigations==

The home of the organization&#x27;s president, Ad van den Berg, was raided by police in October 2010; downloads of illegal material had been traced back to Van den Berg&#x27;s internet connection. It was announced in March 2011 that large quantities of child pornography were found among the confiscated material, and even more material, including computers, was confiscated when Van den Berg was arrested on 29 March. In October 2018 he was convicted of possession of child pornography, and sentenced to three years imprisonment. 

Suspects in the Amsterdam sex case, an investigation into the abuse of tens of children in Amsterdam kindergartens, were members of MARTIJN.

==Priests&#x27; involvement==
On 20 May 2011, Herman Spronck, the head of the Dutch arm of the Salesian Catholic order, confirmed to RTL Nieuws that a priest under him had been on the board of MARTIJN until the Van den Berg raids. He added, &quot;Of course we reject this and distance ourselves from this personal initiative.&quot; RTL obtained interviews both with Spronck and the priest (73-year-old &quot;Father Van B.&quot;) in which the two defended adult-child sex as not always damaging. The priest concerned had prior convictions for child sexual abuse. The provincial for the Salesians, Jos Claes, opened disciplinary procedures against Spronck.

== Disbandment ==
On 18 June 2011, the Ministry of Security and Justice announced that the association&#x27;s activities were not illegal. Crimes committed by its members could not be attributed to the association and as such the organisation could not be prosecuted, banned or disbanded.

On 27 June 2012, a Dutch court in Assen ruled that the group was illegal and ordered the group to cease activities and disband immediately. The judge stated that the group&#x27;s actions and statements regarding sexual contact between adults and children were in conflict with the accepted norms and values of Dutch society. In his statement, the judge emphasised the overriding need to protect children. However, in April 2013, a higher court overturned this decision, upholding the Martijn club&#x27;s right to freedom of association. On 18 April 2014, the Supreme Court overturned the acquittal and reinstated the trial judge&#x27;s order. In 2015, an appeal by the association to the European Court for Human Rights (ECHR) was rejected.

<text>Stagecoach South Western Trains Limited, trading as South West Trains (SWT), was an English train operating company owned by Stagecoach, which operated the South Western franchise between February 1996 and August 2017.

SWT operated the majority of commuter services from its Central London terminus at London Waterloo to South West London and was the key operator for outer suburban and regional services in the counties of Surrey, Hampshire and Dorset. It also provided regional services in Devon, Somerset, Berkshire, Wiltshire and on the Isle of Wight through its Island Line subsidiary. Unlike the majority of franchises, SWT operated without subsidies, being a profitable concern due to the high number of commuters that regularly used its services.

The area of operation was the former South Western division of Network SouthEast, and was also roughly that of the pre-1923 London &amp; South Western Railway (excluding everything west of Exeter). As part of the privatisation of British Rail, SWT was taken over by Stagecoach. In 2004, the franchise was retained by Stagecoach when re-tendered. In 2007, the franchise was merged with the Island Line franchise to form a newly extended South Western franchise, which was won by Stagecoach. When next tendered, the franchise was awarded to South Western Railway which took over the franchise on 20 August 2017.

==History==
===Origins===
As a consequence of the privatisation of British Rail during the mid 1990s, railway operations were segmented into various franchises, one of which being the South Western franchise. These franchises were awarded to various privately owned companies following an evaluation of competitive bids. During 1995, it was announced that the Director of Passenger Rail Franchising had awarded the South West Trains franchise to the Scottish transport group Stagecoach. Operations commenced on 4 February 1996, with South West Trains&#x27; first train, the 05:10 Twickenham to London Waterloo; it was the first privatised scheduled train to operate for 48 years.

In April 2001, the Strategic Rail Authority awarded Stagecoach a new franchise for the region, its bid having been judged to be superior to those from its rivals, FirstGroup / NedRailways and Sea Containers. The 2001 franchises awarded were (as promulgated) to run for twenty years; however, only one year later, the Strategic Rail Authority decided to reduce the duration of franchises, thus South West Trains was awarded a three-year franchise starting on 1 February 2004. Shortly following this award, SWT placed a substantial order for new rolling stock for the network, it was described as being the largest such order in British history.

During the early days of its franchise, SWT gained notoriety for enacting severe cuts to its services, which were typically attributed to the shortage of drivers; the company sought to remedy this by seeking to hire additional drivers. SWT also implemented significant improvements upon the network, including replacing much of the inherited British Rail-era rolling stock, along with the refurbishment of most stations, which included increasing their accessibility to disabled passengers. There was also an emphasis on the improving the customer experience, such as better access to service information. During the early 2000s, improvements included the introduction of new rail services and the reopening of Chandler&#x27;s Ford station in Hampshire.

===Changes===
From May 2004, a smoking ban on all SWT services was introduced; this move, which came partly in response to a fire caused by a cigarette left next to an under-seat heater during the previous year that raised safety concerns, also pre-empting the public smoking ban that was introduced two years later. Additional staff were deployed onboard trains to help enforce the change. At the time, most other commuter services had already banned smoking, and the measure was claimed by the Evening Standard to be popular with the majority of the travelling public.

On 12 December 2004, the company completely recast its timetable, the first occasion that such an exercise had been performed in the South West region since 1967. This was reportedly motivated by ambitions to bring service provision into line with changing demand and to take into account the different characteristics of modern rolling stock. Within a year, the new timetable had delivered an increase in reliability and punctuality across the network, measured as a 12% improvement in the operator&#x27;s Public Performance Measure. Further major changes to the timetable followed in subsequent years, including the restoration of services between Yeovil and Yeovil Pen Mill that had been withdrawn under the Beeching cuts.

During December 2005, the Department for Transport (DfT) announced that Arriva, FirstGroup, MTR/Sea Containers, National Express and Stagecoach had been shortlisted to tender for the new South Western franchise, which combined the South West Trains and Island Line Trains franchises; National Express later withdrew. In September 2006, the DfT awarded the franchise to Stagecoach, the new franchise starting on 4 February 2007, for a period of ten years.

Throughout the operation of the franchise, passenger numbers grew year on year, along with rapid spikes in numbers occurring in some years. While many franchises required government funding to sustain their services, SWT operated without any subsidies and was a profitable venture. This outcome was largely on account of the high proportion of commuters that made frequent use of its services. One of the franchise&#x27;s major ongoing concerns was the overcrowding that occurred on some services, particularly around rush hour, thus SWT&#x27;s management paid considerable attention to increasing capacity when feasible.

Major measures performed by SWT to expand the network&#x27;s capacity included improvement works at London Waterloo station and the procurement of new rolling stock. Christian Roth, SWT&#x27;s engineering director, claimed in 2015 that the firm was in the process of delivering similar capacity improvements to the Thameslink programme at a tenth of the cost and a quarter of the time. While some rival companies chose to pursue driver-only operated trains, eliminating the necessity of a guard, SWT senior manager Brian Souter promised to keep a guard on every service; one consequence of this agreement was strong relations between the company and the trade unions.

Further measures were also proposed by SWT; Tim Shoveller, the company&#x27;s managing director, periodically spoke out on his desire to eventually introduce double-decker trains to serve its busiest commuter routes. While typically viewed as an effective means of increasing capacity, such ambitions were complicated by multiple factors, the principal of which that there were no double-deck trains in operation that were believed to be suitable for SWT&#x27;s needs, thus likely necessitating the development of an original design. Procuring a small fleet of bespoke rolling stock would certainly incur a steep price rise over conventional rolling stock, while handling the increased dwell times typically necessary when operating double-deck trains would also adversely impact the timetable; finally, no such rolling stock could be operated until the completion of track lowering across substantial portions of the network, particularly around bridges and tunnels, for sufficient headroom to be achieved.

Between 2012 and 2015, Stagecoach partnered with the British railway infrastructure owner Network Rail to jointly operate London Waterloo via a single management team that operated both tracks and trains in and around the station from a on-site joint control room. At the time, the partnership was hailed as an advancement for rail operations, However, the arrangement was dissolved in 2015 without any official explanation, although anonymous insiders claimed the cause to be Network Rail&#x27;s reluctance to devolve power over its centralised infrastructure to individual routes, while Stagecoach desired local decisions to be made in partnership.

===Demise===
In March 2013, the Secretary of State for Transport announced the DfT was in talks with Stagecoach to extend the franchise until April 2019. At one point, it seemed certain that the franchise would be renewed, information to that effect having been included on the Government&#x27;s published Rail Franchise Schedule in October 2014. However, in July 2015, Stagecoach confirmed that talks had failed and the franchise would be relet. This outcome was viewed by several industry commentators as being unexpected and inconvenient in its timing; the periodical &quot;Rail&quot; speculated that Stagecoach&#x27;s rejection had been largely due to government officials feeling that the state was not receiving a sufficiently large share of the profits being generated.

Stagecoach and a FirstGroup / MTR Corporation joint venture were shortlisted on 4 February 2016 to bid for the new franchise. On 27 March 2017, the franchise was awarded to South Western Railway, in spite of concerns that it would result in a single company holding a monopoly on services between London and the West of England, Dorset and Somerset, due to FirstGroup also operating the Greater Western franchise in those regions.

==Services==
South West Trains was the key operator for western Surrey, Hampshire and Dorset, and also served Berkshire, Wiltshire, Somerset and Devon. In Greater London, it operated all National Rail services (other than London Overground) in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames and the London Boroughs of Richmond-upon-Thames and Hounslow, and also served the London Boroughs of Merton, Wandsworth and Lambeth.

Most SWT services ran on electrified lines using the 750 V DC third-rail system. A diesel fleet was used for services on the West of England line to Salisbury, Exeter and Bristol, using the unelectrified track beyond Worting Junction just west of Basingstoke, and for Salisbury to Southampton via Romsey services which also served Eastleigh. By 2015, SWT was reportedly operating roughly 1,600 train services each day and managing in excess of 200 stations.

From Waterloo, SWT&#x27;s London terminus, long-distance trains ran to southern England, including the major coastal population centres of Portsmouth, Southampton, Bournemouth, Poole and Weymouth. There were also trains to Reading, Exeter and Bristol, but these were not the principal fast services from London to those cities, which are operated from by Great Western Railway. The majority of its passengers were on suburban commuter lines in inner and south-west London, Surrey, east Berkshire, and north-east Hampshire.

After privatisation in 1996, the network changed considerably, no longer serving West Croydon, Sutton, &#x27;Coastway&#x27; stations between Chichester and Brighton, or the Reading to Basingstoke line. Services to Bristol (introduced in 2004 to replace withdrawn Arriva Trains Wales services), Mottisfont and Dunbridge and Dean were introduced after the start of the franchise. Its longstanding services beyond Exeter to Paignton, Plymouth and Penzance, which ran in competition with First Great Western and its predecessors, ceased in December 2009 so as to release stock for the hourly Waterloo to Exeter service.

As with most rail companies, non-folding bicycles were banned from peak-time trains to and from London. However, these restrictions applied only to cyclists boarding or alighting in the area bounded by Hook, Alton, Guildford, Reading and Dorking. The aim was to maximise available passenger space on the most crowded trains.

South West Trains had Quiet Zones, similar to the Quiet Coaches on trains operated by certain other Train Operating Companies. Quiet Zones were available on most outer-suburban services and on some express services and are indicated by notices in the windows and signs on the doors. Passengers in these zones were requested not to use mobile phones to take calls or play music out loud.

===Routes===
South West Trains operated suburban and long-distance trains. Main destinations included: London Waterloo, Clapham Junction, , Richmond, Twickenham, Hounslow, Ascot, Staines, Reading, Windsor &amp; Eton Riverside, Kingston, Raynes Park, Motspur Park, New Malden, Chessington South, Surbiton, Leatherhead, Weybridge, Dorking, Effingham Junction, Woking, Guildford, Aldershot, Alton, Farnborough Main, Fleet, Basingstoke, Haslemere, Andover, Winchester, Eastleigh, Southampton Central, Romsey, Salisbury, Fareham, Portsmouth &amp; Southsea, Brockenhurst, Portsmouth Harbour, Bournemouth, Westbury, Bristol Temple Meads, Weymouth, Yeovil Junction and Exeter St Davids.

===Main lines===


The seven main lines operated by SWT were:
* The South West Main Line (SWML) to Southampton Central, Bournemouth and Weymouth. 2 trains an hour through to Weymouth (1 fast and 1 semi-fast) and 1 train an hour to Poole (stopping) Mondays-Saturdays, with Sunday Bournemouth services extended to Poole.
* The Portsmouth Direct line via Guildford and Haslemere: leaves the main line at Woking. 4 trains per hour to Guildford, then 1 semi-fast service and 1 stopping service to Haslemere. The semi-fast service continued as a stopping service to Portsmouth. The fast services ran approximately half-hourly Mondays-Saturdays, 2 trains per hour (1 fast, 1 stopping from Guildford) on Sundays.
* The West of England Main Line to Salisbury, Yeovil Junction and : leaves the main line at Basingstoke.
* Wessex Main Line (part): Salisbury to Bristol Temple Meads. This service originated from London Waterloo and divides at Salisbury.
* Heart of Wessex Line (part): Yeovil Junction to Yeovil Pen Mill / Frome. This service originates from London Waterloo and divides at Yeovil Junction.
* London Waterloo to Portsmouth Harbour via Basingstoke and Eastleigh. Hourly service off-peak Mondays-Saturdays, merges with the Poole train on Sundays.
* London Waterloo to Reading via Staines-upon-Thames, Ascot and .

===Suburban services===
Suburban services diverged from the above routes. Taken in order westwards from Waterloo, travelling down the SWML, they are:
* Waterloo–Reading line: from Clapham Junction
** The Hounslow Loop line from Barnes to Whitton or Feltham
** The Windsor branch from Staines-upon-Thames
** The Chertsey loop line from Virginia Water to Weybridge
** The Ascot to Guildford line via Aldershot
* The Mole Valley Line, from Raynes Park to Dorking via Epsom
** The Chessington branch from Motspur Park
** The branch to Guildford from Leatherhead
* The Kingston loop line, from New Malden (Main Line) to Twickenham (Reading Line)
** The Shepperton branch from Teddington; normally, these services run via New Malden, some peak services run via Twickenham
* The New Guildford line, to Guildford via Cobham from Surbiton (travellers from Guildford to London can also travel via the main line through Woking)
* The Hampton Court branch, also from Surbiton
* The Alton branch, from Brookwood also serves the Mid Hants Railway, a heritage line

===Other services===
* Southampton local lines: Salisbury to Romsey via Southampton Central and Chandler&#x27;s Ford (previously this service ran to Totton)
* Lymington branch line (Brockenhurst to Lymington Pier)
*Island Line, Isle of Wight, Ryde Pier Head to Shanklin
* Southampton Central to Portsmouth &amp; Southsea

==Ticketing==
===Travelcards===
London Travelcards were available and widely used for journeys into Greater London beyond any of the South West Trains stations. They were valid on London Buses, Tramlink, Docklands Light Railway, London Underground and national rail services within the London travelcard area. All tickets and (London) Travelcards were available on weekly, monthly and annual bases (such tickets are traditionally known as season tickets), a pre-requisite for which is a passport-sized photograph for a booking hall to issue a nationally valid railcard. All ticket pricing structures are regulated by the Office of Rail &amp; Road.

Daily tickets fell into four categories: Peak &#x27;Anytime&#x27;, Off Peak, Super Off Peak and Advance (pre-booked, long distance). These were broken down into whether the user requires a &quot;Single&quot;, &quot;Return&quot; (valid for one calendar month) or a &quot;Day Return.&quot;

===Smartcards===
Oyster pay-as-you-go could be used on services within Greater London. Oyster cards holding season tickets were accepted within the London Travelcard area, in the same way as normal paper Travelcards and season tickets.

In November 2010, the DfT announced that passengers would be able to top up Oyster cards at all stations operated by South West Trains in the London Travelcard area from May 2011. SWT was the last rail company franchise to offer this facility (except at Wimbledon and Richmond stations) for passengers using suburban rail services within the London Travelcard area.

The smartcard scheme for tickets on the national rail system was extended in early 2010 to cover the lines from Weymouth to Basingstoke and from Staines to Wokingham, and on the Isle of Wight, in addition to the current trial area between Staines and Windsor. It was also announced that SWT proposed to reduce operating hours at 24 of its ticket offices.

===Penalty fares===
South West Trains issued penalty fares for passengers travelling by train without a valid ticket. However, the company had planned to install at least one self-service ticket machine at each of its served stations in the bid to stop fare evasion. In 2009, ticket gates were installed at Waterloo to improve revenue protection.

===Megatrain===

Stagecoach, SWT&#x27;s parent company, sold seats on some off-peak services under the Megatrain brand from Mondays to Saturdays. This used a similar low-cost model to its Megabus service. Megatrain tickets were available on certain services expected to be lightly loaded. Tickets were generally between London Waterloo and other principal stations, and ticket-holders are assigned to a specific train.

==Performance==
Latest performance figures released by Network Rail for period 5 (2014/15) were 88.2% (Public Performance Measure – PPM) and 88.9% (Moving Annual Average – MAA) for the 12 months up to 16 August 2014.

==Rolling stock==
===Electric===
====Desiro fleet====
The introduction of Desiro rolling stock built by Siemens was to replace the old , , and slam-door trains, which were life-expired and did not meet modern health and safety requirements; a franchise commitment was to replace all slam-door stock by the end of 2005. The Desiro trains have on-board information systems and full air-conditioning. Their faster acceleration is counterbalanced by the need to dwell longer at each station, since they have fewer doors.

The Desiro stock comes in two variants – units which have four 20 m cars and are mainly used on suburban and outer-suburban services, and units which have five 23 m cars as well as intercity-style door layouts and are used on longer-distance services to and .

====British Rail EMUs (Class 455)====
South West Trains operated a fleet of metro-style commuter trains on services from London Waterloo to Shepperton, Hampton Court, Woking, Guildford, Dorking and Chessington, as well as services on the Kingston and Hounslow loops and occasionally on Windsor line services. These were built for British Rail.

A full refurbishment programme started in 2004 on the fleet of 91 four-car units, and was completed in March 2008. Modifications included a new 2+2 seating layout with high-back seats, CCTV, cycle storage, wheelchair space, doors that open further to allow for faster alighting, and additional passenger information systems.

====British Rail EMUs (Class 456)====
All 24 two-car EMUs were transferred from Southern to SWT, with the first units entering SWT service on 23 March 2014. These early 1990s-built units are compatible with the existing Class 455 fleet and are coupled with these to form ten-car trains, increasing capacity on some local services in and out of Waterloo.

====Coradia Juniper fleet (Class 458/0 – 458/5)====
Thirty of these four-car units were ordered by South West Trains in 1998, to create extra capacity and to replace some of the ageing Class 411 (4-CEP) trains, which at the time were on short-term lease. Deliveries of these trains began in 1998.

The class suffered major technical problems, so in the end, none of the older trains were withdrawn from service at that time. It was six more years, in 2004, before the full fleet was in service. In 2003 and 2004, reliability was so poor that, although they were only six years old, South West Trains decided that the units should be replaced by 2005 with the newer &quot;Desiro&quot; units. Only a handful of units were required each day to help maintain services from Waterloo to Reading, and these had been expected to cease after 31 July 2006, when the lease with the rolling stock company expired. An application by SWT to extend this by six months was refused, as the class did not meet all the requirements of disability legislation.

However, later it was decided that, on or before the start of the new franchise in February 2007, the class would be reinstated and take over all operations on the Waterloo to Reading line, indirectly covering the loss of the Class 442. They have been fitted with new, larger destination screens that comply with the disability legislation, but the trains still fall foul in some other areas, such as the height of the door-open buttons.

All 30 Class 458 trains were split up and the 120 vehicles reconfigured into 36 five-car sets, incorporating 60 extra vehicles from the mechanically similar formerly used on Gatwick Express services. The five-car sets are now designated Class 458/5 and since 2014 have been coupled together to form ten-car trains.

The first two of the five-car sets were delivered in October 2013, and underwent testing ahead of the introduction of the first ten-car train into service in December 2013. Passenger service started in March 2014, with the work concluding in 2016, thereby rendering the Class 458/0 extinct.

===Diesel===
South West Trains had 11 two-car units and 30 three-car units (22 Class 159/0 and eight Class 159/1).

The Class 159/1 units were converted at Wabtec, Doncaster from Class 158s, received from First TransPennine Express in exchange for s. Eleven further two-car Class 158 units were received from First TransPennine Express, which were also refurbished at Wabtec.

The Class 159 has on occasion been used for railtours.

===Locomotives===
Although South West Trains did not operate locomotive-hauled services, until 2009 it maintained three locomotives for recovery duties. Locomotive 73109 had been in service with SWT since the start of the franchise; the other two, 73201 and 73235, were acquired from Gatwick Express in 2005. 73235 was the only one of the three locomotives to be owned by South West Trains at the end of the Franchise.

===Fleet at end of franchise ===
===Isle of Wight Fleet===
===Past fleet===
Former units operated by South West Trains include:
====Wessex Electrics fleet====
These units were initially dedicated to the Weymouth line but, in the 1990s, began to be operated on the London to Portsmouth direct line also. In preparation for the Class 444 and Class 450 &quot;Desiro&quot; units taking over from the slam-door fleet, the Wessex Electrics were withdrawn from Portsmouth line services and were again wholly dedicated to the Weymouth line.

South West Trains announced that it would be withdrawing these units, and they last ran on 3 February 2007. This move coincided with SWT reinstating all Class 458s for the Waterloo–Reading line. As a result, the Class 444 inherited the Waterloo–Weymouth route and the Class 450 took over some Portsmouth Harbour services, while the Class 442 units went into storage at Eastleigh. From 2008 to 2017, Southern leased these trains for its Gatwick Express service and operated them on services from London Victoria to Gatwick Airport and Brighton. Eighteen Class 442 units were supposed to return to the franchise when the changeover to South Western Railway occurred, but the fleet was withdrawn in 2021 and will now be replaced by modified class 458s.

====Turbostar fleet====
In 2000, South West Trains acquired eight 2-car Class 170/3 units to supplement its existing Class 159 fleet. They were used on London to Salisbury services as well as a new Southampton local service, and on Reading to Basingstoke services. They were sometimes pressed into use on Waterloo-Exeter services but, as they were not fitted with end gangways for catering or selective door opening for the short platforms at some stations, this was not a regular route.

From late 2006 to mid-2007, the Class 170 units were gradually transferred to First TransPennine Express in exchange for a larger number of Class 158 units, to expand and standardise the fleet. One unit, 170392, originally built to Southern specifications but taken over by SWT soon after its construction, went to Southern and was converted to a Class 171.

====Preserved trains====

Of the Classes 411, 412, 421 and 423 slam-door trains, several complete former SWT units have been preserved.
*Class 411 411198 at Chinnor and Princes Risborough Railway
*Class 412 412311 and 422315 at Eden Valley Railway
*Class 412 412325 at East Kent Railway
*Class 421 421399 at Dartmoor Railway
*Class 421 421497 at Mid-Norfolk Railway
*Class 421 421498 at Epping Ongar Railway
*Class 423 423417 at Bluebell Railway, currently at Strawberry Hill.
In contrast, just two former Southern units have been preserved – one Class 421 and one Class 423. No complete units from South Eastern Trains have been preserved.

Class 121/Class 960 55028 is preserved on the Swanage Railway.

==Liveries==
==Depots==
===Wimbledon===

Wimbledon Traincare depot is located between Wimbledon and Earlsfield stations, on the main line to Waterloo, next to the Wimbledon railway viaduct.

===Bournemouth===

Bournemouth depot is southwest of Bournemouth station, occupying the approach to the former Bournemouth West station. Until their withdrawal in February 2007, the depot was home to the Class 442 (5Wes) &quot;Wessex Electrics&quot;. The branch turns off at Branksome station where trains can be seen stopping at platform 2 and reversing into the depot.

===Clapham===
Clapham Junction depot provides stabling for the Desiro fleet.

===Northam===

Northam depot was built by Siemens in 2002 as the home depot for the Desiro fleet as part of a 20-year maintenance contract. It is located south of St Denys station and is near Southampton Football Club&#x27;s St Mary&#x27;s Stadium.

===Effingham===

Located next to Effingham Junction station, the depot is used for the berthing of MPVs (Multipurpose Vehicles). It has two pitted roads and a fuel point.

===Salisbury===

Salisbury depot provides servicing for South West Trains&#x27; diesel fleet.

===Fratton===

Fratton Traincare depot is in central Portsea Island, alongside Fratton station. It has a carriage washer and is the fuelling point for the 158s and 159s. The depot has a train shed with two pitted roads for maintenance of rolling stock. Class 444 and 450 units berth overnight. Stabling sidings and bay platforms at Portsmouth &amp; Southsea station are co-ordinated from the depot.

===Farnham===
Farnham depot, in Weydon Lane, was opened by the Southern Railway at the time of the electrification of the Portsmouth and lines in 1937. It was refurbished for the introduction of modern units when slam-door trains were replaced circa 2005. At the same time, disused quarry and ballast dump sidings behind the carriage shed were removed and a number of outdoor sidings were laid for overnight storage and servicing of units.

<doc id="234469" wikidata="Q1007353" url="?curid=234469" title="Green Party faction (Bundestag)">
<text>The [[German Green Party]] (&quot;Bündnis 90/Die Grünen&quot; following a 1993 merger with former East German Alliance 90) has been present in the German parliament (Bundestag) continuously since 29 March 1983 as a parliamentarian party. The status as a fraktion was lost from 1990 to 1994, being demoted to a &quot;Gruppe&quot; (group), after only the East German wing managed to pass the 5% election threshold in the December 1990 German federal election.

==10th Bundestag (1983–1987)==
Scoring 5.6% in the federal parliamentary elections in 1983, the Greens entered the Bundestag for the first time with a total of 28 seats. Faction members were rotated after two years in 1985 (with the exception of Petra Kelly and Gert Bastian), but the concept was abolished in May 1986 again. The executive board, elected by faction members on 3 April 1984, consisted of Annemarie Borgmann, Waltraud Schoppe, Antje Vollmer, Christa Nickels, Heidemarie Dann and Erika Hickel.

The members of the faction were:

==11th Bundestag (1987–1990)==
In the 1987 parliamentary elections, the Green Party managed to increase its share of votes to 8.3%, gaining 44 parliament seats in the process. When the East German parliament, the &quot;Volkskammer&quot;, which was freely elected on 18 March 1990 for the first time, was disbanded in the process of the German reunification, another 7 seats were added as 7 members of the 21-member &quot;Volkskammer&quot; faction of the Green Party, elected by their peers, entered the Bundestag.

The members of the faction were:

* Marieluise Beck-Oberdorf
* Angelika Beer

In 1990, elections were held separately in former East and West Germany; in West Germany, the Green Party did not manage to gain enough votes to enter parliament, only scoring 4.8% instead of the necessary 5%, but in East Germany, the Greens gained a 6.1% share of the votes and 8 seats in the Bundestag. While a green presence in the 12th Bundestag was thus secured, the Greens could not form a faction, instead remaining a &quot;group&quot; (with less rights and a smaller budget).

<doc id="234474" wikidata="Q1517194" url="?curid=234474" title="Nubian languages">
<text>The Nubian languages are a group of related languages spoken by the Nubians. Nubian languages were spoken throughout much of Sudan, but as a result of Arabization they are today mostly limited to the Nile Valley between Aswan (southern Egypt) and Al Dabbah. In the 1956 Census of Sudan there were 167,831 speakers of Nubian languages. Nubian is not to be confused with the various Nuba languages spoken in villages in the Nuba mountains and Darfur.

More recent classifications, such as those in Glottolog, consider that Nubian languages form a primary language family. Older classifications consider Nubian to be a branch of the Nilo-Saharan phylum, a proposal that has low support among linguists due to a lack of supporting data.

==History==

Old Nubian is preserved in at least a hundred pages of documents, comprising both texts of a Christian religious nature and documentary texts dealing with state and legal affairs. Old Nubian was written with a slanted uncial variety of the Coptic alphabet, with the addition of characters derived from Meroitic. These documents range in date from the 8th to the 15th century AD. Old Nubian is currently considered ancestral to modern Nobiin, even though it shows signs of extensive contact with Dongolawi. 

Another, as yet undeciphered, Nubian language has been preserved in a few inscriptions found in Soba and Musawwarat es-Sufra and is assumed to have been the language of the kingdom of Alodia. Since their publication by Adolf Ermann in 1881, they have been referred to as &#x27;Alwan inscriptions&#x27;, &#x27;Alwan Nubian or &#x27;Soba Nubian&#x27;. This language appears to have become extinct by the 19th century.

A reconstruction of Proto-Nubian has been proposed by Claude Rilly (2010: 272–273).

==Present-day languages==
Rilly (2010) distinguishes the following Nubian languages, spoken by in total about 900,000 speakers:
# Nobiin, is the second largest Nubian language with 545,000 speakers in Egypt, Sudan, and the Nubian diaspora. Previously known by the geographic terms Mahas and Fadicca/Fiadicca. 
# Kenzi (endonym: Mattokki) with 865,000 speakers in Egypt and Dongolawi (endonym: Andaandi) with 180,000 speakers in Sudan. They are no longer considered a single language, but closely related. The split between Kenzi and Dongolawi is dated relatively recently to around the 15th century. Dongolawi is now spoken as far south as ed-Debbah, but as late as the 19th century could be found as far south as Korti and probably even further upstream.
# Midob (Meidob) with 50,000 speakers. The language is spoken primarily in and around the Malha volcanic crater in North Darfur.
# Birgid, now extinct, was spoken north of Nyala around Menawashei, with the last known speakers alive in the 1970s. It was the predominant language between the corridor of Nyala and al-Fashir in the north and the Bahr al-Arab in the south as recently as 1860.
# Hill Nubian or Kordofan Nubian, a group of closely related languages or dialects spoken in various villages in the northern Nuba Mountains; in particular by the Dilling, Debri, and Kadaru. An extinct language, Haraza, is known only from a few dozen words recalled by village elders in 1923.

Synchronic research on the Nubian languages began in the last decades of the nineteenth century, first focusing on the Nile Nubian languages Nobiin and Kenzi-Dongolawi. Several well-known Africanists have occupied themselves with Nubian, most notably Lepsius (1880), Reinisch (1879) and Meinhof (1918); other early Nubian scholars include Almkvist and Schäfer. Additionally, important comparative work on the Nubian languages has been carried out by Thelwall, Marianne Bechhaus-Gerst in the second half of the twentieth century and Claude Rilly and George Starostin in the twenty-first.

==Classification==

Traditionally, the Nubian languages are divided into three branches: Northern (Nile), Western (Darfur), and Central. &quot;Ethnologue&#x27;s&quot; classifies the Nubian languages as follows:.
* Nubian
** Northern (Nile)
*** Old Nubian
**** Nobiin
** Western (Darfur)
*** Midob
** Central
*** Kenzi
*** Birgid
*** Dongolawi
*** Hill (Kordofan)
**** Kadaru-Ghulfan
***** Ghulfan
***** Kadaru
**** Unclassified
***** Dair
***** Dilling
***** El Hugeirat
***** Karko
***** Wali
Glottolog groups all non-Northern Nubian branches in a single group named West-Central Nubian. Additionally, within Hill Nubian, Glottolog places Dair in the same branch as Kadaru.

The relation between Dongolawi and Nobiin remains a matter of debate within Nubian Studies. Ethnologue&#x27;s classification is based on glotto-chronological research of Thelwall (1982) and Bechhaus-Gerst (1996), which considers Nobiin the earliest branching from Proto-Nubian. They attribute the current syntactical and phonological proximity between Nobiin and Dongolawi to extensive language contact. Arguing that there is no archeological evidence for a separate migration to the Nile of Dongolawi speakers, Rilly (2010) provides evidence that the difference in vocabulary between Nobiin and Dongolawi is mainly due to a pre-Nubian substrate underneath Nobiin, which he relates to the Meroitic. Approaching the inherited proto-Nubian vocabulary in all Nubian languages systematically through a comparative linguistic approach, Rilly arrives at the following classification:
* Nubian
** Nile Nubian
*** Old Nubian
**** Nobiin
*** Kenzi-Dongolawi
**** Dongolawi
**** Kenzi
** Western Nubian
*** Birgid
*** Midob-Kordofan
**** Midob
**** Kordofan
==Orthography==
There are three currently active proposals for a Nubian alphabet: based on the Arabic script, the Greek script, the Latin script and the Old Nubian alphabet. In the publication of various books of proverbs, dictionaries, and textbooks since the 1950s, Latin has been used by four authors, Arabic by two authors, and Old Nubian by three authors. For Arabic, the extended ISESCO system may be used to indicate vowels and consonants not found in the Arabic alphabet itself.

<text>James Mallahan Cain (July 1, 1892 – October 27, 1977) was an American novelist, journalist and screenwriter. He is widely regarded as a progenitor of the hardboiled school of American crime fiction.

His novels &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot; (1934), &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; (1936), &quot;Serenade&quot; (1937), &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot; (1941) and &quot;The Butterfly&quot; (1947) brought him critical acclaim and an immense popular readership in America and abroad.

Though Cain never delivered a successful Hollywood screenplay, several of his novels were made into highly regarded films, among them &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; (1944), &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot; (1945) and &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot; (1946).

In 1970, Cain became one of the Edgar Awards&#x27; Grand Masters. He continued to write and publish novels into his eighties. A number of his works were issued posthumously, including &quot;The Cocktail Waitress&quot; (2012).

==Family background==
Cain&#x27;s paternal and maternal grandparents emigrated from Ireland and both families settled in New Haven, Connecticut during the early 1850s. Cain reported they were not agrarian refugees of the Great Famine of Ireland. His paternal grandfather P. W. Cain was an industrial worker who served as a superintendent for the Hartford Railroad. His wife, Mary (née Kelly), died in a typhoid fever outbreak in 1876. Cain&#x27;s father, James W. &quot;Jim&quot; Cain, then 16 years-of-age, contracted but survived the illness. When P. W. Cain remarried, the disaffected Jim Cain gravitated to the home of the local Mallahan family, among whose daughters was Rose Mallahan, his future wife and mother to the famous author.

The elder James W. Cain matriculated to Yale University in 1880 at the age of 20 and taught evening school to pay for his tuition. A consummate Yale man—&quot;handsome, articulate, intelligent and athletic&quot;—he graduated in 1884 and became a professor at St. John&#x27;s College in Annapolis, Maryland.

Cain&#x27;s maternal grandmother, Brigid Ingoldsby Mallahan, was a descendant of Irish pirate William Ingoldsby, who had captured and ravaged the English colonial city of New York in 1691. His mother, Rose Mallahan—&quot;small, pretty and very distinguished-looking&quot;—had trained for seven years in her youth as a coloratura soprano and expected to pursue a career in opera after giving recitals in New Haven. She gave up these musical aspirations to marry her girlhood sweetheart Jim Cain in 1890. She gave birth to the first of her five children on July 1, 1892: James Mallahan Cain.

==Education==
The six-year-old Cain entered grade school in Annapolis in 1898. An upbringing in a household with two highly literate parents contributed to the boy&#x27;s &quot;impeccable grammar&quot; and his early enthusiasm for literature. Cain&#x27;s father, then the head of the Annapolis School Board, indulged his son&#x27;s request to skip two grades, from third to fifth. Though intellectually precocious, Cain later regretted the advancement, especially as his classmates entered puberty well ahead of him. The elder Cain&#x27;s superior performance at St. John&#x27;s College earned him the post of President of Washington College, at the time &quot;a small non-denominational, co-educational school.&quot; In 1903, when Cain turned eleven, the family relocated to Chestertown, Maryland.

While living in Chestertown, Cain recalled encountering a garrulous bricklayer, Ike Newton, who introduced the young student to the &quot;language of an uneducated but articulate person.&quot; Biographer Roy Hoopes traces Cain&#x27;s fascination with common speech to this encounter, and compares it to the experiences of authors Jonathan Swift and Stephen Crane. Cain credited Newton&#x27;s &quot;vulgate&quot; as instrumental to the development of his narrative style as a novelist. By the age of 12, Cain was a &quot;voracious&quot; reader and familiar with the literary works of Edgar Allan Poe, William Thackeray, James Fenimore Cooper, Alexandre Dumas, Arthur Conan Doyle and Robert Louis Stevenson. Cain was granted permission to take preparatory classes at Washington College, where he took courses with youths four years his senior.

By the time Cain reached the age of 13, he had rejected the doctrines of the Catholic Church, especially the confessional, calling it &quot;mumbo-jumbo.&quot; As an adult, according to biographer Roy Hoopes, &quot;he came to regard the Church as one of the most ominous factors in all human history&quot; and crafted his own independent view of &quot;life and God.&quot; In Chestertown, Cain continued to sing in the church choir as a youth.

Though considered &quot;one of the bright students on campus&quot;, his performance at the university was &quot;erratic.&quot; Excelling in German and French language courses, his grades in Greek were mediocre; he passed his classes in &quot;science, chemistry and Latin&quot; but favored his coursework in history and literature. He also demonstrated an aptitude for mathematics, but found the topic unchallenging. Just before his eighteenth birthday, Cain took his Artium Baccalaureus degree. Upon graduation from Washington College, neither Cain nor his family had any plans for his career.

==Early employment: 1910–1917==
After moving to Baltimore to live independently, Cain engaged in desultory employment, working briefly as a ledger clerk for a public utility, then serving for two years as a road inspector for the State of Maryland. His clear and incisive reports on operations led Cain to contemplate a career in writing. In his late teens, he frequented local brothels with male friends (Cain reports that he did not sleep with the prostitutes) and had a number of affairs with older women.

In 1913 he accepted a job as principal of a high school in Vienna, Maryland, and while there enjoyed performing as a singer at community gatherings. When he informed his family that he wished to pursue a career as a professional operatic singer, his mother, a trained soprano, emphatically vetoed him: &quot;You have no voice, no looks, no stage personality. Not one! You have some musical sense, but that is not enough.&quot; Undeterred, Cain—possessing only a &quot;good, barroom bass&quot;—moved to Washington D. C. to enroll in a voice training course. To support himself he worked briefly in &quot;office to office&quot; insurance salesmanship for the General Accident Company but never sold a single policy.

After quitting a low-paying job as a Victrola salesman, Cain abandoned his hopes of becoming a professional singer and committed himself to becoming a writer, receiving his parents&#x27; blessings. Biographer Roy Hoopes notes that Cain&#x27;s postgraduate period was not &quot;misspent&quot;:

Cain returned home to Chestertown in 1914 and was hired as an English instructor at Washington College, and there acquired a master&#x27;s degree in drama. For years he made efforts to write fiction, but without success. In 1917, at the age of 24, he was still living at home and as yet unpublished. He accepted a position as a math teacher in the autumn and registered for the draft when the United States entered World War I, but was initially rejected for respiratory disorders.

==Career in journalism: 1917–1935==
The &quot;Baltimore American&quot; hired Cain as a cub reporter in the summer of 1917 and assigned him to a police unit. His first article, on a local drowning, so impressed the copy editor that Cain was instantly promoted to major assignments related to the war effort. Cain honored his commitment to serve as a math teacher, but soon quit to return to journalism. He was hired by &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; in early 1918.

In June 1918, Cain, a skeptic of American war propaganda, was inducted into the Army and began basic training at Camp Meade, Maryland.

==Military service, Signal Corps: 1918–1919==
Cain sought and obtained assignment to a combat unit destined for action in France, the 79th Infantry Division, known as both the &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; and the &quot;Lorraine Cross&quot; Division. Private First Class Cain&#x27;s unit was engaged in the summer of 1918, after the Battle of the Marne, in a major offensive action, the Meuse-Argonne campaign. Attached to headquarters, Cain manned observation posts. His efforts to establish battlefield contact with the 157th Infantry Brigade on September 26–27 became the basis for his 1929 short story &quot;The Taking of Montfaucon.&quot; In late October, weeks before the end of the war, Cain barely survived a poison gas attack. Cain was assigned as editor-in-chief of the 157th&#x27;s newsletter &quot;The Lorraine Cross.&quot; Alexander Woollcott, then a sergeant editing &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; called it &quot;a snappy young journal.&quot; Cain was designated a publicity officer for the Division.

He was mustered out of the army on June 5, 1919, at Hoboken, New Jersey

==Newspaperman: the Roaring Twenties==
Cain resumed working for The Baltimore Sun, serving as a copy editor at $30 a week in the post-war period. At his own request, Cain was assigned to cover the industrial labor movement and its purported infiltration by Bolsheviks during the first Red Scare.

Cain married Mary Rebekah Clough, his college sweetheart, on 17 January 1920. They would separate in 1924 and divorce in 1927.

In early 1920 Cain became aware of the writing of the famed H. L. Mencken, editor of &quot;The Smart Set&quot;, &quot;considered the most sophisticated magazine in the country at the time.&quot; According to biographer Roy Hoopes, his introduction to Mencken&#x27;s writing was &quot;the most important event of Cain&#x27;s professional career ...Mencken&#x27;s style almost intoxicated him...&quot; Though Cain submitted essays to &quot;The Smart Set&quot;, none were approved. Cain, however, established a friendly correspondence with the editor.

In 1921 Cain covered the Bill Blizzard treason trial for the Sun in the aftermath of the Battle of Blair Mountain and the West Virginia coal mining labor struggles. Cain&#x27;s highly acclaimed essay &quot;The Battleground of Coal&quot; was published as the lead article in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; in October 1922, followed by a similar article in &quot;The Nation&quot;. As an investigative journalist, Cain joined the United Mine Workers and served underground in a West Virginia coal mine, interviewing workers and management. His experiences there would inform two of his later novels: &quot;Past All Dishonor&quot; (1946) and &quot;The Butterfly&quot; (1947).

In 1923, Cain and his wife Mary moved to Annapolis, Maryland where he began teaching courses in journalism and English at St. John&#x27;s College.

==&quot;The American Mercury&quot;: 1924–1935==
H. L. Mencken enlisted Cain to contribute to his new literary journal &quot;The American Mercury&quot; launched in January 1924 with George Jean Nathan and Alfred A. Knopf Sr. Cain&#x27;s association with this monthly journal would mark &quot;the beginning of his reputation as a major magazine writer.&quot; As his professional and personal alliance with Mencken deepened, Cain quit his teaching job at St. John&#x27;s and committed himself solely to writing after moving to New York City. Cain&#x27;s subject matter was characterized by scurrilous and humorous attacks on &quot;American types and institutions...the pastor, county officials, town commissioners, and the whole concept of do-gooding service...&quot; His 1925 &quot;Mercury&quot; dialogue &quot;The Hero&quot; exemplifies this style of satirical writing.

Cain entered a sanitorium for treatment of tuberculosis and was successfully treated and released by September 1924.

Under Mencken&#x27;s auspices, Cain was hired as the human-interest story editorial writer for the &quot;New York World&quot; by Walter Lippmann. Cain&#x27;s highly literate, grammatically adroit and entertaining pieces earned him a three-year contract at $125 a week at the &quot;World&quot;. Though exhorted to create &quot;lighthearted pieces&quot;, Cain emerged as &quot;one of the most prolific and respected editorial hands that ever worked for the &quot;World&quot;.&quot; Cain&#x27;s last piece for the &quot;Mercury&quot;, entitled &quot;Close Harmony,&quot; appeared in October, 1935.

Cain&#x27;s preoccupation with writing a novel was stimulated by his immersion in the social and professional associations of the mid-1920s, a period which saw the publication of major literary works by F. Scott Fitzgerald, Theodore Drieser, Willa Cather, Ernest Hemingway, Sinclair Lewis, Virginia Wolff, Ellen Glasgow, and Thomas Mann. Publisher and playwrights Philip Goodman and Vincent Laurence encouraged Cain to write a play about the evangelical Christian fundamentalism he had encountered during his reporting in West Virginia: &quot;Crashing the Gates&quot; opened in New England at Stamford and Worcester in February 1926 but closed after two weeks, receiving mixed reviews.
On 2 July 1927, Cain married Elina Tyszecki, a Finnish-American divorcee and mother of two children, after having had a lengthy affair. They would divorce in 1942.

===&quot;Pastorale&quot; and the first-person confessional narrative===
At the age of 36, Cain wrote his first short story, &quot;Pastorale&quot;, a humorous treatment of a lurid tale of murder. Published in &quot;The American Mercury&quot; in 1928, this &quot;Ring Lardner-style&quot; work is considered by novelist David Madden his &quot;best short story.&quot; The first-person narrative persona that Cain adopted in &quot;Pastorale&quot; reflects the handling of his newspaper editorials, in which he typically assumed the identity of a character not his own, confessing &quot;I have no [literary] capacity to be Cain. I can&#x27;t be Cain. I can anybody &quot;except&quot; Cain&quot;, though recognizing his skill in the first-person. Critic Roy Hoopes writes:

In 1930, a collection of Cain&#x27;s dramatic dialogues and sketches was published in &quot;Our Government&quot; by Alfred A. Knopf publishers.

===&quot;The New Yorker&quot;: 1931===
When the &quot;New York World&quot; ceased publishing in 1931, Cain, on the recommendation of Morris Markey, was hired by Harold Ross to act as managing editor for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. For nine months Cain presided over the editorial staff which included James Thurber, Katherine White, E. B. White and Wolcott Gibbs. The journal published pieces by the outstanding literary figures of the early 1930s.

Cain&#x27;s tempestuous relationship with Ross led to his departure in November 1931 when Cain&#x27;s agent James Geller negotiated a contract as a screenwriter for Paramount Pictures at $400 a week.

==Novelist and screenwriter: Hollywood, 1931–1948==
Hired by Paramount while the studio was entering bankruptcy, Cain was assigned to work on a remake of Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; (1923), but was dropped from the project after criticizing the story treatment of his supervisor. After working on a script about novelist Harvey Fergusson&#x27;s &quot;Hot Saturday&quot; (1926), Cain was terminated by Paramount in May 1932, confirming his &quot;basic dislike of [motion] pictures.&quot;

Unemployed in 1932, Cain looked to the Southern California milieu for a short story and wrote &quot;The Baby in the Icebox&quot;, which H. L. Mencken published in &quot;American Mercury&quot;. The work caused &quot;much excitement&quot; and was widely republished in America and Europe. The story was adapted to film as &quot;She Made Her Bed&quot; (1934) by Paramount, though the studio declined to hire Cain to write the script. Cain&#x27;s highly regarded non-fiction appraisal of the greater Los Angeles area, &quot;Paradise&quot;, also appeared in the &quot;Mercury&quot; in 1933.

===First-person &quot;chef-d&#x27;œuvres&quot;: 1934–1938===
Cain was engaged briefly by film producer Harry Cohn of Columbia Pictures as a screenwriter, but unable to produce a suitable script he was dismissed. For most of 1933 Cain was occupied writing the novel that would demonstrate a mastery of the first-person confessional that would make him famous: &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot;. With the support of Walter Lippman, Alfred A. Knopf publishers purchased the work which became &quot;an immediate critical and commercial success.&quot; A story of adultery and murder, &quot;a small fable&quot; according to Cain, his first novel has been reprinted in the millions since publication and &quot;one of America&#x27;s all-time best-sellers.&quot;

Two literary projects emerged from &quot;Postman&quot;: a play and a serial modeled after the story. Cain was determined to write a successful play after the failure of &quot;Crashing the Gate&quot; in 1926. Producer Jack Curtis Sr. bought the rights to the novel and director Robert B. Sinclair staged a theatrical adaptation of &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot;, opening in February 1936. Despite Cain&#x27;s numerous revisions of the work, the reviews were largely negative and it closed after 73 performances.

Cain wrote a facsimile of &quot;Postman&quot; that published as a &quot;Liberty&quot; magazine serial in 1936: &quot;Double Indemnity&quot;, a love-murder conspiracy that unfolds in an insurance fraud. The serial was written &quot;in exactly the same style as the Postman&quot; and is considered one of Cain&#x27;s &quot;finest achievements.&quot; The popularity of the serial added millions to &quot;Liberty&quot;″s readership, and was published as a novella in 1943. The 1944 film adaptation directed by Billy Wilder is considered a masterpiece of film noir.

Cain&#x27;s next literary project was 1938&#x27;s &quot;Serenade&quot;, an opera-themed novel that addresses &quot;the psychological sources of artistic power and creativity&quot; and identifies heterosexuality as a &quot;sin qua non&quot; for success in the fine arts. Cain&#x27;s handling of the &quot;sensational&quot; topic placed him at &quot;the center of a literary tempest&quot;, sustaining his status as a much sought-after American author.

==Career==
Cain made use of his knowledge of music, particularly opera, in at least five of his works: &quot;Serenade&quot;, about an American opera singer who loses his voice after a homosexual encounter and, after spending part of his life south of the border, re-enters the United States illegally with a Mexican prostitute; &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot;, in which, as part of the subplot, the surviving daughter of a successful businesswoman trains as an opera singer; &quot;Career in C Major&quot;, a short semi-comic novel about the unhappy husband of an aspiring opera singer, who unexpectedly discovers that he has a better voice than she does; &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot;, in which the husband, Nick Papadakis, is a noted opera aficionado; and &quot;The Cocktail Waitress&quot;, in which a widowed waitress is offered money to remarry. In his novel &quot;The Moth&quot;, music is important in the life of the main character. Cain&#x27;s fourth wife, Florence Macbeth, was a retired opera singer.

Cain spent many years in Hollywood working on screenplays, but his name appears as a screenwriter in the credits of only two films: &quot;Stand Up and Fight&quot; (1939) and &quot;Gypsy Wildcat&quot; (1944), for which he is one of three credited screenwriters. For &quot;Algiers&quot; (1938) Cain received a credit for &quot;additional dialogue&quot;, and he had story credits for other films.

In 1975 Roy Hoopes contacted Cain after reading his article in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; about Walter Lippmann. Hoopes conducted a series of interviews with Cain until his death in 1977 which he turned into a biography of the author in 1984.

==American Authors&#x27; Authority==
In 1946, Cain wrote four articles for &quot;Screen Writer&quot; magazine in which he proposed the creation of an &quot;American Authors&#x27; Authority&quot; to hold writers&#x27; copyrights and represent writers in contract negotiations and court disputes. This idea was dubbed the &quot;Cain plan&quot; in the media. The plan was denounced as communist by some writers, who formed the American Writers Association to oppose it. James T. Farrell was the foremost of these opponents. The &quot;Saturday Review&quot; printed a debate between Cain and Farrell in November 1946. Farrell argued that the commercial Hollywood writers would control the market and keep out independents. &quot;This idea is stamped in the crude conceptions of the artist which Mr. Cain holds, the notion that the artist is a kind of idiot who thinks that he is a God, but who has only the defects and none of the virtues of a God.&quot; In his reply, Cain argued that his opponents understood the issue incorrectly as freedom versus control. It is fear of reprisals from publishers, Cain said, that is the real cause of opposition from well-to-do writers.

Although Cain worked vigorously to promote the Authority, it did not gain widespread support, and the plan was abandoned.

==Personal life==
Cain was married to Mary Clough in 1919. That marriage ended in divorce, and he soon married Elina Sjösted Tyszecka. Cain never had any children of his own, but he was close to Elina&#x27;s two children from a previous marriage. In 1944, Cain married the film actress Aileen Pringle, but the marriage was a tempestuous union and dissolved in a bitter divorce two years later. His fourth marriage, to Florence Macbeth, lasted until her death in 1966.

Cain continued writing up to his death, at the age of 85. He published many novels from the late 1940s onward, but none achieved the financial and popular success of his earlier books.

<text>Whiplash, whose formal term is whiplash associated disorders (WAD), is a range of injuries to the neck caused by or related to a sudden distortion of the neck associated with extension, although the exact injury mechanisms remain unknown. The term &quot;whiplash&quot; is a colloquialism. &quot;Cervical acceleration–deceleration&quot; (CAD) describes the mechanism of the injury, while WAD describes the subsequent injuries and symptoms.

Whiplash is commonly associated with motor vehicle accidents, usually when the vehicle has been hit in the rear; however, the injury can be sustained in many other ways, including headbanging, bungee jumping and falls. It is one of the most frequently claimed injuries on vehicle insurance policies in certain countries; for example, in the United Kingdom 430,000 people made an insurance claim for whiplash in 2007, accounting for 14% of every driver&#x27;s premium. In the United States, it is estimated that more than 65% of all bodily injury claims are whiplash related, translating to around $8 billion in economic costs per year.

Before the invention of the car, whiplash injuries were called &quot;railway spine&quot; as they were noted mostly in connection with train collisions. The first case of severe neck pain arising from a train collision was documented around 1919. The number of whiplash injuries has since risen sharply due to rear-end motor vehicle collisions. Given the wide variety of symptoms associated with whiplash injuries, the Quebec Task Force on Whiplash-Associated Disorders coined the phrase &#x27;Whiplash-Associated Disorders&#x27;.

While there is broad consensus that acute whiplash is not uncommon, the topic of chronic whiplash is controversial, with studies in at least three countries showing zero to low prevalence, and some academics positing a linkage to financial issues.

==Signs and symptoms==

Symptoms reported by affected people include: pain and aching to the neck and back, referred pain to the shoulders, sensory disturbance (such as pins and needles) to the arms and legs, and headaches. Symptoms can appear directly after the injury, but often are not felt until days afterwards. Whiplash is usually confined to the spine. The most common areas of the spine affected by whiplash are the neck and middle of the spine. &quot;Neck&quot; pain is very common between the shoulder and the neck. The &quot;missing link&quot; of whiplash may be towards or inside the shoulder and this would explain why neck therapy alone frequently does not give lasting relief.

Cognitive symptoms following whiplash trauma, such as being easily distracted or irritated, seems to be common and possibly linked to a poorer prognosis.

==Cause==
The exact injury mechanism that causes whiplash injuries is forceful sudden hyperextension followed by hyperflexion of the cervical vertebrae, mainly spraining the nuchal ligament and the Anterior Longitudinal Ligament respectively. A whiplash injury may be the result of impulsive retracting of the spine, mainly the ligament: anterior longitudinal ligament which is stretched or tears, as the head snaps forward and then back again causing a whiplash injury.

A whiplash injury from an automobile accident is called a cervical acceleration–deceleration injury. Cadaver studies have shown that as an automobile occupant is hit from behind, the forces from the seat back compress the kyphosis of the thoracic spine, which provides an axial load on the lumbar spine and cervical spine. This forces the cervical spine to deform into an S-shape where the lower cervical spine is forced into a kyphosis while the upper cervical spine maintains its lordosis. As the injury progresses, the whole cervical spine is finally hyper-extended.

Whiplash may be caused by any motion similar to a rear-end collision in a motor vehicle, such as may take place on a roller coaster or other rides at an amusement park, sports injuries such as skiing accidents, other modes of transportation such as airplane travel, or from being hit, kicked or shaken..

Whiplash associated disorders sometimes include injury to the cerebrum. In a severe cervical acceleration–deceleration syndrome, a brain injury known as a coup contrecoup injury occurs. A coup contrecoup injury occurs as the brain is accelerated into the cranium as the head and neck hyperextend, and is then accelerated into the other side as the head and neck rebound to hyper-flexion or neutral position.

&quot;Volunteer studies of experimental, low-velocity rear-end collisions have shown a percentage of subjects to report short-lived symptoms&quot;,

From this type of research, it has been inferred that whiplash symptoms might not always have any pathological (injury) explanation.

However, over the last decade, academic surgeons in the UK and US have sought to unravel the whiplash enigma. A 1000-case, four-year observational study published in 2012 said that the &quot;missing link&quot; in whiplash injuries is the trapezius muscle which may be damaged through eccentric muscle contraction during the whiplash mechanism described above and below. Another study suggested that &quot;shneck pain&quot; was in the nearby supraspinatus muscle and this resulted from a seemingly asymptomatic form of shoulder impingement. Shoulder impingement is commonly asymptomatic and the shoulder may be injured along with the neck in a motor vehicle accident. Whiplash due to The Referred Shoulder Impingement Syndrome was successfully treated using conventional treatments for shoulder impingement including anti-inflammatory steroids and non steroids, and by avoiding the overhead position of shoulder impingement during the day and night time. All of this work demonstrates that historically and indeed presently whiplash patients&#x27; pain sources may be missed if it is outside of the neck. Hence the pathology in whiplash may have been missed and the treatment ineffective.

==Mechanism==
Whiplash can be described as a sudden strain to the muscles, bones and nerves in the neck. The neck is made up of seven vertebrae, referred to as the cervical vertebrae. The first two cervical vertebrae, the axis and atlas, are shaped differently from the remaining five. The atlas and axis are responsible for movement of the skull from side to side (cervical rotation to the right and left); also moving forward and backward (cervical flexion and extension). Excessive extension and flexion can disrupt the vertebrae.

There are four phases that occur during &quot;whiplash&quot;: Initial position (before the collision); retraction; extension; and rebound. In the initial position, there is no force on the neck; it is stable due to inertia. Anterior longitudinal ligament injuries in whiplash may lead to cervical instability. They explain that during the retraction phase that is when the actual &quot;whiplash&quot; occurs, since there is an unusual loading of soft tissues. The next phase is the extension: the whole neck and head switches to extension, and it is stopped or limited by the head restraint. The rebound phase transpires as result of the phases that are mentioned.

During the retraction phase, the spine forms an S-Shaped curve, caused by the flexion in the upper planes and hyperextension at the lower planes. If this exceeds their physiological limits, in this phase the injuries occur to the lower cervical vertebrae. In the extension phase, all cervical vertebrae and the head are fully extended, but do not surpass their physiological limits. Most of the injuries happen in C-5 and C-6.

==Pathophysiology==
While the time associated with a specific collision will vary, the following provides an example of the occupant and seat interaction sequence for a collision lasting approximately 300 milliseconds.
==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis occurs through a patient history, head and neck examination, X-rays to rule out bone fractures and may involve the use of medical imaging to determine if there are other injuries.

===Québec Task Force===
The &quot;Québec Task Force&quot; (&quot;QTF&quot;) has divided whiplash-associated disorders into five grades.
* Grade 0: no neck pain, stiffness, or any physical signs are noticed
* Grade 1: neck complaints of pain, stiffness or tenderness only but no physical signs are noted by the examining physician.
* Grade 2: neck complaints and the examining physician finds decreased range of motion and point tenderness in the neck.
* Grade 3: neck complaints plus neurological signs such as decreased deep tendon reflexes, weakness and sensory deficits.
* Grade 4: neck complaints and fracture or dislocation, or injury to the spinal cord.

==Prevention==

The focus of preventive measures to date has been on the design of car seats, primarily through the introduction of head restraints, often called headrests. This approach is potentially problematic given the underlying assumption that purely mechanical factors cause whiplash injuries — an unproven theory. So far the injury reducing effects of head restraints appears to have been low, approximately 5–10%, because car seats have become stiffer in order to increase crashworthiness of cars in high-speed rear-end collisions which in turn could increase the risk of whiplash injury in low-speed rear impact collisions. Improvements in the geometry of car seats through better design and energy absorption could offer additional benefits. Active devices move the body in a crash in order to shift the loads on the car seat.

For the last 40 years, vehicle safety researchers have been designing and gathering information on the ability of head restraints to mitigate injuries resulting from rear-end collisions. As a result, different types of head restraints have been developed by various manufactures to protect their occupants from whiplash.
Below are definitions of different types of head restraints.

Head restraint — refers to a device designed to limit the rearward displacement of an adult occupant&#x27;s head in relation to the torso in order to reduce the risk of injury to the cervical vertebrae in the event of a rear impact. The most effective head restraint must allow a backset motion of less than 60 mm to prevent the hyperextension of the neck during impact.

Integrated head restraint or fixed head restraint — refers to a head restraint formed by the upper part of the seat back, or a head restraint that is not height adjustable and cannot be detached from the seat or the vehicle structure except by the use of tools or following the partial or total removal of the seat furnishing&quot;.

Adjustable head restraint — refers to a head restraint that is capable of being positioned to fit the morphology of the seated occupant. The device may permit horizontal displacement, known as tilt adjustment, and/or vertical displacement, known as height adjustment.

Active head restraint — refers to a device designed to automatically improve head restraint position and/or geometry during an impact&quot;.

Automatically adjusting head restraint — refers to a head restraint that automatically adjusts the position of the head restraint when the seat position is adjusted.

A major issue in whiplash prevention is the lack of proper adjustment of the seat safety system by both drivers and passengers. Studies have shown that a well designed and adjusted head restraint could prevent potentially injurious head-neck kinematics in rear-end collisions by limiting the differential movement of the head and torso. The primary function of a head restraint is to minimize the relative rearward movement of the head and neck during rear impact. During a rear-end collision, the presence of an effective head restraint behind the occupant&#x27;s head can limit the differential movement of the head and torso. A properly placed head restraint where one can sufficiently protect his/her head lower the chances of head injury by up to 35% during a rear-end collision.

In contrast to a properly adjusted head restraint, research suggests that there may be an increased risk of neck injuries if the head restraint is incorrectly positioned. More studies by manufacturers and automobile safety organizations are currently undergoing to examine the best ways to reduce head and torso injuries during a rear-end impact with different geometries of the head restraint and seat-back systems.

In most passenger vehicles where manually adjustable head restraints are fitted, proper use requires sufficient knowledge and awareness by occupants. When driving, the height of the head restraint is critical in influencing injury risk. A restraint should be at least as high as the head&#x27;s center of gravity, or about 9 centimeters (3.5 inches) below the top of the head. The backset, or distance behind the head, should be as small as possible. Backsets of more than 10 centimeters (about 4 inches) have been associated with increased symptoms of neck injury in crashes.
In a sitting position, the minimum height of the restraint should correspond to the top of the driver&#x27;s ear or even higher. In addition, there should be minimal distance between the back of head and the point where it first meets the restraint.

Due to low public awareness of the consequence of incorrect positioning of head restraints, some passenger vehicle manufactures have designed and implemented a range of devices into their models to protect their occupants.

Some current systems are:
* Mercedes-Benz A-Class Active Head Restraint (AHR),
* Saab (Responsible for the first active head restraint), Opel, Ford, Nissan, Subaru, Hyundai, and Peugeot — Active Head restraint (SAHR),
* Volvo and Jaguar — Whiplash Protection System/Whiplash Prevention System (WHIPS), and
* Toyota — Whiplash Injury Lessening (WIL).

The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) and other testing centers around the world have been involved in testing the effectiveness of head restraint and seat systems in laboratory conditions to assess their ability to prevent or mitigate whiplash injuries. They have found that over 60% of new motor vehicles on the market have &quot;good&quot; rated head restraints.

==Management==

===Rehabilitation (e.g. physical therapy)===
Symptoms remaining more than six months after trauma is labelled Whiplash syndrome. The main purpose with early rehabilitation is to reduce the risk for development of Whiplash syndrome. Early rehabilitation for whiplash depends on the grade category. It can be categorized as grade 0 being no pain to grade 4 with a cervical bone fracture or dislocation. Grade 4 obviously needs admission to hospital while grade 0-3 can be managed as outpatients. The symptoms from the potential injury to the cervical spine may be debilitating, and pain was reported to be one of the biggest stressor events experienced in daily living, so it is important to begin rehabilitation immediately to prevent future pain.

Current research supports that active mobilization rather than a soft collar results in a more prompt recovery both in the short and long term perspective. Furthermore, Schnabel and colleagues stated that the soft collar is not a suitable medium for rehabilitation, and the best way of recovery is to include an active rehabilitation program that includes physical therapy exercises and postural modifications. Another study found patients who participated in active therapy shortly after injury increased mobilization of the neck with significantly less pain within four weeks when compared to patients using a cervical collar.

Active treatments are light repetitive exercises that work the area to maintain normality. Basic information is also given to teach the patient that exercises as instructed will not cause any damage to their neck. These exercises are done at home or under the care of a health professional. When beginning a rehabilitation regimen, it&#x27;s important to begin with slow movements which include cervical rotation until pain threshold three to five times per day, flexion and extension of the shoulder joint by moving the arms up and down two to three times, and combining shoulder raises while inhaling and releasing the shoulder raise while exhaling. Soderlund and colleagues also recommend that these exercises should be done every day until pain starts to dissipate. Early mobilization is important for preventing chronic pain, but pain experienced from these exercises might cause psychological symptoms that could have negative impact on recovery. Rosenfeld found that doing active exercises as often as once every waking hour during one month after trauma decreases the need for sick leave three years after trauma from 25% to 5.7%.

Passive treatments such as acupuncture, massage therapy, and stimulation may sometimes be used as a complement to active exercises. Return to normal activities of daily living should be encouraged as soon as possible to maximize and expedite full recovery.

For chronic whiplash patients, rehabilitation is recommended. Patients who entered a rehabilitation program said they were able to control their pain, they continued to use strategies that were taught to them, and were able to go back to their daily activities. A Cochrane review published in 2007 found that evidence neither supports nor refutes the effectiveness conservative treatments including physiotherapy, acupuncture, or a collar to treat Grades 1 or 2.

===Medications===
According to the recommendations made by the Quebec Task Force, treatment for individuals with whiplash associated disorders grade 1–3 may include non-narcotic analgesics. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may also be prescribed in the case of WAD 2 and WAD 3, but their use should be limited to a maximum of three weeks. Botulinum toxin A is used to treat involuntary muscle contraction and spasms. Botulinum toxin type-A is only temporary and repeated injections need to take place in order to feel the effects.

According to a year long follow-up study in 2008 on 186 patients, the WAD-classification and Quebec Task Force regimen were not linked to better clinical outcomes.

==Prognosis==
The consequences of whiplash range from mild pain for a few days (which is the case for most people), to severe disability. It seems that around 50% will have some remaining symptoms.

Alterations in resting state cerebral blood flow have been demonstrated in patients with chronic pain after whiplash injury. There is evidence for persistent inflammation in the neck in patients with chronic pain after whiplash injury.

There has long been a proposed link between whiplash injuries and the development of temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD). A recent review concluded that although there are contradictions in the literature, overall there is moderate evidence that TMD can occasionally follow whiplash injury, and that the incidence of this occurrence is low to moderate.

==Epidemiology==
Whiplash is the term commonly used to describe hyperflexion and hyperextension, and is one of the most common nonfatal car crash injuries. More than one million whiplash injuries occur each year due to car crashes. This is an estimate because not all cases of whiplash are reported. In a given year, an estimated 3.8 people per 1000 experience whiplash symptoms. &quot;Freeman and co-investigators estimated that 6.2% of the US population have late whiplash syndrome&quot;. The majority of cases occur in patients in their late fourth decade. Unless a cervical strain has occurred with additional brain or spinal cord trauma mortality is rare.

Whiplash can occur at speeds of fifteen miles per hour or less; it is the sudden jolt, as one car hits another, that causes one&#x27;s head to be abruptly thrown back and sideways. The more sudden the motion, the more bones, discs, muscles and tendons in ones neck and upper back will be damaged. Spinal cord injuries are responsible for about 6,000 deaths in the US each year and 5,000 whiplash injuries per year result in quadriplegia.

After 12 months, only 1 in 5 patients remain symptomatic, only 11.5% of individuals were able to return to work a year after the injury, and only 35.4% were able to get back to work at a similar level of performance after 20 years. Estimated indirect costs to industry are $66,626 per year, depending on the level and severity. Lastly, the total cost per year was $40.5 billion in 2008, a 317% increase over 1998.

== Incidence ==
Altogether it is of note that, especially in many Western countries, after a motor vehicle collision those involved seek health care for the assessment of injuries and for insurance documentation purposes. In contrast, in many less wealthy countries, there may be limited access to care and insurance may only be available to the wealthy. Against this background, the &quot;(late) whiplash syndrome&quot; (ICD-10: S13.4) has been one special focus of continuous and controversial scientific research since the 1950s as the worldwide incidence of such injuries varies enormously, from 16 to 2000 per 100,000 population, and the late whiplash syndrome in these cases varies between 18% and 40%. Thus, important work by Schrader et al. in &quot;The Lancet&quot; showed that late whiplash syndrome after a motor vehicle collision is rare or uncommon in Lithuania, and Cassidy et al.&#x27;s conclusion in the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot; is that &quot;the elimination of compensation for pain and suffering is associated with a decreased incidence and improved prognosis of whiplash injury&quot;.

Moreover, an experimental study in 2001 places participants in a stationary vehicle with a curtain blocking their rear view, and exposed them to a simulated rear-end collision. Twenty percent of patients had symptoms at 3 days, despite the fact that no collision actually occurred.

From the evolving viewpoint of naturalistic Internet search engine analytics it has been shown in 2017 that the expectations for receiving compensation may influence Internet search behavior in relation to whiplash injury.

<text>The Amadeus Quartet was a string quartet founded in 1947 and disbanded in 1987, having retained its founding members throughout its history.

Noted for its smooth, sophisticated style, its seamless ensemble playing, and its sensitive interpretation,
the quartet has often been seen as working within an Austrian tradition. However, it was formed and based in the United Kingdom.

==History==
Because of their Jewish origin, the violinists Norbert Brainin (12 March 1923 – 10 April 2005), Siegmund Nissel (3 January 1922 – 21 May 2008) and Peter Schidlof (9 July 1922 – 16 August 1987; later violist) were driven out of Vienna after Hitler&#x27;s Anschluss of 1938. Brainin and Schidlof met in a British internment camp at Prees Heath before being transferred to the Isle of Man; many Jewish refugees were confined by the British as &quot;enemy aliens&quot; upon seeking refuge in the UK. Brainin was released after a few months, but Schidlof remained in the camp, where he met Nissel. Finally Schidlof and Nissel were released, and the three of them were able to study with violin teacher Max Rostal, who taught them free of charge. It was through Rostal that they met cellist Martin Lovett (3 March 1927 – 29 April 2020), and in 1947 they formed the Brainin Quartet, which was renamed the Amadeus Quartet in 1948.

The group gave its first performance as the Amadeus Quartet at the Wigmore Hall in London on 10 January 1948, underwritten by British composer and conductor Imogen Holst. On 25 January 1983 the Quartet gave a 35th-anniversary concert in the same concert hall with a programme which included Beethoven&#x27;s String Quartet in C major, Op. 59 No. 3 (3rd Rasumovsky Quartet). Touring extensively, the Amadeus performed throughout Europe, Canada, the United States, Japan, and South America.

The quartet made some 200 recordings, among them the complete quartets of Ludwig van Beethoven, Johannes Brahms, and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. For concerts as well as recordings of string quintets (Mozart, Franz Schubert, Johannes Brahms, Anton Bruckner) and string sextets (Brahms) they regularly invited Cecil Aronowitz as second viola and William Pleeth as second cello. Though they emphasized a standard Classical and Romantic repertory, they also performed works by such 20th-century composers as Béla Bartók, and Benjamin Britten who wrote his last string quartet expressly for them, which they premiered after his death.

==Awards==
The Amadeus Quartet&#x27;s members were awarded numerous honors, including: 
*The Order of the British Empire, presented by the Queen.
*Doctorates from the Universities of London, York, and Caracas.
*The highest of all German awards, the Great Cross of Merit.
* Austrian Decoration for Science and Art.
*Grand Prix du Disque 

The quartet disbanded in 1987 upon the death of the violist Peter Schidlof. When the quartet was founded in 1947, the four members decided that, if one of the musicians either left the quartet or died, he would not be replaced and the quartet would disband. Forty years later, true to their word, the quartet disbanded upon Schidlof&#x27;s death (of a heart attack, at 65). Brainin died on 10 April 2005 and Nissel on 21 May 2008. The final member, Martin Lovett, died on 29 April 2020.

<text>USS &quot;Juneau&quot; (LPD-10), an , is the third ship of the United States Navy to be named for the capital of Alaska. The ship entered service on 12 July 1969, and participated in the Vietnam War, was command ship for the response to the &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; oil spill, transported troops to the Persian Gulf for Operation Desert Storm, and was part of the attempted US response to Cyclone Nargis. &quot;Juneau&quot; was decommissioned in 2008, and is part of the National Defense Reserve Fleet, and is currently berthed in Oahu, Hawaii waiting for disposal.

==Construction and launch==
Her keel was laid down by Lockheed Shipbuilding and Construction Company of Seattle, Washington, on 23 January 1965. She was launched on 12 February 1966 (sponsored by Mrs. Neva Egan, wife of William A. Egan, the Governor of Alaska), and commissioned on 12 July 1969.

==Operational history==
Throughout the 1970s, &quot;Juneau&quot; completed five deployments to the western Pacific, including eight trips into Vietnamese waters, earning five battle stars for its efforts in the Vietnam War. &quot;Juneau&quot; conducted the first AV-8A Harrier landing on a United States Pacific Fleet LPD in February 1976. On 4 July 1976, &quot;Juneau&quot; arrived in Juneau, Alaska with a complement of Marines from 1st Battalion, 5th Marines, 1st Marine Division as part of United States Bicentennial celebrations.

During the 1980s &quot;Juneau&quot; completed seven deployments. In April 1989, &quot;Juneau&quot; received emergency orders to Prince William Sound in support of the &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; oil spill clean up. She was the first naval vessel on station, and assumed the duties of command and control ship for Joint Task Force Alaska. She provided berthing, communications, transportation (both surface and air), food, medical and laundry services for over four hundred civilian cleanup workers. She was the host of Vice-President Dan Quayle&#x27;s visit to Prince William Sound, where he toured an oil soaked beach and then returned to &quot;Juneau&quot; and gave a speech that was televised nationwide.

After the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the initiation of Operation Desert Shield, &quot;Juneau&quot; sailed with twelve other ships of Amphibious Group Three in December 1990 to participate in Operation Desert Storm. Joining with ships from Amphibious Group Two, &quot;Juneau&quot; was a member of the largest amphibious task force since the United Nations assault on Incheon, South Korea in the Korean War. On 24 February 1991 &quot;Juneau&quot; off-loaded her equipment and ammunition in record time and landed her embarked troops at Ras Mishab, Saudi Arabia, whence they would assault Iraqi positions in southern Kuwait.

In May 1991, &quot;Juneau&quot; proceeded to Bangladesh to assist in Operation Sea Angel, providing relief after a disastrous cyclone.

During her 14th deployment in late 1992, &quot;Juneau&quot; was diverted to the coast of Somalia in support of Operation Restore Hope. Early on 9 December 1992, the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) performed an unopposed amphibious assault into the city of Mogadishu from &quot;Juneau&quot;, and . The embarked Marines ensured the security of shipments of food supplies to the people of Somalia.
&quot;Juneau&quot; was homeported in San Diego until 30 July 1999 when she relieved as part of the forward-deployed naval forces. From June to September 1999 &quot;Juneau&quot; participated in the first ship swap with her sister ship &quot;Dubuque&quot;, where each ship&#x27;s crew remained in their original home ports, allowing &quot;Dubuque&quot; to return to the homeport of San Diego, California. Since that date, &quot;Juneau&quot; has been homeported in Sasebo, Japan.

&quot;Juneau&quot; was deployed to East Timor as part of the Australian-led INTERFET peacekeeping taskforce from 28 to 31 January 2000.

During the 2008 Myanmar Cyclone Nargis crisis and the subsequent Operation Caring Response aid mission, &quot;Juneau&quot; (as part of the amphibious group, along with , and ), she stood by off Burma from 13 May to 5 June, waiting for the Myanmar junta government to permit US aid to its citizens. However, in early June, with permission still not forthcoming, it was decided to put the group back on its scheduled operations.

==Decommissioning==
&quot;Juneau&quot; swapped with her sister ship during the third quarter of fiscal year 2008. After the swap, the ship sailed to San Diego for decommissioning. The decommissioning took place 30 October 2008 after which the ship was moved to Hawaii and placed in the National Defense Reserve Fleet.

<text>The Chevrolet Camaro is a mid-size American automobile manufactured by Chevrolet, classified as a pony car. It first went on sale on September 29, 1966, for the 1967 model year and was designed to compete with the Ford Mustang. The Camaro shared its platform and major components with the Firebird, produced by General Motors&#x27; Pontiac division that was also introduced for the 1967 model year.

Four distinct generations of the Camaro were developed before production ended in 2002. The nameplate was revived on a concept car that evolved into the fifth-generation Camaro; production started on March 16, 2009.

Production of the sixth generation of the Camaro ended in December 2023, for the 2024 model year.

== Background ==
Before any official announcement, reports began running during April 1965 within the automotive press that Chevrolet was preparing a competitor to the Ford Mustang, code-named &quot;Panther&quot;. On June 21, 1966, around 200 automotive journalists received a telegram from General Motors stating, &quot;...please save noon of June 28 for important SEPAW meeting. Hope you can be on hand to help scratch a cat. Details will follow...(signed) John L. Cutter – Chevrolet public relations – SEPAW secretary.&quot; The following day, the same journalists received another General Motors telegram stating, &quot;Society for the Eradication of Panthers from the Automotive World will hold first and last meeting on June 28...(signed) John L. Cutter – Chevrolet public relations SEPAW secretary.&quot; These telegrams puzzled automotive journalists.

On June 28, 1966, General Motors held a live press conference in Detroit&#x27;s Statler-Hilton Hotel. It was the first time fourteen cities were connected in real time for a press conference call via telephone lines. Chevrolet general manager Pete Estes started the news conference by stating that all attendees of the conference were charter members of the Society for the Elimination of Panthers from the Automotive World and that this would be the first and last meeting of SEPAW. Estes then announced a new car line, project designation &quot;XP-836&quot;, with a name that Chevrolet chose in keeping with other car names beginning with the letter &quot;C&quot; such as the Corvair, Chevelle, Chevy II, and Corvette. He claimed the name &quot;suggests the comradeship of good friends as a personal car should be to its owner&quot; and that &quot;to us, the name means just what we think the car will do... go.&quot; The &quot;Camaro&quot; name was then unveiled. Automotive press asked Chevrolet product managers, &quot;what is a Camaro?&quot; and were told it was &quot;a small, vicious animal that eats Mustangs,&quot; an apparent reference to the Ford Mustang, which created and dominated the pony car market GM was entering.

According to the book &quot;The Complete Book of Camaro: Every Model Since 1967&quot;, the name &quot;Camaro&quot; was conceived by Chevrolet merchandising manager Bob Lund and General Motors vice president Ed Rollett, while they were reading the book &quot;Heath&#x27;s French and English Dictionary&quot; by James Boïelle and by de V. Payen-Payne printed in 1936. In the book &quot;The Complete Book of Camaro&quot;, it states that Mr. Lund and Mr. Rollett found the word &quot;camaro&quot; in the French-English dictionary was slang, to mean &quot;friend, pal, or comrade&quot;. The article further repeated Estes&#x27;s statement of what the word &quot;camaro&quot; was meant to imply, that the car&#x27;s name &quot;suggests the comradeship of good friends, as a personal car should be to its owner&quot;. The accepted French word with the closest meaning is &quot;camarade,&quot; from which the English word &quot;comrade&quot; is derived.

The Camaro was first shown at a press preview in Detroit on September 12, 1966, and later in Los Angeles on September 19, 1966. The public introduction of the new model was on September 26, 1966. The Camaro officially went on sale in dealerships on September 29, 1966, for the 1967 model year.

== First generation (1967–1969) ==

The first-generation Camaro debuted in September 1966. It was produced for the 1967 through 1969 model years on a new rear-wheel drive GM F-body platform as a two-door 2+2 in hardtop coupé and convertible models. The base engine was a inline-6, with a straight-six or , , , , and V8s available as options.

Concerned with the runaway success of the Ford Mustang, Chevrolet executives realized that the sporty version of their compact rear-engine Corvair, the Monza, would not be able to generate the sales volume of the Mustang because of limitations with that layout (including its inability to share the whole range of Chevrolet engines) and declining sales, the latter partly owing to the negative publicity from Ralph Nader&#x27;s book &quot;Unsafe at Any Speed&quot;. Therefore, the Camaro was touted for its conventional rear-drive, front-engine configuration, and layout, the same as the Mustang. In addition, the Camaro could borrow parts from the existing Chevy Nova the way the Mustang did from the Ford Falcon. The first-generation Camaro lasted until the 1969 model year and eventually inspired the design of the new retro fifth-generation Camaro.

The first-generation was available in &quot;Super Sport&quot;, &quot;Rally Sport&quot;, and beginning in December 1966 the high-performance Z/28, models. It came with stripes on the hood and trunk (that could be deleted at no charge), styled rally road wheels, and a special V8 engine that had been developed for Trans-Am Series racing.

== Second generation (1970–1981) ==

Introduced on February 26, 1970, the second-generation Camaro was produced through the 1981 model year, with cosmetic changes made for the 1974 and 1978 model years. The car was heavily restyled and became larger and wider with the new styling. Based on the F-body platform, the new Camaro was similar to its predecessor. It had a unibody structure, a front subframe, an A-arm front suspension, and leaf springs suspending a solid rear axle. The 1980 and 1981 Z28 models included an air induction hood scoop with an intake door that opened under full throttle. The RS SS package was dropped in 1972 and reintroduced in 1996.

&quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; included the 1971 SS350 as one of the 10 best cars in the world in August 1971.

== Third generation (1982–1992) ==

The third-generation Camaro was produced from 1981 (for the 1982 model year) until 1992. These were the first Camaros to offer modern fuel injection, Turbo-Hydramatic 700R4 four-speed automatic transmissions, five-speed manual transmissions, 14-, 15- or 16-inch road wheels, a standard OHV 4-cylinder engine, and hatchback bodies. The cars were nearly lighter than the second-generation model. The IROC-Z was introduced in 1985 and continued through 1990.

National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) Regulations required a CHMSL (Center High Mounted Stop Lamp) starting with the 1986 model year. For 1986, the new brake light was located on the exterior of the upper center area of the back hatch glass. Additionally, the 2.5 L Iron Duke pushrod 4-cylinder engine was dropped, and all base models now came with the 2.8 L V6 (OHV). For 1987 and later, the CHMSL was either mounted inside the upper hatch glass or integrated into a rear spoiler (if equipped). In 1985, the small block V8 was available with indirect injection called &quot;tuned port injection&quot; (TPI). In 1987, the L98 V8 engine became a regular option on the IROC-Z, paired with an automatic transmission only. The convertible body style returned in 1987 after being last produced in 1969, and all models came with a unique &quot;20th Anniversary Commemorative Edition&quot; leather map pocket. The 1992 models offered a &quot;25th Anniversary Heritage Package&quot; with stripes and a unique spoiler plaque. In 1988, the 1LE performance package was introduced, optional on street models and for showroom stock racing in the U.S. and Canada. The B4C, or &quot;police&quot; package, was made available in 1991. This created a Z28 in more subtle RS styling.

== Fourth generation (1993–2002) ==

The fourth-generation Camaro debuted in 1993 on an updated F-body platform. It retained the same characteristics since its introduction in 1967: a coupé body style with 2+2 seating (with an optional T-top roof) or convertible (reintroduced in 1994), rear-wheel drive, pushrod 6-cylinder, and V8 engines. The standard engine from 1993 through 1995 was a 3.4 L V6, then a 3.8 L V6 was introduced in 1995. A 350 MPFI (LT1) Small Block V-8 engine, which was introduced in the Corvette in 1992, was standard in the Z28. Optional equipment included all-speed traction control and a new six-speed T-56 manual transmission; the 4L60E 4-speed automatic transmission was standard on the Z28. The automatic transmission was optional on the V6 models, which came with a 5-speed manual. Anti-lock brakes were standard equipment on all Camaros.

A limited quantity of the SS version (1996-1997) came with the LT4 small block engine from the Corvette, although most were equipped with the LT1 version. The 1997 model year included a revised interior, and the 1998 models included exterior styling changes and a switch to GM&#x27;s aluminum block LS1 used in the Corvette C5. In 1998, the 5.7 L LS1 was the first all-aluminum engine offered in a Camaro since the 1969 ZL-1 and was rated at . The SS versions (1998-2002) received slightly improved exhaust and intake systems, bigger wheels and tires, a slightly revised suspension for improved handling and grip while retaining ride comfort, an arc-shaped rear wing for downforce, and different gearing ratios for faster acceleration, over the Z28 models. Chevrolet offered a 35th-anniversary edition for the 2002 model year.

Production of the F-Body platform was discontinued due to slowing sales, a deteriorating market for sports coupés, and plant overcapacity, but an entirely new platform went on sale in 2009. The B4C Special Service Package for police agencies was carried over from the third-generation and marketed between 1993 and 2002.

== Fifth generation (2010–2015) ==

The Camaro received a complete redesign and new platform in 2009 for the 2010 model year and fifth generation. Based on the 2006 Camaro Concept and 2007 Camaro Convertible Concept, production of the fifth-generation Camaro was approved on August 10, 2006. The Oshawa Car Assembly plant in the city of Oshawa, Ontario, Canada, began producing the new Camaro which went on sale in spring of 2009 as a 2010 model year vehicle.

The new body used styling cues from the 1969 Camaro, including the grille, roof styling, quarter windows, and side trim. Unlike the 1969 model and the 2006 concept, the production model&#x27;s quarter windows were fixed and hid a thick B-pillar behind the glass.

Following the development of the Zeta architecture and because of its position as the GM global center of RWD development, Holden in Australia led the final design, engineering, and development of the Camaro. Production of the coupé began on March 16, 2009, in LS, LT, and SS trim levels. LS and LT models include a V6 producing for the 2010 and 2011 models mated to either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic with manual shift. The SS features the LS3 V8 producing and is paired with a 6-speed manual. The automatic SS has the L99 V8 rated at . The RS appearance package available on the LT and SS featured 20-inch wheels with a darker gray tone, halo rings around xenon headlamps, a unique spoiler, and red RS or SS badges.

In addition to the original 2012 Camaro LS model. Chevrolet offered a 2LS model with a 2.92 rear axle ratio that increased fuel economy. The base engine 2012 model had a higher redline than previous V6 models, now reaching 7200 rpm. Almost all 2LS models had various styles of rear spoilers.

On April 1, 2010, the Camaro was named the World Car Design of the Year at the World Car of the Year Awards.

In late January 2011, the production of the 2011 Camaro Convertibles started.

In November 2011, the export version (excluding the Japanese version) of the Camaro was introduced after a two-year delay. The delay was due to unexpected domestic demand.

Although not in continuous production for the entire period, the 2012 model year marked the 45th anniversary of the Camaro, and this was commemorated with a special edition model. For 2012, the V6 was updated to a 3.6 L &quot;LFX&quot; engine producing . The SS model received an upgrade to the suspension system. All models received the RS spoiler and taillight details, steering wheel-mounted volume and radio controls, and Bluetooth connectivity controls as standard. The 2012 ZL1 Camaro included a 6.2 L LSA supercharged V8 producing . This engine was first used in the Cadillac CTS-V for the 2009 model year. Other features included a 2-stage exhaust, the addition of suede seats, steering wheel, and shift knob, as well as ZL1-exclusive 20-inch aluminum wheels. In 2012, Chevrolet unveiled the production of the 2013 Camaro ZL1 Convertible.

The 2014 Camaro was unveiled at the 2013 New York Auto Show, with a refreshed body style and the return of a Z/28 model. Upgrades included a slimmer grille along with a larger lower fascia and new fog lights along with taillights that took styling cues from the original first-generation Camaro. The RS appearance package incorporates LEDs into both the headlights and taillights. The Z/28 model features a high-performance 7.0 L LS7 V8 engine that produces .
== Sixth generation (2016–2024) ==

On May 16, 2015, Chevrolet introduced the sixth generation Camaro at Belle Isle Park in Detroit for the 2016 model year. The launch, complete with previous generation Camaros on display, coincided with the vehicle&#x27;s 50th birthday.

Using the GM Alpha platform shared with the Cadillac ATS, and manufactured at Lansing Grand River Assembly in Michigan, sales of the sixth generation Camaro began in late 2015, starting with LT and SS models.

The 2016 Camaro weighed less than its predecessor. Over 70% of the sixth generation&#x27;s architectural components are unique to the car and are not shared with any other GM product.

&quot;Motor Trend&quot; named the 2016 Camaro its &quot;Car of the Year&quot;.

Early production cars have three engine versions: a 2.0 L turbo-charged inline-four producing , a new 3.6 L V6 making , while the SS model features the 6.2 L LT1 V8 with ; the ZL1 model will use a supercharged LT4 based on the Corvette Z06. The transmissions are either a six-speed manual or an eight-speed automatic (the 2017 ZL1 will share the six-speed manual but have an optional ten-speed automatic transmission with paddle shift).

For the 2017 model year, the 1LE performance package returned to the Camaro. The package built off the success of the previous-generation 1LE, offering increased handling and track performance. In response to customer demand, Chevrolet offered two 1LE packages for V6 and V8 models, each visually distinguished with a satin black vinyl-wrapped hood and specific wheels. This prevents the sun from glaring into the driver&#x27;s view when racing on a track. The 2017 ZL1 Camaro has a top speed of 198 mph, and a Nürburgring Nordschleife lap time of 7:29.60.

Alongside the 1LE package, Chevrolet launched the 50th Anniversary Edition of the Camaro for the 2017 model year. This special edition commemorated the car’s legacy with unique features both inside and out. The Nightfall Gray Metallic exterior color (with a black top on convertible models) and exclusive 20-inch 50th Anniversary wheels set it apart. The edition also included specific 50th Anniversary stripes, badges, a unique grille with satin chrome accents, and a body-colored front splitter. Inside, the car featured a black leather interior with suede inserts, orange accent stitching, and special treatments on the instrument panel, seatbacks, steering wheel, and illuminated sill plates. Available on the 2LT and 2SS coupe and convertible models, this edition carried the GM RPO code H50.

For the 2018 model year, Chevrolet introduced the ZL1 1LE package for the Camaro. The new package tested three seconds faster around General Motors&#x27; Milford Road Course than the next-fastest ZL1 Camaro. The ZL1 1LE performance package introduces improved aerodynamics, a new racing-inspired adjustable suspension, and new lightweight forged aluminum wheels with Goodyear Eagle F1 Supercar 3R tires created especially for the ZL1 1LE. Overall, the new performance package reduces the car&#x27;s weight by over the ZL1. The ZL1 1LE shares the ZL1&#x27;s supercharged LT4 engine paired with a six-speed manual transmission with Active Rev Match. The 2018 ZL1 1LE, a manual transmission model driven by Camaro ride and handling engineer Bill Wise, clocked a Nurburgring Nordschleife time of 7:16.04, which was a substantial 13.56 seconds faster than the previous model year&#x27;s non-1LE ZL1 with automatic transmission.

The Camaro received a facelift for the 2019 model year, with the LS, LT, and SS models gaining a new set of LED headlights and revised fascia designs. The SS also received these upgrades and a new &quot;polished black grille&quot;, which was received negatively. The rear fascia featured new split taillights colored red on the LS and LT and a unique clear lens on the SS and ZL1. The ZL1&#x27;s front end remained unchanged, but gained a new set of spoilers. Four color choices, two blues, one gray, and one yellow, were removed and replaced with two new shades of gray and a darker shade of blue, Riverside Blue Metallic. Old LPO trim accessories were discontinued and replaced with either standard features or updated options. The interior received Chevrolet&#x27;s then-new &quot;Infotainment 3&quot; system over their aging MyLink, with a standard backup camera to meet updated US Federal regulations. The SS trim was available with a new 10-speed transmission for the V8. The LS Convertible was discontinued and the LT was offered with a new 3LT coupe and convertible combo. Some trim packages previously only for the SS were also made available for the LT. For the ZL1 1LE, the Turbo I4 was revised to have a higher power output and gained a Track Performance Package; the remainder was unchanged. The update was met with overall acclaim, with emphasis on driving but certain news outlets were particularly harsh on the SS&#x27; updated design, with Motor Trend&#x27;s Christian Seabaugh calling it &quot;botched plastic surgery&quot; and even going so far to suggest that Chevrolet dock the design staff&#x27;s pay to cover the engineering staff&#x27;s raise.

The 2020 model year facelift fixed the stylistic criticisms of the 2019 model year by redesigning the front grille to have a body-colored crossbar, moving the bow-tie logo to the upper grille, and reshaping the front headlights.

== Racing ==

The Camaro was one of the vehicles in the SCCA-sanctioned Trans-Am Series. Chevrolet worked with Roger Penske to operate their unofficially factory-backed Trans Am team, winning the title in 1968 and 1969 with Mark Donohue. Jim Hall&#x27;s Chaparral team replaced Penske for the 1970 season.

Bob Jane won both the 1971 and 1972 Australian Touring Car Championships at the wheel of a Camaro.

The Camaro was the official car used in the International Race of Champions starting in 1975 and continuing twelve years until 1989. It was the first American car of the series, succeeding the Porsche Carrera RSR.

Camaros compete in drag racing, having won many championships, and can be currently found in several series from the National Hot Rod Association, International Hot Rod Association, and United States Hot Rod Association. Road racing Camaros can currently be found in the Sports Car Club of America&#x27;s American Sedan series. They have also been used in the Swedish Camaro Cup series since 1975.

The Camaro was the Indianapolis 500 Pace Car in 1967, 1969, 1982, 1993, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2014, and 2016. The Camaro also paced races at Daytona, Watkins Glen, Mosport in Canada, and Charlotte Motor Speedway.

The Camaro was also a regular in the IMSA GT Series.

The fifth-generation Camaro took to the tracks in 2010 in the GT class of the Grand Am Road Racing Championship. Stevenson Motorsports announced that it was seeking to run a two-car team of Pratt &amp; Miller built cars, based on the same spaceframe as the Pontiac GXP-R. The team also competed with Camaros in the Grand Sports class of the Grand-Am&#x27;s Continental Tire Challenge.

Camaro-styled cars also race in the NASCAR Xfinity Series, with all Chevrolet teams using the body since 2013.

The Camaro ZL1 was introduced in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series in 2018, replacing the discontinued Chevrolet SS. On February 18, 2018, Austin Dillon won the Daytona 500 in the ZL1&#x27;s debut. In the 2020 season, Chase Elliott won the Camaro&#x27;s first NASCAR Championship in the last race of the season.

In the Australian 2023 Supercars Championship, the sixth generation Camaro ZL1 replaced the Holden Commodore ZB as the General Motors representative.

== Sales ==


== In popular culture ==
General Motors has made product placement, or embedded marketing, deals for the Chevrolet Camaro in numerous media.

The vehicle mode of the fictional character Bumblebee in the 2007 film, &quot;Transformers&quot;, is first depicted as a 1976 Camaro and later a fifth-generation concept variant. A modified fifth-generation Camaro reprises the role of Bumblebee in the sequels, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. Bumblebee takes on the form of a modified 1967 Camaro in &quot;&quot;, and later a sixth-generation concept Camaro. He also returns as a modified 2016 Camaro in &quot;&quot;.

<doc id="234494" wikidata="Q63650798" url="?curid=234494" title="Arne Anka">
<text>Arne Anka is a Swedish comic strip drawn by Charlie Christensen from 1983 to 1995 and 2006 and forward. The title character is inspired by Donald Duck (who is called &quot;Kalle Anka&quot; in Swedish). The likeness with Donald Duck is only feather deep, however; the comics often take place at a bar, &quot;Zeke&#x27;s&quot;, where Arne gets drunk while he cynically thinks about and discusses life. This usually happens in the company of his friend, &quot;Krille Krokodil&quot; (&quot;Krille Crocodile&quot;). In other situations, Arne is found walking, with friends or alone, and occasionally he is found in a completely different setting (albeit with the same group of friends), like ancient Rome or 18th century Paris. Always, however, he comments on life and (especially Swedish) society with sharp wit.

Some distinct features about Arne Anka are his deep love for Swedish poetry and literature, his miserable financial situation, his excessive consumption of alcohol, and his enthusiasm towards women - even though he has very little luck with any such connections.

Charlie Christensen uses his friends as inspiration for the characters and stories in Arne Anka. One of his friends has said that you sometimes notice that Charlie Christensen gets a particular look and then a few weeks later you read what you just said in an Arne Anka strip.

In 1997, a few pages were translated to English in connection with an exhibition of Nordic comics in France, and the publication of an English-language anthology. In this translation, the character was given the name &quot;Arnie the Duck&quot;.

For Joachim Trier&#x27;s 2021 Norwegian film The Worst Person in the World, Charlie Christensen was hired to do the comic &quot;Gaupe&quot; (roughly &quot;Lynxie&quot;) in an Arne Anka-inspired style. 

==Disney lawsuit threat==
In 1990, the Nordic division of the Walt Disney Company ordered Christensen&#x27;s publisher to cease and desist all publication of Arne Anka, due to the character&#x27;s resemblance to Donald Duck, and threatened to sue if they didn&#x27;t. To get around this, Christensen came up with a two-part plan; first, he had Arne undergo plastic surgery to have his beak reshaped so that he no longer looked like a duck, and changed his name to Arne X. Then, after almost a year of hearing other characters (and some readers) tell him that he looked better before, Arne buys a fake duck beak to wear over his altered beak so he can look like his former self, reasoning that he could always remove the false beak if any of Disney&#x27;s lawyers confronted him. Thus, with the exception of a thin line on the back of his head to represent the elastic band holding his new beak on, his appearance was the same as before.

As a result of all this, the character&#x27;s popularity soared, as the readers saw him as a hero for standing up to an enormous American corporation; Arne became a symbol of Swedish pride and defiance.

== Theater play ==
In 1995, Arne Anka was produced as a play at Stockholm City Theatre (Stockholms Stadsteater). The play was written by Christensen himself, and it was called &quot;Arne Anka - en afton på Zekes&quot; (&quot;Arne Anka - an evening at Zeke&#x27;s&quot;), starring Robert Gustafsson as Arne.

==History==

===1970s===
On 22 January 1971, &quot;Shreveport&quot; departed Puget Sound for her homeport, Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia, where she arrived on 21 February. Between 9 March and 9 April 1971, the amphibious transport dock underwent shakedown training at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and, from 16 June to 4 August, she carried 375 midshipmen from the United States Naval Academy on a training cruise to Northern Europe. After post shakedown repairs from 6 October to 24 November 1971, she sailed for the Caribbean Sea, where she participated in landing exercises during the first part of 1972. On 12 June, the ship again sailed on a midshipman training cruise to Northern Europe, visiting the Azores; Aalborg, Denmark; Portsmouth, England; and Le Havre, France; before returning to Norfolk, on 3 August. During the rest of 1972, &quot;Shreveport&quot; conducted amphibious training exercises off the coasts of Virginia, North Carolina, and Florida.

&quot;Shreveport&quot;, with Amphibious Squadron 2, departed Norfolk on 4 January 1973 for her first tour of duty with the United States Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea. The squadron stopped at Morehead City, North Carolina, and embarked elements of the Sixth Marines (BLT 1/6) before it proceeded to Rota, Spain, where the vessel was assigned to CTF 61. The task force departed Rota on 16 January, called at Cannes, France, on 18 January, and was underway for Monte Romano, Italy, on 22 January. During her six-month deployment, &quot;Shreveport&quot; also visited ports in Italy, Greece, Crete, and Turkey before returning to Morehead City on 2 July. The Marines were offloaded, and the ship continued to Norfolk that afternoon.

&quot;Shreveport&quot; operated in the Norfolk area until February 1974 when she sailed, with PhibRon 2, for operations in the Caribbean. She returned to her home port on 19 March. The ship made another trip south to the Panama Canal area that lasted from 18 April to 4 June. On 24 June, &quot;Shreveport&quot; sailed for Rotterdam and another deployment with the Sixth Fleet.

Throughout 1974 and half of 1975, &quot;Shreveport&quot; was the flagship of the Caribbean Amphibious Ready Group and participated in various fleet exercises with the Marine Corps, occasionally also with South American Forces. In July 1975, she deployed back to the Mediterranean where she participated in a major NATO exercise involving British, Turkish and U.S. navies. During the return trip to Norfolk in February 1976, the ship&#x27;s flag bridge was destroyed by a wave off Cape Hatteras. Thereafter &quot;Shreveport&quot; returned to fleet exercises in the Caribbean until September 1979 when she began another Mediterranean deployment where she completed four major amphibious operations with various European allies.

As a result of this operation, she received the Navy Unit Commendation and the Navy Expeditionary Medal. In July 1984, she broke the world record for transiting the Suez Canal. In late 1984, she received the Meritorious Unit Commendation for conducting mine clearing operations in the Red Sea in support of Operation Intense Look. Later in the deployment, she was called to action off the Lebanese coast. Following the bombing of the US Embassy in Beirut, &quot;Shreveport&quot; provided critical medical evacuation and logistics support services. After making port calls in Marseille, France, and Malaga and Rota, Spain, she returned to Norfolk.

During a Mediterranean deployment in November 1993, &quot;Shreveport&quot; was assigned to Mogadishu, Somalia in support of Operation Restore Hope.

From 1994 and 1995 saw &quot;Shreveport&quot; participating in Operation Provide Promise in the Adriatic Sea by flying video reconnaissance missions over Bosnia-Herzegovina utilizing the Pioneer UAV. During this time, she also served in the first amphibious Partnership for Peace exercise in Bulgaria.

From December 1995 to February 1996, &quot;Shreveport&quot; participated in Operations Deny Flight, Provide Promise, and Joint/Decisive Endeavor in the Adriatic sea. On 3 October 1997, &quot;Shreveport&quot; deployed for yet another Mediterranean cruise.

While operating in the Black Sea, &quot;Shreveport&quot; conducted a Change of Command ceremony in Constanţa, Romania on 11 December 1997. In early February 1998, she was called away from her original schedule and spent the remainder of the deployment operating in the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Southern Watch.

<text>USS &quot;Nashville&quot; (LPD-13), was an and the third ship of the United States Navy to be named for the capital city of Tennessee. Her keel was laid down on 14 March 1966 by the Lockheed Shipbuilding and Construction Company of Seattle, Washington. She was launched on 7 October 1967 sponsored by Mrs. Roy L. Johnson, and commissioned at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington, on 14 February 1970.

==History==
&quot;Nashville&quot; various assignments have included four Caribbean Amphibious Ready Groups, eight Mediterranean Groups, two Persian Gulf Groups, a Mine Countermeasure Task Group, North Atlantic Treaty Organization Operations and training assignments with Fleet Marine Force Atlantic.

The ship remained in Amphibious Squadron 2 in 1977. She served as squadron flagship from 1 January through 11 March; 29 April through 21 May; and 10 August through 31 December 1977. In addition, she served as flagship for Commander Combined Amphibious Task Force (Commander Task Force 401), Commander Combined Landing Force, and Commander Task Force 61 (Commander Amphibious Squadron 2) during NATO Exercise Dawn Patrol &#x27;77.

&quot;Nashville&quot; provided support during 8 June 1995 rescue of pilot Capt. Scott O&#x27;Grady, who was shot down over Bosnia on 2 June 1995 by an SA-6 mobile launcher and forced to eject from his F-16C into hostile territory.

In 2003, she deployed as part of the Iwo Jima Amphibious Ready Group with the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit.

On 16 and 17 January 2006, she was the first vessel to receive the landing of an unmanned robotic RQ-8A Fire Scout helicopter.

In July 2006, she was sent to Lebanon as part of the Expeditionary Strike Group transporting the 24th MEU to assist with the evacuation of U.S. nationals from the country, after a conflict erupted between the Israeli military and Hezbollah militants. On 20 July 2006, it landed the first Marines on Lebanese soil since 1982. The &quot;Nashville&quot; is featured in an episode of the television program &quot;Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations&quot;, as it evacuated Americans (including Bourdain and his production crew) from Beirut. The episode was nominated for an Emmy Award.
The USS &quot;Nashville&quot; was decommissioned on 30 September 2009 at Naval Station Norfolk and moved to the Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where it was laid up. Navy officials stated the ship was too costly to maintain and was unable to match the efficiency of newer vessels.

On 22 March 2022, &quot;Nashville&quot; was removed from the Philadelphia NIMSF and began its journey to Brownsville, Texas, where it will be scrapped. It arrived in Brownsville on 8 April 2022.

==Possible sale to India==
According to an Indian news source, the Indian Navy may bid to acquire the &quot;Nashville&quot;, but , India had decided not to move forward with the deal. The &quot;Nashville&quot; is of the same class as the which was previously sold to India and is now the .

<text>The Beaux Arts Trio was a noted piano trio, celebrated for their vivacity, emotional depth and wide-ranging repertoire. They made their debut on 13 July 1955, at the Berkshire Music Festival, Lenox, Massachusetts, United States, known today as the Tanglewood Music Center. Their final American concert was held at Tanglewood on 21 August 2008. It was webcast live and archived on NPR Music. Their final concert was in Lucerne, Switzerland, on 6 September 2008.

The Beaux Arts Trio recorded the entire standard piano trio repertoire. In 2005, the trio celebrated its 50th anniversary with two special CD issues, one featuring their most popular releases through their long years of recording (released by Philips Records), and the other an anniversary collection of new music (released by Warner Records).

Throughout its existence, the trio was held together by founding pianist Menahem Pressler. The original members of the trio when it was founded in 1955 were as follows:

* piano: Menahem Pressler
* violin: Daniel Guilet
* cello: Bernard Greenhouse

The violin and cello members changed on a number of occasions, with later members including the following:

* violin: Isidore Cohen (1968–1992; formerly second violinist of the Juilliard String Quartet), Ida Kavafian (1992–1998), Yung Uck Kim (1998–2002), Daniel Hope (2002–2008)
* cello: Peter Wiley (1987–1998, he then moved to Guarneri Quartet), Antonio Meneses (1998–2008)

In July 2015, Decca Classics released a 60-CD boxed set to mark their 60th anniversary.

<doc id="234500" wikidata="Q189066" url="?curid=234500" title="Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe">
<text>The Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe (TCE; commonly referred to as the European Constitution or as the Constitutional Treaty) was an unratified international treaty intended to create a consolidated constitution for the European Union (EU). It would have replaced the existing European Union treaties with a single text, given legal force to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and expanded qualified majority voting into policy areas which had previously been decided by unanimity among member states.

The Treaty was signed on 29 October 2004 by representatives of the then 25 member states of the European Union. It was later ratified by 18 member states, which included referendums endorsing it in Spain and Luxembourg. However, the rejection of the document by French and Dutch voters in May and June 2005 brought the ratification process to an end.

Following a period of reflection, the Treaty of Lisbon was created to replace the Constitutional Treaty. This contained many of the changes that were originally placed in the Constitutional Treaty but, instead of repealing and replacing the existing treaties, simply amended them and abandoned the idea of a single codified constitution. Signed on 13 December 2007, the Lisbon Treaty entered into force on 1 December 2009.

==History==

===Drafting===
The drafting of the European Constitution began in a call for a new debate on the future of Europe, made at the Laeken European Council in December 2001. A European Convention was founded shortly afterward; this was chaired by former French President Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing and composed of two Members of Parliament (generally one from the governing majority and one from the opposition) of each Member State and applicant state, 16 MEPs, two members of the European Commission and a representative from each government. It met in public. Giscard d&#x27;Estaing proposed to draft a Constitution. Romano Prodi, the President of the European Commission, backed a draft text, termed the &#x27;Penelope Project&#x27;, which contained a deeper integration of the countries and a clearer institutional model.

After protracted negotiations in the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) during the Italian presidency, disputes arose over the proposed framework for qualified majority voting: the final text of the TCE was settled in June 2004 under the Irish presidency.

===Mention of Christianity in the preamble===
Several countries urged that the preamble of the Constitution include a reference to Christianity. Among these were Italy, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Portugal, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia, which in May 2004 sent a letter to the Irish Presidency, saying &quot;the governments of those countries consider as a priority the recognition of the Christian tradition in the Preamble&quot; and noting that the list of signatories was not exhaustive as they hoped other countries would join their initiative. The Greek government likewise supported a reference to Christianity.

The strongest opponents of any reference to Christianity were France and Belgium. Other countries opposing such a reference were Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Slovenia, and Cyprus. Among other nations, Spain originally supported the inclusion of a reference to Christianity, but the incoming Zapatero government reversed the stance of its predecessor.

Eventually the agreed-upon Constitution made no explicit references to Christianity, only mentioning the &quot;cultural, religious and humanist inheritance of Europe&quot;. This decision caused disappointment in the Vatican, but satisfaction from candidate state Turkey.

===Signing===

The &quot;Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe&quot; was signed in Rome on 29 October 2004 by 53 senior political figures from the 25 member states of the European Union. In most cases heads of state designated plenipotentiaries to sign the treaty, but some presidents also signed on behalf of states which were republics. Most designated plenipotentiaries were prime ministers and foreign ministers.

===Ratification===
On 12 January 2005 the European Parliament voted a legally non-binding resolution in support of the Constitution by 500 votes in favour to 137 votes against, with 40 abstentions.

Before an EU treaty can enter into force, it must be ratified by all member states. Ratification takes different forms in each country, depending on its traditions, constitutional arrangements and political processes. Most member states ratify EU treaties following parliamentary votes, while some — notably Ireland and Denmark — sometimes hold referendums, in Ireland&#x27;s case where the treaty requires a constitutional amendment, for all amendments have to be approved by referendum. As a reaction to what was seen as the novel nature of the Constitution, many advocates and opponents of the Constitution argued that it should be subjected to referendums across the European Union.

On 20 April 2004, the then British prime minister Tony Blair unexpectedly announced an intention to hold a referendum, a proposal which he had previously rejected. A further seven member states announced or had already announced that they would hold referendums on the Constitution, these being Denmark, France, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain and Portugal.

Spain was the first country to hold a referendum on the Constitution. On 20 February 2005, Spanish voters backed the treaty with 76% voting in favour to 24% against, on a turnout of 43%.

On 29 May 2005, the French people rejected the Constitution by a margin of 55% to 45% on a turnout of 69%. On 1 June, the Dutch people rejected the constitution by a margin of 61% to 39% on a turnout of 62%.

Notwithstanding the rejection in France and the Netherlands, Luxembourg held a referendum on 10 July 2005 approving the Constitution by 57% to 43%. It was the last referendum to be held on the Constitution, for all of the other member states that had proposed to hold referendums cancelled them.

===Post-rejection===
After the French and Dutch referendum results, European leaders decided to hold a &quot;period of reflection&quot; on what to do next. As part of this reflection period, a group of Politicians and Officials was set up to consider possible courses of action. This group of high-level European politicians – former prime ministers, ministers and members of the European Commission – first met on 30 September 2006 in Rome.

On 4 June 2007, this group, known as the Amato Group, presented its report. They proposed to establish a new Inter-Governmental Conference with a view to writing a new treaty which would rewrite the Maastricht Treaty, amend the Treaty of Rome and give the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union a legally binding status. The new treaty would be based on the first and fourth parts of the Constitution, the rest of the Constitution&#x27;s changes being achieved through amendments to the Treaty of Rome.

In the June 2007 European summit meeting, member states agreed to abandon the constitution and to amend the existing treaties, which would remain in force. They also agreed a detailed mandate for a new intergovernmental conference to negotiate a new treaty containing such amendments to the existing treaties (primarily the Treaty of Rome and the Treaty of Maastricht). These negotiations were completed by the end of the year. The new treaty, which had previously been referred to as the &quot;Reform Treaty&quot;, became the Lisbon Treaty on its signing in Lisbon on 13 December 2007.

===National processes at a glance===
==Content==
===Institutional structure===
Under the TCE, the Council of the European Union would have been formally renamed the &quot;Council of Ministers&quot;, which is already its informal title. The &quot;General Affairs Council&quot; would have been formally split from the &quot;Foreign Affairs Council&quot;, which had informally held meetings separately since June 2002.

The TCE proposed the formal recognition of a flag, an anthem and a motto for the Union, although none of them were new.

===Conferral, subsidiarity, proportionality===
The TCE would have reiterated several key principles of how the Union functions:

* the principle of conferral: that all EU competences are conferred on it voluntarily by member states;
* the principle of subsidiarity: that governmental decisions should be taken at the lowest level possible while still remaining effective;
* the principle of proportionality: that the EU may only act exactly to the extent that is needed to achieve its objectives;
* the primacy of EU law: in areas where member states have made legally binding agreements at EU level, they may not then pass national laws incompatible with those EU laws.

The TCE would have specified that the EU is a union of member states, and that all its competences (areas of responsibility) are voluntarily conferred on it by its member states according to the principle of conferral. The EU would have no competences by right, and thus any areas of policy not explicitly specified in the Constitution would have remained the domain of the sovereign member states (notwithstanding the ‘flexibility clause&#x27;).

According to the TCE, the EU may act (i.e. make laws) only where its member states agree unanimously that actions by individual countries would be insufficient. This is the principle of subsidiarity and is based on the legal and political principle that governmental decisions should be taken as close to the people as possible while still remaining effective. It is a main argument against claims that Europe limits national sovereignty, but critics say that it is a principle to which lip service only is paid and, in practice, the reach of the EU has been increasingly ambitious.

===Primacy of Union law===
Amongst European countries, the European Court of Justice has consistently ruled since 1964 that EU law has primacy over the laws of member states in the areas where member states allow it to legislate. National law that is incompatible with an agreement already made at European level is deemed to be &#x27;disapplied&#x27; when questions arise in courts. This controversial and fundamental principle of European Community law was first recognised in the case of &quot;Van Gend en Loos&quot; in 1963 which was followed in &quot;Costa v. ENEL&quot; in 1964.

=== Judicial protection and fundamental rights ===
The TCE would have maintained the role of the Court of Justice of the European Union (articles III-353 et seq.).

It would further have rendered the (at that point) non-binding Charter of Fundamental Rights legally binding. Unlike the Treaty of Lisbon, it incorporated the text of the Charter in the Treaty itself (see Part II of the TCE). This included various adjustments to the Charter as promulgated in 2000, including granting persuasive value to the Explanations to the Charter (see article II-112(7) and Declaration 12 to the TCE).

This would continue to exist alongside the protection of fundamental rights as general principles of EU law (article (I-9(3) TCE). Further, article I-9(2) TCE required the EU to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights.

===Common values of the Union&#x27;s member states===
As stated in and , the Union is open to all European States that respect the member states&#x27; common values, namely:
* human dignity
* freedom
* democracy
* equality
* the rule of law
* respect for human rights
* minority rights.

Member states also declare that the following principles prevail in their society:
* pluralism
* non-discrimination
* tolerance
* justice
* solidarity
* equality of the sexes.

Some of these provisions would have been codified for the first time in the TCE.

===Aims of the Union===
The aims of the EU were stated to be ():
* promotion of peace, its values and the well-being of its people.
* maintenance of freedom, security and justice without internal borders, and an internal market where competition is free and undistorted.
* sustainable development based on balanced economic growth and price stability, a highly competitive social market economy.
* social justice and protection, equality between women and men, solidarity between generations and protection of the rights of the child.
* economic, social and territorial cohesion, and solidarity among member states.
* respect for linguistic and cultural diversity.

In its relations with the wider world the Union&#x27;s objectives are:
* to uphold and promote its values and interests.
* to contribute to peace, security, the sustainable development of the Earth.
* solidarity and mutual respect among people.
* free and fair trade.
* eradication of poverty and the protection of human rights, in particular the rights of the child.
* strict observance and development of international law, including respect for the principles of the United Nations Charter.

===Scope of the Union===

====Competences====
The EU has six &quot;exclusive competences&quot;, policy areas in which member states have agreed that they should act exclusively through the EU and not legislate at a national level. The list remains unchanged from the previous treaties:
* customs union;
* those competition rules that govern the internal market;
* eurozone monetary policy;
* conservation of marine biological resources (the Common Fisheries Policy);
* common commercial policy;
* the conclusion of certain limited international agreements.

There are a number of &quot;shared competences&quot;. These are areas in which member states agree to act individually only where they have not already acted through the EU, or where the EU has ceased to act (though these are areas where member states may act both nationally and through the EU if they wish). Three new competences have been added to those in previous treaties.

There are a number of areas where the EU may take only &quot;supporting, coordinating or complementary action&quot;. In these areas, member states do not confer any competences on the Union, but they agree to act through the Union in order to support their work at national level. Again, three new competences have been added to those from previous treaties.

====Flexibility clause====
The TCE&#x27;s flexibility clause allows the EU to act in areas not made explicit in the TCE, but only:
* if all member states agree;
* with the consent of the European Parliament; and
* where this is necessary to achieve an agreed objective under the TCE.

This clause has been present in EU law since the original Treaty of Rome, which established the EEC in 1958.

====Common foreign and security policy====
The EU is charged with defining and implementing a common foreign and security policy in due time. The wording of this article is taken from the existing Treaty on European Union.

==New provisions==

===Legal personality===
The TCE was going to state explicitly that the EU had a legal personality. Prior to this, the treaties explicitly stated that the European Community, the European Coal and Steel Community and Euratom each had their own separate legal personality, but remained silent over whether the European Union itself had one. They did mandate the EU &quot;to assert its identity on the international scene&quot;, and permitted the European Union to enter into treaties. Brsakoska-Bazerkoska, and Choutheete and Ndoura argue that the EU had an implicit legal personality prior to the Treaty of Lisbon; the latter treaty also contained an express statement that the EU had a legal personality.

===New competences===
The TCE would have conferred upon the EU as new &#x27;shared competences&#x27; the areas of territorial cohesion, energy, and space. These are areas where the EU may act alongside its individual member states. The EU has conferred upon it as new areas of &#x27;supporting, coordinating or complementary action&#x27; the areas of tourism, sport, and administrative co-operation.

===Criminal justice proceedings===
Member states would have continued to co-operate in some areas of criminal judicial proceedings where they agree to do so, as at present. Under the TCE, seven new areas of co-operation would have been added:

* Child abuse
* Drug trafficking
* Fraud
* Human trafficking
* Political corruption
* Terrorism
* Trafficking of arms

===Solidarity clause===
The new solidarity clause of the TCE specifies that any member state which falls victim to a terrorist attack or other disaster will receive assistance from other member states, if it requests it. The type of assistance to be offered is not specified. Instead, the arrangements are to be decided by the Council of Ministers should the situation arise.

===European Public Prosecutor===
Provision exists for the creation of a European Public Prosecutor&#x27;s Office, if all member states agree to it and if the European Parliament gives its consent.

===Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union===

The TCE includes a copy of the Charter already agreed to by all EU member states. This is included in the Constitution so that EU institutions themselves are obliged to conform to the same standards of fundamental rights. At the time of the Charter&#x27;s original agreement, the British Government said that it did not have binding effect. Incorporation into TCE would have put its importance beyond doubt.

===Simplification===

====Simplified jargon and legal instruments====
The TCE made an effort to simplify jargon and reduce the number of EU legal instruments. However, it is a long document couched in technical terms, which proved unpopular when presented (for example) to French voters in their referendum on the TCE.

The TCE unifies legal instruments across areas of policy (referred to as pillars of the European Union in previous treaties). Specifically:
* &#x27;Regulations&#x27; (of the Community pillar) and &#x27;Decisions&#x27; (of the Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters (PJC) pillar) both become referred to as European laws.
* &#x27;Directives&#x27; (of the Community pillar) and &#x27;Framework Decisions&#x27; (of the PJC pillar) both become referred to as European framework laws.
* &#x27;Conventions&#x27; (of the PJC pillar) are done away with, replaced in every case by either European laws or European framework laws.
* &#x27;Joint actions&#x27; and &#x27;Common positions&#x27; (of what is now the Common Foreign and Security Policy Pillar) are both replaced by Decisions.

====Position of Union Minister for Foreign Affairs====
Under the TCE, the role of High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy would be amalgamated with the role of the Commissioner for External Relations. This would create a new Union Minister for Foreign Affairs who would also be a Vice President of the Commission. This individual would be responsible for co-ordinating foreign policy across the Union, representing the EU abroad in areas where member states agree to speak with one voice.

===Functioning of the institutions===

====Qualified majority voting====
More day-to-day decisions in the Council of Ministers would be to be taken by qualified majority voting, requiring a 55% majority of members of the Council representing a 65% majority of citizens. (The 55% is raised to 72% when the Council acts on its own initiative rather than on a legislative proposal from the Commission or the Union Minister for Foreign Affairs.) The unanimous agreement of all member states would only be required for decisions on more sensitive issues, such as tax, social security, foreign policy and defence.

====President of the European Council====
The six-month rotating Presidency of the European Council would switch to a chair chosen by the heads of government, in office for years and renewable once. The role itself would remain administrative and non-executive, but rather than the Presidency being held by a member state as at present, it would be held by an individual elected by and accountable to the Council.

====President of the Council of Ministers====
The six-month rotating Presidency of the Council of Ministers, which currently coincides with the Presidency of the European Council, would be changed to an 18-month rotating Presidency shared by a trio of member countries, in an attempt to provide more continuity. The exception would be the Council&#x27;s Foreign Affairs configuration, which would be chaired by the newly created Union Minister for Foreign Affairs.

====Smaller Commission====
The Commission would be reduced in size from 27 to 18 by the year 2014. There would be fewer Commissioners, with member states taking it in turn to nominate Commissioners two times out of three.

===Parliamentary power and transparency===
* President of the Commission: The candidate for President of the European Commission would be proposed by the European Council, after consultation with the European Parliament, and would be elected by the European Parliament. Parliament would have the final say.
* Parliament as co-legislature: The European Parliament would acquire equal legislative power under the codecision procedure with the Council in virtually all areas of policy. Previously, it had this power in most cases but not all.
* Meeting in public: The Council of Ministers would be required to meet in public when debating all new laws. Currently, it meets in public only for texts covered under the codecision procedure.
* Budget: The final say over the EU&#x27;s annual budget would be given to the European Parliament. Agricultural spending would no longer be ring-fenced, and would be brought under the Parliament&#x27;s control.
* Role of national parliaments: Member states&#x27; national parliaments would be given a new role in scrutinising proposed EU laws, and would be entitled to object if they feel a proposal oversteps the boundary of the Union&#x27;s agreed areas of responsibility. If the Commission wishes to ignore such an objection, it would be forced to submit an explanation to the parliament concerned and to the Council of Ministers.
* Popular initiative: The Commission would be invited to consider any proposal &quot;on matters where citizens consider that a legal act of the Union is required for the purpose of implementing the Constitution&quot; which has the support of one million citizens. The mechanism by which this would be put into practice has yet to be agreed. (See for details.)

===Further integration, amendment and withdrawal===

====Enhanced co-operation====
There would have been a tightening of existing rules for &#x27;enhanced cooperation&#x27;, where some member states would have chosen to act together more closely and others not. A minimum of one third of member states would now be forced to participate in any enhanced cooperation, and the agreement of the European Parliament is needed. The option for enhanced cooperation would also be widened to all areas of agreed EU policy.

====Treaty revisions====
Traditionally amendments to the EU treaties were considered in inter-governmental conferences in which the European Council would meet in long private sessions in order to reach unanimous agreement on the proposed changes. The Convention which wrote the draft constitutional treaty was quite different in this regard. It met in public and was composed of a mix of national and European politicians. The Constitution proposed that amendments to the Constitution would be drafted by a convention unless both the Council of Minister and the European Parliament agreed otherwise.

A simplified revision was created for changes which might be proposed to be made to Title III of Part III of the TCE on the internal policies and action of the Union. Changes to this Title could be made by a decision of the European Council subject to it being ratified by all member states.

The Constitution also proposed a general &#x27;passerelle clause&#x27; () with which the European Council could agree to:
* move from unanimity voting to qualified majority voting, or
* move from a special legislative procedure to the ordinary legislative procedure
in a specific policy area.

Although the Lisbon Treaty was itself drafted behind closed doors, it adopted the amendment procedures proposed by the Constitution.

====Withdrawal clause====
A new clause in the TCE provided for the unilateral withdrawal of any member state from the Union (clause I-60). Under this clause, when a country notifies the Council of its intent to withdraw, a settlement is agreed in the Council with the consent of Parliament. If negotiations are not agreed within two years, the country leaves anyway. An identical provision was subsequently inserted into the treaties by the Lisbon Treaty.

<doc id="234503" wikidata="Q1699623" url="?curid=234503" title="John Cleves Symmes">
<text>John Cleves Symmes (July 21, 1742February 26, 1814) was a delegate to the Continental Congress from New Jersey, and later a pioneer in the Northwest Territory. He was also the father-in-law of President William Henry Harrison and, thereby, the great-grandfather of President Benjamin Harrison.

==Early life==
He was the son of the Rev. Timothy Symmes (1715–1756) and Mary Cleves (died ) of Suffolk County on Long Island. John was born in Riverhead in what was then the Province of New York, a part of British America, on July 21, 1742.

Symmes was educated as a lawyer.

==Career==
Symmes supported the revolution, becoming chairman of the Sussex County, New Jersey Committee of Safety in 1774. When the Revolutionary war began in earnest, he served as Colonel of the 3rd Regiment of the Sussex County militia from 1777 to 1780. The unit was called into service with the Continental Army on several actions.

In 1776, he was elected to the New Jersey Legislative Council (now the New Jersey Senate); he was also a member in 1780. Symmes served on the New Jersey Supreme Court in 1777 and 1778. He was a frequent visitor to Governor William Livingston both in Elizabethtown and in Parsippany.

Symmes represented New Jersey in the Continental Congress (1785–1786), then, in 1788, moved to the west, settling in what later became North Bend, Ohio. He served as a judge of the Territorial Court from 1788 until Ohio became a state in 1803. He also pursued an active career as a land developer and seller.

===Land development===
Symmes bought from the Congress in 1788. President George Washington signed the patent on October 30, 1794, conveying to Symmes 248,250 acres (1,005 km²) plus a surveying township of 23,040 acres (93 km²), in trust, for an academy. This land was known as the Symmes Purchase, and was the cause of considerable controversy in his lifetime and after. The purchase price was $225,000, and was paid in notes issued by the Congress to raise money during the Revolutionary War. There is no doubt that a considerable part of this amount came from Symmes in the first place as he lent most of his own money to the revolution.

There were other investors who served as partners in the transaction, notably General Dayton and Elias Boudinot. There is also no doubt that some of these notes were purchased from other holders, probably at a discount. This was before the rampant speculation in these notes that happened a few years later, but is still questionable.

There were also disputes about the actual boundaries of the purchase and the quality of surveying and validity of titles. In the last years of his life, he spent a great deal of time in court, defending himself from claims, and died in poverty.

==Personal life==
Symmes was married to Anna Tuthill (1741–1776) at Mattituck, New York, on October 30, 1760. They had three children at Mattituck, before moving to Morristown sometime around 1770, and another child born at her father&#x27;s estate Solitude, just outside Morristown (present day Wheatsheaf Farms subdivision off Sussex Avenue in Morris Township). Their children included:

* Maria Symmes (23 April, 1765 – 1802), who married Kentucky State Senator Peyton Short (1761–1825). 
* Mary Symmes (born August 30, 1767)
* Anna Tuthill Symmes (July 25, 1775 – February 25, 1864), who married William Henry Harrison, who eventually became the President of the United States.

His wife died in 1776 and in 1794, John married Governor Livingston&#x27;s daughter, Susannah Livingston (1748–1840). Besides being the governor&#x27;s daughter, she was John Jay&#x27;s sister-in-law.

Symmes died on February 26, 1814, at Cincinnati, Ohio, and is buried at Congress Green Cemetery in North Bend, Ohio.

=== Legacy ===

John Cleves Symmes is the namesake of the village of Cleves, Ohio. and Symmes Township, in Hamilton County, Ohio. Symmes&#x27; nephew and namesake John Cleves Symmes Jr. fought in the War of 1812 and is best known for his Hollow Earth Theory.

Miami University&#x27;s Symmes Hall was named in his honor in 1949. Symmes Hall is located on East Quad near Erickson Dining Hall on the university&#x27;s Oxford, Ohio, campus and is currently being used a residence hall for first-year undergraduate students.

<text>The king of Babylon (Akkadian: , later also ) was the ruler of the ancient Mesopotamian city of Babylon and its kingdom, Babylonia, which existed as an independent realm from the 19th century BC to its fall in the 6th century BC. For the majority of its existence as an independent kingdom, Babylon ruled most of southern Mesopotamia, composed of the ancient regions of Sumer and Akkad. The city experienced two major periods of ascendancy, when Babylonian kings rose to dominate large parts of the Ancient Near East: the First Babylonian Empire (or Old Babylonian Empire, 1894/1880–1595 BC) and the Second Babylonian Empire (or Neo-Babylonian Empire, 626–539 BC). Babylon was ruled by Hammurabi, who created the Code of Hammurabi.

Many of Babylon&#x27;s kings were of foreign origin. Throughout the city&#x27;s nearly two-thousand year history, it was ruled by kings of native Babylonian (Akkadian), Amorite, Kassite, Elamite, Aramean, Assyrian, Chaldean, Persian, Greek and Parthian origin. A king&#x27;s cultural and ethnic background does not appear to have been important for the Babylonian perception of kingship, the important matter instead being whether the king was capable of executing the duties traditionally ascribed to the Babylonian king: establishing peace and security, upholding justice, honouring civil rights, refraining from unlawful taxation, respecting religious traditions, constructing temples, providing gifts to the gods in the temples and maintaining cultic order. Babylonian revolts of independence during the times the city was ruled by foreign empires probably had little to do with the rulers of these empires not being Babylonians and more to do with the rulers rarely visiting Babylon and failing to partake in the city&#x27;s rituals and traditions.

Babylon&#x27;s last native king was Nabonidus, who reigned from 556 to 539 BC. Nabonidus&#x27;s rule was ended through Babylon being conquered by Cyrus the Great of the Achaemenid Empire. Though early Achaemenid kings continued to place importance on Babylon and continued using the title &#x27;king of Babylon&#x27;, later Achaemenid rulers being ascribed the title is probably only something done by the Babylonians themselves, with the kings themselves having abandoned it. Babylonian scribes continued to recognise rulers of the empires that controlled Babylonia as their kings until the time of the Parthian Empire, when Babylon was gradually abandoned. Though Babylon never regained independence after the Achaemenid conquest, there were several attempts by the Babylonians to drive out their foreign rulers and re-establish their kingdom, possibly as late as 336/335 BC under the rebel Nidin-Bel.

== Introduction ==
=== Royal titles ===

Throughout the city&#x27;s long history, various titles were used to designate the ruler of Babylon and its kingdom, the most common titles being &#x27;viceroy of Babylon&#x27;, &#x27;king of Karduniash&#x27; and &#x27;king of Sumer and Akkad&#x27;. Use of one of the titles did not mean that the others could not be used simultaneously. For instance, the Neo-Assyrian king Tiglath-Pileser III (729–727 BC in Babylon), used all three of the aforementioned titles.

* Viceroy (or governor) of Babylon () – emphasises the political dominion of Babylon itself. For much of the city&#x27;s history, its rulers referred to themselves as viceroys or governors, rather than kings. The reason for this was that Babylon&#x27;s true king was formally considered to be its national deity, Marduk. By not explicitly claiming the royal title, Babylonian rulers thus showed reverence to the city&#x27;s god. The reign of the Neo-Assyrian king Sennacherib (705–681 BC) has been noted as a particular break in this tradition, as he assumed the title king of Babylon (), which may have contributed to widespread negative reception of him in Babylonia. However, is recorded as being used in some inscriptions from before Sennacherib&#x27;s time, such as in the inscriptions of his father and predecessor Sargon II (710–705 BC in Babylon), who used it interchangeably with . Though Sennacherib&#x27;s successors would primarily use , there are likewise examples of them instead using . These titles would also be used interchangeably by the later Neo-Babylonian kings.
* King of Karduniash () – refers to rule of southern Mesopotamia as a whole. &#x27;Karduniash&#x27; was the Kassite name for the Babylonian kingdom, and the title &#x27;king of Karduniash&#x27; was introduced by the city&#x27;s third dynasty (the Kassites). The title continued to be used long after the Kassites had lost control of Babylon, for instance as late as under the native king Nabu-shuma-ukin I ( 900–888 BC) and the Neo-Assyrian king Esarhaddon (681–669 BC).
* King of Sumer and Akkad () – refers to rule of southern Mesopotamia as a whole. A title originally used by the kings of the Third Dynasty of Ur ( 2112–2004 BC), centuries prior to Babylon&#x27;s foundation. The title was used by kings to connect themselves to the culture and legacy of the Sumerian and Akkadian civilizations, as well as to lay claim to the political hegemony achieved during the ancient Akkadian Empire. The title was also a geographical one, in that southern Mesopotamia was typically divided into the two regions Sumer (the south) and Akkad (the north), meaning that &#x27;king of Sumer and Akkad&#x27; referred to rulership over the entire country. The title was used by the Babylonian kings until the end of the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 539 BC, and was also assumed by Cyrus the Great, who conquered Babylon and ruled Babylonia until his death in 530 BC.

=== Role and legitimacy ===
The Babylonian kings derived their right to rule from divine appointment by Babylon&#x27;s patron deity Marduk and through consecration by the city&#x27;s priests. Marduk&#x27;s main cult image (often conflated with the god himself), the statue of Marduk, was prominently used in the coronation rituals for the kings, who received their crowns &quot;out of the hands&quot; of Marduk during the New Year&#x27;s festival, symbolizing them being bestowed with kingship by the deity. The king&#x27;s rule and his role as Marduk&#x27;s vassal on Earth were reaffirmed annually at this time of year, when the king entered the Esagila, Babylon&#x27;s main cult temple, alone on the fifth day of the New Year&#x27;s Festival each year and met with the high priest. The high priest removed the regalia from the king, slapped him across the face and made him kneel before Marduk&#x27;s statue. The king would then tell the statue that he had not oppressed his people and that he had maintained order throughout the year, whereafter the high priest would reply (on behalf of Marduk) that the king could continue to enjoy divine support for his rule, returning the royal regalia. Through being a patron of Babylon&#x27;s temples, the king extended his generosity towards the Mesopotamian gods, who in turn empowered his rule and lent him their authority.

Babylonian kings were expected to establish peace and security, uphold justice, honor civil rights, refrain from unlawful taxation, respect religious traditions and maintain cultic order. None of the king&#x27;s responsibilities and duties required him to be ethnically or even culturally Babylonian. Any foreigner sufficiently familiar with the royal customs of Babylonia could adopt the title, though they might then require the assistance of the native priesthood and the native scribes. Ethnicity and culture does not appear to have been important in the Babylonian perception of kingship: many foreign kings enjoyed support from the Babylonians and several native kings were despised. That the rule of some foreign kings was not supported by the Babylonians probably has little to do with their ethnic or cultural background, but rather that they were perceived as not properly executing the traditional duties of the Babylonian king.

=== Dynasties ===

As with other monarchies, the kings of Babylon are grouped into a series of royal dynasties, a practice started by the ancient Babylonians themselves in their king lists. The generally accepted Babylonian dynasties should not be understood as familial groupings in the same vein as the term is commonly used by historians for ruling families in later kingdoms and empires. Though Babylon&#x27;s first dynasty did form a dynastic grouping where all monarchs were related, the dynasties of the first millennium BC, notably the Dynasty of E, did not constitute a series of coherent familial relationships at all. In a Babylonian sense, the term dynasty, rendered as or , related to a sequence of monarchs from the same ethnic or tribal group (i.e. the Kassite dynasty), the same region (i.e. the dynasties of the Sealand) or the same city (i.e. the dynasties of Babylon and Isin). In some cases, kings known to be genealogically related, such as Eriba-Marduk ( 769–760 BC) and his grandson Marduk-apla-iddina II (722–710 BC and 703 BC), were separated into different dynasties, the former designated as belonging to the Dynasty of E and the latter as belonging to the (Third) Sealand dynasty.

=== Sources ===
Among all the different types of documents uncovered through excavations in Mesopotamia, the most important for reconstructions of chronology and political history are king-lists and chronicles, grouped together under the term &#x27;chronographic texts&#x27;. Mesopotamian king lists are of special importance when reconstructing the sequences of monarchs, as they are collections of royal names and regnal dates, also often with additional information such as the relations between the kings, arranged in a table format. In terms of Babylonian rulers, the main document is the Babylonian King List (BKL), a group of three independent documents: Babylonian King List A, B, and C. In addition to the main Babylonian King Lists, there are also additional king-lists that record rulers of Babylon.
* Babylonian King List A (BKLa, BM 33332) — created at some point after the foundation of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, Babylonian King List A records the kings of Babylon from the beginning of Babylon&#x27;s first dynasty under Sumu-abum ( 1894–1881 BC) to Kandalanu (648–627 BC). The end of the tablet is broken off, suggesting that it originally listed rulers after Kandalanu as well, possibly also listing the kings of the Neo-Babylonian Empire. All dynasties are separated by horizontal lines, under which subscript records a sum of the regnal years of each dynasty, and the number of kings the dynasties produced. Written in Neo-Babylonian script.
*Babylonian King List B (BKLb, BM 38122) — date of origin uncertain, written in Neo-Babylonian script. Babylonian King List B records the kings of Babylon&#x27;s first dynasty, and the kings of the First Sealand dynasty, with subscripts recording the number of kings and their summed up reigns in these dynasties. Regnal years are recorded for the kings of the first dynasty, but omitted for the kings of the Sealand dynasty. The regnal years used for the kings are inconsistent with their actual reign lengths, possibly due to the author having copied the list from a document where the years had been lost or damaged. The list records genealogical information for all but two of the kings of the first dynasty, but only for two of the kings of the Sealand dynasty. Because the document is essentially two lists for two dynasties, it is possible that it was copied and extracted from longer king lists in the late period for some unknown purpose.
*Babylonian King List C (BKLc) — a short text, written in Neo-Babylonian script. King List C is important as a source on the second dynasty of Isin, as the first seven lines of the preserved nine lines of text provide a portion of the sequence of kings of this dynasty and their dates. The corresponding section in Babylonian King List A is incompletely preserved. As the list ends with the Isin dynasty&#x27;s seventh king, Marduk-shapik-zeri ( 1081–1069 BC), it is possible that it was written during the reign of his successor, Adad-apla-iddina ( 1068–1047 BC). Its short length and unusual shape (being curved rather than flat) means that it might have been a practice tablet used by a young Babylonian student.
*Synchronistic King List (ScKL) — a collection of individual tablets and examplars. The Synchronistic King List features two columns, and records the kings of Babylon and Assyria together, with kings recorded next to each other presumably being contemporaries. Unlike most of the other documents, this list generally omits regnal years and any genealogical information, but it also differs in including many of the chief scribes under the Assyrian and Babylonian kings. The tablet with the earliest known portion of the list begins with the Assyrian king Erishum I (&quot;uncertain regnal dates&quot;) and the Babylonian king Sumu-la-El ( 1880–1845 BC). The latest known portion ends with Ashur-etil-ilani (631–627 BC) in Assyria and Kandalanu in Babylon. As it is written in Neo-Assyrian script, it might have been created near the end of the Neo-Assyrian Empire.
*Uruk King List (UKL, IM 65066) — the preserved portion of this king list records rulers from Kandalanu in the Assyrian period to Seleucus II Callinicus (246–225 BC) in the Seleucid period.
*Babylonian King List of the Hellenistic Period (BM 35603) — written at Babylon at some point after 141 BC, recording rulers from the start of Hellenistic rule in Babylonia under Alexander the Great (331–323 in Babylon), to the end of Seleucid rule under Demetrius II Nicator (145–141 BC in Babylon) and the conquest of Babylonia by the Parthian Empire. Entries before Seleucus I Nicator (305–281 BC) and after Antiochus IV Epiphanes (175–164 BC) are damaged and fragmentary.
As years in Babylon were named after the current king, and the current year of their reign, date formulas in economic, astronomical and literary cuneiform texts written in Babylonia also provide highly important and useful chronological data.

=== Kingship after the Neo-Babylonian Empire ===

In addition to the king lists described above, cuneiform inscriptions and tablets confidently establish that the Babylonians continued to recognise the foreign rulers of Babylonia as their legitimate monarchs after the fall of the Neo-Babylonian Empire and throughout the rule of the Achaemenid (539–331 BC), Argead (331–310 BC), and Seleucid (305–141 BC) empires, as well as well into the rule of the Parthian Empire (141 BC – AD 224).

Early Achaemenid kings greatly respected Babylonian culture and history, and regarded Babylonia as a separate entity or kingdom united with their own kingdom in something akin to a personal union. Despite this, the Babylonians would grow to resent Achaemenid rule, just as they had resented Assyrian rule during the time their country was under the rule of the Neo-Assyrian Empire (722–626 BC). Babylonian resentment of the Achaemenids likely had little to do with the Achaemenids being foreigners, but rather that the Achaemenid kings were perceived to not be capable of executing the duties of the Babylonian king properly, in line with established Babylonian tradition. This perception then led to frequent Babylonian revolts, an issue experienced by both the Assyrians and the Achaemenids. Since the capitals of the Assyrian and Achaemenid empires were elsewhere, these foreign kings did not regularly partake in the city&#x27;s rituals (meaning that they could not be celebrated in the same way that they traditionally were) and they rarely performed their traditional duties to the Babylonian cults through constructing temples and presenting cultic gifts to the city&#x27;s gods. This failure might have been interpreted as the kings thus not having the necessary divine endorsement to be considered true kings of Babylon.

The standard regnal title used by the early Achaemenid kings, not only in Babylon but throughout their empire, was &#x27;king of Babylon and king of the lands&#x27;. The Babylonian title was gradually abandoned by the Achaemenid king Xerxes I (486–465 BC), after he had to put down a major Babylonian uprising. Xerxes also divided the previously large Babylonian satrapy into smaller sub-units and, according to some sources, damaged the city itself in an act of retribution. The last Achaemenid king whose own royal inscriptions officially used the title &#x27;king of Babylon&#x27; was Xerxes I&#x27;s son and successor Artaxerxes I (465–424 BC). After Artaxerxes I&#x27;s rule there are few examples of monarchs themselves using the title, though the Babylonians continued to ascribe it to their rulers. The only known official explicit use of &#x27;king of Babylon&#x27; by a king during the Seleucid period can be found in the Antiochus cylinder, a clay cylinder containing a text wherein Antiochus I Soter (281–261 BC) calls himself, and his father Seleucus I Nicator (305–281 BC), by the title &#x27;king of Babylon&#x27;, alongside various other ancient Mesopotamian titles and honorifics. The Seleucid kings continued to respect Babylonian traditions and culture, with several Seleucid kings recorded as having &quot;given gifts to Marduk&quot; in Babylon and the New Year&#x27;s Festival still being recorded as a contemporary event. One of the last times the festival is known to have been celebrated was in 188 BC, under the Seleucid king Antiochus III (222–187 BC), who prominently partook in the rituals. From the Hellenistic period (i. e. the rule of the Greek Argeads and Seleucids) onwards, Greek culture became established in Babylonia, but per Oelsner (2014), the Hellenistic culture &quot;did not deeply penetrate the ancient Babylonian culture, that persisted to exist in certain domains and areas until the 2nd c. AD&quot;.

Under the Parthian Empire, Babylon was gradually abandoned as a major urban centre and the old Babylonian culture diminished. The nearby and newer imperial capitals cities of Seleucia and later Ctesiphon overshadowed the ancient city and became the seats of power in the region. Babylon was still important in the first century or so of Parthian rule, and cuneiform tablets continued to recognise the rule of the Parthian kings. The standard title formula applied to the Parthian kings in Babylonian documents was &quot; &quot; (, &quot;Arsaces, king of kings&quot;). Several tablets from the Parthian period also in their date formulae mention the queen of the incumbent Parthian king, alongside the king, the first time women were officially recognised as monarchs of Babylon. The few documents that survive from Babylon in the Parthian period indicate a growing sense of alarm and alienation in Babylon as the Parthian kings were mostly absent from the city and the Babylonians noticed their culture slowly slipping away.

When exactly Babylon was abandoned is unclear. The Roman author Pliny the Elder wrote in AD 50 that proximity to Seleucia had turned Babylon into a &quot;barren waste&quot; and during their campaigns in the east, Roman emperors Trajan (in AD 115) and Septimius Severus (in AD 199) supposedly found the city destroyed and deserted. Archaeological evidence and the writings of Abba Arikha ( AD 219) indicate that at least the temples of Babylon may still have been active in the early 3rd century. If any remnants of the old Babylonian culture still existed at that point, they would have been decisively wiped out as the result of religious reforms in the early Sasanian Empire AD 230.

Due to a shortage of sources, and the timing of Babylon&#x27;s abandonment being unknown, the last ruler recognised by the Babylonians as king is not known. The latest known cuneiform tablet is W22340a, found at Uruk and dated to AD 79/80. The tablet preserves the word (king), indicating that the Babylonians by this point still recognised a king. At this time, Babylonia was ruled by the Parthian rival king (i. e. usurper) Artabanus III. Modern historians are divided on where the line of monarchs ends. Spar and Lambert (2005) did not include any rulers beyond the first century AD in their list of kings recognised by the Babylonians, but Beaulieu (2018) considered &#x27;Dynasty XIV of Babylon&#x27; (his designation for the Parthians as rulers of the city) to have lasted until the end of Parthian rule of Babylonia in the early 3rd century AD.

=== Names in cuneiform ===
The list below includes the names of all the kings in Akkadian, as well as how the Akkadian names were rendered in cuneiform signs. Up until the reign of Burnaburiash II ( 1359–1333 BC) of the Kassite dynasty (Dynasty III), Sumerian was the dominant language for use in inscriptions and official documents, with Akkadian eclipsing it under the reign of Kurigalzu II ( 1332–1308 BC), and thereafter replacing Sumerian in inscriptions and documents. For consistency purposes, and because several kings and their names are known only from king lists, which were written in Akkadian centuries after Burnaburiash II&#x27;s reign, this list solely uses Akkadian, rather than Sumerian, for the royal names, though this is anachronistic for rulers before Burnaburiash II.

It is not uncommon for there to be several different spellings of the same name in Akkadian, even when referring to the same individual. To examplify this, the table below presents two ways the name of Nebuchadnezzar II (605–562 BC) was spelt in Akkadian (). The list of kings below uses more concise spellings when possible, primarily based on the renditions of names in date formulae and king lists.

Even if the same spelling is used, there were also several different scripts of cuneiform signs: a name, even if spelt the same, looks considerably different in Old Babylonian signs compared to Neo-Babylonian signs or Neo-Assyrian signs. The table below presents different variants, depending on the signs used, of the name Antiochus in Akkadian (). The list of kings below uses Neo-Babylonian and Neo-Assyrian signs, given that those scripts are the signs primarily used in the king lists.
== Dynasty I (Amorite), 1894–1595 BC ==

Per BKLb, the native name for this dynasty was simply (&#x27;dynasty of Babylon&#x27;). To differentiate it from the other dynasties that later ruled Babylon, modern historians often refer to this dynasty as the &#x27;First Dynasty of Babylon&#x27;. Some historians refer to this dynasty as the &#x27;Amorite dynasty&#x27; on account of the kings being of Amorite descent. While the king list gives a regnal length of 31 years for the final king, Samsu-Ditana, the destruction layer at Babylon is dated to his 26th year and no later sources have been found.

== Dynasty II (First Sealand), 1725–1475 BC ==
Both BKLa and BKLb refer to this dynasty as (&#x27;dynasty of Urukug&#x27;). Presumably, the city of Urukug was the dynasty&#x27;s point of origin. Some literary sources refer to some of the kings of this dynasty as &#x27;kings of the Sealand&#x27;, and thus modern historians refer to it as a dynasty of the Sealand. The designation as the first Sealand dynasty differentiates it from Dynasty V, which the Babylonians actually referred to as a &#x27;dynasty of the Sealand&#x27;. This dynasty overlaps with Dynasty I and Dynasty III, with these kings actually ruling the region south of Babylon (the Sealand) rather than Babylon itself. For instance, the king Gulkishar of this dynasty was actually a contemporary of Dynasty I&#x27;s last king, Samsu-Ditana. It is possible that the dynasty was included in Babylon&#x27;s dynastic history by later scribes either because it controlled Babylon for a time, because it controlled or strongly influenced parts of Babylonia or because it was the most stable power of its time in Babylonia. The dates listed below are highly uncertain, and follow the timespan listed for the dynasty in Beaulieu (2018), 1725–1475 BC, with the individual dates based the lengths of the reigns of the kings, also as given by Beaulieu (2018).

== Dynasty III (Kassite), 1729–1155 BC ==
The entry for this dynasty&#x27;s name in BKLa is lost, but other Babylonian sources refer to it as (&#x27;dynasty of the Kassites&#x27;). The reconstruction of the sequence and names of the early rulers of this dynasty, the kings before Karaindash, is difficult and controversial. The king lists are damaged at this point and the preserved portions seem to contradict each other: for instance, BKLa has a king in-between Kashtiliash I and Abi-Rattash, omitted in the Synchronistic King List, whereas the Synchronistic King List includes Kashtiliash II, omitted in BKLa, between Abi-Rattash and Urzigurumash. It also seems probable that the earliest kings ascribed to this dynasty in king lists did not actually rule Babylon, but were added as they were ancestors of the later rulers. Babylonia was not fully consolidated and reunified until the reign of Ulamburiash, who defeated Ea-gamil, the last king of the first Sealand dynasty.

== Dynasty IV (Second Isin), 1153–1022 BC ==

Per BKLa, the native name of this dynasty was (&#x27;dynasty of Isin&#x27;). Presumably, the city of Isin was the dynasty&#x27;s point of origin. Modern historians refer to this dynasty as the second dynasty of Isin to differentiate it from the ancient Sumerian dynasty of Isin. Previous scholarship assumed that the first king of this dynasty, Marduk-kabit-ahheshu, ruled for the first years of his reign concurrently with the last Kassite king, but recent research suggests that this was not the case. This list follows the revised chronology of the kings of this dynasty, per Beaulieu (2018), which also means revising the dates of subsequent dynasties.

== Dynasty V (Second Sealand dynasty), 1021–1001 BC ==

Per BKLa, the native name of this dynasty was (&#x27;dynasty of the Sealand&#x27;). Modern historians call it the second Sealand dynasty in order to distinguish it from Dynasty II.

== Dynasty VI (Bazi), 1000–981 BC ==

BKLa refers to this dynasty as (&#x27;dynasty of Baz&#x27;) and the Dynastic Chronicle calls it (&#x27;dynasty of Bit-Bazi&#x27;). The Bit-Bazi were a clan attested already in the Kassite period. It is likely that the dynasty derives its name either from the city of Baz, or from descent from Bazi, the legendary founder of that city.

== Dynasty VII (Elamite), 980–975 BC ==
BKLa dynastically separates Mar-biti-apla-usur from other kings with horizontal lines, marking him as belonging to a dynasty of his own. The Dynastic Chronicle also groups him by himself, and refers to his dynasty (containing only him) as the (&#x27;dynasty of Elam&#x27;).

== Dynasty VIII (E), 974–732 BC ==

Per BKLa, the native name of this dynasty was (&#x27;dynasty of E&#x27;). The meaning of &#x27;E&#x27; is not clear, but it is likely a reference to the city of Babylon, meaning that the name should be interpreted as &#x27;dynasty of Babylon&#x27;. The time of the dynasty of E was a time of great instability and the unrelated kings grouped together under this dynasty even belonged to completely different ethnic groups. Another Babylonian historical work, the Dynastic Chronicle (though it is preserved only fragmentarily), breaks this dynasty up into a succession of brief, smaller, dynasties.
:: &quot;&quot;

== Dynasty IX (Assyrian), 732–626 BC ==

&#x27;Dynasty IX&#x27; is used to, broadly speaking, refer to the rulers of Babylonia during the time it was ruled by the Neo-Assyrian Empire, including Assyrian kings of both the Adaside dynasty and the subsequent Sargonid dynasty, as well as various non-dynastic vassal and rebel kings. They are often grouped together as a dynasty by modern scholars as BKLa does not use lines to separate the rulers, used elsewhere in the list to separate dynasties. BKLa also assigns individual dynastic labels to some of the kings, though thus not in the same fashion as is done for the more concrete earlier dynasties. The designation associated with each king (they are recorded in the list up until Mushezib-Marduk) is included in the table below and follows Fales (2014).

== Dynasty X (Chaldean), 626–539 BC ==
The native name for this dynasty does not appear in any sources, as the kings of Dynasty X are only listed in king lists made during the Hellenistic period, when the concept of dynasties ceased being used by Babylonians chronographers to describe Babylonian history. Modern historians typically refer to the dynasty as the &#x27;Neo-Babylonian dynasty&#x27;, as these kings ruled the Neo-Babylonian Empire, or the &#x27;Chaldean dynasty&#x27;, after the presumed ethnic origin of the royal line. The Dynastic Chronicle, a later document, refers to Nabonidus as the founder and only king of the &#x27;dynasty of Harran&#x27; (), and may also indicate a dynastic change with Neriglissar&#x27;s accession, but much of the text is fragmentary.

== Babylon under foreign rule, 539 BC – AD 224 ==
The concept of dynasties ceased being used in king-lists made after the fall of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, meaning that the native Babylonian designations for the ruling dynasties of the foreign empires that succeeded the Chaldean kings are unknown.

=== Dynasty XI (Achaemenid), 539–331 BC ===

<doc id="234507" wikidata="Q1422837" url="?curid=234507" title="The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians">
<text>The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians is an encyclopedic dictionary of music and musicians. Along with the German-language &quot;Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart&quot;, it is one of the largest reference works on the history and theory of music. Earlier editions were published under the titles A Dictionary of Music and Musicians, and Grove&#x27;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians; the work has gone through several editions since the 19th century and is widely used. In recent years it has been made available as an electronic resource called Grove Music Online, which is now an important part of Oxford Music Online.

== &quot;A Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; ==
&quot;A Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; was first published in London by Macmillan and Co. in four volumes (1879, 1880, 1883, 1889) edited by George Grove with an Appendix edited by J. A. Fuller Maitland in the fourth volume. An Index edited by Mrs. E. Wodehouse was issued as a separate volume in 1890. In 1900, minor corrections were made to the plates and the entire series was reissued in four volumes, with the index added to volume 4. The original edition and the reprint are now freely available online. Grove limited the chronological span of his work to begin at 1450 while continuing up to his time.

== &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; ==
The second edition (&quot;Grove II&quot;), in five volumes, was edited by Fuller Maitland and published from 1904 to 1910, this time as &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;. The individual volumes of the second edition were reprinted many times. An &quot;American Supplement&quot; edited by Waldo Selden Pratt and Charles N. Boyd was published in 1920 in Philadelphia by Theodore Presser. This edition removed the first edition&#x27;s beginning date of 1450, though important earlier composers and theorists are still missing from this edition. These volumes are also now freely available online.

The third edition (&quot;Grove III&quot;), also in five volumes, was an extensive revision of the 2nd edition; it was edited by H. C. Colles and published in 1927. The 3rd edition was reprinted several times. An &quot;American Supplement&quot; was published in the U.S. in 1927, and also later reprinted separately.

An extra-large &quot;Supplementary Volume&quot; also edited by Colles was published in 1940 and called the fourth edition (&quot;Grove IV&quot;). A reprint of the 3rd edition with some corrections, was released at the same time. The five-volume 3rd edition, with the &quot;Supplementary Volume&quot; as volume 6, and the &quot;American Supplement&quot; of the 3rd edition as volume 7, were reprinted together as a set in 1945.

The fifth edition (&quot;Grove V&quot;), in nine volumes, was edited by Eric Blom and published in 1954. This was the most thoroughgoing revision of the work since its inception, with many articles rewritten in a more modern style and a large number of entirely new articles. Many of the articles were written by Blom personally, or translated by him. An additional &quot;Supplementary Volume&quot; prepared by Eric Blom and completed by Denis Stevens after Blom&#x27;s death in 1959, was issued in 1961. The fifth edition was reprinted in 1966, 1968, 1970, 1973, and 1975, each time with numerous corrections, updates, and other small changes.

== &quot;The New Grove&quot; ==

=== First edition ===
The next edition was published in 1980 under the name &quot;The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; and was greatly expanded to 20 volumes with 22,500 articles and 16,500 biographies. Its senior editor was Stanley Sadie with Nigel Fortune also serving as one of the main editors for the publication.

It was reprinted with minor corrections each subsequent year until 1995, except 1982 and 1983. In the mid-1990s, the hardback set sold for about $2,300. A paperback edition was reprinted in 1995 which sold for $500.
* – hardback
* – paperback
* – British special edition
* – American special edition

===Spin-offs===
Some sections of &quot;The New Grove&quot; were also issued as small sets and individual books on particular topics. These typically were enhanced with expanded and updated material and included individual and grouped composer biographies, a four-volume dictionary of American music (1984; revised 2013, 8 vols.), a three-volume dictionary of musical instruments (1984), a four-volume dictionary of opera (1992), and a volume on women composers (1994).

=== Second edition ===
The second edition under this title (the seventh overall) was published in 2001, in 29 volumes. It was also made available by subscription on the internet in a service called Grove Music Online. It was again edited by Stanley Sadie, and the executive editor was John Tyrrell. It was originally to be released on CD-ROM as well, but this plan was dropped. As Sadie writes in the preface, &quot;The biggest single expansion in the present edition has been in the coverage of 20th-century composers&quot;.

This edition was subjected to some criticism owing to the significant number of typographical and factual errors that it contained, but also received positive reviews. Two volumes were re-issued in corrected versions after production errors originally caused the omission of sections of Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s worklist and Richard Wagner&#x27;s bibliography.

* – British
* – American (cloth: alk.paper)

Publication of the second edition of &quot;The New Grove&quot; was accompanied by a Web-based version, &quot;Grove Music Online&quot;. It too, attracted some initial criticism, for example for the way in which images were not incorporated into the text but kept separate.

== &quot;Grove Music Online&quot; and &quot;Oxford Music Online&quot; ==
The complete text of &quot;The New Grove&quot; is available to subscribers to the online service &quot;Grove Music Online&quot;.

&quot;Grove Music Online&quot; includes a large number of revisions and additions of new articles. In addition to the 29 volumes of &quot;The New Grove&quot; second edition, &quot;Grove Music Online&quot; incorporates the four-volume &quot;New Grove Dictionary of Opera&quot; (ed. Stanley Sadie, 1992) and the three-volume &quot;New Grove Dictionary of Jazz&quot;, second edition (ed. Barry Kernfeld, 2002), &quot;The Grove Dictionary of American Music&quot; and &quot;The Grove Dictionary of Musical Instruments&quot;, comprising a total of more than 50,000 articles. The current editor-in-chief of Grove Music, the name given to the complete slate of print and online resources that encompass the Grove brand, is University of Pittsburgh professor Deane Root. He assumed the editorship in 2009.

The dictionary, originally published by Macmillan, was sold in 2004 to Oxford University Press. Since 2001 &quot;Grove Music Online&quot; has served as a cornerstone of Oxford University Press&#x27;s larger online research tool &quot;Oxford Music Online&quot;, which remains a subscription-based service. As well as being available to individual and educational subscribers, it is available for use at many public and university libraries worldwide, through institutional subscriptions.

&quot;Grove Music Online&quot; identifies itself as the eighth edition of the overall work.

== Contents ==
The 2001 edition contains:

* 29,499 articles in total
** 5,623 entirely new articles
* 20,374 biographies of composers, performers and writers on music
** 96 articles on theatre directors
* 1,465 articles on styles, terms and genres
** 283 articles on concepts
* 805 articles on regions, countries and cities

** 131 articles on sources

==Hoaxes and parodies==
Two non-existent composers have appeared in the work:

Dag Henrik Esrum-Hellerup was the subject of a hoax entry in the 1980 &quot;New Grove&quot;. Esrum-Hellerup&#x27;s surname derives from a Danish village and a suburb of Copenhagen. The writer of the entry was Robert Layton. Though successfully introduced into the encyclopaedia, Esrum-Hellerup appeared in the first printing only: soon exposed as a hoax, the entry was removed and the space filled with an illustration. In 1983, the Danish organist Henry Palsmar founded an amateur choir, the Esrum-Hellerup Choir, along with several former pupils of the Song School, St. Annae Gymnasium in Copenhagen.

Guglielmo Baldini was the name of a non-existent composer who was the subject of a hoax entry in the 1980 edition. Unlike Esrum-Hellerup, Baldini was not a modern creation: his name and biography were in fact created almost a century earlier by the German musicologist Hugo Riemann. The &quot;New Grove&quot; entry on Baldini was supported by a fictional reference in the form of an article supposedly in the &quot;Archiv für Freiburger Diözesan Geschichte&quot;. Though successfully introduced into the encyclopaedia, Baldini appeared in the first printing only: soon exposed as a hoax, the entry was removed.

Seven parody entries, written by contributors to the 1980 edition, and full of musical puns and dictionary in-jokes, were published in the February 1981 issue of &quot;The Musical Times&quot; (which was also edited by Stanley Sadie at the time). These entries never appeared in the dictionary itself and are:
* Brown, &quot;Mother&quot; (Mary) (&quot;b.&quot; 1550; &quot;d.&quot; Wapping, 3 January 1611)
* Ear-flute
* Hameln [Hamelin]
* Khan&#x27;t, Genghis (Tamburlaine) (&quot;b.&quot; Ulan Bator, c. 1880; &quot;d.&quot; New York, 22 November 1980)
* Stainglit (Nevers), Sait d&#x27;Ail (&quot;fl&quot; Middle Ages) – i.e. &quot;Stanley Sadie&quot;, following the example of Luis van Rooten
* Toblerone
* Verdi, Lasagne [&#x27;Il Bolognese&#x27;] (&quot;b.&quot; Bologna, 10 October 1813; &quot;d.&quot; Naples, 15 March 1867)

<text>Robert Sargent Shriver Jr. (November 9, 1915 – January 18, 2011) was an American diplomat, politician, and activist. He was a member of the Shriver family by birth, and a member of the Kennedy family through his marriage to Eunice Kennedy. Shriver was the driving force behind the creation of the Peace Corps, and founded the Job Corps, Head Start, VISTA, Upward Bound, and other programs as the architect of the 1960s War on Poverty. He was the Democratic Party&#x27;s nominee for vice president in the 1972 presidential election.

Born in Westminster, Maryland, Shriver attended Yale University, then Yale Law School, graduating in 1941. An opponent of U.S. entry into World War II, he helped establish the America First Committee but volunteered for the United States Navy before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. During the war, he served in the South Pacific, participating in the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. After being discharged from the navy, he worked as an assistant editor for &quot;Newsweek&quot; and met Eunice Kennedy, marrying her in 1953.

He worked on the 1960 presidential campaign of his brother-in-law, John F. Kennedy, and helped establish the Peace Corps after Kennedy&#x27;s victory. After Kennedy&#x27;s assassination, Shriver served in the administration of Lyndon B. Johnson and helped establish several anti-poverty programs as director of the Office of Economic Opportunity from October 16, 1964, to March 22, 1968. He also served as the United States Ambassador to France from 1968 to 1970. In 1972, Democratic vice presidential nominee Thomas Eagleton resigned from the ticket, and Shriver was chosen as his replacement. The Democratic ticket of George McGovern and Shriver lost in a landslide election defeat to Republican President Richard Nixon and Vice President Spiro Agnew. Shriver briefly sought the 1976 Democratic presidential nomination but dropped out of the race after the first set of primaries.

After leaving office, he resumed the practice of law, becoming a partner with Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &amp; Jacobson. He also served as president of the Special Olympics and was briefly a part-owner of the Baltimore Orioles. He was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in 2003 and died in Bethesda, Maryland, in 2011.

==Early life and education==
Robert Sargent Shriver Jr. was born in Westminster, Maryland, the younger of two sons. Shriver&#x27;s parents Robert Sargent Shriver Sr. and Hilda, who had also been born with the surname Shriver, were second cousins. His elder brother was Thomas Herbert Shriver. Shriver was a member of the Shriver family that has been in Maryland since 1721 and have occupied the Union Mills Homestead. His grandfather, Thomas Herbert Shriver, guided J. E. B. Stuart to the battle of Gettysburg when Thomas was just seventeen years of age. He was also a descendant of David Shriver, who signed the Maryland Constitution and Bill of Rights at Maryland&#x27;s Constitutional Convention of 1776.

He spent his high school years at Canterbury School in New Milford, Connecticut, which he attended on a full scholarship. In his freshman year at Canterbury, he befriended future brother-in-law President John F. Kennedy. He was on Canterbury&#x27;s baseball, basketball, and football teams, became the editor of the school&#x27;s newspaper, and participated in choral and debating clubs. On June 9, 2023, Shriver was inducted into the Canterbury School Athletic Hall of Fame for all three sports. After graduating from The Browning School in 1934, Shriver spent the summer in Germany as part of The Experiment in International Living, returning in the fall of 1934 to enter Yale University, where he was elected chairman of the &quot;Yale Daily News&quot; and made a brother in the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity, as well as a member of Yale&#x27;s Scroll and Key society.

==Military career==
An early opponent of American involvement in World War II, Shriver was a founding member of the America First Committee, an organization started in 1940 by a group of Yale Law School students, also including future President Gerald Ford and future Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart, which tried to keep the US out of the European war. Nevertheless, Shriver volunteered for the US Navy before the attack on Pearl Harbor and said he had a duty to serve his country even if he disagreed with its policies. He spent five years on active duty, mostly in the South Pacific, serving aboard the , reaching the rank of lieutenant commander (O-4). He was awarded a Purple Heart for wounds he received during the bombardment of Guadalcanal.

==Family life==
Shriver&#x27;s relationship with the Kennedys began when he was working as an assistant editor at &quot;Newsweek&quot; after his discharge from the Navy. He met Eunice Kennedy at a party in New York, and shortly afterwards, family patriarch Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. asked him to look at diary entries written by his eldest son, Joseph P. Kennedy Jr., who had died in a plane crash while he was on a military mission during World War II. Shriver was later hired to manage the Merchandise Mart, part of Kennedy&#x27;s business empire, in Chicago, Illinois.

After a seven-year courtship, Shriver married Eunice Kennedy on May 23, 1953, at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral in New York City. She was the third daughter of Joseph Kennedy Sr. and Rose Kennedy.

They had five children: Robert Sargent &quot;Bobby&quot; Shriver III (born April 28, 1954), Maria Owings Shriver (born November 6, 1955), Timothy Perry Shriver (born August 29, 1959), Mark Kennedy Shriver (born February 17, 1964), and Anthony Paul Kennedy Shriver (born July 20, 1965). The Shrivers were married for 56 years, and often worked together on projects.

Shriver was admitted to practice law in the District of Columbia, Illinois, and New York, and at the US Supreme Court.

A devout Catholic, Shriver attended daily Mass and always carried a rosary of well-worn wooden beads. He was critical of abortion and was a signatory to &quot;A New Compact of Care: Caring about Women, Caring for the Unborn&quot;, which appeared in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in July 1992 and stated that &quot;To establish justice and to promote the general welfare, America does not need the abortion license. What America needs are policies that responsibly protect and advance the interest of mothers and their children, both before and after birth.&quot;

==Public service and political career==

===1950s===
In May 1954, Shriver was appointed to the Chicago Board of Education by Chicago mayor Martin H. Kennelly. On October 26, 1955, Shriver was chosen to serve as president of the Chicago Board of Education by a vote of the board. Shriver would serve in the position of president for five years, resigning from the position on October 10, 1960. At the time he became president of the board, he was the second-youngest individual to hold that office, being only 39. At the time, Chicago Public Schools was the second-largest school district in the United States.

Shriver also served as director of the Catholic Interracial Council, a group created to advocate for desegregation in Chicago schools.

Shriver considered several runs for statewide office. His first consideration was for the Democratic nomination in the 1956 Illinois gubernatorial election. Shriver had been courted by many Chicago Democrats, including Mayor Richard J. Daley, but ultimately chose to stay out of the election. The primary was won by Cook County treasurer Herbert C. Paschen, who would be forced to withdraw as the nominee after becoming embroiled in scandals surrounding his work as Treasurer. District Court Judge Richard B. Austin, was chosen as the replacement and went on to narrowly lose the election to incumbent Governor William Stratton.

===1960s===

In 1960, Shriver once again received serious courting by Democratic leaders in both Chicago and across the state to enter the Democratic primary for the 1960 Illinois gubernatorial election. Shriver even met with Mayor Daley and the Cook County Democratic Committee to gauge a possible run at Daley&#x27;s urging. However his father-in-law, Joseph P. Kennedy, told Shriver he would not be able to run or else he could seriously cripple the Presidential campaign of his brother-in-law, John F. Kennedy. His father-in-law cited the oversaturation of Catholic candidates in Illinois could cost the Democrats the state in November (Kennedy, Shriver, and Daley were all Catholic).

When John F. Kennedy ran for president, Shriver worked as a political and organization coordinator in the Wisconsin and West Virginia primaries. During Kennedy&#x27;s presidential term, Shriver founded and served as the first director of the Peace Corps from March 22, 1961, to February 28, 1966.

Shriver has been credited with convincing a hesitant Kennedy to contact Coretta Scott King after her husband, prominent civil rights activist Martin Luther King, was jailed for civil disobedience in Georgia in October 1960. Kennedy&#x27;s phone call to Coretta Scott King was credited with helping to strengthen black support for Kennedy&#x27;s candidacy.

After Kennedy&#x27;s assassination, Shriver continued to serve as Director of the Peace Corps and served as Special Assistant to President Lyndon Johnson. Under Johnson, he created the Office of Economic Opportunity and served as its first director. He is known as the &quot;architect&quot; of the Johnson administration&#x27;s &quot;War on Poverty&quot;. Hired by President Johnson to be the &quot;salesman&quot; for Johnson&#x27;s War on Poverty initiative, Shriver initially was &quot;not interested in hearing about community action proposals.&quot; The Job Corps movement was more consistent with his goals. Thus, soon after his appointment, Shriver &quot;moved quickly to reconsider the proposed anti-poverty initiative.&quot;

Shriver founded numerous social programs and organizations, including Head Start, VISTA, Job Corps, Community Action, Upward Bound, Foster Grandparents, Legal Services, the National Clearinghouse for Legal Services (now the Shriver Center), Indian and Migrant Opportunities and Neighborhood Health Services, in addition to directing the Peace Corps. He was active in the Special Olympics, which was founded in 1968 by his wife Eunice.

Shriver was awarded the Pacem in Terris Peace and Freedom Award in 1967. It was named after a 1963 encyclical letter by Pope John XXIII that calls upon all people of good will to secure peace among all nations. &quot;Pacem in terris&quot; is Latin for &#x27;Peace on Earth&#x27;.

In 1964 Shriver was considered one of the primary finalists on Johnson&#x27;s shortlist to be vice president. After weighing the benefits of Shriver as the second spot on the ticket, Johnson ultimately chose Hubert Humphrey. Shriver again considered running for Governor of Illinois in the 1964 Illinois gubernatorial election. However, he demurred after being asked by President Johnson to stay on and continue leading the creation of many of the aforementioned War on Poverty programs that would become part of the Great Society.

In 1968, Shriver was once again seriously courted by Illinois Democrats for both the 1968 Illinois gubernatorial election against increasingly unpopular incumbent Governor Otto Kerner, Jr. and the 1968 United States Senate election in Illinois against incumbent Republican Everett Dirksen. Shriver expressed little interest in serving in the Senate, not wanting to be overshadowed by his brothers-in-law Ted Kennedy and specifically Robert Kennedy, who he had expected to run for president in 1972. To move Shriver toward a run, Daley pitched to Illinois Democratic leaders and Shriver on recruiting Illinois State Treasurer Adlai E. Stevenson III to run for the Senate seat with Shriver running for Governor. Shriver even received Johnson&#x27;s blessing to make the run as part of Daley&#x27;s &quot;Dream Ticket&quot;, should he choose to do so. However, when Stevenson spoke out against the Vietnam War, Daley rejected Stevenson&#x27;s candidacy and again tried to recruit Shriver for the Senate seat. Johnson had offered Shriver the post of U.S. Ambassador to France, but asked for time to consider the offer, during which he considered his potential candidacy. When Stevenson lost Daley&#x27;s support for the Senate seat and began trying to recruit Shriver again, Shriver decided to accept Johnson&#x27;s offer of the Ambassadorship.

Shriver served as U.S. Ambassador to France from 1968 to 1970, becoming a quasi-celebrity among the French for bringing what &quot;Time&quot; magazine called &quot;a rare and welcome panache&quot; to the normally sedate world of international diplomacy. Upon returning to the United States in 1970, Shriver was speculated to be considering challenging incumbent Democratic Governor Marvin Mandel for the Democratic nomination for the 1970 Maryland gubernatorial election, reports he did nothing to dissuade despite Mandel&#x27;s sizable campaign fund and being the state&#x27;s first Jewish Governor. Mandel had been elected by the Maryland Legislature to finish out the term Spiro Agnew had been elected to in 1966, but resigned from after being elected Vice President in 1968. After traveling the state to gauge the support a potential candidacy might have, Shriver met with Mandel in the Governor&#x27;s office. After emerging from the meeting, Shriver declined to be a candidate. Mandel recalled years later, &quot;We had a long discussion, and when it was over, he wasn&#x27;t a candidate.&quot;

===Vice Presidential candidacy===
During the 1972 Democratic National Convention in Miami Beach, Florida, George McGovern considered Shriver as a vice presidential candidate, but his campaign was unable to reach Shriver, who was at the time visiting Moscow, Soviet Union. McGovern then selected Thomas Eagleton instead, who later resigned from the Democratic ticket following revelations of past mental health treatments. Shriver replaced Eagleton on the ticket. The McGovern-Shriver ticket lost to Republican incumbents Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew.

===Presidential candidacy===
Shriver unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1976. In the months before the primaries began, political observers thought that Shriver would draw strength from legions of former colleagues from the Peace Corps and the War on Poverty programs, and he was even seen as an inheritor of the Kennedy legacy, but neither theory proved true. His candidacy was short-lived and he returned to private life.

==Life after politics==

Shriver was a partner of the Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &amp; Jacobson law firm in Washington, D.C., where he specialized in international law and foreign affairs, beginning in 1971. He retired as partner in 1986 and was then named of counsel to the firm.

In 1981, Shriver was appointed to the Rockefeller University Council, an organization devoted exclusively to research and graduate education in the biomedical and related sciences.

In 1984, he was elected president of Special Olympics by the board of directors; as president, he directed the operation and international development of sports programs around the world. Six years later, in 1990, he was appointed chairman of the board of Special Olympics.

He was an investor in the Baltimore Orioles along with his eldest son Bobby Shriver, Eli Jacobs, and Larry Lucchino from 1989 to 1993.

==Illness and death==
Shriver was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in 2003. In 2004, his daughter, Maria, published a children&#x27;s book, &quot;What&#x27;s Happening to Grandpa?&quot;, to help explain Alzheimer&#x27;s to children. The book gives suggestions on how to help and to show love to an elderly person with the disease. In July 2007, Shriver&#x27;s son-in-law, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, speaking in favor of stem-cell research, said that Shriver&#x27;s Alzheimer&#x27;s disease had advanced to the point that &quot;Today, he does not even recognize his wife.&quot; Maria Shriver discusses her father&#x27;s worsening condition in a segment for the four-part 2009 HBO documentary series &quot;The Alzheimer&#x27;s Project&quot; called &quot;Grandpa, Do You Know Who I Am?&quot;, including describing a moment when she decided to stop trying to correct his various delusions.

On August 11, 2009, Shriver&#x27;s wife of 56 years, Eunice, died at the age of 88. He attended her wake and funeral in Centerville and Hyannis, Massachusetts. Two weeks later, on August 29, 2009, he attended the funeral of her brother Ted Kennedy in Boston, Massachusetts.

Shriver died on January 18, 2011, in Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, at age 95. Shriver&#x27;s family released a statement calling him &quot;a man of giant love, energy, enthusiasm, and commitment&quot; who &quot;lived to make the world a more joyful, faithful, and compassionate place.&quot; President Barack Obama also released a statement, calling Shriver &quot;one of the brightest lights of the greatest generation&quot;. Aaron S. Williams, the director of the Peace Corps, said in a statement, &quot;The entire Peace Corps community is deeply saddened by the passing of Sargent Shriver.&quot; He further noted that Shriver &quot;served as our founder, friend, and guiding light for the past 50 years&quot; and that &quot;his legacy of idealism will live on in the work of current and future Peace Corps volunteers.&quot; He is buried alongside his wife Eunice at St. Francis Xavier Cemetery in Centerville, Massachusetts.

==Legacy==
In 1968, he was awarded the Laetare Medal by the University of Notre Dame, the oldest and most prestigious award for American Catholics.

In 1993, Shriver received the Franklin D. Roosevelt Freedom From Want Award. On August 8, 1994, Shriver received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the United States&#x27; highest civilian honor, from President Bill Clinton.

In December 1993, the University of Maryland, Baltimore County created the Shriver Center in honor of Shriver and his wife. The center serves as the university&#x27;s civic engagement, and applied learning organization. The Shriver Center also is home to the Shriver Peaceworker Program and the Shriver Living Learning Community.

The Job Corps dedicated a center to his name in 1998 – the &quot;Shriver Job Corps Center&quot; – located in Devens, Massachusetts. The National Clearinghouse for Legal Services (renamed the National Center on Poverty Law in 1995) was renamed the Shriver Center in 2002 and each year awards a Sargent Shriver Award for Equal Justice.

Sargent Shriver Elementary School, located in Silver Spring, Maryland, is named after him.

In January 2008, a documentary film about Shriver aired on PBS, titled &quot;American Idealist: The Story of Sargent Shriver&quot;.

The Kennedy Shriver Aquatic Center in Bethesda, Maryland, is named after him and Eunice Kennedy Shriver.

Following his death, Daniel Larison wrote:
Shriver was an admirable, principled, and conscientious man who respected the dignity and sanctity of human life, and he also happened to be a contemporary and in-law of Kennedy. Not only did Shriver represent a &quot;link&quot; with JFK, but he represented a particular culture of white ethnic Catholic Democratic politics that has been gradually disappearing for the last fifty years. A pro-life Catholic, Shriver had been a founding member of the America First Committee, and more famously he was also on the 1972 antiwar ticket with George McGovern. In short, he represented much of what was good in the Democratic Party of his time.

<text>A bathroom is a room in which people wash their bodies or parts thereof. It can contain one or more of the following plumbing fixtures: a shower, a bathtub, a bidet, and a sink (also known as a wash basin in the UK). A toilet is also frequently included. There are also specific toilet rooms, only containing a toilet (often accompanied by a sink), which in North American English tend to be called &quot;bathrooms&quot;, &quot;powder rooms&quot; or &quot;washrooms&quot;, as euphemisms to conceal their actual purpose, while they in British and Irish English are known as just &quot;toilets&quot; or possibly &quot;cloakrooms&quot; - but also as &quot;lavatories&quot; when they are public.

Historically, bathing was often a collective activity, which took place in public baths. In some countries, the shared social aspect of cleansing the body is still important, for example with &quot;sento&quot; in Japan and, throughout the Islamic world, the hammam (also known in the West as a &quot;Turkish bath&quot;).

== Variations and terminology ==
The term for the place used to clean the body varies around the English-speaking world, as does the design of the room itself. A &quot;full bathroom&quot; generally contains a bath or shower (or both), a toilet, and a sink. An &quot;en suite bathroom&quot; or &quot;en suite shower room&quot; is attached to, and only accessible from, a bedroom. A &quot;family bathroom&quot;, in British estate agent terminology, is a full bathroom not attached to a bedroom, but with its door opening onto a corridor. A &quot;Jack and Jill bathroom&quot; (or &quot;connected bathroom&quot;) is situated between and usually shared by the occupants of two separate bedrooms. It may also have two wash basins. A &quot;wetroom&quot; is a waterproof room usually equipped with a shower; it is designed to eliminate moisture damage and is compatible with underfloor heating systems.

In the United States, there is a lack of a single definition. This commonly results in discrepancies between the advertised and actual number of baths in real estate listings. Bathrooms are generally categorized as &quot;master bathroom&quot;, containing a shower and a bathtub that is adjoining to the largest bedroom; a &quot;full bathroom&quot; (or &quot;full bath&quot;), containing four plumbing fixtures: a toilet and sink, and either a bathtub with a shower, or a bathtub and a separate shower stall; &quot;half bath&quot; (or &quot;powder room&quot;) containing just a toilet and sink; and &quot;3/4 bath&quot; containing toilet, sink, and shower, although the terms vary from market to market. In some U.S. markets, a toilet, sink, and shower are considered a &quot;full bath.&quot; In addition, there is the use of the word &quot;bathroom&quot; to describe a room containing a toilet and a basin, and nothing else.

In Canada, &quot;washroom&quot; is the preferred term for such a room, the same applies to public facilities.

==Design considerations==

===Towels===
Bathrooms often have one or more towel bars or rings for hanging towels.

=== Furniture ===
Some bathrooms contain a bathroom cabinet for personal hygiene products and medicines, and drawers or shelves (sometimes in column form) for storing towels and other items.

===Bidet===

Some bathrooms contain a bidet, which might be placed next to a toilet.

===Plumbing===
The bathroom design must account for the use of hot and cold water, in significant quantities, for cleaning the body. The water is also used for moving solid and liquid human waste to a sewer or septic tank. Water may be splashed on the walls and floor, and hot humid air may cause condensation on cold surfaces. From a decorating point of view, the bathroom presents a challenge. Ceiling, wall, and floor materials and coverings should be impervious to water and readily and easily cleaned. The use of ceramic or glass, as well as smooth plastic materials, is common in bathrooms for their ease of cleaning. Such surfaces are often cold to the touch, however, so water-resistant bath mats or even bathroom carpets may be used on the floor to make the room more comfortable. Alternatively, the floor may be heated, possibly by strategically placing resistive electric mats under the floor tile or radiant hot water tubing close to the underside of the floor surface.

===Electricity===
Electrical appliances, such as lights, heaters, and heated towel rails, generally need to be installed as fixtures, with permanent connections rather than plugs and sockets. This minimizes the risk of electric shock. Ground-fault circuit interrupter electrical sockets can reduce the risk of electric shock, and are required for bathroom socket installation by electrical and building codes in the United States and Canada. In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, only special sockets suitable for electric shavers and electric toothbrushes are permitted in bathrooms and are labelled as such.

UK building regulations also define what type of electrical fixtures, such as light fittings (i.e. how water-/splash-proof) may be installed in the areas (zones) around and above baths, and showers.

===Lighting===
Bathroom lighting should be uniform, and bright and must minimize glare. For all the activities like shaving, showering, grooming, etc. one must ensure equitable lighting across the entire bathroom space. The mirror area should have at least two sources of light at least 1 foot apart to eliminate any shadows on the face. Skin tones and hair color are highlighted with a tinge of yellow light. Ceiling and wall lights must be safe for use in a bathroom (electrical parts need to be splashproof) and therefore must carry appropriate certification such as IP44.

All forms of bathroom lighting should be IP44 rated as safe to use in the bathroom.

==History==

The first records for the use of baths date back as far as 3000 B.C. At this time water had a strong religious value, being seen as a purifying element for both body and soul. So it was not uncommon for people to be required to cleanse themselves before entering a sacred area. Baths are recorded as part of village or town life throughout this period, with a split between steam baths in Europe and America and cold baths in Asia. Communal baths were erected in a distinctly separate area from the living quarters of the village.

===Greek and Roman bathing===

The Roman attitudes towards bathing are well documented; they built large thermal baths (&quot;thermae&quot;), marking not only a significant social development but also providing a public source of relaxation and rejuvenation. Here was a place where people could meet to discuss the matters of the day and enjoy entertainment. During this period there was a distinction between private and public baths, with many wealthy families having their thermal baths in their houses. Despite this they still made use of the public baths, showing the value that they had as a public institution. The strength of the Roman Empire was telling in this respect; imports from throughout the world allowed Roman citizens to enjoy ointments, incense, combs, and mirrors. The partially reconstructed ruins can still be seen today, for example at Roman Baths (Bath) in Bath, England, then part of Roman Britain.

Not all ancient baths were in the style of the large pools that often come to mind when one imagines the Roman baths; the earliest surviving bathtub dates back to 1700 B.C and hails from the Palace of Knossos in Crete. What is remarkable about this tub is not only the similarity with the baths of today but also how the plumbing works surrounding it differ so little from modern models. A more advanced prehistoric (15th century BC and before) system of baths and plumbing is to be found in the excavated town of Akrotiri, on the Aegean island of Santorini (Thera). There, alabaster tubs and other bath fittings were found, along with a sophisticated twin plumbing system to transport hot and cold water separately. This was probably because of easy access to geothermic hot springs on this volcanic island.

Both the Greeks and the Romans recognized the value of bathing as an important part of their lifestyles. Writers such as Homer had their heroes bathe in warm water to regain their strength; it is perhaps notable that the mother of Achilles bathed him to gain his invincibility. Palaces have been uncovered throughout Greece with areas that are dedicated to bathing, spaces with ceramic bathtubs, as well as sophisticated drainage systems. Homer uses the word λοετρά, &quot;loetrá&quot;, &quot;baths&quot;, later λουτρά, &quot;loutrá&quot;, from the verb λούειν, &quot;loúein&quot;, to bathe. The same root finds an even earlier attestation on Linear B tablets, in the name of the River Lousios (&quot;bathing&quot; [river]), in Arcadia. Public baths are mentioned by the comedian Aristophanes as βαλανεία, &quot;balaneía&quot; (sing.: βαλανείον, &quot;balaneíon&quot;, Latinized as &quot;balneum&quot;, a &quot;balneary&quot;).

===16th century and beyond===
Throughout the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries, the use of public baths declined gradually in the West, and private spaces were favored, thus laying the foundations for the bathroom, as it was to become, in the 20th century. However, increased urbanization led to the creation of more baths and washhouses in Britain.

In Japan shared bathing in &quot;sento&quot; and &quot;onsen&quot; (spas) still exists, the latter being very popular.

Cultural historian Barbara Penner has written of the ambiguous nature of bathrooms as both the most private space and one most connected to the wider outside world.

<doc id="234516" wikidata="Q45803" url="?curid=234516" title="Dowry">
<text>A dowry is a payment such as land, property, money, livestock, or a commercial asset that is paid by the bride&#x27;s (woman&#x27;s) family to the groom (man) or his family at the time of marriage. 

Dowry contrasts with the related concepts of bride price and dower. While bride price or bride service is a payment by the groom, or his family, to the bride, or her family, dowry is the wealth transferred from the bride, or her family, to the groom, or his family. Similarly, dower is the property settled on the bride herself, by the groom at the time of marriage, and which remains under her ownership and control.

Traditionalist dowry is an ancient custom that is mentioned in some of the earliest writings, and its existence may well predate records of it. Dowries continue to be expected and demanded as a condition to accept a marriage proposal in some parts of the world, mainly in parts of Asia. The custom of dowry is most common in strongly patrilineal cultures that expect women to reside with or near their husband&#x27;s family (patrilocality). Dowries have long histories in Europe, South Asia, Africa, and other parts of the world.

==Definition==
A dowry is the transfer of parental property to a daughter at her marriage (i.e. &quot;inter vivos&quot;) rather than at the owner&#x27;s death (&quot;mortis causa&quot;). (This is a completely different definition of dowry to that given at the top of the article, which demonstrates how the term ‘dowry’ causes confusion.) A dowry (or dower) establishes a type of conjugal fund, the nature of which may vary widely. This fund may provide an element of financial security in widowhood or against a negligent husband, and may eventually go to provide for her children. Dowries may also go toward establishing a marital household, and therefore might include furnishings such as linens and furniture.

Locally, dowry or trousseau is called in Urdu, &quot;jahizie&quot;(also means prize not specifically dowry) in Persian and Arabic; &quot;dahej&quot; in Hindi, in Punjabi, &quot;daijo&quot; in Nepali, in Turkish, &quot;joutuk &quot; in Bengali, &quot;jiazhuang&quot; in Mandarin, &quot;varadhachanai&quot; in Tamil, &quot;khatnam&quot; in Telugu, &quot;streedhanam&quot; in Malayalam, &quot;miraz&quot; in Serbo-Croatian and in various parts of Africa is known as &quot;serotwana&quot;, &quot;idana&quot;, &quot;saduquat&quot; or &quot;mugtaf&quot;.

==Origins==
Anthropologist Jack Goody&#x27;s comparative study of dowry systems around the world utilizing the Ethnographic Atlas demonstrated that dowry is a form of inheritance found in the broad swath of Eurasian societies from Japan to Ireland that practice &quot;diverging devolution&quot;, i.e., that transmit property to children regardless of sex. This practice differs from the majority of Sub-Saharan African societies that practice &quot;homogenous inheritance&quot; in which property is transmitted only to children of the same sex as the property holder. These latter African societies are characterized by the transmission of the &quot;bride price&quot;, the money, goods or property given by the groom or his family to the parents of the bride (not the bride herself).

Goody has demonstrated a historical correlation between the practices of &quot;diverging devolution&quot; (dowry) and the development of intensive plough agriculture on the one hand, and homogeneous inheritance (brideprice) and extensive hoe agriculture on the other. Drawing on the work of Ester Boserup, Goody notes that the sexual division of labour varies in intensive plough agriculture and extensive shifting horticulture. In sparsely populated regions where shifting cultivation takes place, most of the work is done by women. These are the societies that give brideprice. Boserup further associates shifting horticulture with the practice of polygamy, and hence bridewealth is paid as a compensation to her family for the loss of her labour. In plough agriculture farming is largely men&#x27;s work; this is where dowry is given. In contrast, plough agriculture is associated with private property and marriage tends to be monogamous, to keep the property within the nuclear family. Close family are the preferred marriage partners so as to keep property within the group.

There is a scholarly debate on Goody&#x27;s theory. Sylvia Yanagisko argues, for example, that there are a number of societies including parts of Japan, Southern Italy, and China, that do not support Goody&#x27;s claim that dowry is a form of female inheritance of male property. She notes that Goody&#x27;s is an evolutionary model in which these historical variables may not be the decisive factors today. Susan Mann argues, in contrast, with examples where even in late Imperial China, dowry was a form of female inheritance.

Stanley J. Tambiah later argued that Goody&#x27;s overall thesis remained pertinent in North India, although it required modification to meet local circumstances. He points out that dowry in North India is only partially used as a bride&#x27;s conjugal fund, and that a large part goes directly to the groom&#x27;s joint family. This would initially seem to discount Goody&#x27;s model, except that in North India, the joint family is composed of the groom&#x27;s parents, his married brothers and unmarried sisters, and their third generation children. This joint family controlled this part of the dowry, which they used to help fund their own daughter/sister&#x27;s dowries. But when the parents die, and the joint family partitions, this jointly held wealth was then divided among the married sons, such that ultimately, the bride&#x27;s dowry given to the joint family returned to her and her husband as their &quot;conjugal fund.&quot;

Schlegel and Eloul expanded on Goody&#x27;s model through further statistical analysis of the Ethnographic atlas. They argue that a major factor in determining the type of marriage transaction is the type of property controlled by the household. Bridewealth circulates property and women, and is typical of societies where property is limited. Dowry concentrates property and is found in property owning classes or commercial or landed pastoral peoples. When families give dowry, they not only ensure their daughter&#x27;s economic security, they also &quot;buy&quot; the best possible husband for her, and son-in-law for themselves.

==Historical practices==
===Babylon===
Even in the oldest available records, such as the Code of Hammurabi in ancient Babylon, the dowry is described as an already-existing custom. Daughters did not normally inherit any of her father&#x27;s estate. Instead, with marriage, the bride got a dowry from her parents, which was intended to offer her as much lifetime security as her family could afford.

In Babylonia, both bride price and dowry auctions were practiced. However, bride price almost always became part of the dowry. According to Herodotus, auctions of maidens were held annually. The auctions began with the woman the auctioneer considered to be the most beautiful and progressed to the least. It was considered illegal to allow a daughter to be sold outside of the auction method. Attractive maidens were offered in an auction to determine the bride price to be paid by a swain, while in the case of maidens lacking attractivity a reverse auction was needed to determine the dowry to be paid to a swain. In case of divorce without reason, a man was required to give his wife the dowry she brought as well as the bride price the husband gave. The return of dowry could be disputed, if the divorce was for a reason allowed under Babylonian law.

A wife&#x27;s dowry was administered by her husband as part of the family assets. He had no say, however, in its ultimate disposal; and legally, the dowry had to be kept separate for it was expected to support the wife and her children. The wife was entitled to her dowry at her husband&#x27;s death. If she died childless, her dowry reverted to her family, that is her father if he was alive, otherwise her brothers. If she had sons, they would share it equally. Her dowry was inheritable only by her own children, not by her husband&#x27;s children or by other women.

===Ancient Greece===
In archaic Greece, the usual practice was to give a bride price (&quot;hédnon&quot; (&quot;ἕδνον&quot;)). Dowries (&quot;pherné&quot; (&quot;φερνή&quot;)) were exchanged by the later classical period (5th century B.C). A husband had certain property rights in his wife&#x27;s dowry. In addition, the wife might bring to the marriage property of her own, which was not included in the dowry and which was, as a result, hers alone. This property was &quot;beyond the dowry&quot; (Greek &quot;parapherna&quot;, the root of paraphernalia) and is referred to as paraphernal property or extra-dotal property.

A dowry may also have served as a form of protection for the wife against the possibility of ill treatment by her husband and his family, providing an incentive for the husband not to harm his wife. This would apply in cultures where a dowry was expected to be returned to the bride&#x27;s family if she died soon after marrying.

In contemporary Greece, dowry was removed from family law through legal reforms in 1983.

===Roman Empire===
The Romans practiced dowry (&quot;dos&quot;). The dowry was property transferred by the bride, or on her behalf by anyone else, to the groom or groom&#x27;s father, at their marriage. Dowry was a very common institution in Roman times, and it began out of a desire to get the bride&#x27;s family to contribute a share of the costs involved in setting up a new household. Dowry was given for the purpose of enabling the husband to sustain the charges of the marriage state (&quot;onera matrimonii&quot;). All the property of the wife which was not dowry, or was not a &quot;donatio propter nuptias&quot;, continued to be her own property, and was called &quot;parapherna&quot;. The dowry could include any form of property, given or promised at the time of marriage, but only what remained after deducting the debts. Not only the bride&#x27;s family, any person could donate his property as dowry for the woman.

Two types of dowry were known—&quot;dos profectitia&quot; and &quot;dos adventitia&quot;. That dowry is &quot;profectitia&quot; which was given by the father or father&#x27;s father of the bride. All other dowry is &quot;adventitia&quot;. Roman law also allowed for a species of dowry, called &quot;dos receptitia&quot;, which was given by some other person than the father or father of the bride&#x27;s father, in consideration of marriage, but on the condition that it should be restored back to the dowry giver, on the death of the wife. The bride&#x27;s family were expected to give a dowry when a girl married, and in proportion to their means. It was customary for the bride&#x27;s family and friends to pay promised dowries in installments over three years, and some Romans won great praise by delivering the dowry in one lump sum.

===Indian subcontinent===

The practice of dowry in the Indian subcontinent is a controversial subject. Some scholars believe dowry was practiced in antiquity, but some do not. Historical eyewitness reports (discussed below) suggest dowry in ancient India was insignificant, and daughters had inheritance rights, which by custom were exercised at the time of her marriage. Documentary evidence suggests that at the beginning of 20th century, bridewealth, rather than dowry was the common custom, which often resulted in poor boys remaining unmarried.

Stanley J. Tambiah claims the ancient Code of Manu sanctioned dowry and bridewealth in ancient India (typically in Rohtak) and especially in Kadia families, but dowry was the more prestigious form and associated with the Brahmanic (priestly) caste. Bridewealth was restricted to the lower castes, who were not allowed to give dowry. He cites two studies from the early 20th century with data to suggest that this pattern of dowry in upper castes and bridewealth in lower castes persisted through the first half of the 20th century. However, it is more likely that marriages involved both reciprocal gifts between the two families, claims Tambiah, so that insofar as the groom&#x27;s family gave the bridewealth, it tended to be given back as dowry to the bride as part of her conjugal estate.

Michael Witzel, in contrast, claims the ancient Indian literature suggests dowry practices were not significant during the Vedic period. Witzel also notes that women in ancient India had property inheritance rights either by appointment or when they had no brothers.

The findings of MacDonell and Keith are similar to Witzel, and differ from Tambiah; they cite ancient Indian literature suggesting bridewealth was paid even in brahma- and daiva-types of marriage associated with the Brahmanic (priestly) upper caste. Dowry was not infrequent, when the girl suffered from some bodily defect. Property rights for women increased in ancient India, suggest MacDonell and Keith, over the Epics era (200 BC – 700 AD). Kane claims ancient literature suggests bridewealth was paid only in the asura-type of marriage that was considered reprehensible and forbidden by Manu and other ancient Indian scribes. Lochtefeld suggests that religious duties listed by Manu and others, such as &#x27;the bride be richly adorned to celebrate marriage&#x27; were ceremonial dress and jewelry along with gifts that were her property, not property demanded by or meant for the groom; Lochtefeld further notes that bridal adornment is not currently considered as dowry in most people&#x27;s mind.

The above analysis by various scholars is based on interpreting verses of ancient Sanskrit scriptures from India, not eyewitness accounts. Available eyewitness observations from ancient India give a different picture. One of these are the eyewitness records from Alexander the Great&#x27;s conquest (&quot;ca&quot;. 300 BC), as recorded by Arrian and Megasthenes. Arrian&#x27;s first book mentions a lack of dowry,

Arrian&#x27;s second book similarly notes,

The two sources suggest dowry was absent, or infrequent enough to be noticed by Arrian. About 1200 years after Arrian&#x27;s visit, another eyewitness scholar visited India named Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī, also known as Al-Biruni, or Alberonius in Latin. Al-Biruni was an Islamic era Persian scholar who went and lived in India for 16 years from 1017 CE. He translated many Indian texts into Arabic, as well as wrote a memoir on Indian culture and life he observed. Al-Biruni claimed,

Al-Biruni further claims that a daughter, in 11th-century India, had legal right to inherit from her father, but only a fourth part of her brother. The daughter took this inheritance amount with her when she married, claimed Al-Biruni, and she had no rights to income from her parents after her marriage or to any additional inheritance after her father&#x27;s death. If her father died before her marriage, her guardian would first pay off her father&#x27;s debt, then allocate a fourth of the remaining wealth to her upkeep till she is ready to marry, and then give the rest to her to take with her into her married life.

===China===

Dowry was common in different historic periods of China and continued through the modern history. Locally called &quot; (), the dowry ranged from land, jewelry, money to a collection of clothing, sewing equipment and collection of household items. Mann and others find that dowry was a form of inheritance to daughters. In traditional China, the property owned by a family, if any, was earmarked for equal division or inheritance by sons only. Dowry was the only way assets were transferred to a daughter. It included immovable property such as land, and movable property like jewelry and fine clothing. The dowry she brought with her was typically sequestered from the property of her husband and other male members in a joint family. She would often sell this property for cash to overcome hard economic times or needs of her children and husband. In a few cases, she may transfer the property she brought as dowry to her daughter or daughter-in-law. Dowry assets once transferred in turn constituted separate wealth of the woman who received it (&quot;sifang qian&quot;, etc.). Often a woman who brought a large dowry was considered more virtuous in Chinese culture than one who didn&#x27;t. In parts of China, both dowry and brideprice (&quot;pinjin&quot;) were practiced from ancient eras to the 20th century. Though throughout the history of China, the practice of using a brideprice has largely been used instead of dowries, but has slowly diminished in modern times.

===Europe===
Dowry was widely practiced in Europe until the early modern era. Folklorists often interpret the folk tale &quot;Cinderella&quot; as the competition between the stepmother and the stepdaughter for resources, which may include the need to provide a dowry. Gioachino Rossini&#x27;s opera &quot;La Cenerentola&quot; makes this economic basis explicit: Don Magnifico wishes to make his own daughters&#x27; dowries larger, to attract a grander match, which is impossible if he must provide a third dowry.

One common penalty for the kidnapping and rape of an unmarried woman was that the abductor or rapist had to provide the woman&#x27;s dowry. Until the late 20th century this was sometimes called wreath money, or the breach of promise.
Providing dowries for poor women was regarded as a form of charity by wealthier parishioners. The custom of Christmas stockings springs from a legend of St Nicholas, in which he threw gold in the stockings of three poor sisters, thus providing for their dowries. St. Elizabeth of Portugal and St. Martin de Porres were particularly noted for providing such dowries, and the Archconfraternity of the Annunciation, a Roman charity dedicated to providing dowries, received the entire estate of Pope Urban VII. In 1425, the Republic of Florence created a public fund, called the &quot;Monte delle doti&quot;, to provide dowries to Florentine brides.

Vast inheritances were standard as dowries for aristocratic and royal brides in Europe during the Middle Ages. The Portuguese crown gave two cities in India and Morocco as dowry to the British Crown in 1661 when King Charles II of England married Catherine of Braganza, a princess of Portugal.

In some cases, nuns were required to bring a dowry when joining a convent. At some times, such as Ancien Régime France, convents were also used by some parents to put less attractive daughters, so that the more marriageable daughters could have larger dowries. Ancien Régime families that could not provide proper dowries also used the convents as places to put their daughters.

In the County of Bentheim in Lower Saxony, for instance, parents who had no sons might give a land dowry to their new son-in-law. It was commonly given with the condition that he take the surname of his bride, in order to continue the family name.

====England====
Dowry was used in England. However, the right of daughters to inherit and of women to hold property and other rights in their own name made it a different instrument than on the Continent. The Salic law, which required females to be disinherited and disenfranchised from land ownership, did not apply in England. Single women held many rights men did. The most famous example of this English female inheritance and agency right is perhaps Elizabeth I of England, who held all rights a male monarch did.

While single women held rights to hold property equivalent to those of men, marriage and married women were affected by the Norman Conquest changes to the law in the 12th century. Coverture was introduced to the common law in some jurisdictions, requiring property of a wife to be held in the husband&#x27;s name, custody and control. The Normans also introduced the dowry in England replacing the earlier custom of the new husband giving a morning gift to his bride. At first the husband publicly gave &quot;[or received?]&quot; the dowry at the church door at the wedding.

If the husband died first, which was frequent, there was a Widows dowry of one third of the husband&#x27;s lands at the time of his marriage; the income, and in some cases, the management, of the lands, was assigned to her for the rest of her life. This concept is included in the Great Charter, and along with the recognition of female inheritance and absence of the Salic law, and women, particularly single women, holding many rights equivalent to those men held, manifests English law differing fundamentally from the law of the Continent, especially the law of the Holy Roman Empire.

Thirteenth-century court records are filled with disputes over dowries, and the law became increasingly complex.

The English dowry system permitted most noble families to marry off their daughters and thereby gain extended kin and patronage ties. Marriageable daughters were a valuable commodity to ambitious fathers, and the English aristocracy sent few of their eligible daughters to convents.

Failure to provide a customary, or agreed-upon, dowry could cause a marriage to be called off. William Shakespeare made use of such an event in &quot;King Lear&quot;: one of Cordelia&#x27;s suitors gives up his suit upon hearing that King Lear will give her no dowry. In &quot;Measure for Measure&quot;, Claudio and Juliet&#x27;s premarital sex was brought about by their families&#x27; wrangling over dowry after the betrothal. Angelo&#x27;s motive for forswearing his betrothal with Mariana was the loss of her dowry at sea.

In Victorian England, dowries were viewed by some members of the upper class as an early payment of the daughter&#x27;s inheritance. In some instances, daughters who had not received their dowries were the only female heirs entitled to part of the estate when their parents died. If a couple died without children, a woman&#x27;s dowry was often returned to her family.

Coverture never applied universally in Britain and was repealed in the 1800s. This effectively ended the concept of dowry as the property of a single woman was either retained by her after marriage or its income became marital property under joint control with a husband (not under his sole control as in coverture).

====Russia====

In some parts of Europe, especially Eastern Europe, land dowries were common.

The &quot;Domostroy&quot;, a Russian advice book of the 16th century for upper classes, includes advice to set aside property for purposes of a dowry, and use it to accumulate linens, clothing, and other things for it, rather than have to suddenly buy it all for the wedding; if the daughter should happen to die, the dowry should be used to give alms and for prayers for her soul, although some might be set aside for other daughters. In late Tsarist Russia the dowry originally consisted of clothing for the bride, linen, and bedding. Linen became less common, a fact blamed on poor flax harvest and girls being poor spinners, but emphasis was added to the finest of the clothing, and a money dowry was sometimes added, particularly if the bride was regarded as having some fault. Prospective in-laws, usually concerned mostly with her working ability, grew more concerned about a money dowry.

====Romania====
In Romania in the late 18th and early 19th centuries (1750–1830s) the exclusion of dowered girls from the family inheritance led to increased cohesion within the nuclear family. The wife&#x27;s male relatives controlled the dowry but she retained sole ownership of the dowry and wedding gifts. Her relatives could prosecute the husband for squandering a dowry; wives gained some ability to leave an abusive marriage. The long-term result was a greater legal empowerment of women, while providing economic security to divorced women, widows, and children.

===The Americas===

====Indigenous cultures====
According to one ethnographic study of indigenous cultures worldwide, around six percent of North American indigenous cultures practised reciprocal exchange, involving the giving of gifts between both the bride and groom&#x27;s families. Among the tribes of the American Plains, a combination of dower and dowry was used. The groom would give a gift of horses to the bride&#x27;s parents, while they in turn would give a gift to the groom. The exchange was somewhat reciprocal.

====Mexico====
Spanish colonists brought the dowry custom to Mexico. Spain&#x27;s laws gave brides the right to control their dowry after marriage, contrary to the usual European practice of transferring the dowry to the control of the groom and his family. Women, in practice, often did maintain control over their dowry after marriage. The husband might be given funds from the dowry to invest for the mutual benefit of the couple and their children, but wives also often used funds from their dowries to operate their own businesses, as grocers, tavern keepers, and shop owners in urban areas. Dowries were a common custom in the early colonial years, but were passing out of use by the mid-18th century. By that time, less wealthy daughters were often marrying without any dowry.

====New France====
The French government made efforts to encourage marriage for the male soldiers and traders in New France by granting dowries to women willing to travel to the colony at Quebec. As the French crown provided dowries for many of the women persuaded to travel to New France for marriages and settlement there, they were known as &quot;filles du roi&quot; (daughters of the king).

Convents in Quebec, as in Europe, required a dowry from the parents of girls becoming nuns, much as the dowry was expected in the marriages of upper class brides. The Catholic Church and secular authorities intended for this requirement to regulate admission into religious communities. Girls without a dowry were often supported by benefactors, however, and occasionally convents lowered the sum required to enter the convent.

====United States====
The dowry was a custom brought to the United States by colonists from England and elsewhere in Europe. One legend tells how John Hull, the Master of the Mint in Boston and a wealthy man, determined the dowry for his daughter Hannah&#x27;s marriage to Samuel Sewall. Hull is said to have set his 18-year-old daughter onto one side of the large scales in his warehouse. He piled shillings into the other side of the scale until he reached her weight in silver, and that was her dowry.

The daughters of wealthy 19th-century industrialists, who were able to inherit large amounts of money and property, were given &quot;dowries&quot; by their fathers to marry European aristocrats who held a title but had little wealth. The mutual exchange of title and wealth raised the status of both bride and groom. A very good example is the marriage of Consuelo Vanderbilt to Charles Spencer-Churchill, 9th Duke of Marlborough in 1895.

====Brazil====
The dowry was a custom brought to Brazil by Portuguese settlers. Colonial economics meant that families had a great stake in inheritances of land in particular. As in Europe, the eldest daughter was usually granted the largest dowry by her father. Variations were not unusual, however, as research has shown in São Paulo, 31% of fathers gave dowries of increasing size to the younger daughters, and 21% distributed dowries with no particular favour shown to birth order of the daughters. In addition to dowries, daughters could also be granted an inheritance from their father, a share of the &quot;legìtima&quot;. Inheritance laws were complex in colonial Brazil. According to Portuguese law, an estate was to be divided among children who had not already received a dowry. In the early colonial period, married daughters receiving a large dowry would refuse to accept a further inheritance after the death of their father. In the 18th century, as inheritances and dowries gradually became smaller, this custom disappeared. Daughters accepted a dowry, plus a &quot;legìtima.&quot; In this way, they folded their dowry back into the estate with the &quot;legìtima&quot;, called bringing the dowry &quot;à colação&quot;. The remaining third of the estate, the &quot;terça&quot;, was free for the father to divide as he wished among his heirs.

There were instances where a daughter was left to marry without a dowry, whereas her sisters were given dowries, an indication of paternal control over marriage choices. During the 18th century, as inheritances decreased in size, litigation among siblings became more common. Dowries could include land, a house in the city, cash, gold dust, gold bars, tools and machinery, cattle, or horses. By the 19th century, economic changes meant that men, typically merchants, brought more to the marriage materially, and the economic dynamics of marriage changed.

==Current practices==
Dowry is a common practice in many parts of the world, especially in South Asia and several Middle East and North Africa countries. Dowry is most common in nations with inadequate male-biased inheritance laws and patrilineal societies, which expect women to live with or near their husband&#x27;s family. 
An unusual exception to the dowry custom in South Asia is found in Bhutan. The dowry system does not exist in Bhutan; inheritance is matrilineal, and daughters do not take their father&#x27;s name at birth, nor their husband&#x27;s name upon marriage. Rural land may be registered in a woman&#x27;s name. Women own businesses, and both polyandry and polygyny are socially accepted, with polygyny being more prevalent. Sometimes a prospective groom will work in the bride&#x27;s family&#x27;s household to earn the right to marry her.

===India===

In India, dowry is called &quot;Dahez&quot; in Hindi. In far eastern parts of India, dowry is called &quot;Aaunnpot&quot;. Dowry is a payment of cash or gifts from the bride&#x27;s family to the bridegroom&#x27;s family upon arranged marriage. It may include cash, jewelry, electrical appliances, furniture, bedding, crockery, utensils, car and other household items that help the newlyweds set up their home.

In India, the dowry puts great financial strain on the bride&#x27;s family. Payment of dowry is now prohibited under the &quot;Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961&quot; in Indian civil law and subsequently by Sections 304B and 498a of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Despite anti-dowry laws in India, it is still a common practice. Other laws attempting to address the problem include the &quot;Dowry and Bridal Gifts Restrictions Rules, 1976&quot; and the &quot;Dowry Prohibition (Maintenance of Lists of Presents to the Bride and Bridegroom) Rules, 1985&quot;, which are intended to document gifts and provide complainants with stronger evidence in case prosecution for crimes against the bride occurs later.

Dowry in India is widespread among all religions. Over the years, the practice has evolved and expanded in terms of scope and outreach. For example, Indian Muslims call dowry as &quot;jahez&quot;, and it is classified into two categories: The first comprises some essential articles for the outfit of the bride as well as for conjugal life. The other is made up of valuable goods, clothes, jewelry, an amount of money for the groom&#x27;s family, which is settled on after bargaining.

Although Indian laws against dowries have been in effect for decades, they have been largely criticised as being ineffective. The practice of dowry deaths and murders continues to take place unchecked in many parts of India and this has further added to the concerns of enforcement. Dowry-murder persists. It is the killing of a wife for not bringing sufficient dowry to the marriage. It is the culmination of a series of prior domestic abuses by the husband&#x27;s family.

Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code required the bridegroom and his family to be automatically arrested if a wife complains of dowry harassment. The law was widely abused and in 2014, the Supreme Court ruled that arrests can only be made with a magistrate&#x27;s approval.

===Bangladesh===
The original custom in Bangladesh was the bride price, called &quot;pawn&quot;, where the groom&#x27;s family makes a payment to the bride&#x27;s parents. This has gradually been replaced by the dowry, called &quot;joutuk&quot;. This transition in customs began in the 1960s. By the early 21st century, the bride price has been supplanted by the dowry. &quot;Joutuk&quot;, sometimes spelled &quot;Joutukh&quot;, like elsewhere in South Asia, is a serious and growing problem in Bangladesh. Between 0.6 and 2.8 brides per year per 100,000 women are reported to die because of dowry-related violence.

Bangladesh has seen a rise in the expected size of dowries in recent decades, as its middle class has grown. Sociologist Sarah White has argued that the dowry is not compensation for weakness in women&#x27;s economic contribution. Instead, its main function is now to support family advancement by mobilizing additional resources. It also demonstrates an ongoing commitment to the norms of masculine provision and protection. Dowries make women more valuable, which pushes against the background of widespread corruption and political and gender violence.

A negative factor is a rise in the rate of dowry deaths. In Bangladesh, dowry killings are more frequently done by stabbing or poison rather than burning. Dowry extortion is also a problem in Bangladesh. From January to October 2009, more than 3,413 complaints were made to the police in Bangladesh concerning beatings and other abuses related to dowries. One of the methods used by families who are unhappy with dowry includes acid throwing, in which concentrated acid is thrown on the bride&#x27;s face to cause disfiguration and social isolation. From 1995 to 1998, 15 women reported dowry disputes as the motivation behind acid attacks, though that number may be low due to underreporting. Bangladesh is combating the problem with legislation largely copied from that of India. Laws prohibiting dowry in Bangladesh include &quot;Dowry Prohibition Act, 1980&quot;; &quot;Dowry Prohibition (Amendment) Ordinance, 1982&quot;; and &quot;Dowry Prohibition (Amendment) Ordinance, 1986&quot;.

&quot;Dowry Prohibition Act&quot; Clause 4 states that anyone demanding dowry from a person has committed a crime. The law does not have any clause stating punishment to misuse it. Therefore, the law is frequently used by women to harass in-laws and husbands.

===Pakistan===
In Pakistan, dowry is called &quot;Jahez&quot; . A 2014 Gallup survey in Pakistan found that 84% of Pakistanis believe that dowry plays either very important or somewhat important role in marriage, while 69% believed it is not possible for a girl to get married without a dowry.

Pakistan has seen a rise in the values of dowries in recent decades, as in other South Asian countries. However, in Pakistan it is still expected that a bride will bring some kind of dowry with her to a marriage, whether she is Muslim, Hindu, or Christian. The Dower (bride price), called &quot;mahr&quot;, and dowry, called &quot;jahaiz&quot;, are both customs with long histories in Pakistan. Today, the dowry will often consist of jewelry, clothing, and money. Dowry is expected while the majority of marriages are consanguineously arranged between first cousins.

Control of the dowry belongs to the bride in theory, although in practice control often transfers to the husband and in-laws, and grooms sometimes extort large dowries. In rural Pakistan, dowry values are still relatively low, around 12 percent of a household&#x27;s annual (non-durable goods) expenses. Also, in rural Pakistan it is standard for the bride to maintain control over her dowry after marriage, rather than control of the dowry being given to the in-laws. A survey in January 2017 by Gallup Pakistan showed that 56 percent of the population expects the girl to bring dowry to marriage.The pressure among some Pakistanis to provide a large dowry results in some brides&#x27; families going into debt, including debt servitude; some brides build up their dowry with their own earnings if they work outside the home. The debt trap created by providing large dowries puts pressure on parents aspiring to arrange a marriage for their daughter(s) into a better social class. It is also cited as a reason for the current trend toward delayed marriages. Arranged marriages among first cousins are common, since they provide a way of keeping dowries within an extended family.

Pakistan has passed several laws to address the problem of excessive dowry demands: &quot;West Pakistan Dowry (Prohibition of Display) Act, 1967&quot;; &quot;Dowry and Bridal Gifts (Restriction) Act, 1976&quot;. Women&#x27;s rights to inheritance separate from the dowry are offered some protection in the &quot;Muslim Personal Law of Shariat of 1948&quot; and the &quot;Muslim Family Laws Ordinance of 1961&quot;. In October 2020, Pakistan became the first Muslim country to make it illegal to receive dowry as per the tenets of Islamic sunnah. According to the bill, the maximum amount to be given to the bride as her dowry may be no more than four tola gold, which may include clothes that belong to the bride, and bedsheets only. Guests arriving at the marriage ceremony will be banned from giving gifts costing more than .

===Nepal===
The practice of dowry is common in Nepal, and dowry-related violence is increasingly becoming a problem. As a result, the dowry system has been banned in Nepal. Despite the laws, the violent incidents continue, under a general perception of impunity. Nepali people of the Madhesi society still freely welcome dowry as a right to the groom&#x27;s side. Even highly educated people living in the Terai of Nepal accept dowry without any second thoughts. Parents have thus started dreading the birth of daughters in the family, going as far as determining the sex of fetuses in order to abort daughters. Many deaths have also been caused by not giving dowry to the groom&#x27;s side. Dowry system, however, is not practiced by indigenous people and is less prevalent in Hill Region.

In Nepal, the practice of dowry is closely related to social prestige; and dowry violence is especially prevalent in the Terai belt. In 2009, Nepal enacted the &quot;Social Customs and Practices Act&quot; outlawing dowry; however, there have been no known cases of enforcement.

===Sri Lanka===
Here, the dowry is known as &quot;dewedda&quot;. The payment of dowry in Sri Lanka has a strong tradition, and has been connected to family violence. However its importance is declining, and violence related to it is not as common as in other South Asian countries, though it still exists.

===Afghanistan===
Dowry is called &quot;Jehez&quot; in Afghanistan, and is separate from Mahr, &quot;sherbaha&quot;, and brideprice (locally called &quot;walwar&quot;, &quot;toyana&quot;, or &quot;qalyn&quot;).

A large dowry is sometimes expected, and given, in Afghanistan; some houses are almost emptied so that the daughter may make a grand show at the wedding. Items included in a dowry depend on the resources of the bride&#x27;s family and the demands made by the groom&#x27;s family. Embroidery is traditionally included in a dowry, as is land, money, jewelry such as necklaces and &quot;pazab&quot;, shoes, shawls, carpets, bedding, furniture, crockery, mirrors, clocks and such items. The dowry is transferred from bride&#x27;s family house to the groom&#x27;s family house one day before the wedding day in a ritual ceremony with band and a procession, which typically adopts the longest route in the residential area for the Afghan community to see the dowry being given by the bride&#x27;s family.

Afghanistan has both dowry and bride price, although the practice differs between different tribal and ethnic groups. In Afghanistan, a marriage typically requires two kinds of payments: a mahr, which typically consists of livestock, property and money, and in practice often takes the form of a bride price paid to the woman&#x27;s family; and a dowry brought by the bride to her husband&#x27;s home which may include various goods such as clothing, bedding and household utensils. The nature of dowry the bride brings often influences how she is treated when she arrives at her husband&#x27;s home. Parents frequently arrange marriages for daughters at a young age, in order to end their economic responsibility for their daughter.

===Iran===
Dowry has existed in Persia for over 1000 years, and called &quot;jahīzīeh&quot; (sometimes spelled &quot;jahaz&quot; or &quot;jaheez&quot;, جهیزیه). &quot;Jahiz&quot; is vestments, furniture, jewelry, cash and other paraphernalia a bride&#x27;s family gives to the bride to take with her to the groom&#x27;s family. Jahiz is separate from Mahr required by Sharia religious laws, as well as the traditional payment of &quot;Shir Baha&quot; (literally: price of milk), in rural Iran. Dowry-related violence and deaths in Iran are reported in Iranian newspapers, some of which appear in English media.

===Turkey===
Dowry is known as &quot;çeyiz&quot; in Turkey. &quot;Çeyiz&quot; is the property and/or money the bride&#x27;s family gives the couple at marriage. Çeyiz is different and separate from the &quot;Mahr&quot;, which is paid by the groom to the bride, or traditional &quot;baslik&quot; in some parts of Turkey. The giving of dowry has been replaced with the exchanging of gifts at the marriage ceremony by family members in modern times.

Çeyiz often includes furnishings, appliances, clothing, gold jewelry, cash and other items depending on the resources of the Turkish family. Some of the Turkish dowry remains with the couple after marriage, other is specifically meant for the groom&#x27;s family and relatives. The &quot;çeyiz&quot; is typically agreed upon between the groom&#x27;s and bride&#x27;s families before the wedding date is finalized. According to tradition, even in current times, the dowry is displayed for showing-off, before the marriage in rural Turkey, at the bride&#x27;s family, or groom&#x27;s family—the display is typically attended and examined by women, particularly from the groom&#x27;s family. In some cases, if the groom&#x27;s family is not satisfied with the displayed dowry, the wedding is cancelled. The dowry is transferred, from the bride&#x27;s family to the groom&#x27;s family just before the wedding in a ceremonial ritual. Thereafter, the wedding is completed.

Scholars and government agencies claim significant domestic violence in Turkish population due to dowry disputes. Violence and property claims related disputes are more frequent if there is a divorce.

=== Thailand ===
In Thailand, it is a common practice for men to give dowry which is called &quot;สินสอด&quot; (&quot;sin-sot&quot;) in Thailand. Dowry is usually given by the groom to the parents of the bride before or during the wedding. This is often in the form of money or gold.

===Azerbaijan===
Dowry is known as &quot;cehiz&quot; in Azerbaijan. &quot;Cehiz&quot; is the property and money the bride&#x27;s family must give to the groom&#x27;s family prior to marriage. &quot;Cehiz&quot; is separate from the money under &quot;Mahr&quot; required under Sharia religious requirements in Islamic Azerbaijan. &quot;Cehiz&quot; often includes furnishings, appliances, crystal, mirrors, bed, jewelry and cash depending on the negotiations between the groom&#x27;s and bride&#x27;s families before the wedding day. While the groom&#x27;s family receives &quot;Cehiz&quot;, the bride receives &quot;Mahr&quot;. Relatives of the bride often contribute to the &quot;Cehiz&quot; demands, through the ritual of &quot;koncas&quot;. Dowry is transferred a few days before the wedding, and examined by groom&#x27;s family, and a &quot;Siyahı&quot; (receipt) for the dowry is issued by the groom&#x27;s family; this helps avoid disputes. If some items of the dowry are not satisfactory, the wedding may be delayed or cancelled. Similar traditions continue in many regions of Caucasus, including non-Muslim ethnic groups.

===Tajikistan===
Dowries are sometimes expected in Tajikistan, and they often consist of a collection of traditional dresses which are on display on the wedding day. However, the practice is much less common than in other parts of the Persophone world, as Tajikistan has a strong history of secularism due to it being a former Soviet republic.

===Egypt===
In Egypt, dowry is known as &quot;Gehaz&quot;. This is the property a bride is expected to bring with her at marriage, and it is different from the dower (Mahr) paid by the groom to the bride per requirements of sharia. &quot;Gehaz&quot; is observed in rural and urban Egypt, and is typically negotiated between the groom&#x27;s family and bride&#x27;s. &quot;Gehaz&quot; includes furniture, appliances, jewelry, china, bedding and various household items. Families begin collecting dowry years before a girl is betrothed. Many Egyptian girls take up jobs so as to save money necessary to meet the expected dowry demands.

While the dowry is given during the marriage, in rural Egypt, it is ritually displayed to the village prior to the marriage. Every piece of the &quot;gehaz&quot; is placed on open cars that go around the village several times, with music, in order to show off the dowry being given by the bride&#x27;s family to the groom. The &quot;gehaz&quot; show off ritual is also a means to enhance the bride&#x27;s status within her new marital family.

===Morocco===

Dowry is a traditional and current practice in Morocco, and is called &quot;shura&quot;, &quot;shawar&quot;, &quot;ssdaq&quot; or &quot;amerwas&quot; depending on the speaker&#x27;s region and ethnicity (e.g. Arabic, Berber, etc.). Dowry in Morocco is separate from the &quot;Mahr&quot; or &quot;Sadaq&quot; that is religiously required by Sharia.

Centuries ago, &quot;Mahr&quot; and &quot;Sadaq&quot; meant something different in Morocco. &quot;Mahr&quot; was the purchase price paid for the bride by the groom&#x27;s family to the bride&#x27;s father or guardian, while &quot;Sadaq&quot; was the betrothal gift offered by groom to the bride. Over time, the difference vanished and they are now one and the same, but different from the practice of dowry.

In modern times, the Moroccan practice is to split the so-called &quot;Sadaq&quot;, which meets the Islamic requirement of &quot;Mahr&quot;, into two parts: &quot;naqd&quot; (cash) and &quot;kali&quot; (remainder Mahr). The &quot;Naqd Sadaq&quot; is paid by the groom&#x27;s family to bride&#x27;s family before the wedding. The bride&#x27;s family supplements the &quot;Naqd&quot; amount with an equal or greater amount of cash, and gives dowry (called &quot;shura&quot;, &quot;shawar&quot; or &quot;amerwas&quot;). This dowry typically includes furniture, clothing, appliances, beds, household items, divans, jewelry, and other property. The dowry amounts are negotiated before the wedding. Higher dowry and lower Mahr are expected for widows and divorcées than for virgins. If elders of the two families do not agree on the dowry amount, the marriage is typically delayed or cancelled. The value and composition of the dowry varies according to social class, family wealth and regional customs. The &quot;kali al-sadaq&quot; (sometimes called &quot;mwahhar&quot; in Northern Morocco) is paid later, to technically meet the requirements of &quot;Mahr&quot; under Islamic Sharia. The &quot;shura&quot; (dowry) far exceeds the &quot;kali al-sadaq&quot;, and there is a large transfer of wealth from bride&#x27;s family to the couple and the groom&#x27;s family.

===Bosnia===
Dowry is an old custom known as &quot;oprema&quot; in Bosnia. In neighboring regions, it is sometimes called &quot;prikija&quot; or &quot;ženinstvo&quot;. Another term &quot;miraz&quot; is used sometimes, but &quot;immigrant&quot; is also used to mean inheritance, something different from dowry.

&quot;Oprema&quot; refers to the property the bride&#x27;s parents give her as part of the marriage. It often includes furniture, kitchenware, decorative items, gold jewelry and other items. Oprema is also different from &quot;pohod&quot; (gift giving, &quot;dar&quot;) ritual of Bosnia, as well as the &quot;ruho&quot; (embroidered clothing) ritual. Oprema is discussed between the groom&#x27;s and bride&#x27;s family before the marriage; the groom&#x27;s family sets the quality and quantity expectations. The &quot;oprema&quot; is typically not displayed to those who attend the wedding. Oprema and &quot;dar&quot; are a major economic burden to bride&#x27;s family in Bosnia. Poorer families spend years saving money and buying &quot;oprema&quot; in order to get their daughter(s) married.

===Serbia===
Dowry is not a Slavic custom; medieval Serbia was first exposed to it by the Byzantines. During the Ottoman era, dowry was non existent. Although the custom might have had limited adoption in the 19th century, the communist regime outlawed dowry. It&#x27;s possible that the custom may have survived in some rural areas to this day among the Romani population.

==Violence against women and international perspectives==

Disputes related to dowry sometimes result in violence against women, including killings and acid attacks. Amnesty International has stated:
The Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women classifies violence against women into three categories: that occurring in the family (DV), that occurring within the general community, and that perpetrated or condoned by the State. Family violence is defined as follows:

Kirti Singh states, &quot;Dowry is widely considered to be both a cause and a consequence of son preference. The practice of dowry inevitably leads to discrimination in different areas against daughters and makes them vulnerable to various forms of violence.&quot; Singh suggests this may lead to girls being unwanted, sex-selective abortion, or her parents may abandon or mistreat her after she is born. UNICEF notes dowry helps perpetuate child marriage. The World Health Organization (WHO) has expressed concern for dowry-related femicide, citing the study by Virendra Kumar which argued that dowry deaths occur primarily in areas of the Indian subcontinent. They note the estimates for actual number of dowry deaths per year vary widely ranging from 600 to 750 homicides a year to 25,000 homicides a year, with official government records suggesting 7,618 deaths in 2006. Rakhshinda Perveen states thousands of dowry-related bride burning cases in Pakistan, yet few prosecutions and rare convictions for dowry-related violence against women.

UNODC includes dowry deaths as a form of gender-based violence. About 4.6% of total crimes against women in India were dowry death-related, and another 1.9% were related to violation of &quot;Dowry Prohibition Act&quot;. The dowry death rate in India has been about 0.7 women per 100,000 every year from 1998 to 2009.

<text>The king of Assyria (Akkadian: , later ) was the ruler of the ancient Mesopotamian kingdom of Assyria, which was founded in the late 21st century BC and fell in the late 7th century BC. For much of its early history, Assyria was little more than a city-state, centered on the city Assur, but from the 14th century BC onwards, Assyria rose under a series of warrior kings to become one of the major political powers of the Ancient Near East, and in its last few centuries it dominated the region as the largest empire the world had seen thus far. Ancient Assyrian history is typically divided into the Old, Middle and Neo-Assyrian periods, all marked by ages of ascendancy and decline.

The ancient Assyrians did not believe that their king was divine himself, but saw their ruler as the vicar of their principal deity, Ashur, and as his chief representative on Earth. In their worldview, Assyria represented a place of order while lands not governed by the Assyrian king (and by extension, the god Ashur) were seen as places of chaos and disorder. As such it was seen as the king&#x27;s duty to expand the borders of Assyria and bring order and civilization to lands perceived as uncivilized. As Assyria expanded, its rulers gradually adopted grander and more boastful titles. Early kings used (representative/viceroy of Ashur), considering the god Ashur to be the true king. From the time of Ashur-uballit I (14th century BC), the rulers instead used king (). In time, further titles, such as &quot;king of Sumer and Akkad&quot;, &quot;king of the Universe&quot; and &quot;king of the Four Corners of the World&quot;, were added, often to assert their control over all of Mesopotamia.

All modern lists of Assyrian kings generally follow the Assyrian King List, a list kept and developed by the ancient Assyrians themselves over the course of several centuries. Though some parts of the list are probably fictional, the list accords well with Hittite, Babylonian and ancient Egyptian king lists and with the archaeological record, and is generally considered reliable for the age. The line of Assyrian kings ended with the defeat of Assyria&#x27;s final king Ashur-uballit II by the Neo-Babylonian Empire and the Median Empire in 609 BC, after which Assyria disappeared as an independent political unit, never to rise again. The Assyrian people survived the fall of their empire and kept their own cultural and religious traditions (though were Christianized in the 1st–3rd centuries AD). At times, Assur and other Assyrian cities were afforded great deals of autonomy by its foreign rulers after the 7th century BC, particularly under the Achaemenid and Parthian empires.

== Introduction ==
=== Sources ===

Incomplete king-lists have been recovered from three of the major ancient Assyrian capitals (Assur, Dur-Sharrukin and Nineveh). The three lists are largely consistent with each other, all originally copies of a single original list, and are based on the yearly appointments of -officials (the eponymous officials for each year, appointed by the king to preside over the celebration of the New Year festival). Because of the consistency between the list and the method through which it was created, modern scholars usually accept the regnal years mentioned as more or less correct. There are some differences between the copies of the list, notably in that they offer somewhat diverging regnal years before the reign of king Ashur-dan I of the Middle Assyrian Empire (reign beginning in 1178 BC). After his time, the lists are identical in their contents.

The king-lists mostly accord well with Hittite, Babylonian and ancient Egyptian king lists and with the archaeological record, and are generally considered reliable for the age. It is however clear that parts of the list are fictional, as some known kings are not found on the list and other listed kings are not independently verified. Originally it was assumed that the list was first written in the time of Shamshi-Adad I 1800 BC but it now is considered to date from much later, probably from the time of Ashurnasirpal I (1049–1031 BC). The oldest of the surviving king-lists, List A (8th century BC) stops at Tiglath-Pileser II (967–935 BC) and the youngest, List C, stops at Shalmaneser V (727–722 BC).

One problem that arises with the Assyrian King List is that the creation of the list may have been more motivated by political interest than actual chronological and historical accuracy. In times of civil strife and confusion, the list still adheres to a single royal line of descent, probably ignoring rival claimants to the throne. Additionally, there are some known inconsistencies between the list and actual inscriptions by Assyrian kings, often regarding dynastic relationships. For instance, Ashur-nirari II is stated by the list to be the son of his predecessor Enlil-Nasir II, but from inscriptions it is known that he was actually the son of Ashur-rabi I and brother of Enlil-Nasir.

=== Titles ===
Assyrian royal titles typically followed trends that had begun under the Akkadian Empire ( 2334–2154 BC), the Mesopotamian civilization that preceded the later kingdoms of Assyria and Babylon. When the Mesopotamian central government under the Third Dynasty of Ur ( 2112–2004 BC) collapsed and polities that had once been vassals to Ur became independent, many of the new sovereign rulers refrained from taking the title of king (), instead applying that title to their principal deities (in the case of Assyria, Ashur). For this reason, most of the Assyrian kings of the Old Assyrian period ( 2025–1364 BC) used the title , translating to &quot;governor of Assyria&quot;.

In contrast to the titles employed by the Babylonian kings in the south, which typically focused on the protective role and the piety of the king, Assyrian royal inscriptions tend to glorify the strength and power of the king. Assyrian titularies usually also often emphasize the royal genaeology of the king, something Babylonian titularies do not, and also drive home the king&#x27;s moral and physical qualities while downplaying his role in the judicial system. Assyrian epithets about royal lineage vary in how far they stretch back, most often simply discussing lineage in terms of &quot;son of ...&quot; or &quot;brother of ...&quot;. Some cases display lineage stretching back much further, Shamash-shum-ukin (667–648 BC) describes himself as a &quot;descendant of Sargon II&quot;, his great-grandfather. More extremely, Esarhaddon (681–669 BC) calls himself a &quot;descendant of the eternal seed of Bel-bani&quot;, a king who lived more than a thousand years before him.

Assyrian royal titularies were often changed depending on where the titles were to be displayed, the titles of the same Assyrian king would have been different in their home country of Assyria and in conquered regions. Those Neo-Assyrian kings who controlled the city of Babylon used a &quot;hybrid&quot; titulary of sorts in the south, combining aspects of the Assyrian and Babylonian tradition, similar to how the traditional Babylonian deities were promoted in the south alongside the Assyrian main deity of Ashur. The assumption of many traditional southern titles, including the ancient &quot;king of Sumer and Akkad&quot; and the boastful &quot;king of the Universe&quot; and &quot;king of the Four Corners of the World&quot;, by the Assyrian kings served to legitimize their rule and assert their control over Babylon and lower Mesopotamia. Epithets like &quot;chosen by the god Marduk and the goddess Sarpanit&quot; and &quot;favourite of the god Ashur and the goddess Mullissu&quot;, both assumed by Esarhaddon, illustrate that he was both Assyrian (Ashur and Mullissu, the main pair of Assyrian deities) and a legitimate ruler over Babylon (Marduk and Sarpanit, the main pair of Babylonian deities).

To exemplify an Assyrian royal title from the time Assyria ruled all of Mesopotamia, the titulature preserved in one of Esarhaddon&#x27;s inscriptions reads as follows:
=== Role of the Assyrian king ===

Ancient Assyria was an absolute monarchy, with the king believed to be appointed directly through divine right by the chief deity, Ashur. The Assyrians believed that the king was the link between the gods and the earthly realm. As such, it was the king&#x27;s primary duty to discover the will of the gods and enact this, often through the construction of temples or waging war. To aid the king with this duty, there was a number of priests at the royal court trained in reading and interpreting signs from the gods.

The heartland of the Assyrian realm, Assyria itself, was thought to represent a serene and perfect place of order whilst the lands governed by foreign powers were perceived as infested with disorder and chaos. The peoples of these &quot;outer&quot; lands were seen as uncivilized, strange and as speaking strange languages. Because the king was the earthly link to the gods, it was his duty to spread order throughout the world through the military conquest of these strange and chaotic countries. As such, imperial expansion was not just expansion for expansion&#x27;s sake but was also seen as a process of bringing divine order and destroying chaos to create civilization.

There exists several ancient inscriptions in which the god Ashur explicitly orders kings to extend the borders of Assyria. A text from the reign of Tukulti-Ninurta I ( 1243–1207 BC) states that the king received a royal scepter and was commanded to &quot;broaden the land of Ashur&quot;. A similar inscription from the reign of Ashurbanipal (668–631 BC) commands the king to &quot;extend the land at his feet&quot;.

The king was also tasked with protecting his own people, often being referred to as a &quot;shepherd&quot;. This protection included defending against external enemies and defending citizens from dangerous wild animals. To the Assyrians, the most dangerous animal of all was the lion, used (similarly to foreign powers) as an example of chaos and disorder due to their aggressive nature. To prove themselves worthy of rule and illustrate that they were competent protectors, Assyrian kings engaged in ritual lion hunts. Lion-hunting was reserved for Assyrian royalty and was a public event, staged at parks in or near the Assyrian cities. In some cases, the hunt even took place with captive lions in an arena.

=== Legitimacy ===
As opposed to some other ancient monarchies, such as ancient Egypt, the Assyrian king was not believed to be divine himself, but was seen as divinely chosen and uniquely qualified for the royal duties. Most kings stressed their legitimacy through their familial connections to previous kings; a king was legitimate through his relation to the previous line of great kings who had been chosen by Ashur. Usurpers who were unrelated to previous kings usually either simply lied about being the son of some previous monarch or claimed that they had been divinely appointed directly by Ashur.

Two prominent examples of such usurpers are the kings Tiglath-Pileser III (745–727 BC) and Sargon II (722–705 BC). The inscriptions of these kings completely lack any familial references to previous kings, instead stressing that Ashur himself had appointed them directly with phrases such as &quot;Ashur called my name&quot;, &quot;Ashur placed me on the throne&quot; and &quot;Ashur placed his merciless weapon in my hand&quot;.

=== Early Assyrian rulers ===
==== Early names in king lists ====
The Assyrian King List includes a long sequence of rulers before Assyria&#x27;s first confidently attested kings (of the Puzur-Ashur dynasty), though it is suspected by modern scholars that at least portions of this line of rulers are invented since none of the names are attested in contemporary records and many of the names of the earliest rulers rhyme (suggesting an invented pattern). This is further corroborated by the absence of certain figures in the list known to have ruled in Assur before the Puzur-Ashur dynasty (the governors under Assur&#x27;s foreign rulers). The Synchronistic King List diverges from the Assyrian King. Though it includes earlier names, the Assyrian King List does not list the length of the rule of any king before Erishum I.

Given that the earliest rulers are described as &quot;kings who lived in tents&quot;, they, if real, may not have ruled Assur at all but rather have been nomadic tribal chieftains somewhere in its vicinity. As in the &quot;Sumerian King List&quot;, several names may also have belonged to rulers who were contemporaries/rivals, rather than successors and predecessors of one another. Some researchers have dismissed these names as a mixture of Amorite tribal-geographical names with no relation to Assyria at all. It is possible that the &#x27;kings who were ancestors&#x27;, who are not attested in any other sources as present at Assur, refer to the ancestors of Shamshi-Adad I ( 1808–1776 BC), given that other sources claim that his father was named Ilu-kabkabu, and they might thus not have been kings of Assyria, but rather rulers of Terqa, Shamshi-Adad&#x27;s supposed ancestral home. Including these figures may have served to justify Shamshi-Adad&#x27;s rise to the throne, either through obscuring his non-Assyrian origins or through inserting his ancestors into the sequence of Assyrian kings. 

The early portion of the Assyrian King List contains these otherwise historically unverified names:

Kings who lived in tents

# Tudiya
# Adamu
# Yangi
# Suhlamu
# Harharu
# Mandaru
# Imsu
# Harsu
# Didanu
# Hana

Kings who were ancestors

The kings are listed in reverse order in the AKL, starting from Aminu and ending with Apiashal(who is also included in the list of kings 
who lived in tents).


Kings named on bricks

There are six of them, including three kings that are part of the Old Assyrian empire from Puzur-Ashur I to Ilu-shuma.

==== Attested early rulers ====
A handful of early local rulers of Assur under foreign suzerainty are known from contemporary sources from before the time of Puzur-Ashur I. The precise dates of the highly incomplete sequence of figures listed below are unknown and none of them appear among the rulers before Puzur-Ashur I in the king list. Perhaps their absence could be explained by these figures not being considered to be proper kings. Several are however attested with the title &quot;supreme judge&quot; () a title probably equivalent to and sometimes used by later kings.
=== Puzur-Ashur dynasty (2025–1809 BC) ===

The dynasty founded by Puzur-Ashur is conventionally known by modern historians as the &#x27;Puzur-Ashur dynasty&#x27; after its founder. Puzur-Ashur I is generally seen as the founder of Assyria as an independent city-state 2025 BC. Some historians on the other hand speculate that Puzur-Ashur was not a new dynastic founder, but that his dynasty actually began earlier, perhaps by Sulili. The dynasty has thus also been termed the &#x27;Sulili–Puzur-Ashur dynasty&#x27;. The dynasty has also been referred to simply as the &#x27;Old Assyrian dynasty&#x27;. These kings, beginning with Puzur-Ashur I, took power in the aftermath of the collapse of the Neo-Sumerian Empire, which had ruled over Assyria.

=== Shamshi-Adad dynasty (1808–1736 BC) ===

The dynasty founded by Shamshi-Adad I, who deposed the Puzur-Ashur dynasty, is conventionally known as the &#x27;Shamshi-Adad dynasty&#x27;, after its founder. During the rule of Shamshi-Adad I and his successors, of Amorite descent and originally from the south, a more absolute form of kingship, inspired by that of Babylon, was introduced in Assyria. During the preceding Puzur-Ashur dynasty, royal power in Assur had been more limited than in other cities, with inscriptions describing how the king worked in tandem with the city assembly to establish law and order. The earliest use of the term (king) in Assyrian inscriptions comes from Shamshi-Adad I&#x27;s reign. Shamshi-Adad I was also the first Assyrian king to assume the title &#x27;king of the Universe&#x27;, though these styles fell into a long period of disuse again after his death. The short-lived realm founded by Shamshi-Adad I is sometimes referred to as the Kingdom of Upper Mesopotamia.

=== Non-dynastic usurpers (1735–1701 BC) ===

=== Adaside dynasty (1700–722 BC) ===

The dynasty founded by Bel-bani, which ruled Assyria throughout most of its history, is conventionally known as the Adaside or Adasi dynasty, after Bel-bani&#x27;s father. In Babylonia, this dynasty of kings was called the &quot;Baltil dynasty&quot;, Baltil being the oldest portion of the city of Assur.
=== Sargonid dynasty (722–609 BC) ===


== Later Assyrian kingship ==
=== Geopolitical history and context ===
The defeat of Ashur-uballit II at Harran in 609 BC marked the end of the ancient Assyrian monarchy, which was never restored. The territory of the Assyrian Empire was split between the Neo-Babylonian and Median empires. The Assyrian people survived the fall of the empire, though Assyria continued to be a sparsely populated and marginal region under the Neo-Babylonian and later Achaemenid empires. Under the Seleucid and Parthian empires, Assyria experienced a remarkable recovery. Under the last two or so centuries of Parthian rule, archaeological surveys have shown that the region reached a density of settlements that is only comparable to what the region was like under the Neo-Assyrian Empire.

A semi-autonomous city-state under Parthian suzerainty appears to have formed around the city of Assur, Assyria&#x27;s oldest capital, near, or shortly after, the end of the 2nd century BC. In this period, the ancient city flourished, with some old buildings being restored and some new ones, such as a new palace, being constructed. The ancient temple dedicated to the god Ashur was also restored for the second time in the second century AD, and a cultic calendar effectively identical to that used under the Neo-Assyrian Empire was used. Stelae erected by the local rulers of Assur in this time resemble the stelae erected by the Neo-Assyrian kings, though the rulers are depicted in Parthian-style trouser-suits rather than ancient garb. The rulers used the title of Assur (&quot;master of Assur&quot;) and appear to have viewed themselves as continuing the old Assyrian royal tradition. These stelae retain the shape, framing and placement (often in city gates) of stelae erected under the ancient kings and also depict the central figure in reverence of the moon and sun, an ever-present motif in the ancient royal stelae. This second period of prominent Assyrian cultural development at Assur came to end with the conquests of the Sasanian Empire in the region, 240, whereafter the Ashur temple was destroyed again and the city&#x27;s people were dispersed.

=== City-lords of Assur ===
The sequence of local rulers of Assur under the three or four centuries of Parthian suzerainty is poorly known. Only five names are attested and their dates, their precise order and how they relate to each other is not clear. The order used here follows Aggoula (1985). There are large gaps in this sequence.

<text>Muztagh Tower (), also Mustagh Tower; &quot;Muztagh&quot;: icy mountain), is a mountain situated in Baltoro Muztagh, which is a segment of the Karakoram range. It straddles the border of the Gilgit–Baltistan region of Pakistan and the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China. Muztagh Tower is located between the basins of the Baltoro and Sarpo Laggo glaciers.

==Early prominence==

The Mustagh Tower gained attention through a photograph captured by Vittorio Sella during the 1909 Italian expedition to K2. The picture was taken from the upper Baltoro, from a vantage point located due southeast of the mountain. In this photograph, the twin summits of Mustagh Tower appeared perfectly aligned, giving the mountain the appearance of a slender tooth and making it seem extremely impregnable. This image was featured in a book on mountaineering in 1941 with the caption &quot;The Last Citadel&quot;.

==First and second ascents==
Nearly five decades after Vittorio Sella&#x27;s photograph was taken, in 1956, his image served as inspiration for two separate expeditions that raced to achieve the first ascent of Mustagh Tower. Interestingly, both teams discovered that the mountain&#x27;s routes were less steep than what Sella&#x27;s photograph had suggested. The British expedition, consisting of John Hartog, Joe Brown, Tom Patey and Ian McNaught-Davis, approached the peak from the Chagaran Glacier on the west side and successfully reached the summit via the Northwest Ridge on July 6. They achieved this feat five days ahead of the French team, consisting of Guido Magnone, fr:Robert Paragot, André Contamine, and Paul Keller, who climbed the mountain from the east. François Florence waited for the two parties at the camp IV during 42 hours without a radio, when they went, reached the summit and came back to this camp.

==Notable ascents and attempts==
* 1984 &quot;Northwest Ridge&quot; 2nd of route, 3rd of peak by Mal Duff, Tony Brindle, Jon Tinker and Sandy Allan (all UK).
* 1990 The fourth ascent was made by Göran Kropp and Rafael Jensen.

A lower summit, was first climbed in 1984 by the northeast ridge.

* 2008 On 24 August 2008, the &quot;Northeast Face&quot; was climbed by two Slovenian alpinists, Pavle Kozjek and Dejan Miškovič. They bivouacked on the crest after 17 hours of climbing. They decided not to go to the summit because of strong wind. Just after they started descending, Kozjek fell to his death.
* 2012 On the day of 25 August, 56 years after the day when the first man climbed to the top of this mountain, three Russians made an ascent by the centre &quot;Northeast Face&quot;. Sergei Nilov, Dmitry Golovchenko and Alexander Lange reached the top and made a new route. The ascent lasted for 17 days.

<doc id="234523" wikidata="Q217170" url="?curid=234523" title="Proselytism">
<text>Proselytism () is the policy of attempting to convert people&#x27;s religious or political beliefs. Carrying out attempts to instill beliefs can be called proselytization.

Sally Sledge discusses religious proselytization as the marketing of religious messages. Proselytism is illegal in some countries. Some draw distinctions between &quot;evangelism&quot; (or &quot;da&#x27;wah&quot; in Islamic terminology) and proselytism, regarding proselytism as involuntary or coerced; the two terms can also be understood to merely be synonyms.

==Etymology==
The English-language word &quot;proselytize&quot; derives from the Greek language prefix (, &quot;toward&quot;) and the verb (, &quot;I come&quot;) in the form of (, &quot;newcomer&quot;). Historically, in the Koine Greek Septuagint and New Testament, the word &quot;proselyte&quot; denoted a Gentile who was considering conversion to Judaism. Although the word &quot;proselytism&quot; originally referred to converting to Judaism (and earlier related to Gentiles such as God-fearers), it now implies an attempt of any religion or religious individuals to convert people to their belief.

Arthur J. Serratelli, the Catholic Bishop of Paterson, New Jersey, observed that the meaning of the word &quot;proselytism&quot; has changed over time.
[O]riginally, the Greek Septuagint translation of the Old Testament passed the word &#x27;proselyte&#x27; into modern languages with a neutral meaning. It simply meant a convert, someone who changed his or her opinion or religion. And, proselytism meant the attempt to persuade someone to make such a change. But, today proselytism is almost universally seen as a sinister activity when it comes to religious beliefs.

The World Council of Churches has indicated that, when used pejoratively, &quot;proselytism&quot; refers to attempts at conversion by &quot;unjust means that violate the conscience of the human person&quot;, such as by coercion or bribery.

==Limits==
The right to change religion and to manifest religion is protected under Article 18 of the UN Declaration of Human Rights. Limitations and regulations on proselytism are considered by some as infringements on freedom of religion and freedom of speech.

Some countries such as Greece prohibited all proselytism until 1994 when Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses were legally recognized as a religion and allowed to preach. Some countries such as Morocco prohibit it except for Islam. Some restrict it in various ways such as prohibiting attempts to convert children or prohibit offering physical benefits to new converts.

Religious groups also draw lines between what they are willing to do or not do to convert people. For instance the Catholic Church in &quot;Ad gentes&quot; states that &quot;The Church strictly forbids forcing anyone to embrace the Faith, or alluring or enticing people by worrisome wiles.&quot;

The World Council of Churches in &quot;The Challenge of Proselytism and the Calling to Common Witness&quot; states the following:

19. Proselytism as described in this document stands in opposition to all ecumenical effort. It includes certain activities which often aim at having people change their church affiliation and which we believe must be avoided, such as the following:
*making unjust or uncharitable references to other churches&#x27; beliefs and practices and even ridiculing them;
*comparing two Christian communities by emphasizing the achievements and ideals of one, and the weaknesses and practical problems of the other;
*employing any kind of physical violence, moral compulsion and psychological pressure e.g. the use of certain advertising techniques in mass media that might bring undue pressure on readers/viewers;
*using political, social and economic power as a means of winning new members for one&#x27;s own church;
*extending explicit or implicit offers of education, health care or material inducements or using financial resources with the intent of making converts;
*manipulative attitudes and practices that exploit people&#x27;s needs, weaknesses or lack of education especially in situations of distress, and fail to respect their freedom and human dignity.
==By faith==
The religions of the world are divided into two groups: those that actively seek new followers (missionary religions like Christianity) and those that do not (non-missionary religions). This classification dates back to a lecture given by Max Müller in 1873 and is based on whether or not a religion seeks to gain new converts. The three main religions classified as missionary religions are Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam, while the non-missionary religions include Judaism, Zoroastrianism, and Hinduism. Other religions, such as Primal Religions, Confucianism, and Taoism, may also be considered non-missionary religions.

===Baháʼí Faith===
In the writings of the Baháʼí Faith, the endeavour to attract people to the religion is strongly emphasized. The process of attracting people to the religion is referred to as teaching. The term &quot;proselytism&quot; is given the connotation of aggressively teaching the religion to others – as such, Bahaʼi proselytism is prohibited.

Every Bahaʼi is obligated to teach their religion, as it is seen as the path toward bringing peace and justice to the world. Some Bahaʼis become pioneers, moving to countries or cities where there are a small number of Bahaʼis, with the aim of helping to spread the religion. Some other Bahaʼis move from place to place in a process called travel teaching. When moving or travelling to other countries, Bahaʼis are encouraged to integrate into their new society and apply Bahaʼis principles in living and working with their neighbours. However, only a small minority of Bahaʼis are directly teaching their religion to others. Despite this, as of 2010, the religion had grown &quot;at least twice as fast as the population of almost every UN region&quot; over the previous 100 years.

Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh, the founder of the Bahaʼi Faith, wrote that those who would be teaching his religion should emphasize the importance of ethics and wisdom, and he counselled Bahaʼis to be unrestrained and put their trust in God. At the same time, he stated that Bahaʼis should exercise moderation, tact, and wisdom and not be too aggressive in their teaching. In sharing their faith with others, Bahaʼis are cautioned to ensure the person they are proposing to teach is open to hearing what they say. In most countries, becoming a Bahaʼi is simply filling out a card stating a declaration of belief. This includes acknowledgement of Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;llah as the messenger of God for this age, awareness and acceptance of his teachings, and intention to be obedient to the institutions and laws he established. It does not involve negating one&#x27;s previous beliefs due to the Bahaʼi belief in progressive revelation.

===Christianity===

Many Christians consider it their obligation to follow what is often termed the Great Commission in the final verses of the Gospel of Matthew: &quot;Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit: Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen.&quot; The Acts of the Apostles and other sources contain several accounts of early Christians following this directive by engaging in individual conversations and mass sermons to spread the Good News.

Most self-described Christian groups have organizations devoted to missionary work, which in whole or in part includes proselytism of the non-religious and people of other faiths (including sometimes other variants of Christianity). Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are known in particular for their doctrinal emphasis on proselytizing.

The Moscow Patriarchate has repeatedly strongly condemned what it describes as Catholic proselytism of Orthodox Christians within Russia and has therefore opposed a Catholic construction project in an area of Russia where the Catholic community is small. The Catholic Church claims that it is supporting the existing Catholic community within Russia and is not proselytizing. In 1993 the Balamand declaration on proselytism was released between the Roman Catholic Church and Orthodox Churches.

====Muggletonians====
The Muggletonians, founded by John Reeve and Lodowick Muggleton in mid-17th century London, believed that if a person were exposed to the full tenets of their faith and rejected it, they would be irretrievably damned. This risk tempered proselytization: they hesitated to expose people to loss of salvation, which may explain their low numbers. In the mid-19th century, two wealthy Muggletonians, Joseph and Isaac Frost, broke with this cautious approach and published several books about the faith.

===Indian religions===

Proselytization is uncommon in Indian religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism, especially because they are pluralistic. Instead of the choice of religion, justice is viewed as being determined by concepts such as karma and rebirth. Thus, proselytism is seen as unhelpful towards the pursuit of &quot;sādhanā&quot; (spiritual practice) and &quot;samskaras&quot; (intrinsic qualities).

====Buddhism====

Buddhism has no accepted or strong proselytism tradition, with the Buddha teaching his followers to respect other religions and the clergy. Emperor Ashoka, however, sent imperial missionaries to various kingdoms and sent his son and daughter as missionaries to Sri Lanka following his conversion to Buddhism. Aggressive proselytizing is discouraged in the major Buddhist schools and Buddhists do not engage in the practice of proselytization.

Some adherents of Nichiren Buddhism proselytise in a process called &quot;shakubuku&quot;.

The Dalai Lama has critiqued proselytization and certain types of conversion, believing the practices to be contrary to the fundamental ideas of religious harmony and spiritual practice. He has stated that &quot;It&#x27;s very important that our religious traditions live in harmony with one another and I don&#x27;t think proselytizing contributes to this. Just as fighting and killing in the name of religion are very sad, it&#x27;s not appropriate to use religion as a ground or a means for defeating others.&quot; In particular, he has critiqued Christian approaches to conversion in Asia, stating that he has &quot;come across situations where serving the people is a cover for proselytization.&quot; The Dalai Lama has labeled such practices counter to the &quot;message of Christ&quot; and has emphasized that such individuals &quot;practice conversion like a kind of war against peoples and cultures.&quot; In a statement with Hindu religious leaders, he expressed that he opposes &quot;conversions by any religious tradition using various methods of enticement.&quot;

====Hinduism====

Hinduism has a proselytism tradition. Classical Hinduism represents a diversity of views and theology. Its followers are free to follow any among the theistic, non-theistic or other traditions within Hinduism. Followers can pick or change to any philosophy or belief they fancy and worship any personal god or goddess in a manner they deem fit, given an unspoken but loud understanding that all paths are equally valid in their purest form. Religious conversion from and to Hinduism has been controversial in the modern era. Many state the concept of missionary activity and proselytism is anathema to the precepts of Hinduism.

While proselytism was not a part of the Hindu tradition, religious conversion to and between various traditions within Hinduism, such as Vaishnavism, Shaivism, and Shaktism, has a long history. However, these traditions of conversion did not have to do with an idea that was more objectively valid or the potential consequences of false ideas in the afterlife, but which was more conducive to understanding the unknowable Brahman and promoting righteousness throughout society.

The debate on proselytization and religious conversion between Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism is more recent and started in the 19th century. Religious leaders of some Hindu reform movements such as the Arya Samaj launched the &quot;Shuddhi&quot; movement to proselytize and reconvert Muslims and Christians back to Hinduism, while those such as the Brahmo Samaj suggested Hinduism to be a non-missionary religion. All these sects of Hinduism have welcomed new members to their group, while other leaders of Hinduism&#x27;s diverse schools have stated that given the intensive proselytization activities from missionary Islam and Christianity, this &quot;there is no such thing as proselytism in Hinduism&quot; view must be re-examined.

=====Hare Krishna Movement=====
One group that takes in willing converts in Hinduism is the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), also known as Hare Krishnas. Devotees have no codified conversion rituals but promote recitation of the Hare Krishna mantra as a means to achieve a mature stage of love of God. ISKCON adherents view Krishna as the supreme deity that those of other faith traditions worship. A commonly accepted notion among devotees is that ISKCON allows one to recognize the primacy of the supreme deity, Krishna, in the practices and traditions of other faiths. ISKCON promotes the concept of Sanatana-Dharma (Hinduism), the &#x27;eternal law&#x27; that other faiths can uncover.

====Jainism====
Mahavira (599–527 BC), the 24th Tirthankara of Jainism, developed an early philosophy regarding relativism and subjectivism known as &quot;Anekantavada&quot;. As a result of this acceptance of alternative religious practices, the phenomenon of proselytization is largely absent in these religions but not unknown. Converts are welcome to the Jain faith.

====Sikhism====

Sikhism is not a proselytizing religion and proselytism is largely discouraged &quot;through force or inducement&quot; out of the belief that each person has a fundamental right to practice their religion freely.

===Islam===

In Islam, inviting people to the religion is meritorious. The Quran states,
The operative phrase /lā ikrāha fī d-dīni/ literally translates as “there is to be no compulsion in religion.” “Ikrāh” is the gerund attached to the verb “akraha,” among whose meanings is “he compelled (another to do something he hates doing).” Muslim scholars consider this passage to mean that force is not to be used to convert someone to Islam. Muslims consider inviting others to Islam to be the mission originally carried out by the prophets of Allah and is now a collective duty of Muslims. The Quran states, 

Here, the operative phrase /udʿu ilà sabīli rabbika/ &quot;Invite (command to a single male subject) to the way of your Lord&quot; expresses the element direction /ilà/ &quot;to&quot; that is missing in &#x27;The Cow&#x27;, 2:256.

===Judaism===

An important tenet of Judaism is that God&#x27;s will allows people to exercise free will. As such, proselytizing is generally regarded as offensive in Judaism. Consequently, Judaism does typically not proselytize non-Jews. Instead, non-Jews are encouraged to follow the Seven Laws of Noah, assuring them a place in the world to come. In ancient times, these observant non-Jews could become &quot;geirim toshvim&quot;, a term still sometimes used informally to refer to those who strive to follow these laws and who will join the Jewish people in the world to come. A non-Jew who follows Noahide law is considered to believe in Noahidism; for this end, there is some minor outreach by Orthodox Jewish organizations.

Generally, Jews expect any convert to Judaism to come through their own accord. A common source of converts are those who have married a Jew, but many people join for spiritual or other personal reasons; these people are called &quot;Jews by choice&quot;. Rabbis will often discourage new members from pursuing conversion but may provide guidance through courses or personal meetings for those who are truly interested. Orthodox Judaism in theory neither encourages nor discourages conversion. Standards for conversion can be very challenging, but rabbis will acquiesce to persistent and sincere requests for conversion. Much emphasis is placed on gaining a Jewish identity.

Although most Jewish organizations do not proselytize, Chabad practices Orthodox Judaism outreach to halachic Jews who are not observant.

===Inherited membership===

Sects of some religions, such as the Druze, Yazidis, and Yarsans, do not accept converts at all.

<doc id="234524" wikidata="Q176980" url="?curid=234524" title="List of kings of Akkad">
<text>The king of Akkad (Akkadian: , ) was the ruler of the city of Akkad and its empire, in ancient Mesopotamia. In the 3rd millennium BC, from the reign of Sargon of Akkad to the reign of his great-grandson Shar-Kali-Sharri, the Akkadian Empire represented the dominant power in Mesopotamia and the first known great empire.

The empire would rapidly collapse following the rule of its first five kings, owing to internal instability and foreign invasion, probably resulting in Mesopotamia re-fracturing into independent city-states, but the power that Akkad had briefly exerted ensured that its prestige and legacy would be claimed by monarchs for centuries to come. Ur-Nammu of Ur, who founded the Neo-Sumerian Empire and reunified most of Mesopotamia, created the title &quot;King of Sumer and Akkad&quot; which would be used until the days of the Achaemenid Empire.

== History ==
Although Sargon of Akkad is often referred to as the &quot;founder&quot; of Akkad, the city itself probably existed before his rule; a pre-Sargonic inscription refers to it by name and the name &quot;Akkad&quot; itself is not actually of the Akkadian language of Sargon and his successors. Sargon&#x27;s reign does however mark the transition of Akkad from a city-state into the first known great empire, with the Akkadian king ruling all Mesopotamia. His rise to power began with the defeat of the Sumerian king Lugal-zage-si, who had ruled Lower Mesopotamia from Uruk, and the conquest of his empire. Through military campaigns, Sargon subjugated regions as far west as the Mediterranean and as far north as Assyria, which he boasted of in his inscriptions.

Sargon&#x27;s successors consolidated his vast realm and continued expanding the borders of the Akkadian Empire. Sargon&#x27;s grandson and the fourth king of Akkad, Naram-Sin, brought the empire to its greatest extent and assumed a new title to illustrate his great power, &quot;King of the Four Quarters&quot;, which referenced the entire world. He was also the first king in Mesopotamia to be deified in his lifetime, being addressed as &quot;the god of Akkad&quot;.

Although at least seven kings would rule Akkad after him, the Akkadian Empire quickly collapsed after Naram-Sin&#x27;s reign and prominent central authority under a single king would not be restored in Mesopotamia until the rise of the Neo-Sumerian Empire. It&#x27;s likely that the region reverted to local governance under kings of city-states in the time between the two empires. A major cause of this collapse was the invasion of Mesopotamia by a people referred to as the Gutians, who would be defeated and driven away by the founder of the Neo-Sumerian Empire, Ur-Nammu.

==List of rulers==
The following list should not be considered complete:
== King of Sumer and Akkad ==
Although Akkad and what remained of its empire was destroyed, its power and prominence led to rulers of later Mesopotamian empires wishing to claim its prestige and legacy for themselves. Ur-Nammu, who founded the Neo-Sumerian Empire in the aftermath of the Gutian rule of Mesopotamia assumed the title &quot;King of Sumer and Akkad&quot;. Although the title was meant to justify his rule over both southern (Sumer) and northern (Akkad) Mesopotamia, it also clearly connected Ur-Nammu to the old Akkadian kings, who may have been against linking Sumer and Akkad in such a fashion even though they had ruled both regions.

Ur-Nammu&#x27;s title would endure for more than 1,500 years. It was assumed by Hammurabi, founder of the Old Babylonian Empire, and used by Babylonian kings up until the 8th century BC. It was also prominently used in the Middle and Neo-Assyrian Empires and in the Neo-Babylonian Empire. For Assyrian kings, &quot;King of Sumer and Akkad&quot; was used as a marker of their control of Babylon (which was in the South, e.g. Sumer) and only those Assyrian kings who actually controlled Babylon used the title in their inscriptions.

The final king to assume the title of &quot;King of Sumer and Akkad&quot; was Cyrus the Great of the Achaemenid Empire, who reigned from 559 to 530 BC. In the Cyrus Cylinder, written in Akkadian cuneiform script following Cyrus&#x27;s conquest of Babylon, he assumed several traditional Mesopotamian royal titles, most of which were not used by his successors.

<doc id="234526" wikidata="Q283321" url="?curid=234526" title="List of Frankish kings">
<text>The Franks, Germanic-speaking peoples that invaded the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century, were first led by individuals called dukes and reguli. The earliest group of Franks that rose to prominence was the Salian Merovingians, who conquered most of Roman Gaul, as well as the Gaulish territory of the Visigothic Kingdom, following the Battle of Vouillé in 507 AD.

The sons of Clovis I, the first King of the Franks, conquered the Burgundian and the Alamanni Kingdoms. They acquired Provence, and went on to make the peoples of the Bavarii and Thuringii their clients. The Merovingians were later replaced by the new Carolingian dynasty in the 8th century. By the late 10th century, the Carolingians themselves had been replaced throughout much of their realm by other dynasties.

A timeline of Frankish rulers has been difficult to trace since the realm, according to old Germanic practice, was frequently divided among the sons of a king upon the king&#x27;s death. However, territories were eventually reunited through marriage, treaty or conquest. There were often multiple Frankish kings who ruled different territories, and divisions of the territories were not very consistent over time.

As inheritance traditions changed over time, the divisions of Francia (the lands of the Franks) started to become kingdoms that were more permanent. West Francia formed the heart of what was to become the Kingdom of France; East Francia evolved into the Kingdom of Germany; and Middle Francia became the Kingdom of Lotharingia in the north, the Kingdom of Italy in the south, and the Kingdom of Provence in the west. West and East Francia soon divided up the area of Middle Francia.

The idea of a &quot;King of the Franks&quot; (&quot;Rex Francorum)&quot; gradually disappeared. The title &quot;King of the Franks&quot; is attested in the Kingdom of France until 1190, that of &quot;Queen of the Franks&quot; (for queen consorts) until 1227. That represented a shift in thinking about the monarchy from that of a popular monarchy, the leader of a people, sometimes without a defined territory to rule, to that of a monarchy tied to a specific territory.

== Early Frankish rulers ==

* Genobaud (3rd century?)
* Merogais and Ascaric (4th century)
* Marcomer (4th century), &quot;dux&quot;
* Sunno (4th century), &quot;dux&quot;
* Genobaud (4th century), &quot;dux&quot;
* Mallobaudes (4th century)
* Theodemer (5th century)
* Ragnachar (died 509), killed by Clovis
* Chararic (died 509), killed by Clovis

=== Salian Franks ===

* Chlodio (5th century)
* Merovech ( 450–457), perhaps a son of Chlodio
* Childeric I ( 457–481), son of Merovech
* Clovis I ( 481–511), the first Merovingian king, who united all Franks by 509

=== Ripuarian Franks ===

* Childebert (5th century)
* Sigobert the Lame (died 509), killed at the instigation of Clovis 
* Chlodoric the Parricide (died 509), son of Sigobert, killed by Clovis

== Merovingian dynasty ==
=== Early Kings of the Franks (509–613) ===
Clovis I united all the Frankish petty kingdoms as well as most of Roman Gaul under his rule, conquering the Domain of Soissons of the Roman general Syagrius as well as the Visigothic Kingdom of Toulouse (Aquitaine). He took his seat at Paris, which along with Soissons, Reims, Metz, and Orléans became the chief residences. Upon his death, his four sons – and later his grandsons – split the kingdom among them. Every son received a part of the original Frankish territory and also a part of the newly acquired Aquitaine.

===Kings in Neustria and Burgundy (613–679)===

Chlothar II defeated Brunhilda and her great-grandson, Sigibert II, reunifying the kingdom. By that time the realms of Neustria, Burgundy and Austrasia had developed regional identities. In order to appease the local nobility, Austrasia was usually ruled by separate king, often a son or brother of the king ruling in Neustria and Burgundy. A similar arrangement for Aquitaine was short-lived.

===Kings in Austrasia (623–679)===

Chlothar II had reunified the kingdom in 613. By that time the realms of Neustria, Burgundy and Austrasia had developed regional identities. In order to appease the local nobility, Clothar made his young son, Dagobert I, king of Austrasia. Austrasia was usually ruled by a separate king, often a son or brother of the king ruling in Neustria and Burgundy, for the following decades.

===Later Kings of the Franks (679–751)===

Theuderic III was recognized as king of all the Franks in 679. From then on, the kingdom of the Franks can be treated as a unit again for all but a very brief period of civil war. This is the period of the &quot;roi fainéant&quot;, &quot;do-nothing kings&quot; who were increasingly overshadowed by their mayors of the palace.

==Carolingian dynasty==

The Carolingians were initially mayors of the palace under the Merovingian kings, first in Austrasia and later in Neustria and Burgundy. In 687 Pepin of Heristal took the title Duke and Prince of the Franks (&quot;dux et princeps Francorum&quot;) after his conquest of Neustria in at the Battle of Tertry, which was cited by contemporary chroniclers as the beginning of Pepin&#x27;s reign. Between 715 and 716, the descendants of Pepin disputed the succession.

Finally, in 747 Pepin the Short became Mayor of the Palace of Austrasia in addition to that of Neustria, making him ruler of the entire Frankish kingdom. He arranged for the deposition of the Merovingian king Childeric III and in March 752, Pepin was himself anointed King of the Franks. The office of Mayor was absorbed into the Crown, and this marked the start of the Carolingians as the ruling dynasty. Charlemagne was crowned emperor in the year 800, beginning the line of Holy Roman Emperors that lasted (with some interruptions) until 1806, although the title was held by German monarchs after 962.

Louis the Pious made many divisions of his empire during his lifetime. The final division, pronounced at Worms in 838, made Charles the Bald heir to the west, including Aquitaine, and Lothair heir to the east, including Italy and excluding Bavaria, which was left for Louis the German. However, following the emperor&#x27;s death in 840, the empire was plunged into a civil war that lasted three years. The Frankish kingdom was then divided by the Treaty of Verdun in 843. Lothair was allowed to keep his imperial title and his kingdom of Italy, and granted the newly created Kingdom of Middle Francia, a corridor of land stretching from Italy to the North Sea, and including the Low Countries, the Rhineland (including Aachen), Burgundy, and Provence. Charles was confirmed in Aquitaine, where Pepin I&#x27;s son Pepin II was opposing him, and granted West Francia (modern France), the lands west of Lothair&#x27;s Kingdom. Louis the German was confirmed in Bavaria and granted East Francia (modern Germany), the lands east of Lothair&#x27;s kingdom.

The following table does not provide a complete listing for some of the various &quot;regna&quot; of the empire, especially those who were &quot;subregna&quot; of the Western, Middle, or Eastern kingdom such as Italy, Provence, Neustria, and Aquitaine.

*The history of France as recounted in the &quot;Grandes Chroniques de France&quot;, and particularly in the personal copy produced for King Charles V between 1370 and 1380 that is the saga of the three great dynasties, the Merovingians, Carolingians, and the Capetians, that shaped the institutions and the frontiers of the realm. This document was produced and likely commissioned during the Hundred Years&#x27; War, a dynastic struggle between the rulers of France and England with rival claims to the French throne. It should therefore be read and considered carefully as a source, due to the inherent bias in the context of its origins.

<doc id="234527" wikidata="Q2743935" url="?curid=234527" title="Anthem (novella)">
<text>Anthem is a dystopian fiction novella by Russian–American writer Ayn Rand, written in 1937 and first published in 1938 in the United Kingdom. The story takes place at an unspecified future date when mankind has entered another Dark Age. Technological advancement is now carefully planned and the concept of individuality has been eliminated. A young man known as Equality 7-2521 rebels by doing secret scientific research. When his activity is discovered, he flees into the wilderness and is followed by Liberty 5-3000, a woman he loves. Together they plan to establish a new society based on rediscovered individualism.

Rand originally conceived of the story as a play, then decided to write for magazine publication. At her agent&#x27;s suggestion, she submitted it to book publishers. The novella was first published by Cassell in England. It was published in the United States only after Rand&#x27;s next novel, &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;, became a best seller. Rand revised the text for the US edition published in 1946.

==Plot==

Equality 7-2521, a 21-year-old man writing by candlelight in a tunnel under the earth, tells the story of his life up to that point. He exclusively uses plural pronouns (&quot;we&quot;, &quot;our&quot;, &quot;they&quot;) to refer to himself and others. He was raised like all children in his society, away from his parents in collective homes: the Home of Infants from birth until five years old, then the Home of Students from five to fifteen. He believes he has a &quot;curse&quot; that makes him learn quickly and ask many questions. He excels at the Science of Things and dreams of becoming a Scholar, but when the Council of Vocations assigns his Life Mandate at fifteen, he is assigned to be a Street Sweeper.

Equality 7-2521 accepts his street sweeping assignment as penance for his Transgression of Preference in secretly desiring to be a Scholar. He works with the handicapped Union 5-3992 and International 4-8818, the latter of whom is Equality 7-2521&#x27;s only friend (which is another Transgression of Preference, because all are supposedly equal in their society). Despite International 4-8818&#x27;s protests that any exploration unauthorized by a Council is forbidden, Equality 7-2521 explores an underground tunnel near the City Theatre tent, and finds metal tracks. Equality 7-2521 believes the tunnel is from the Unmentionable Times of the distant past. He begins sneaking away from his community at night to use the tunnel as a laboratory for scientific experiments, using garbage he has taken from the Home of the Scholars. He is using stolen paper from the Home of the Clerks to write his journal by candlelight, using candles stolen from the larder at the Home of the Street Sweepers.

While cleaning a road at the edge of the city, Equality 7-2521 meets Liberty 5-3000, a 17-year-old Peasant girl who works in the fields. He commits another transgression by thinking constantly of her, instead of waiting to be assigned a woman at the annual Time of Mating, in which men aged twenty and over, and women of eighteen and over, are assigned to each other solely for breeding. She has dark eyes and golden hair, and he names her &quot;The Golden One&quot;. When he speaks to her, he discovers that she also thinks of him. He reveals his secret name for her, and Liberty 5-3000 tells Equality 7-2521 she has named him &quot;The Unconquered&quot;.

Continuing his scientific work, Equality 7-2521 rediscovers electricity. In the ruins of the tunnel, he finds a glass box with wires that gives off light when he passes electricity through it. He decides to take his discovery to the World Council of Scholars; he thinks such a great gift to mankind will outweigh his many transgressions and lead to him being made a Scholar. However, one night, his absence from the Home of the Street Sweepers is noticed. He is whipped and held in the Palace of Corrective Detention. The night before the World Council of Scholars is set to meet, he easily escapes; there are no guards because no one has ever attempted escape before. The next day, he presents his work to the World Council of Scholars. Horrified that he has done unauthorized research, they assail him as a &quot;wretch&quot; and a &quot;gutter cleaner&quot; and say he must be punished. They want to destroy his discovery so it will not disrupt the plans of the World Council and the Department of Candles. Equality 7-2521 seizes the box, cursing the council before fleeing into the Uncharted Forest that lies outside the city.

In the forest, Equality 7-2521 sees himself as damned for having left his fellow men, but he enjoys his freedom. No one will pursue him into this forbidden place. He only misses Liberty 5-3000. On his second day of living in the forest, Liberty 5-3000 appears; she followed him into the forest and vows to stay with him forever. They live together in the forest and try to express their love for one another, but they lack the words to speak of love as individuals.

They find a house from the Unmentionable Times in the mountains and decide to live in it. While reading books from the house&#x27;s library, Equality 7-2521 discovers the word &quot;I&quot; and tells Liberty 5-3000 about it. Her first words to him are, “I love you.” Having rediscovered individuality, they give themselves new names from the books: Equality 7-2521 becomes &quot;Prometheus&quot; and Liberty 5-3000 becomes &quot;Gaea&quot;. Months later, Gaea is pregnant with Prometheus&#x27;s child. Prometheus wonders how men in the past could have given up their individuality; he plans a future in which they will regain it.

==History==

===Development===

Ayn Rand initially conceived &quot;Anthem&quot; as a play when she was a teenager living in Soviet Russia. After migrating to the United States, Rand did not plan to write &quot;Anthem&quot;, but she reconsidered after reading a short story in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; set in the future. Seeing that mainstream magazines would publish speculative fiction, she decided to try submitting &quot;Anthem&quot; to them. She wrote the story in the summer of 1937, while taking a break from research she was doing for her next novel, &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;.

Rand&#x27;s working title was &quot;Ego&quot;. Leonard Peikoff explains the meaning behind this title: &quot;[Rand] is (implicitly) upholding the central principles of her philosophy and of her heroes: reason, values, volition, individualism.&quot; Thinking that the original title was too blunt, unemotional, and would give away too much of the theme, Rand changed the title to &quot;Anthem&quot;. &quot;The present novel, in Miss Rand&#x27;s mind, was from the outset an ode to man&#x27;s ego. It was not difficult, therefore, to change the working title: to move from &#x27;ego&#x27; to &#x27;ode&#x27; or &#x27;anthem&#x27;, leaving the object celebrated by the ode to be discovered by the reader.&quot;

There are similarities between &quot;Anthem&quot; and the 1921 novel &quot;We&quot; by Yevgeny Zamyatin, another author who had lived in Communist Russia. These include:

* A novel taking the form of a secret diary or journal.
* People are identified by codes instead of names.
* Children separated from their parents and brought up by the State.
* Individualism disposed of in favor of collective will.
* A male protagonist who discovers individuality through his relationship with a female character.
*A forest as a &#x27;free&#x27; place outside the &quot;dystopian&quot; city.
* The protagonist discovers a link to the past, when people were free, in a tunnel under the Earth.

There are also a number of differences between the two stories. For example, the society of &quot;We&quot; is in no scientific or technological decay, featuring X-rays, airplanes, microphones, and so on. In contrast, the people of &quot;Anthem&quot; believe that the world is flat and the sun revolves around it, and that bleeding people is a decent form of medicine. The similarities have led to speculation about whether Rand&#x27;s story was directly influenced by Zamyatin&#x27;s. However, there is little evidence that Rand was influenced by or even read Zamyatin&#x27;s work, and she never mentioned it in discussions of her life in Russia.

===Publication history===

Initially, Rand planned on publishing &quot;Anthem&quot; as a magazine story or serial, but her agent encouraged her to publish it as a book. She submitted it simultaneously to Macmillan Publishers in America and Cassell in England. Both had handled her previous novel, &quot;We the Living&quot;. Cassell agreed to publish &quot;Anthem&quot;, but Macmillan declined it. According to Peikoff, &quot;[Macmillan&#x27;s] comment was: the author does not understand socialism.&quot; Another American publisher also turned it down, and Rand&#x27;s agent was unable to sell it as a magazine serial. Cassell published it in England in 1938.

After the success of &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;, a revised edition of &quot;Anthem&quot; was published in the US in 1946 by Pamphleteers, Inc., a small libertarian-oriented publishing house owned by Rand&#x27;s friends Leonard Read and William C. Mullendore. A 50th Anniversary Edition was published in 1995, including an appendix which reproduces the Cassell edition with Rand&#x27;s handwritten editorial changes.

Since its publication in 1946, the revised version of &quot;Anthem&quot; has sold more than 3.5 million copies.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
The original UK edition received mostly positive reviews; several praised Rand&#x27;s imagination and her support of individualism. In &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, reviewer Dilys Powell complimented its &quot;simplicity and sincerity&quot;. Anti-communist journalist Malcolm Muggeridge gave a mixed review in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, saying it had appeal, but its dystopia was not believable. A short review by Maurice Richardson in &quot;The Observer&quot; said it was &quot;highly unconvincing, in spite of some extremely eloquent writing&quot;.

Reviewing the 1953 American first hardcover edition for a genre audience, Anthony Boucher and J. Francis McComas were unsympathetic. Saying that &quot;Rand implies that a sinister conspiracy of purveyors of brotherhood has prevented its American publication until now&quot;, they ironically concluded, &quot;One can only regret that the conspiracy finally broke down.&quot; (Caxton Press offered this first U.S. edition in boards in 1953, while the pulp magazine &quot;Famous Fantastic Mysteries&quot; included reprints of both Franz Kafka&#x27;s &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot; and &quot;Anthem&quot; in the magazine&#x27;s final, June 1953 issue.)

===Awards and nominations===
The Libertarian Futurist Society awarded &quot;Anthem&quot; its Hall of Fame Award in 1987. In 2014, &quot;Anthem&quot; was nominated for a Retrospective Hugo Award for &quot;Best Novella&quot;.

===Adaptations===
Following the release of &quot;Anthem&quot; in the United States, Rand explored opportunities for having it adapted to other media. She had discussions about potential film, opera, and ballet adaptations, but these projects were never realized. In 1946, Rand wrote to Walt Disney that if a screen adaptation were possible, &quot;I would like to see it done in stylized drawings, rather than with living actors.&quot;

In 1950, a radio adaptation was done for &quot;The Freedom Story&quot;, a weekly radio program produced by Spiritual Mobilization, a Christian libertarian group. 
In 2011, it was released as an unabridged audiobook by ABN, the narration by Jason McCoy described as &#x27;stirring and evocative&#x27;.

In 1991, Michael Paxton wrote, directed, and co-produced a stage adaptation of &quot;Anthem&quot;, which appeared at the Lex Theater in Hollywood. The book was adapted into a stage play in 2013 by Jeff Britting, the department manager of the Ayn Rand Archives at the Ayn Rand Institute. First performed in Denver, it opened Off-Broadway in September 2013 at the Jerome Robbins Theater. &quot;The New York Times&quot; review stated, &quot;For a play that celebrates the individual, &quot;Anthem&quot; sure doesn’t trust its audience. Instead of illustrating ideas, this sporadically interesting show too often delivers exposition, desperate to overexplain rather than risk a moment of misunderstanding.&quot; The novella also inspired a spoof rock musical, premiering Off-Broadway at the Lynn Redgrave Theatre in May 2014. The cast included Randy Jones of The Village People, Jason Gotay, Jenna Leigh Green, Remy Zaken, and Ashley Kate Adams. The review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; criticized the acting of the leads, but called the show &quot;exuberant&quot; and better than a straight adaptation.

In 2011, &quot;Anthem&quot; was adapted into a graphic novel by Charles Santino, with artwork by Joe Staton. In 2018, a second graphic novel adaptation was produced, unrelated to the 2011 adaptation, adapted by Jennifer Grossman and Dan Parsons.

===Influence===
The work has inspired many musical pieces, including full-length albums. According to Enzo Stuarti, Pat Boone composed the lyrics and his friend Frank Lovejoy wrote the, quoting Stuarti, &quot;Prelude to this next offering,&quot; of &quot;The Exodus Song&quot;, featured in the album &quot;Stuarti Arrives at Carnegie Hall&quot;. The song begins with a line right out of &quot;Anthem&quot;. In another point of the song it reads: &quot;...I guard my treasures: my thought, my will, my land, and my freedom. And the greatest of these is freedom.&quot; In &quot;Anthem&quot;, it reads: &quot;...I guard my treasures: my thought, my will, my land, my freedom. And the greatest of these is freedom.&quot; A memo to Rand dated May 4, 1964, mentions the unauthorized adaptation, but there is no indication that she took any legal action.

Robert Silverberg&#x27;s 1971 novel &quot;A Time of Changes&quot; also depicts a society where &quot;I&quot; is a forbidden word and where the protagonist rebels against this prohibition. In a 2009 preface to a reprint edition of his novel, Silverberg said he had read &quot;Anthem&quot; in 1953, but had long forgotten it when he wrote &quot;A Time of Changes&quot;. He was surprised to see the similarities when he rediscovered Rand&#x27;s story, but said overall the two books are very different.

&quot;Anthem&quot; is also credited by Neil Peart for influencing Rush&#x27;s &quot;2112&quot; with strong parallels to the plot, structure, and theme of &quot;Anthem&quot;. Peart has said that although he read &quot;Anthem&quot;, he was not consciously thinking of the story when he wrote the song; however when he recognized there were similarities, he gave credit to &quot;the genius of Ayn Rand&quot; in the liner notes. The band also released a song called &quot;Anthem&quot; on their &quot;Fly by Night&quot; album, and their Canadian record label (co-founded by Rush manager Ray Danniels) is Anthem Records.

Among Rand&#x27;s works, &quot;Anthem&quot; is one of the most commonly assigned as secondary school reading. The Ayn Rand Institute provides free copies of the novel for use in schools, and holds an annual &quot;Anthem&quot; essay contest for students.

<text>Equilibrium is a 2002 American science fiction film written and directed by Kurt Wimmer, and starring Christian Bale, Emily Watson, and Taye Diggs. The film follows Bale as John Preston, an enforcement officer in a future in which feelings and artistic expression are outlawed, and a society where its citizens are forced to take psychoactive drugs to suppress emotion. After accidentally missing a dose, Preston awakens and begins to uncover the suspicious inner workings of the regime governing the totalitarian state.

Miramax Films released &quot;Equilibrium&quot; theatrically on December 6, 2002. The film was a critical and commercial failure, receiving unfavorable reviews and grossing only $5.3 million against a production budget of $20 million.

==Plot==

Established by survivors of World War III, the totalitarian city-state of Libria blames human emotion as the root of all conflicts. It strictly outlaws all activities or objects that stimulate emotion, with violators labeled Sense Offenders and sentenced to death. The population has to take a daily injection of the emotion-suppressing drug called Prozium II. Libria is governed by the Tetragrammaton Council, led by &quot;Father&quot;, who communicates propaganda through giant video screens. The police force is led by the Grammaton Clerics, elite fighters trained in the art of gun kata. Clerics frequently raid homes to search for and destroy illegal materials – art, literature and music – executing violators on the spot. A resistance movement, known as the &quot;Underground&quot;, emerges to topple Father and the Tetragrammaton Council.
In 2072, John Preston is a high-ranking Cleric whose wife, Viviana, was executed as a Sense Offender, leaving him as a single parent of two. Following a raid, Preston&#x27;s partner Errol Partridge saves a book of poems by W. B. Yeats instead of turning it in for incineration. He follows Partridge to the Nether – a term for regions outside the city – and finds him reading the book. Seeing Preston, Partridge claims he gladly pays the price of feeling emotion. Preston executes Partridge.

Preston accidentally breaks his last vial of Prozium and is unable to refill them before the next raid. Brief episodes of emotion set in evoking memories, stirring feelings, and making him more aware of his surroundings. He intentionally skips additional doses of Prozium, hiding them behind his bathroom mirror. Partridge is replaced with an ambitious, career-conscious Brandt, who admires Preston&#x27;s work as a Cleric. On a raid, they arrest Sense Offender Mary O&#x27;Brien. Preston prevents Brandt from executing O&#x27;Brien, saying she should be interrogated.

Preston feels remorse for killing Partridge, develops an emotional relationship with O&#x27;Brien, and seeks atonement. He uncovers clues that lead to meeting Jurgen, the Underground leader. Jurgen plans to disrupt Prozium production to spark an uprising and convinces Preston that Father must be assassinated. Vice-Counsel DuPont meets with Preston to reveal that there is a traitor in the upper ranks of the Clerics, and assigns Preston the task of unmasking the traitor. Relieved, Preston accepts and promises to locate the Underground&#x27;s leadership.

When O&#x27;Brien is set to be executed, Preston attempts to stop the execution and fails. His memory of his wife&#x27;s execution triggers an emotional breakdown. Brandt, who has been suspecting Preston of being a Sense Offender, arrests and brings him before DuPont. Preston tricks DuPont into believing that Brandt is the traitor. Preston is told that his home will be searched as a formality. He rushes home to destroy the hidden vials only to discover his son, who stopped taking Prozium after his mother died, already has.

Jurgen tells Preston to capture the resistance leaders to regain Father&#x27;s trust, hoping it will get him close enough to assassinate Father. Preston is granted an exclusive audience with Father only to discover that Brandt was not arrested; it was part of a ruse to capture Preston and the Underground. DuPont reveals he is Father, having secretly replaced the original Father who died, and that his cabal doesn&#x27;t take Prozium to suppress emotion. He taunts Preston, asking how it felt to betray the Underground.

Having anticipated the trap, Preston fights his way through an army of bodyguards to DuPont&#x27;s office, confronting and killing Brandt in a katana battle. DuPont and Preston engage in a gun kata showdown. Preston wins as DuPont pleads for his life asking, &quot;Is it really worth the price?&quot; Paying homage to Partridge&#x27;s last words, he responds, &quot;I pay it gladly&quot; and kills DuPont. He destroys the command center that broadcasts Father propaganda. Preston watches with satisfaction from above as the Underground destroys Prozium manufacturing plants, signaling the beginning of the revolution.

==Cast==

==Gun kata==

Angus Macfadyen&#x27;s character, Vice-Counsel DuPont, describes the fictional fighting style &quot;gun kata&quot; in the film:

Through analysis of thousands of recorded gunfights, the Cleric has determined that the geometric distribution of antagonists in any gun battle is a statistically-predictable element. The gun kata treats the gun as a total weapon, each fluid position representing a maximum kill zone, inflicting maximum damage on the maximum number of opponents, while keeping the defender clear of the statistically-traditional trajectories of return fire. By the rote mastery of this art, your firing efficiency will rise by no less than 120 percent. The difference of a 63 percent increased lethal proficiency makes the master of the gun katas an adversary not to be taken lightly.

Kata (型, かた) is a Japanese word for standard forms of movements and postures in karate, jujutsu, aikido, and many other traditional martial arts. The gun kata shown in &quot;Equilibrium&quot; is a hybrid of Wimmer&#x27;s own style of gun kata (invented in his backyard).

==Production==
Initially announced in 1999 under the title of &quot;Librium&quot;, the film was produced by Jan de Bont&#x27;s production company, Blue Tulip Productions, with most of the budget secured in a Dutch tax incentive deal thanks to de Bont&#x27;s Dutch citizenship. Emily Watson was cast in May 2000, with Christian Bale cast the following month in June of that year.

Filming began on October 19, 2000, and ended on December 10, 2000. Most of the filming used locations in Berlin, due to its unique mixture of fascist and modern architecture. According to the visual effects supervisor Tim McGovern, who worked alongside Wimmer, the fascist architecture was chosen &quot;to make the individual feel small and insignificant so the government seems more powerful&quot;. The modern architecture of Berlin emphasizes the futuristic and stolid appearance of the city-state of Libria. Thick walls are represented by an abandoned East German military base, while the exterior of the city, where many of the surviving rebels reside, was filmed in decrepit neighborhoods of East Germany. In addition to the geographic location, a few European art directors also made substantial contributions to the production.

&quot;Equilibrium&quot; locations include:
* Olympic Stadium (Berlin), built for the 1936 Summer Olympics.
* Deutschlandhalle, also built for the 1936 Summer Olympics.
* Brandenburg Gate in Berlin.
* Berlin Tempelhof Airport, construction of which was begun before the Nazi era, but which was completed during World War II and displays characteristics of the Nazis&#x27; architectural style.
* Bundestag (Berlin U-Bahn) station, a modern subway station near the new Reichstag building along with long tunnels of the Berlin U-Bahn underground railway. At the time the film was made, the Bundestag station was unopened, but in 2009, it went into service.
* Decrepit East German neighborhoods, as well as an abandoned massive former GDR military base.
* The EUR district in Rome, Italy, built during the fascist rule of Benito Mussolini.

Although making a science fiction movie, Wimmer intentionally avoided using futuristic technology that could become obsolete, and he also decided to set his story in an indeterminate future. &quot;I wanted to create more of an alternate reality than get caught up in the gadgetry of science fiction,&quot; he explained. &quot;In fact, there&#x27;s no technology in &quot;Equilibrium&quot; that doesn&#x27;t already exist. It&#x27;s more like a parallel universe, the perfect setting for a parable.&quot;

==Reception==
===Critical response===
The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 40% of 90 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 4.8/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;&quot;Equilibrium&quot; is a reheated mishmash of other sci-fi movies.&quot; Metacritic gave the film a score of 33 out of 100, based on reviews from 22 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Elvis Mitchell of &quot;The New York Times&quot; dismissed &quot;Equilibrium&quot; for having heavily borrowed from &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;, &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, &quot;Brave New World&quot; and other science fiction classics. Roger Ebert awarded the film three stars out of four, noting that: &quot;&quot;Equilibrium&quot; would be a mindless action picture, except that it has a mind. It doesn&#x27;t do a lot of deep thinking, but unlike many futuristic combos of sf and f/x, it does make a statement.&quot;

Wimmer said in a &quot;Dreamwatch&quot; interview that &quot;the paying customers seemed to get it&quot;, and said the critics &quot;didn&#x27;t seem to see that the film had a different message than&quot; &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; or &quot;1984&quot;. Responding to the critics&#x27; views, Wimmer later said, &quot;Why would I make a movie for someone I wouldn&#x27;t want to hang out with? Have you ever met a critic who you wanted to party with? I haven&#x27;t.&quot;

===Box office===
The film had an estimated production budget of $20 million. International pre-release sales had already made a profit, so the studio reduced the film&#x27;s promotion and advertising budget to avoid the risk of the film losing money; as a consequence, theatrical release was limited.

The film was shown in only 301 theaters at its widest release in the United States, earning $541,512 in its opening week, and only $1.2 million when it closed on December 26, 2002; the film earned $4.1 million internationally, for a total of $5.3 million worldwide.

<text>The grammar of the German language is quite similar to that of the other Germanic languages.
Although some features of German grammar, such as the formation of some of the verb forms, resemble those of English, German grammar differs from that of English in that it has, among other things, cases and gender in nouns and a strict verb-second word order in main clauses.

German has retained many of the grammatical distinctions that other Germanic languages have lost in whole or in part. There are three genders and four cases, and verbs are conjugated for person and number. Accordingly, German has more inflections than English, and uses more suffixes. For example, in comparison to the -s added to third-person singular present-tense verbs in English, most German verbs employ four different suffixes for the conjugation of present-tense verbs, namely - for the first-person singular, - for the informal second-person singular, - for the third-person singular and for the informal second-person plural, and - for the first- and third-person plural, as well as for the formal second-person singular/plural.

Owing to the gender and case distinctions, the articles have more possible forms. In addition, some prepositions combine with some of the articles.

Numerals are similar to other Germanic languages. Unlike modern English, Swedish, Norwegian, Icelandic and Faroese, units are placed before tens as in Afrikaans, Early Modern English, Danish, Dutch, Yiddish and Frisian, e.g. twenty-one: one-and-twenty.

==Nouns==
===Gender===
Students of German are often advised to learn German nouns with their accompanying definite article, as the definite article of a German noun corresponds to the gender of the noun. However, the meaning or form, especially the ending, of a noun can be used to recognize 80% of noun genders. For instance, nouns ending in the suffixes , , , or are always feminine.

=== Case ===
==Articles==
==Adjectives==
===Declension of adjectives===
==Pronouns==
==Adverbial phrases==

==Verbs==
===Separable verbs===
==Conjugation==
==Modal particles==
==Sentences structure==
German sentence structure is similar to other Germanic languages in its use of V2 word order.

<text>A national anthem is a patriotic musical composition symbolizing and evoking eulogies of the history and traditions of a country or nation. The majority of national anthems are marches or hymns in style. American, Central Asian, and European nations tend towards more ornate and operatic pieces, while those in the Middle East, Oceania, Africa, and the Caribbean use a more simplistic fanfare. Some countries that are devolved into multiple constituent states have their own official musical compositions for them (such as with the United Kingdom, Russia, and the Soviet Union); their constituencies&#x27; songs are sometimes referred to as national anthems even though they are not sovereign states.

== History ==
In the early modern period, some European monarchies adopted royal anthems. Some of these anthems have survived into current use. &quot;God Save the King/Queen&quot;, first performed in 1619, remains the royal anthem of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth realms . , adopted as the royal anthem of the Spanish monarchy in 1770, was adopted as the national anthem of Spain in 1939. Denmark retains its royal anthem, (1780) alongside its national anthem (, adopted 1835). In 1802, Gia Long commissioned a royal anthem in the European fashion for the Kingdom of Vietnam.

Following the reinstating of La Marseillaise in 1830, in the wake of the July Revolution, as the national anthem of France, it became common for newly formed nations to define national anthems, notably as a result of the Latin American wars of independence, for Argentina (1813), Peru (1821), Brazil (1831) but also Belgium (1830). Consequently, adoption of national anthems prior to the 1930s was mostly by newly formed or newly independent states, such as the First Portuguese Republic (, 1911), the Kingdom of Greece (&quot;Hymn to Liberty&quot;, 1865), the First Philippine Republic (, 1898), Lithuania (, 1919), Weimar Germany (, 1922), Ireland (, 1926) and Greater Lebanon (&quot;Lebanese National Anthem&quot;, 1927). Though the custom of an officially adopted national anthem became popular in the 19th century, some national anthems predate this period, often existing as patriotic songs long before their designation as national anthem.

If an anthem is defined as consisting of both a melody and lyrics, then the oldest national anthem in use today is the national anthem of the Netherlands, the &quot;Wilhelmus&quot;. Written between 1568 and 1572 during the Dutch Revolt, it was already a popular orangist hymn during the 17th century, though it would take until 1932 for it to be officially recognized as the Dutch national anthem. The lyrics of the Japanese national anthem, &quot;Kimigayo&quot;, predate those of the Dutch anthem by several centuries, being taken from a Heian period (794–1185) poem, but were not set to music until 1880. If a national anthem is defined by being officially designated as the national song of a particular state, then , which was officially adopted by the French National Convention in 1796, would qualify as the first official national anthem.
&quot;&quot; was written by Goffredo Mameli and set to music by Michele Novaro in 1847, currently used as the national anthem of Italy. The song was very popular during Italian unification and the following decades. However, after the Kingdom of Italy&#x27;s 1861 proclamation, the republican and Jacobin connotations of &quot;Il Canto degli Italiani&quot; were difficult to reconcile with the new state&#x27;s monarchic constitution. The kingdom chose instead &quot;Marcia Reale&quot; (Royal March), the House of Savoy&#x27;s official anthem, composed by order of King Charles Albert of Sardinia in 1831. After the World War II, Italy became a republic. On 12 October 1946, it chose &quot;Il Canto degli Italiani&quot; as a provisional national anthem. The song would retain this role as &quot;de facto&quot; anthem of the Italian Republic, and after several unsuccessful attempts, gained &quot;de jure&quot; status on 4 December 2017.

The Olympic Charter of 1920 introduced the ritual of playing the national anthems of the gold medal winners. From this time, the playing of national anthems became increasingly popular at international sporting events, creating an incentive for such nations that did not yet have an officially defined national anthem to introduce one.

The United States introduced the patriotic song &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; as a national anthem in 1931. Following this, several nations moved to adopt as official national anthem patriotic songs that had already been in &quot;de facto&quot; use at official functions, such as Mexico (, composed 1854, adopted 1943) and Switzerland (&quot;Swiss Psalm&quot;, composed 1841, &quot;de facto&quot; use from 1961, adopted 1981).

By the period of decolonisation in the 1960s, it had become common practice for newly independent nations to adopt an official national anthem. Some of these anthems were specifically commissioned, such as the anthem of Kenya, , produced by a dedicated &quot;Kenyan Anthem Commission&quot; in 1963.

A number of nations remain without an official national anthem adopted &quot;de jure&quot;. In these cases, there are established &quot;de facto&quot; anthems played at sporting events or diplomatic receptions. These include the United Kingdom (God Save the King) and Sweden (; the country also has a royal anthem, ). Countries that have moved to officially adopt &quot;de iure&quot; their long-standing &quot;de facto&quot; anthems since the 1990s include: Luxembourg (, adopted 1993), South Africa (National anthem of South Africa, adopted 1997) and Israel (, composed 1888, &quot;de facto&quot; use from 1948, adopted 2004).

== Usage ==

National anthems are used in a wide array of contexts. Certain etiquette may be involved in the playing of a country&#x27;s anthem. These usually involve military honours, standing up, removing headwear etc. In diplomatic situations the rules may be very formal. There may also be royal anthems, presidential anthems, state anthems etc. for special occasions.

They are played on national holidays and festivals, and have also come to be closely connected with sporting events. Wales was the first country to adopt this, during a rugby game against New Zealand in 1905. Since then during sporting competitions, such as the Olympic Games, the national anthem of the gold medal winner is played at each medal ceremony; also played before games in many sports leagues, since being adopted in baseball during World War II. When teams from two nations play each other, the anthems of both nations are played, the host nation&#x27;s anthem being played last.

In some countries, the national anthem is played to students each day at the start and/or end of school as an exercise in patriotism, such as in Tanzania. In other countries the state anthem may be played in a theatre before a play or in a cinema before a movie. Many radio and television stations have adopted this and play the national anthem when they sign on in the morning and again when they sign off at night. For instance, the national anthem of China is played before the broadcast of evening news on Hong Kong&#x27;s local television stations including TVB Jade. In Colombia, it is a law to play the National Anthem at 6:00 and 18:00 on every public radio and television station, while in Thailand, &quot;Phleng Chat Thai&quot; is played at 08:00 and 18:00 nationwide (the Royal Anthem is used for sign-ons and closedowns instead).
The use of a national anthem outside of its country, however, is dependent on the international recognition of that country. For instance, Taiwan has not been recognized by the International Olympic Committee as a separate nation since 1979 and must compete as Chinese Taipei; its &quot;National Banner Song&quot; is used instead of its national anthem. In Taiwan, the country&#x27;s national anthem is sung before instead of during flag-rising and flag-lowering, followed by the National Banner Song during the actual flag-rising and flag-lowering. Even within a state, the state&#x27;s citizenry may interpret the national anthem differently (such as in the United States some view the U.S. national anthem as representing respect for dead soldiers and policemen whereas others view it as honouring the country generally).

Various solutions may be used when countries with different national anthems compete in a unified team. When North Korea and South Korea participated together in the 2018 Winter Olympics, the folk song &quot;Arirang&quot;, beloved on both sides of the border and seen as a symbol of Korea as a whole, was used as an anthem instead of the national anthem of either state.

== Creators ==

Most of the best-known national anthems were written by little-known or unknown composers such as Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle, composer of &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; and John Stafford Smith who wrote the tune for &quot;The Anacreontic Song&quot;, which became the tune for the U.S. national anthem, &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;. The author of &quot;God Save the King&quot;, one of the oldest and best-known anthems in the world, is unknown and disputed.

Very few countries have a national anthem written by a world-renowned composer. Exceptions include Germany, whose anthem &quot;Das Lied der Deutschen&quot; uses a melody written by Joseph Haydn, and Austria, whose national anthem &quot;Land der Berge, Land am Strome&quot; is sometimes credited to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The music of the &quot;Pontifical Anthem&quot;, anthem of the Vatican City, was composed in 1869 by Charles Gounod, for the golden jubilee of Pope Pius IX&#x27;s priestly ordination. When Armenia was under Soviet rule, its anthem, the &quot;Anthem of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic&quot; used a melody by Aram Khachaturian.

The committee charged with choosing a national anthem for the Federation of Malaya (later Malaysia) at independence decided to invite selected composers of international repute to submit compositions for consideration, including Benjamin Britten, William Walton, Gian Carlo Menotti and Zubir Said, who later composed &quot;Majulah Singapura&quot;, the national anthem of Singapore. None were deemed suitable. The tune eventually selected was (and still is) the anthem of the constituent state of Perak, which was in turn adopted from a popular French melody titled &quot;La Rosalie&quot; composed by the lyricist Pierre-Jean de Béranger.

A few anthems have words by Nobel laureates in literature. The first Asian laureate, Rabindranath Tagore, wrote the words and music of &quot;Jana Gana Mana&quot; and &quot;Amar Shonar Bangla&quot;, later adopted as the national anthems of India and Bangladesh respectively. Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson wrote the lyrics for the Norwegian national anthem &quot;Ja, vi elsker dette landet&quot;.

Other countries had their anthems composed by locally important people. This is the case for Colombia, whose anthem&#x27;s lyrics were written by former president and poet Rafael Nuñez, who also wrote the country&#x27;s first constitution, and in Malta, written by Dun Karm Psaila, already a National Poet. A similar case is Liberia, the national anthem of which was written by its third president, Daniel Bashiel Warner.

== Languages ==
A national anthem, when it has lyrics (as is usually the case), is most often in the national or most common language of the country, whether &quot;de facto&quot; or official, though there are notable exceptions. Most commonly, states with more than one national language may offer several versions of their anthem, for instance:
* The &quot;Swiss Psalm&quot;, the national anthem of Switzerland, has different lyrics for each of the country&#x27;s four official languages (French, German, Italian and Romansh).
* The national anthem of Canada, &quot;O Canada&quot;, has official lyrics in both English and French which are not translations of each other, and is frequently sung with a mixture of stanzas, representing the country&#x27;s bilingual nature. The song itself was originally written in French.
* &quot;Flower of Scotland&quot;, the unofficial national anthem of Scotland, features some words written and spoken in the Scots language
* &quot;The Soldier&#x27;s Song&quot;, the national anthem of Ireland, was originally written and adopted in English, but an Irish translation, although never formally adopted, is nowadays almost always sung instead, even though only 10.5% of Ireland speaks Irish natively.
* The current South African national anthem is unique in that five of the country&#x27;s eleven official languages are used in the same anthem (the first stanza is divided between two languages, with each of the remaining three stanzas in a different language). It was created by combining two songs together and then modifying the lyrics and adding new ones.
* The former country of Czechoslovakia combined the two national anthems of the two lands; the first stanza consisting of the first stanza of the Czech anthem &quot;Kde domov můj&quot;, and the second stanza consisting of the first stanza of the Slovak anthem &quot;Nad Tatrou sa blýska&quot;.
* One of the two official national anthems of New Zealand, &quot;God Defend New Zealand&quot;, is now commonly sung with the first verse in Māori (&quot;Aotearoa&quot;) and the second in English (&quot;God Defend New Zealand&quot;). The tune is the same but the words are not a direct translation of each other.
* &quot;God Bless Fiji&quot; has lyrics in English and Fijian which are not translations of each other. Although official, the Fijian version is rarely sung, and it is usually the English version that is performed at international sporting events.
* Although Singapore has four official languages, with English being the current &quot;lingua franca&quot;, the national anthem, &quot;Majulah Singapura&quot; is in Malay and, by law, can only be sung with its original Malay lyrics, despite Malay being a minority language in Singapore. This is because Part XIII of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore declares, &quot;the national language shall be the Malay language and shall be in the Roman script [...]&quot;
* There are several countries that do not have official lyrics to their national anthems. One of these is the &quot;Marcha Real&quot;, the national anthem of Spain. Although it originally had lyrics, those lyrics were discontinued after governmental changes in the early 1980s after Francisco Franco&#x27;s dictatorship ended. In 2007, a national competition to write words was held, but no lyrics were chosen. Other national anthems with no words include &quot;Inno Nazionale della Repubblica&quot;, the national anthem of San Marino, that of Bosnia and Herzegovina, that of Russia from 1990 to 2000, and that of Kosovo, entitled &quot;Europe&quot;.
* The national anthem of India, &quot;Jana Gana Mana&quot;: the official lyrics are in Bengali; they were adapted from a poem written by Rabindranath Tagore.
* Despite the most common language in Wales being English, the unofficial national anthem of Wales, &quot;Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau&quot; is sung in the Welsh language.
* An unofficial national anthem of Finland, &quot;Maamme&quot;, was first written in Swedish and only later translated to Finnish. It is nowadays sung in both languages as there is a Swedish speaking minority of about 5% in the country. The national anthem of Estonia, &quot;Mu isamaa, mu õnn ja rõõm&quot; has a similar melody with &quot;Maamme&quot;, but only with different lyrics and without repeating the second halves of strophes. &quot;Finlandia&quot; has been repeatedly suggested to be the official national anthem of Finland.
* The national anthem of Pakistan, the &quot;Qaumi Taranah&quot;, is unique in that it is entirely in Farsi (Persian) with the exception of one word which is in Urdu, the national language.

<doc id="234542" wikidata="Q217157" url="?curid=234542" title="Richard Trevithick">
<text>Richard Trevithick (13 April 1771 – 22 April 1833) was a British inventor and mining engineer. The son of a mining captain, and born in the mining heartland of Cornwall, Trevithick was immersed in mining and engineering from an early age. He was an early pioneer of steam-powered road and rail transport, and his most significant contributions were the development of the first high-pressure steam engine and the first working railway steam locomotive. The world&#x27;s first locomotive-hauled railway journey took place on 21 February 1804, when Trevithick&#x27;s unnamed steam locomotive hauled a train along the tramway of the Penydarren Ironworks, in Merthyr Tydfil, Wales.

Turning his interests abroad Trevithick also worked as a mining consultant in Peru and later explored parts of Costa Rica. Throughout his professional career he went through many ups and downs and at one point faced financial ruin, also suffering from the strong rivalry of many mining and steam engineers of the day. During the prime of his career he was a well-known and highly respected figure in mining and engineering, but near the end of his life he fell out of the public eye.

Trevithick was extremely strong and was a champion Cornish wrestler.

==Childhood and early life==
Richard Trevithick was born at Tregajorran (in the parish of Illogan), between Camborne and Redruth, in the heart of one of the rich mineral-mining areas of Cornwall. He was the youngest-but-one child and the only boy in a family of six children. He was very tall for the era at , as well as athletic and concentrated more on sport than schoolwork. Sent to the village school at Camborne, he did not take much advantage of the education provided; one of his school masters described him as &quot;a disobedient, slow, obstinate, spoiled boy, frequently absent and very inattentive&quot;. An exception was arithmetic, for which he had an aptitude, though arriving at the correct answers by unconventional means.

Trevithick was the son of mine &quot;captain&quot; Richard Trevithick (1735–1797) and of miner&#x27;s daughter Ann Teague (died 1810). As a child he would watch steam engines pump water from the deep tin and copper mines in Cornwall. For a time he was a neighbour of William Murdoch, the steam carriage pioneer, and would have been influenced by Murdoch’s experiments with steam-powered road locomotion.

Trevithick first went to work at the age of 19 at the East Stray Park Mine. He was enthusiastic and quickly gained the status of a consultant, unusual for such a young person. He was popular with the miners because of the respect they had for his father.

===Marriage and family===
In 1797 Trevithick married Jane Harvey of Hayle. They raised 6 children:
* Richard Trevithick (1798–1872)
* Anne Ellis (1800–1877)
* Elizabeth Banfield (1803–1870)
* John Harvey Trevithick (1807–1877)
* Francis Trevithick (1812–1877)
* Frederick Henry Trevithick (1816–1883)

==Career==

Jane&#x27;s father, John Harvey, formerly a blacksmith from Carnhell Green, formed the local foundry, Harveys of Hayle. His company became famous worldwide for building huge stationary &quot;beam&quot; engines for pumping water, usually from mines. Up to this time such steam engines were of the condensing or atmospheric type, originally invented by Thomas Newcomen in 1712, which also became known as low-pressure engines. James Watt, on behalf of his partnership with Matthew Boulton, held a number of patents for improving the efficiency of Newcomen&#x27;s engine—including the &quot;separate condenser patent&quot;, which proved the most contentious.

Trevithick became engineer at the Ding Dong Mine in 1797, and there (in conjunction with Edward Bull) he pioneered the use of high-pressure steam. He worked on building and modifying steam engines to avoid the royalties due to Watt on the separate condenser patent. Boulton &amp; Watt served an injunction on him at Ding Dong, and posted it &quot;on the minestuffs&quot; and &quot;most likely on the door&quot; of the Count (Account) House which, although now a ruin, is the only surviving building from Trevithick&#x27;s time there.

He also experimented with the plunger-pole pump, a type of pump—with a beam engine—used widely in Cornwall&#x27;s tin mines, in which he reversed the plunger to change it into a water-power engine.

==High-pressure engine==
As his experience grew, he realised that improvements in boiler technology now permitted the safe production of high-pressure steam, which could move a piston in a steam engine on its own account, instead of using pressure near to atmospheric, in a condensing engine.

He was not the first to think of so-called &quot;strong steam&quot; or steam of about . William Murdoch had developed and demonstrated a model steam carriage, initially in 1784, and demonstrated it to Trevithick at his request in 1794. In fact, Trevithick lived next door to Murdoch in Redruth in 1797 and 1798. Oliver Evans in the U.S. had also concerned himself with the concept, but there is no indication that his ideas had ever come to Trevithick&#x27;s attention.

Independently of this, Arthur Woolf was experimenting with higher pressures whilst working as the Chief Engineer of the Griffin Brewery (proprietors Meux and Reid). This was an Engine designed by Hornblower and Maberly, and the proprietors were keen to have the best steam engine in London. Around 1796, Woolf believed he could save substantial amounts of coal consumption.

According to his son Francis, Trevithick was the first to make high-pressure steam work in England in 1799, although other sources say he had invented his first high-pressure engine by 1797. Not only would a high-pressure steam engine eliminate the condenser, but it would allow the use of a smaller cylinder, saving space and weight. He reasoned that his engine could now be more compact, lighter, and small enough to carry its own weight even with a carriage attached. (Note this did not use the &quot;expansion&quot; of the steam, so-called &quot;expansive working&quot; came later)

===Early experiments===
Trevithick began building his first models of high-pressure (meaning a few atmospheres) steam engines – first a stationary one and subsequently one attached to a road carriage. A double-acting cylinder was used, with steam distribution by means of a four-way valve. Exhaust steam was vented via a vertical pipe or chimney straight into the atmosphere, thus avoiding a condenser and any possible infringements of Watt&#x27;s patent. The linear motion was directly converted into circular motion via a crank instead of using a more cumbersome beam.

===&quot;Puffing Devil&quot;===

Trevithick built a full-size steam road locomotive in 1801, on a site near present-day Fore Street in Camborne. (A steam wagon built in 1770 by Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot may have an earlier claim.) Trevithick named his carriage &quot;Puffing Devil&quot; and on Christmas Eve that year, he demonstrated it by successfully carrying six passengers up Fore Street and then continuing on up Camborne Hill, from Camborne Cross, to the nearby village of Beacon. His cousin and associate, Andrew Vivian, steered the machine. It inspired the popular Cornish folk song &quot;Camborne Hill&quot;.

During further tests, Trevithick&#x27;s locomotive broke down three days later after passing over a gully in the road. The vehicle was left under some shelter with the fire still burning whilst the operators retired to a nearby public house for a meal of roast goose and drinks. Meanwhile, the water boiled off, the engine overheated and the machine burned, destroying it. Trevithick did not consider this a serious setback, but rather operator error.

In 1802 Trevithick took out a patent for his high-pressure steam engine. To prove his ideas, he built a stationary engine at the Coalbrookdale Company&#x27;s works in Shropshire in 1802, forcing water to a measured height to measure the work done. The engine ran at forty piston strokes a minute, with an unprecedented boiler pressure of .

===Coalbrookdale Locomotive===
In 1802 the Coalbrookdale Company in Shropshire built a rail locomotive for him, but little is known about it, including whether or not it actually ran. The death of a company workman in an accident involving the engine is said to have caused the company to not proceed to running it on their existing railway. To date, the only known information about it comes from a drawing preserved at the Science Museum, London, together with a letter written by Trevithick to his friend Davies Giddy. The design incorporated a single horizontal cylinder enclosed in a return-flue boiler. A flywheel drove the wheels on one side through spur gears, and the axles were mounted directly on the boiler, with no frame. On the drawing, the piston-rod, guide-bars and cross-head are located directly above the firebox door, thus making the engine extremely dangerous to fire while moving. Furthermore, the first drawing by Daniel Shute indicates that the locomotive ran on a plateway with a track gauge of .

This is the drawing used as the basis of all images and replicas of the later &quot;Pen-y-darren&quot; locomotive, as no plans for that locomotive have survived.

===London Steam Carriage===
The &quot;Puffing Devil&quot; was unable to maintain sufficient steam pressure for long periods, and would have been of little practical use. He built another steam-powered road vehicle in 1803, called the London Steam Carriage, which attracted much attention from the public and press when he drove it that year in London from Holborn to Paddington and back. It was uncomfortable for passengers and proved more expensive to run than a horse-drawn carriage, and was abandoned.

In 1831, Trevithick gave evidence to a Parliamentary select committee on steam carriages.

===Tragedy at Greenwich===
Also in 1803, one of Trevithick&#x27;s stationary pumping engines in use at Greenwich exploded, killing four men. Although Trevithick considered the explosion to be caused by a case of careless operation rather than design error, the incident was exploited relentlessly by James Watt and Matthew Boulton (competitors and promoters of the low-pressure engine) who highlighted the perceived risks of using high-pressure steam.

Trevithick&#x27;s response was to incorporate two safety valves into future designs, only one of which could be adjusted by the operator. The adjustable valve comprised a disc covering a small hole at the top of the boiler above the water level in the steam chest. The force exerted by the steam pressure was equalised by an opposite force created by a weight attached to a pivoted lever. The position of the weight on the lever was adjustable thus allowing the operator to set the maximum steam pressure. Trevithick also added a fusible plug of lead, positioned in the boiler just below the minimum safe water level. Under normal operation the water temperature could not exceed that of boiling water and kept the lead below its melting point. If the water ran low, it exposed the lead plug, and the cooling effect of the water was lost. The temperature would then rise sufficiently to melt the lead, releasing steam into the fire, reducing the boiler pressure and providing an audible alarm in sufficient time for the operator to damp the fire, and let the boiler cool before damage could occur. He also introduced the hydraulic testing of boilers, and the use of a mercury manometer to indicate the pressure.

===&quot;Pen-y-Darren&quot; locomotive===
In 1802 Trevithick built one of his high-pressure steam engines to drive a hammer at the Penydarren Ironworks in Merthyr Tydfil, Mid Glamorgan. With the assistance of Rees Jones, an employee of the iron works, and under the supervision of Samuel Homfray, the proprietor, Trevithick mounted the engine on wheels and turned it into a locomotive. In 1803, Trevithick sold the patents for his locomotives to Samuel Homfray.

Homfray was so impressed with Trevithick&#x27;s locomotive that he made a bet of 500 guineas with another ironmaster, Richard Crawshay, that Trevithick&#x27;s steam locomotive could haul ten tons of iron along the Merthyr Tramroad from Penydarren () to Abercynon (), a distance of . On 21 February 1804, amid great interest from the public, it successfully carried 10 tons of iron, five wagons and 70 men the full distance in 4 hours and 5 minutes, at an average speed of approximately . As well as Homfray, Crawshay and the passengers, other witnesses included Mr. Giddy, a respected patron of Trevithick, and an &quot;engineer from the Government&quot;. The engineer from the government was probably a safety inspector, who would have been particularly interested in the boiler&#x27;s ability to withstand high steam pressures.

The configuration of the Pen-y-Darren engine differed from the Coalbrookdale engine. The cylinder was moved to the other end of the boiler so that the fire door was out of the way of the moving parts. That obviously also involved putting the crankshaft at the chimney end. The locomotive comprised a boiler with a single return flue mounted on a four-wheel frame. At one end, a single cylinder, with very long stroke, was mounted partly in the boiler, and a piston rod crosshead ran out along a slidebar, an arrangement that looked like a giant trombone. There was only one cylinder, which was coupled to a large flywheel mounted on one side. The rotational inertia of the flywheel would even out the movement that was transmitted to a central cog-wheel that was, in turn connected to the driving wheels. It used a high-pressure cylinder without a condenser. The exhaust steam was sent up the chimney, which assisted the draught through the fire, increasing the efficiency of the engine even more.

The bet was won. Despite many people&#x27;s doubts, it had been shown that, provided that the gradient was sufficiently gentle, it was possible to successfully haul heavy carriages along a smooth iron road using the adhesive weight alone of a suitably heavy and powerful steam locomotive. Trevithick&#x27;s was probably the first to do so; but some of the short cast iron plates of the tramroad broke under the locomotive, because they were intended only to support the lighter axle load of horse-drawn wagons. Consequently, the tramroad returned to horse power after the initial test run.

Homfray was pleased he won his bet. The engine was placed on blocks and reverted to its original stationary job of driving hammers.

In modern-day Merthyr Tydfil, behind the monument to Trevithick&#x27;s locomotive, lies a stone wall, the sole remainder of the former boundary wall of Homfray&#x27;s Penydarren House.

A full-scale working reconstruction of the Pen-y-darren locomotive was commissioned in 1981 and delivered to the Welsh Industrial and Maritime Museum in Cardiff. When that closed, the locomotive was moved to the National Waterfront Museum in Swansea. Several times a year, it is run on a length of railway outside the museum.

===&quot;Newcastle&quot; locomotive===
Christopher Blackett, proprietor of the Wylam colliery near Newcastle, heard of the success in Wales and wrote to Trevithick asking for locomotive designs. These were sent to John Whitfield at Gateshead, Trevithick&#x27;s agent, who in 1804 built what was probably the first locomotive to have flanged wheels. Blackett was using wooden rails for his tramway and, once again, Trevithick&#x27;s machine was to prove too heavy for its track.

===&quot;Catch Me Who Can&quot;===
In 1808 Trevithick publicised his steam railway locomotive expertise by building a new locomotive called &quot;Catch Me Who Can&quot;, built for him by John Hazledine and John Urpeth Rastrick at Bridgnorth in Shropshire, and named by Davies Giddy&#x27;s daughter. The configuration differed from the previous locomotives in that the cylinder was mounted vertically and drove a pair of wheels directly without a flywheel or gearing. This was probably Trevithick&#x27;s fourth locomotive, after those used at Coalbrookdale, Pen-y-darren ironworks, and the Wylam colliery. He ran it on a circular track just south of the present-day Euston Square tube station in London. The site in Bloomsbury has recently been identified archaeologically as that occupied by the Chadwick Building, part of University College London.

Admission to the &quot;steam circus&quot; was one shilling including a ride and it was intended to show that rail travel was faster than by horse. This venture also suffered from weak tracks and public interest was limited.

Trevithick was disappointed by the response and designed no more railway locomotives. It was not until 1812 that twin-cylinder steam locomotives, built by Matthew Murray in Holbeck, Leeds successfully started replacing horses for hauling coal wagons on the edge railed, rack and pinion Middleton Railway from Middleton colliery to Leeds, West Yorkshire.

==Engineering projects==

===Thames tunnel===
Robert Vazie, another Cornish engineer, was selected by the Thames Archway Company in 1805 to drive a tunnel under the River Thames at Rotherhithe. Vazie encountered serious problems with water influx, and had got no further than sinking the end shafts when the directors called in Trevithick for consultation. The directors agreed to pay Trevithick £1000 (the equivalent of £ in ) if he could successfully complete the tunnel, a length of . In August 1807, he began driving a small pilot tunnel or driftway high tapering from at the top to at the bottom. By 23 December, after it had progressed , progress was delayed after a sudden inrush of water; and only one month later on 26 January 1808, at , a more serious inrush occurred. The tunnel was flooded; Trevithick, being the last to leave, was nearly drowned. Clay was dumped on the river bed to seal the hole, and the tunnel was drained, but mining was now more difficult. Progress stalled, and a few of the directors attempted to discredit Trevithick, but the quality of his work was eventually upheld by two colliery engineers from the North of England. Despite suggesting various building techniques to complete the project, including a submerged cast iron tube, Trevithick&#x27;s links with the company ceased and the project was never actually completed.

====Completion====
The first successful tunnel under the Thames was started by Sir Marc Isambard Brunel in 1823, upstream, assisted by his son Isambard Kingdom Brunel (who also nearly died in a tunnel collapse). Marc Brunel finally completed it in 1843, the delays being due to problems with funding.

Trevithick&#x27;s suggestion of a submerged tube approach was successfully implemented for the first time across the Detroit River between Michigan in the United States and Ontario in Canada with the construction of the Michigan Central Railway Tunnel, under the engineering supervision of The New York Central Railway&#x27;s engineering vice president, William J Wilgus. Construction began in 1903 and was completed in 1910. The Detroit–Windsor Tunnel which was completed in 1930 for automotive traffic, and the tunnel under the Hong Kong Harbour were also submerged-tube designs.

===Return to London===
Trevithick went on to research other projects to exploit his high-pressure steam engines: boring brass for cannon manufacture, stone crushing, rolling mills, forge hammers, blast furnace blowers as well as the traditional mining applications. He also built a barge powered by paddle wheels and several dredgers.

Trevithick saw opportunities in London and persuaded his wife and four children reluctantly to join him in 1808 for two and a half years lodging first in Rotherhithe and then in Limehouse.

===Nautical projects===
In 1808 Trevithick entered a partnership with Robert Dickinson (businessman), a West India merchant. Dickinson supported several of Trevithick&#x27;s patents. The first of these was the &quot;Nautical Labourer&quot;; a steam tug with a floating crane propelled by paddle wheels. However, it did not meet the fire regulations for the docks, and the Society of Coal Whippers, worried about losing their livelihood, even threatened the life of Trevithick.

Another patent was for the installation of iron tanks in ships for storage of cargo and water instead of in wooden casks. A small works was set up at Limehouse to manufacture them, employing three men. The tanks were also used to raise sunken wrecks by placing them under the wreck and creating buoyancy by pumping them full of air. In 1810 a wreck near Margate was raised in this way but there was a dispute over payment and Trevithick was driven to cut the lashings loose and let it sink again.

In 1809, Trevithick worked on various ideas on improvements for ships: iron floating docks, iron ships, telescopic iron masts, improved ship structures, iron buoys and using heat from the ships boilers for cooking.

===Illness, financial difficulties and return to Cornwall===
In May 1810 Trevithick caught typhoid and nearly died. By September, he had recovered sufficiently to travel back to Cornwall by ship, and in February 1811 he and Dickinson were declared bankrupt. They were not discharged until 1814, Trevithick having paid off most of the partnership debts from his own funds.

===Cornish boiler and engine===
In about 1812 Trevithick designed the ‘Cornish boiler’. These were horizontal, cylindrical boilers with a single internal fire tube or flue passing horizontally through the middle. Hot exhaust gases from the fire passed through the flue thus increasing the surface area heating the water and improving efficiency. These types were installed in the Boulton and Watt pumping engines at Dolcoath and more than doubled their efficiency.

Again in 1812, he installed a new &#x27;high-pressure&#x27; experimental condensing steam engine at Wheal Prosper. This became known as the Cornish engine, and was the most efficient in the world at that time. Other Cornish engineers contributed to its development but Trevithick&#x27;s work was predominant. In the same year he installed another high-pressure engine, though non-condensing, in a threshing machine at the Trewithen Estate, a farm in Probus, Cornwall. It was very successful and proved to be cheaper to run than the horses it replaced. In use for 70 years, it was then retired to an exhibit at the Science Museum. In 2023, the owners of the Trewithen Estate planned to redevelop their farm, which will also involve returning the historic Trevithick steam engine to its original location within the farm.

===Recoil engine===
In one of Trevithick&#x27;s more unusual projects, he attempted to build a &#x27;recoil engine&#x27; similar to the aeolipile described by Hero of Alexandria in about AD 50. Trevithick&#x27;s engine comprised a boiler feeding a hollow axle to route the steam to a catherine wheel with two fine-bore steam jets on its circumference. The first wheel was in diameter and a later attempt was in diameter. To get any usable torque, steam had to issue from the nozzles at a very high velocity and in such large volume that it proved not to operate with adequate efficiency. Today this would be recognised as a reaction turbine.

==South America==

===Draining the Peruvian silver mines===
In 1811 draining water from the rich silver mines of Cerro de Pasco in Peru at an altitude of posed serious problems for the man in charge, Francisco Uville. The low-pressure condensing engines by Boulton and Watt developed so little power as to be useless at this altitude, and they could not be dismantled into sufficiently small pieces to be transported there along mule tracks. Uville was sent to England to investigate using Trevithick&#x27;s high-pressure steam engine. He bought one for 20 guineas, transported it back and found it to work quite satisfactorily. In 1813 Uville set sail again for England and, having fallen ill on the way, broke his journey via Jamaica. When he had recovered he boarded the Falmouth packet ship &#x27;Fox&#x27; coincidentally with one of Trevithick&#x27;s cousins on board the same vessel. Trevithick&#x27;s home was just a few miles from Falmouth so Uville was able to meet him and tell him about the project.

===Trevithick leaves for South America===
On 20 October 1816 Trevithick left Penzance on the whaler ship &quot;Asp&quot; accompanied by a lawyer named Page and a boilermaker bound for Peru. He was received by Uville with honour initially but relations soon broke down and Trevithick left in disgust at the accusations directed at him. He travelled widely in Peru acting as a consultant on mining methods. The government granted him certain mining rights and he found mining areas, but did not have the funds to develop them, with the exception of a copper and silver mine at Caxatambo. After a time serving in the army of Simon Bolivar he returned to Caxatambo but due to the unsettled state of the country and presence of the Spanish army he was forced to leave the area and abandon £5,000 worth of ore ready to ship. Uville died in 1818 and Trevithick soon returned to Cerro de Pasco to continue mining. However, the war of liberation denied him several objectives. Meanwhile, back in England, he was accused of neglecting his wife Jane and family in Cornwall.

===Exploring the isthmus of Costa Rica on foot===
After leaving Cerro de Pasco, Trevithick passed through Ecuador on his way to Bogotá in Colombia. He arrived in Costa Rica in 1822 hoping to develop mining machinery. He spent time looking for a practical route to transport ore and equipment, settling on using the San Juan River, the Sarapiqui River, and then a railway to cover the remaining distance. In a biography his son wrote that Trevithick had in mind a steam-driven railway and not mule-driven.

The initial party comprised Trevithick, Scottish mining projector James Gerard, two schoolboys: José Maria Montealegre (a future president of Costa Rica) and his brother Mariano, whom Gerard intended to enrol at a small boarding school at Lauderdale House in Highgate (where Trevithick later made his temporary London home), and seven natives, three of whom returned home after guiding them through the first part of their journey. The journey was treacherous – one of the party was drowned in a raging torrent and Trevithick was nearly killed on at least two occasions. In the first he was saved from drowning by Gerard, and in the second he was nearly devoured by an alligator following a dispute with a local man whom he had in some way offended. Still in the company of Gerard, he made his way to Cartagena where he chanced to meet Robert Stephenson who was himself on his way home from Colombia, following a failed three-year mining venture. It had been many years since they last met (when Stephenson was just a baby), and the two men were judged by witnesses to their meeting to have little in common. Despite this Stephenson gave Trevithick £50 to help his passage home. Whilst Stephenson and Gerard booked passage via New York, Trevithick took ship direct to Falmouth, arriving there in October 1827 with few possessions other than the clothes he was wearing. He never returned to Costa Rica.

==Later projects==
Taking encouragement from earlier inventors who had achieved some successes with similar endeavours, Trevithick petitioned Parliament for a grant, but he was unsuccessful in acquiring one.

In 1829 he built a closed cycle steam engine followed by a vertical tubular boiler.

In 1830 he invented an early form of storage room heater. It comprised a small fire tube boiler with a detachable flue which could be heated either outside or indoors with the flue connected to a chimney. Once hot the hot water container could be wheeled to where heat was required and the issuing heat could be altered using adjustable doors.

To commemorate the passing of the Reform Bill in 1832 he designed a massive column to be high, being in diameter at the base tapering to at the top where a statue of a horse would have been mounted. It was to be made of 1500 10-foot-square (3 m) pieces of cast iron and would have weighed . There was substantial public interest in the proposal, but it was never built.

===Final project===
About the same time he was invited to do some development work on an engine of a new vessel at Dartford by John Hall, the founder of J &amp; E Hall Limited. The work involved a reaction turbine for which Trevithick earned £1200. He lodged at The Bull hotel in the High Street, Dartford, Kent.

==Death==
After he had been working in Dartford for about a year, Trevithick was taken ill with pneumonia and had to retire to bed at the Bull Hotel, where he was lodging at the time. Following a week&#x27;s confinement in bed he died on the morning of 22 April 1833. He was penniless, and no relatives or friends had attended his bedside during his illness. His colleagues at Hall&#x27;s works made a collection for his funeral expenses and acted as bearers. They also paid a night watchman to guard his grave at night to deter grave robbers, as body snatching was common at that time.

Trevithick was buried in an unmarked grave in St Edmund&#x27;s Burial Ground, East Hill, Dartford. The burial ground closed in 1857, with the gravestones being removed in 1956–57. A plaque marks the approximate spot believed to be the site of the grave. The plaque lies on the side of the park, near the East Hill gate, and an unlinked path.

===Memorials===
In Camborne, outside the public library, a statue by Leonard Stanford Merrifield depicting Trevithick holding one of his small-scale models was unveiled in 1932 by Prince George, Duke of Kent, in front of a crowd of thousands of local people.

On 17 March 2007, Dartford Borough Council invited the Chairman of the Trevithick Society, Phil Hosken, to unveil a Blue plaque at the Royal Victoria and Bull hotel (formerly The Bull) marking Trevithick&#x27;s last years in Dartford and the place of his death in 1833. The Blue Plaque is prominently displayed on the hotel&#x27;s front facade. There is also a plaque at Holy Trinity Church, Dartford.
The Cardiff University Engineering, Computer Science and Physics departments are based around the Trevithick Building which also holds the Trevithick Library, named after Richard Trevithick.

In Gower Street in London, on the wall of the University College building, an elaborate wall plaque carries the legend: &quot;Close to this place Richard Trevithick (Born 1771 – Died 1833) Pioneer of High Pressure Steam ran in the year 1808 the first steam locomotive to draw passengers.&quot; It was erected by &quot;The Trevithick Centenary Memorial Committee&quot;.

One of the oldest depictions of Saint Piran&#x27;s Flag can be seen in a stained glass window at Westminster Abbey, 1888, commemorating Richard Trevithick. The window depicts St Michael at the top and nine Cornish saints, Piran, Petroc, Pinnock, Germanus, Julian, Cyriacus, Constantine, Nonna and Geraint in tiers below. The head of St Piran appears to be a portrait of Trevithick himself and the figure carries the banner of Cornwall.

There is a plaque and memorial situated in Abercynon, outside the fire station. It says &quot;In commemoration of the achievements of Richard Trevithick who having constructed the first steam locomotive did on February 21st 1804 successfully hail 10 tons of iron and numerous passengers along a tramroad from Merthyr to this precinct where was situated the loading point of the Glamorgan Canal&quot;. There is also a building in Abercynon called Ty Trevithick (Trevithick House), named in his honour.

On Penydarren Road, Merthyr Tydfil there is a memorial on the site of the Penydarren Tramway. The inscription reads &quot;RICHARD TREVITHICK 1771-1833 PIONEER OF HIGH PRESSURE STEAM BUILT THE FIRST STEAM LOCOMOTIVE TO RUN ON RAILS. ON FEBRUARY 21ST 1804 IT TRAVERSED THE SPOT ON WHICH THIS MONUMENT STANDS ON ITS WAY TO ABERCYNON&quot;. A short walk north of that is the (slightly misspelled) Trevethick Street, named after Trevithick.

A replica of Trevithick&#x27;s first full-size steam road locomotive was first displayed at Camborne Trevithick Day 2001, the day chosen for the celebration of Trevithick&#x27;s public demonstration of the use of high-pressure steam. The team consisting of John Woodward, Mark Rivron and Sean Oliver, have continued to maintain and display the engine at various steam fairs across the country. The &quot;Puffing Devil&quot; has proudly led the parade of steam engines at every subsequent Trevithick day up to and including 2014.

Trevithick Drive in Temple Hill, Dartford, was named after Richard Trevithick.

====Legacy====
The Trevithick Society, a successor to industrial archaeology organizations that were initially formed to rescue the Levant winding engine from being scrapped, was named in honor of Richard Trevithick. They publish a newsletter, a journal and many books on Cornish engines, the mining industry, engineers, and other industrial archaeological topics.

The active Trevithick Society is not to be confused with the former Trevithick Trust, registered by the Charity Commission in 1994 and removed (ceased to exist) in 2006. The Trevithick Trust attracted grants and did work at various sites in Cornwall, including King Edward Mine.

There is also a street named after Trevithick in Merthyr Tydfil.

Richard Trevithick is celebrated in Camborne, Cornwall on Trevithick Day which is held annually on the last Saturday in April. The day is a community festival with steam engines from all over the UK attending. Towards the end of the day they parade through the streets of Camborne and steam past a statue of Richard Trevithick outside the Passmore Edwards building.

Harry Turtledove&#x27;s alternate history short story &quot;The Iron Elephant&quot; has a character named Richard Trevithick inventing a steam engine in 1782 and subsequently racing a woolly mammoth-drawn train that it would in time come to supplant. The character was born sometime before 1771, and is American rather than British, indicating he is an analog, rather than the historical figure.

The greatest legacy of Trevithick, of course, is that he set into motion the railway age, and proved that high pressure steam engines were the way forward from low pressure engines. After him came George and Robert Stephenson who created viable locomotives and commercially viable railways, but they only built on what Trevithick laid down before them.

<doc id="234548" wikidata="Q168702" url="?curid=234548" title="Lhotse">
<text>Lhotse ( ; ; ) is the fourth-highest mountain on Earth, after Mount Everest, K2, and Kangchenjunga. At an elevation of above sea level, the main summit is on the border between Tibet Autonomous Region of China and the Khumbu region of Nepal.

With Everest to the north and Nuptse to the west, Lhotse forms the apex of the massive horseshoe-shaped arc of the Everest massif. Despite the tremendous vertical relief of its South and Northeast Faces, it is the least prominent of the eight-thousanders due to the great height of the South Col between it and Everest. Lhotse&#x27;s Western Face, recessed behind the head of the Khumbu Glacier in the Western Cwm, plays an integral part in the standard routes of ascent for both peaks. The name &quot;Lhotse&quot;, which means &quot;South Peak&quot; in Tibetan, further emphasizes the close relationship between the two.

The main ridge of the mountain features four distinct summits: Lhotse Main at AMSL, Lhotse Middle (also called Lhotse Central I or Lhotse East) at , Lhotse Central II at , and Lhotse Shar at . Though Lhotse Main is considered to be an intermediately difficult eight-thousander when ascended from the standard Reiss Couloir route, its secondary summits and extremely steep South Face are regarded as some of the most difficult and dangerous climbs in the world. Its icy North East Face remains unclimbed.

==Climbing==
An early attempt on Lhotse was made by the 1955 International Himalayan Expedition, headed by Norman Dyhrenfurth. It also included two Austrians (cartographers Erwin Schneider and Ernst Senn) and two Swiss (Bruno Spirig and Arthur Spöhel), and was the first expedition in the Everest area to include Americans (Fred Beckey, George Bell, and Richard McGowan). The Nepalese liaison officer was Gaya Nanda Vaidya. They were accompanied by 200 local porters and several climbing Sherpas. After a brief look at the dangerous southern approaches of Lhotse Shar, they turned their attention, during September and October, to the Western Cwm and the northwest face of Lhotse, on which they achieved an altitude of about . They were beaten back by unexpectedly strong wind and low temperatures. Under Schneider&#x27;s direction, they completed the first map of the Everest area (1:50,000 photogrammetric). The expedition also made several short films covering local cultural topics and made a number of first ascents of smaller peaks in the Khumbu region.

The main summit of Lhotse was first climbed on 18 May 1956, by the Swiss team of Ernst Reiss and Fritz Luchsinger, members of the Swiss Mount Everest/Lhotse Expedition.

On 12 May 1970, Sepp Mayerl and Rolf Walter of Austria made the first ascent of Lhotse Shar.

On 12 May 1999, Czech climber Soňa Vomáčková reached the main summit and thus became the first woman to reach it without supplemental oxygen. 

Lhotse Middle remained, for a long time, the highest unclimbed named point on Earth; its first ascent was made on 23 May 2001 by Eugeny Vinogradsky, Sergei Timofeev, Alexei Bolotov and Petr Kuznetsov of a Russian expedition.

The Lhotse standard climbing route follows the same path as Everest&#x27;s South Col route up to the Yellow Band beyond Camp 3. After the Yellow Band, the routes diverge with climbers bound for Everest taking a left over the Geneva Spur up to the South Col, while Lhotse climbers take a right further up the Lhotse face. The last part to the summit leads through the narrow &quot;Reiss couloir&quot; until the Lhotse main peak is reached.

By December 2008, 371 climbers had summited Lhotse while 20 had died during their attempt. Lhotse was not summited in 2014, 2015, or 2016 due to a series of incidents. It was next summited in May 2017.

===Lhotse Face===
The western flank of Lhotse is known as the &quot;Lhotse Face&quot;. Any climber bound for the South Col on Everest must climb this wall of glacial blue ice. This face rises at 40 and 50-degree pitches with the occasional 80-degree bulges. High-altitude climbing Sherpas and the lead climbers will set fixed ropes up this wall of ice. Climbers and porters need to establish a good rhythm of foot placement and pull themselves up the ropes using their jumars. Two rocky sections called the Yellow Band and the Geneva Spur interrupt the icy ascent on the upper part of the face.

On 19 May 2016, a high-altitude mountain worker, Ang Furba Sherpa, died when he slipped and fell down the Lhotse face.

<text>The Mann Cup is the trophy awarded to the senior men&#x27;s box lacrosse champions of Canada. The championship is a best-of-seven, East vs West series played between the league champions of Major Series Lacrosse, the East, and Western Lacrosse Association, the West.

The original trophy is now permanently located in the Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame. It is one of the most valuable in all of sports; made of solid, albeit low-karat, gold, the trophy was valued at CA$60,000 () when appraised by Birks in May 1980.

== History ==

It was donated in 1910 by Sir Donald Mann; prior to then, the Minto Cup was the senior amateur championship trophy. The Mann Cup was originally a challenge trophy, but in 1925 the champion New Westminster Salmonbellies turned the trophy over to the Canadian Lacrosse Association who instituted a national playoff system. The challenges and championships for the Mann Cup were played by the rules of traditional field lacrosse until 1932, when box lacrosse was adopted by the Canadian Lacrosse Association. The first indoor Mann Cup was played at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto in October 1932.

There have actually been three Mann Cup trophies in existence - the original and two replicas. The original 1910 trophy was in use from 1910 until 1985, when it was retired permanently to the Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame. A replica trophy, which has a larger and taller base than the original 1910 trophy, was in use and awarded to teams from 1986 until 2004 when it was destroyed in a bonfire mishap in Peterborough. The second replica replaced the first replica in 2005, and its appearance mirrors the previous 1986 replica trophy and not the original 1910 trophy.

==1914 Calgary Chinooks dispute==
In 1914, the Vancouver Athletic Club defeated the Calgary Chinooks and Brampton Excelsiors in Mann Cup challenge matches but the Mann Cup Trustees disputed the status of one of the Vancouver players in the series versus Brampton.

Despite the views of British Columbia lacrosse, national lacrosse and amateur athletic organisations that supported Vancouver&#x27;s position, the trustees instead awarded the cup to the Calgary Chinooks on September 29, 1914. Vancouver however held on to the gold trophy and refused to turn it over to either the trustees or the Chinooks. On December 7, 1914, the Canadian Amateur Lacrosse Association overruled Mann Cup trustee Joseph Lally and awarded the cup to the Vancouver Athletic Club.

==1922 Vancouver Lacrosse Club==
In 1922, there were two rival leagues located in British Columbia battling for the Mann Cup: Vancouver Lacrosse Club and Victoria Capitals played in the British Columbia Amateur Lacrosse Association&#x27;s senior league while the New Westminster Salmonbellies and Vancouver Elks played in the Pacific Coast Amateur Lacrosse Association. Control of the Mann Cup was retained by the BCALA after New Westminster left that league to join the PCALA. Vancouver Lacrosse Club won their schedule and were awarded the Mann Cup, while New Westminster won their series in the PCALA.

Just over a month later, Vancouver Lacrosse Club and New Westminster met in a three-game, total goals series to determine who would take home the Mann and Kilmarnock Cups. After Vancouver (who were at the time considered the holders of the Mann Cup) were up 7–6 in goals after two games, they then defaulted their third game after a brawl broke out and the team refused to return to the field. The score was 1-1, so New Westminster lined up and they then went through the formal motions of scoring two unopposed goals into the empty net to take the series and the silverware back by 9 goals to 8.

==1963 Cornwall, Ontario series==

In 1963, Cornwall, Ontario was named as host city for the Mann Cup despite not even having a senior lacrosse team nor ever participating in the Mann Cup previously.

The Western teams at that time were dominating play in Canada over their Eastern brethren, and had turned down their rights for hosting that year as they wanted the finals held in the East for successive back-to-back years to help stimulate and rejuvenate interest in the sport and the tournament. However, none of the then-current teams in the Ontario Lacrosse Association league had, or could raise, the $10,000 required by the host for the performance bond posted with the Canadian Lacrosse Association.

Officials in Cornwall stepped up and in August 1963 the city was awarded the hosting rights for the 1963 Mann Cup. When the CLA had issues getting officials, Stewart Begg age 16, stepped in to officiate

==Cup mishaps==
In 1989, the Mann Cup was stolen from the Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame in New Westminster, British Columbia. Despite fears of the cup being melted down for its gold content, it turned up a few weeks later, with a small chunk cut out of the rim, but otherwise intact.

Following the 1999 Mann Cup final, the cup broke during the post-game &quot;victory lap&quot; taken by the Victoria Shamrocks around Memorial Arena.

In 2004, the Peterborough Lakers won the Mann Cup. During a celebratory gathering the replica of the trophy was dropped in a bonfire and was destroyed.

<doc id="234554" wikidata="Q582763" url="?curid=234554" title="Hikaru no Go">
<text>is a Japanese manga series based on the board game Go, written by Yumi Hotta and illustrated by Takeshi Obata. The production of the series&#x27; Go games was supervised by Go professional Yukari Umezawa. It was serialized in Shueisha&#x27;s &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; from 1998 to 2003, with its chapters collected into 23 volumes. The story follows Hikaru, who discovers a Go board in his grandfather&#x27;s attic. The object turns out to be haunted by a ghost named Sai, the emperor&#x27;s former Go teacher in the Heian era. Sai finds himself trapped in Hikaru&#x27;s mind and tells him which moves to play against opponents, astonishing onlookers with the boy&#x27;s apparent level of skill at the game.

It was adapted into an anime television series by Studio Pierrot, which ran for 75 episodes from 2001 to 2003 on TV Tokyo, with a New Year&#x27;s Special aired in January 2004. Viz Media released both the manga and anime in North America; they serialized the manga in &quot;Shonen Jump&quot;, released its collected volumes in entirety, and the anime aired simultaneously on ImaginAsian.

&quot;Hikaru no Go&quot; has been well-received. The manga has had over 25 million copies in circulation, making it one of the best-selling manga series. It won the 45th Shogakukan Manga Award in 2000 and the 7th Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize in 2003. It is largely responsible for popularizing Go among the youth of Japan since its debut and is considered by Go players everywhere to have sparked worldwide interest in the game, noticeably increasing the Go-playing population around the globe.

==Plot==

While exploring his grandfather&#x27;s shed, Hikaru Shindo stumbles across a Go board haunted by the spirit of Fujiwara-no-Sai, a Go player from the Heian era. Sai wishes to play Go again, having not been able to since the late Edo period when his ghost appeared to Honinbo Shusaku, a top Go player of that period. Sai&#x27;s greatest desire is to attain the – a perfect move. Since Hikaru is the only person who can perceive him, Sai inhabits a part of Hikaru&#x27;s mind as a separate personality although not always comfortably.

Urged by Sai, Hikaru begins playing Go despite his lack of interest in the game. He begins to execute moves that Sai dictates to him. Hikaru begins his Go career in a Go salon, where he defeats a young boy playing at a professional level, Akira Toya, twice by following Sai&#x27;s instructions. He subsequently begins a quest to discover the source of Hikaru&#x27;s strength, an obsession that will dominate his life. Hikaru becomes intrigued by the great dedication of Akira and Sai to the game and decides to start playing solely on his own. He is a complete novice at first but has some unique abilities to his advantage. For instance, once he has a basic understanding of Go, he can reconstruct a game play-by-play from memory. Through training at Go clubs, study groups, and practice games with Sai, he becomes an Insei and later a pro, meeting various dedicated Go players of different ages and styles along the way. He also demonstrates a natural talent for the game and remains determined to prove his own abilities to Akira, Sai, and himself.

Hikaru enters the Hokuto Cup, an international tournament for under-18 Japanese, Chinese, and Korean Go professionals. As the highest-ranking under-18 pro, Akira qualifies for the tournament, but Hikaru has to compete in a series of games to become one of the three Japanese competitors. His friends Waya and Ochi also enter the qualifying matches. He meets Kiyoharu Yashiro, a player from the Kansai Ki-in, whose style is as strange and offbeat as his own. Hikaru, along with Akira and Kiyoharu Yashiro, are selected to represent Japan, while Suyong Hong (a Korean Go player who was beaten by Hikaru earlier in the series) and two others represent Korea and three of Shinichiro Isumi&#x27;s Chinese friends represent their country.

The captain of the Korean Go team, Ko Yong Ha, is interviewed and his remarks are translated for Japanese viewers. The translator makes an error which causes it to appear that he is disparaging the skill of Honinbo Shusaku, who, like Hikaru, was possessed by Sai. Although Ko Yong Ha later finds out, he refuses to correct the error and instead emphasizes it when he realizes that it enrages Hikaru, who takes it as a direct affront to Sai. Considering their achievements and skills, Hikaru is still slightly under Akira. Therefore, their team coach, Atsushi Kurata, chooses Akira to be captain. However, Hikaru wants to play against Ko Yong Ha to show him that Sai is the most skillful Go player in the game&#x27;s history. Atsushi Kurata grants Hikaru&#x27;s request when they play against Korea in the tournament because he sees the burning spirit in him. In the end, Hikaru loses by only half a point. Japan eventually comes in last, behind Korea and China. However, the Japanese team impressed both professionals from China and Korea because they did much better than expected. At the end of the game, Ko Yong Ha asks Hikaru for his reason for playing Go. With tears in his eyes, he answers with the line &quot;To link the far past, with the far future&quot;. The hidden meaning of this line indicates the links and emotional relationships between Sai, Shusaku, and Hikaru. However, no one understands the context of this line besides Hikaru.

A bonus story, set shortly after the Hokuto Cup event, shows two Inseis ranked 14th and 16th, discussing whether Akira Toya or Hikaru Shindo is stronger. In the Young Lions tournament, they are each paired with Hikaru and Akira, making them change their minds about who is stronger. In the second round, Hikaru and Akira are paired against each other and begin a match but the conclusion is unknown.

The series debuted in the January 2004 issue of Viz&#x27;s &quot;Shonen Jump&quot; magazine, released in December 2003. However, after the April 2008 issue it was replaced by &quot;Slam Dunk&quot;. They released all 23 collected volumes from May 19, 2004, to May 3, 2011.

===Anime===

&quot;Hikaru no Go&quot; was adapted into an anime television series by Studio Pierrot. It was broadcast on TV Tokyo from October 10, 2001, to March 26, 2003, for 75 episodes. A New Year&#x27;s Special titled aired on January 3, 2004.

Viz Media acquired the North American English-language rights to the &quot;Hikaru no Go&quot; anime at the same time as the manga, in June 2003. The Ocean Group produced an English voice dub for the series. A &quot;Sneak Preview&quot; DVD of the first episode was included in the January 2006 issue of &quot;Shonen Jump&quot; (Volume 4, Issue 1) to subscribers. Viz began releasing the series on DVD on December 27, 2005.

===Live-action drama===
A 36-episode Chinese live-action adaptation titled &quot;Qi Hun&quot;, directed by Liu Chang, was streamed on the iQIYI online platform from October 27 to November 26, 2020.

==Reception==
===Manga===
By May 2013, the manga had over 25 million copies in circulation. &quot;Hikaru no Go&quot; won the 45th Shogakukan Manga Award in 2000; and the seventh Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize in 2003. In November 2014, readers of &quot;Da Vinci&quot; magazine voted &quot;Hikaru no Go&quot; 14th on a list of &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot;″s greatest manga series of all time. On TV Asahi&#x27;s Manga Sōsenkyo 2021 poll, in which 150,000 people voted for their top 100 manga series, &quot;Hikaru no Go&quot; ranked 82nd.

&quot;Hikaru no Go&quot; dramatically increased the popularity of Go in Japan and elsewhere, particularly among young children. As a result, many Go clubs were started by people influenced by the manga. Go professional Yukari Umezawa served as the technical advisor for the anime and promoted the game on behalf of the Nihon Ki-in. She had a short one-minute special at the end of every episode instructing how to play Go.

Including it on a list of the best continuing manga of 2008, &quot;About.com&quot;&#x27;s Deb Aoki wrote that &quot;Hikaru no Go&quot; &quot;pulls off a pretty amazing feat&quot; by taking a complex game most American manga readers have never heard of and making it &quot;as fun, exciting and accessible as any competitive sport.&quot; Reviewing the series for the School Library Journal, Lori Henderson highly recommended &quot;Hikaru no Go&quot; as a &quot;funny, touching, and slightly bittersweet&quot; coming-of-age story. She praised Hotta&#x27;s diverse and interesting characters who have rather complex relationships, and Takeshi&#x27;s artwork, which &quot;can make placing a stone on the board seem like a life or death situation.&quot; Henderson noted that, while some technical terms are used and explained, readers do not have to know how to play Go as the matches are more about the players than the actual mechanics of the game. She also noted that the ending of the series did not live up to its full potential.

===Anime===
In 2004, &quot;Hikaru no Go&quot; came in 18th on &quot;Animage&quot; readers poll of their Favorite Anime Series. In TV Asahi&#x27;s 2008 Top 100 Anime poll, the series came in 83rd in the nationwide survey of multiple age groups and 93rd in the online poll. The following year, it came in 81st in the online poll.
