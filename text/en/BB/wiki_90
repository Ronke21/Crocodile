<text>Susan Kay Quatro (born June 3, 1950) is an American singer, bass guitarist, songwriter, and actress. In the 1970s, she scored a string of singles that found success in Europe and Australia, with both &quot;Can the Can&quot; (1973) and &quot;Devil Gate Drive&quot; (1974) reaching number one in several countries.

Quatro released her self-titled debut album in 1973. Since then, she has released 15 studio albums, 10 compilation albums, and one live album. Other songs, including &quot;48 Crash&quot;, &quot;Daytona Demon&quot;, &quot;The Wild One&quot;, and &quot;Your Mama Won&#x27;t Like Me&quot;, also charted highly overseas. Following a recurring role as bass player Leather Tuscadero on the popular American sitcom &quot;Happy Days&quot;, her duet &quot;Stumblin&#x27; In&quot; with Smokie&#x27;s lead singer Chris Norman reached number four in the US, her only song to chart in the top 40 in her homeland.

Between 1973 and 1980, Quatro was awarded six Bravo Ottos, an award given to musicians as voted in the German teen magazine &quot;Bravo&quot;. In 2010, she was voted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends online Hall of Fame. She is reported to have sold over 50 million records worldwide, and continues to perform live. Quatro&#x27;s most recent studio album, &quot;Face to Face&quot;, was released in 2023 and follows the 2021 collaboration &quot;The Devil in Me&quot; with her son Richard Tuckey, who had already taken part in &quot;No Control&quot; in 2019. Quatro also remains active in radio broadcasting.

== Early life ==
Quatro was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan, United States. Her father, Art, was a semiprofessional musician and worked at General Motors. Her paternal grandfather was an Italian immigrant to the U.S. and her mother, Helen, was Hungarian and she died in 1992. Her family name of &quot;Quattrocchi&quot; (&quot;four eyes&quot;, meaning &quot;bespectacled&quot;) was shortened to Quatro. Quatro&#x27;s family was living in Detroit when she was born. She has three sisters, a brother (Michael Quatro), and one older half-sister. Her parents fostered several other children while she was growing up. Quatro grew up to be an &quot;extrovert but solitary,&quot; according to Philip Norman of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, and she only became close to her mother after leaving the U.S. for Britain.

Her sister Arlene is the mother of actress Sherilyn Fenn. Her sister Patti joined Fanny, one of the earliest all-female rock bands to gain national attention. Her brother, Michael Quatro, is also a musician.

She was influenced at the age of six by seeing Elvis Presley perform on television. She has said that she had no direct female role models in music, but was inspired by Billie Holiday and liked the dress sense of Mary Weiss of the Shangri-Las &quot;because she wore tight trousers and a waistcoat on top she looked hot&quot;.

Quatro received formal training in playing classical piano and percussion—her first instrument was bongos. She taught herself how to play the bass, after her sister asked her to learn it for her first band, the Pleasure Seekers. Her father gave her a 1957 Fender Precision bass guitar in 1964, which she still uses in the studio.

==Career==

===Early career and the Art Quatro Trio===
Quatro played drums or percussion from an early age as part of her father&#x27;s jazz band, the Art Quatro Trio. Sources vary regarding whether her playing in the band began at the age of seven or eight, and whether the instrument she played was a drum kit or percussion (bongo or congas). Subsequently, she appeared on local television as a go-go dancer in a pop music series.

===The Pleasure Seekers and Cradle===
In 1964, after seeing a television performance by the Beatles, Quatro&#x27;s older sister, Patti, had formed an all-female garage rock band called the Pleasure Seekers with two friends. Quatro joined, too, and assumed the stage name of Suzi Soul; Patti Quatro was known as Patti Pleasure. Suzi sang and played bass in the band. The band also later featured another sister, Arlene. Many of their performances were in cabarets, where attention was (initially) focused more on their physical looks than their actual music. They sometimes had to wear miniskirts and wigs, which Quatro later considered to be necessary evils in the pursuit of success. They became well-known fixtures, though, in the burgeoning Detroit music community.

The Pleasure Seekers recorded three singles and released two: &quot;Never Thought You&#x27;d Leave Me&quot; / &quot;What a Way to Die&quot; (1966) and &quot;Light of Love&quot; / &quot;Good Kind of Hurt&quot; (1968). The second of these was released by Mercury Records, with whom they briefly had a contract before breaking away due to differences of opinion regarding their future direction. They changed their name to Cradle in late 1969, not long after another Quatro sister, Nancy, had joined the band and Arlene had left following the birth of her child.

===Work with Mickie Most===

Quatro moved to England in 1971, after being spotted by record producer Mickie Most, who had by that time founded his own label, Rak Records. Most had been persuaded to see Cradle by her brother Michael, who was managing the band. Like other music producers at the time, Most was looking for a female rock singer who could fill the void created by the death of Janis Joplin. According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot;, his attention to Quatro was drawn by &quot;her comeliness and skills as bass guitarist, singer, and chief show-off in Cradle.&quot;

She had also been attracting attention from Elektra Records, and subsequently explained, &quot;According to the Elektra president, I could become the new Janis Joplin. Mickie Most offered to take me to England and make me the first Suzi Quatro – I didn&#x27;t want to be the new anybody.&quot; Most had no interest in the other band members and he had no idea at that time of how he might market Quatro. She spent a year living in a hotel while being nurtured by Most, developing her skills and maturing. Most later said that the outcome was a reflection of her own personality.

Quatro&#x27;s first single, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, was successful only in Portugal, where it reached number one on the charts. This was a solo effort, although aided by people such as Duncan Browne, Peter Frampton and Alan White. Subsequently, with the approval of Most, she auditioned for a band to accompany her. It was also after this record that Most introduced her to the songwriting and production team of Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman, who wrote songs specifically to accord with her image. She agreed with Most&#x27;s assessment of her image, saying that his influence, at which some of his artists such as Jeff Beck and Rod Stewart balked, did not extend to manufacture and that &quot;If he tried to build me into a Lulu, I wouldn&#x27;t have it. I&#x27;d say &#x27;go to hell&#x27; and walk out.&quot; This was the height of the glam rock period of the 1970s and Quatro, who wore leather clothes, portrayed a wild image while playing music that &quot;hinged mostly on a hard rock chug beneath lyrics in which scansion overruled meaning.&quot;

In 1972, Quatro embarked as a support act on a UK tour with Thin Lizzy and headliners Slade. Rak Records arranged for her to use Thin Lizzy&#x27;s newly acquired PA system during this, incurring a charge of £300 per week that enabled the Irish band to effectively purchase it at no cost to themselves. In May 1973, her second single &quot;Can the Can&quot; (1973) which Philip Auslander describes as having &quot;seemingly nonsensical and virtually unintelligible lyrics&quot; was a number-one hit in parts of Europe and in Australia.

&quot;Can the Can&quot; was followed by three further hits: &quot;48 Crash&quot; (1973), &quot;Daytona Demon&quot; (1973), and &quot;Devil Gate Drive&quot; (1974), each of which sold over one million copies and were awarded gold discs, although they met with little success in her native United States, where she had toured as a support act for Alice Cooper. Rak Records&#x27; artists had generally not succeeded in the US and her first album, &quot;Suzi Quatro&quot;, was criticised by Alan Betrock for its lack of variety, for its Quatro-written &quot;second-rate fillers&quot; and for her voice, described as &quot;often too high and shrill, lacking punch or distinctive phrasing.&quot; Writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Greg Shaw was also downbeat, saying that the album &quot;may be a necessary beginning&quot;.

In 1973, Quatro played on the Cozy Powell hit &quot;Dance With the Devil&quot;, a track written by Mickie Most while Cozy Powell was part of the Rak Records roster.

Musicians who acted as her backing band around this period included Alastair McKenzie, Dave Neal, and Len Tuckey, with Robbie Blunt also being listed by some sources. Tuckey&#x27;s brother, Bill, acted as tour manager.

With the exception of Australia, her chart success faltered thereafter, as proven with her 1975 hit &quot;Your Mamma Won&#x27;t Like Me&quot;, which proved to be a moderate success in the UK. Further singles, &quot;I Bit off More Than I Could Chew&quot; and &quot;I May Be Too Young&quot;, both failed to reach the UK Top 50. Quatro recorded the album &quot;Aggro-Phobia&quot; in 1976 and released a new single in 1977 called &quot;Tear Me Apart&quot;, which reached the UK top 30, her first hit to have done so in three years. Another year passed before she had another big hit, this time with a change to a more mellow style giving Quatro a 1978 single &quot;If You Can&#x27;t Give Me Love&quot; that became a hit there and in the United Kingdom. Later that year, &quot;Stumblin&#x27; In&quot;, a duet with Chris Norman of the band Smokie, reached number four in the US. Both tracks were featured on the &quot;If you knew Suzi...&quot; album. A year later, Quatro released &quot;Suzi ... and Other Four Letter Words,&quot; but none of her other work had much US success. This featured the hits &quot;She&#x27;s in Love with You&quot;, which made number 11 in Britain, &quot;Mama&#x27;s Boy&quot; (number 34), and &quot;I&#x27;ve Never Been in Love&quot; (number 56).

===Mike Chapman and Dreamland records===

In 1980, after Quatro&#x27;s contract with Mickie Most had expired, she signed with Chapman&#x27;s Dreamland Records.

In the same year, she released the album &quot;Rock Hard&quot;; both the album and title single went platinum in Australia. &quot;Rock Hard&quot; was also used in the cult film &quot;Times Square&quot; and was included on the soundtrack album. The single reached number 11 in Australia, but only 68 in the UK due to distribution problems. At this point her hit single career clearly was beginning to wane. A second single from the &quot;Rock Hard&quot; album, titled &quot;Lipstick&quot;, was released in February 1981, but radio refused to play it, as they claimed it sounded too much like &quot;Gloria&quot; by Them. &quot;Suzi Quatro&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;, which was released in 1980, peaked at number four in the UK charts, becoming her highest-charting album there.

===Independence===
After Chapman&#x27;s Dreamland Records folded in 1981, Quatro was left without a record label.

Her last UK hit for some time was &quot;Heart of Stone&quot; in late 1982. In 1983, another single &quot;Main Attraction&quot; was released. It failed to chart, but did become a moderate airplay hit. She commented in an article for &quot;Kerrang!&quot; in 1983, after playing a successful show at Reading Festival on August 27, that she did not care about being in the charts, but was more interested in releasing what she wanted to, commenting that she started in 1964, and did not become famous for nine years. &quot;I would never accept having my career molded by other people ... I&#x27;ve kept working consistently even though I&#x27;ve not been in the charts.&quot;

Around this time, Quatro recorded a new album that was shelved until 1997, when it was issued as &quot;Unreleased Emotion&quot;. Quatro briefly returned to recording for two more singles, &quot;I Go Wild&quot; in 1984, and in 1985 her &quot;Tonight I Could Fall in Love&quot;/&quot;Good Girl (Looking for a Bad Time)&quot; single reached number 140 in the UK charts. Quatro also collaborated with Bronski Beat and members of the Kinks, Eddie and the Hot Rods, and Dr. Feelgood on the Mark Cunningham-produced cover version of David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Heroes&quot;, released the following year as the 1986 BBC &quot;Children in Need&quot; single. Quatro also released a cover version of &quot;Wild Thing&quot; in November 1986, as a duet with The Troggs singer Reg Presley. &quot;Can the Can&quot;/&quot;Devil Gate Drive&quot; were re-released in 1987 as a single and reached number 87 in the UK charts. She was also part of the Ferry Aid charity single &quot;Let It Be&quot;, which was a UK number one, 13 years and 26 days after Quatro&#x27;s last UK number-one song.

In 1989, Quatro released a prerecorded backing track single &quot;Baby You&#x27;re a Star&quot;, which was released in the UK, though it failed to chart. By the late &#x27;80s, Quatro&#x27;s hitmaking days were clearly over, though she still recorded persistently despite lack of chart success. During the &#x27;90s, Quatro released four new albums, though &quot;Unreleased Emotion&quot; had been recorded several years previously. &quot;What Goes Around – Greatest &amp; Latest&quot; was released in 1995 and consisted of mainly older hits rerecorded; this proved a success in Denmark. Except for 1999&#x27;s &quot;Free the Butterfly&quot; self-help album, a further 11 years were needed for Quatro to release a new album. &quot;Back to the Drive&quot; in 2006 showed a return to Quatro&#x27;s harder rock roots, rather than the smoother sounds of her previous albums. &quot;Back to the Drive&quot; also returned Quatro to the worldwide charts – her first album to do so since the &#x27;80s &quot;Rock Hard&quot;. &quot;Back to the Drive&quot; also produced a download-only single, &quot;I&#x27;ll Walk Through the Fire with You&quot;. Quatro released &quot;In the Spotlight&quot; in 2011 with the lead single, &quot;Whatever Love Is&quot;. Quatro marked her 50th anniversary in the music industry with an anthology, &quot;Girl from Detroit&quot;, in 2014 with two new tracks.

Around 2005, a documentary chronicling Quatro&#x27;s life, &quot;Naked Under Leather&quot;, named after a 1975 bootleg album recorded in Japan, directed by a former member of the Runaways, Victory Tischler-Blue, was made, but this has never been released. In February 2006, Quatro released &quot;Back to the Drive&quot;, produced by Sweet guitarist Andy Scott. The album&#x27;s title track was written by her former collaborator, Chapman. In March 2007, Quatro released a cover version of the Eagles song &quot;Desperado&quot;, followed by the publication of her autobiography, &quot;Unzipped&quot;. By this time, Quatro had sold 50 million records.

On June 11, 2010, she headlined the &#x27;Girls Night Out&#x27; at the Isle of Wight Festival. Quatro was also inducted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends online Hall of Fame in 2010, following an on-line vote.

In August 2011, Quatro released her 15th studio album, &quot;In the Spotlight&quot; (and its single, &quot;Spotlight&quot;). This album is a mixture of new songs written by Mike Chapman and by herself, along with some cover versions. A second single from the album, &quot;Whatever Love Is&quot;, was subsequently released. On November 16, 2011, a music video (by Tischler-Blue) for the track &quot;Strict Machine&quot; was released onto the &quot;Suzi Quatro Official&quot; YouTube channel. The track is a cover of Goldfrapp&#x27;s &quot;Strict Machine&quot;, but Quatro&#x27;s version contains two lines from &quot;Can the Can&quot;, referencing the similarity of the tunes for the two songs.

In April 2013, she performed in America for the first time in over 30 years, at the Detroit Music Awards, where she received the Distinguished Lifetime Achievement Award, presented to her by her sister, Patti.

In 2017, Quatro released her 16th studio album backed by Andy Scott from Sweet on guitar and Don Powell from Slade on drums.

In August 2023, Quatro released an album of duets with KT Tunstall entitled &quot;Face to Face&quot;. After discovering they were mutual fans of each other, they were put in touch with each other by a mutual friend.

===Acting and radio hosting===
Quatro is possibly best known in the United States for her role as the bass player Leather Tuscadero on the television show &quot;Happy Days&quot;. The show&#x27;s producer, Garry Marshall, had offered her the role without having an audition after seeing a photograph of her on his daughter&#x27;s bedroom wall. Toby Mamis, who was acting as her U.S. representative at that time, helped broker the deal and generate enormous media attention to it, elevating Quatro&#x27;s profile in her home country. Leather was the younger sister of Fonzie&#x27;s former girlfriend, motorcycle trick rider Pinky Tuscadero. Leather fronted a rock band joined by principal characters Richie Cunningham, Potsie Weber, Ralph Malph, Chachi Arcola, and even Joanie Cunningham once. The character returned in other guest roles, including once for a date to a fraternity formal with Ralph Malph. Marshall offered Quatro a &quot;Leather Tuscadero&quot; spin-off, but she declined the offer, saying she did not want to be typecast.

Her other acting roles include a 1982 episode of the British comedy-drama series &quot;Minder&quot; (called &quot;Dead Men Do Tell Tales&quot;) as Nancy, the singer girlfriend of Terry (Dennis Waterman). In 1985, she starred as a mentally disturbed ex-MI5 operative in &quot;Dempsey and Makepeace&quot; – &quot;Love you to Death&quot;. In February 2022 Quatro gave an exclusive interview to Paul Stenning regarding her appearance in both shows.

In 1994, she made a cameo appearance as a nurse in the &quot;Hospital&quot; episode of the comedy &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;. She also was filmed in the 1990 Clive Barker horror film &quot;Nightbreed&quot;, but the studio cut out her character. In 2006, Quatro performed the voice of Rio in the &quot;Bob the Builder&quot; film &quot;Built to Be Wild&quot;, and appeared in an episode of the second season of &quot;Rock School&quot;, in Lowestoft. She also appeared in the episode &quot;The Axeman Cometh&quot; of &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; in the role of Mimi Clifton.

Quatro has also performed in theatre. In 1986, she appeared as Annie Oakley in a London production of &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot; and in 1991, she performed the title role in a musical about the life of actress Tallulah Bankhead. Titled &quot;Tallulah Who?&quot;, which had music and lyrics co-written by Shirlie Roden and her, with a book by Willie Rushton. It ran from February 14 to March 9 at Hornchurch, England, where it was billed as &quot;You&#x27;ll be amazed how Tallulah did it, and to whom and how often!&quot; The show received favorable reviews from the majority of critics.

In more recent times, Quatro has hosted weekly rock and roll programs on BBC Radio 2. The first one was titled &quot;Rockin&#x27; with Suzi Q&quot;, while her second was given the title &quot;Wake Up Little Suzi&quot;.

==Songwriting==
She started writing songs alone, then collaborated with other songwriters (such as Len Tuckey, Rhiannon Wolfe, and Shirley Roden), and now mainly writes songs alone once again.

Quatro&#x27;s early recorded songwriting was deliberately limited to album tracks and the B-sides of singles. She said in late 1973, &quot;...  [the] album tracks are a very different story from [the] singles. The two-minute low-and-behold commercial single will not come out of my brain, but ain&#x27;t I gonna worry about it.&quot;

She describes creating a new song: &quot;From sitting at my piano in my front room, writing down a title (always first), picking up my bass, figuring out the groove, going back to the piano ... working on the lyrics, playing electric guitar ... and finally I type out the lyrics. Only then is it officially a song. Next it goes down on my tiny 8-track, [with] me playing everything ... this is the version all muso&#x27;s use to get into the tune ... then into the studio and we go from there.&quot;

==Personal life==
Quatro married her long-time guitarist, Len Tuckey, in 1976. They had two children together, and divorced in 1992. Before 1993, Quatro lived with her two children in a manor house not far from Chelmsford in Essex, England, that Tuckey and she bought in 1980.

She married German concert promoter Rainer Haas in 1993. In 2006, her daughter and grandchild moved back into the Essex manor house. Toward the end of 2008, Quatro&#x27;s children had moved out of the house and she temporarily put it up for sale, stating that she had empty nest syndrome. Quatro continues to live in Essex and Hamburg, and sometimes in Detroit.

Since 2011, she has published music videos on YouTube. On March 31, 2012, Quatro broke her right knee and left wrist while boarding an aircraft in Kyiv, Ukraine, where she had performed the night before. As a result, she had to cancel her appearance at the Detroit Music Awards on April 27, where she was to perform and be inducted into the Detroit Hall of Fame along with her sisters. Had she been able to go, that would have been her first performance in America in over 30 years. Quatro also had to reschedule other concert dates, while some were canceled altogether.

==Public image==
In a 2012 interview, Quatro was asked what she thought she had achieved for female rockers in general. She replied: 

In a 1973 interview, Quatro sympathized with many of the opinions voiced by the women&#x27;s liberation movement, while distancing herself from it because she considered that the participants were The interviewer, Charles Shaar Murray, considered her viewpoint to be &quot;... somewhat anomalous, because unless the woman in question happens to be well known, she has no way of letting people hear her unless she unites with other women and then elects a spokesman.&quot; He also noted the apparent contradiction that Quatro seemed proud that girls were writing to her saying that they were emulating her look and her attitude. In 1974, Quatro believed that, unlike men, women were burdened with emotional responses and that it was more difficult for them to succeed in the music industry because they are more prone to jealousy and thus female audiences tend not to buy the recordings of female artists.

Her unusually free use of swear words in conversation was often picked upon by interviewers in the 1970s, as have been her diminutive stature and boy-ish nature. In 1974, Philip Norman said that 

==Awards and honours==
In 2020, Quatro was awarded the Icon Award by the Women&#x27;s International Music Network.

In 2011, Quatro was inducted to the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame.

In October 2016, Quatro received an honorary doctorate in music from Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge, UK, along with Dr. Feelgood&#x27;s Wilko Johnson.

On August 15, 2019, an Australian-made film on the life of Quatro premiered in Melbourne, Victoria. &quot;Suzi Q&quot; is noted as the first official documentary to ever be released about her. It was described by Quatro as a &quot;warts and all&quot; look into her career, focusing on both her successes and challenges faced along the way, particularly as she left her sisters in Detroit to pursue a solo career in London. Quatro stated that she was drawn to having Melbourne-based director Liam Firmager make the film, &quot;Because although he liked my music, he wasn&#x27;t particularly &#x27;a fan&#x27;, which meant he was objective, and wouldn&#x27;t spend all his time telling me how great I am... I like that, he was the right guy for the job&quot;.

===Bravo Otto===
&quot;Bravo&quot; is the largest magazine for teenagers in German-speaking Europe. Each year, the readers of this magazine select the Bravo Otto award winners.

Quatro has won the following Bravo Otto awards:
* 1973 Gold for female singer
* 1974 Gold for female singer
* 1975 Bronze for female singer
* 1978 Bronze for female singer
* 1979 Bronze for female singer
* 1980 Silver for female singer

===Queens of British Pop===
In April 2009, BBC TV selected Quatro as one of 12 queens of British pop.

==Legacy and influence==

===Views of journalists and reviewers===
In August 1974, Simon Frith spotted a problem with the formula that was working outside the US, saying that 

In 1983, journalist Tom Hibbert wrote that Quatro may have overstated her role as a leading light among female rock musicians. He said that 

===Views of scholars===
In his 2008 paper &quot;Suzi Quatro: A prototype in the archsheology of rock&quot;, Frank Oglesbee writes, &quot;The rebellion of rock music was largely a male rebellion; the women—often, in the 1950s and &#x27;60s, girls in their teens—in rock usually sang songs as personæ utterly dependent on their macho boyfriends&quot;. He describes Quatro as &quot;a female rock pioneer, in some ways &quot;the&quot; female rock pioneer ... a cornerstone in the archaeology of rock.&quot; He said she grew up to become &quot;the first female lead singer and bassist, an electric ax-woman, who sang and played as freely as the males, inspiring other females.&quot;

Philip Auslander says, &quot;Although there were many women in rock by the late 1960s, most performed only as singers, a traditionally feminine position in popular music&quot;. Though some women (like Quatro herself) played instruments in American all-female garage rock bands, none of these bands achieved more than regional success. So, they &quot;did not provide viable templates for women&#x27;s on-going participation in rock&quot;. When Quatro emerged in 1973, &quot;no other prominent female musician worked in rock simultaneously as a singer, instrumentalist, songwriter, and bandleader&quot;. Auslander adds that in 2000 Quatro saw herself as &quot;kicking down the male door in rock and roll and proving that a female &quot;musician&quot; ... and this is a point I am extremely concerned about ... could play as well if not better than the boys&quot;.

===People and bands influenced by Quatro===
Quatro has influenced various female musicians. Musician Tina Weymouth, who played bass guitar in Talking Heads and Tom Tom Club, among other bands, first learned to play bass by listening to Quatro albums.

Quatro had a direct influence on the Runaways and Joan Jett, as well as Girlschool and Chrissie Hynde. Musician Kathy Valentine, best known for her work as bass player for The Go-Go&#x27;s, cited Quatro as a major influence in her 2020 autobiography &quot;All I Ever Wanted.&quot;

Mid-1990s American indie rock band Tuscadero was named after Quatro&#x27;s &quot;Happy Days&quot; character Leather Tuscadero, and their song &quot;Leather Idol&quot;, from their 1994 album &quot;The Pink Album&quot;, was an ode to both Quatro and her TV character.

On the cover of Scottish singer-songwriter KT Tunstall&#x27;s 2007 album &quot;Drastic Fantastic&quot;, Tunstall is dressed like Quatro, as a deliberate homage.

On October 24, 2013, Quatro received the Woman of Valor Award from the organization Musicians for Equal Opportunities for Women (MEOW) for her role inspiring and influencing generations of female musicians. The award was bestowed by Kathy Valentine (formerly of The Go-Go&#x27;s) at a dinner in her honor in Austin, Texas, at the Austin Renaissance Hotel. Quatro performed five songs with a local band that included her sister Patti and Tony Scalzo of the band Fastball on &quot;Stumblin In&quot;.

==Musical style==
Quatro&#x27;s music covers several genres. Her primary genres are hard rock and glam rock. Academic Philip Auslander wrote that &quot;she has appeared on occasion just as a bass player, not a singer, and [also] demonstrates her instrumental prowess with an extended bass guitar solo during her own concerts.&quot;

With the Pleasure Seekers, their musical styles and genres included power pop, garage rock and Motown. Quatro also performs musicals.

<text>The History Man is a campus novel by Malcolm Bradbury published in 1975. His best-known novel, it is a satire of academic life in the &quot;glass and steel&quot; universities, the ones established in the 1960s which followed the &quot;redbricks&quot;. In 1981 the book was made into a successful BBC television serial.

==Plot introduction==
Howard Kirk is a lecturer in sociology at the local university. He is a &quot;theoretician of sociability&quot;. The Kirks are trendy leftist people but living together for many years and the advance of middle age have left unfavourable traces in their relationship. It is Barbara Kirk who notices this change, whereas Howard is as enthusiastic and self-assured as always. Officially, the Kirks oppose traditional gender roles just as fiercely as the exploitation of humans by other humans. Practices have crept into their lives, which do not live up to such high standards, Howard writes books, while Barbara—stranded with much of the housework and two little children—would like to but never gets round to it. Any female student who comes to live with—rather than work for—them is made to babysit and perform domestic chores.

==Plot summary==
When Howard and Barbara meet in their third year at the University of Leeds, Howard is a virgin. They are religious, working-class and during their student years cannot afford more than the bare necessities of life. A few years after their graduation, in the summer of 1963, the &quot;old Kirks&quot;, already a married couple living in a small bedsit, metamorphose into the &quot;new Kirks&quot; when one day, while Howard is at the university where he works as a lecturer, Barbara has spontaneous, casual sex with an Egyptian student. This fling triggers a series of events. When he has got over the shock, Howard begins to associate with all kinds of radical people. The Kirks make many new friends. They smoke pot at parties, Barbara develops a new interest in health food and astrology, Howard grows a beard and they both start having &quot;small affairs&quot;. When Barbara gets pregnant, rather than cancelling his class, Howard takes his students to the clinic to watch his wife giving birth. Finally, in 1967, he is appointed lecturer at Watermouth and right from the start he is intent on radicalising that bourgeois town, especially the new university, an institution that he describes as &#x27;a place I can work against&#x27;.

The novel chronicles a term in the lives of Howard and Barbara. Howard&#x27;s intolerance concerning non-Marxist, especially conservative, thinking makes him persecute one of the male participants of his seminar who wears a university blazer and a tie (which make him look like a student from the 1950s) and insists on being allowed to present his paper in the traditional, formal way, without being interrupted and without having to answer questions before he has finished his train of thought. In front of the others Howard calls him a &quot;heavy, anal type&quot; and what he has prepared for class &quot;an anal, repressed paper&quot;, without considering his hypocrisy. Kirk succeeds in having the student, a &quot;historical irrelevance&quot;, expelled from the university.

Whereas Howard selects his many sexual partners from among the people who work at the university (students as well as faculty members) on Saturday mornings, Barbara Kirk regularly goes on &quot;shopping trips&quot; to London to visit the same young man. The Kirks consider the parties they throw in their house a success if at least some of their guests have sex in the many rooms they provide for it. At one point in the novel, Howard&#x27;s promiscuity gets him into trouble when he is told that he might be sacked for &quot;gross moral turpitude&quot; (which he defines to a female student of his as &quot;raping large numbers of nuns&quot;) but he shrugs off this accusation as being based on &quot;a very vague concept, especially these days&quot;.

A number of supporting characters round off the vivid picture of the permissive society of the early 1970s. There is Henry Beamish, one of Howard&#x27;s colleagues whose childless middle-class marriage to Myra has been largely unhappy. There is Dr. Macintosh, a sociologist from Howard&#x27;s department who, despite his pregnant wife, can be convinced by Howard that having sex with one of his students during the end-of-term party is the right thing to do. Flora Beniform is a social psychologist with rather unconventional research methods: she sleeps with men in whom she is professionally interested to elicit information.

At the end of the novel Howard and Barbara are still together and all their friends admire their stable yet &quot;advanced&quot; marriage. Howard has even further metamorphosed into &quot;the radical hero&quot; who is &quot;generating the onward march of mind, the onward process of history&quot;. According to his philosophy, things, especially those he likes, are bound to happen: this is called &quot;historical inevitability&quot;. The trajectory of the Kirks&#x27; life together ends when Barbara attempts suicide during a party.

<doc id="239435" wikidata="Q946728" url="?curid=239435" title="Keith Sweat">
<text>Keith Sweat (born July 22, 1961) is an American singer and songwriter. An early figure in the new jack swing musical movement, he is known for his collection of hits including &quot;I Want Her,&quot; &quot;Make It Last Forever,&quot; &quot;I&#x27;ll Give All My Love to You,&quot; &quot;Make You Sweat,&quot; &quot;Get Up on It,&quot; &quot;Twisted,&quot; and &quot;Nobody.&quot; He has released 13 solo albums (two as a part of the R&amp;B supergroup LSG) and discovered the groups Silk and Kut Klose. Sweat&#x27;s sound reportedly was influenced by Slave front man Steve Arrington and go-go music.

==Early life==
Sweat was born in Harlem, New York City to Juanita Thompson, a hairdresser, and Charles Crier, a factory worker. After Charles Crier&#x27;s passing in 1973, Juanita raised their five kids by herself. As a youth, Sweat performed at the famous Apollo Theater, which was near his home.

Before releasing his solo album, Sweat worked as a night stock worker at Macy&#x27;s Department Store, and then a mail room clerk at Paine Webber, a brokerage firm. Additionally, he earned a degree in communications from City College of New York. “I think everyone should have an alternative plan. In my case, I went to the City College of New York and got my degree in communications. So I had a backup plan so that I didn’t lose out on a decent future,” Sweat once said.

Within just four years, he worked his way up to a lucrative brokerage assistant job on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Sweat also worked as a supervisor for the New York Mercantile Exchange.

== Career ==
===1975–1984: Career beginnings with Jamilah===
Sweat started his musical career as a member of a Harlem band called Jamilah in 1975. With the help of Jamilah, Sweat was able to hone his craft as a lead singer by performing regionally throughout the Tri-state area of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. The group was started by bassist Larry Peoples, guitarist Michael Samuels, and drummer Walter Bradley.

After leaving the group in 1984 to begin a solo career, Sweat sang at nightclubs throughout New York City and landed a chance to record for the independent label, Stadium Records. Sweat recorded only two tunes for Stadium, &quot;Lucky Seven&quot; and &quot;My Mind Is Made Up,&quot; which was their third and fourth ever release, but on Stadium&#x27;s first release, he is credited as co-writer and co-producer of &quot;You Are the One for Me,&quot; the last recording ever made by the group GQ. One of GQ&#x27;s original members is his uncle, Keith &quot;Sabu&quot; Crier.

===1987–1989: &quot;Make It Last Forever&quot; and New Jack Swing===
Later in 1987, Keith Sweat was discovered by Vincent Davis and offered a recording contract with his label, Vintertainment Records, which was founded in 1983 on the foundations of early Hip-Hop and otherwise best known for releasing Joeski Love&#x27;s &quot;Pee Wee&#x27;s Dance&quot; in 1985. Vintertainment was distributed by Elektra Records from 1985 until it ceased operations in 1990.

While crafting his debut album, Sweat pursued fellow Harlem resident Teddy Riley, who, at this time, was better known for writing for and producing hip-hop artists. According to Riley, he already had the beats prepared for &quot;I Want Her&quot; and &quot;Make It Last Forever,&quot; along with all of the background vocals for &quot;I Want Her.&quot; Riley had no intention of producing R&amp;B music, and he also encouraged Sweat to sing in what would become his trademark nasal sound to distinguish his voice from other artists. Riley noted that Sweat&#x27;s songwriting style also was unique as he composed lyrics instantly while listening to the track, as he did for the single, &quot;Make It Last Forever.&quot;

On November 24, 1987, Sweat released &quot;Make It Last Forever&quot;, which sold three million copies. He and Riley co-wrote six songs, and the biggest hit inaugurated the new jack swing era, &quot;I Want Her&quot; (No. 1 R&amp;B &amp; No. 5 Pop), which was nominated for the 1989 Soul Train Best R&amp;B/Urban Contemporary Song of the Year award, while the title track from the album hit No. 2 on the R&amp;B charts.

=== 1990-1991: &quot;I&#x27;ll Give All My Love to You&quot;, and &quot;Keep It Comin&quot; ===
Sweat reached the charts again with his second album &quot;I&#x27;ll Give All My Love to You&quot; (1990) which hit No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. He released his third album, &quot;Keep It Comin&#x27;&quot; in 1991, which debuted in the Top 20 of the album chart. He produced soul singer Omar Chandler.

===1992–2001: &quot;Get Up on It&quot;, Keith Sweat/LSG ===
In 1992, Sweat discovered the group Silk, and helped craft their debut album, &quot;Lose Control&quot;, which hit No. 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart.

The album&#x27;s single &quot;Freak Me&quot; hit No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on May 1, 1993. In 1993, Sweat discovered the Atlanta-based female R&amp;B group Kut Klose. Sweat also produced the group&#x27;s debut album &quot;Surrender&quot;, which produced their biggest hit single &quot;I Like&quot;, peaking to No. 8 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp; Tracks chart.

Sweat released his fourth album &quot;Get Up on It&quot; in the summer of 1994, and his self-titled fifth album in 1996. Both albums reached the top ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The single co/produced and written by Eric McCaine &quot;Twisted&quot; featuring R&amp;B group Kut Klose hit No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and &quot;Nobody&quot; hit No. 3, which made them Sweat&#x27;s biggest hits to date. &quot;Just A Touch&quot; was a cover of the 1979 song &quot;Just a Touch of Love&quot; by Slave. He produced for R&amp;B group Dru Hill in 1996.

In the fall of 1997, Sweat discovered the group Ol&#x27; Skool and helped with their self-titled debut. He was on their biggest single, &quot;Am I Dreaming&quot;, which featured the R&amp;B group Xscape. Sweat also formed the R&amp;B supergroup LSG with Gerald Levert and Johnny Gill, and released their self-titled debut album &quot;Levert.Sweat.Gill&quot; in 1997. That album featured &quot;My Body&quot;, which became a hit single. The album was certified double platinum and reached No. 4 on the U.S. Billboard 200.

Sweat&#x27;s sixth album, &quot;Still in the Game&quot; was released in 1998, hitting No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and No. 2 on the R&amp;B/Hip Hop albums chart. It featured the singles &quot;Come and Get With Me&quot; (which featured rapper Snoop Dogg) (No. 12 Hot 100) and &quot;I&#x27;m Not Ready&quot; (No. 16 Hot 100). Sweat&#x27;s success on the charts started to diminish in 2000, when he released the album &quot;Didn&#x27;t See Me Coming&quot;. None of the singles from the album reached the top forty.

===2002–present: &quot;Rebirth, Just Me, Ridin Solo&quot;, and &quot;Til the Morning&quot;===

On August 13, 2002, Keith Sweat released his eighth album, &quot;Rebirth&quot;. The single &quot;One on One&quot; reached No. 75 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 44 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp; Tracks chart. His 2008 album &quot;Just Me&quot; included the single, &quot;Love U Better (featuring Keyshia Cole)&quot;. Sweat is currently signed to Kedar Records and released his tenth studio album entitled &quot;Ridin&#x27; Solo&quot; on June 22, 2010. The lead single taken from the album is &quot;Test Drive&quot; and featured label-mate Joe. 

Since 2007, Sweat has been the host of &quot;The Keith Sweat Hotel&quot; —a nationally syndicated radio program with Premiere Networks based upon the Quiet storm format.

== Personal life ==
From 1992 until 2002, Sweat was married to &quot;The Real Housewives of Atlanta&quot; star Lisa Wu Hartwell. With her, he had two sons, born in 1995 and 1998.

He also has three daughters, one with Tracy J. He also has a son named Joshua.

<doc id="239439" wikidata="Q2912387" url="?curid=239439" title="Servant leadership">
<text>Servant leadership is a leadership philosophy in which the goal of the leader is to serve. This is different from traditional leadership where the leader&#x27;s main focus is the thriving of their company or organization. A servant leader shares power, puts the needs of the employees first and helps people develop and perform as highly as possible. Instead of the people working to serve the leader, the leader exists to serve the people. As stated by its founder, Robert K. Greenleaf, a servant leader should be focused on &quot;Do those served grow as persons? Do they, while being served, become healthier, wiser, freer, more autonomous, more likely themselves to become servants?&quot;

When leaders shift their mindset and serve first, they benefit as well as their employees in that their employees acquire personal growth, while the organization grows as well due to the employees&#x27; growing commitment and engagement. Since this leadership style came about, a number of different organizations including Starbucks and Marriott International have adopted this style as their way of leadership.

According to a 2002 study by Sen Sendjaya and James C. Sarros, servant leadership is being practiced in some of the top-ranking companies, and these companies are highly ranked because of their leadership style and following. Further research also confirms that servant leaders lead others to go beyond the call of duty.

== History ==
Before the modern popularity of the concept of &quot;leadership&quot;, the autocratic enlightened absolutist King Frederick II (&quot;the Great&quot;) of Prussia () famously portrayed himself as &quot;the first servant of the state&quot;.

The roots of the concept can be seen in much earlier texts. For instance, the Bible contains the following teaching of Jesus Christ:

Robert K. Greenleaf first popularized the phrase &quot;servant leadership&quot; in &quot;The Servant as Leader&quot;, an essay published in 1970. In this essay, Greenleaf explains how and why he came up with the idea of servant leadership, as well as defining a servant leader. Greenleaf gave this idea an extensive amount of thought before bringing it to life. Larry Spears, CEO of the Greenleaf Center for Servant Leadership, stated in an interview:

&quot;Greenleaf credited his reading of Hesse&#x27;s 1932 book, &quot;Journey to the East&quot;, as the personal source of inspiration in his coining the term, &#x27;servant-leader&#x27; in his 1970 essay, The Servant as Leader.&quot;

In &quot;Journey to the East&quot;, the main character, named Leo, is a servant just like all the others. All the servants work well together, until one day when Leo disappears. When the servants realize that things are not the same without Leo, they came to the realization that Leo was far more than a servant – he was actually their leader.

Greenleaf came to the realization that a newfound leader should be someone that servants or workers can relate to. Leo was seen as a servant, but when the other servants realized that things fell apart without him, he became far more than just a servant to them. This is Greenleaf&#x27;s idea of what a servant leader should be. Greenleaf first put his idea of servant leadership to use in an organizational sense while he was working as an executive at AT&amp;T.

Servant leadership entered the arena of research in 1998 with the publication of the first peer-reviewed servant leadership scale, and since then, over 270 peer-reviewed articles have been published across 122 academic journals. The year 2008 was a significant year in servant leadership research with the publication of two seminal papers by Sen Sendjaya, James C. Sarros, and Joseph C. Santora as well as Liden, Wayne, Zhao, and Henderson, and the first publications using Ehrhart&#x27;s (2004) measure.

== Greenleaf&#x27;s original formulation ==
The most important characteristic in being a servant leader, according to Greenleaf, is making one&#x27;s main priority to serve rather than to lead. According to Ginny Boyum, Greenleaf proposed that servant leaders should serve first, make the needs of others their main priority, and find success and &quot;power&quot; in the growth of others; summarily, &quot;A servant can only become a leader if a leader remains a servant&quot;. In simpler terms, servant leaders should seek to be servants first, to care for the needs of all others around them, to ensure growth of future leaders. These traits indicate one is a servant leader because, overall, they are causing the ones they serve to become healthier and wiser, guiding others toward self-improvement. Eventually, the served are driven to possess the traits of a servant leader as well, continuing the spread of the leadership style.

Greenleaf believed the betterment of others to be the true intention of a servant leader: &quot;I serve&quot; in opposition of the traditional &quot;I lead&quot; mentality. The &quot;I serve&quot; mentality is evident in politicians who define their role through public service. From the &quot;I serve&quot; mentality come two premises:
* I serve because I am the leader, and
* I am the leader because I serve

The first premise signifies the act of altruism. Altruism is defined as the belief in or practice of disinterested and selfless concern for the well-being of others. Greenleaf declares that servant leadership begins with the natural feeling of wanting to serve first. The act of leadership is in the context of serving others and to serve others. Only through the act of serving does the leader lead other people to be what they are capable of. The second premise of servant leadership (&quot;I am the leader because I serve&quot;) begins with a rooted ambition to be a leader or personal ambitions of a leader.

Greenleaf&#x27;s definition left much room for speculation because it lacks specifics. Servant leadership is handled throughout the literature by many different dimensions. Servant leadership represents a model of leadership that is both inspirational and contains moral safeguards, and in their paper, Mulyadi Robin and Sen Sendjaya proposes that servant leadership serves as a holistic paradigm for leadership as not only is it transformative and ethical, but also engages followers in workplace spirituality.

Despite several conceptual papers on the topic of servant leadership, there is no consensus on empirical research for the servant-leadership construct until a state-of-the-art review published in 2020 by Nathan Eva, Mulyadi Robin, Sen Sendjaya, Dirk van Dierendonck, and Robert C Liden in the &quot;Leadership Quarterly&quot;.

==Formulations after Greenleaf==
=== Scales and servant leadership extensions ===
Numerous different researchers and leadership experts have created scales and dimensions to differentiate between the levels of Servant Leadership practices as well as evaluate Servant Leadership behaviors.
* One major extension was Larry Spears&#x27;s 10 characteristics of the servant leader. Similar to other leadership experts, Spears believed that servant leaders should have these 10 traits: empathy, listening, healing, awareness, persuasion, conceptualization, foresight, stewardship, commitment to the growth of people, and building community. Leadership experts such as Bolman, Deal, Covey, Fullan, Sergiovanni, and Heifitz also reference these characteristics as essential components of effective leadership.
* Likewise, Joe Iarocci, author of &quot;Servant Leadership in the Workplace&quot;, identifies three key priorities (developing people, building a trusting team, achieving results), three key principles (serve first, persuasion, empowerment) and three key practices (listening, delegating, connecting followers to mission) that distinguish servant leadership in the workplace context.
* Researchers Barbuto and Wheeler created a dimension called &quot;the natural desire to serve others&quot;, by combining the 10 characteristics of Spears. These researchers developed operational definitions and scales to measure 11 potential characteristics of servant leadership. Factor analyses reduced this scale to five unique dimensions: altruistic calling (four items), emotional healing (four items), wisdom (five items), persuasive mapping (five items), and organizational stewardship (five items). This framework specified the fundamentals to servant leadership and was consistent with Greenleaf&#x27;s original message. Among these five dimensions, altruistic calling is most aligned with ethics.
* There are also researchers such as Russell and Stone who reviewed the literature and proposed nine &#x27;functional&#x27; attributes of servant leadership (vision, honesty, integrity, trust, service, modeling, pioneering, appreciation of others, and empowerment) and eleven &#x27;accompanying&#x27; attributes (communication, credibility, competence, stewardship, visibility, influence, persuasion, listening, encouragement, teaching, and delegation). They also argued that the servant leader must be a teacher to develop their followers, and that values and core personal beliefs were the antecedents to servant leadership.
* Researcher Patterson also developed a more spiritual conceptualization of servant leadership around leader values including: agapé love, humility, altruism, creating 21 visions for followers, being trusting, serving, and empowering their followers. This work was exploratory in nature. No confirmatory analysis was performed, no criterion was posited to establish validity, and convergent/divergent validity was not established.
* Sendjaya, Eva, Butar-Butar, Robin and Castles&#x27; (2019) six-item composite of the Servant Leadership Behavior Scale (SLBS-6) which uniquely contributes a spiritual dimension, a distinguishing feature that makes servant leadership a truly holistic leadership approach relative to other positive leadership approaches. The inclusion of spirituality faithfully reflects Greenleaf&#x27;s (1977) initial, and Graham&#x27;s (1991) theorizing, that servant leadership relies on spiritual insights and humility as its source of influence.

=== Thoughts on servant leadership and further definitions ===
In addition to some early definitions and distinct characteristics of servant leaders, researchers and leadership experts have used research to add on to these. James Sipe and Don Frick, in their book &quot;The Seven Pillars of Servant Leadership&quot;, state that servant-leaders are individuals of character, those who put people first, are skilled communicators, are compassionate collaborators, use foresight, are systems thinkers, and exercise moral authority. Similarly, researcher Akuchie explored the religious and spiritual articulations of the servant leadership construct. Akuchie examined a single Bible passage related to servant leadership and suggested that the application of this lesson is for daily life. However, Akuchie did not, in any way, clarify servant leadership as distinct from other forms of leadership or articulate a framework for understanding servant leadership.

In their review of the servant leadership literature, Eva, Robin, Sendjaya, van Dierendonk and Liden argued that for research, servant leadership should be defined as &quot;an (1) other-oriented approach to leadership (2) manifested through one-on-one prioritizing of follower individual needs and interests, (3) and outward reorienting of their concern for self towards concern for others within the organization and the larger community.&quot;

The authors proposed three key elements that captures the essence of servant leadership and set it apart from other leadership styles – namely the motive (the underlying personal motivation for taking up a leadership responsibility, requiring a strong sense of self, character, and psychological maturity), the mode (that they lead by prioritizing subordinates&#x27; needs above the organization&#x27;s bottom line), and the mindset (that servant leaders are stewards who reorient their followers&#x27; focus towards others). In essence, servant leadership comprises the following: (1) someone or something other than the leader, (2) one-on-one interactions between leaders and followers, and (3) an overarching concern towards the wellbeing of the wider organizational stakeholders and the larger community.

The appeal or, or preference to engage in, servant leadership may be influenced by leaders&#x27; personalities. The altruistic-nurturing personality type, as measured by the Strength Deployment Inventory show a strong positive correlation with servant leadership at 0.708. While leaders with different types showed correlations with other leadership styles. The assertive-directing type correlated with transformational leadership, analytic-autonomizing leaders correlated with transactional leadership, and those with a flexible-cohering type correlated with situational leadership.

== Critiques of servant leadership ==
===Critiques of Greenleaf===
Various critiques of servant leadership have been made. In one such critique, Sendjaya and Sarros used the same Bible account as Akuchie, and made the claim that Jesus Christ, not Greenleaf, introduced the notion of servant leadership to everyday human endeavor. They argued that this leadership principle was so important to Christianity that it was captured by all four Gospel writers (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John). The researchers argued that servant leaders have a particular view of themselves as stewards who are entrusted to develop and empower followers to reach their fullest potential. However, Sendjaya and Sarros research work did not propose a testable framework nor did this work distinguish between this and other leadership styles.

Feminist scholars have noted that servant leadership is based on patriarchal approaches to leadership, noting that leadership discourse in general is attributed with masculinity. Similarly, Black scholars have pointed out how notions of servants as being subjugated and mistreated is largely absent from servant leadership discourse. Black scholars also note that although Greenleaf attributes his ideas to Hermann Hesse, Martin Luther King Jr. preached similar approaches and was a contemporary of Greenleaf in the United States, but King is never mentioned in any of Greenleaf&#x27;s original works.

=== Critiques of the approach ===

Researchers Farling, Stone, and Winston noted the lack of empirical evidence for servant leadership. The researchers presented servant leadership as a hierarchical model in a cyclical process. This consisted of behavioral (vision, service) and relational (influence, credibility, trust) components. However, this conceptualization made by these researchers did not differ from leadership theories such as transformational leadership. Researcher Polleys distinguished servant leadership from three predominant leadership paradigms: The Trait, Behavioral, and Contingency approaches to leadership. Polleys&#x27;s views aligned with transforming leadership but, once again, made no distinctions among charismatic, transformational, and servant leadership.

Risks and limitations of servant leadership with regard to ethical questions

In the leadership literature, servant leadership is often presented as a particularly ethical leadership style.
A 2021 paper published in the &quot;Journal of Management History&quot; explained why servant leadership poses a number of risks and limitations, particularly with regard to ethical issues and dilemmas. The researchers identified four main risks:
# The risk that the servant leader may have too narrow an understanding of &quot;service&quot;.
# Servant leadership&#x27;s ambiguity about morality/the moral content.
# The fact that servant leadership &quot;relies on the moral framework&quot; of the followers.
# The risk that servant leadership without the leader&#x27;s motivation to serve will remain &quot;up in the air&quot;, i.e., &quot;detached from a clearly defined moral compass&quot;.

== Experimental research and theory ==

=== Theoretical foundations ===
Servant leadership predominately draws on two social theories to explain how it influences follower behavior: social learning and social exchange theory. In servant leadership literature, the use of social learning theory argues that servant leaders are influencing their followers, as their followers observe and emulate the leader&#x27;s positive behaviors. In contrast, social exchange theory is used to argue that a servant leader&#x27;s followers are exhibiting positive behaviors due to the reciprocal relationship they develop with their leader.

=== Employee organization commitment ===
While organizations thrive based on the work produced by the employees, the commitment of the employees to the organization is a major contributor to how well an organization functions. Research shows that management style is a main factor in sales person turnover. When put into practice, servant leadership has a positive effect on a salesperson&#x27;s turnover intentions because turnover is mainly associated with &quot;the quality of the salesperson–supervisor relationship.&quot; Due to servant leaders making their employees their main priority and placing their well-being above everything else, including the organization, the employees feel a sense of trust and a need to return the commitment and obligation that their employer has for them to the organization. Likewise, servant leadership has a direct effect on employer brand perception, which in turn reduces employee job turnover. According to Kashyap and Rangnekar, servant leadership molds organizations and builds a positive image for the organization. This leads to turnover intention reduction in that the employees &quot;... take pride in what they do and enjoy the company of people they work with&quot;. Servant leaders are also seen as good role models in the eyes of their employees. Because of this, employees begin to act as servant leaders themselves, and portray great commitment to the organizations where they see these behaviors and how they affect others around them. The employees also stay at the organization so that they can see and learn more from their employer.

=== Employee life ===
Servant leadership practices appear to have an effect on the life of the employee, outside of the organizations that they are affiliated with. It has been concluded that employee perceptions of servant leadership practices and the support of employers and co-workers has a positive effect on an employee&#x27;s family life. Having their employer cater to their needs, in conjunction with supportive co-workers and staff, aids in lowering stress levels, which produces the desire to go home and cater to their family&#x27;s needs. In addition, servant leadership being the foundation of organizations is said to lead to employees having positive experiences and satisfaction in the work place, which in turn leads to &quot;a transfer of positive experiences from the work role to the family role&quot;. Servant leadership being practiced is said to decrease emotional exhaustion, which is the leading cause of employee burnout. Servant leadership lessens the feeling of being &quot;drained of inner resources&quot;, so employees experience an increase in work-to-family positive spillover (WFPS). This decreased emotional exhaustion also leads to stronger marital relationships. Moreover, employees feeling that their needs are made a priority in the workplace, as well as the feeling of being satisfied with their interactions at work on a daily basis, has an impact on their family&#x27;s experience with them as they shift from the work role to the family role.

=== Job performance ===
Servant leadership also contributes to employees&#x27; goal achievement and success. As defined before, a servant leader&#x27;s goal is to build upon the skills of their employees and make them better people. With this trait, studies have shown that servant leaders have the ability to influence their employees to achieve their own goals as well as their work goals due to their leaders empowerment, and this plays a major role in their continued success and growth. This outcome is expected because the servant leader&#x27;s main concern is the well-being of their employees. Likewise, servant leaders managing the work environment and things such as &quot;rewards, deadlines, work allocation and performance evaluations&quot; has a positive effect on the well-being and satisfaction of employees because the practices of a servant leader deals with these aspects in a way that benefits the employees in every way possible. Studies have also shown that leadership as a whole has an effect on employees&#x27; psychological health. Studies have shown this in that the less strain on the employee and the more they assimilate at the organization, the better their psychological health. Research has shown that though many organizations believe that the &quot;top-down&quot; way, or the leader prioritizing themselves and the organization and then the employees, is the best way to engage employees in their work, servant leadership&#x27;s &quot;bottom-up&quot; style, or prioritizing the needs of the employees first, causes employees to be more engaged in their work in that they feel that they have social support from their leader as well as their colleagues. Overall, employees feeling a sense of support, as well as having a leader who does everything in their power to do things that are beneficial for the employees, contributes to heightened employee job performance.

===Community citizenship behavior===
Similar to servant leadership having an effect on employees&#x27; stress levels, it also affects them emotionally as well. According to previous research, servant leadership seems to have an effect on the emotional health of the employees because the servant leaders&#x27; reliance on &quot;one-on-one communication to understand the abilities, needs, desires, goals, and potential of those individuals&quot; aids in the employees&#x27; ability to express themselves in the workplace. In turn, this nurturing leads to them returning the same nurturing towards their co-workers and making the workplace a suitable environment for employee growth, as well as the production of good quality work to grow the organization. Organizations that do not practice servant leadership may discourage employees expressing their feelings in the workplace; however, servant leaders encourage this expression in order to prevent conflict. Servant leaders also make a safe emotional work environment for employees by making acceptance a major goal. Acceptance refers to having different personalities, personal views, and values as employees, and understanding that employees are not perfect. They also create a psychologically ethical climate. By doing this, servant leaders create a safe space where employees are able to be themselves and express their feelings, knowing that they can trust their leader to be non-judgmental. Lastly, servant leaders are able to manage employees&#x27; behaviors by being forgiving. Some employees may have personalities and/or characteristics that may lead to them doing or saying things to their leader that are unacceptable. However, servant leaders&#x27; being forgiving, and more importantly understanding, leads to employees being able to learn from their mistakes, hence their personal growth and changed behavior within the organization.

== Implications ==
Some argue that servant leadership is still going through the process of being accepted as a leadership theory because of Greenleaf&#x27;s belief that servant leadership is a way of life rather than a systematized technique with a specific outline. Although servant leadership was proposed many years ago, it is still considered a &quot;newer&quot; theory among many other theories because of the switch in focus from the traditional leadership theories.

However, as demonstrated by Eva, Robin, Sendjaya, van Dierendonck, and Liden&#x27;s review, research has established servant leadership as a valid construct that is worthwhile researching and implementing. The authors state:

<text>Sir George Houston Reid (25 February 1845 – 12 September 1918) was a Scottish-born Australian and British politician, diplomat, and barrister who served as the fourth prime minister of Australia from 1904 to 1905. He held office as the leader of the Free Trade Party, previously serving as the 12th premier of New South Wales from 1894 to 1899, and later as the high commissioner of Australia to the United Kingdom from 1910 to 1916.

Reid was born in Johnstone, Renfrewshire, Scotland. He and his family immigrated to Australia when he was young. They initially settled in Melbourne, but moved to Sydney when Reid was 13, at which point he left school and began working as a clerk. He later joined the New South Wales civil service, and rose through the ranks to become secretary of the Attorney-General&#x27;s Department. Reid was also something of a public intellectual, publishing several works in defence of liberalism and free trade. He began studying law in 1876 and was admitted to the bar in 1879. In 1880, he resigned from the civil service to run for parliament, winning election to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly.

From 1883 to 1884, Reid was Minister of Public Instruction in the government of Alexander Stuart. He joined the Free Trade Party of Henry Parkes in 1887, but refused to serve in Parkes&#x27; governments due to personal enmity. When Parkes resigned as party leader in 1891, Reid was elected in his place. He became premier after the 1894 election and remained in office for just over five years. Despite never winning majority government, Reid was able to pass a number of domestic reforms concerning the civil service and public finances. He was an advocate of federation and played a part in drafting the Constitution of Australia, where he became known as a strong defender of his colony&#x27;s interests. In 1901, he was elected to the new Federal Parliament representing the Division of East Sydney.

Reid retained the leadership of the Free Trade and Liberal Association after federation, and consequently became Australia&#x27;s first Leader of the Opposition. For the first few years, the Protectionist Party governed with the support of the Australian Labor Party. Alfred Deakin&#x27;s Protectionist minority government collapsed in April 1904, and he was briefly succeeded by Labor&#x27;s Chris Watson, who proved unable to govern and resigned after four months. As a result, Reid became prime minister in August 1904, heading yet another minority government. He included four Protectionists in his cabinet, but was unable to achieve much before his government was brought down in July 1905. One notable exception was the passage of the landmark Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904, which dealt with industrial relations.

At the 1906 election, Reid secured the most votes in the Australian House of Representatives and the equal-most seats, but was well short of a majority and could not form a government. He resigned as party leader in 1908, after opposing the formation of the Commonwealth Liberal Party (a merger with the Protectionists). Reid accepted an appointment as Australia&#x27;s first High Commissioner to the United Kingdom in 1910, and remained in the position until 1916. He subsequently won election to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, serving until his sudden death two years later.

==Early life==
Reid was born on 25 February 1845 in Johnstone, Renfrewshire, Scotland. He was the fifth of seven children born to Marion (née Crybbace) and John Reid; he had four older brothers and two younger sisters. He was named after George Houstoun, a former Conservative MP for the Renfrewshire constituency who had died a few years earlier. Reid&#x27;s father, the son of a farmer, was born in Tarbolton, Ayrshire. At the time of George&#x27;s birth, he was a minister in the Church of Scotland, which he had joined in 1839 after previously ministering in various secessionist Presbyterian churches; he remained loyal to the established church in the Disruption of 1843. In 1834, he had married the daughter of another minister, Edward Crybbace; she was about nine years his junior.

In April 1845, Reid and his family moved to Liverpool, England, where his father had been appointed minister of an expatriate Presbyterian congregation. His two younger sisters were born there. The family struggled financially, and his father made the decision to emigrate to Australia. Reid arrived in Melbourne in May 1852, and his father subsequently led congregations in Essendon and North Melbourne. He moved the family to Sydney in 1858. Reid received his only formal schooling at the Melbourne Academy, now known as Scotch College. He received a classical education, and in later life recalled that he had &quot;no appetite for that wide range of metaphysical propositions which juveniles were expected to comprehend&quot;; he found Greek a &quot;lazy horror&quot;. He left school aged about 13, when the family settled in Sydney, and began working as a junior clerk in a merchant&#x27;s counting house. At the age of 15, he joined the debating society at the Sydney Mechanics&#x27; School of Arts, and according to his autobiography, &quot;a more crude novice than he had never begun the practise of public speaking&quot;. In Sydney, Reid&#x27;s father became a colleague of John Dunmore Lang at the Scots Church, and then from 1862 until his death in 1867 was the minister of the Mariners&#x27; Church on George Street. His mother, who died in 1885, was involved in the ragged schools movement. In later life, Reid praised his parents for his good upbringing.

==Public service career==
In 1864, Reid joined the New South Wales Civil Service as an assistant accountant in the Colonial Treasury, with an annual salary of £200. He was promoted to clerk of correspondence and contracts in 1868, and then chief clerk of correspondence in 1874 on a salary of £400. In 1876, he began to study law seriously, which would provide the independent income necessary to pursue a parliamentary career (given that parliamentary service was unpaid at the time). He became head of the Attorney-General&#x27;s Department in 1878. In 1879, Reid qualified as a barrister. He made a name for himself by publishing pamphlets on topical issues. In 1875, he published his &quot;Five Essays on Free Trade&quot;, which brought him an honorary membership of the Cobden Club, and in 1878 the government published his &quot;New South Wales, the Mother Colony of the Australians&quot;, for distribution in Europe.

==Political career==
Reid&#x27;s career was aided by his quick wit and entertaining oratory; he was described as being &quot;perhaps the best platform speaker in the Empire&quot;, both amusing and informing his audiences &quot;who flocked to his election meetings as to popular entertainment&quot;. In one particular incident his quick wit and affinity for humour were demonstrated when a heckler pointed to his ample paunch and exclaimed &quot;What are you going to call it, George?&quot; to which Reid replied: &quot;If it&#x27;s a boy, I&#x27;ll call it after myself. If it&#x27;s a girl I&#x27;ll call it Victoria. But if, as I strongly suspect, it&#x27;s nothing but piss and wind, I&#x27;ll name it after you.&quot; His humour, however, was not universally appreciated. Alfred Deakin detested Reid, describing him as &quot;inordinately vain and resolutely selfish&quot; and their cold relationship would affect both their later careers.

Reid was elected top of the poll to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as a member for the four-member electoral district of East Sydney in the 1880 New South Wales colonial election. He was not very active at first, as he was building up his legal practice, although he was concerned to reform the Robertson Land Acts, which had not prevented 96 land holders from controlling eight million acres (32,000 km2) between them. Henry Parkes and John Robertson attempted to make minor amendments to the land acts but were defeated and at the subsequent election Parkes&#x27; party lost many seats.

The new premier, Alexander Stuart, offered Reid the position of Colonial Treasurer in January 1883, but he thought it wiser to accept the junior office of Minister of Public Instruction. He served 14 months in this office and succeeded in passing a much improved Education Act, which included the establishment of the first government high schools in the leading towns, technical schools (which became a model for the other colonies) and the provision of evening lectures at the university.

In February 1884, Reid lost his seat in parliament owing to a technicality; The Elections and Qualifications Committee held that the Governor had already issued five proclamations prior to the appointment of Francis Suttor to the office of Minister of Public Instruction thus both Suttor and his successor Reid were incapable of being validly appointed. At the resulting by-election Reid was defeated by a small majority as a result of the government&#x27;s financial hardships due to the loss of revenue from the suspension of land sales. In 1885, he was re-elected in East Sydney and took a great part in the free trade or protection issue. He supported Sir Henry Parkes on the free trade side but, when Parkes came into power in 1887, declined a seat in his ministry. Parkes offered him a portfolio two years later and Reid again refused. He did not like Parkes personally and felt he would be unable to work with him. When payment of members of parliament was passed, Reid, who had always opposed it, paid the amount of his salary into the treasury. Reid had become one of Sydney&#x27;s leading barristers by impressing juries by his cross-examinations and was made a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1898. In May 1891 four free traders, Reid, Jack Want, John Haynes and Jonathan Seaver, voted against the Fifth Parkes ministry in a motion of no confidence, which was only defeated by the casting vote of the Speaker of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. Whilst the government survived the motion, parliament was dissolved on 6 June 1891.

==Premier==

In September 1891, the Parkes ministry was defeated, the Dibbs government succeeded it, and Parkes retired from the leadership of the Free Trade Party. Reid was elected leader of the opposition in his place. In 1891, he married Florence (Flora) Ann Brumby, who was 23 years old to his 46. He managed to form his party into a coherent group although it &quot;ran the whole gamut from conservative Sydney merchants through middle-class intellectuals to reformers who wished to replace indirect by direct taxation for social reasons.&quot;

At the 1894 election Reid made the establishment of a real free trade tariff with a system of direct taxation the main item of his policy, and had a great victory. Edmund Barton and other well-known protectionists lost their seats, Labor was reduced from 30 to 18, and Reid formed his first cabinet. One of his earliest measures was a new lands bill which provided for the division of pastoral leases into two-halves, one of which was to be open to the free selector, while the pastoral lessee got some security of tenure for the other half. Classification of crown lands according to their value was provided for, and the free selector, or his transferee, had to reside on the property.

At an early stage of the session, Parkes pressed the question of federation, and in response Reid invited the premiers of the other colonies to meet in conference on 29 January 1895. This resolved in favour of an elected Australasian Federal Convention, that would draw up a federal constitution, which would then to be subject of a referendum in each colony. Meanwhile, Reid had great trouble in passing his land and income tax bills. When he did get them through the Assembly the New South Wales Legislative Council threw them out. Reid obtained a dissolution, was victorious at the polls, and heavily defeated Parkes for the new single-member electoral district of Sydney-King. He eventually succeeded in passing his acts, which were moderate, but was strenuously opposed by the council, and it was only the fear that the chamber might be swamped with new appointments that eventually wore down the opposition. Reid was also successful in bringing in reforms in the keeping of public accounts and in the civil service generally. Other acts dealt with the control of inland waters, and much needed legislation relating to public health, factories, and mining, was also passed. In five years he achieved more than any of his predecessors.

On four occasions between December 1895 and May 1899 Reid was temporarily appointed to the vacant position of Solicitor General for New South Wales to allow him to deputise for the Attorney General of New South Wales, Jack Want, in his absence. Reid took on the position of Attorney-General in addition to being Premier in the last months of his government.

==Federation==

Reid supported the federation of the Australian colonies, but since the campaign was led by his Protectionist opponent Edmund Barton he did not take a leading role. He was dissatisfied by the draft constitution, especially the power of a Senate, elected on the basis of States rather than population, to reject money bills.

Following the Adelaide session in 1897 of the National Australasian Convention, Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain sent the Colonial Office&#x27;s extensive and sometimes critical comments on the current draft of the federal constitution to Reid (then in London for Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee), for his &quot;private &amp; independent&quot; consideration. At the Sydney and Melbourne sessions of the Convention in 1897 and 1898, Reid moved amendments based on those comments, covertly obtaining several concessions to British wishes. He denied a suggestion that he had been &quot;talking with ‘Joe’&quot;. Reid did copy Chamberlain&#x27;s comments to a select few other delegates, but they never revealed this. They included Edmund Barton, chair of the Drafting Committee, which accommodated some of Chamberlain&#x27;s more technical points.

In the aftermath of the Convention, Reid made his famous &quot;Yes-No&quot; speech at Sydney Town Hall, on 28 March 1898. He told his audience that he intended to deal with the bill &quot;with the deliberate impartiality of a judge addressing a jury&quot;. After speaking for an hour and three-quarters the audience was still uncertain about his verdict. He concluded by declaring &quot;my duty to Australia demands me to record my vote in favour of the bill&quot;. Barton congratulated him on stage, but later he and other Federationists were frustrated by Reid saying that, while he felt he could not desert the cause, he would not recommend any course to the electors: &quot;Now, I say to you, having pointed out my mind, and having shown you the dark places as well as the light places of this constitution, I hope every man in this country, without coercion from me, without any interference from me, will judge for himself.&quot; He consistently kept this attitude until the poll was taken on 3 June 1898. This earned him the nickname &quot;Yes-No Reid&quot;. The referendum in New South Wales resulted in a small majority in favour, but the yes votes fell about 8000 short of the required 80,000. Subsequently, Reid was able to secure greater concessions for New South Wales.
At the general election held soon after, Barton challenged Reid in the premier&#x27;s seat of Sydney-King. Reid was re-elected, receiving 761 votes to Barton&#x27;s 651, but his party came back with a reduced majority. Reid fought for federation at the second referendum and it was carried in New South Wales, with 56.5 percent of valid votes cast for &#x27;Yes&#x27;. &quot;A bizarre combination of the Labor Party, protectionists, Federation enthusiasts and die-hard anti-Federation free traders&quot; censured Reid for paying the expenses of John Neild who had been commissioned to report on old-age pensions, prior to parliamentary approval. Governor Beauchamp refused Reid a dissolution of parliament, and Reid was defeated in a no confidence motion, 75 to 41, in September 1899. By this time Reid had grown extremely overweight and sported a walrus moustache and a monocle, but his buffoonish image concealed a shrewd political brain.

==Federal politics==

===Leader of the Opposition (1901–1904)===
Reid was elected to the first federal Parliament as the Member for the Division of East Sydney at the 1901 Australian federal election. The Free Trade Party won 28 out of 75 seats in the Australian House of Representatives, and 17 out of 36 seats in the Australian Senate. Labor no longer trusted Reid and gave their support to the Edmund Barton Protectionist Party government, so Reid became the first Leader of the Opposition, a position well-suited to his robust debating style and rollicking sense of humour. In the long tariff debate Reid was at a disadvantage as parliament was sitting in Melbourne and he could not entirely neglect his practice as a barrister in Sydney, as his parliamentary income was less than a tenth of his income from his legal practice. In their old stronghold of New South Wales free traders had won 12 seats, but Labor won six, and the old compact between Labor and Reid was a thing of the past.

On 18 August 1903, Reid resigned (the first member of the House of Representatives to do so) and challenged the government to oppose his re-election on the issue of its refusal to accept a system of equal electoral districts. On 4 September he successfully contested the 1903 East Sydney by-election against a Labor opponent. He was the only person in Australian federal parliamentary history to win back his seat at a by-election triggered by his own resignation, until John Alexander in 2017.

Alfred Deakin took over from Barton as prime minister and leader of the Protectionists. At the 1903 election, the Free Trade Party won 24 seats, with the Labor vote increasing mainly at the expense of the Protectionists.

===Prime Minister (1904–1905)===

In August 1904, when the Watson government resigned, Reid became prime minister. He was the first former state premier to become Prime Minister (the only other to date being Joseph Lyons). Reid did not have a majority in either House, and he knew it would be only a matter of time before the Protectionists patched up their differences with Labor, so he enjoyed himself in office while he could. In July 1905 the other two parties duly voted him out, and he left office with good grace.

===Leader of the Opposition (1905–1908)===
Reid adopted a strategy of trying to reorient the party system along Labor vs. non-Labor lines – prior to the 1906 election, he renamed his Free Trade Party to the Anti-Socialist Party. Reid envisaged a spectrum running from socialist to anti-socialist, with the Protectionist Party in the middle. This attempt struck a chord with politicians who were steeped in the Westminster tradition and regarded a two-party system as very much the norm. Zachary Gorman has argued that this attempt to impose clear &#x27;lines of cleavage&#x27; in Federal politics was inspired by Reid&#x27;s friend Joseph Carruthers who had achieved a political realignment in New South Wales that destroyed the Progressive middle party and created a Liberal-Labor divide. For Reid, anti-socialism was a natural product of his long-standing belief in Gladstonian liberalism.

Reid referred to Labor publicly using a damaging visual negative image of Labor as a hungry socialist tiger that would devour all. The anti-socialist campaign led to the Protectionist vote and seat count dropping significantly at the 1906 election, while both Reid&#x27;s party and Labor won 26 seats each. The Deakin government continued with Labor support for the time being, despite only holding 16 seats after losing 10, although with another 5 independent Protectionists. Reid&#x27;s anti-socialist campaign had nevertheless laid the groundwork for the desired realignment, and liberalism would come to sit on the centre-right of Australian politics.

In 1907–1908, Reid strenuously resisted Deakin&#x27;s commitment to increase tariff rates. When Deakin proposed the Commonwealth Liberal Party, a &quot;Fusion&quot; of the two non-Labor parties, Reid resigned as party leader on 16 November 1908. The following day, Joseph Cook was made leader until the parties merged.

On 24 December 1909 Reid resigned from Parliament (he was the first Member to have resigned twice), however his seat was left vacant until the 1910 election. His seat of East Sydney was won by Labor&#x27;s John West, in an election which saw Labor win 42 of 75 seats, against the CLP on 31 seats. Labor also won a majority in the Senate.

==Later life and legacy==
In 1910, Reid was appointed as Australia&#x27;s first High Commissioner in London.

Reid was extremely popular in Britain, and in 1916, when his term as High Commissioner ended, he was elected unopposed to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom for the seat of St George, Hanover Square as a Unionist candidate, where he acted as a spokesman for the self-governing Dominions in supporting the war effort. He died suddenly in London on 12 September 1918, aged 73, of cerebral thrombosis, survived by his wife and their two sons and daughter. His wife had become Dame Flora Reid GBE in 1917. He is buried in Putney Vale Cemetery.

Reid&#x27;s posthumous reputation suffered from the general acceptance of protectionist policies by other parties, as well as from his buffoonish public image. In 1989 W. G. McMinn published &quot;George Reid&quot;, a serious biography designed to rescue Reid from his reputation as a clownish reactionary and attempt to show his Free Trade policies as having been vindicated by history.

==Honours==

In 1897 Reid was made an Honorary Doctor of Civil Law (DCL) by Oxford University. Reid was also appointed a member of His Majesty&#x27;s Most Honourable Privy Council (1904), a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (1911) and a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (1916).

One of the oldest suburbs within Canberra, the suburb of Reid, was named after George Reid.

The federal electoral Division of Reid, created in 1922, in Western Sydney bears his name.

In 1969 he was honoured on a postage stamp bearing his portrait issued by Australia Post.

=== Prehistoric ===

The area of Wels has been settled since the Neolithic era (between 3500 and 1700 B.C.E.), as evidenced by archaeological finds of simple tools, especially from around the banks of the Traun River in what is now the city center.

A Bronze Age (after 1700 B.C.E.) cemetery was found in the area of the current airport and dated to the time of the Urnfield Culture (1100–750 B.C.E.). It contained 60 graves with such items as bronze jewelry and food.

Swords from the Halstatt Period (750–400 B.C.E.) have been found in the area of Pernau.

During the Iron Age La Tène Culture (up to 100 B.C.E.) Celts inhabited the area, leaving behind gold coins, swords, earthenware and iron brooches. The name &quot;Traun&quot; comes from this time, and it is possible that &quot;Wels&quot; is similarly of Celtic origin. The name &quot;Wels&quot; could be Celtic for &quot;Settlement on the bend of the Traun River&quot;.

===Roman Era===
Wels gained importance in Roman times because of its central location in the province of Noricum. Around the year 120, Wels received Roman city rights under the name of &quot;Municipium Ovilava&quot;. The enclosed built-up area by the Traun River was at the present level of Kaiser-Josef-Platz. There were brick houses, a bath, an arena and an irrigation system of pure mountain water brought from beyond the Traun.

Around 215, during the reign of Emperor Caracalla, it was renamed &quot;Colonia Aurelia Antoniana Ovilabis&quot; and given &quot;Colonia&quot; status. At this time, the city had around 18,000 inhabitants.

Due to the impending threat of the Alemanni, the city was surrounded by a city wall that enclosed an area of about 90 hectares and a road was built along the Danube to Passau. It is known that six towers with gates were integrated into the walls, controlling entrances from along the western road, towards the Traun, and to the fields beyond the city.

As part of his reforms Emperor Diocletian made Ovilava the capital city of the province of &quot;Noricum Ripensis&quot;. It was governed by two &quot;duumviri&quot; who served as municipal judges, two &quot;aediles&quot;, who advocated compliance with the laws and market rights, a &quot;quaestor&quot;, who managed the city treasury, and a 100-member city council.

Ovilava administered an area enclosed by the Inn and Danube, from Lauriacum (Enns) in the east to submitted to Bad Ischl in the west. In this area are included the border fortifications, Linz (Lentia) and Passau (Boiodurum), as well as numerous settlements in what are now the regions of Upper Austria and Salzburg.

During the early migration period (3rd, 4th and 5th century), the area around Ovilava was often invaded by the Alamanni, Vandals and other Germanic tribes as well as by Attila&#x27;s army. During the time of the Emperor Gallienus the province of Noricum was described as “devastated”. By the time of Odoacer, the first Germanic King of Italy, Noricum was described as “vacant”. From the 4th century onward, it is likely that Wels was again a small and insignificant village for several centuries.

====The economy of Roman Wels====

Agriculture and regional trade formed the basis for the economy of Ovilava. While most agriculture was subsistence level, cows and horses were produced in large enough numbers to be exported. The oldest granary in the Eastern Alps has been discovered in Wels, which housed diverse grains such as wheat, dwarf wheat, emmer wheat, barley and rye. There were additionally significant brick and pottery works as well as mines for construction stone.

Due to its situation at an important crossing of several Roman roads, both east-to-west and to the south, archeology reveals a large number of objects manufactured in other areas of the empire, such as Terra Sigillata pottery and statuettes (such as the &quot;Venus of Wels&quot;) from Gaul and Germania Inferior, as well as oyster shells and coins from Italy.

===Middle Ages===

Wels served as a minor trading centre during the Middle Ages. In 943, the Hungarians were defeated by the Bavarians and Carantanians at the Battle of Wels. In 1222, during the rule of the Babenberger family, Wels again received city rights. A document dating to 1328 provides evidence for Wels&#x27; important role as the location of a market. Its endowment with economic privileges, and its advantageous position on several rivers allowed it to gain an important position in the region.

Emperor Maximilian I died in Wels on January 12, 1519, after having been denied access to Innsbruck by its citizens.

===20th century===
During World War II, a subcamp of Mauthausen concentration camp was located here.

On 18 January 1964, Wels became a Statutarstadt of Austria.

==Economy==
There are about 36,000 people employed in Wels. Of that, about 63% are in the service sector. Wels is known as an important city for shopping and the location of several gymnasiums (academic secondary schools) and higher vocational schools and also of a vocational college. Furthermore, it is famous for the Wels Fair, which takes place every year in autumn and spring.

<text>Eulipotyphla (, from &quot;eu-&quot; + &quot;Lipotyphla&quot;, meaning truly lacking blind gut; sometimes called true insectivores) is an order of mammals comprising the Erinaceidae (hedgehogs and gymnures); Solenodontidae (solenodons); Talpidae (moles, shrew-like moles and desmans); and Soricidae (true shrews) families.

== Taxonomic history ==
Historically, these animals were grouped with others such as treeshrews, elephant shrews, and colugos, under the broader category Insectivora, comprising all small insect-eating placental mammals. Wilhelm Peters identified two sub-groups of Insectivora, distinguished by the presence or absence of a cecum in the large intestine. In his 1866 &quot;Generelle morphologie der organismen&quot;, Ernst Haeckel named these groups Menotyphla and Lipotyphla, respectively from &quot;μένω&quot; (&quot;remain&quot;)/&quot;λείπω&quot; (&quot;lack&quot; or &quot;leave behind&quot;) + &quot;τυφλὸν&quot; literally &quot;blind&quot;, as in &quot;τυφλὸν ἔντερον&quot; (&quot;blind intestine&quot;, from which the Latin &quot;intestinum caecum&quot; derives as a calque).

Since the late 1990s, molecular studies have produced evidence that the Lipotyphla are not a monophyletic group. This led to tenrecs, otter shrews, and golden moles being placed a new order (Afrosoricida, in the superorder Afrotheria), with the remaining members of Lipotyphla being reclassified as Eulipotyphla.

A 2023 study suggested that the order began to diversify prior to the K-Pg extinction, based on molecular clock estimates.

== Classification ==


* Order Eulipotyphla (= &#x27;Lipotyphla&#x27; - Afrosoricida = &#x27;Erinaceomorpha&#x27; + &#x27;Soricomorpha&#x27;)
** Family Erinaceidae
*** Subfamily Erinaceinae: hedgehogs
*** Subfamily Galericinae: gymnures or moonrats
** Family Soricidae
*** Subfamily Crocidurinae: white-toothed shrews
*** Subfamily Soricinae: red-toothed shrews
*** Subfamily Myosoricinae: African white-toothed shrews
** Family Talpidae
*** Subfamily Talpinae: Old World moles and desmans
*** Subfamily Scalopinae: New World moles
*** Subfamily Uropsilinae: shrew-like moles
** Family Solenodontidae: solenodons
**† Family Nesophontidae: extinct West Indian shrews
**† Family Amphilemuridae
**† Family Nyctitheriidae
**† Family Plesiosoricidae
Family-level cladogram of modern eulipotyphlan relationships, following Roca et al. and Brace et al.:

The upper and lower basal subclades within the tree are the suborders Solenodonota and Erinaceota, respectively. These two branches are estimated to have split ~72–74 million years (Ma) ago. The Nesophontidae and Solenodontidae are thought to have separated roughly 57 Ma ago. Split times for talpids vs. soricids plus erinaceids, and for soricids vs. erinaceids, have been estimated at 69 Ma and 64 Ma ago, respectively.

<text>In the field of management, strategic management involves the formulation and implementation of the major goals and initiatives taken by an organization&#x27;s managers on behalf of stakeholders, based on consideration of resources and an assessment of the internal and external environments in which the organization operates. Strategic management provides overall direction to an enterprise and involves specifying the organization&#x27;s objectives, developing policies and plans to achieve those objectives, and then allocating resources to implement the plans. Academics and practicing managers have developed numerous models and frameworks to assist in strategic decision-making in the context of complex environments and competitive dynamics. Strategic management is not static in nature; the models can include a feedback loop to monitor execution and to inform the next round of planning.

Michael Porter identifies three principles underlying strategy:

* creating a &quot;unique and valuable [market] position&quot;
* making trade-offs by choosing &quot;what not to do&quot;
* creating &quot;fit&quot; by aligning company activities with one another to support the chosen strategy

Corporate strategy involves answering a key question from a portfolio perspective: &quot;What business should we be in?&quot; Business strategy involves answering the question: &quot;How shall we compete in this business?&quot; Alternatively, corporate strategy may be thought of as the strategic management of a corporation (a particular legal structure of a business), and business strategy as the strategic management of a business.

Management theory and practice often make a distinction between &quot;strategic management&quot; and &quot;operational management&quot;, where operational management is concerned primarily with improving efficiency and controlling costs within the boundaries set by the organization&#x27;s strategy.

==Definitions==
In 1988, Henry Mintzberg described the many different definitions and perspectives on strategy reflected in both academic research and in practice. He examined the strategic process and concluded it was much more fluid and unpredictable than people had thought. Because of this, he could not point to one process that could be called strategic planning. Instead Mintzberg concludes that there are five types of strategies:
* Strategy as plan – a directed course of action to achieve an &quot;intended&quot; set of goals; similar to the strategic planning concept;
* Strategy as pattern – a consistent pattern of past behavior, with a strategy &quot;realized&quot; over time rather than planned or &quot;intended&quot;. Where the realized pattern was different from the intent, he referred to the strategy as &quot;emergent&quot;;
* Strategy as position – locating brands, products, or companies within the market, based on the conceptual framework of consumers or other stakeholders; a strategy determined primarily by factors outside the firm;
* Strategy as ploy – a specific maneuver intended to outwit a competitor; and
* Strategy as perspective – executing strategy based on a &quot;theory of the business&quot; or natural extension of the mindset or ideological perspective of the organization.

In 1998, Mintzberg developed these five types of management strategy into 10 &quot;schools of thought&quot; and grouped them into three categories. The first group is normative. It consists of the schools of informal design and conception, the formal planning, and analytical positioning. The second group, consisting of six schools, is more concerned with how strategic management is actually done, rather than prescribing optimal plans or positions. The six schools are entrepreneurial, visionary, cognitive, learning/adaptive/emergent, negotiation, corporate culture and business environment. The third and final group consists of one school, the configuration or transformation school, a hybrid of the other schools organized into stages, organizational life cycles, or &quot;episodes&quot;.

Michael Porter defined strategy in 1980 as the &quot;...broad formula for how a business is going to compete, what its goals should be, and what policies will be needed to carry out those goals&quot; and the &quot;...combination of the &quot;ends&quot; (goals) for which the firm is striving and the &quot;means&quot; (policies) by which it is seeking to get there.&quot; He continued that: &quot;The essence of formulating competitive strategy is relating a company to its environment.&quot;

Some complexity theorists define strategy as the unfolding of the internal and external aspects of the organization that results in actions in a socio-economic context.

Michael D. Watkins (2007) argued that strategic management operates as a critical bridge between an organization&#x27;s mission, vision, and execution. He asserted that if the mission statement and goals answer the &#x27;what&#x27; question, and if the vision statement answers the &#x27;why&#x27; questions, then strategy provides answers to the &#x27;how&#x27; question of business management. In other words, strategy encompasses the methods, frameworks, and decision-making processes that enable a company to translate its aspirations into concrete actions and competitive success.

==Application==
Strategy is defined as &quot;the determination of the basic long-term goals of an enterprise, and the adoption of courses of action and the allocation of resources necessary for carrying out these goals&quot;. Strategies are established to set direction, focus effort, define or clarify the organization, and provide consistency or guidance in response to the environment.

Strategic management involves the related concepts of strategic planning and strategic thinking. Strategic planning is analytical in nature and refers to formalized procedures to produce the data and analyses used as inputs for strategic thinking, which synthesizes the data resulting in the strategy. Strategic planning may also refer to control mechanisms used to implement the strategy once it is determined. In other words, strategic planning happens &quot;around&quot; the strategic thinking or strategy making activity.

Strategic management is often described as involving two major processes: &quot;formulation&quot; and &quot;implementation&quot; of strategy. While described sequentially below, in practice the two processes are iterative and each provides input for the other.

===Formulation===
&quot;Formulation&quot; of strategy involves analyzing the environment in which the organization operates, then making a series of strategic decisions about how the organization will fulfill its mission. Formulation ends with a series of goals or objectives and measures for the organization to pursue. Environmental analysis includes the:
*Remote external environment, including the political, economic, social, technological, legal and environmental landscape (PESTLE);
*Industry environment, such as the competitive behavior of rival organizations, the bargaining power of buyers/customers and suppliers, threats from new entrants to the industry, and the ability of buyers to substitute products (Porter&#x27;s 5 forces); and 
*Internal environment, regarding the strengths and weaknesses of the organization&#x27;s resources (i.e., its people, processes and IT systems).

&quot;Strategic decisions&quot; are based on insight from the environmental assessment and are responses to strategic questions about how the organization will compete, such as:
*What is the organization&#x27;s business?
*Who is the target customer for the organization&#x27;s products and services? 
*Where are the customers and how do they buy? What is considered &quot;value&quot; to the customer?
*Which businesses, products and services should be included or excluded from the portfolio of offerings?
*What is the geographic scope of the business?
*What differentiates the company from its competitors in the eyes of customers and other stakeholders?
*Which resources, skills and capabilities should be developed within the firm?
*What are the important opportunities and risks for the organization?
*How can the firm grow, through both its base business and new business?
*How can the firm generate more value for investors?

The answers to these and many other strategic questions result in the organization&#x27;s strategy and a series of specific short-term and long-term goals or objectives and related measures.

===Implementation===
The second major process of strategic management is &quot;implementation&quot;, which involves decisions regarding how the organization&#x27;s resources (i.e., people, process and IT systems) will be aligned and mobilized towards the objectives. Implementation results in how the organization&#x27;s resources are structured (such as by product or service or geography), leadership arrangements, communication, incentives, and monitoring mechanisms to track progress towards objectives, among others.

Running the day-to-day operations of the business is often referred to as &quot;operations management&quot; or specific terms for key departments or functions, such as &quot;logistics management&quot; or &quot;marketing management,&quot; which take over once strategic management decisions are implemented.

==Historical development==

===Origins===
The strategic management discipline originated in the 1950s and 1960s. Among the numerous early contributors, the most influential were Peter Drucker, Philip Selznick, Alfred Chandler, Igor Ansoff, and Bruce Henderson. The discipline draws from earlier thinking and texts on &#x27;strategy&#x27; dating back thousands of years. Prior to 1960, the term &quot;strategy&quot; was primarily used regarding war and politics, not business. Many companies built strategic planning functions to develop and execute the formulation and implementation processes during the 1960s.

Peter Drucker was a prolific management theorist and author of dozens of management books, with a career spanning five decades. He addressed fundamental strategic questions in a 1954 book &quot;The Practice of Management&quot; writing: &quot;... the first responsibility of top management is to ask the question &#x27;what is our business?&#x27; and to make sure it is carefully studied and correctly answered.&quot; He wrote that the answer was determined by the customer. He recommended eight areas where objectives should be set, such as market standing, innovation, productivity, physical and financial resources, worker performance and attitude, profitability, manager performance and development, and public responsibility.

In 1957, Philip Selznick initially used the term &quot;distinctive competence&quot; in referring to how the Navy was attempting to differentiate itself from the other services. He also formalized the idea of matching the organization&#x27;s internal factors with external environmental circumstances. This core idea was developed further by Kenneth R. Andrews in 1963 into what we now call SWOT analysis, in which the strengths and weaknesses of the firm are assessed in light of the opportunities and threats in the business environment.

Alfred Chandler recognized the importance of coordinating management activity under an all-encompassing strategy. Interactions between functions were typically handled by managers who relayed information back and forth between departments. Chandler stressed the importance of taking a long-term perspective when looking to the future. In his 1962 ground breaking work &quot;Strategy and Structure&quot;, Chandler showed that a long-term coordinated strategy was necessary to give a company structure, direction and focus. He says it concisely, &quot;Structure follows Strategy.&quot; Chandler wrote that: &quot;&quot;Strategy is the determination of the basic long-term goals of an enterprise, and the adoption of courses of action and the allocation of resources necessary for carrying out these goals&quot;.&quot;

Igor Ansoff built on Chandler&#x27;s work by adding concepts and inventing a vocabulary. He developed a grid that compared strategies for market penetration, product development, market development and horizontal and vertical integration and diversification. He felt that management could use the grid to systematically prepare for the future. In his 1965 classic &quot;Corporate Strategy&quot;, he developed gap analysis to clarify the gap between the current reality and the goals and to develop what he called &quot;gap reducing actions&quot;. Ansoff wrote that strategic management had three parts: strategic planning; the skill of a firm in converting its plans into reality; and the skill of a firm in managing its own internal resistance to change.

Bruce Henderson, founder of the Boston Consulting Group, wrote about the concept of the experience curve in 1968, following initial work begun in 1965. The experience curve refers to a hypothesis that unit production costs decline by 20–30% every time cumulative production doubles. This supported the argument for achieving higher market share and economies of scale.

Porter wrote in 1980 that companies have to make choices about their scope and the type of competitive advantage they seek to achieve, whether lower cost or differentiation. The idea of strategy targeting particular industries and customers (i.e., competitive positions) with a differentiated offering was a departure from the experience-curve influenced strategy paradigm, which was focused on larger scale and lower cost. Porter revised the strategy paradigm again in 1985, writing that superior performance of the processes and activities performed by organizations as part of their value chain is the foundation of competitive advantage, thereby outlining a process view of strategy.

===Change in focus from production to marketing===
The direction of strategic research also paralleled a major paradigm shift in how companies competed, specifically a shift from the production focus to market focus. The prevailing concept in strategy up to the 1950s was to create a product of high technical quality. If you created a product that worked well and was durable, it was assumed you would have no difficulty profiting. This was called the production orientation. Henry Ford famously said of the Model T car: &quot;Any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants, so long as it is black.&quot;

Management theorist Peter F Drucker wrote in 1954 that it was the customer who defined what business the organization was in. In 1960 Theodore Levitt argued that instead of producing products then trying to sell them to the customer, businesses should start with the customer, find out what they wanted, and then produce it for them. The fallacy of the production orientation was also referred to as marketing myopia in an article of the same name by Levitt.

Over time, the customer became the driving force behind all strategic business decisions. This marketing concept, in the decades since its introduction, has been reformulated and repackaged under names including market orientation, customer orientation, customer intimacy, customer focus, customer-driven and market focus.

===Nature of strategy===
In 1985, Ellen Earle Chaffee summarized what she thought were the main elements of strategic management theory where consensus generally existed as of the 1970s, writing that strategic management:
* involves adapting the organization to its business environment;
* is fluid and complex. Change creates novel combinations of circumstances requiring unstructured non-repetitive responses;
* affects the entire organization by providing direction;
* involves both strategy formulation processes and also implementation of the content of the strategy;
* may be planned (intended) or unplanned (emergent); these may differ from each other and also from the realized strategy which results from them (Chaffee, p. 89)
* is done at several levels: overall corporate-level strategy, and individual business-level strategies; and
* involves both conceptual and analytical thought processes.

Chaffee further wrote that research up to that point covered three models of strategy, which were not mutually exclusive: 
#Linear strategy: a planned determination of goals, initiatives, and allocation of resources, along the lines of the Chandler definition above. This is most consistent with strategic planning approaches and may have a long planning horizon. The strategist &quot;deals with&quot; the environment but it is not the central concern.
#Adaptive strategy: in this model, the organization&#x27;s goals and activities are primarily concerned with adaptation to its environment, analogous to a biological organism. The need for continuous adaption reduces or eliminates the planning window. There is more focus on means (resource mobilization to address the environment) rather than ends (goals). Strategy is less centralized than in the linear model.
#Interpretive strategy: as a less developed model than the linear and adaptive models, dating from the 1970s, interpretive strategy is concerned with &quot;orienting metaphors constructed for the purpose of conceptualizing and guiding individual attitudes or organizational participants&quot;. The aim of interpretive strategy is legitimacy or credibility in the mind of stakeholders. It places emphasis on symbols and language to influence the minds of customers, rather than the physical product of the organization.

J I Moore identifies four related levels at which strategies can be devised: enterprise, corporate, business and functional Levels. The functional level applies to specific functional areas within an organisation such as its finance department, HR team or IT section.

In 2004, George Stalk, a Boston Consulting Group writer, distinguished between two extremes of business strategy using baseball metaphors:
*Softball: relying on weak competitive tactics which appear to be &quot;strategic&quot; but in fact &quot;do little more than keep the company in the game for the short term&quot;;
*Hardball: engaging with tough competitive strategies, &quot;relentlessly&quot; aiming for success.

==Concepts and frameworks==
The progress of strategy since 1960 can be charted by a variety of frameworks and concepts introduced by management consultants and academics. These reflect an increased focus on cost, competition and customers. These &quot;3 Cs&quot; were illuminated by much more robust empirical analysis at ever-more granular levels of detail, as industries and organizations were disaggregated into business units, activities, processes, and individuals in a search for sources of competitive advantage.

===SWOT analysis===
By the 1960s, the capstone business policy course at the Harvard Business School included the concept of matching the distinctive competence of a company (its internal strengths and weaknesses) with its environment (external opportunities and threats) in the context of its objectives. This framework came to be known by the acronym SWOT and was &quot;a major step forward in bringing explicitly competitive thinking to bear on questions of strategy&quot;. Kenneth R. Andrews helped popularize the framework via a 1963 conference and it remains commonly used in practice.

===Experience curve===
The experience curve was developed by the Boston Consulting Group in 1966. It reflects a hypothesis that total per unit costs decline systematically by as much as 15–25% every time cumulative production (i.e., &quot;experience&quot;) doubles. It has been empirically confirmed by some firms at various points in their history. Costs decline due to a variety of factors, such as the learning curve, substitution of labor for capital (automation), and technological sophistication. Author Walter Kiechel wrote that it reflected several insights, including:
*A company can always improve its cost structure;
*Competitors have varying cost positions based on their experience;
*Firms could achieve lower costs through higher market share, attaining a competitive advantage; and
*An increased focus on empirical analysis of costs and processes, a concept which author Kiechel refers to as &quot;Greater Taylorism&quot;.
Kiechel wrote in 2010: &quot;The experience curve was, simply, the most important concept in launching the strategy revolution...with the experience curve, the strategy revolution began to insinuate an acute awareness of competition into the corporate consciousness.&quot; Prior to the 1960s, the word competition rarely appeared in the most prominent management literature; U.S. companies then faced considerably less competition and did not focus on performance relative to peers. Further, the experience curve provided a basis for the retail sale of business ideas, helping drive the management consulting 
industry.

===Importance-performance matrix===
Completion of an importance-performance matrix forms &quot;a crucial stage in the formulation of operations strategy&quot;, and may be considered a &quot;simple, yet useful, method for simultaneously considering both the importance and performance dimensions when evaluating or defining strategy&quot;. Notes on this subject from the Department of Engineering at the University of Cambridge suggest that a binary matrix may be used &quot;but may be found too crude&quot;, and nine point scales on both the importance and performance axes are recommended. An importance scale could be labelled from &quot;the main thrust of competitiveness&quot; to &quot;never considered by customers and never likely to do so&quot;, and performance can be segmented into &quot;better than&quot;, &quot;the same as&quot;, and &quot;worse than&quot; the company&#x27;s competitors. The highest urgency would than be directed to the most important areas where performance is poorer than competitors.

The technique is also used in relation to marketing, where the variable &quot;importance&quot; is related to buyers&#x27; perception of important attributes of a product: for attributes which might be considered important to buyers, both their perceived importance and their performance are assessed.

===Corporate strategy and portfolio theory===

The concept of the corporation as a portfolio of business units, with each plotted graphically based on its market share (a measure of its competitive position relative to its peers) and industry growth rate (a measure of industry attractiveness), was summarized in the growth–share matrix developed by the Boston Consulting Group around 1970. By 1979, one study estimated that 45% of the Fortune 500 companies were using some variation of the matrix in their strategic planning. This framework helped companies decide where to invest their resources (i.e., in their high market share, high growth businesses) and which businesses to divest (i.e., low market share, low growth businesses.) The growth-share matrix was followed by G.E. multi factoral model, developed by General Electric.

Companies continued to diversify as conglomerates until the 1980s, when deregulation and a less restrictive antitrust environment led to the view that a portfolio of operating divisions in different industries was worth more as many independent companies, leading to the breakup of many conglomerates. While the popularity of portfolio theory has waxed and waned, the key dimensions considered (industry attractiveness and competitive position) remain central to strategy.

In response to the evident problems of &quot;over diversification&quot;, C. K. Prahalad and Gary Hamel suggested that companies should build portfolios of businesses around shared technical or operating competencies, and should develop structures and processes to enhance their core competencies.

Michael Porter also addressed the issue of the appropriate level of diversification. In 1987, he argued that corporate strategy involves two questions: 1) What business should the corporation be in? and 2) How should the corporate office manage its business units? He mentioned four concepts of corporate strategy each of which suggest a certain type of portfolio and a certain role for the corporate office; the latter three can be used together:
#Portfolio theory: A strategy based primarily on diversification through acquisition. The corporation shifts resources among the units and monitors the performance of each business unit and its leaders. Each unit generally runs autonomously, with limited interference from the corporate center provided goals are met. 
#Restructuring: The corporate office acquires then actively intervenes in a business where it detects potential, often by replacing management and implementing a new business strategy.
#Transferring skills: Important managerial skills and organizational capability are essentially spread to multiple businesses. The skills must be necessary to competitive advantage.
#Sharing activities: Ability of the combined corporation to leverage centralized functions, such as sales, finance, etc. thereby reducing costs.

Building on Porter&#x27;s ideas, Michael Goold, Andrew Campbell and Marcus Alexander developed the concept of &quot;parenting advantage&quot; to be applied at the corporate level, as a parallel to the concept of &quot;competitive advantage&quot; applied at the business level. Parent companies, they argued, should aim to &quot;add more value&quot; to their portfolio of businesses than rivals. If they succeed, they have a parenting advantage. The right level of diversification depends, therefore, on the ability of the parent company to add value in comparison to others. Different parent companies with different skills should expect to have different portfolios. See Corporate Level Strategy 1995 and Strategy for the Corporate Level 2014

===Competitive advantage===

In 1980, Porter defined the two types of competitive advantage an organization can achieve relative to its rivals: lower cost or differentiation. This advantage derives from attribute(s) that allow an organization to outperform its competition, such as superior market position, skills, or resources. In Porter&#x27;s view, strategic management should be concerned with building and sustaining competitive advantage.

===Industry structure and profitability===
Porter developed a framework for analyzing the profitability of industries and how those profits are divided among the participants in 1980. In five forces analysis he identified the forces that shape the industry structure or environment. The framework involves the bargaining power of buyers and suppliers, the threat of new entrants, the availability of substitute products, and the competitive rivalry of firms in the industry. These forces affect the organization&#x27;s ability to raise its prices as well as the costs of inputs (such as raw materials) for its processes.

The five forces framework helps describe how a firm can use these forces to obtain a sustainable competitive advantage, either lower cost or differentiation. Companies can maximize their profitability by competing in industries with favorable structure. Competitors can take steps to grow the overall profitability of the industry, or to take profit away from other parts of the industry structure. Porter modified Chandler&#x27;s dictum about structure following strategy by introducing a second level of structure: while organizational structure follows strategy, it in turn follows industry structure.

===Generic competitive strategies===
Porter wrote in 1980 that strategy target either cost leadership, differentiation, or focus. These are known as Porter&#x27;s three generic strategies and can be applied to any size or form of business. Porter claimed that a company must only choose one of the three or risk that the business would waste precious resources. Porter&#x27;s generic strategies detail the interaction between cost minimization strategies, product differentiation strategies, and market focus strategies.

Porter described an industry as having multiple &quot;segments&quot; that can be targeted by a firm. The breadth of its targeting refers to the &quot;competitive scope&quot; of the business. Porter defined two types of &quot;competitive advantage&quot;: lower cost or differentiation relative to its rivals. Achieving competitive advantage results from a firm&#x27;s ability to cope with the five forces better than its rivals. Porter wrote: &quot;[A]chieving competitive advantage requires a firm to make a choice...about the type of competitive advantage it seeks to attain and the scope within which it will attain it.&quot; He also wrote: &quot;The two basic types of competitive advantage [differentiation and lower cost] combined with the scope of activities for which a firm seeks to achieve them lead to three &quot;generic strategies&quot; for achieving above average performance in an industry: cost leadership, differentiation and focus. The focus strategy has two variants, cost focus and differentiation focus.&quot;

The concept of choice was a different perspective on strategy, as the 1970s paradigm was the pursuit of market share (size and scale) influenced by the experience curve. Companies that pursued the highest market share position to achieve cost advantages fit under Porter&#x27;s cost leadership generic strategy, but the concept of choice regarding differentiation and focus represented a new perspective.

===Value chain===
Porter&#x27;s 1985 description of the value chain refers to the chain of activities (processes or collections of processes) that an organization performs in order to deliver a valuable product or service for the market. These include functions such as inbound logistics, operations, outbound logistics, marketing and sales, and service, supported by systems and technology infrastructure. By aligning the various activities in its value chain with the organization&#x27;s strategy in a coherent way, a firm can achieve a competitive advantage. Porter also wrote that strategy is an internally consistent configuration of activities that differentiates a firm from its rivals. A robust competitive position cumulates from many activities which should fit coherently together.

Porter wrote in 1985: &quot;Competitive advantage cannot be understood by looking at a firm as a whole. It stems from the many discrete activities a firm performs in designing, producing, marketing, delivering and supporting its product. Each of these activities can contribute to a firm&#x27;s relative cost position and create a basis for differentiation...the value chain disaggregates a firm into its strategically relevant activities in order to understand the behavior of costs and the existing and potential sources of differentiation.&quot;

=== Interorganizational relationships ===
Interorganizational relationships allow independent organizations to get access to resources or to enter new markets. Interorganizational relationships represent a critical lever of competitive advantage.

The field of strategic management has paid much attention to the different forms of relationships between organizations ranging from strategic alliances to buyer-supplier relationships, joint ventures, networks, R&amp;D consortia, licensing, and franchising.

On the one hand, scholars drawing on organizational economics (e.g., transaction costs theory) have argued that firms use interorganizational relationships when they are the most efficient form comparatively to other forms of organization such as operating on its own or using the market. On the other hand, scholars drawing on organizational theory (e.g., resource dependence theory) suggest that firms tend to partner with others when such relationships allow them to improve their status, power, reputation, or legitimacy.

A key component to the strategic management of inter-organizational relationships relates to the choice of governance mechanisms. While early research focused on the choice between equity and non equity forms, recent scholarship studies the nature of the contractual and relational arrangements between organizations.

Researchers have also noted, although to a lesser extent, the dark side of interorganizational relationships, such as conflict, disputes, opportunism and unethical behaviors. Relational or collaborative risk can be defined as the uncertainty about whether potentially significant and/or disappointing outcomes of collaborative activities will be realized. Companies can assess, monitor and manage collaborative risks. Empirical studies show that managers assess risks as lower when they external partners, higher if they are satisfied with their own performance, and lower when their business environment is turbulent.

===Core competence===

Gary Hamel and C. K. Prahalad described the idea of core competency in 1990, the idea that each organization has some capability in which it excels and that the business should focus on opportunities in that area, letting others go or outsourcing them. Further, core competency is difficult to duplicate, as it involves the skills and coordination of people across a variety of functional areas or processes used to deliver value to customers. By outsourcing, companies expanded the concept of the value chain, with some elements within the entity and others without. Core competency is part of a branch of strategy called the &quot;resource-based view&quot; of the firm, which postulates that if activities are strategic as indicated by the value chain, then the organization&#x27;s capabilities and ability to learn or adapt are also strategic.

===Theory of the business===
According to Peter Drucker, business theory refers to the key points and strategies of a company, which are divided into three parts:

1. The external environment (society, technology, customers, and competition).

2. The goal of an organization.

3. Guidelines essential to achieving the mission.

This business theory has four differentiations:

1. Hypotheses maintain that mission and guidelines must be reality focused. 

2. Thoughts must have agreement.

3. The business theory must be notable and interpreted by the members of the organization.
4. Business theory must be continuously analyzed. 

Companies have difficulties when the assumptions of such a theory do not align with reality, Peter Drucker took as an example large retail premises, his goal was that people who wanted to buy in large commercial premises do so, but many consumers rejected commercial premises and preferred retailers (which focus on one or two categories of products and own their own premises) time was essential in shopping instead of profits . 
This theory is classified as an assumption and a discipline, which focused on the elaboration of systematic diagnoses, monitoring and testing of the guidelines that make up the business theory in order to maintain competition.
==Strategic thinking==
Strategic thinking involves the generation and application of unique business insights to opportunities intended to create competitive advantage for a firm or organization. It involves challenging the assumptions underlying the organization&#x27;s strategy and value proposition. Mintzberg wrote in 1994 that it is more about synthesis (i.e., &quot;connecting the dots&quot;) than analysis (i.e., &quot;finding the dots&quot;). It is about &quot;capturing what the manager learns from all sources (both the soft insights from his or her personal experiences and the experiences of others throughout the organization and the hard data from market research and the like) and then synthesizing that learning into a vision of the direction that the business should pursue.&quot; Mintzberg argued that strategic thinking is the critical part of formulating strategy, more so than strategic planning exercises.

General Andre Beaufre wrote in 1963 that strategic thinking &quot;is a mental process, at once abstract and rational, which must be capable of synthesizing both psychological and material data. The strategist must have a great capacity for both analysis and synthesis; analysis is necessary to assemble the data on which he makes his diagnosis, synthesis in order to produce from these data the diagnosis itself--and the diagnosis in fact amounts to a choice between alternative courses of action.&quot;

Will Mulcaster argued that while much research and creative thought has been devoted to generating alternative strategies, too little work has been done on what influences the quality of strategic decision making and the effectiveness with which strategies are implemented. For instance, in retrospect it can be seen that the financial crisis of 2008–9 could have been avoided if the banks had paid more attention to the risks associated with their investments, but how should banks change the way they make decisions to improve the quality of their decisions in the future? Mulcaster&#x27;s Managing Forces framework addresses this issue by identifying 11 forces that should be incorporated into the processes of decision making and strategic implementation. The 11 forces are: Time; Opposing forces; Politics; Perception; Holistic effects; Adding value; Incentives; Learning capabilities; Opportunity cost; Risk and Style.

Classic strategy thinking, and vision have some limitations in a turbulent environment and uncertainty. The limitations relate to the heterogeneity and future-oriented goals and possession of cognitive capabilities in classic definition. Strategy should not be seen only from the top managerial hierarchy visions. The newer micro foundation framework suggests that people from different managerial levels are needed to work and interact dynamically to result in the knowledge strategy.

==Strategic planning==

Strategic planning is a means of administering the formulation and implementation of strategy. Strategic planning is analytical in nature and refers to formalized procedures to produce the data and analyses used as inputs for strategic thinking, which synthesizes the data resulting in the strategy. Strategic planning may also refer to control mechanisms used to implement the strategy once it is determined. In other words, strategic planning happens &quot;around&quot; the strategy formation process.

===Environmental analysis===
Porter wrote in 1980 that formulation of competitive strategy includes consideration of four key elements:
#Company strengths and weaknesses;
#Personal values of the key implementers (i.e., management and the board)
#Industry opportunities and threats; and
#Broader societal expectations.
The first two elements relate to factors internal to the company (i.e., the internal environment), while the latter two relate to factors external to the company (i.e., the external environment).

There are many analytical frameworks which attempt to organize the strategic planning process. Examples of frameworks that address the four elements described above include:
*External environment: PEST analysis or STEEP analysis is a framework used to examine the remote external environmental factors that can affect the organization, such as political, economic, social/demographic, and technological. Common variations include SLEPT, PESTLE, STEEPLE, and STEER analysis, each of which incorporates slightly different emphases.
*Industry environment: The Porter Five Forces Analysis framework helps to determine the competitive rivalry and therefore attractiveness of a market. It is used to help determine the portfolio of offerings the organization will provide and in which markets.
*Relationship of internal and external environment: SWOT analysis is one of the most basic and widely used frameworks, which examines both internal elements of the organization—Strengths and Weaknesses—and external elements—Opportunities and Threats. It helps examine the organization&#x27;s resources in the context of its environment.

===Scenario planning===
A number of strategists use scenario planning techniques to deal with change. The way Peter Schwartz put it in 1991 is that strategic outcomes cannot be known in advance so the sources of competitive advantage cannot be predetermined. The fast changing business environment is too uncertain for us to find sustainable value in formulas of excellence or competitive advantage. Instead, scenario planning is a technique in which multiple outcomes can be developed, their implications assessed, and their likeliness of occurrence evaluated. According to Pierre Wack, scenario planning is about insight, complexity, and subtlety, not about formal analysis and numbers.

Some business planners are starting to use a complexity theory approach to strategy. Complexity can be thought of as chaos with a dash of order. Chaos theory deals with turbulent systems that rapidly become disordered. Complexity is not quite so unpredictable. It involves multiple agents interacting in such a way that a glimpse of structure may appear.

===Measuring and controlling implementation===

Once the strategy is determined, various goals and measures may be established to chart a course for the organization, measure performance and control implementation of the strategy. Tools such as the balanced scorecard and strategy maps help crystallize the strategy, by relating key measures of success and performance to the strategy. These tools measure financial, marketing, production, organizational development, and innovation measures to achieve a &#x27;balanced&#x27; perspective. Advances in information technology and data availability enable the gathering of more information about performance, allowing managers to take a much more analytical view of their business than before.

Strategy may also be organized as a series of &quot;initiatives&quot; or &quot;programs&quot;, each of which comprises one or more projects. Various monitoring and feedback mechanisms may also be established, such as regular meetings between divisional and corporate management to control implementation.

===Evaluation===
A key component to strategic management which is often overlooked when planning is evaluation. Evaluation may involve looking at what was done (implementation) and what happened as a result, or it may involve evaluating options to see what potential different options may open up, in order to decide on planned actions.

There are many ways to evaluate whether or not strategic priorities and plans have been achieved, one such method is Robert Stake&#x27;s Responsive Evaluation. Responsive evaluation provides a naturalistic and humanistic approach to program evaluation. In expanding beyond the goal-oriented or pre-ordinate evaluation design, responsive evaluation takes into consideration the program&#x27;s background (history), conditions, and transactions among stakeholders. It is largely emergent, the design unfolds as contact is made with stakeholders.

==Limitations==
While strategies are established to set direction, focus effort, define or clarify the organization, and provide consistency or guidance in response to the environment, these very elements also mean that certain signals are excluded from consideration or de-emphasized. Mintzberg wrote in 1987: &quot;Strategy is a categorizing scheme by which incoming stimuli can be ordered and dispatched.&quot; Since a strategy orients the organization in a particular manner or direction, that direction may not effectively match the environment, initially (if a bad strategy) or over time as circumstances change. As such, Mintzberg continued, &quot;Strategy [once established] is a force that resists change, not encourages it.&quot;

Therefore, a critique of strategic management is that it can overly constrain managerial discretion in a dynamic environment. &quot;How can individuals, organizations and societies cope as well as possible with ... issues too complex to be fully understood, given the fact that actions initiated on the basis of inadequate understanding may lead to significant regret?&quot; Some theorists insist on an iterative approach, considering in turn objectives, implementation and resources. I.e., a &quot;...repetitive learning cycle [rather than] a linear progression towards a clearly defined final destination.&quot; Strategies must be able to adjust during implementation because &quot;humans rarely can proceed satisfactorily except by learning from experience; and modest probes, serially modified on the basis of feedback, usually are the best method for such learning.&quot;

In 2000, Gary Hamel coined the term strategic convergence to explain the limited scope of the strategies being used by rivals in greatly differing circumstances. He lamented that successful strategies are imitated by firms that do not understand that for a strategy to work, it must account for the specifics of each situation.
Woodhouse and Collingridge claim that the essence of being &quot;strategic&quot; lies in a capacity for &quot;intelligent trial-and error&quot; rather than strict adherence to finely honed strategic plans. Strategy should be seen as laying out the general path rather than precise steps. Means are as likely to determine ends as ends are to determine means. The objectives that an organization might wish to pursue are limited by the range of feasible approaches to implementation. (There will usually be only a small number of approaches that will not only be technically and administratively possible, but also satisfactory to the full range of organizational stakeholders.) In turn, the range of feasible implementation approaches is determined by the availability of resources.

==Strategic themes==
Various strategic approaches used across industries (themes) have arisen over the years. These include the shift from product-driven demand to customer- or marketing-driven demand (described above), the increased use of self-service approaches to lower cost, changes in the value chain or corporate structure due to globalization (e.g., off-shoring of production and assembly), and the internet.

===Self-service===
One theme in strategic competition has been the trend towards self-service, often enabled by technology, where the customer takes on a role previously performed by a worker to lower costs for the firm and perhaps prices. Examples include:
*Automated teller machine (ATM) to obtain cash rather via a bank teller;
*Self-service at the gas pump rather than with help from an attendant;
*Retail internet orders input by the customer rather than a retail clerk, such as online book sales;
*Mass-produced ready-to-assemble furniture transported by the customer; 
*Self-checkout at the grocery store; and
*Online banking and bill payment.

===Globalization and the virtual firm===
One definition of globalization refers to the integration of economies due to technology and supply chain process innovation. Companies are no longer required to be vertically integrated (i.e., designing, producing, assembling, and selling their products). In other words, the value chain for a company&#x27;s product may no longer be entirely within one firm; several entities comprising a virtual firm may exist to fulfill the customer requirement. For example, some companies have chosen to outsource production to third parties, retaining only design and sales functions inside their organization.

===Internet and information availability===

The internet has dramatically empowered consumers and enabled buyers and sellers to come together with drastically reduced transaction and intermediary costs, creating much more robust marketplaces for the purchase and sale of goods and services. The Internet has enabled many Internet-based entrepreneurs to tap serendipity as a strategic advantage and thrive. Examples include online auction sites, internet dating services, and internet book sellers. In many industries, the internet has dramatically altered the competitive landscape. Services that used to be provided within one entity (e.g., a car dealership providing financing and pricing information) are now provided by third parties. Further, compared to traditional media like television, the internet has caused a major shift in viewing habits through on demand content which has led to an increasingly fragmented audience.

Author Phillip Evans said in 2013 that networks are challenging traditional hierarchies. Value chains may also be breaking up (&quot;deconstructing&quot;) where information aspects can be separated from functional activity. Data that is readily available for free or very low cost makes it harder for information-based, vertically integrated businesses to remain intact. Evans said: &quot;The basic story here is that what used to be vertically integrated, oligopolistic competition among essentially similar kinds of competitors is evolving, by one means or another, from a vertical structure to a horizontal one. Why is that happening? It&#x27;s happening because transaction costs are plummeting and because scale is polarizing. The plummeting of transaction costs weakens the glue that holds value chains together, and allows them to separate.&quot; He used Wikipedia as an example of a network that has challenged the traditional encyclopedia business model. Evans predicts the emergence of a new form of industrial organization called a &quot;stack&quot;, analogous to a technology stack, in which competitors rely on a common platform of inputs (services or information), essentially layering the remaining competing parts of their value chains on top of this common platform.

===Sustainability===
In the recent decade, sustainability—or ability to successfully sustain a company in a context of rapidly changing environmental, social, health, and economic circumstances—has emerged as crucial aspect of any strategy development. Research focusing on sustainability in commercial strategies has led to emergence of the concept of &quot;embedded sustainability&quot; – defined by its authors Chris Laszlo and Nadya Zhexembayeva as &quot;incorporation of environmental, health, and social value into the core business with no trade-off in price or quality—in other words, with no social or green premium.&quot; Their research showed that embedded sustainability offers at least seven distinct opportunities for business value and competitive advantage creation: a) better risk management, b) increased efficiency through reduced waste and resource use, c) better product differentiation, d) new market entrances, e) enhanced brand and reputation, f) greater opportunity to influence industry standards, and g) greater opportunity for radical innovation. Research further suggested that innovation driven by resource depletion can result in fundamental competitive advantages for a company&#x27;s products and services, as well as the company strategy as a whole, when right principles of innovation are applied. Asset managers who committed to integrating embedded sustainability factors in their capital allocation decisions created a stronger return on investment than managers that did not strategically integrate sustainability into their similar business model.

To achieve genuine sustainability and these associated benefits, corporations have historically relied on a variety of mechanisms that can be integrated into their management strategy. Timothy Galpin in his chapter of “Business Strategies for Sustainability: A Research Anthology” discusses four “Internal Strategic Management Components” to build sustainability. They are as follows:

* Mission: Defines the purpose and priorities of the organization, ultimately providing critical signals to organizational stakeholders regarding the aims of the firm.
* Values: Refers to the expectations of internal stakeholders, and communicates the organisation’s belief system to various external stakeholders
* Goals: Provides a roadmap of the firm’s organisational activity and a basis for which to measure progress and performance.
* Capabilities and resources: The development of patterns of activity and investment decisions that facilitate sustainable business practices.

To fully utilise these strategic management components, a firm’s mission, values, goals, resources, and capabilities need to be functioning in alignment with one another. This develops consistency across management and employee behaviour. Research has indicated that this alignment has led to improved firm performance.   

Following the embedding of sustainability in a firm’s strategic management plan, to fully reap the benefits the agenda must be communicated effectively to internal and external stakeholders. Doing so satisfies stakeholder theory, whereby the firm maintains ‘trustful and mutually respectful relationships with the various stakeholders’. In the past, this has consisted of advertising and disclosing sustainability information and reports. Firms are available to promote their superior sustainability performance and ultimately possess higher market valuations in comparison to firms that do not provide sustainability reporting.

The amalgamation and alignment of these key internal strategic management components, in conjunction with thorough communication of the firm’s sustainability agenda, is required to achieve these associated benefits and is the reason many firms are pursuing such tactics more frequently.

==Strategy as learning==
=== Learning organization ===
In 1990, Peter Senge, who had collaborated with Arie de Geus at Dutch Shell, popularized de Geus&#x27; notion of the &quot;learning organization&quot;. The theory is that gathering and analyzing information is a necessary requirement for business success in the information age. To do this, Senge claimed that an organization would need to be structured such that:

* People can continuously expand their capacity to learn and be productive.
* New patterns of thinking are nurtured.
* Collective aspirations are encouraged.
* People are encouraged to see the &quot;whole picture&quot; together.

Senge identified five disciplines of a learning organization. They are:

* Personal responsibility, self-reliance, and mastery – We accept that we are the masters of our own destiny. We make decisions and live with the consequences of them. When a problem needs to be fixed, or an opportunity exploited, we take the initiative to learn the required skills to get it done.
* Mental models – We need to explore our personal mental models to understand the subtle effect they have on our behaviour.
* Shared vision – The vision of where we want to be in the future is discussed and communicated to all. It provides guidance and energy for the journey ahead.
* Team learning – We learn together in teams. This involves a shift from &quot;a spirit of advocacy to a spirit of enquiry&quot;.
* Systems thinking – We look at the whole rather than the parts. This is what Senge calls the &quot;Fifth discipline&quot;. It is the glue that integrates the other four into a coherent strategy. For an alternative approach to the &quot;learning organization&quot;, see Garratt, B. (1987).

Geoffrey Moore (1991) and R. Frank and P. Cook also detected a shift in the nature of competition. Markets driven by technical standards or by &quot;network effects&quot; can give the dominant firm a near-monopoly. The same is true of networked industries in which interoperability requires compatibility between users. Examples include Internet Explorer&#x27;s and Amazon&#x27;s early dominance of their respective industries. IE&#x27;s later decline shows that such dominance may be only temporary.

Moore showed how firms could attain this enviable position by using E.M. Rogers&#x27; five stage adoption process and focusing on one group of customers at a time, using each group as a base for reaching the next group. The most difficult step is making the transition between introduction and mass acceptance. (See Crossing the Chasm). If successful a firm can create a bandwagon effect in which the momentum builds and its product becomes a &quot;de facto&quot; standard.

=== Integrated view to learning ===
Bolisani &amp; Bratianu (2017) have defined knowledge strategy as an integration of rational thinking and dynamic learning. Rational planning contains a three-step process where the first step is to collect information, the second step is to analyze the information and the third step is to formulate goals and plans based on information. Emergent planning also contains three steps to the opposite direction starting from practical experience, what is analyzed in the second step, and then formulated to a strategy in the third step. These two approaches are combined to the “integrated view” with the Bolisani and Bratianu research implications. To start the planning process for knowledge and KM strategy creation, company can prepare a preliminary plan with the basis of rational analysis from internal or external environments. While creating rational and predictive plans, company can similarly utilize practical adapted knowledge for example learning from the ground. The idea behind the integrated view is to combine the general visions of knowledge strategy with both the current practical understanding and future ideas. This model will move the decision-making process in a more interactive and co-creative direction.

==Strategy as adapting to change==
In 1969, Peter Drucker coined the phrase &quot;Age of Discontinuity&quot; to describe the way change disrupts lives. In an age of continuity attempts to predict the future by extrapolating from the past can be accurate. But according to Drucker, we are now in an age of discontinuity and extrapolating is ineffective. He identifies four sources of discontinuity: new technologies, globalization, cultural pluralism and knowledge capital.

In 1970, Alvin Toffler in &quot;Future Shock&quot; described a trend towards accelerating rates of change. He illustrated how social and technical phenomena had shorter lifespans with each generation, and he questioned society&#x27;s ability to cope with the resulting turmoil and accompanying anxiety. In past eras periods of change were always punctuated with times of stability. This allowed society to assimilate the change before the next change arrived. But these periods of stability had all but disappeared by the late 20th century. In 1980 in &quot;The Third Wave&quot;, Toffler characterized this shift to relentless change as the defining feature of the third phase of civilization (the first two phases being the agricultural and industrial waves).

In 1978, Derek F. Abell (Abell, D. 1978) described &quot;strategic windows&quot; and stressed the importance of the timing (both entrance and exit) of any given strategy. This led some strategic planners to build planned obsolescence into their strategies.

In 1983, Noel Tichy wrote that because we are all beings of habit we tend to repeat what we are comfortable with. He wrote that this is a trap that constrains our creativity, prevents us from exploring new ideas, and hampers our dealing with the full complexity of new issues. He developed a systematic method of dealing with change that involved looking at any new issue from three angles: technical and production, political and resource allocation, and corporate culture.

In 1989, Charles Handy identified two types of change. &quot;Strategic drift&quot; is a gradual change that occurs so subtly that it is not noticed until it is too late. By contrast, &quot;transformational change&quot; is sudden and radical. It is typically caused by discontinuities (or exogenous shocks) in the business environment. The point where a new trend is initiated is called a &quot;strategic inflection point&quot; by Andy Grove. Inflection points can be subtle or radical.

In 1990, Richard Pascale wrote that relentless change requires that businesses continuously reinvent themselves. His famous maxim is &quot;Nothing fails like success&quot; by which he means that what was a strength yesterday becomes the root of weakness today, We tend to depend on what worked yesterday and refuse to let go of what worked so well for us in the past. Prevailing strategies become self-confirming. To avoid this trap, businesses must stimulate a spirit of inquiry and healthy debate. They must encourage a creative process of self-renewal based on constructive conflict.

In 1996, Adrian Slywotzky showed how changes in the business environment are reflected in value migrations between industries, between companies, and within companies. He claimed that recognizing the patterns behind these value migrations is necessary if we wish to understand the world of chaotic change. In &quot;Profit Patterns&quot; (1999) he described businesses as being in a state of strategic anticipation as they try to spot emerging patterns. Slywotsky and his team identified 30 patterns that have transformed industry after industry.

In 1997, Clayton Christensen (1997) took the position that great companies can fail precisely because they do everything right since the capabilities of the organization also define its disabilities. Christensen&#x27;s thesis is that outstanding companies lose their market leadership when confronted with disruptive technology. He called the approach to discovering the emerging markets for disruptive technologies agnostic marketing, i.e., marketing under the implicit assumption that no one – not the company, not the customers – can know how or in what quantities a disruptive product can or will be used without the experience of using it.

In 1999, Constantinos Markides reexamined the nature of strategic planning. He described strategy formation and implementation as an ongoing, never-ending, integrated process requiring continuous reassessment and reformation. Strategic management is planned and emergent, dynamic and interactive.

J. Moncrieff (1999) stressed strategy dynamics. He claimed that strategy is partially deliberate and partially unplanned. The unplanned element comes from emergent strategies that result from the emergence of opportunities and threats in the environment and from &quot;strategies in action&quot; (ad hoc actions across the organization).

David Teece pioneered research on resource-based strategic management and the dynamic capabilities perspective, defined as &quot;the ability to integrate, build, and reconfigure internal and external competencies to address rapidly changing environments&quot;. His 1997 paper (with Gary Pisano and Amy Shuen) &quot;Dynamic Capabilities and Strategic Management&quot; was the most cited paper in economics and business for the period from 1995 to 2005.

In 2000, Gary Hamel discussed strategic decay, the notion that the value of every strategy, no matter how brilliant, decays over time.

==Strategy as operational excellence==

===Quality===
A large group of theorists felt the area where western business was most lacking was product quality. W. Edwards Deming, Joseph M. Juran, Andrew Thomas Kearney, Philip Crosby and Armand V. Feigenbaum suggested quality improvement techniques such total quality management (TQM), continuous improvement (kaizen), lean manufacturing, Six Sigma, and return on quality (ROQ).

Contrarily, James Heskett (1988), Earl Sasser (1995), William Davidow, Len Schlesinger, A. Paraurgman (1988), Len Berry, Jane Kingman-Brundage, Christopher Hart, and Christopher Lovelock (1994), felt that poor customer service was the problem. They gave us fishbone diagramming, service charting, Total Customer Service (TCS), the service profit chain, service gaps analysis, the service encounter, strategic service vision, service mapping, and service teams. Their underlying assumption was that there is no better source of competitive advantage than a continuous stream of delighted customers.

Process management uses some of the techniques from product quality management and some of the techniques from customer service management. It looks at an activity as a sequential process. The objective is to find inefficiencies and make the process more effective. Although the procedures have a long history, dating back to Taylorism, the scope of their applicability has been greatly widened, leaving no aspect of the firm free from potential process improvements. Because of the broad applicability of process management techniques, they can be used as a basis for competitive advantage.

Carl Sewell, Frederick F. Reichheld, Christian Grönroos, and Earl Sasser observed that businesses were spending more on customer acquisition than on retention. They showed how a competitive advantage could be found in ensuring that customers returned again and again. Reicheld broadened the concept to include loyalty from employees, suppliers, distributors and shareholders. They developed techniques for estimating customer lifetime value (CLV) for assessing long-term relationships. The concepts begat attempts to recast selling and marketing into a long term endeavor that created a sustained relationship (called relationship selling, relationship marketing, and customer relationship management). Customer relationship management (CRM) software became integral to many firms.

===Reengineering===
Michael Hammer and James Champy felt that these resources needed to be restructured. In a process that they labeled reengineering, firm&#x27;s reorganized their assets around whole processes rather than tasks. In this way a team of people saw a project through, from inception to completion. This avoided functional silos where isolated departments seldom talked to each other. It also eliminated waste due to functional overlap and interdepartmental communications.

In 1989 Richard Lester and the researchers at the MIT Industrial Performance Center identified seven best practices and concluded that firms must accelerate the shift away from the mass production of low cost standardized products. The seven areas of best practice were:

* Simultaneous continuous improvement in cost, quality, service, and product innovation
* Breaking down organizational barriers between departments
* Eliminating layers of management creating flatter organizational hierarchies.
* Closer relationships with customers and suppliers
* Intelligent use of new technology
* Global focus
* Improving human resource skills

The search for best practices is also called benchmarking. This involves determining where you need to improve, finding an organization that is exceptional in this area, then studying the company and applying its best practices in your firm.

==Other perspectives on strategy==

===Strategy as problem solving===
Professor Richard P. Rumelt described strategy as a type of problem solving in 2011. He wrote that good strategy has an underlying structure called a &quot;kernel&quot;. The kernel has three parts: 1) A &quot;diagnosis&quot; that defines or explains the nature of the challenge; 2) A &quot;guiding policy&quot; for dealing with the challenge; and 3) Coherent &quot;actions&quot; designed to carry out the guiding policy.
President Kennedy outlined these three elements of strategy in his Cuban Missile Crisis Address to the Nation of 22 October 1962: 
#Diagnosis: &quot;This Government, as promised, has maintained the closest surveillance of the Soviet military buildup on the island of Cuba. Within the past week, unmistakable evidence has established the fact that a series of offensive missile sites is now in preparation on that imprisoned island. The purpose of these bases can be none other than to provide a nuclear strike capability against the Western Hemisphere.&quot;
#Guiding Policy: &quot;Our unswerving objective, therefore, must be to prevent the use of these missiles against this or any other country, and to secure their withdrawal or elimination from the Western Hemisphere.&quot;
#Action Plans: First among seven numbered steps was the following: &quot;To halt this offensive buildup a strict quarantine on all offensive military equipment under shipment to Cuba is being initiated. All ships of any kind bound for Cuba from whatever nation or port will, if found to contain cargoes of offensive weapons, be turned back.&quot;

Active strategic management required active information gathering and active problem solving. In the early days of Hewlett-Packard (HP), Dave Packard and Bill Hewlett devised an active management style that they called &quot;management by walking around&quot; (MBWA). Senior HP managers were seldom at their desks. They spent most of their days visiting employees, customers, and suppliers. This direct contact with key people provided them with a solid grounding from which viable strategies could be crafted. Management consultants Tom Peters and Robert H. Waterman had used the term in their 1982 book &quot;In Search of Excellence: Lessons From America&#x27;s Best-Run Companies&quot;. Some Japanese managers employ a similar system, which originated at Honda, and is sometimes called the 3 G&#x27;s (Genba, Genbutsu, and Genjitsu, which translate into &quot;actual place&quot;, &quot;actual thing&quot;, and &quot;actual situation&quot;).

===Creative vs analytic approaches===
In 2010, IBM released a study summarizing three conclusions of 1500 CEOs around the world: 1) complexity is escalating, 2) enterprises are not equipped to cope with this complexity, and 3) creativity is now the single most important leadership competency. IBM said that it is needed in all aspects of leadership, including strategic thinking and planning.

Similarly, McKeown argued that over-reliance on any particular approach to strategy is dangerous and that multiple methods can be used to combine the creativity and analytics to create an &quot;approach to shaping the future&quot;, that is difficult to copy.

===Non-strategic management===
A 1938 treatise by Chester Barnard, based on his own experience as a business executive, described the process as informal, intuitive, non-routinized and involving primarily oral, 2-way communications. Bernard says &quot;The process is the sensing of the organization as a whole and the total situation relevant to it. It transcends the capacity of merely intellectual methods, and the techniques of discriminating the factors of the situation. The terms pertinent to it are &quot;feeling&quot;, &quot;judgement&quot;, &quot;sense&quot;, &quot;proportion&quot;, &quot;balance&quot;, &quot;appropriateness&quot;. It is a matter of art rather than science.&quot;

In 1973, Mintzberg found that senior managers typically deal with unpredictable situations so they strategize in &quot;ad hoc&quot;, flexible, dynamic, and implicit ways. He wrote, &quot;The job breeds adaptive information-manipulators who prefer the live concrete situation. The manager works in an environment of stimulus-response, and he develops in his work a clear preference for live action.&quot;

In 1982, John Kotter studied the daily activities of 15 executives and concluded that they spent most of their time developing and working a network of relationships that provided general insights and specific details for strategic decisions. They tended to use &quot;mental road maps&quot; rather than systematic planning techniques.

Daniel Isenberg&#x27;s 1984 study of senior managers found that their decisions were highly intuitive. Executives often sensed what they were going to do before they could explain why. He claimed in 1986 that one of the reasons for this is the complexity of strategic decisions and the resultant information uncertainty.

Zuboff claimed that information technology was widening the divide between senior managers (who typically make strategic decisions) and operational level managers (who typically make routine decisions). She alleged that prior to the widespread use of computer systems, managers, even at the most senior level, engaged in both strategic decisions and routine administration, but as computers facilitated (She called it &quot;deskilled&quot;) routine processes, these activities were moved further down the hierarchy, leaving senior management free for strategic decision making.

In 1977, Abraham Zaleznik distinguished leaders from managers. He described leaders as visionaries who inspire, while managers care about process. He claimed that the rise of managers was the main cause of the decline of American business in the 1970s and 1980s. Lack of leadership is most damaging at the level of strategic management where it can paralyze an entire organization.

According to Corner, Kinichi, and Keats, strategic decision making in organizations occurs at two levels: individual and aggregate. They developed a model of parallel strategic decision making. The model identifies two parallel processes that involve getting attention, encoding information, storage and retrieval of information, strategic choice, strategic outcome and feedback. The individual and organizational processes interact at each stage. For instance, competition-oriented objectives are based on the knowledge of competing firms, such as their market share.

===Strategy as marketing===
The 1980s also saw the widespread acceptance of positioning theory. Although the theory originated with Jack Trout in 1969, it didn&#x27;t gain wide acceptance until Al Ries and Jack Trout wrote their classic book &quot;Positioning: The Battle For Your Mind&quot; (1979). The basic premise is that a strategy should not be judged by internal company factors but by the way customers see it relative to the competition. Crafting and implementing a strategy involves creating a position in the mind of the collective consumer. Several techniques enabled the practical use of positioning theory. Perceptual mapping for example, creates visual displays of the relationships between positions. Multidimensional scaling, discriminant analysis, factor analysis and conjoint analysis are mathematical techniques used to determine the most relevant characteristics (called dimensions or factors) upon which positions should be based. Preference regression can be used to determine vectors of ideal positions and cluster analysis can identify clusters of positions.

In 1992 Jay Barney saw strategy as assembling the optimum mix of resources, including human, technology and suppliers, and then configuring them in unique and sustainable ways. 

James Gilmore and Joseph Pine found competitive advantage in mass customization. Flexible manufacturing techniques allowed businesses to individualize products for each customer without losing economies of scale. This effectively turned the product into a service. They also realized that if a service is mass-customized by creating a &quot;performance&quot; for each individual client, that service would be transformed into an &quot;experience&quot;. Their book, &quot;The Experience Economy&quot;, along with the work of Bernd Schmitt convinced many to see service provision as a form of theatre. This school of thought is sometimes referred to as customer experience management (CEM).

===Information- and technology-driven strategy===
Many industries with a high information component are being transformed. For example, Encarta demolished Encyclopædia Britannica (whose sales have plummeted 80% since their peak of $650 million in 1990) before it was in turn, eclipsed by collaborative encyclopedias like Wikipedia. The music industry was similarly disrupted. The technology sector has provided some strategies directly. For example, from the software development industry agile software development provides a model for shared development processes.

Peter Drucker conceived of the &quot;knowledge worker&quot; in the 1950s. He described how fewer workers would do physical labor, and more would apply their minds. In 1984, John Naisbitt theorized that the future would be driven largely by information: companies that managed information well could obtain an advantage, however the profitability of what he called &quot;information float&quot; (information that the company had and others desired) would disappear as inexpensive computers made information more accessible.

Daniel Bell (1985) examined the sociological consequences of information technology, while Gloria Schuck and Shoshana Zuboff looked at psychological factors. Zuboff distinguished between &quot;automating technologies&quot; and &quot;informating technologies&quot;. She studied the effect that both had on workers, managers and organizational structures. She largely confirmed Drucker&#x27;s predictions about the importance of flexible decentralized structure, work teams, knowledge sharing and the knowledge worker&#x27;s central role. Zuboff also detected a new basis for managerial authority, based on knowledge (also predicted by Drucker) which she called &quot;participative management&quot;.

===Maturity of planning process===
McKinsey &amp; Company developed a capability maturity model in the 1970s to describe the sophistication of planning processes, with strategic management ranked the highest. The four stages include:
#Financial planning, which is primarily about annual budgets and a functional focus, with limited regard for the environment;
#Forecast-based planning, which includes multi-year budgets and more robust capital allocation across business units;
#Externally oriented planning, where a thorough situation analysis and competitive assessment is performed; 
#Strategic management, where widespread strategic thinking occurs and a well-defined strategic framework is used.

===PIMS study===
The long-term PIMS study, started in the 1960s and lasting for 19 years, attempted to understand the Profit Impact of Marketing Strategies (PIMS), particularly the effect of market share. The initial conclusion of the study was unambiguous: the greater a company&#x27;s market share, the greater their rate of profit. Market share provides economies of scale. It also provides experience curve advantages. The combined effect is increased profits.

The benefits of high market share naturally led to an interest in growth strategies. The relative advantages of horizontal integration, vertical integration, diversification, franchises, mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures and organic growth were discussed. Other research indicated that a low market share strategy could still be very profitable. Schumacher (1973), Woo and Cooper (1982), Levenson (1984), and later Traverso (2002) showed how smaller niche players obtained very high returns.

==Other influences on business strategy==

===Military strategy===

In the 1980s business strategists realized that there was a vast knowledge base stretching back thousands of years that they had barely examined. They turned to military strategy for guidance. Military strategy books such as &quot;The Art of War&quot; by Sun Tzu, &quot;On War&quot; by von Clausewitz, and &quot;The Red Book&quot; by Mao Zedong became business classics. From Sun Tzu, they learned the tactical side of military strategy and specific tactical prescriptions. From von Clausewitz, they learned the dynamic and unpredictable nature of military action. From Mao, they learned the principles of guerrilla warfare. Important marketing warfare books include &quot;Business War Games&quot; by Barrie James, &quot;Marketing Warfare&quot; by Al Ries and Jack Trout and &quot;Leadership Secrets of Attila the Hun&quot; by Wess Roberts. The marketing warfare literature also examined leadership and motivation, intelligence gathering, types of marketing weapons, logistics and communications.

By the twenty-first century marketing warfare strategies had gone out of favour in favor of non-confrontational approaches. In 1989, Dudley Lynch and Paul L. Kordis published &quot;Strategy of the Dolphin: Scoring a Win in a Chaotic World&quot;. &quot;The Strategy of the Dolphin&quot; was developed to give guidance as to when to use aggressive strategies and when to use passive strategies. A variety of aggressive strategies were developed.

In 1993, J. Moore used a similar metaphor. Instead of using military terms, he created an ecological theory of predators and prey(see ecological model of competition), a sort of Darwinian management strategy in which market interactions mimic long term ecological stability.

Author Phillip Evans said in 2014 that &quot;Henderson&#x27;s central idea was what you might call the Napoleonic idea of concentrating mass against weakness, of overwhelming the enemy. What Henderson recognized was that, in the business world, there are many phenomena which are characterized by what economists would call increasing returns—scale, experience. The more you do of something, disproportionately the better you get. And therefore he found a logic for investing in such kinds of overwhelming mass in order to achieve competitive advantage. And that was the first introduction of essentially a military concept of strategy into the business world. ... It was on those two ideas, Henderson&#x27;s idea of increasing returns to scale and experience, and Porter&#x27;s idea of the value chain, encompassing heterogenous elements, that the whole edifice of business strategy was subsequently erected.&quot;

==Traits of successful companies==
Like Peters and Waterman a decade earlier, James Collins and Jerry Porras spent years conducting empirical research on what makes great companies. Six years of research uncovered a key underlying principle behind the 19 successful companies that they studied: They all encourage and preserve a core ideology that nurtures the company. Even though strategy and tactics change daily, the companies, nevertheless, were able to maintain a core set of values. These core values encourage employees to build an organization that lasts. In &quot;Built To Last&quot; (1994) they claim that short term profit goals, cost cutting, and restructuring will not stimulate dedicated employees to build a great company that will endure. In 2000 Collins coined the term &quot;built to flip&quot; to describe the prevailing business attitudes in Silicon Valley. It describes a business culture where technological change inhibits a long term focus. He also popularized the concept of the BHAG (Big Hairy Audacious Goal).

Arie de Geus (1997) undertook a similar study and obtained similar results. He identified four key traits of companies that had prospered for 50 years or more. They are:
* Sensitivity to the business environment – the ability to learn and adjust
* Cohesion and identity – the ability to build a community with personality, vision, and purpose
* Tolerance and decentralization – the ability to build relationships
* Conservative financing

A company with these key characteristics he called a &quot;living company&quot; because it is able to perpetuate itself. If a company emphasizes knowledge rather than finance, and sees itself as an ongoing community of human beings, it has the potential to become great and endure for decades. Such an organization is an organic entity capable of learning (he called it a &quot;learning organization&quot;) and capable of creating its own processes, goals, and persona.

Will Mulcaster suggests that firms engage in a dialogue that centres around these questions:

*Will the proposed competitive advantage create Perceived Differential Value?&quot;
*Will the proposed competitive advantage create something that is different from the competition?&quot;
*Will the difference add value in the eyes of potential customers?&quot; – This question will entail a discussion of the combined effects of price, product features and consumer perceptions.
*Will the product add value for the firm?&quot; – Answering this question will require an examination of cost effectiveness and the pricing strategy.

<text>Jodeci ( ) is an American R&amp;B quartet consisting of members DeVanté Swing, Mr. Dalvin, K-Ci, and JoJo. Formed in 1988 in Charlotte, North Carolina, Jodeci began as a duo of DeVanté Swing and JoJo but later each added their brothers. After signing with Uptown Records in 1990, the group finished work on their debut album, &quot;Forever My Lady&quot; (1991), which brought them mainstream success with three straight &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B No. 1 hit singles: the album&#x27;s titular track, &quot;Stay&quot; and &quot;Come and Talk to Me&quot;.

The group&#x27;s critical and commercial success continued with the releases of &quot;Diary of a Mad Band&quot; (1993), which includes the &quot;Billboard&quot; hit singles &quot;Cry for You&quot; and &quot;Feenin&#x27;&quot;, and &quot;The Show, the After Party, the Hotel&quot; (1995), which includes the additional &quot;Billboard&quot; hit singles &quot;Freek&#x27;n You&quot;, &quot;Love U 4 Life&quot;, and &quot;Get On Up&quot;. The group experimented with various musical styles typically not associated with traditional R&amp;B. Jodeci would incorporate hip hop soul, gospel and new jack swing into their music, which led to the group featured prominently with hip hop artists during the 1990s. Each album released by the group during this period attained platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and helped to redefine the genre, allowing for developments in thematic and musical content within R&amp;B.

In 1996, they announced a hiatus – though continuing to work on music as a group – which prompted K-Ci &amp; JoJo to branch off as a duo, releasing five albums until 2013, when the group re-united for their fourth studio album, &quot;The Past, the Present, the Future&quot; (2015). Jodeci has sold more than 20 million records worldwide to date. &quot;Complex&quot; magazine ranks the group 1st on their &quot;1990s Male R&amp;B Group Pyramid of Excellence&quot; list in 2014, one of the most influential groups of the 1990s, and the best R&amp;B group of all time.

== History ==
=== 1983–1991: Early beginnings and formation ===
Raised in extremely religious Pentecostal families, K-Ci and JoJo – then known as Little Cedric &amp; the Hailey Singers – originally performed and recorded as a gospel group, releasing three albums; &quot;Jesus Saves&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Alright Now&quot;, and &quot;God&#x27;s Blessings&quot;. K-Ci would later draw comparisons to Michael Jackson during his gospel career. Separately, Mr. Dalvin and DeVanté Swing performed and toured in their own family&#x27;s gospel group called the Degrate Delegation. The studio is where the duos later made acquaintances through relationships the members were in at the time. In a 2011 interview, Dalvin stated, &quot;there was this girl gospel group called UNITY and then the Don DeGrate Delegation, which Devanté and I played in. So we met some of the girls from UNITY and [one] was dating K-Ci before we even met [and she] would always tell us that we need to meet K-Ci and JoJo.&quot; A short time after meeting, the brothers started living together after leaving their families to pursue musical careers.

At 16, DeVanté Swing traveled to Minneapolis, hoping to visit Paisley Park in order to audition to Prince. Swing would later say, &quot;I was up at Paisley Park every day begging for a job, asking people to listen to my tape. The receptionist kept saying she couldn&#x27;t help me&quot;. The rejection motivated Swing to relocate back to North Carolina, and work to improve his songwriting and production skills. Upon arriving, Swing continued to record with the group&#x27;s additional members, eventually forming Jodeci, and began work on a demo tape to present to label executives. The name Jodeci is an abbreviation of all the members names. &quot;Jo&quot; comes from JoJo, &quot;De&quot; comes from the last name of the DeGrate brothers, and Ci comes from K-Ci.

The members soon drove to New York City with a 29-song, 3 tape demo, anticipating a signing deal with upstart Uptown Records. Upon arriving to New York, and without the knowledge of the whereabouts of the MCA subsidiary, the group used a phone book to find the company&#x27;s address, located on Clinton Street in Brooklyn. Swing later commented on the signing, &quot;we didn&#x27;t have an appointment but I knew what Uptown was, and I wanted us to be there.&quot; The group was quickly denied an audition until Andre Harrell agreed to hear the demo. In skepticism of the high quality production, Harrell requested the group to perform, where they performed &quot;Come and Talk to Me&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Still Waiting&quot;, in the presence of Jeff Redd. Hip hop artist Heavy D overheard the performance and consulted Harrell, eventually taking the group out to dinner and awarding them a recording contract.

Jodeci was assigned to Uptown intern Sean Combs, who took on the task of developing the new act. Counteracting the refined styles prominent in R&amp;B showcased by New Edition and Boyz II Men, Mr. Dalvin created the group&#x27;s image. Combs helped get the image through to Andre Harrell, perpetuating hip-hop fashion, such as baseball caps and Timberland boots, to the group in order to establish a different aesthetic in the genre. The group was introduced after providing background vocals on the 1990 song &quot;Treat Them Like They Want to Be Treated&quot;, and performed live on &quot;Soul Train&quot; on June 11, 1991.

=== 1990–1995: &quot;Forever My Lady&quot;, &quot;Diary of a Mad Band&quot;, and &quot;The Show, the After Party, the Hotel&quot; ===
Landing a recording deal in 1990, the group released their debut album &quot;Forever My Lady&quot; the next year. Writer Ronin Ro maintained, &quot;They no longer resembled gospel singers… Puffy also asked them to build their mystique by posing for photos with their backs to the camera, which he borrowed from Guy&#x27;s stage show.&quot; The album&#x27;s seductive energy showcased DeVanté&#x27;s songwriting, establishing a uniqueness in his production that mixed old-fashioned soul singing with New Jack Swing, creating a production of great boldness. It featured the number 1 R&amp;B singles &quot;Forever My Lady,&quot; &quot;Stay,&quot; and &quot;Come and Talk to Me.&quot; Mr. Dalvin recalls how the album &quot;Forever My Lady&quot; was created, &quot;The last version of the album that was released only took us a week to finish because we had already written the songs. It was about getting our sounds right because the vocals were already done. It was us going back in the studio recreating the beats and the melodies... Most of the songs were written before we left North Carolina. My brother was 16 and I was 14 when we wrote the songs...&quot; The album went on to sell over three million copies.

In 1993, a minor feud resulted over the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Diary of a Mad Band&quot;; Jodeci, unhappy with their treatment by Uptown, flirted with the idea of leaving for Death Row Records, which resulted in almost zero promotion for the album. Reaching number 3 on the Billboard 200 and number-one on the R&amp;B album chart, where it stayed for two weeks, spawning the #1 R&amp;B hit &quot;Cry for You&quot;; &quot;Feenin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;What About Us&quot;, &quot;Diary of a Mad Band&quot; eventually went double platinum. Jodeci also covered &quot;Lately&quot;, a Stevie Wonder song, for the &quot;Uptown MTV Unplugged&quot; release in 1993. The group&#x27;s version of the song was released as a promotional single, claiming the number one spot on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp; Tracks chart as the group&#x27;s fourth number one R&amp;B hit. It was also Jodeci&#x27;s highest peaking pop hit, reaching number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in August 1993. It sold 900,000 copies and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. A studio version of the song was included on &quot;Diary of a Mad Band&quot;.

Jodeci&#x27;s third album, &quot;The Show, the After Party, the Hotel&quot;, was released in July 1995, reaching the second spot on the Billboard 200 making it the group&#x27;s highest-peaking release and topping the U.S. R&amp;B Albums chart. By September 1995, it was certified platinum in sales by the RIAA, after sales exceeding one million copies in the United States. The album contained the Top 40 hits &quot;Freek&#x27;n You&quot;, &quot;Love U 4 Life&quot; and &quot;Get on Up&quot;.

=== 2014–present: Return and &quot;The Past, the Present, the Future&quot; ===
In February 2014, Timbaland revealed that he was in the process of working with Jodeci on their comeback album.

On November 7, 2014, Jodeci reunited and performed a medley of their classic songs at the 2014 Soul Train Awards. The performance also included a snippet of a brand-new single titled &quot;Nobody Wins,&quot; which was released on December 22, 2014. The song is the first single released by Jodeci in over 18 years. The last song released by the group was &quot;Get on Up&quot;, in 1996. Prior to the performance, the group had not taken the stage together in the U.S. since 2006.

On January 28, 2015, a second single titled &quot;Every Moment&quot; was released. Also in that same month, it was announced by Epic Records that Jodeci had been signed to the label to release their new album. Timbaland, who recently brought his Mosley Music Group over to Epic, worked on the album. Their fourth album, &quot;The Past, the Present, the Future&quot;, was released on March 31, 2015. It was their first album in 20 years.

Shortly after the album&#x27;s release, a Jodeci reunion tour was announced. The first show took place on June 6, 2015, in Richmond, Virginia, as a part of the city&#x27;s 11th annual Stone Soul Music Festival. Jodeci headlined the event, marking the group&#x27;s first official concert performance together in the United States since 1995.

<text>Extended Display Identification Data (EDID) and Enhanced EDID (E-EDID) are metadata formats for display devices to describe their capabilities to a video source (e.g., graphics card or set-top box). The data format is defined by a standard published by the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA).

The EDID data structure includes manufacturer name and serial number, product type, phosphor or filter type (as chromaticity data), timings supported by the display, display size, luminance data and (for digital displays only) pixel mapping data.

DisplayID is a VESA standard targeted to replace EDID and E-EDID extensions with a uniform format suited for both PC monitor and consumer electronics devices.

==Background==
EDID structure (base block) versions range from v1.0 to v1.4; all these define upwards-compatible 128-byte structures. Version 2.0 defined a new 256-byte structure but it has been deprecated and replaced by E-EDID which supports multiple extension blocks. HDMI versions 1.0–1.3c use E-EDID v1.3.

Before Display Data Channel (DDC) and EDID were defined, there was no standard way for a graphics card to know what kind of display device it was connected to. Some VGA connectors in personal computers provided a basic form of identification by connecting one, two or three pins to ground, but this coding was not standardized.

This problem is solved by EDID and DDC, as it enables the display to send information to the graphics card it is connected to. The transmission of EDID information usually uses the Display Data Channel protocol, specifically DDC2B, which is based on I²C-bus (DDC1 used a different serial format which never gained popularity). The data is transmitted via the cable connecting the display and the graphics card; VGA, DVI, DisplayPort and HDMI are supported.

The EDID is often stored in the monitor in the firmware chip called serial EEPROM (electrically erasable programmable read-only memory) and is accessible via the I²C-bus at address . The EDID PROM can often be read by the host PC even if the display itself is turned off.

Many software packages can read and display the EDID information, such as read-edid for Linux and DOS, PowerStrip for Microsoft Windows and the X.Org Server for Linux and BSD unix. Mac OS X natively reads EDID information and programs such as SwitchResX or DisplayConfigX can display the information as well as use it to define custom resolutions.

E-EDID was introduced at the same time as E-DDC, which supports multiple extensions blocks and deprecated EDID version 2.0 structure (it can be incorporated in E-EDID as an optional extension block). Data fields for preferred timing, range limits, and monitor name are required in E-EDID. E-EDID also adds support for the Dual GTF curve concept and partially changed the encoding of aspect ratio within the standard timings.

With the use of extensions, E-EDID structure can be extended up to 32 KiB, because the E-DDC added the capability to address multiple (up to 128) 256 byte segments.

===EDID Extensions assigned by VESA===
*Timing Extension ()
*Additional Timing Data Block (CTA EDID Timing Extension) ()
*Video Timing Block Extension (VTB-EXT) ()
*EDID 2.0 Extension ()

==Revision history==
*August 1994, DDC standard version 1 – introduce EDID v1.0.
*April 1996, EDID standard version 2 – introduce EDID v1.1.
*November 1997, EDID standard version 3 – introduce EDID v1.2 and EDID v2.0.
*September 1999, E-EDID Standard Release A – introduce EDID v1.3 and E-EDID v1.0, which supports multiple extensions blocks.
*February 2000, E-EDID Standard Release A - introduce E-EDID v1.3 (used in HDMI), based on EDID v1.3. EDID v2.0 deprecated.
*September 2006, E-EDID Standard Release A – introduce E-EDID v1.4, based on EDID v1.4.

==Limitations==
Some graphics card drivers have historically coped poorly with the EDID, using only its standard timing descriptors rather than its Detailed Timing Descriptors (DTDs). Even in cases where the DTDs were read, the drivers are/were still often limited by the standard timing descriptor limitation that the horizontal/vertical resolutions must be evenly divisible by 8. This means that many graphics cards cannot express the native resolutions of the most common widescreen flat-panel displays and liquid-crystal display TVs. The number of vertical pixels is calculated from the horizontal resolution and the selected aspect ratio. To be fully expressible, the size of widescreen display must thus be a multiple of 16×9 pixels. For 1366×768 pixel Wide XGA panels the nearest resolution expressible in the EDID standard timing descriptor syntax is 1360×765 pixels, typically leading to 3-pixel-thin black bars. Specifying 1368 pixels as the screen width would yield an unnatural screen height of 769.5 pixels.

Many Wide XGA panels do not advertise their native resolution in the standard timing descriptors, instead offering only a resolution of 1280×768. Some panels advertise a resolution only slightly smaller than the native, such as 1360×765. For these panels to be able to show a pixel perfect image, the EDID data must be ignored by the display driver or the driver must correctly interpret the DTD and be able to resolve resolutions whose size is not divisible by 8. Special programs are available to override the standard timing descriptors from EDID data. Even this is not always possible, as some vendors&#x27; graphics drivers (notably those of Intel) require specific registry hacks to implement custom resolutions, which can make it very difficult to use the screen&#x27;s native resolution.

==CTA EDID Timing Extension Block ==

The CTA EDID Extension was first introduced in EIA/CEA-861.

===CTA-861 Standard===

The ANSI/CTA-861 industry standard, which according to CTA is now their &quot;Most Popular Standard&quot;, has since been updated several times, most notably with the 861-B revision (published in May 2002, which added version 3 of the extension, adding Short Video Descriptors and advanced audio capability/configuration information), 861-D (published in July 2006 and containing updates to the audio segments), 861-E in March 2008, 861-F, which was published on June 4, 2013, 861-H in December 2020, and, most recently, 861-I, which was published in February 2023. Coinciding with the publication of CEA-861-F in 2013, Brian Markwalter, senior vice president, research and standards, stated: &quot;The new edition includes a number of noteworthy enhancements, including support for several new Ultra HD and widescreen video formats and additional colorimetry schemes.”

Version CTA-861-G, originally published in November 2016, was made available for free in November 2017, along with updated versions -E and -F, after some necessary changes due to a trademark complaint. All CTA standards are free to everyone since May 2018.

The most recent full version is CTA-861-I, published in February 2023, available for free after registration. It combines the previous version, CTA-861-H, from January 2021 with an amendment, CTA-861.6, published in February 2022 and includes a new formula to calculate Video Timing Formats, OVT. Other changes include a new annex to elaborate on the audio speaker room configuration system that was introduced with the 861.2 amendment, and some general clarifications and formatting cleanup.

An amendment to CTA-861-I, CTA-861.7, was published in June 2024. It contains updates to CTA 3D Audio, and clarifications on Content Type Indication, and on 4:2:0 support for VTDBs and VFDBs. It also introduces a new Product ID Data Block, to replace the Manufacturer PNP ID in the first block of the EDID, since the UEFI is phasing out assigning new PNP IDs.

===CTA Extension Block===

Version 1 of the extension block (as defined in CEA−861) allowed the specification of video timings only through the use of 18-byte Detailed Timing Descriptors (DTD) (as detailed in EDID 1.3 data format above). DTD timings are listed in order of preference in the CEA EDID Timing Extension.

Version 2 (as defined in 861-A) added the capability to designate a number of DTDs as &quot;native&quot; (i.e., matching the resolution of the display) and also included some &quot;basic discovery&quot; functionality for whether the display device contains support for &quot;basic audio&quot;, YCBCR pixel formats, and underscan.

Version 3 (from the 861-B spec onward) allows two different ways to specify digital video timing formats: As in Version 1 &amp; 2 by the use of 18-byte DTDs, or by the use of the Short Video Descriptor (SVD) (see below). HDMI 1.0–1.3c uses this version.

Version 3 also defines a format for a collection of data blocks, which in turn can contain a number of individual descriptors. This Data Block Collection (DBC) initially had four types of Data Blocks (DBs): Video Data Blocks containing the aforementioned Short Video Descriptor (SVD), Audio Data Blocks containing Short Audio Descriptors (SAD), Speaker Allocation Data Blocks containing information about the speaker configuration of the display device, and Vendor Specific Data Blocks which can contain information specific to a given vendor&#x27;s use. Subsequent versions of CTA-861 defined additional data blocks.

===CTA Extension data format===

The Data Block Collection contains one or more data blocks detailing video, audio, and speaker placement information about the display. The blocks can be placed in any order, and the initial byte of each block defines both its type and its length:

If the Tag code is 7, an Extended Tag Code is present in the first payload byte of the data block, and the second payload byte represents the first payload byte of the extended data block.

Once one data block has ended, the next byte is assumed to be the beginning of the next data block. This is the case until the byte (designated in byte 2, above) where the DTDs are known to begin.

=== CTA Data Blocks ===

As noted, several data blocks are defined by the extension.

==== Video Data Blocks ====

The Video Data Blocks will contain one or more 1-byte Short Video Descriptors (SVDs).
===== EIA/CEA-861 predefined standard resolutions and timings =====

Notes: Parentheses indicate instances where pixels are repeated to meet the minimum speed requirements of the interface. For example, in the 720x240p case, the pixels on each line are double-clocked. In the (2880)x480i case, the number of pixels on each line, and thus the number of times that they are repeated, is variable, and is sent to the DTV monitor by the source device.

Increased Hactive expressions include “2x” and “4x” indicate two and four times the reference resolution, respectively.

Video modes with vertical refresh frequency being a multiple of 6Hz (i.e. 24, 30, 60, 120, and 240Hz) are considered to be the same timing as equivalent NTSC modes where vertical refresh is adjusted by a factor of 1000/1001. As VESA DMT specifies 0.5% pixel clock tolerance, which 5 times more than the required change, pixel clocks can be adjusted to maintain NTSC compatibility; typically, 240p, 480p, and 480i modes are adjusted, while 576p, 576i and HDTV formats are not.

* The EIA/CEA-861 and 861-A standards included only numbers 1–7 and numbers 17–22 (only in -A) above (but not as short video descriptors which were introduced in EIA/CEA-861-B) and are considered primary video format timings.
* The EIA/CEA-861-B standard has the first 34 short video descriptors above. It is used by HDMI 1.0–1.2a.
* The EIA/CEA-861-C and -D standards have the first 59 short video descriptors above. EIA/CEA-861-D is used by HDMI 1.3–1.3c.
* The EIA/CEA-861-E standard has the first 64 short video descriptors above. It is used by HDMI 1.4–1.4b.
* The CTA-861-F standard has the first 107 short video descriptors above. It is used by HDMI 2.0–2.0b.
* The CTA-861-G standard has the full list of 154 (1–127, 193–219) short video descriptors above. It is used by HDMI 2.1.

==== Audio Data Blocks ====

The Audio Data Blocks contain one or more 3-byte Short Audio Descriptors (SADs). Each SAD details audio format, channel number, and bitrate/resolution capabilities of the display as follows:

==== Vendor Specific Data Block ====

A Vendor Specific Data Block (if any) contains as its first three bytes the vendor&#x27;s IEEE 24-bit registration number, least significant byte first. The remainder of the Vendor Specific Data Block is the &quot;data payload&quot;, which can be anything the vendor considers worthy of inclusion in this EDID extension block. For example, IEEE registration number means this is a &quot;HDMI Licensing, LLC&quot; specific data block (contains HDMI 1.4 info), means this is a &quot;HDMI Forum&quot; specific data block (contains HDMI 2.0 info), means this is &quot;DOLBY LABORATORIES, INC.&quot; (contains Dolby Vision info) and is &quot;HDR10+ Technologies, LLC&quot; (contains HDR10+ info as part of HDMI 2.1 Amendment A1 standard). It starts with a two byte source physical address, least significant byte first. The source physical address provides the CEC physical address for upstream CEC devices. HDMI 1.3a specifies some requirements for the data payload.

==== Speaker Allocation Data Block ====

If a Speaker Allocation Data Block is present, it will consist of three bytes. The first and second bytes contain information about which speakers (or speaker pairs) are present in the display device:

Some speaker flags have been deprecated in the SADB, but are still available in the RCDB&#x27;s SPM. These speakers could not be indicated with a CA value in the Audio InfoFrame, and can only be used with Delivery According to the Speaker Mask, which corresponds to the RCDB only.

==== Room Configuration Data Block ====

The Room Configuration Data Block and Speaker Location Data Blocks describe the speaker setup using room coordinates.

<doc id="239456" wikidata="Q763591" url="?curid=239456" title="Quality function deployment">
<text>Quality function deployment (QFD) is a method developed in Japan beginning in 1966 to help transform the voice of the customer into engineering characteristics for a product. Yoji Akao, the original developer, described QFD as a &quot;method to transform qualitative user demands into quantitative parameters, to deploy the functions forming quality, and to deploy methods for achieving the design quality into subsystems and component parts, and ultimately to specific elements of the manufacturing process.&quot; The author combined his work in quality assurance and quality control points with function deployment used in value engineering.

== House of quality ==
The house of quality, a part of QFD, is the basic design tool of quality function deployment. It identifies and classifies customer desires (WHATs), identifies the importance of those desires, identifies engineering characteristics which may be relevant to those desires (HOWs), correlates the two, allows for verification of those correlations, and then assigns objectives and priorities for the system requirements. This process can be applied at any system composition level (e.g. system, subsystem, or component) in the design of a product, and can allow for assessment of different abstractions of a system. It is intensely progressed through a number of hierarchical levels of WHATs and HOWs and analyse each stage of product growth (service enhancement), and production (service delivery).

The house of quality appeared in 1972 in the design of an oil tanker by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.
The output of the house of quality is generally a matrix with customer desires on one dimension and correlated nonfunctional requirements on the other dimension. The cells of matrix table are filled with the weights assigned to the stakeholder characteristics where those characteristics are affected by the system parameters across the top of the matrix. At the bottom of the matrix, the column is summed, which allows for the system characteristics to be weighted according to the stakeholder characteristics. System parameters not correlated to stakeholder characteristics may be unnecessary to the system design and are identified by empty matrix columns, while stakeholder characteristics (identified by empty rows) not correlated to system parameters indicate &quot;characteristics not addressed by the design parameters&quot;. System parameters and stakeholder characteristics with weak correlations potentially indicate missing information, while matrices with &quot;too many correlations&quot; indicate that the stakeholder needs may need to be refined.

== Fuzziness ==
The concepts of fuzzy logic have been applied to QFD (&quot;Fuzzy QFD&quot; or &quot;FQFD&quot;). A review of 59 papers in 2013 by Abdolshah and Moradi found a number of conclusions: most FQFD &quot;studies were focused on quantitative methods&quot; to construct a house of quality matrix based on customer requirements, where the most-employed techniques were based on multiple-criteria decision analysis methods. They noted that there are factors other than the house of quality relevant to product development, and called metaheuristic methods &quot;a promising approach for solving complicated problems of FQFD.&quot;

== Derived techniques and tools ==
The process of quality function deployment (QFD) is described in ISO 16355-1:2021.
Pugh concept selection can be used in coordination with QFD to select a promising product or service configuration from among listed alternatives.

Modular function deployment uses QFD to establish customer requirements and to identify important design requirements with a special emphasis on modularity. There are three main differences to QFD as applied in modular function deployment compared to house of quality: The benchmarking data is mostly gone; the checkboxes and crosses have been replaced with circles, and the triangular &quot;roof&quot; is missing.

<doc id="239457" wikidata="Q1300742" url="?curid=239457" title="Battle of Flodden">
<text>The Battle of Flodden, Flodden Field, or occasionally Branxton or Brainston Moor was fought on 9 September 1513 during the War of the League of Cambrai between the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland and resulted in an English victory. The battle was fought near Branxton, in the county of Northumberland, in northern England, between an invading Scots army under King James IV and an English army commanded by the Earl of Surrey. In terms of troop numbers, it was the largest battle ever fought between the two kingdoms.

After besieging and capturing several English border castles, James encamped his invading army on a commanding hilltop position at Flodden, awaited the English force that had been sent against him and declined a challenge to fight in an open field. Surrey&#x27;s army, therefore, carried out a circuitous march to position themselves in the rear of the Scottish camp. The Scots countered that by abandoning their camp and occupying the adjacent Branxton Hill and denying it to the English.

The battle began with an artillery duel followed by a downhill advance by Scottish infantry armed with pikes. Unknown to the Scots, an area of marshy land lay in their path, which had the effect of breaking up their formations. That gave the English troops the chance to bring about a close-quarter battle for which they were better equipped. James IV was killed in the fighting and became the last monarch from Great Britain to die in battle. That and the loss of a large proportion of the nobility led to a political crisis in Scotland.

British historians sometimes use the Battle of Flodden to mark the end of the Middle Ages in the British Isles; another candidate is the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485.

Centuries of intermittent warfare between England and Scotland had been formally brought to an end by the Treaty of Perpetual Peace which was signed in 1502. However, relations were soon soured by repeated cross-border raids, rivalry at sea leading to the death of the Scottish privateer Andrew Barton and the capture of his ships in 1511, and increasingly bellicose rhetoric by King Henry VIII of England in claiming to be the overlord of Scotland. Conflict began when James IV, King of Scots, declared war on England to honour the Auld Alliance with France by diverting Henry&#x27;s English troops from their campaign against the French king, Louis XII. At this time, England was involved as a member of the &quot;Catholic League&quot; in the War of the League of Cambrai, defending Italy and the Pope from the French, a part of the Italian Wars.

Pope Leo X, already a signatory to the anti-French Treaty of Mechlin, sent a letter to James threatening him with ecclesiastical censure for breaking his peace treaties with England on 28 June 1513, and subsequently James was excommunicated by Cardinal Christopher Bainbridge. James also summoned sailors and sent the Scottish navy, including the &quot;Great Michael&quot;, to join the ships of Louis XII of France. The fleet of twenty-two vessels commanded by James Hamilton, 1st Earl of Arran, departed from the Firth of Forth on 25 July accompanied by James as far as the Isle of May, intending to pass around the north of Scotland and create a diversion in Ireland before joining the French at Brest, from where it might cut the English line of communication across the English Channel. However, the fleet was so badly delayed that it played no part in the war; unfortunately, James had sent most of his experienced artillerymen with the expedition, a decision which was to have unforeseen consequences for his land campaign.

Henry was in France with the Emperor Maximilian at the siege of Thérouanne. The Scottish Lyon King of Arms brought James IV&#x27;s letter of 26 July to him. James asked him to desist from attacking France in breach of their treaty. Henry&#x27;s exchange with Islay Herald or the Lyon King on 11 August at his tent at the siege was recorded. The Herald declared that Henry should abandon his efforts against the town and go home. Angered, Henry said that James had no right to summon him, and ought to be England&#x27;s ally, as James was married to his (Henry&#x27;s) sister, Margaret. He declared:And now, for a conclusion, recommend me to your master and tell him if he be so hardy to invade my realm or cause to enter one foot of my ground I shall make him as weary of his part as ever was man that began any such business. And one thing I ensure him by the faith that I have to the Crown of England and by the word of a King, there shall never King nor Prince make peace with me that ever his part shall be in it. Moreover, fellow, I care for nothing but for misentreating of my sister, that would God she were in England on a condition she cost the Schottes King not a penny.

Henry also replied by letter on 12 August, writing that James was mistaken and that any of his attempts on England would be resisted. Using the pretext of revenge for the murder of Robert Kerr, a Warden of the Scottish East March who had been killed by John &quot;The Bastard&quot; Heron in 1508, James invaded England with an army of about 30,000 men. However, both sides had been making lengthy preparations for this conflict. Henry VIII had already organised an army and artillery in the north of England to counter the expected invasion. Some of the guns had been returned to use against the Scots by Margaret of Austria, Duchess of Savoy. A year earlier, Thomas Howard, Earl of Surrey, had been appointed Lieutenant-General of the army of the north and was issued with banners of the Cross of St George and the Red Dragon of Wales. Only a small number of the light horsemen of the Scottish border had been sent to France. A northern army was maintained with artillery and its expense account started on 21 July. The first captains were recruited in Lambeth. Many of these soldiers wore green and white Tudor colours. Surrey marched to Doncaster in July and then Pontefract, where he assembled more troops from northern England.

===&quot;Ill Raid&quot;===
On 5 August, a force estimated at up to 7,000 Scottish border reivers commanded by Lord Home, crossed into Northumberland and began to pillage farms and villages, taking anything of value before burning the houses. Surrey had taken the precaution of sending Sir William Bulmer north with 200 mounted archers, which Bulmer augmented with locally levied men to create a force approaching 1,000 in strength. On 13 August, they prepared an ambush for the Scots as they returned north laden with the spoils of their looting, by hiding in the broom bushes that grew shoulder-high on Milfield Plain. Surprising the Scots with a sudden volley of arrows, the English killed as many as 600 of the Scots before they were able to escape, leaving their booty and the Home family banner behind them. Although the &quot;Ill Raid&quot; had little effect on the forthcoming campaign, it may have influenced James&#x27;s decision not to fight an open battle against Surrey on the same ground. Whether the raid was undertaken solely on Lord Home&#x27;s initiative, or whether it had been authorised by James is unknown.

== Invasion ==

On 18 August, five cannons brought down from Edinburgh Castle to the Netherbow Port at St Mary&#x27;s Wynd for the invasion set off towards England dragged by borrowed oxen. On 19 August two &quot;gross culverins&quot;, four &quot;culverins pickmoyance&quot; and six (mid-sized) &quot;culverins moyane&quot; followed with the gunner Robert Borthwick and master carpenter John Drummond. The king himself set off that night with two hastily prepared standards of St Margaret and St Andrew.

Catherine of Aragon was regent in England. On 27 August, she issued warrants for the property of all Scotsmen in England to be seized. On hearing of the invasion on 3 September, she ordered Thomas Lovell to raise an army in the Midland counties. She prepared banners for an army, including her heraldry, in case she herself was called north.

In keeping with his understanding of the medieval code of chivalry, King James sent notice to the English, one month in advance, of his intent to invade. This gave the English time to gather an army. After a muster on the Burgh Muir of Edinburgh, the Scottish host moved to Ellemford, to the north of Duns, Scottish Borders, and camped to wait for Angus and Home. The Scottish army, numbering some 42,000 men, crossed the River Tweed into England near Coldstream; the exact date of the crossing is not recorded, but is generally accepted to have been 22 August. The Scottish troops were unpaid and were only required by feudal obligation to serve for forty days. Once across the border, a detachment turned south to attack Wark on Tweed Castle, while the bulk of the army followed the course of the Tweed downstream to the northeast to invest the remaining border castles.
On 24 August, James IV held a council or parliament at Twiselhaugh and made a proclamation for the benefit of the heirs of anyone killed during this invasion. By 29 August after a siege of six days, Bishop Thomas Ruthall&#x27;s Norham Castle was taken and partly demolished after the Scottish heavy artillery had breached the recently refurbished outer walls. The Scots then moved south, capturing the castles of Etal and Ford.
A later Scottish chronicle writer, Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie, tells the story that James wasted valuable time at Ford enjoying the company of Elizabeth, Lady Heron and her daughter. Edward Hall says that Lady Heron was a prisoner (in Scotland), and negotiated with James IV and the Earl of Surrey her own release and that Ford Castle would not be demolished for an exchange of prisoners. The English herald, Rouge Croix, came to Ford to appoint a place for battle on 4 September, with extra instructions that any Scottish heralds who were sent to Surrey were to be met where they could not view the English forces. Raphael Holinshed&#x27;s story is that a part of the Scottish army returned to Scotland, and the rest stayed at Ford waiting for Norham to surrender and debating their next move. James IV wanted to fight and considered moving to assault Berwick-upon-Tweed, but the Earl of Angus spoke against this and said that Scotland had done enough for France. James sent Angus home, and according to Holinshed, the Earl burst into tears and left, leaving his two sons, the Master of Angus and Glenbervie, with most of the Douglas kindred to fight.

In the meantime, Surrey was reluctant to commit his army too early, since once in the field they had to be paid and fed at enormous expense. From his encampment at Pontefract, he issued an order for forces raised in the northern counties to assemble at Newcastle on Tyne on 1 September. Surrey had 500 soldiers with him and was to be joined at Newcastle by 1,000 experienced soldiers and sailors with their artillery, who would arrive by sea under the command of Surrey&#x27;s son, also called Thomas Howard, the Lord High Admiral of England. By 28 August, Surrey had arrived at Durham Cathedral where he was presented with the banner of Saint Cuthbert, which had been carried by the English in victories against the Scots in 1138 and 1346. On 3 September, Surrey moved his advanced guard to Alnwick while he awaited the completion of the muster and the arrival of the Lord Admiral whose ships had been delayed by storms.

===Surrey&#x27;s challenge===

On Sunday 4 September, James and the Scottish army had taken up a position at Flodden Edge, a hill to the south of Branxton. This was an immensely strong natural feature since the flanks were protected by marshes on one side and steep slopes on the other, leaving only a direct approach. The amount of fortification which James constructed on the hill is disputed; several antiquaries had mapped supposed ramparts and bastions there over the centuries, but excavations conducted between 2009 and 2015 found no trace of 16th century work and concluded that James may have reused some features of an Iron Age hill fort.

The Earl of Surrey, writing at Wooler Haugh on Wednesday 7 September, compared this position to a fortress in a challenge sent to James IV by his herald, Thomas Hawley, the Rouge Croix Pursuivant. Surrey complained that James had sent his Islay Herald, agreeing that they would join in battle on Friday between 12 noon and 3 pm, and asked that James would face him on the plain at Milfield as appointed. James had no intention of leaving his carefully prepared position, perhaps recalling the fate of the Ill Raid on the same plain; he replied to Surrey that it was &quot;not fitting for an Earl to seek to command a King&quot;. This put Surrey in a difficult position; the choice was to make a frontal attack on Flodden Edge, uphill in the face of the Scottish guns in their prepared position and in all probability be defeated, or to refuse battle, earning disgrace and the anger of King Henry. Waiting for James to make a move was not an option because his 20,000-26,000 strong army desperately needed resupply, the convoy of wagons bringing food and beer for the troops from Newcastle having been ambushed and looted by local Englishmen. During a council of war on Wednesday evening, an ingenious alternative plan was devised, advised by &quot;the Bastard&quot; Heron, who had intimate local knowledge and had recently arrived at the English camp.

==Battle==
===Initial manoeuvres===

On Thursday, 8 September, Surrey moved his army from Wooler Haugh and instead of heading northwest towards Flodden, he turned east across the River Till. From there, the English picked up the old Roman road known as the Devil&#x27;s Causeway and headed north, making camp at Barmoor, near Lowick. James may have assumed that Surrey was heading for Berwick-upon-Tweed for resupply, but he was actually intending to outflank the Scots and either attack or blockade them from the rear. At 5 am on the morning of Friday, 9 September, after a damp night on short rations and having to drink water from streams because the beer had run out, Surrey&#x27;s men set off westwards to complete their manoeuvre. Their objective was Branxton Hill, lying less than north of James&#x27;s camp at Flodden. To re-cross the River Till, the English army split into two; one force under Surrey crossed several fords near Heaton Castle, while a larger vanguard numbering some 15,000 commanded by the Lord Admiral and including the artillery train, crossed at Twizell Bridge downstream.

Pitscottie says the vanguard crossed the bridge at 11 am and that James would not allow the Scots artillery to fire on the vulnerable English during this manoeuvre. This is not credible, since the bridge is some distant from Flodden, but James&#x27;s scouts must have reported their approach. James quickly saw the threat and ordered his army to break camp and move to Branxton Hill, a commanding position which would deny the feature to the English and still give his pike formations the advantage of a downhill attack if the opportunity arose. The disadvantage was that the Scots were moving onto ground that had not been reconnoitred. The Lord Admiral, arriving with his vanguard at Branxton village, was unaware of the new Scottish position which was obscured by smoke from burning rubbish; when he finally caught sight of the Scottish army arrayed on Branxton Hill, he sent a messenger to his father urging him to hurry and also sending his Agnus Dei pendant to underline the gravity of his situation. In the meantime, he positioned his troops on the dead ground from where he hoped that the Scots could not assess the size of his force. James declined to attack the vulnerable vanguard, reportedly saying that he was &quot;determined to have them all in front of me on one plain field and see what all of them can do against me&quot;.

===Opposing forces===

James&#x27; army, somewhat reduced from the original 42,000 by sickness and desertion, still amounted to about 34,000, outnumbering the English force by 8,000. The Scottish army was organised into four divisions or battles. That on the left wing was commanded by the Lord Home and the Earl of Huntly and consisted of a combination of Borderers and Highlanders. Next in the line was the battle commanded by the Earls of Erroll, Crawford and Montrose composed of men from the northeast of Scotland. The third was commanded by James himself together with his son Alexander and the Earls of Cassillis, Rothes and Caithness. On the right, the Earls of Argyll and Lennox commanded a force drawn from the Highlands and Islands. Some sources state that there was a fifth battle acting as a reserve, perhaps commanded by the Earl of Bothwell. The Scottish infantry had been equipped with long pikes by their French allies; a new weapon which had proved devastating in continental Europe, but required training, discipline and suitable terrain to use effectively. The Scottish artillery, consisting mainly of heavy siege guns, included five great curtals and two great culverins (known as &quot;the Seven Sisters&quot;), together with four sakers, and six great serpentines. These modern weapons fired an iron ball weighing up to to a range of . However, the heaviest of these required a team of 36 oxen to move each one and were only able to fire once every twenty minutes at the most. They were commanded by the king&#x27;s secretary, Patrick Paniter, an able diplomat, but who had no artillery experience.

Upon Surrey&#x27;s arrival, he deployed his troops on the forward slope of Piper Hill to match the Scottish dispositions. On his right, facing Hume and Huntly, was a battle composed of men from Cheshire, Lancashire and Yorkshire, commanded by Surrey&#x27;s third son, Lord Edmund Howard. Of the central battles, one was commanded by the Lord Admiral and the other by Surrey himself. Sir Edward Stanley&#x27;s force of cavalry and archers had been the last to leave Barmoor and would not arrive on the left flank until later in the day. A reserve of mounted Borderers commanded by Thomas, Baron Dacre were positioned to the rear. The English infantry was equipped with traditional polearms, mostly bills which were their favoured weapon. There was also a large contingent of well-trained archers armed with the English longbow. The English artillery consisted of light field guns of rather old-fashioned design, typically firing a ball of only about , but they were easily handled and capable of rapid fire.
===Engagement===
At about 4 pm on Friday in wet and windy weather, James began the battle with an artillery duel, but his big guns did not perform as well as he had hoped. Contemporary accounts put this down to the difficulty for the Scots of shooting downhill, but another factor must have been that their guns had been poorly sited instead of being carefully emplaced, which was usually required for such heavy weapons, further slowing their ponderous rate of fire. This may explain English claims that the Scottish guns were destroyed by return fire, when in fact they were captured undamaged after the battle. The apparent silence of the Scottish artillery allowed the light English guns to turn a rapid fire on the massed ranks of infantry, although the effectiveness of this bombardment is difficult to assess.

The next phase started when Home and Huntly&#x27;s battle on the Scottish left advanced downhill towards the opposite troops commanded by Edmund Howard. They advanced, according to the English, &quot;in good order, after the Alamayns [i.e. German] manner, without speaking a word&quot;. The Scots had placed their most heavily armoured men in the front rank so that the English archers had little impact. The outnumbered English battle was forced back and elements of it began to run off. Surrey saved his son from disaster by ordering the intervention of Dacre&#x27;s light horsemen, who were able to approach unobserved in the dead ground that had been exploited earlier by the vanguard. The eventual result was a stalemate in which both sides stood off from each other and played no further part in the battle. According to later accounts, when Huntly suggested that they rejoin the fighting, Home replied: &quot;the man does well this day who saves himself: we fought those who were opposed to us and beat them; let our other companies do the same!&quot;.

In the meantime, James had observed Home and Huntly&#x27;s initial success and ordered the advance of the next battle in line, commanded by Errol, Crawford and Montrose. At the foot of Branxton Hill, they encountered an unforeseen obstacle, an area of marshy ground, identified by modern hydrologists as a groundwater seepage zone, made worse by days of heavy rain. As they struggled to cross the waterlogged ground, the Scots lost the cohesion and momentum on which pike formations depended for success. Once the line was disrupted, the long pikes became an unwieldy encumbrance, and the Scots began to drop them &quot;so that it seemed as if a wood were falling down&quot; according to a later English poem. Reaching for their side-arms of swords and axes, they found themselves outreached by the English bills in the close-quarter fighting that developed. 

It is unclear whether James had seen the difficulty encountered by the battle of the three earls, but he followed them down the slope regardless, making for Surrey&#x27;s formation. James has been criticised for placing himself in the front line, thereby putting himself in personal danger and losing his overview of the field. He was, however, well-known for taking risks in battle and it would have been out of character for him to stay back. Encountering the same difficulties as the previous attack, James&#x27;s men nevertheless fought their way to Surrey&#x27;s bodyguard but no further. The final uncommitted Scottish formation, Argyll and Lennox&#x27;s Highlanders held back, perhaps awaiting orders. The last English formation to engage was Stanley&#x27;s force which, after following a circuitous route from Barmoor, finally arrived on the right of the Scottish line. They loosed volleys of arrows into Argyll and Lennox&#x27;s battle, whose men lacked armour or any other effective defence against the archers. After suffering heavy casualties the Highlanders scattered.

The fierce fighting continued, centred on the contest between Surrey and James. As other English formations overcame the Scottish forces they had initially engaged, they moved to reinforce their leader. An instruction to English troops that no prisoners were to be taken explains the exceptional mortality amongst the Scottish nobility. James himself was killed in the final stage of the battle; his body was found surrounded by the corpses of his bodyguard of the Archers&#x27; Guard, recruited from the Forest of Ettrick and known as &quot;the Flowers of the Forest&quot;. Despite having the finest armour available, the king&#x27;s corpse was found to have two arrow wounds, one in the jaw, and wounds from bladed weapons to the neck and wrist. He was the last monarch to die in battle in the British Isles. Home, Huntly and his troops were the only formation to escape intact; others escaped in small groups, closely pursued by the English.

==Tactics and aftermath==
Soon after the battle, the council of Scotland decided to send for help from Christian II of Denmark. The Scottish ambassador, Andrew Brounhill, was given instructions to explain &quot;how this cais is hapnit.&quot; Brounhill&#x27;s instructions blame James IV for moving down the hill to attack the English on marshy ground from a favourable position, and credits the victory to Scottish inexperience rather than English valour. The letter also mentions that the Scots placed their officers in the front line in medieval style, where they were vulnerable, contrasting this loss of the nobility with the English great men who took their stand with the reserves and at the rear. The English generals stayed behind the lines in the Renaissance style. The loss of so many Scottish officers meant there was no one to coordinate a retreat.

However, according to contemporary English reports, Thomas Howard marched on foot leading the English vanguard to the foot of the hill. Howard was moved to dismount and do this by taunts of cowardice sent by James IV&#x27;s heralds, apparently based on his role at sea and the death two years earlier of the Scottish naval officer Sir Andrew Barton. A version of Howard&#x27;s declaration to James IV that he would lead the vanguard and take no prisoners was included in later English chronicle accounts of the battle. Howard claimed his presence in &quot;proper person&quot; at the front was his trial by combat for Barton&#x27;s death.

===Weaponry===
Flodden was essentially a victory of the bill used by the English over the pike used by the Scots. The pike was an effective weapon only in a battle of movement, especially to withstand a cavalry charge. The Scottish pikes were described by the author of the &quot;Trewe Encounter&quot; as &quot;keen and sharp spears 5 yards long&quot;. Although the pike had become a Swiss weapon of choice and represented modern warfare, the hilly terrain of Northumberland, the nature of the combat, and the slippery footing did not allow it to be employed to the best effect. Bishop Ruthall reported to Thomas Wolsey, &#x27;the bills disappointed the Scots of their long spears, on which they relied.&#x27; The infantrymen at Flodden, both Scots and English, had fought essentially like their ancestors, and Flodden has been described as the last great medieval battle in the British Isles. This was the last time that bill and pike would come together as equals in battle. Two years later Francis I of France defeated the Swiss pikemen at the Battle of Marignano, using a combination of heavy cavalry and artillery, ushering in a new era in the history of war. An official English diplomatic report issued by Brian Tuke noted the Scots&#x27; iron spears and their initial &quot;very good order after the German fashion&quot;, but concluded that &quot;the English halberdiers decided the whole affair, so that in the battle the bows and ordnance were of little use.&quot;

Despite Tuke&#x27;s comment (he was not present), this battle was one of the first major engagements in the British Isles where artillery was significantly deployed. John Lesley, writing sixty years later, noted that the Scottish bullets flew over the English heads while the English cannon was effective: the one army placed so high and the other so low.

The Scots&#x27; advance down the hill was resisted by a hail of arrows, an incident celebrated in later English ballads. Hall says that the armoured front line was mostly unaffected; this is confirmed by the ballads which note that some few Scots were wounded in the scalp and, wrote Hall, James IV sustained a significant arrow wound. Many of the archers were recruited from Lancashire and Cheshire. Sir Richard Assheton raised one such company from Middleton, near Manchester. He rebuilt his parish church St. Leonard&#x27;s, Middleton, which contains the unique &quot;Flodden Window.&quot; It depicts and names the archers and their priest in stained glass. The window has been called the oldest known war memorial in the UK. The success of the Cheshire yeomanry, under the command of Richard Cholmeley, led to his later appointment as Lieutenant of the Tower of London.

===Honours===
As a reward for his victory, Thomas Howard was subsequently restored to the title of Duke of Norfolk, lost by his father&#x27;s support for Richard III. The arms of the Dukes of Norfolk still carry an augmentation of honour awarded on account of their ancestor&#x27;s victory at Flodden, a modified version of the Royal coat of arms of Scotland with the lower half of the lion removed and an arrow through the lion&#x27;s mouth.

At Framlingham Castle the Duke kept two silver-gilt cups engraved with the arms of James IV, which he bequeathed to Cardinal Wolsey in 1524. The Duke&#x27;s descendants presented the College of Arms with a sword, a dagger and a turquoise ring in 1681. The family tradition was either that these items belonged to James IV or were arms carried by Thomas Howard at Flodden. The sword blade is signed by the maker Maestre Domingo of Toledo. There is some doubt whether the weapons are of the correct period. The Earl of Arundel was painted by Philip Fruytiers, following Anthony van Dyck&#x27;s 1639 composition, with his ancestor&#x27;s sword, gauntlet and helm from Flodden. Thomas Lord Darcy retrieved a powder flask belonging to James IV and gave it to Henry VIII. A cross with rubies and sapphires with a gold chain worn by James and a hexagonal table salt with the figure of St Andrews on the lid were given to Henry by James Stanley, Bishop of Ely.

===Legends of a lost king===
Lord Dacre discovered the body of James IV on the battlefield. He later wrote that the Scots &quot;love me worst of any Englishman living, by reason that I fande the body of the King of Scots.&quot; The chronicle writer John Stow gave a location for the king&#x27;s death; &quot;Pipard&#x27;s Hill,&quot; now unknown, which may have been the small hill on Branxton Ridge overlooking Branxton church. Dacre took the body to Berwick-upon-Tweed, where according to Hall&#x27;s &quot;Chronicle&quot;, it was viewed by the captured Scottish courtiers William Scott and John Forman who acknowledged it was the king&#x27;s. (Forman, the king&#x27;s sergeant-porter, had been captured by Richard Assheton of Middleton.) The body was then embalmed and taken to Newcastle upon Tyne. From York, a city that James had promised to capture before Michaelmas, the body was brought to Sheen Priory near London. A payment of £12-9s-10d was made for the &quot;sertying ledying and sawdryng of the ded course of the King of Scottes&quot; and carrying it York and to Windsor.

James&#x27;s banner, sword and his cuisses (thigh-armour), were taken to the shrine of Saint Cuthbert at Durham Cathedral. Much of the armour of the Scottish casualties was sold on the field, and 350 suits of armour were taken to Nottingham Castle. A list of horses taken at the field runs to 24 pages.

Thomas Hawley, the Rouge Croix pursuivant, was first with news of the victory. He brought the &quot;rent surcoat of the King of Scots stained with blood&quot; to Catherine of Aragon at Woburn Abbey. She sent news of the victory to Henry VIII at Tournai with Hawley, and then sent John Glyn on 16 September with James&#x27;s coat (and iron gauntlets) and a detailed account of the battle written by Lord Howard. Brian Tuke mentioned in his letter to Cardinal Bainbridge that the coat was lacerated and chequered with blood. Catherine suggested Henry should use the coat as his battle-banner, and wrote she had thought to send him the body too, as Henry had sent her the Duke of Longueville, his prisoner from Thérouanne, but &quot;Englishmen&#x27;s hearts would not suffer it.&quot;

In addition to these relics, the gold crucifix worn by James IV on the field of battle, set with three balas rubies and three sapphires and containing a fragment of the True Cross, was listed in the jewel book inventory of Henry VIII in the chapel of the Tower of London.

Soon after the battle, there were legends that James IV had survived. A Scottish merchant at Tournai in October claimed to have spoken with him, and Lindsay of Pitscottie records two myths: &quot;thair cam four great men upon hors, and every ane of thame had ane wisp upoun thair spear headis, quhairby they might know one another and brought the king furth of the feild, upoun ane dun hackney,&quot; and also that the king escaped from the field but was killed between Duns and Kelso. Similarly, John Lesley adds that the body taken to England was &quot;my lord Bonhard&quot; and James was seen in Kelso after the battle and then went secretly on pilgrimage in far nations. George Buchanan reported a rumour that James IV had escaped the field, leaving his Squire of Attendance, Alexander Elphinstone, 1st Lord Elphinstone to fight on, and that the English may have mistaken Elphinstone&#x27;s body for the king.

A legend arose that James had been warned against invading England by supernatural powers. While he was praying in St Michael&#x27;s Kirk at Linlithgow, a man strangely dressed in blue had approached his desk saying his mother had told him to say James should not go to war or take the advice of women. Then before the king could reply, the man vanished. David Lindsay of the Mount and John Inglis could find no trace of him. The historian R. L. Mackie wondered if the incident really happened as a masquerade orchestrated by an anti-war party: Norman Macdougall doubts if there was a significant anti-war faction. Three other portents of disaster were described by Paolo Giovio in 1549 and repeated in John Polemon&#x27;s 1578 account of the battle. When James was in council at the camp at Flodden Edge, a hare ran out of his tent and escaped the weapons of his knights; it was found that mice had gnawed away the strings and buckle of the king&#x27;s helmet; and in the morning his tent was spreckled with a bloody dew.

===Scotland after Flodden===
The wife of James IV, Queen Margaret Tudor, is said to have awaited news of her husband at Linlithgow Palace, where a room at the top of a tower is called &#x27;Queen Margaret&#x27;s bower&#x27;. Ten days after the Battle of Flodden, the Lords of Council met at Stirling on 19 September, and set up a General Council of the Realm &quot;to sit upon the daily council for all matters occurring in the realm&quot; of thirty-five lords including clergymen, lords of parliament, and two of the minor barons, the lairds of The Bass and Inverrugy. This committee was intended to rule in the name of Margaret Tudor and her son James V of Scotland.

The full Parliament of Scotland met at Stirling Castle on 21 October, where the 17-month-old King was crowned in the Chapel Royal. The General Council of Lords made special provisions for the heirs of those killed at Flodden, following a declaration made by James IV at Twiselhaugh, and protection for their widows and daughters. Margaret Tudor remained guardian or &#x27;tutrix&#x27; of the King, but was not made Regent of Scotland.

The French soldier Antoine d&#x27;Arces arrived at Dumbarton Castle in November with a shipload of armaments which were transported to Stirling. The English already knew the details of this planned shipment from a paper found in a bag at Flodden field. Now that James IV was dead, Antoine d&#x27;Arces promoted the appointment of John Stewart, Duke of Albany, a grandson of James II of Scotland as Regent to rule Scotland instead of Margaret and her son. Albany, who lived in France, came to Scotland on 26 May 1515. By that date Margaret had given birth to James&#x27;s posthumous son Alexander and married the Earl of Angus.

A later sixteenth-century Scottish attitude to the futility of the battle was given by Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie, in words that he attributed to Patrick Lord Lindsay at council before the engagement. Lord Lindsay advised the King to withdraw, comparing their situation to an honest merchant playing dice with a trickster, and wagering a gold rose-noble against a bent halfpenny. Their King was the gold piece, England the trickster, and Thomas Howard the halfpenny.

==Casualties==

Surrey&#x27;s army lost 1,500 men killed in battle. There were various conflicting accounts of the Scottish loss. A contemporary account produced in French for the Royal Postmaster of England, in the immediate aftermath of the battle, states that about 10,000 Scots were killed, a claim repeated by Henry VIII on 16 September while he was still uncertain of the death of James IV. William Knight sent the news from Lille to Rome on 20 September, claiming 12,000 Scots had died, with fewer than 500 English casualties. Italian newsletters put the Scottish losses at 18,000 or 20,000 and the English at 5,000. Brian Tuke, the English Clerk of the Signet, sent a newsletter stating 10,000 Scots killed and 10,000 escaped the field. Tuke reckoned the total Scottish invasion force to have been 60,000 and the English army at 40,000. George Buchanan wrote in his &quot;History of Scotland&quot; (published in 1582) that, according to the lists that were compiled throughout the counties of Scotland, there were about 5,000 killed. A plaque on the monument to the 2nd Duke of Norfolk (as the Earl of Surrey became in 1514) at Thetford put the figure at 17,000. Edward Hall, thirty years after, wrote in his &quot;Chronicle&quot; that &quot;12,000 at the least of the best gentlemen and flower of Scotland&quot; were slain.

As the nineteenth-century antiquarian John Riddell supposed, nearly every noble family in Scotland would have lost a member at Flodden. The dead are remembered by the song (and pipe tune) &quot;Flowers of the Forest&quot;:

::We&#x27;ll hae nae mair lilting, at the yowe-milking,
::Women and bairns are dowie and wae.
::Sighing and moaning, on ilka green loaning,
::The flowers of the forest are all wede away.

Contemporary English ballads also recalled the significance of the Scottish losses:

::To tell you plaine, twelve thousand were slaine,
::that to the fight did stand;
::And many prisoners tooke that day,
::the best in all Scotland.

::That day made many a fatherlesse childe,
::and many a widow poore;
::And many a Scottish gay Lady,
::sate weeping in her bowre.

A legend grew that while the artillery was being prepared in Edinburgh before the battle, a demon called Plotcock had read out the names of those who would be killed at the Mercat Cross on the Royal Mile. According to Pitscottie, a former Provost of Edinburgh, Richard Lawson, who lived nearby, threw a coin at the Cross to appeal against this summons and survived the battle.

Branxton Church was the site of some burials from the Battle of Flodden.

After Flodden, many Scottish nobles are believed to have been brought to Yetholm for interment, as being the nearest consecrated ground in Scotland.

===Names of Scottish casualties from property records===
A number of subsequent property transactions give names of the fallen. A register of royal charters was kept and published as the &quot;Register of the Great Seal of Scotland&quot;. The battle was mentioned because of the declaration James IV had made at Twiselhaugh respecting the heritage of the heirs of potential casualties, which waived feudal fees. Some of the lands noted were those held under Matthew, Earl of Lennox, who died in the battle of Flodden Field, &quot;in campo bellico de Flodoun&quot; (in the field of war at Flodden). Other great seal charters mentioned an altar dedicated for remembrance at St Giles&#x27;, Edinburgh and the effect of the battle on Selkirk, a border town. These names include Adam Hacket, husband of Helen Mason.

The &quot;Exchequer Rolls of Scotland&quot;, a record of royal income, also gives names of the fallen. These were feudal tenants who held their lands from the King and would pay their dues directly to the exchequer. The names of landless men or those who held their lands from a landlord would not appear in this record. The preface to the published volume of the &quot;Exchequer Rolls&quot; gives this explanation and guide to the variety of Latin phrases used to describe deaths in the campaign;

The usual form of entry is &quot;qui obiit in bello&quot; (who died in the war), &quot;in campo bellico&quot; (in field of war), or &quot;in campo&quot; (in the field); but the forms also occur &quot;qui obiit sub vixillo regis&quot;, (who died under the king&#x27;s banner), which probably denotes that the fallen man was killed at Flodden, or &quot;qui obiit in exercitu in Northumberland&quot; (who died in the army in Northumberland), which perhaps indicates that the death occurred elsewhere than at Flodden, or that the place of death was unknown. In the Responde Books the earlier Sasines (property documents) are silent as to the campaign. The later Sasines refer to it as &quot;bellum&quot;, or &quot;campus bellicus,&quot; and it is not till 1518 that Flodden is named, and then only about half-a-dozen times. ..., It must be borne in mind that it is only the King&#x27;s vassals or tenants who left heirs in lands in the comparatively small portion of Scotland then held by the King, whose names can be expected to appear in the present Accounts. Besides the names in the following list, there are many other instances of Sasines taken in favour of the heirs of persons whom we know from other sources to have died at Flodden. p.clxii

==English soldiers knighted at Flodden==
Around forty-five English soldiers were knighted by the Earl of Surrey after the battle. Edward Hall mentions some of their positions in the army&#x27;s advance from Newcastle.
==Battlefield today==
The battlefield still looks much as it probably did at the time of the battle, but the burn and marsh which so badly hampered the Scots advance is now drained. A monument, erected in 1910, is easily reached from Branxton village by following the road past St Paul&#x27;s Church. There is a small car park and a clearly marked and signposted battlefield trail with interpretive boards which make it easy to visualise the battle. Only the chancel arch remains of the medieval church where James IV&#x27;s body was said to have rested after the battlethe rest is Victorian, dating from 1849 in the &quot;Norman&quot; style.

Each year, the neighbouring Scottish town of Coldstream marks the Battle of Flodden with a traditional horse ride to the battlefield and then having a service to mark all those who perished during the fight during the town&#x27;s &quot;Civic Week&quot;held in the first week of August.

==Commemoration==
The stained-glass Flodden Window in St Leonard&#x27;s Church, Middleton, now in Greater Manchester, reputedly houses the oldest war memorial in Great Britain, constructed by Sir Richard Assheton in memory of the Battle of Flodden and the archers from Middleton who fought in it.

The Quincentennial of the battle in 2013 was commemorated by a programme of projects and events bringing together communities from both sides of the border. A number were funded by an £887,300 Heritage Lottery Fund grant including the expansion of the Flodden 1513 Ecomuseum and archaeology, documentary research and education projects, exhibitions and a solemn commemoration.

==In fiction==
* &quot;Marmion: A Tale of Flodden Field&quot; (1808), an epic poem in six cantos by Sir Walter Scott
* The Battle of Flodden Field, told from several different perspectives, is the subject of the novel, &quot;Flodden Field&quot;, by Elisabeth McNeill, published in 2007.
* Flodden from the perspective of a Yorkshire archer is the subject of the novel &quot;Tom Fleck&quot;, by Harry Nicholson, published in 2011.
* &quot;The Flowers of the Forest&quot;, a historical novel by Elizabeth Byrd, chronicles the life of Queen Margaret Tudor of Scotland and culminates in the Battle of Flodden.
* Arthur Sullivan wrote an overture, his &quot;Overture Marmion&quot; (1867), inspired by the Scott poem.
* &quot;Sunset at Noon&quot; by Jane Oliver (1955) is a fictional account of the life of James IV.
* There is no historical record of anyone from the Clan Munro taking part in the Battle of Flodden Field; however, there is an old tradition that the Munros of Argyll are descended from a Flodden survivor. One of these descendants was Neil Munro.
* Gary Mill&#x27;s 2017 novel &#x27;Flodden&#x27; is a dramatised account of the battle of Flodden 

==In film and television==

* The British documentary series &quot;Two Men in a Trench&quot; also featured the battle in its first season, giving an accurate picture of what occurred and explaining the battle dynamics, showing the weakness and strong points of weapons used, etc.
* The second season of the Starz television series &quot;The Spanish Princess&quot; featured the battle. The depiction was fictionalized in certain respects, for example by having the title character, Catherine of Aragon, on the battlefield at the head of the English troops while heavily pregnant. The filming location was the Mendip Hills in Somerset.
* Towards the beginning of the 1969 movie The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie the title character talks about The Battle of Flodden.

<text>Alfred Ernst Christian Alexander Hugenberg (19 June 1865 – 12 March 1951) was an influential German businessman and politician. An important figure in nationalist politics in Germany during the first three decades of the twentieth century, Hugenberg became the country&#x27;s leading media proprietor during the 1920s. As leader of the German National People&#x27;s Party, he played a part in helping Adolf Hitler become chancellor of Germany and served in his first cabinet in 1933, hoping to control Hitler and use him as his tool. The plan failed, and by the end of 1933 Hugenberg had been pushed to the sidelines. Although he continued to serve as a guest member of the Reichstag until 1945, he wielded no political influence. Following World War II, he was interned by the British in 1946 and classified as &quot;exonerated&quot; in 1951 after undergoing denazification.

Hugenberg&#x27;s fundamental political and philosophical principles can be traced back to his youth. His university studies and early work organizing agricultural societies led him to view the independent farmer or small businessman as the ideal German. He believed in social Darwinism, despised communism, socialism and trade unions, and was in general skeptical of big business and finance. He thought that Germany needed an authoritarian government – ideally a monarchy – and strongly supported nationalism and imperialism in the belief that Germany could be secure only as a great power. The fall of the Hohenzollern monarchy at the end of World War I came as a tremendous shock, and from that point until the establishment of the Nazi state in 1933 he focused on bringing down the parliamentary government of the Weimar Republic.

Hugenberg earned degrees in both economics and law. In 1891, at the age of twenty-six, he co-founded the nationalist organization that later became the Pan-German League. He worked in the Prussian civil service and in private business before joining the Krupp steel works where he was chairman of the board of directors from 1909 until 1918. His work there led to seats on other supervisory boards and trade associations. During World War I, Hugenberg was an annexationist who wanted the Empire to expand to the east through German settlements. He blamed Germany&#x27;s defeat on Jews and socialists who had supposedly stabbed the Germany army in the back.

After the war, Hugenberg left Krupp to concentrate on politics and building up the media empire that he had started in 1916 when he bought the Scherl publishing house. That purchase was followed by the news agency Telegraphen-Union, numerous newspapers and in 1927 a controlling interest in the Universum-Film-AG (Ufa), a major film producer. Hugenberg&#x27;s media outlets provided stiff and sometimes dominating competition to older liberal media companies such as Ullstein and Mosse (both of which were owned by Jews).

As a representative of the German National People&#x27;s Party (DNVP), Hugenberg was a member of the Weimar National Assembly from 1919–20 and then of the German Reichstag until 1945. For many years he provided the majority of the DNVP&#x27;s funds, and his influence dominated the right-wing press in Germany. As the most influential voice in the DNVP&#x27;s pan-German bloc, he opposed the Dawes Plan, which attempted to resolve the issues surrounding Germany&#x27;s reparations payments, in the belief that a return to the economic chaos of hyperinflation would bring down the Republic. Hugenberg became chairman of the DNVP after the party&#x27;s substantial losses in the 1928 Reichstag elections. He obtained &quot;dictatorial&quot; leadership powers and tried to transform the party into a &quot;Hugenberg movement&quot;. He also shifted emphasis to the extra-parliamentary sphere with the aim of forcing the replacement of parliamentary government by an authoritarian regime. His radicalism caused the DNVP to split, with many key industrialists leaving the party.

Hugenberg&#x27;s first tentative media support of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party came following the failed Beer Hall Putsch in 1923. The relationship deepened in 1929 when the DNVP and Nazis joined forces in an unsuccessful bid to stop the Young Plan, a second attempt to resolve the reparations issue. The two parties were also part of the short-lived Harzburg Front of 1931 that was formed to create a united front against the government of Chancellor Heinrich Brüning. Both efforts at cooperation benefited the Nazis more than the DNVP. The Nazis gained the most from the radicalization of the middle classes, and the moderate elements in the DNVP continued to move away from the party.

By early 1933 Hugenberg realized that his attempt to ally with the Nazis had failed and that they presented a danger to the state and society. He nevertheless became minister of Economics and of Food and Agriculture in the Hitler cabinet. He became increasingly isolated in the cabinet and failed in his attempt to become &quot;economic dictator&quot;. He was forced out of the cabinet after five months, on the same day that the DNVP voted to disband. After that he no longer had any political influence and over time also had to cede his media holdings to the Nazis.

After World War II he was interned by the British. He died in 1951.

==Early years==
=== Political philosophy ===
Born in Hanover to Carl Hugenberg, a royal Hanoverian official who in 1867 entered the Prussian Landtag as a member of the National Liberal Party, the young Hugenberg studied law in Göttingen, Heidelberg, and Berlin, as well as economics in Strassburg. As a child, he had a love of writing poetry, which was strongly discouraged by his father who instead raised Hugenberg to be a bureaucrat like himself. In 1891, Hugenberg was awarded a PhD at Strassburg for his dissertation &quot;Internal Colonization in Northwest Germany&quot;, in which he set out three ideas that guided his political thought for the rest of his life:
* The necessity for statist economic policies to allow German farmers to be successful.
* Despite the necessity for the state to assist farmers, the German farmer should be encouraged to act as an entrepreneur, thereby creating a class of successful farmers/small businessmen who would act as a bulwark against the appeal of the Marxist Social Democrats, whom Hugenberg viewed as a grave threat to the status quo.
* Finally, allowing German farmers to be successful required a policy of imperialism, as Hugenberg argued on social Darwinist grounds that the &quot;power and significance of the German race&quot; could be secured if Germany colonized other nations. Hugenberg maintained that Germany&#x27;s prosperity depended upon having a great empire, and argued that, in the coming 20th century, Germany would have to battle three great rivals, namely Britain, the United States and Russia, for world supremacy.

Later in 1891, Hugenberg co-founded, along with Karl Peters, the ultra-nationalist General German League, and in 1894 its successor movement, the Pan-German League (). From 1894 to 1899, Hugenberg worked as a Prussian civil servant in Posen (modern Poznań, Poland). In 1900, he married his second cousin, Gertrud Adickes (1868–1960), with whom he had four children. Gertrude was the daughter of Franz Burchard Adickes, Mayor of Frankfurt.

The son of an upper-middle-class family, Hugenberg initially resented the (landed nobility), but over time he came to accept the idea of &quot;feudal-industrial control of Germany&quot;, believing in an alliance of and industrialists. Alongside these beliefs, Hugenberg maintained an ardent belief in imperialism and opposition to democracy and socialism.

At the same time, Hugenberg became involved in a scheme in the Province of Posen in which the Prussian Settlement Commission bought land from Poles in order to settle ethnic Germans there. In 1899, Hugenberg called for &quot;annihilation of Polish population&quot;. Hugenberg was strongly anti-Polish, and criticized the Prussian government for its &quot;inadequate&quot; Polish policies, favoring a more vigorous policy of Germanization.

Hugenberg initially took a role organizing agricultural societies before entering the civil service in the Prussian Ministry of Finance in 1903. Hugenberg came into conflict with his superiors, who opposed his plans to confiscate all the non-productive estates of the in order to settle hundreds of thousands of ethnic Germans who would become his idealized farmer-small businessmen and &quot;Germanize&quot; the East.

=== Chairman at Krupp Steel ===

He subsequently left the public sector to pursue a career in business, and in 1909 he was appointed chairman of the supervisory board of Krupp Steel where he built up a close personal and political relationship with Baron Gustav Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach, the CEO of Krupp AG. Krupp had been &quot;in search of a man of really superior intelligence&quot; to run the finance department of Krupp AG and found that man in Hugenberg, with his &quot;extraordinary&quot; intelligence and work ethic. In 1902, Friedrich Alfred Krupp&#x27;s homosexuality was revealed to the public. He killed himself or died from illness shortly after the Social Democratic newspaper &quot;Vorwärts&quot; published love letters he had written to his Italian male lovers. After Krupp&#x27;s death, the entire firm of Krupp AG was left to his eldest daughter, Bertha Krupp. As Krupp AG was one of the world&#x27;s largest arms manufacturers and the chief supplier of weapons to the German state, the management of Krupp AG was of some interest to the state, and Emperor Wilhelm II did not believe that a woman was capable of running a business. To solve this perceived problem, the Emperor had Bertha marry a career diplomat, Gustav von Bohlen und Halbach, who was regarded by the Emperor as a safe man to run Krupp AG. Gustav Krupp, as he was renamed by Wilhelm, knew little about running a business and so depended on his board to assist him. Hugenberg&#x27;s role in the management of Krupp AG was thus considerably larger than would be indicated by his title of director of finance; in many ways, he was the man who effectively ran the Krupp corporation during his ten years at the firm between 1908 and 1918.

During his time at Krupp AG, Hugenberg was known for his &quot;inflexibility&quot;, &quot;stubbornness&quot;, and &quot;self-righteousness&quot; as he constantly fought with the two unions representing the workers, one allied with the Social Democrats (SPD) and the other with the Centre Party. Hugenberg did not approve of either union and instead sponsored a &quot;yellow&quot; union representing the management, making his tenure a time of endless disputes with the workers. Hugenberg favored the idea of a (), where the Krupp family would act as the patriarchal authority to their workers, granting them higher wages and even junior shares in Krupp AG, in exchange for which the workers would be subservient and loyal to (&quot;the firm&quot;) as Krupp AG was always called. Very little came of his plans for a , and living conditions and wages for the workers at did not change very much during Hugenberg&#x27;s time. Hugenberg&#x27;s interest in having the workers own their own houses stemmed only from his interest in stopping demands for democracy and socialism. His strong social Darwinist views led him to argue that the problem of poverty was a genetic problem, with the poor inheriting bad genes that made them unsuccessful in life. Improving their living standards for him was only necessary to halt demands for political and social change as opposed to a positive goal in and of itself.

At the time, Krupp AG was Europe&#x27;s largest corporation and one of the largest corporations in the world, and Hugenberg&#x27;s success in raising annual dividends from 8% in 1908 to 14% in 1913 won him much admiration in the world of German business. A more unwelcome appearance in the limelight occurred with the Kornwalzer affair, in which the Social Democrat Reichstag member Karl Liebknecht exposed industrial espionage by Hugenberg. The management of Krupp AG did not even try to deny the allegations of bribery and industrial espionage, with Krupp arguing in a press article that any attack on the firm of Krupp AG was an attack on the ability of the German state to wage war by the socialist-pacifist SPD, and although several junior employees of Krupp AG were convicted of corruption, Hugenberg and the rest of the Krupp board were never indicted. In 1912, Emperor Wilhelm II personally awarded Hugenberg the Order of the Red Eagle for his success at Krupp AG, saying that Germany needed more businessmen like Hugenberg. At the ceremony, Hugenberg praised the Emperor in his acceptance speech and went on to say that democracy would not improve the condition of the German working class, but only a &quot;very much richer, very much greater and very much more powerful Germany&quot; would solve its problems. After the Social Democrats won the largest number of seats in the in the 1912 elections, Hugenberg first became interested in the media. He believed that center-right and right-wing parties such as the National Liberals and the Conservatives needed more newspapers to champion their views.

==First World War==
=== Annexationist beliefs ===
As well as administering Krupp&#x27;s finances with considerable success, Hugenberg also set about developing personal business interests from 1916 onwards, including a controlling interest in the national newsmagazine (The Garden Arbor). In 1914, Hugenberg welcomed the onset of the First World War and resumed his work with his close friend Heinrich Class of the Pan-German League. During the war, Hugenberg was an annexationist who wanted the war to end with Germany annexing portions of Europe, Africa and Asia to make the German Reich into the world&#x27;s greatest power. In September 1914, Hugenberg and Class co-wrote a memorandum setting out the annexationist platform, which demanded that, once the war was won, Germany would annex Belgium and northern France, British sea power would end, and Russia would be reduced to the &quot;frontiers existing at the time of Peter the Great&quot;. Beyond that, Germany was to annex all of the British, French and Belgian colonies in sub-Saharan Africa and create an &quot;economic union&quot; embracing Germany, France, Austria-Hungary, Italy, the Scandinavian nations and the nations of the Balkans, which would be dominated by the Reich. Finally, the Hugenberg–Class memo called for a policy of colonization in Eastern Europe, where the German state would settle thousands of German farmers in the land annexed from the Russian Empire. On 7 November 1914, Hugenberg and Class presented their memo before the Central Association of German Industrialists, the Union of Industrialists and the League of German Farmers to ask for their support, which was granted, albeit with the request that Hugenberg and Class rewrite their memo to remove some of the blunter social Darwinist language.

The chancellor, Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg, was initially an annexationist himself but refused to support the annexationists in public. Under the Constitution of 1871, the Reichstag had limited powers, one of which was the right to pass budgets. In the 1912 elections, the Social Democrats won more seats in the Reichstag than any other party. In 1914, they split into two factions, with the Independent Social Democrats opposing the war and the Majority Social Democrats supporting the war on the grounds that Russia was supposedly about to attack Germany. However, the Majority Social Democrats were opposed to the annexationists, and to secure their cooperation in passing budgets, Bethmann Hollweg refused to support the annexationists in public. Bethmann Hollweg&#x27;s – drafted in September 1914 at a time when the fall of Paris was believed to be imminent, as the German armies had almost reached the French capital, and to be issued when Paris fell – was remarkably similar to the Hugenberg–Class memo.

Aside from his membership in the Pan-German League, Hugenberg had a more personal reason for being an annexationist. Together with his industrialist friends Emil Kirdorf, Hugo Stinnes and Wilhelm Beukenberg, Hugenberg in 1916–1917 founded a number of corporations to exploit the occupied parts of Belgium and northern France. These companies were favored by the Army, which ruled occupied Belgium and France. Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg and General Erich Ludendorff – both firm annexationists – appreciated Hugenberg&#x27;s willingness to spend millions of marks to mobilize public support for their cause. In 1918, after the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Hugenberg founded two corporations, the Landgesellschaft Kurland m.b.H and Neuland AG, which had a combined budget of 37 million marks, to establish cooperative funds that would make loans to the hundreds of thousands of German farmers that he expected to soon be settled in Eastern Europe. After Germany&#x27;s defeat in 1918 put an end to the plans to settle German farmers in the &quot;Lebensraum&quot; (biotope) of Eastern Europe, Hugenberg used the money that had been allocated to the colonization schemes in Eastern Europe to buy up newspapers.

=== Beginnings of media empire ===
Believing that Bethmann Hollweg was not one of them, Hugenberg, like the rest of the annexationists, spent the years 1914 to 1917 attacking him as essentially a traitor. In 1915, Hugenberg published a telegram to Class in the name of the united chambers of commerce of the Ruhr, demanding that Wilhelm II dismiss Bethmann Hollweg and if the emperor was unwilling, that the military should depose Bethmann Hollweg, stating that if the Reich failed to achieve the annexationist platform once the war was won, it would cause a revolution from the right that would end the monarchy. It was Hugenberg&#x27;s interest in mobilizing support for the annexationists and bringing down Bethmann Hollweg that led him into the media, as Hugenberg in 1916 started to buy newspapers and publishing houses in order to create more organs for the expression of his imperialistic views. Hugenberg was secretly assisted by the state in his efforts to build a media empire, all the more so as the state distrusted the liberal newspapers owned by the Ullstein brothers and by Rudolf Mosse, all of whom were Jewish, leading the state to request that a circle of &quot;patriotic&quot; businessmen lend Hugenberg the necessary funds to buy up newspapers. The most important of Hugenberg&#x27;s allies in lending him the money were various members of the Krupp family.

After buying the Scherl newspaper chain in July 1916, Hugenberg announced, at the first meeting of the board under his management, that he had only bought the Scherl corporation to champion annexationist and Pan-German war aims, and that any editors opposed to his expansionist views should resign immediately, before he fired them. In buying the Scherl corporation, Hugenberg acquired the Berlin newspaper (The Day), which became the flagship paper of his media empire. had a daily circulation of 18,000–20,000 when Hugenberg brought Scherl in 1916 and was a &quot;quality&quot; paper mostly read by educated middle-class people. Another Scherl newspaper was the , a paper aimed at lower-middle class readership that had a daily circulation of a quarter of million; was the more prestigious newspaper, but the was the more profitable one. Hugenberg&#x27;s biographer, John Leopold, wrote: &quot;This very visible success of the Scherl concern led to the charge that Hugenberg was a war profiteer and an unscrupulous manipulator of the postwar inflation. This was undoubtedly true. During the period from 1914 through 1924, Hugenberg had securely established the basis of his entire syndicate. His business transactions were filled with plans to buy and sell shares of different companies, the creation of new corporations as holding concerns to take various firms, contracts with confidants acting as middlemen and ever-present schemes to avoid taxes. Hugenberg exploited the corporate law, which he knew so well, and used his own financial acumen, which had been so finely developed, to secure his empire. He knew the rules of the game and manipulated them to full advantage.&quot;

=== Post-war disillusionment ===
Hugenberg remained at Krupp until 1918, when he set out to build his own business, and during the Great Depression he was able to buy up dozens of local newspapers. Hugenberg&#x27;s increasing involvement in Pan-German and annexationist causes together with his interest in building a media empire caused him to depart from Krupp, which he found to be a distraction from what really interested him. These newspapers became the basis of his publishing firm, Scherl House, and, after he added controlling interests in Universum Film AG (UFA), Ala-Anzeiger AG, Vera Verlag and the Telegraphen Union, he had a near-monopoly on the German media, which he used to agitate for opposition to the Weimar Republic amongst Germany&#x27;s middle classes. Despite his media empire, Hugenberg detested intellectuals and avoided their company as much as possible. A workaholic, Hugenberg rarely went to the cinema or the theater, and he spent most of his free time at either his mansion in Dahlem (the most expensive district in Berlin) or his estate at Rohbraken. His only vacations were to visit the spa at Bad Kissingen once every year to treat his obesity and to visit his friend Leo Wegener in Kreuth in Bavaria about twice every year. In the words of his biographer, Hugenberg lived &quot;...the life of a stolid burgher surrounded by business associates, family and friends who reinforced his basic ideas&quot;.

For Hugenberg, the great trauma of his life was Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War One, which he blamed on the November Revolution, the &quot;stab-in-the-back&quot; that was alleged to have defeated the just when it was alleged to be on the verge of victory. Hugenberg was always convinced that Germany would recover from the defeat of 1918, all the more so as he believed the German military had not actually been defeated in 1918. In his viewpoint, because it was the &quot;stab-in-the-back&quot; that caused the defeat, all that was necessary was merely to remove the &quot;traitors&quot; from the scene in order to win the next world war that he expected to occur sometime in the near future. In Hugenberg&#x27;s viewpoint, just as the Thirty Years&#x27; War was followed by the rise of Brandenburg/Prussia, and the crushing defeat of Prussia by Napoleon in 1806 was followed by the War of Liberation in 1813–1814, so too would the Prussian-German state rise again to emerge victorious over its enemies. Hugenberg&#x27;s devotion to the &quot;social Darwinist and Nietzschean philosophies&quot;, with their emphasis on the power of willpower that he had embraced in the late 19th century, further reinforced his commitment to doing his part in bringing about the revival of Germany.

==Nationalist leader==
=== German National People&#x27;s Party ===

Hugenberg was one of a number of Pan-Germans to become involved in the National Liberal Party in the runup to the First World War. During the war, his views shifted sharply to the right. Accordingly, he switched his allegiance to the Fatherland Party and became one of its leading members, emphasizing territorial expansion and anti-Semitism as his two main political issues. In 1919 Hugenberg followed most of the Fatherland Party into the German National People&#x27;s Party (, DNVP), which he represented in the Weimar National Assembly, which wrote the 1919 Constitution of the Weimar Republic. He was elected to the in the 1920 elections to the new body. Hugenberg defined his interests as finding a &quot;cure for the sick and crazy climate&quot; of the Weimar Republic, which for him was &quot;power and the use of power&quot;. Influenced by Otto von Bismarck and Wilhelm II, Hugenberg believed in &quot;Sammlungspolitik&quot; (&quot;the politics of rallying together&quot;) to create a broad national opposition to the Weimar Republic and to hold together the DNVP, which had strong fissiparous tendencies.

Unable to find positive goals that were capable of holding the DNVP together, let alone of creating the sort of national unity that he wanted, Hugenberg came to define his in negative terms by seeking to find &quot;enemies&quot; to provide a unity in hatred. In his first speech before the , Hugenberg called the Finance Minister, Matthias Erzberger, a &quot;traitor&quot; for having signed the Armistice of 1918, and claimed his policies as Finance minister were meant to bind the to &quot;international economic slavery&quot;. To create the desired rallying together, Hugenberg supported what was known at the time as (catastrophe politics), believing that the worse things were, the sooner the Weimar Republic would end. After speaking in 1919, Hugenberg would not give a speech again in the until 1929, and he rarely spoke at meetings of the Reich Association of German Industry; however, his ability to donate millions of marks to his favored causes made him an important figure within the DNVP. Hugenberg was a poor speaker and devoid of charm. Those who knew well stated he was &quot;not a man, but a wall&quot; owing to his extreme obstinacy, as he loathed any sort of compromise, and it was often stated he was &quot;not an easy man&quot; to deal with.

=== Growth of media empire ===
In 1920, Hugenberg founded a populist tabloid, the , which became his most profitable newspaper, having a daily circulation of 216,000 by 1929. The most important of Hugenberg&#x27;s media properties were the , which he founded in 1921 by buying and merging the , the and the . The (TU) played a role in the German media analogous to Reuters&#x27;s in the United Kingdom and the Associated Press in the United States, employing some 250 journalists in thirty offices around the world to report on national and international news for smaller newspapers in Germany that could not afford national and international correspondents. At the height of its influence, some 1,600 newspapers in Germany subscribed to the , making it an effective competitor to the Telegraph Bureau, owned by the liberal and Jewish journalist Theodor Wolff. Hugenberg had founded the TU to compete with the Telegraph Bureau following complaints from German conservatives of &quot;liberal bias&quot; at the Wolff-owned Telegraph Bureau. Though the was described as &quot;non-partisan&quot;, its coverage of both national and foreign news tended to be very sympathetic towards right-wing political parties opposed to the Weimar Republic. The Hugenberg papers constantly hammered home the message that the Weimar Republic was born of the &quot;stab-in-the-back&quot;, and its leaders were the &quot;November criminals&quot;. Those who endorsed such views were always described as &quot;the experts&quot; while those opposed were &quot;partisan politicians&quot;, creating the impression that the belief in the &quot;stab-in-the-back&quot; was the objective truth, while those opposed were people subjectively pursuing their own agenda. To reinforce the point, the Hugenberg papers blamed every conceivable problem in Germany on the defeat of 1918 while painting a counter-factual picture of the Empire being a utopia had the war ended in victory in 1918.

In cities such as Berlin, the Hugenberg newspapers had to compete with the liberal newspapers owned by the Ullstein and Mosse families, and the Hugenberg media empire was most influential in the small towns and rural areas of Germany where the newspapers owned by Hugenberg were most people&#x27;s main source of the news. Even in areas where Hugenberg did not own the newspapers, the local newspapers were dependent upon the Hugenberg-owned for news outside of their areas; about 600 newspapers in the rural areas and small towns of Germany exclusively reprinted articles written by TU journalists for their national and international news. During the Weimar Republic, Germany had about 3,000 newspapers, of which only 14 were owned by Hugenberg. It was via the TU that some 1,600 newspapers, mostly in rural areas and small towns, used for national and international news that Hugenberg had influence.

Although Hugenberg was often described as representing the interests of the industrialists, John Leopold wrote: &quot;His nationalist insistence on autarchy and his diametrical opposition to all forms of unionism represented not the attitude of most businessmen, but the ideology of the Pan-German League. No longer concerned with the profits and losses of any industry other than his media empire, Hugenberg was free to criticize the immediate demands of industrialists for practical solutions and he reverted to the simplistic solutions espoused by the Pan-Germans since the prewar era&quot;. Hugenberg&#x27;s social Darwinist views remained unchanged as he argued that the &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; should become &quot;the life principle of development&quot;, a stance that put him at odds with the leaders of the left wing of the DNVP such as Hans Schlange-Schöningen, Gottfried Treviranus, Walther Lambach, and Gustav Hülser, men who shared his vehement opposition to Marxism, but were opposed to his harsh social Darwinism. Amongst the DNVP Reichstag members whom Hugenberg associated with were General Wilhelm von Dommes, the emissary for the emperor in exile; Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz; Gottfried Gok, a Pan-German leader; and Theodor Duesterberg of &quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot;. Hugenberg founded a thinktank, the (the Economic Association for the Promotion of Intellectual Forces of Reconstruction) to promote his ideas, while he lived a pseudo-aristocratic lifestyle at his estate at Rohbraken. In 1922, together with the industrialist Emil Kirdorf, Hugenberg created an investment fund known as that served to subsidize groups &quot;very effective politically, but not commercially profitable&quot;. Hugenberg was the chairman of the fund, which started out with 600,000 marks and averaged a quarter of million marks in subsidies to any group that Hugenberg and Kirdorf approved of.

=== Opposition to reparations ===
In January 1923, when Germany defaulted on its reparations to France, the French premier Raymond Poincaré ordered the occupation of the Ruhr, marking the beginning of &quot;passive resistance&quot; that led to hyperinflation. As a supporter of , Hugenberg rather perversely welcomed the inflation as the beginning of the end of the Weimar Republic, arguing that the economic disaster would awaken the that would lead to the &quot;Third Reich&quot;. In an essay he wrote at the time, he stated that what Germany needed was a leader who had the charisma to &quot;attract the masses behind him like the Pied Piper of Hamelin...Only a few will and can do this. We, the entire spectrum of non-socialists, can do no more than prepare the way for these few. Hopefully we will find that which we desire.&quot; In this spirit, Hugenberg declared one could &quot;not be radical enough&quot;. It was during the crisis year of 1923 that Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz suggested that Hugenberg should pursue the chancellorship because there was no other &quot;personality in Germany who would be so suited to bring the &#x27;expeditious&#x27; understanding necessary for the salvation of our country and so suitable for the situation&quot;. The decision by Gustav Stresemann of the German People&#x27;s Party, until then considered a part of the &quot;national opposition&quot;, to accept the chancellorship and to end the passive resistance in September 1923 was condemned by Hugenberg as a betrayal. Stresemann became a (&quot;republican by reason&quot; – someone who was still loyal to the monarchy in his heart, but accepted the republic as the least bad alternative), and insofar as his policies aimed at economic and political stability, he became the subject of immense hatred from Hugenberg.

In November 1923, when the Nazis launched the Beer Hall Putsch in Munich, they received significant coverage in the Hugenberg newspapers for the first time. Adolf Hitler and the other Nazi leaders were portrayed as well-meaning but misguided patriots who were trying to end the Weimar Republic in the wrong way. In an editorial in the Hugenberg-owned newspaper, Hitler was praised as an &quot;exceptionally popular speaker&quot; who had &quot;liberated&quot; the minds of &quot;innumerable workers from international socialism&quot;, but the putsch was condemned on the grounds that &quot;You must gather together and not scatter! You must bind together and not tear apart!&quot;

To end the hyperinflation of 1923, a new currency, the &quot;Reichsmark&quot; was created to replace the worthless &quot;Papiermark&quot;, reparation payments were lowered through the Dawes Plan, and a huge loan to Germany was floated in New York. The American bankers insisted that the state-owned &quot;Deutsche Reichsbahn&quot; railroad be put up as a collateral for the loan, which in turn required amending the constitution with a two-thirds majority vote in the . As the DNVP did well in the elections of May 1924, to amend the constitution would require the votes of the DNVP Reichstag members, which split the party into two. The industrialists who supported the DNVP were in favor of the Dawes plan and threatened to cut off funding for the party forever if it voted against the Dawes Plan, while another faction still attached to favored rejecting the Dawes Plan on the grounds that a return to the economic chaos of 1923 was the best way of ending the Weimar Republic. Hugenberg emerged as one of the leaders of the latter faction that wanted to reject the Dawes Plan, writing bitterly at the time that &quot;two-thirds of the German people including those behind the German National People&#x27;s Party are internally prepared to let the freedom, honor and future of their land be sold in exchange for a few pieces of silver&quot;. When the vote occurred on 27 August 1924, 49 DNVP Reichstag members voted for the Dawes Plan while 48 voted against; Hugenberg missed the vote with a doctor&#x27;s note saying he was too unwell to attend the that day.

Since the DNVP agreed to support the government of Hans Luther, Hugenberg grew more embittered, writing a series of essays in February–March 1925, later published as a book, that included such lines as &quot;it stinks in the German &quot; and the &quot;false leaders belong in the asylums&quot;. In the 1925 presidential election, the Hugenberg newspapers supported Paul von Hindenburg for president, despite Hugenberg&#x27;s private reservations, as he believed Hindenburg as president would give the Republic more legitimacy. Hugenberg&#x27;s principle fear was that the DNVP under the leadership of Kuno von Westarp was moving in a &quot;Tory&quot; direction, by which he meant that it was starting to become a &quot;big tent&quot; conservative party like the British Conservative Party that combined different interest groups and as a result was toning down its ideology in a favor of pragmatic approach to power.

=== Putsch discussions with Heinrich Class ===

In January 1926, Hugenberg was involved in a plan for a putsch organized by his good friend, Henrich Class, calling for President Hindenburg to appoint as chancellor someone who was unacceptable for the , which would lead to a motion of no confidence. Hindenburg would respond by dissolving the and resigning while the election campaign was in progress; the Chancellor would become acting president, and Class planned to have him issue a declaration of martial law and become the &quot;Reich Regent&quot;. Class planned to have Hugenberg serve as minister of finance in the new government. The Social Democrats controlled Prussia, and the Prussian police arrested those involved in Class&#x27;s scheme. None of the accused was brought to trial except Class, and the judge dismissed the charges because of a lack of evidence, stating that merely talking about a putsch was not the same thing as planning a putsch. The charges brought Hugenberg much attention, and the spokesman for the Hugenberg press, Ludwig Bernhard, used the case to praise Hugenberg as a great German patriot who had used his fortune to buy up newspapers to protect the German press from the &quot;alien&quot; Ullstein and Mosse families. Bernhard noted that the Mosse and Ullstein families were Jewish while Hugenberg was not.

Bernhard&#x27;s pamphlet first made Hugenberg well known. It was during this period that Hugenberg&#x27;s friends such as Class and Leo Wegener started to promote Hugenberg and his business empire as a sort of brand despite his manifest lack of charm, proudly adopting the label &quot;Hugenberg press&quot; to describe his media empire, and gave him the image of a corporate superhero leader who could save Germany. The fact that Hugenberg rarely spoke in public during this period aided their efforts, giving him an aura of mystery. As the DNVP took part in several coalitions, Hugenberg emerged as one of the leading critics within the party of the approach of the party&#x27;s leader, Kuno von Westarp, charging that he was betraying the party&#x27;s principles. In 1927, the Scherl press published Hugenberg&#x27;s essays of 1925 as (Highlights from Past and Present), in which he attacked the policies associated with Westarp and implicitly challenged his competence to be the DNVP&#x27;s leader. In March 1927, Hugenberg purchased UFA, Europe&#x27;s largest film studio, which brought him further attention. Hugenberg presented the purchase of UFA as a political move instead of a business move. The Hugenberg newspapers loudly announced that UFA had been brought to prevent &quot;republicans, Jews and internationalists&quot; from making any more films at UFA.

==Leader of the DNVP==
=== Ousting of Westarp as party chairman ===

The DNVP suffered heavy losses in the 1928 election, leading to the appointment of Hugenberg as sole chairman on 21 October that same year. Hugenberg moved the party in a far more radical direction than it had taken under its previous leader, Kuno Graf von Westarp. After the 1928 election, a DNVP Reichstag member, Walther Lambach, published an article in the journal , saying that the poor showing of the DNVP in the election was due to its monarchism. Lambach argued that the vast majority of the German people did not pine for the return of the exiled Emperor, and the party&#x27;s emphasis on this point was alienating the public, which had come to accept the Republic. Lambach ended his article by writing that the DNVP needed a (popular conservatism) that addressed the concerns of ordinary Germans and that restoring the monarchy was not one of them.

Hugenberg was the leader of the DNVP monarchist purists for whom no changes in the party&#x27;s platform were acceptable, and he started to press for the DNVP to expel Lambach as a way of bringing down Westarp, who only agreed to censure Lambach for his article. At Hugenberg&#x27;s instigation, the Potsdam branch of the DNVP expelled Lambach on its own in July 1928, presenting Westarp with a fait accompli, which showed the way the party&#x27;s grassroots members felt about the Lambach affair. Hugenberg followed up this triumph with an article saying that the DNVP was &quot;not a parliamentary party in the proper sense of the word, but a grand group of men – a community of opinion, not a community of interests&quot;, which in his view had caused the DNVP to degenerate from its core principles, of which Lambach&#x27;s article was only the most deplorable and recent example. Hugenberg argued that the DNVP could not change its values, writing: &quot;Only an ideological party which is led and which leads can save the soul and economy of the German people!&quot; Using Lambach as a surrogate for his attack on Westarp, Hugenberg argued that the DNVP could not be a (&quot;mishmash&quot;) of people of different values such as monarchists and republicans, and could only be led by a &quot;strong&quot; leader fanatically devoted to upholding the party&#x27;s values, who would lead in an authoritarian style, by which he clearly meant himself. Lambach appealed against his expulsion and was allowed back into the DNVP, arguing that he himself was still a monarchist and his article was intended only to spark discussion.

However, the Lambach case had galvanized the DNVP&#x27;s membership against Westarp and for Hugenberg, who knew that the DNVP would be calling a party congress later that year that would have the power to elect a new leader, and that the Lambach affair was a godsend. Using the Lambach case as his rallying cry, Hugenberg campaigned aggressively amongst the party&#x27;s membership, greatly helped by the fact that the Pan-German League had taken over many of the DNVP&#x27;s local branches. When the party congress opened on 20 October 1928, Westarp was on the defensive right from the start as he was forced to apologize for the DNVP&#x27;s poor showing in the most recent election, and he appealed to the delegates themselves for ideas about improving the party&#x27;s image, making him look like a weak leader. By contrast, Hugenberg – who while lacking in charm and charisma – was able to present himself as a man with a definite plan to restore the party&#x27;s fortunes. The fact that the members of the Pan-German League were overrepresented at the party congress further favored Hugenberg, who was elected the DNVP&#x27;s new leader on 21 October 1928. As part of his campaign against Westarp, Hugenberg stressed his success as a businessman, but at the same time he also stressed that he was so wealthy that he was independent of big business and could follow his own line. Hugenberg gave the impression that the DNVP would not need any more donations from big business as he was so wealthy that he would fund the DNVP entirely out of his own pocket.

=== Nationalism and the &quot;Führerprinzip&quot; ===
He hoped to use radical nationalism to restore the party&#x27;s fortunes and eventually to overthrow the Weimar constitution and install an authoritarian form of government. Up to this point, right-wing politics outside of the far right was going through a process of reconciliation with the Weimar Republic, but this ended under Hugenberg, who renewed earlier DNVP calls for its immediate destruction. Under his direction, a new DNVP manifesto appeared in 1931, demonstrating the shift to the right. Amongst its demands were immediate restoration of the Hohenzollern monarchy, a reversal of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, compulsory military conscription, repossession of the German colonial empire, a concerted effort to build up closer links with German speaking people outside Germany (especially in Austria), a dilution of the role of the Reichstag to that of a supervisory body, a newly established professional house of appointees reminiscent of Benito Mussolini&#x27;s corporative state, and reduction in the perceived over-representation of Jews in German public life.

Hugenberg also sought to eliminate internal party democracy and instill a within the DNVP, leading to some members breaking away to establish the Conservative People&#x27;s Party (KVP) in late 1929. More were to follow in June 1930, appalled by Hugenberg&#x27;s extreme opposition to the cabinet of Heinrich Brüning, a moderate whom some within the DNVP wanted to support. Despite Hugenberg&#x27;s background in industry, that constituency gradually deserted the DNVP under his leadership, largely due to a general feeling amongst industrialists that Hugenberg was too inflexible, and soon the party became the main voice of agrarian interests in the Reichstag. Hugenberg&#x27;s unwillingness to have the DNVP enter the Brüning cabinet greatly embittered the industrialists, who complained that the DNVP under his leadership was a perpetual opposition party, and as a result the largest contributor to the DNVP by 1931 had become Hugenberg himself, which had the effect of cementing his control.

Hugenberg had purchased the UFA studio – the largest film production company in both Germany and Europe – with the aim of making right-wing &quot;national&quot; films, but in this case, his concern for profits overrode his ideology. The transition from silent film to talkies had imposed significant costs on UFA, which chose to mostly produce films designed for the widest possible audience in order to recoup the costs of installing sound equipment. Between 1930 and 1933, only a limited number of UFA films were the type of &quot;national&quot; films that Hugenberg had envisioned when he brought UFA, and of the &quot;national&quot; films only (1930), (1931), (1931) and (1933) were successful at the box office. Despite his anti-Semitism, Hugenberg did not fire the many Jews who worked at UFA as directors, script-writers, actors, etc. as he did not want to lose any talent to rival studios.

==The politics of polarization==
=== Opposition to the Young Plan and work with the Nazis ===
Hugenberg had a grand strategy to bring down &quot;the System&quot; as enemies of the Weimar Republic always called it. Hugenberg believed in the politics of polarization under which German politics were to be divided into two blocs, the right-wing &quot;national&quot; bloc whose leader he envisioned as himself and the Marxist left consisting of the Social Democrats and the Communists. As part of his strategy of polarization, Hugenberg intended to seize upon wedge issues and present them in a highly inflammatory manner in order to create a situation where one could be either for or against the &quot;national&quot; bloc, which was intended to lead to the electoral decline of all centrist parties in Germany. Leopold noted that Hugenberg &quot;debated political issues in terms of a simplistic, philosophic disjunction – a man was either for the nation or he was against it&quot;. Hugenberg wrote in 1929 in a memo outlining his planned politics of polarization that &quot;fate is only for the weak and the sick. The strong, healthy man molds his fate and that of his nation with his own will.&quot; Hugenberg believed that the same skills that made a successful media magnate would bring down the Weimar Republic as he deliberately pursued his strategy of (rallying together) as he called his polarizing strategy. As a part of this polarization, he planned to turn the DNVP from a party working within the to advance its goals – which was what the DNVP had more or less become under Westarp – into a movement that would work for the destruction of &quot;the System&quot;. Hugenberg had initially intended as his wedge issue the subject of constitutional reform, but he dropped it in the spring of 1929 as &quot;too abstract&quot; for most people in favor of opposing the Young Plan for reparations.

Taking advantage of a clause in the Weimar constitution that allowed a referendum to be called if enough people signed a petition demanding it, Hugenberg decided in June 1929 to collect signatures for a referendum on the Young Plan, which was intended to discredit the &quot;grand coalition&quot; government led by the Social Democratic chancellor Hermann Müller. Using highly emotional, visceral language, Hugenberg and his newspapers presented the Young Plan – which actually reduced reparations – in the starkest terms possible as a form of &quot;financial slavery&quot; for &quot;our children&#x27;s children&quot; which would reduce living standards in Germany down to an &quot;Asiatic&quot; level of poverty (at the time, the term &quot;Asiatic&quot; poverty referred to what today would be called a Third World living standard). By pushing for a referendum on the Young Plan, Hugenberg as intended forced the Müller &quot;grand coalition&quot; government to defend the Young Plan while Hugenberg as an opposition leader felt free to make extravagant promises about what he would do if he was chancellor, claiming that the would pay no reparations at all if he were in charge. Even at the time, it was widely recognized that Hugenberg&#x27;s status as an opposition leader free from the burdens of office allowed him the luxury of not suggesting a &quot;realistic alternative&quot; to the Young Plan. This was especially the case as the French government had agreed that in exchange for German acceptance of the Young Plan that France would end its occupation of the Rhineland in the summer of 1930, which was five years earlier than the Treaty of Versailles had called for. At the time, Hugenberg&#x27;s critics pointed out that if the Young Plan was rejected, then the French occupation of the Rhineland would continue until the summer of 1935, an aspect of Hugenberg&#x27;s rejectionist strategy that he never dwelled on. Hugenberg&#x27;s strategy was a negative one intended to create the &quot;national bloc&quot; that he envisioned meant there could be little discussion of what the &quot;national bloc&quot; intended to achieve, since there were too many divisions on the German right for a positive program, and instead the &quot;national bloc&quot; was to be united by what it was &quot;against&quot; instead of what it was &quot;for&quot;.

Hugenberg was vehemently opposed to the Young Plan, and he set up a &quot;Reich Committee for the German People&#x27;s Petition&quot; to oppose it, featuring the likes of Franz Seldte, Heinrich Class, Theodor Duesterberg and Fritz Thyssen. On 9 July 1929, Hugenberg founded the Reich Committee on the German Initiative to campaign against the Young Plan, which the Hugenberg newspapers hailed as the most important political development. Hugenberg saw the referendum as the beginning of the counterrevolution, writing at the time that thanks to him &quot;a front has arisen that knows only one goal: how the revolution [of 1918] can be overcome and a nation of free men can again be made from Germans&quot;. To achieve this goal, Hugenberg took 551,000 Reichsmarks from the Scherl corporation for discretionary spending and another 400,000 for &quot;special purposes&quot;, all of which he spent on the referendum. However, he recognized that the DNVP and their elite band of allies did not have enough popular support to carry a rejection of the scheme through. As such, Hugenberg felt that he needed a nationalist with support amongst the working classes whom he could use to whip up popular sentiment against the Plan. Adolf Hitler was the only realistic candidate, and Hugenberg decided that he would use the Nazi Party leader to get his way. As a result, the Nazi Party soon became the recipients of Hugenberg&#x27;s largesse, both in terms of monetary donations and of favorable coverage from the Hugenberg-owned press, which had previously largely ignored Hitler or denounced him as a socialist. Joseph Goebbels, who had a deep hatred of Hugenberg, initially spoke privately of breaking away from Hitler over the alliance, but he changed his mind when Hugenberg agreed that Goebbels should handle the propaganda for the campaign, giving the Nazi Party access to Hugenberg&#x27;s media empire.

 The infamous paragraph four in the proposed &quot;Law Against the Enslavement of the German People&quot; (more commonly known as the &quot;Freedom Law&quot;) – as the proposed anti-Young Plan bill to be submitted in the referendum was called – stipulating that those Reichstag members who voted for the Young Plan and those civil servants who handed over reparations were to be imprisoned, was inserted by Hitler and accepted by Hugenberg, who believed it would attract voters. Paragraph four of the &quot;Freedom Law&quot; instead divided the DNVP. Westarp and several other DNVP &quot;Reichstag&quot; members came out in opposition, arguing that paragraph four was going too far, while the Reich Association of German Industry declared its neutrality, despite Hugenberg&#x27;s efforts to have the association support him. Several industrialists such as Albert Vögler and Fritz Thyssen supported the &quot;Freedom Law&quot;, but the majority were opposed, favoring the Young Plan since it promised economic stability; rather than risk a split, the association declared itself neutral at a meeting on 20 September 1929. On 24 September 1929 at a gigantic rally in the Berlin Sports Palace, the four leaders of the Reich Committee against the Enslavement of the German People, namely Hugenberg, Hitler, Seldte and Class, formally began the campaign for the &quot;Law Against the Enslavement of the German People&quot;. On 30 November 1929, when the &quot;Freedom Law&quot; came up before the , 14 DNVP representatives abstained from voting while 3 voted against the &quot;Freedom Law&quot;, citing concerns about paragraph four. When Hugenberg tried to impose party discipline, 12 DNVP representatives left the party in protest over his leadership. The Hugenberg newspapers went all-out in support of the &quot;Freedom Law&quot;, running glaring headlines in support, but when the referendum was held, only 5,538,000 Germans voted yes for the &quot;Freedom Law&quot;, which was insufficient to for the law to pass.

=== Leadership failures ===
Hitler was able to use Hugenberg to push himself into the political mainstream, and once the Young Plan was passed by the &quot;Reichstag&quot;, Hitler promptly ended his links with Hugenberg. Leopold noted that Hugenberg&#x27;s polarizing strategy to divide Germany into two blocs had, starting with the Young Plan referendum, worked successfully, but the man who benefitted was not Hugenberg as intended, but rather Hitler. Hitler publicly blamed Hugenberg for the failure of the campaign, but he retained the links with big business that the committee had allowed him to cultivate, and this began a process of the business magnates deserting the DNVP for the Nazis. Hitler&#x27;s handling of the affair was marred by one thing, and that was the premature announcement in the Nazi press of his repudiation of the alliance with the Strasser brothers, whose left-wing economics were incompatible with Hugenberg&#x27;s arch-capitalism. On 6 January 1930, Hugenberg was summoned to meet President Paul von Hindenburg, who told him that now the Young Plan had been passed, he had no more need for Müller, and he was planning to bring in a new presidential government very soon that would be &quot;anti-parliamentary and anti-Marxist&quot;. Hindenburg explained the intention behind the presidential government, which would be based on the &quot;25/48/53 formula&quot; (a reference to the articles in the constitution that made such a government possible), was to gradually end democracy, and he wanted Hugenberg to be a cabinet minister in the new government. Much to Hindenburg&#x27;s vexation, Hugenberg refused to take part, maintaining that he would not be a cabinet minister in a government that paid reparations.

In an attempt to induce Hugenberg to support the new presidential government of Heinrich Brüning, a bill was introduced to increase taxes while also increasing government aid to farmers, one of the key groups that voted for the DNVP. The promise of more aid to farmers was popular in rural areas, and several DNVP representatives led by Westarp wanted the party to vote for the bill, which Hugenberg was opposed to on the grounds that some of the tax revenue raised would go to France in the form of reparations. On the first reading of the bill on 12 April 1930, the DNVP split with 31 representatives voting for while 23 led by Hugenberg voted against; on the second reading on 14 April 32 DNVP representatives voted for the bill while 20 voted against. That Hugenberg was incapable of controlling his own delegation led Hitler to openly mock him as a weak leader. When the bill was enacted under Article 48 (that is, by presidential decree), Hugenberg ordered the DNVP representatives to vote to cancel the bill on 18 July 1930; 25 DNVP representatives led by Westarp broke with party discipline to vote for the bill and left the party in protest. Bills passed under Article 48 could be cancelled by the , but Brüning threatened to have Hindenburg use Article 53 to dissolve the for a new election if his bill should be cancelled. As a consequence, Hindenburg dissolved the for an election only two years into its mandate. During the 1930 election campaign, Hugenberg&#x27;s shortcomings as a speaker were cruelly exposed. He came across as awkward, arrogant and above all very dull. During the campaign, the Hugenberg press largely concentrated its attacks on &quot;Marxism&quot;, warning that the SPD was working for a revolution and wanted to increase spending on the welfare state as the first step towards &quot;Bolshevism&quot;. The Nazis by contrast were treated relatively kindly by the Hugenberg papers with a editorial saying there were no differences between the DNVP and the NSDAP on &quot;culture and religion, the attitude towards Jewry and the will towards reconstruction in individual social and economic questions&quot;. The election ended with the DNVP being reduced to only 41 seats from 73 in the , while the Nazis went up from the 12 seats they won in 1928 to 107 seats.

On 26 November 1930, Brüning met with Hugenberg to ask him to join his government, only for Hugenberg – who was still following – to tell him that he would rather see the &quot;collapse which I predicted&quot;, and &quot;I must fight you and the entire system&quot;. Despite the way that Hitler now overshadowed him, Hugenberg was convinced that Hitler still owed a debt of some sort which he would have to repay by deferring to him. On 10 February 1931 Hugenberg joined the Nazi Party in walking with the DNVP out of the Reichstag altogether as a protest against the Brüning government. By then, the two parties were in a very loose federation, known as the National Opposition.

By 1930, Hugenberg was spending about 4,600 per month on the DNVP and another 7,500 RM on special expenses on the party. By 1931, when the Great Depression caused profits in the Hugenberg papers to drop by 30%, Hugenberg became insistent that the DNVP start to become financially self-sufficient instead of depending on him to subsidize the party. Though the Berlin newspapers such as and saw circulation decline, they continued to be in the black; by contrast, the provincial newspapers such as the in Stuttgart and in Munich were losing so much money that in 1931 Hugenberg seriously considered shutting both newspapers down. Despite the anti-Semitic and generally xenophobic line taken by his newspapers, Hugenberg had no hesitations about using the services of a German Jewish banker, Jacob Goldschmidt, to arrange a loan from a group of New York financers in May 1931 that allowed him to keep his provincial newspapers afloat.

Although President Paul von Hindenburg disliked Hugenberg, his neighbor in East Prussia and a fellow , Elard von Oldenburg-Januschau, was a DNVP member. Through Oldenburg-Januschau, Hugenberg was able to meet Hindenburg on his estate at Neudeck, where the former pressed the latter to appoint him chancellor, saying he was the only man who would &quot;master the situation&quot;. However, Hugenberg&#x27;s hubristic arrogance enraged Hindenburg, who complained that he was a , a field marshal and the president while Hugenberg treated him &quot;like a schoolboy&quot;.

The flagship paper of Hugenberg&#x27;s media empire, , in an editorial praised the Nazi &quot;will to sacrifice&quot; and &quot;courage to battle&quot;, but charged that the Nazis were too rash and too ignorant of economics to govern on their own, requiring the DNVP as a coalition partner, since the latter party was the party of &quot;schooled, conservative, constructive, youthfully strong determination&quot;. The appeal did not work as intended, and Ludwig Klitzsch, who ran the Scherl press, warned Hugenberg that the friendly coverage of the Nazis had &quot;...frequently exceeded the bounds of political wisdom&quot;. The fact that DNVP members did not have to pay dues, as NSDAP members did, proved to be a weakness, as the requirement to pay monthly dues inspired Nazi Party members with far more devotion to their cause than the DNVP members, who blithely assumed that Hugenberg&#x27;s fortune was more than enough to handle the party&#x27;s financial needs. In 1931, Hugenberg, whose fortune was not as vast as believed, was forced to cut DNVP&#x27;s budget by 31% in order to keep the party solvent. Hugenberg&#x27;s support for high tariffs for agriculture and his call to replace the welfare state with a program of &quot;self-help&quot; for the unemployed offended many in the cities.

==The Harzburg Front==
=== DNVP-Nazi cooperation ===

The collapse of the German banking system in the spring and summer of 1931 was seen by Hugenberg as an opportunity to create the nationalist (rallying together) that he had sought with the Young Plan referendum. On 9 July 1931, Hugenberg released a joint statement with Hitler guaranteeing that the pair would cooperate for the overthrow of the Weimar &quot;system&quot;. Hugenberg wanted to announce the creation of his front in Bad Harzburg in Braunschweig, a (state) governed by a DNVP-NSDAP coalition, to symbolize unity on the right. Hitler was wary of the plans, leading Hugenberg to complain in private of his &quot;megalomania, but also of uncontrollability, imprudence and lack of judgement&quot;. To show his strength before the joint rally in Bad Harzburg, Hugenberg held the DNVP&#x27;s party congress in September 1931 in Stettin, which was intentionally modelled after a Nazi rally. The presence at the congress of such figures such as Prince Oskar of Prussia, Admiral Ludwig von Schröder, Field Marshal August von Mackensen and Fritz Thyssen was intended to show that Hugenberg was a militaristic monarchist whose economic policies were supported by big business. At the party congress, Hugenberg blamed the Great Depression on the Treaty of Versailles, the gold standard and a misplaced belief in &quot;international capital&quot;. The first part of his solution to the Great Depression was a policy of autarky and protectionism. Ultimately, Hugenberg argued that the solution to the Great Depression was imperialism as he argued that Germans were a &quot;&quot; (&quot;people without space&quot;), which he felt was the fundamental problem with the German economy. As such, Hugenberg argued that Germany needed the return of its former colonial empire in Africa and to conquer (&quot;living space&quot;) in Eastern Europe, which would provide sufficient space for the Germans to colonize and people to exploit. For the Bad Harzburg rally, Hugenberg wanted a broad front that emphasized being respectable. Amongst the people he invited to Bad Harzburg who attended the rally were Crown Prince Wilhelm, Prince Oskar, Prince Eitel Friedrich, Heinrich Class, Count Eberhard von Kalkreuth, Admiral Magnus von Levetzow, Fritz Thyssen, Admiral Adolf von Trotha, General Hans von Seeckt, General Rüdiger von der Goltz, General Karl von Einem, and Hjalmar Schacht.

=== DNVP losses and rise of the Nazis ===
Hugenberg and Hitler presented a united front at Bad Harzburg on 21 October 1931 as part of a wider right-wing rally, leading to suggestions that a Harzburg Front involving the two parties and the veterans&#x27; organization had emerged. The two leaders soon clashed, and Hugenberg&#x27;s refusal to endorse Hitler in the 1932 German presidential election widened the gap. Indeed, the rift between the two opened further when Hugenberg, fearing that Hitler might win the presidency, persuaded Theodor Duesterberg to run as a Junker candidate after Prince Oskar of Prussia declined to run as the DNVP candidate. Although Duesterberg was eliminated on the first vote, due largely to Nazi allegations regarding his Jewish parentage, Hitler nonetheless failed to secure the presidency. As Duesterberg won only 6.8% vote of the vote compared to Hitler&#x27;s 30.1% and Hindenburg&#x27;s 49.6%, he dropped out from the second round of the presidential election. In desperation, Hugenberg tried to get Crown Prince Wilhelm to run as the DNVP&#x27;s candidate, only for the exiled emperor to issue a statement saying it was &quot;absolute idiocy&quot; for his son to run for president. More damaging, Crown Prince Wilhelm announced he would not run as the DNVP candidate, and instead endorsed Hitler for president.

Hugenberg&#x27;s speeches were intensely boring, and his attempt to create a Hitler-style personality cult around himself failed. Hugenberg&#x27;s mannerisms and his upper-class accent gave him the image of &quot;...an arrogant, unapproachable demigod&quot; who knew nothing of the concerns of ordinary people. Hugenberg&#x27;s cunning in business had earned him the nicknames the &quot;Cross Spider&quot; and the &quot;Silver Fox&quot;; however, as DNVP leader he was widely known as &quot;the Hamster&quot;. Hugenberg&#x27;s rotund build and short stature together with his handlebar mustache, brush-cut hairstyle and the Wilhelmine way of dressing with a high collar made him resemble a hamster, giving him a nickname that he hated; more broadly, the nickname suggested that he was not being taken as seriously as he would have liked. By 1932, Baron Thilo von Wilmowsky, who was married to Barbara von Krupp, the younger sister of Bertha von Krupp and was widely regarded as the spokesman for the Krupp family, was seeking to oust Hugenberg as the DNVP leader, convinced that his utter lack of charisma and charm was leading the party to disaster. A group of Hanoverian industrialists offered 100,000 Reichsmarks to assist anyone was willing to try to depose Hugenberg. Other industrialists such as Friedrich Springorum of the Ruhr were still committed to Hugenberg, albeit only on the negative grounds that to depose Hugenberg would split the DNVP even more. The steel magnate Fritz Thyssen abandoned the DNVP for the NSDAP, issuing a statement blaming all of the problems in the Harzburg Front on Hugenberg, and claimed that Hitler was the best man to end the Weimar Republic, which was why he had joined the NSDAP. Seeing his plans unravel inspired Hugenberg to write in a letter to Leo Wegener on 15 March 1932 that he was not a leader, but a &quot;chicken ladder&quot;, a reference to the German proverb &quot;life is a chicken ladder – shit on from top to bottom&quot;.

In the election for the Prussian &quot;Landtag&quot; on 24 April 1932, Hugenberg campaigned for a NSDAP-DNVP coalition, stating in a speech on 21 April 1932: &quot;We owe it to youth and to our children, to stress loudly and clearly in this campaign that we are not National Socialists and that the National Socialists alone on their own and without us are unable to solve the problems of our time.&quot; Despite his appeal, DNVP voters deserted their party for the Nazis in massive numbers, with the DNVP suffering a 56% decline in their share of the vote compared to the last Prussian election of 1928. By contrast, the Nazis went from having 8 seats in the Prussian &quot;Landtag&quot; to having 162 seats. As Prussia was the largest and most populous of Germany&#x27;s states, the Prussian election was widely taken as a sign that the Nazis had replaced the DNVP as the main party of the right.

Together with the German People&#x27;s Party, the DNVP was the only party in the that supported the new government led by Franz von Papen, and though three ministers in the new cabinet were DNVP members, Hugenberg himself was excluded. General von Bredow, the right-hand man of General Kurt von Schleicher, the mastermind who created the new Papen government, wrote in a memo that Hugenberg&#x27;s &quot;appearance, his speeches, his intractability&quot; caused most people to naturally hate him, and keeping him out of the Papen cabinet would be an advantage. As Papen was not a member of any party after he resigned from the Centre Party, Hugenberg during the first election campaign in the summer of 1932 presented voting for the DNVP as the best way to vote for Papen. As Papen was an extremely unpopular chancellor, this strategy was a disaster, and in the election on 31 July 1932, the DNVP suffered its worse result ever, winning only 5.9% of the vote, giving the DNVP only 36 seats in the . By contrast, the NSDAP had its best result ever in a free election, winning 37% of the vote and 230 seats in the . Hugenberg, despite drubbing the DNVP had suffered in the election, remained optimistic. For Hugenberg, his politics of polarization had achieved their purpose by collapsing the &quot;middle&quot; in German politics as he had intended. Moreover, for him, the purpose of the &quot;national bloc&quot; was only a means to end &quot;the system&quot;, as he called the Weimar Republic, from below; now the presidential government headed by Papen offered the means to end the Weimar Republic from above. The possibility of an alliance between the Nazis and the Centre without the DNVP, which was openly discussed, led Hugenberg to condemn Hitler for using parliamentary methods. Leading ministers in the Papen cabinet such as Defense Minister General Kurt von Schleicher; Foreign Minister Konstantin von Neurath and Interior Minister Wilhelm von Gayl often met with Hugenberg in private to discuss policies that the DNVP might support, and Papen in a letter stated that he agreed with Hugenberg&#x27;s economic policies of cutting wages and protectionism.

When the met on 12 September 1932, Papen was defeated by the most overwhelming motion of no confidence ever in German history with 512 &quot;Reichstag&quot; members voting for the motion while only 42 voted against. At Papen&#x27;s request, Hindenburg dissolved the for new elections rather than allowing another government to be formed, and in the ensuing election campaign, Hugenberg took a strongly anti-Nazi line, portraying Hitler as irresponsible and dangerous. Hugenberg presented him as the foremost supporter of the Papen government, and the Hugenberg newspapers launched a sustained line of attack on the Nazis as opportunists who were willing to take Hugenberg&#x27;s money, but not his guidance. During the election, Hugenberg came under pressure to resign from within his party and from many of the industrialists, with Hugo Stinnes in a letter of 19 September 1932 stating: &quot;Hugenberg is certainly right, but he cannot inspire enthusiasm and that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s all about.&quot;

Hugenberg&#x27;s party had experienced a growth in support in the November 1932 election at the expense of the Nazis. Hugenberg once again declared his support for Papen&#x27;s presidential government and advised Hindenburg: &quot;I have not found Hitler to be very loyal to agreements; his whole manner of handling political affairs makes it very difficult to be able to entrust Hitler with political leadership. I would have very grave reservations against this.&quot; In December 1932, Hugenberg drew up plans for a presidential government to be headed by the popular mayor of Leipzig, Carl Goerdeler, in which Hugenberg was to act as &quot;economic dictator&quot;. As part of his plans, Hugenberg drew up a list of 13 &quot;Urgent Measures&quot; to impose totalitarian control, with all opposition to be considered treason, censorship to be imposed, strikes made illegal, and the police to be given power to take people into &quot;protective custody&quot; without charges. At the same time, Hugenberg wrote Hitler a letter suggesting that the Nazis take part as cabinet ministers in this proposed government. At a secret meeting between Hugenberg and Hitler, a reconciliation of sorts was agreed upon. Hugenberg hoped to harness the Nazis for his own ends once again, and as such he dropped his attacks on them for the campaign for the March 1933 election.

==Hitler&#x27;s rise to power==
=== Negotiations with Papen and Hitler ===
In early January 1933, Chancellor Kurt von Schleicher developed plans for an expanded coalition government, to include not only Hugenberg, but also dissident Nazi Gregor Strasser and Centre Party politician Adam Stegerwald. Although Hugenberg had designs on a return to government, his hatred of trade union activity meant that he had no intention of working with Stegerwald, the head of the Catholic Trade Union movement. When Schleicher refused to exclude Stegerwald from his plans, Hugenberg broke off negotiations.

Hugenberg&#x27;s main confidant, Reinhold Quaatz, had, despite being half-Jewish, pushed for Hugenberg to follow a more path and work with the Nazi Party, and after the collapse of the Schleicher talks, this was the path he followed. In Germany at the time, there were no public opinion polls (an American invention that only crossed the Atlantic later in the 1930s), and state elections were treated as the best barometer of public opinion. In the election held on 11 January 1933 in the small and mostly rural and Protestant state of Lippe, the DNVP fared badly, losing 4,000 votes while the Nazis gained 5,000 votes compared to the last Lippe election. Although Lippe was only a small state, the election result was taken as a sign that the Nazis had regained the momentum that they had lost with the most recent election. Moreover, after almost five years as DNVP leader, Hugenberg was deeply frustrated and angry with his failure to achieve power despite all his efforts, and he became more desperate in this regard. Knowing that many people in his party wanted to see him resign, Hugenberg felt besieged. He wrote to Wegener on 2 January 1933: &quot;I see the difficulties growing all around...I myself am growing older and often do not [know] how the difficulties should be overcome.&quot; Hugenberg desired a presidential government that would carry out the &quot;urgent measures&quot; he had envisioned, and although he initially wanted Goerdeler appointed chancellor, he was prepared to accept either Papen or Schleicher as a substitute.

Hugenberg and Hitler met on 17 January 1933, and Hugenberg suggested that they both enter the cabinet of Kurt von Schleicher, a proposal rejected by Hitler, who would not move from his demands for the chancellorship. Hitler did agree in principle to allow Schleicher to serve under him as Defense minister, although Hugenberg warned the Nazi leader that as long as Paul von Hindenburg was president, Hitler would never be chancellor. A further meeting between the two threatened to derail any alliance after Hugenberg rejected Hitler&#x27;s demands for Nazi control over the interior ministries of Germany and Prussia, but by this time Franz von Papen had come round to the idea of Hitler as chancellor, and he worked hard to persuade the two leaders to come together.

During the negotiations between Franz von Papen and president Paul von Hindenburg, Hindenburg had insisted that Hugenberg be given the ministries of Economics and Agriculture, both at national level and in Prussia, as a condition of Hitler becoming chancellor, something of a surprise given the President&#x27;s well publicized dislike of Hugenberg. Hugenberg, eager for a share of power, agreed to the plan, and continued to believe that he could use Hitler for his own ends, telling the &quot;Stahlhelm&quot; leader Theodor Duesterberg that &quot;we&#x27;ll box Hitler in&quot;. On 27 January 1933, Hugenberg met with Hitler when he was informed Papen was now supporting a cabinet with Hitler as chancellor and Papen as vice-chancellor. Hugenberg could either realize his long sought dream of being the &quot;economic dictator&quot; or go into the opposition; he was inclined to the former. On 29 January, Papen met Hugenberg to tell him that he could be the &quot;economic dictator&quot; in a Hitler cabinet, a proposal that Hugenberg&#x27;s deputy Otto Schmidt-Hanover dubbed &quot;an attractive offer&quot;. Papen&#x27;s assurances that Hitler would be &quot;boxed in&quot; since the majority of the cabinet would not be Nazis, coupled with the chance to be &quot;economic dictator&quot; led Hugenberg to accept Hitler as chancellor and join the new government.

=== Member of the Hitler cabinet ===

Hugenberg agreed to join the Hitler government with the understanding that there would be no new elections, and upon waiting to be sworn in by President Hindenburg, he first learned that Hitler was planning to call new elections, precipitating a lengthy shouting match with Hitler. The chief of the presidential chancellery, Otto Meißner was forced to appear at the president&#x27;s office to relay that Hindenburg had been forced to wait an extra half-hour and was threatening to call off the swearing-in ceremony. Papen mediated the dispute, stating that the matter of new elections would be considered after the new government was sworn in. Hugenberg initially rejected Hitler&#x27;s plans to immediately call a fresh election, fearing the damage such a vote might inflict on his own party but, after being informed by Otto Meißner that the plan had Hindenburg&#x27;s endorsement, and by Papen that Schleicher was preparing to launch a military coup, he acceded to Hitler&#x27;s wishes. Hugenberg vigorously campaigned for the NSDAP–DNVP alliance, although other leading members within his party expressed fears over socialist elements and Nazi rhetoric. They appealed for a non-party dictatorship, but Hitler ignored their pleas.

Knowing of Hugenberg&#x27;s strong anti-Polish tendencies, the Polish ambassador, Alfred Wysocki, reported to the Polish Foreign Minister, Jozef Beck, that the most dangerous member of the cabinet of the new government was not Hitler, but rather Hugenberg. Hugenberg, who served jointly as the and Prussian ministers of economics and agriculture, and boasted of his plans to be &quot;economic dictator&quot;, was widely seen as the dominant minister in the new government. The French ambassador André François-Poncet reported to Paris &quot;in the association of the three men [Hitler, Papen and Hugenberg]...the least dangerous, the least troublesome is certainly not M. Hugenberg&quot;. Hugenberg named Paul Bang, the economic expert of the Pan-German League, as the state secretary (the number two man) in the Economics ministry. Bang was noted for his &quot;autarkic ideas and racist fanaticism&quot; and proved more interested in anti-Semitic laws than in the economy. The man whom Hugenberg named as state secretary in the Agriculture ministry, Hans-Joachim von Rohr, proved more interested in his portfolio, but in common with many other people found Hugenberg a difficult man to work with.

Hugenberg made no effort to stop Hitler&#x27;s ambition of becoming a dictator; he himself was authoritarian by inclination. On 2 February 1933, Hitler asked Hindenburg to dissolve the for new elections, a request that was granted. In a statement to the press, the new government announced with no sense of irony that the elections were necessary to &quot;end the loss of honor and freedom&quot; in Germany said to have started with the November revolution of 1918. Hitler wanted a new to pass the Enabling Act, a special emergency law that would allow the chancellor to govern via decree instead of the . In an editorial published in all his newspapers, Hugenberg defended the new government as necessary to defend the &quot;Christian conservative way of life&quot; against the forces of &quot;atheism and liberalism, socialism and Marxism&quot; and to return to the &quot;pure state&quot; that operated &quot;according to the Prussian tradition&quot;. Though he could not attack his coalition ally too much, Hugenberg argued that his supporters should vote DNVP because the Nazis had &quot;not unambiguously recognized the principles of private economy&quot;. At a rally on 11 February 1933 attended by Papen and the leader Franz Seldte, Hugenberg announced the formation of the &quot;Battle Front Black-White-Red&quot;, saying the &quot;national movement advanced in two columns&quot;, one being the Nazis and the other being the &quot;proper right, the Battle Front Black-White-Red, the national bourgeoise of the best tradition&quot;. Hugenberg used his control of UFA in the election, having UFA cinemas show newsreels that emphasized his role in the new government. During the election, UFA cinemas played films that were markedly nationalist.

When the was burned down on 28 February 1933 in act of arson committed by the Dutch communist Marinus van der Lubbe who had decided to burn down the as an act of political protest, Hugenberg agreed with Hitler&#x27;s claim that the fire was part of a Communist plot. In a speech given right after the fire, Hugenberg spoke of the need for &quot;draconian measures&quot; against Communists and of &quot;exterminating the hotbeds in which Bolshevism can flourish&quot;, adding that &quot;in these earnest times there can no longer be any half measure ...no compromise, no cowardice&quot;. Along with the other DNVP members of the cabinet, he voted for the Reichstag Fire Decree of 1933, which effectively wiped out civil liberties. The election of 5 March 1933 was by Hugenberg&#x27;s own admission a &quot;failure&quot; as the DNVP won only 3.1 million votes compared to the NSDAP which won 17 million votes. Under the Reichstag Fire Decree, Hitler had banned the German Communist Party (KPD), which meant that even without the DNVP the Nazis still had a majority in the new . Hugenberg was quietly concerned what Hitler might do if the passed the Enabling Act, and tried to include some amendments intended to limit Hitler&#x27;s power, only to be undercut by Hindenburg and by calls from within his own party to merge with the Nazi party. Hugenberg together with the rest of the DNVP Reichstag members voted for the Enabling Act, which Hugenberg rationalized on the grounds that the activation of the Enabling Act referred to the &quot;present government&quot;, which Hugenberg took to mean that Hitler could not dismiss him from the cabinet. Of the all members of the , only the Social Democrats voted against the Enabling Act (the KPD having already been banned).

==Removal from politics==
In the elections, Hugenberg&#x27;s DNVP captured 52 seats in the Reichstag, although any hope that these seats could ensure influence for the party evaporated with the passing of the Enabling Act of 1933 (which the DNVP supported) soon after the vote. Nevertheless, Hugenberg was Minister of the Economy in the new government and was also appointed Minister of Agriculture in the Nazi cabinet, largely due to the support his party enjoyed amongst the north German landowners. Papen, who envisioned himself as a check on Hitler, proved to be too superficial a personality for such a role while Hugenberg, who usually worked 14 hours a day, proved himself to be too involved in the intricacies of his portfolios to offer an effective check. Hugenberg, who refused to hire a secretary and wrote all of his lengthy memos by hand as he did not know how to use a typewriter, proved to be a stubborn and unlikable man, whom even the other conservative ministers found difficult to deal with. Hugenberg fancied himself the &quot;economic dictator&quot;, but at cabinet meetings the other conservative ministers such as Papen, Foreign Minister Baron Konstantin von Neurath and Defense Minister General Werner von Blomberg all objected to Hugenberg&#x27;s plans for an autarkic economy as unworkable and likely to isolate Germany internationally. Neurath, an experienced diplomat who had previously served as the ambassador in London and Rome, argued that the principal danger from abroad was the prospect of a &quot;preventive war&quot; from France. To end this prospect, Neurath argued that Germany for the moment needed to present itself as a more or less cooperative member of the international community, and that the economic policies advocated by Hugenberg were likely to cost Germany goodwill at a time when goodwill was much needed.

As Minister, Hugenberg declared a temporary moratorium on foreclosures, cancelled some debts and placed tariffs on some widely produced agricultural goods in order to stimulate the sector. As a move to protect dairy farming, he also placed limits on margarine production, although this move saw a rapid increase in the price of butter and margarine and made Hugenberg an unpopular figure outside of the farming community, hastening the inevitable departure of the non-Nazi from the cabinet. The DNVP for its all hostility towards liberalism was deeply committed to the (Rule of Law) and unaccustomed to dealing with Nazi dynamism and contempt for laws, as the Nazis tended to act illegally and present a to their DNVP allies, who meekly accepted what had been done. On 17 May 1933, Hugenberg met with Hindenburg to complain that the Nazis forced some civil servants who were DNVP members out of their jobs or alternatively forced them to join the NSDAP. Hindenburg proved to be uninterested and told Hugenberg of his belief &quot;that the Chancellor has the best intentions and with clean hands works in the interest of the Fatherland and in the spirit of justice&quot;. Hindenburg conceded that some of the Nazis were acting illegally, but told Hugenberg that he would take no action because this was a &quot;critical time&quot; and one must remember &quot;what a national upsurge the new movement has brought us&quot;.

Meanwhile, in June 1933, Hitler was forced to disavow the plan Hugenberg proposed while attending the London World Economic Conference, that a program of German colonial expansion in both Africa and Eastern Europe was the best way of ending the Great Depression, which created a major storm abroad. Hugenberg argued in a speech given in London on 16 June 1933 that Germany needed the return of all its former colonies in Africa in order to &quot;open up for a (nation without space) areas which could provide space for the settlement of its vigorous race and construct great works of peace&quot;. Both the French and Soviet governments formally submitted notes of protest, the French government because of the demand to return the former colonies in Africa, while the Soviet government objected to the fact that the Soviet Union was the that Hugenberg had in mind for German colonization. In an attempt to contain the damage caused by Hugenberg, Neurath issued a statement to the British press, saying these were merely the &quot;private&quot; views of the Economics minister. Rather than accept the rebuke, Hugenberg chose to issue a statement claiming he was speaking on behalf of the German government, an action that made the German delegation appear to be &quot;ridiculous&quot;, as Neurath complained at a subsequent cabinet meeting. Neurath told the cabinet that &quot;a single member cannot simply overlook the objections of the others&quot; and that Hugenberg &quot;either did not understand these objections, which were naturally clothed in polite form, or he did not want to understand them&quot;. The fact that Hugenberg chose to engage in a vendetta with Neurath over the conflicting press releases issued in London instead of dropping the matter as Neurath had urged him to do, made him appear very petty and spiteful and cost him whatever sympathy he might had enjoyed from the other conservative cabinet ministers. In a further blow, during his time in London, the party had disbanded both the , the para-military wing of the DNVP and its youth wing, the Bismarck Youth. Hugenberg&#x27;s fate was sealed when the Prussian State Secretary Fritz Reinhardt, ostensibly a subordinate to Hugenberg as Minister of Economy, presented a work-creation plan to the cabinet. The policy was supported by every member except Hugenberg.

An increasingly isolated figure, Hugenberg was finally forced to resign from the cabinet after a whisper campaign against him to remove him from power. He announced his formal resignation on 29 June 1933, and he was replaced by others who were loyal to the Nazi Party, Kurt Schmitt in the Economics Ministry and Richard Walther Darré in the Agriculture Ministry. A &quot;Friendship Agreement&quot; was signed between the Nazis and the DNVP immediately afterwards, the terms of which effectively dissolved the Nationalists, with members urged to join the Nazi Party. Indeed, the German National Front (DNF), as the DNVP had officially been called since May 1933, had officially dissolved itself on 27 June. Hugenberg signed a written agreement to dissolve the DNF in return for which Hitler promised that civil servants who were DNF members would be recognized as &quot;full and legally equal co-fighters&quot; and to release those party members in jail. Hugenberg&#x27;s last statement to the party&#x27;s executive committee was that &quot;we all have cause to go home and to crawl into our closets or go into the woods&quot;.

Although driven from his cabinet post, Hugenberg was, along with Papen and other former DNVP and Centre Party members, included on the Nazi list of candidates for the November 1933 election. However, his stock with the Nazis had fallen so much that in December 1933 the Telegraph Union, the news agency owned by Hugenberg, was de facto taken over by the Propaganda Ministry and merged into a new German News Office. Hugenberg was allowed to remain in the Reichstag until 1945 as one of 22 so-called &quot;guest&quot; members who were officially designated as non-party representatives. Given that they shared the assembly with 639 Nazi deputies, and given that the Reichstag met on an increasingly infrequent basis in any event, independents like Hugenberg had no influence.

==Later years==
Although Hugenberg had lost the Telegraph Union early on, he retained most of his media interests until 1943 when the Eher Verlag purchased his Scherl House. Hugenberg did not let them go cheaply, however, as he negotiated a large portfolio of shares in the Rhenish-Westphalian industries in return for his cooperation. Hugenberg last saw Hitler in February 1935, when he presented a plan to replace rental housing with condominiums, which went nowhere. By 1935, Hugenberg owned only the Scherl newspapers and UFA, which gave him an annual income of 500,000 . The Scherl newspapers such as the and continued to be published under the Third Reich and sold well. The negotiations for the forced sale of the Scherl house were conduced by the Economics minister, Walther Funk, who essentially told Hugenberg that he had to sell the Scherl newspapers, but that they would pay any price he asked for. Shortly after the sale in 1944, a British bombing raid wrecked the newspaper plant where the Scherl papers were published. Hugenberg&#x27;s son was killed in action on the Eastern Front; characteristically he refused to express any grief in public lest he be accused of weakness.

At the end of the war, Hugenberg was living at his estate in Rohbraken in Lippe, which ended up being in the British occupation zone. Hugenberg was arrested by British military police on 28 September 1946, and his remaining assets were frozen. Hugenberg was initially detained after the war, but in 1949 a Denazification court at Detmold adjudged him a &quot;Mitläufer&quot; (&quot;fellow traveller&quot;) rather than a Nazi, meaning that he was allowed to keep his property and business interests. Hugenberg spent the last years of his life denying any responsibility for the Nazi regime, continuing to insist that he had always acted correctly and that he had nothing to be ashamed of. He died in Kükenbruch (now part of Extertal) near Detmold on 12 March 1951, having only the company of a nurse, as he wished his family not to see him in his death throes.

<text>Jordanhill (, ) is an affluent area of the West End of the city of Glasgow, Scotland. The area consists largely of terraced housing dating from the early to mid 20th century, with some detached and semi-detached homes and some modern apartments.

Jordanhill College of Education and then the University of Strathclyde faculty of education were formerly in the area and the associated school has a high reputation.

==History==
The area was previously part of the Jordanhill Estate within the parish of Renfrew centred on Jordanhill House. 

===Jordanhill Estate:1546-1913===
====Crawfords of Jordanhill====

In 1546 Lawrence Crawford of Kilbirnie founded a chaplainry at Drumry, and to sustain it endowed it with the freehold ownership of land at Jordanhill, which then accumulated rent at a rate of £5 per annum. His sixth son Thomas Crawford was a soldier who led the 1571 capture of Dumbarton Castle, who had previously acquired the lands at Jordanhill from the chaplain of Drumry in 1562. There he built a house, possibly on or close to the foundations of an original hunting lodge. In the 18th century, one of his descendants also called Lawrence Crawford extended and refurbished the old house, and laid out the original garden scheme and associated orchards.

====Houstons of Jordanhill====
In 1750 the Crawford family sold the estate to Tobacco Lords Alexander Houston, whose family was also forced to sell the estate in 1800 after his business got into trouble, to James Smith of merchants Smith &amp; Leitch.

====Smiths of Jordanhill====
The third son of a Tobacco Lord from Craigend, James&#x27;s two elder brothers having travelled to Virginia and North Carolina in the 1760s had noted the growing civil uprising warning of the forthcoming American War of Independence, and refocused their family&#x27;s merchant business on trade with the West Indies. By the early 19th century, and after the death of their father, all three sons could afford to retire. As third son, James had no access to the family&#x27;s landed estate, and so bought Jordanhill for £14,000 in 1800. He then spent a further £4,000 extending and modernising the manor house. By 1809, the estate was sustained by its four associated farms of Whiteinch, Windyedge, Woodend and Anniesland. Having married Mary Wilson that year (granddaughter of Alexander Wilson and niece of Patrick Wilson), Smith improved access to the main house by gravelling the road to the Anniesland toll road, which is now known as Crow Road. In 1821, with four children and a pregnant wife, after the purchase of Gartnavel farm he remodelled the existing house, and also built a stone pillar in direct line between his favourite window in the manor house library and the spire of Renfrew Parish Church. A keen leisure sailor, in 1827 Smith bought the Baths Hotel at Helensburgh. With seven children, after two of his daughters caught tuberculosis, the family relocated temporarily to Portugal and rented out the house for five years. After the death of both daughters, the family returned to the estate in 1846, but in 1847 Mrs. Smith died of pneumonia. Comfortable but with less of a fortune, Smith devoted his remaining twenty years to church works and supporting his children in their endeavours.

After the death of his father in 1866, his son Archibald Smith inherited the by now neglected Jordanhill estate. A qualified barrister who lived in London with his wife and three children, he devoted his spare time to working on the problems of the deviation of the navigational compass associated with the newly developed iron ships. In 1862 he published patents and papers to solve these, which brought him the Gold Medal of the Royal Society. Smith left most of the management of the estate to its staff, which generated £4,500 of income across its core holding, of which £3,000 came from the quickly diminishing coal mines and ironstone workings leased on the former farmlands to the Monkland Iron and Steel Co. An 1872 government award of £2,000 for his compass research allowed him to replace the worst houses on the estate with new homes, today known as Compass Cottages in Anniesland Road. On his early death in 1872, to pay off death duties and the accrued debts of the estate, his wife sold of much of the estate&#x27;s former farmlands for housing development north of the Glasgow, Yoker and Clydebank Railway.

After his mother&#x27;s death in 1913, James Parker Smith inherited the estate. Educated at Winchester College and Trinity College, Cambridge, like his father he qualified as a barrister. After marriage to his cousin, he had devoted himself to politics, becoming Liberal Unionist MP for Glasgow Partick in 1890. In January 1900, Smith had been appointed assistant private secretary (unpaid) to Joseph Chamberlain, Secretary of State for the Colonies. After losing his seat in 1906, like his mother he began selling off more pieces of land four housing development, including the former Gartnavel farm to the Royal Lunatic Asylum. Approached by the university which was looking for a site on which to establish a unified teacher training college, in 1913 Parker Smith agreed sale of the residual estate.

Following the death of Archibald Colin Hamilton Smith in Australia on 5 June 1971, the sixth generation of the family who died without issue, the Smith family papers dealing with the Jordanhill Estate were donated to the Glasgow City Archives at the Mitchell Library. Many of the Smith family are buried in the graveyard surrounding Renfrew Parish Church.

On 25 June 2007, Lord Lyon King of Arms recognized Michael Babington Smith, the grandson of Archibald Colin Hamilton Smith as successor to his grandfather as Representer of the House of Smith of Jordanhill and therefore, Michael Babington Smith of Jordanhill.

=== Later history ===

Before the twentieth century, Jordanhill was a poor area, similar to neighbouring Knightswood, with mining for coal at Skaterigg. The building of more affluent residences was coincidental with the expansion of Glasgow and the construction of a commuter railway (similar to Bearsden in the 1870s).

The site of the house was sold to Jordanhill Teacher Training College, and is now the home of the Strathclyde University Faculty Of Education. The area consists largely of terraced housing dating from the early to mid 20th century, with some detached and semi-detached homes and some modern apartments.

Jordanhill, Temple and Knightswood have been linked to stories of the Knights Templar; but there is no evidence for their presence in this area. When asked, the Lord Lyon King of Arms rebutted a proposal to include the Maltese cross of the Knights of St. John in the crest of Jordanhill College. Jordanhill may be related to the family name &quot;Jardine&quot;.

==Amenities==
There are a number of parks in Jordanhill and the immediate vicinity, as well as large playing fields on the Jordanhill Campus. Jordanhill is directly adjacent to Victoria Park, one of the largest green spaces in Glasgow and home to the Fossil Grove, an area of fossilized prehistoric tree stumps.

The area has excellent transport links. Jordanhill railway station has regular local train services to central Glasgow on the North Clyde and Argyle lines, and regular bus services are provided by First Glasgow. The Clyde Tunnel is located nearby, giving road access to the south of the city.

There are two pubs in the area, both are situated on Crow Road, near the railway station.

This area used to be home to a branch of The Jolly Giant Toy Superstores, based on Crow Road.

==Education==

Jordanhill School is located on Chamberlain Road at the foot of the hill on which Jordanhill College sits, and was formerly the College&#x27;s training school. It is now a state comprehensive school. The school is unique in the Scottish state sector in that it contains both Primary and Secondary departments, providing education for children from 4 to 18, and in that it has Grant Maintained status and is independent from local government control. It had previously been an independent demonstration school for Jordanhill College. Private school the High School of Glasgow is also located in the Jordanhill vicinity.

Saint Thomas Aquinas Secondary School is a Catholic secondary school located on Mitre Road in the newer part of Jordanhill. It has several feeder primary schools, including Corpus Christi (Knightswood), Notre Dame (Dowanhill), St Pauls (Whiteinch), St. Peter&#x27;s (Partick), St. Brendan&#x27;s (Yoker), St. Patrick&#x27;s in (Anderston), St. Clare&#x27;s (Drumchapel) and St. Ninian&#x27;s (Blairdardie).

==Places of worship==
There are two churches in Jordanhill, both located on Woodend Drive, off Crow Road: Jordanhill Parish Church (Church of Scotland) and All Saints Church (Episcopalian). Both churches are used for a variety of community and social events, in addition to regular worship, and All Saints is also home to Westbourne Gardens Nursery School. The 72nd and 178th Glasgow Scouts are based in the area, as well as 130th and the 272nd Glasgow Boys&#x27; Brigades.

<doc id="239462" wikidata="Q424304" url="?curid=239462" title="Phosphodiesterase">
<text>A phosphodiesterase (PDE) is an enzyme that breaks a phosphodiester bond. Usually, &quot;phosphodiesterase&quot; refers to cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases, which have great clinical significance and are described below. However, there are many other families of phosphodiesterases, including phospholipases C and D, autotaxin, sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase, DNases, RNases, and restriction endonucleases (which all break the phosphodiester backbone of DNA or RNA), as well as numerous less-well-characterized small-molecule phosphodiesterases.

The cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases comprise a group of enzymes that degrade the phosphodiester bond in the second messenger molecules cAMP and cGMP. They regulate the localization, duration, and amplitude of cyclic nucleotide signaling within subcellular domains. PDEs are therefore important regulators of signal transduction mediated by these second messenger molecules.

==History==
These multiple forms (isoforms or subtypes) of phosphodiesterase were isolated from rat brain using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the early 1970s by Weiss and coworkers, and were soon afterward shown to be selectively inhibited by a variety of drugs in brain and other tissues, also by Weiss and coworkers.

The potential for selective phosphodiesterase inhibitors to be used as therapeutic agents was predicted in the 1970s by Weiss and coworkers. This prediction has now come to pass in a variety of fields (e.g. sildenafil as a PDE5 inhibitor and Rolipram as a PDE4 inhibitor).

==Nomenclature and classification==
The PDE nomenclature signifies the &quot;PDE family&quot; with an Arabic numeral, then a capital letter denotes the &quot;gene in that family&quot;, and a second and final Arabic numeral then indicates the &quot;splice variant&quot; derived from a single gene (e.g., PDE1C3: family 1, gene C, splicing variant 3).

The superfamily of PDE enzymes is classified into 11 families, namely PDE1-PDE11, in mammals. The classification is based on:
* amino acid sequences
* substrate specificities
* regulatory properties
* pharmacological properties
* tissue distribution

Different PDEs of the same family are functionally related despite the fact that their amino acid sequences can show considerable divergence. PDEs have different substrate specificities. Some are cAMP-selective hydrolases (PDE4, 7 and 8); others are cGMP-selective (PDE5, 6, and 9). Others can hydrolyse both cAMP and cGMP (PDE1, 2, 3, 10, and 11). PDE3 is sometimes referred to as cGMP-inhibited phosphodiesterase. Although PDE2 can hydrolyze both cyclic nucleotides, binding of cGMP to the regulatory GAF-B domain will increase cAMP affinity and hydrolysis to the detriment of cGMP. This mechanism, as well as others, allows for cross-regulation of the cAMP and cGMP pathways. PDE12 cleaves 2&#x27;,5&#x27;-phosphodiester bond linking adenosines of the 5&#x27;-triphosphorylated oligoadenylates. PDE12 is not a member of the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase superfamily that contains PDE1 through PDE11.

==Clinical significance==
Phosphodiesterase enzymes have been shown to be different in different types of cells, including normal and leukemic lymphocytes and are often targets for pharmacological inhibition due to their unique tissue distribution, structural properties, and functional properties.

Inhibitors of PDE can prolong or enhance the effects of physiological processes mediated by cAMP or cGMP by inhibition of their degradation by PDE.

Sildenafil (Viagra) is an inhibitor of cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5, which enhances the vasodilatory effects of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum and is used to treat erectile dysfunction. Sildenafil is also currently being investigated for its myo- and cardioprotective effects, with particular interest being given to the compound&#x27;s therapeutic value in the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Paraxanthine, the main metabolite of caffeine, is another cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor which inhibits PDE9, a cGMP preferring phosphodiesterase. PDE9 is expressed as high as PDE5 in the corpus cavernosum.

===Pharmacological effect of PDE inhibitors===
PDE inhibitors have been identified as new potential therapeutics in areas such as pulmonary arterial hypertension, coronary heart disease, dementia, depression, asthma, COPD, protozoal infections (including malaria) and schizophrenia.

PDE also are important in seizure incidence. For example, PDE compromised the antiepileptic activity of adenosine. In addition, using of a PDE inhibitor (pentoxifylline) in pentylenetetrazole-induced seizure indicated the antiepileptic effect by increasing the time latency to seizure incidence and decreasing the seizure duration in vivo.

Cilostazol (Pletal) inhibits PDE3. This inhibition allows red blood cells to be more able to bend. This is useful in conditions such as intermittent claudication, as the cells can maneuver through constricted veins and arteries more easily.

Dipyridamole inhibits PDE-3 and PDE-5. This leads to intraplatelet accumulation of cAMP and/or cGMP, inhibiting platelet aggregation.

Zaprinast inhibits the growth of asexual blood-stage malaria parasites (&quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot;) &quot;in vitro&quot; with an ED50 value of 35 μM, and inhibits PfPDE1, a &quot;P. falciparum&quot; cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase, with an IC50 value of 3.8 μM.

Xanthines such as caffeine and theobromine are cAMP-phosphodiesterase inhibitors. However, the inhibitory effect of xanthines on phosphodiesterases are only seen at dosages higher than what people normally consume.

Sildenafil, Tadalafil and Vardenafil are PDE-5 inhibitors and are widely used in the treatment of erectile dysfunction.

== Other applications ==
Recently a PDE was found to break down and release human body grime found on laundry. With the help of this newly discovered nuclease, the yellow stains and odors, that normally remain on clothes with classical detergents, can easily be removed.

<doc id="239463" wikidata="Q122377" url="?curid=239463" title="Micheline Calmy-Rey">
<text>Micheline Anne-Marie Calmy-Rey (born 8 July 1945) is a Swiss politician who served as a Member of the Swiss Federal Council from 2003 to 2011. A member of the Social Democratic Party (SP/PS), she was the head of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs during her tenure as a Federal Councillor. She was President of the Swiss Confederation twice, in 2007 and 2011.

==Early life and education==
Calmy-Rey was born in Sion in the canton of Valais on 8 July 1945 to Charles and Adeline Rey. She received her diploma in 1963 in Saint-Maurice and a licence degree in political science at the Graduate Institute of International Studies, Geneva, in 1968. While studying she married André Calmy; they have two children.

==Career==
Calmy-Rey established a small enterprise in the book distribution business. From 1981 to 1997 Calmy-Rey served as a representative in the Grand Conseil of the canton of Geneva as a member of the Social Democratic Party (PSS/SPS), and was president of the assembly during 1992–1993. She was president of the Geneva section of the party from 1986 to 1990 and again from 1993 to 1997. In 1997, Calmy-Rey was elected to the Conseil d&#x27;Etat of Geneva. In 2001, she became head of the finance department and president of the Conseil d&#x27;Etat of the canton.

She was elected on 4 December 2002 to the Federal Council, heading the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs from 2003 to 2011. Calmy-Rey is the fourth woman elected to the Federal Council in history. She was also elected Vice-President of Switzerland, a post she held for the calendar year of 2006 and the calendar year of 2010.

Calmy-Rey supports Switzerland joining the European Union and she is an Eminent Member of the Sergio Vieira de Mello Foundation. The project &quot;SAFFA 2020&quot; is also under her patronage and of the councillors (&quot;Bundesrat&quot;) Doris Leuthard, Simonetta Sommaruga and Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf.

Since 2016, Calmy-Rey has been a member of the board of the Global Leadership Foundation (chaired by Helen Clark), an organisation that works to support democratic leadership, prevent and resolve conflict through mediation and promote good governance in the form of democratic institutions, open markets, human rights and the rule of law. It does so by making available, discreetly and in confidence, the experience of former leaders to today&#x27;s national leaders. It is a not-for-profit organisation composed of former heads of government, senior governmental and international organization officials who work closely with heads of government on governance-related issues of concern to them.

She is a member of the board Geneva of GESDA (Geneva Science and Diplomacy Anticipator).

==Presidency==

On 1 January 2007, Calmy-Rey became the second female president of the Confederation in history, the first having been her predecessor on the Federal Council, Ruth Dreifuss. She was elected as president on 13 December 2006 by 147 votes. However, by Swiss tradition, it was a foregone conclusion she would be elected. She had been the longest-serving councillor not to have been president, and had served as vice-president for 2006.

As President of the Confederation, she presided over meetings of the Federal Council and carried out certain representative functions that would normally be handled by a head of state in other democracies, (though in Switzerland, the Federal Council as a whole is regarded as the head of state). She was also the highest-ranking official in the Swiss order of precedence, and had the power to act on behalf of the whole Council in emergency situations. However, in most cases she was merely &quot;prima inter pares&quot;, with no power above and beyond her six colleagues.

She had already handled most official visits abroad since being elected to the Federal Council; the head of the Department of Foreign Affairs traditionally carries out such visits.

Calmy-Rey was chosen as vice president for 2010, serving alongside Doris Leuthard. On 8 December 2010, she was chosen, for the second time, as president for 2011 (by 106 votes out of 189, this being the smallest margin in Swiss history) – the first time two women held the post in succession.
Calmy-Rey is a member of the Council of Women World Leaders, an International network of current and former women presidents and prime ministers whose mission is to mobilize the highest-level women leaders globally for collective action on issues of critical importance to women and equitable development.

She announced in September 2011 that she would resign from the government in the following December.

From 2012 to 2013, Calmy-Rey was a member of the High-Level Advisory Council of the President of the 67th Session of the United Nations General Assembly, Serbia&#x27;s then foreign minister Vuk Jeremić.

== Political views ==
Calmy-Rey is a member of the Socialist party of Switzerland and positions herself as pro-European. In February 2014 she stated that Switzerland should join the European Union to be included in the European political agenda on the continent. In 2016, she expressed concerns about the Brexit impact on the European sovereignty, but recommended that Switzerland opened up to Great Britain as the two countries now faced the same configuration towards the European political power.

In February 2020, Calmy-Rey joined around fifty former European prime ministers and foreign ministers in signing an open letter published by British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; to condemn U.S. President Donald Trump’s Middle East peace plan, saying it would create an apartheid-like situation in occupied Palestinian territory.

== Academic career ==
In May 2012 Calmy-Rey was appointed as invited professor et the University of Geneva (Global studies institute).

== Other assignments ==
* Member of the United Nations High-Level Panel on Global Sustainability. A report of the panel was published in February 2012.
* Member of the United Nations High-Level Panel on Global Response to Health Crisis . A report was published in January 2016.
* Membre of the council of the Global Leadership Foundation (GLF).
* Membre du conseil de la fondation GESDA (Geneva Science and Diplomacy Anticipator).

== Awards ==
* 2011: Prix Diaspora for her role in the recognition of Kosovo independence
* 2012: Medal of honour of Armenia
* 2012: Docteur honoris causa of the International University in Geneva
* 2014: Badge of the Order of Friendship in recognition of her contribution in the reinforcing of the friendship and cooperation between Russia and Switzerland.
* 2017: Citizen of honour of the city of Viti, Kosovo.

==Controversy==
According to the BBC, Calmy-Rey was &quot;widely criticised&quot; for putting on a headscarf to meet Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on 19 March 2008, even though it was acknowledged that she was simply following proper social protocol. While Socialist MP Liliane Maury Pasquier agreed that the Swiss representant had to respect foreign protocols, this sparked a negative remark from Socialist MP Maria Roth-Bernasconi. In response, Calmy-Rey stated that she was following protocol out of respect, and that had she not done so, she would not have been able to attend the meeting, which has been widely acknowledged.

Calmy-Rey also prompted controversy by attending the signing of a multibillion-dollar natural gas deal of a Swiss energy supply company with Iran. The United States had complained that Switzerland was sending the wrong message when Tehran was subject to UN sanctions. Calmy-Rey pointed out that gas exports were not subject to the UN sanctions. Both the Israeli government and international Jewish groups such as the World Jewish Congress strongly criticised the deal.

<doc id="239465" wikidata="Q643817" url="?curid=239465" title="Old Firm">
<text>The Old Firm is a collective name for the Scottish football clubs Celtic and Rangers, which are both based in Glasgow. The two clubs are the most successful and popular in Scotland, and the rivalry between them has become deeply embedded in Scottish culture. It has reflected and contributed to political, social and religious division and sectarianism in Scotland. As a result, matches between them have had an enduring appeal around the world.

Between them the two clubs are among the most trophied in the world, having won a combined 109 Scottish League championships (Rangers with 55 and Celtic with 54), 76 Scottish Cups (Celtic with 42 and Rangers with 34), and 50 Scottish League Cups (Rangers with 28 and Celtic with 22). Interruptions to their ascendancy have occurred rarely, mainly in the two decades after the Second World War from 1946 to 1965 when five other clubs won the league, and in the first half of the 1980s with the challenge of the New Firm of Aberdeen and Dundee United. Since the 1985–86 season, one half of the Old Firm has won the Scottish League every season, and in all but one of seventeen seasons between 1995–96 and 2011–12, both clubs finished in the top two places. 

In the early 2010s, Rangers endured financial difficulties, and its holding company was liquidated in 2012. Subsequently, the team had to apply for entry to the bottom (fourth) tier of the Scottish league. As a result of the liquidation, many Celtic supporters maintain that the current Rangers is distinct from the pre-2012 club, and the rivalry no longer exists under the Old Firm identity. Instead, they (and often Celtic themselves) use the more generic term Glasgow Derby to refer to the rivalry. While Rangers climbed back through the divisions, Celtic were champions in each of the next nine campaigns; Rangers won the title in 2020–21 to prevent a tenth for Celtic, which would have beaten a record set by them in the 1960s/70s and matched by Rangers in the 1980s/90s.

Celtic and Rangers have played each other 444 times in major competitions; both clubs have won 170 matches and 104 ended in a draw.

The clubs have large fan bases around Glasgow and Scotland and have supporters clubs in many towns throughout Scotland and Northern Ireland and in cities around the world. In 2005 the presence of Rangers and Celtic was estimated to be worth £120 million to the Scottish economy each year.
==Origin of &#x27;Old Firm&#x27;==
The origin of the term is unclear but may derive from the two clubs&#x27; initial match in which the commentators referred to the teams as &quot;like two old, firm friends&quot;, or alternatively may stem from a satirical cartoon published in &#x27;The Scottish Referee&#x27; sports newspaper prior to the 1904 Scottish Cup final between the sides, depicting an elderly man with a sandwich board reading &quot;Patronise The Old Firm: Rangers, Celtic Ltd&quot;, highlighting the mutual commercial benefits of their meetings. The name may also be a reference to these two teams being among the original eleven members of the Scottish Football League formed in 1890 (although others from that group, such as Heart of Midlothian and St Mirren, also continue to play at the highest level to this day).

At the turn of the 21st century, the two clubs jointly registered the &#x27;Old Firm&#x27; term at the Intellectual Property Office; it was confirmed this was still being renewed as a trademark in 2021.

==Rivalry and sectarianism==

The competition between the two clubs had roots in more than just a simple sporting rivalry. It has as much to do with Northern Ireland as Scotland and this can be seen in the flags, cultural symbols, and emblems of both clubs. It was infused with a series of complex disputes, sometimes centred on religion (Protestant and Catholic), Northern Ireland-related politics (Loyalist and Republican), national identity (British or Irish Scots), and social ideology (conservatism and socialism).

Another primary contributor to the intensity of the rivalry in the west of Scotland was that Rangers supporters are historically native Scots and Ulster Scots, and Celtic supporters are historically Irish-Scots. Although the confrontation between the two sets of supporters was often labelled as &#x27;Sectarianism&#x27;, &#x27;Native-Immigrant tension&#x27; was an equally accurate catalyst for hostility between the two teams&#x27; supports in Scotland. Rangers&#x27; traditional support was largely from the Protestant community, and for decades the club had an unwritten rule whereby they would not knowingly sign a player of the Catholic faith. The policy was decried by Graeme Souness when he became manager, and he brought ex-Celtic forward Mo Johnston to the club in a very public move away from the practice, which no longer continues. Celtic&#x27;s support was largely from those of Irish Roman Catholic backgrounds and while the club practiced no exclusion of Protestants and signed many of them to play for the team, there was a pro-Catholic mindset among some of the employees. One effect is that Scottish flags are rarer than might be expected amongst both sets of supporters; Celtic fans are more likely to wave the Irish tricolour while Rangers fans tend to wave the Union Jack.

Celtic were founded in 1887 on the promise that the club would deliver much-needed money and resources to a poverty-stricken Irish Catholic population in East Glasgow (although records indicated little of this income reached those causes) and quickly drew large crowds at their matches, becoming a symbol for that section of the local population which were marginalised in other areas of society and had previously shown little interest in the emerging sport. Rangers had been founded 15 years earlier in 1872 and had no particular religious leanings in their early decades, indeed they were described by the press as friends of Celtic in match reports at the turn of the 20th century. In that era Rangers had won three successive championships and expanded their stadium at great expense, only for one of the new wooden stands to collapse during a Scotland v England fixture in April 1902, killing 25 and injuring hundreds of others. The disaster forced the club to rebuild Ibrox for a second time and financed this by selling off their best players, with Celtic, in particular, taking advantage of the weakness to win six successive titles between 1905 and 1910 before Rangers returned to their previous strength. The sporting side of the rivalry was now established, with their meetings providing considerable financial benefit as seen in the Scottish Cup finals of 1904 (which appears to be the origin of the &#x27;Old Firm&#x27; term) and 1909 when they drew twice and a further replay was ordered, with supporters of both teams deciding to riot on the assumption the results were being fixed to make more money – amid multiple injuries and considerable damage to Hampden Park, the trophy was withheld.

The political aspect of the feud also developed in that period, with perhaps the most significant development occurring in 1912 when Belfast shipbuilders Harland and Wolff (a company which already had anti-Catholic hiring practices) set up a new yard in Glasgow due to instability in Ireland. Hundreds of Ulster Protestant workers, many of Scottish descent, also made the move, and they adopted Rangers – the closest large club to the Govan yard – as their new team. Other events such as World War I and the Easter Rising contributed to the club being adopted as a symbol of the Scottish establishment and of British Unionism in the face of Irish Catholic rebellion personified by the success of Celtic and from that time on, many across Scotland and Northern Ireland (and the diaspora of those communities in England, North America and elsewhere) became supporters of Rangers or Celtic over and above their local teams according to their own political and religious leanings, including polarised attitudes towards &#x27;The Troubles&#x27;.

Nevertheless, this dividing line seems to be blurred in 21st century Glasgow: religious adherence, in general, is falling, marriages between Protestants and Catholics have never been higher and the old certainties – the Rangers supporter voting Conservative and the Celtic supporter voting Labour — are no longer in evidence. In 2005 both Celtic and Rangers joined a project to tackle bigotry and sectarianism in sport, but there was little change in the behaviour and subsequent prosecution of the fans.

The majority of Rangers and Celtic supporters do not get involved in sectarianism, but serious incidents do occur with a tendency for the actions of a minority to dominate the headlines. The Old Firm rivalry fuelled many assaults on derby days, and some deaths in the past have been directly related to the aftermath of Old Firm matches. An activist group that monitors sectarian activity in Glasgow has reported that on Old Firm weekends, violent attacks increase ninefold over normal levels. An increase in domestic abuse can also be attributed to Old Firm fixtures.

A freedom of information request found that Strathclyde Police incurred costs of £2.4 million for the seven derbies played during the 2010–11 season, with the clubs only contributing £0.3 million towards that. Other high-profile games involving Rangers and Celtic incurred much lower costs. The reason for the disparity in costs and the contribution made is that Strathclyde Police had to increase its activity elsewhere in Glasgow and beyond, while the clubs were only responsible for costs incurred in the vicinity of their stadium. In a period between April 2016 and December 2017, when nine matches were contested (three each at the club&#x27;s stadiums and three at Hampden), more than £550,000 was spent by Celtic, Rangers, the SFA and the SPFL on policing inside the stadium alone. Rangers paid more than Celtic despite having a smaller capacity and a plan for the away support at Ibrox which required less of a &#x27;human barricade&#x27; of officers to separate the rival supporters than was necessary at Celtic Park.

In 2015, former Rangers player Brian Laudrup said that the Old Firm topped all of the rivalries he had played in, which included the Milan derby and the Fiorentina-Juventus meetings in Italy; ex-Celtic striker Henrik Larsson, who experienced El Clásico in Spain and De Klassieker in the Netherlands, has made similar comments. Jim Bett, who had already played in Iceland prior to joining Rangers in the 1980s and thereafter moved to Belgium, stated that he declined an opportunity to return to the Ibrox club due to the sectarianism associated with life as a footballer in the west of Scotland, in contrast to his positive experiences living abroad.

===Disorder within stadiums===
Hundreds of opposing fans fought an on-pitch battle in the aftermath of Celtic&#x27;s 1–0 victory in the 1980 Scottish Cup final at Hampden, fuelled by alcohol and armed with the cans and bottles. Despite previous instances of similar behaviour – less widespread and more speedily quelled, but still resulting in dozens of arrests – at the end of the 1965 Scottish League Cup final, 1969 Scottish Cup final and 1977 Scottish Cup final between the same teams at the same venue, a senior police officer on duty at the time estimated the number of his colleagues inside the stadium in 1980 was barely into double figures, with almost all the estimated 400 police outside Hampden dealing with expected disorder issues, and perimeter fencing assumed sufficient to keep the fans off the pitch. This remains one of the worst invasions onto a football pitch ever reported, and was instrumental in alcohol being banned from all football grounds in Scotland, a situation which was still in place 40 years on.

In January 1994, Rangers chairman David Murray announced that Celtic fans had been banned from Ibrox due to repeated instances of vandalism to the stadium which Celtic refused to take financial responsibility for. Only one fixture, which ended 1–1, was played before the ban was rescinded (the Scottish Football League passed a resolution preventing clubs from taking that action in future).

There was serious fan disorder during an Old Firm match played on a Sunday evening in May 1999 at Celtic Park, with the usual tensions heightened by the fact that Rangers could clinch the league title with victory (and it became clear that they would do so from the early stages of the match). Several objects were thrown by Celtic fans, one of which struck referee Hugh Dallas forcing the game to be stopped while he received medical treatment. With many of those in attendance having spent a full weekend drinking alcohol prior to the event, at least four Celtic fans invaded the field of play to confront Dallas during the game, and more missiles were thrown at players on the pitch after the game. Since the events of that day, Old Firm league matches have normally been played in the early afternoon and the possibility of an Old Firm title decider has been deliberately avoided.

Some supporters of both clubs, when interviewed, have conceded that they do not particularly enjoy the intense atmosphere of Old Firm matches.

===Incidents involving players===
Over the hundreds of matches played between the rivals, players and staff have been involved in many incidents beyond the usual bad tackles and red cards commonly associated with derby matches around the world; in the modern age of video footage, such incidents are more frequently observed, reviewed and scrutinised. In 1987, four players were charged by the police with breach of the peace for their conduct during a match at Ibrox and had to appear at court, with two (Chris Woods and Terry Butcher) convicted and fined. While warming up on the touchline at Celtic Park in January 1998, Rangers&#x27; Paul Gascoigne was caught on television reacting to verbal abuse from the stands by briefly miming the playing of a flute (representing &quot;The Sash&quot; and the typical repertoire of songs on an Orange walk, considered an offensive gesture by Celtic&#x27;s many supporters of an Irish Catholic background). Gascoigne, who had pleaded his ignorance of the situation after he made the same gesture in a friendly just after joining Rangers in 1995 and had been sent off on his last visit to Celtic six weeks earlier, was fined for the provocative act and left the club later that year. He has stated that he later received threats via telephone calls from persons purporting to be members of the IRA over his behaviour.

In 2000, after being sent off during an Old Firm match, Rangers midfielder Barry Ferguson was involved in a violent brawl with Celtic fans at a hotel later in the same evening; a year later, Ferguson (by now club captain) was sitting in the stand when he appeared to throw ice packs towards the Celtic dugout after Rangers conceded a late goal, however the referee missed the incident and no action was taken. In that same match, a Celtic supporter was photographed making an &#x27;aeroplane&#x27; gesture towards American Rangers player Claudio Reyna a few weeks after the September 11 attacks. A 2004 match at Ibrox which &quot;descended into even more mayhem and madness than usual&quot; led to a police enquiry over the conduct of the players and staff.

In February 2006, Celtic goalkeeper Artur Boruc was cautioned by the police for gestures he made to Rangers supporters during a match at Ibrox; six months later, it was clarified that this was for &quot;Conduct which appears to incite disorder&quot; rather than simply making the sign of the cross as he entered his area, as some had thought. He also blessed himself in the fixture in December of that year, annoying Rangers fans who saw it as a provocative act, although the police stated that no offence had been committed. Boruc, who became known as the &#x27;Holy Goalie&#x27; for his overt displays of his Catholic faith, escaped personal punishment in 2008 for displaying a t-shirt with the slogan &quot;God bless the Pope&quot; and an image of fellow Pole Pope John Paul II after an Old Firm win at Parkhead in April 2008, although Celtic faced scrutiny from FIFA as it was an unauthorised garment under their regulations on slogans. He was fined £500 and warned for (non-religious) gestures made towards Rangers fans in a defeat at the same venue in September of the same year. Prior to an international match between Northern Ireland and Poland in 2009, graffiti of a threatening nature mentioning Boruc appeared on walls in a Rangers-supporting area of Belfast.

In March 2011, an angry exchange took place on the touchline at Celtic Park between Celtic manager Neil Lennon and Rangers assistant coach Ally McCoist, requiring police officers to separate them, at the end of a match in which three players had also been dismissed; again captured on live television footage, the incident resulted in both men being banned from the dugout for misconduct. A &#x27;crisis meeting&#x27; was convened involving the clubs, the Scottish Government and Strathclyde Police some days later regarding the trend of violence among supporters away from the pitch increasing on Old Firm matchdays and concerns that incidents during the matches was a factor. The incident occurred during the tense environment of a season where seven Old Firm matches took place (including a League Cup final and a fight for the title eventually won by Rangers by one point).

===Visitor allocation, crushing incident===

During the 2018 close season, Rangers announced that they would be cutting the ticket allocation for Celtic fans at Ibrox from around 7,000 (the entire Broomloan Stand) to 800, situated in a corner where smaller travelling supports were usually accommodated, following a fan survey backing the proposal as well as an upturn in season ticket sales. In response, Celtic indicated they would do likewise, bringing to an end a long tradition of both clubs offering a generous proportion of their stadium to their rivals. The development was criticised by former players as diluting the famous atmosphere of the fixtures, although others praised the extra income the change would likely generate. In the first fixture at Celtic Park under the new arrangements, a combination of a larger home support, the need to retain segregation for the smaller away support and general unfamiliarity with the new arrangements led to an incident of crushing in the enclosed walkway behind the North Stand before kick off as supporters were directed to use the route to reach both of the end stands; several people scaled a high perimeter wall and fence to escape, and medical attention was required for five fans. Those involved expressed their anger afterwards regarding the arrangements and policing, with Celtic issuing an official apology.

Towards the end of the 2022–23 season, a dispute between the clubs over ticketing and supporter safety issues led to there being no away fans at all for the last two league fixtures, which was also the case throughout 2023–24 and, despite an agreement being reached in March 2024 to end the stalemate and allow a 5% (~2,500) visiting allocation at each stadium, continued into 2024–25 (the prolongation was blamed by Celtic on the unpredictability of renovations at Ibrox which caused some matches to be played at Hampden and others with reduced capacity, although it was highly likely the work would have been finished by the relevant date of 2 January 2025).

===Legislation===
From 1 March 2012, the police were given more powers to act against Sectarian acts at football matches through the new Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Scotland) Act 2012. The law was designed specifically to target the Old Firm rivalry by reducing the religious hatred between the two opposing sides. The Act created two new offences, one covering behaviour in and around football matches and the other related to posts sent by either electronic or postal methods. People convicted under the act could face up to five years imprisonment, a much higher sentence than was previously in place. It was hoped it would make it much easier to prosecute this misbehaviour, which had proved difficult in the past.

In March 2013 a protest by a number of Celtic fans took place to protest against the new laws and the subsequent match bans that a number of fans had received for breaking the Act. The protesters, known as the &quot;Green Brigade&quot;, had marched without police authority and the event was therefore cracked down on by local authorities resulting in thirteen arrests. The protestors claim that the police instigated the trouble that occurred at this march. Following the march, media coverage reported that the fans were growing further apart from the police than ever before. They claimed that the trust the fans hold with the police to work in cooperation with them is falling dramatically. The march that took place resulted in a number of complaints from both Celtic and Rangers fan groups that they were harassed by the police.

Labour MSP James Kelly introduced the &quot;Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Repeal) (Scotland) Bill&quot; in June 2017. Kelly had described the 2012 legislation as having &quot;completely failed to tackle sectarianism&quot; and as &quot;illiberal&quot; which &quot;unfairly targets football fans&quot;, and was &quot;condemned by legal experts, human rights organisations and equality groups&quot;. Professor Sir Tom Devine previously spoke of the Football Act as &quot;&quot;the most illiberal and counterproductive act passed by our young Parliament to date&quot; and a &quot;stain on the reputation of the Scottish legal system for fair dealing&quot;&quot;. Much was made of when a Sheriff described the law as &quot;mince&quot;.

After passing through the parliamentary process in early 2018, on 19 April the bill received royal assent, repealing the 2012 Act.

===Joint sponsorship===
Glasgow-based brewers Tennent&#x27;s were the primary commercial sponsor of both teams for several years; any local business that only sponsored one would likely lose half its customers. Previously, glazing company CR Smith (who later had a deal with Celtic alone), communications firm NTL and English brewers Carling had also sponsored both clubs.

==Events post-2012==
In 2012, Rangers suffered a financial collapse leading to the liquidation of the club. The sporting assets were acquired by a new company which allowed them to re-apply to join the Scottish football league system in the lowest division. As a result, for the first time in 120 years, no fixtures were played between Rangers and Celtic.

The status of the Old Firm was also challenged, following the logic that since Rangers &#x27;died&#x27; during the events of 2012, the rivalry also expired and any matches played since that point would be between Celtic and a &#x27;new Rangers&#x27;, albeit playing at the same stadium, in the same colours, with the same supporters and some of the same players as before. Adherents of this view often derogatorily refer to the club as &#x27;Sevco&#x27; (the original name of the post-2012 holding company), and Rangers supporters as &#x27;zombies&#x27; or &#x27;the undead&#x27;. This difference of opinion became a new factor in the rivalry.

Some Celtic supporters were particularly vociferous in their assertions, to the extent of a group paying for a full-page newspaper advertisement in January 2015 announcing that their club would soon play its first fixture against the new Rangers.

It is regarded as a continuation of the same club by the SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster; external governing bodies such as UEFA, the European Club Association and FIFA have never formally stated their position on Rangers but have issued general remarks about the continuation of a club&#x27;s history when controlled by a new company.

In 2013 numerous complaints were made to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) over official marketing communications from Rangers which stated they were &quot;Scotland&#x27;s most successful club&quot;, with this claim being disputed as the complainants declared the club had only been in existence for one year. Having considered the evidence including advice from UEFA, the ASA did not uphold the complaints.

In July 2012, a large banner was displayed at Celtic Park during a game showing a cartoon zombie representing Rangers rising from the grave before being shot by a sniper, drawing criticism due to the gunman resembling a paramilitary from the Northern Ireland conflict, although Celtic escaped formal punishment over the matter. Celtic fan groups have continued to display banners claiming Rangers are &#x27;dead&#x27;.

Celtic and their followers also became involved in other legal proceedings relating to Rangers, including the outcome of the long-running EBT investigation.

===Results on the field===
It took Rangers four years to climb through the lower divisions and re-take their place in the Scottish Premiership for the 2016–17 season; in the interim only two cup semi-finals were played between the clubs and Celtic won all four league titles by significant margins (never less than 15 points). The rivalry resumed in earnest by way of six matches during 2016–17, with Celtic eliminating Rangers from both cups at the semi-final stage on the way to lifting the trophies and emerging victorious in three of the matches in the league championship, which they also won without losing a game to secure their sixth successive title and a domestic treble. The 2017–18 season was much the same: Celtic won three of the Old Firm league fixtures plus a Scottish Cup semi-final meeting and lifted all three domestic trophies; Rangers finished third, behind Aberdeen.

Celtic won a third successive treble in 2018–19, although Rangers did finally record victories over them in the league with a 1–0 and 2–0 wins in the two fixtures at Ibrox. Rangers were runners-up in the league, their highest position since 2012. In December 2019, Rangers beat Celtic 2–1 at Celtic Park, their first away win since October 2010; that 2019–20 season was curtailed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Scotland, with Celtic declared champions having held a commanding lead when matches stopped in March 2020.

Initial signs that the 2020–21 Scottish Premiership (played almost entirely in empty stadiums due to the pandemic) would be closely fought proved inaccurate as Rangers produced consistent and defensively-strong performances, in contrast to Celtic who dropped goals and points regularly as the season progressed (although they did set a new record with a &#x27;quadruple treble&#x27;, winning twelve domestic trophies in succession). Rangers won both Old Firm fixtures and were confirmed as champions – the 55th title in their history and the first since 2011 – by early March 2021 even before the often-pivotal third fixture against Celtic was played, ending the &quot;Hoops&quot;&#x27; chances of a record-breaking tenth successive championship. A proposed (financially lucrative) first match between the clubs outside Scotland, at the Sydney Super Cup in Australia in late 2022, did not materialise when Rangers withdrew following a negative response from much of the fanbase of both clubs.

==Honours==

==All-time head-to-head record==


===Defunct minor competitions===
There are a number of matches between the two clubs that are not recognised in the official records, such as their first competitive meeting in the 1888–89 Glasgow Cup, in which Celtic defeated Rangers 6–1.


===Wartime competitions===
In World War I, the Scottish Cup was suspended. Among the unofficial competitions which were held for fundraising purposes was the Navy and Army War Fund Shield, during which Rangers defeated Celtic in December 1914.

During World War II, the Scottish Football League and Scottish Cup were suspended and in their place unofficial regional league competitions were set up (these were dominated by Rangers). One of these games was a New Year&#x27;s Day derby in 1943 which Rangers won 8–1.

==Comparative league placings==
The dominance of the clubs can be demonstrated by their relative league positions historically. The clubs have finished in the top two positions in the top division of the Scottish league 54 times, including on 22 occasions since 1996. Both sides have finished outside the top two places only five times, three of those before 1914, and both have finished outside the top three places only once, in 1965, when Rangers finished 5th and Celtic 8th. Conversely, between 1947 and 1965, on no occasion were both the top two league positions taken by the two teams, owing mostly to an extended period in the relative doldrums for Celtic, despite a title win in 1954, their only such title in a 28 year period. Celtic, however, ended that period emphatically with a run of nine successive titles, during which Rangers were runners-up on six occasions.

===Families===
Several sets of brothers have played in the Old Firm match, although not necessarily together:
*Michael Dunbar and Tom Dunbar (Celtic)
*John McPhail and Billy McPhail (Celtic)
*Frank Brogan and Jim Brogan (Celtic) 
*Derek Ferguson and Barry Ferguson (Rangers)
*Gordon Marshall and Scott Marshall (Celtic)

Those who were teammates in the fixture include:
*Willie Maley and Tom Maley (Celtic)
*John McPherson and David McPherson (Rangers) 
*Andrew McCreadie and Hugh McCreadie (Rangers)
*Jimmy McStay and Willie McStay (Celtic)
*Frank O&#x27;Donnell and Hugh O&#x27;Donnell (Celtic)
*Willie McStay and Paul McStay (Celtic, great-nephews of the earlier brothers)
*Frank de Boer and Ronald de Boer (Rangers, twins)

In the 1890s, Tom Dunbar spent a season with Rangers between two spells for Celtic, but he and his brother Mick (see above) never played against each other in the fixture. In the 1980s, the McAdam brothers played on opposite sides, and directly against one another, on several occasions: defender Tom for Celtic and forward Colin for Rangers.

Father-and-son pairs who have been selected include:
*Sandy Clark and Nicky Clark (Rangers)
*Mike Conroy Sr. and Mike Conroy Jr. (Celtic)
*John Divers Sr. and John Divers Jr. (Celtic)
*Patsy Gallacher and Willie Gallacher (Celtic)
*Jimmy McMenemy and John McMenemy (Celtic)
*Jackie McNamara Sr. and Jackie McNamara Jr. (Celtic)
*Jimmy Parlane and Derek Parlane (Rangers)
*Nicol Smith and Jimmy Smith (Rangers)

Jimmy Simpson was a Rangers captain in the 1930s, while his son Ronnie Simpson was Celtic&#x27;s European Cup-winning goalkeeper in 1967.

==Attendances==
The stadium attendance records for Rangers&#x27; Ibrox (118,567, January 1939) and Celtic&#x27;s Celtic Park (officially 83,500 but estimated at 92,000 with around 10,000 more locked out, January 1938) were both set at Old Firm matches; however while the Ibrox figure is the Rangers club record (and the record for any domestic league match in the United Kingdom), Celtic&#x27;s biggest &#x27;home&#x27; attendance was the 1969–70 European Cup semi-final with Leeds United, moved to the larger Hampden Park due to the anticipated interest: the crowd of 136,505 is a record for any match in European international club competitions.

Hampden, Scotland&#x27;s national stadium and home of Queen&#x27;s Park, is situated roughly an equal distance from Ibrox and Celtic Park in Glasgow. Due to the frequency of the two teams appearing in semi-finals and finals held there (often facing one another), its West and East stands are always allocated to the same club and are informally known as the &quot;Rangers end&quot; and &quot;Celtic end&quot; respectively. That stadium, once the largest in the world, attracted the largest Old Firm attendance of all time with 132,870 at the 1969 Scottish Cup final (it is not the record for the competition, with 147,365 having attended the 1937 final which also featured Celtic, versus Aberdeen). The record Scottish League Cup final attendance (107,609; October 1965) was an Old Firm affair, although the tournament record was set in 1947 when Rangers overcame Hibernian in a semi-final before 123,830.

The 1971 Ibrox disaster – in which 66 Rangers supporters died in a crush on an exterior stairway – occurred at the end of an Old Firm match, although the identity of the opposition was not a factor in the incident other than having drawn a large crowd of at least 75,000 to the event.

Since redevelopments completed in the 1990s, all three venues are all-seater with much smaller capacities of between 50,000 and 60,000, meaning the above records may never be beaten – the attendance of 72,069 at &#x27;old style&#x27; Hampden for the Old Firm 1989 Scottish Cup final has become a landmark figure as no match in Scotland has come close to matching it since.

===Average attendances===
When compared to other clubs in Scotland, the Old Firm maintain considerably higher attendances; Scottish football regularly posted Europe&#x27;s best figures for per-capita match attendance in the 2020s, but roughly one third of this total was Rangers supporters, one third was Celtic supporters and the other third was divided between 40 clubs. Celtic&#x27;s recorded crowds tend to be higher than Rangers as their stadium holds approximately 9,000 more seats. Both clubs (among others) have been accused of inflating their attendance figures by counting all season ticket holders in the crowd when many have not actually attended the match in question, with the accurate figures reported to the police for crowd control being lower.

The average attendances of both Old Firm clubs are regularly within the top twenty across Europe. A study of stadium attendance figures from 2013 to 2018 by the &quot;CIES Football Observatory&quot; ranked Celtic at 16th in the world during that period and Rangers at 18th, even though Rangers had been playing at lower levels for three of those five seasons. Celtic&#x27;s proportion of the distribution of spectators in Scotland was 36.5%, the highest of any club in the leagues examined, with Rangers&#x27; 27.4% placing them 8th overall for national audience share.


==Dominance of Scottish football==
The intensity of the rivalry is fuelled by the clubs&#x27; historical duopoly in Scottish football, with most meetings between them being pivotal in deciding the destiny of a championship or cup and anything but a title-winning season seen as a major disappointment, particularly as it would usually mean &#x27;the enemy&#x27; has won the trophy.

===League===

Statistics show that Rangers and Celtic have been by far the most successful clubs involved in the Scottish Football League since its formation in 1890. The pair were the only participants in every edition of the competition until 2012, when Rangers were removed from the top tier for economic reasons; they returned for the 2016–17 season. Other clubs are unable to offer even an occasional challenge over a season due to the vast disparities in fanbases and financial power, a gap which has widened since the 1990s with the majority of prize money on offer via TV deals and progress in European competitions flowing back to the Old Firm, who then re-invest and pull further ahead in a repeating cycle. In the early 2020s, despite their economic troubles over the previous decade, Rangers were able to re-establish themselves at close to the same level as Celtic and far ahead of the other clubs, who can only realistically aim to finish in the higher league positions to qualify for European competitions or win a knockout cup – which would usually involve beating at least one of the Glasgow giants. It has long been argued that this situation with its largely predictable and repetitive nature diminishes Scottish football as a commercial product and hampers the quality of players produced for the clubs and ultimately the Scotland national football team.

Of the 127 championships played, 109 (85.8%) have been won by one of the Old Firm with Rangers slightly ahead on 55 titles to Celtic&#x27;s 54, and 19 between ten other clubs (including a shared title between Rangers and Dumbarton). Although there have been brief periods when silverware went elsewhere, there have also been long spells of domination by each Old Firm club; the Nine in a row championship record was first set by Celtic between 1966 and 1974, equalled by Rangers between 1989 and 1997, and again by Celtic between 2012 and 2020.

On just five occasions since 1891 have neither of the Glasgow giants been the league winner nor the runner-up. This includes 1964–65, the only season in which both Rangers and Celtic failed to finish in the top three places. The Old Firm have finished 1st and 2nd 53 times overall. Between the resurgence of Celtic in the mid-1990s and the liquidation of Rangers in 2012, &#x27;1–2&#x27; finishes were recorded in all but one of 17 &quot;SPL-era&quot; seasons, the exception being Hearts in 2005–06.

The longest sequence without an Old Firm title is three years between 1983 and 1985, while the longest unbroken run of championships between the two clubs began immediately afterwards and is ongoing: 38 seasons and counting since 1986 (overtaking a previous sequence of 27 years between 1905 and 1931).

&quot;As of end of the 2023–24 season. Runners-up in (parentheses)&quot;

===Scottish Cup===

Although the initial Scottish Cup was played in 1874, 15 years before Celtic were formed, they have still won the competition more than any other club – 42 times, plus 18 runners-up – with Rangers on 34 (19 runners-up). Next in the winners list (other than Queen&#x27;s Park whose wins were confined to the 19th century) are Hearts with 8 wins spread across 120 years. There have been 15 Old Firm finals, although never two in consecutive years, while there have been just 40 finals involving neither Rangers or Celtic, 17 of which were in the 19th century. After the 1928 final, there was no Old Firm meeting again for 28 editions until 1963, although an additional seven years had elapsed due to World War II when the cup was not contested.

The longest run of Old Firm wins is 11, between 1971 and 1981, while the longest sequence of other winners since Celtic&#x27;s formation is 5, between 1955 and 1959. The longest run of Old Firm wins is 11 between 1971 and 1981.

Rangers&#x27; sudden removal from the upper echelons of the Scottish game in 2012 led to a more diverse list of finalists in both cups; the expected Celtic monopoly of all competitions did not occur in the knockout formats and there were several maiden trophy wins for clubs such as St Johnstone, Inverness CT and Ross County. However, after Hibernian broke a 114-year &#x27;curse&#x27; in 2016, Celtic won the next four editions in succession, the longest winning sequence in the competition&#x27;s long history.

* Rangers wins: 1893–94, 1927–28, 1962–63, 1965–66, 1972–73, 1998–99, 2001–02

* Cup withheld: 1908–09

===League Cup===

The Scottish League Cup has been contested 79 times since 1946–47. Rangers have been the most successful team in the competition with 28 wins in 38 finals, with Celtic second with 22 wins in 37 finals. 14 other clubs share 29 wins between them. 17 of its finals have been Old Firm occasions, while 21 featured neither of them.

The longest run of Old Firm wins is 8 between 1964 and 1971, while the longest run of other winners is 7 between 1950 and 1956.

====Old Firm League Cup finals====
* Rangers wins: 1964–65, 1970–71, 1975–76, 1977–78, 1983–84, 1986–87, 1990–91, 2002–03, 2010–11
* Celtic wins: 1957–58, 1965–66, 1966–67, 1982–83, 2008–09, 2019–20, 2022–23, 2024–25

==Women&#x27;s football==
The Rangers–Celtic rivalry in women&#x27;s football has existed only in the 21st century, with Rangers W.F.C. having formed in 2008, one year after the Celtic F.C. Women. Fixtures between the teams generate additional media interest due to their association with the parent clubs, and are referred to as &quot;Old Firm&quot; matches as a result. On 13 April 2016, Celtic women&#x27;s team played their first competitive match at Celtic Park, marking the occasion with a 5–1 victory over Rangers. During the 2019 season, sisters Kodie and Brogan Hay played on opposite sides in the fixture.

The dynamic of women&#x27;s football in Scotland differs to the men&#x27;s, with a third team in the city – Glasgow City F.C. – dominating the semi-professional Scottish Women&#x27;s Premier League, winning 14 consecutive titles between 2008 and 2021. In that period Rangers only finished above Celtic once (2014), while Celtic lifted a single trophy, the SWPL Cup in 2010. In 2019, both Celtic and Rangers stated they would be increasing their investment in women&#x27;s football and offering professional contracts to players. It was Rangers who made the breakthrough and won the SWPL title in 2021–22, whilst Celtic defeated Glasgow City to claim both the Scottish Women&#x27;s Cup and SWPL Cup. The following season began with Rangers claiming their first SWPL Cup and ended with crowds of over 10,000 at both Celtic Park and Ibrox watching the final league fixtures – in which Glasgow City fended off their increasingly well-funded rivals and regained the championship in dramatic circumstances – quickly followed by another healthy attendance at Hampden in the first Old Firm cup final in the women&#x27;s game (as well as the first to be held at the national stadium), with Celtic retaining the trophy.

<doc id="239469" wikidata="Q2551797" url="?curid=239469" title="Siege of Yorktown (1862)">
<text>The Battle of Yorktown or siege of Yorktown was fought from April 5 to May 4, 1862, as part of the Peninsula Campaign of the American Civil War. Marching from Fort Monroe, Union Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan&#x27;s Army of the Potomac encountered Maj. Gen. John B. Magruder&#x27;s small Confederate force at Yorktown behind the Warwick Line. McClellan suspended his march up the Peninsula toward Richmond and settled in for siege operations.

On April 5, the IV Corps of Brig. Gen. Erasmus D. Keyes made initial contact with Confederate defensive works at Lee&#x27;s Mill, an area McClellan expected to move through without resistance. Magruder&#x27;s ostentatious movement of troops back and forth convinced the Union that his works were strongly held. As the two armies fought an artillery duel, reconnaissance indicated to Keyes the strength and breadth of the Confederate fortifications, and he advised McClellan against assaulting them. McClellan ordered the construction of siege fortifications and brought his heavy siege guns to the front. In the meantime, Gen. Joseph E. Johnston brought reinforcements for Magruder.

On April 16, Union forces probed a point in the Confederate line at Dam No. 1. The Union failed to exploit the initial success of this attack, however. This lost opportunity held up McClellan for two additional weeks while he tried to convince the U.S. Navy to bypass the Confederates&#x27; big guns at Yorktown and Gloucester Point, ascend the York River to West Point and outflank the Warwick Line. McClellan planned a massive bombardment for dawn on May 5, but the Confederate army slipped away during the night of May 3 toward Williamsburg.

The battle took place near the site of the 1781 siege of Yorktown.

==Background==
McClellan had chosen to approach the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia, with an amphibious operation that landed troops on the tip of the Virginia Peninsula at Fort Monroe. His Army of the Potomac numbered 121,500 men, transported starting on March 17 by 389 vessels. McClellan planned to use U.S. Navy forces to envelop Yorktown, but the emergence of the Confederate ironclad CSS &quot;Virginia&quot; and the Battle of Hampton Roads (March 8–9, 1862) disrupted this plan. The threat of the &quot;Virginia&quot; on the James River and the heavy Confederate batteries at the mouth of the York River prevented the Navy from assuring McClellan that they could control either the York or the James, so he settled on a purely land approach toward Yorktown.

The Confederate defenders of Yorktown, led by Maj. Gen. John B. Magruder, initially numbered only 11–13,000 men; the rest of the Confederate forces, under the overall command of General Joseph E. Johnston, remained spread out across eastern Virginia at Culpeper, Fredericksburg, and Norfolk. Magruder constructed a defensive line from Yorktown on the York River, behind the Warwick River, to Mulberry Point on the James River (even taking advantage of some trenches originally dug by Cornwallis in 1781) to effectively block the full width of the Peninsula, although he could adequately man none of the defensive works at that time. This became known as the Warwick Line.

McClellan&#x27;s plan called for Maj. Gen. Samuel P. Heintzelman&#x27;s III Corps to fix the Confederate troops in their trenches near the York River, while the IV Corps under Brig. Gen. Erasmus D. Keyes enveloped the Confederate right and cut off their lines of communication. McClellan and his staff, ignorant of the extent of Magruder&#x27;s line, assumed the Confederates had concentrated only in the immediate vicinity of Yorktown.

==Battle==

===Union advance and Lee&#x27;s Mill===
On April 4, 1862, the Union Army pushed through Magruder&#x27;s initial line of defense but the following day encountered his more effective Warwick Line. The nature of the terrain made it difficult to determine the exact disposition of the Confederate forces. McClellan estimated that the Confederates had 15 to 18,000 troops in the defensive line. Accounts by Magruder&#x27;s soldiers indicate he marched his troops back and forth throughout his lines as a ruse to make his forces look stronger. &quot;This morning we were called out by the &#x27;Long roll&#x27; and have been traveling most of the day, seeming with no other view than to show ourselves to the enemy at as many different points of the line as possible,&quot; a Louisiana soldier recorded in his diary. Magruder&#x27;s own reports, however, do not mention this. Word of Magruder&#x27;s deception reached Richmond nevertheless, with Mary Chestnut noting in her diary, &quot;It was a wonderful thing how he played his ten thousand before McClellan like fireflies and utterly deluded him...&quot; On 6–7 April, McClellan estimated (given Magruder&#x27;s reinforcements) that 30,000 troops were at Yorktown. Troops continued to arrive and on 20 April McClellan estimated &quot;more than 80,000&quot; were at Yorktown.

McClellan had five divisions available and advanced in two columns. The 4th Corps of two divisions under Keyes advanced towards Lee&#x27;s Mill, whilst the 3rd Corps of two divisions under Heintzelman advanced towards Yorktown proper. He kept his last division (Sedgwick) in reserve to commit to either column. The lead division of Keyes&#x27; corps under Brigadier General W.F. Smith contacted the position at Lee&#x27;s Mill in the early afternoon of the 5th. Smith had two brigades (Davidson and Hancock) and a battery (Wheeler&#x27;s) to hand and attempted to suppress the superior enemy artillery. He lost the firefight and despite an order from McClellan to Keyes &quot;to attack with all his force if only with the bayonet&quot;, Smith withdrew back to Warwick Court House. The 3rd Corps advanced directly towards Yorktown, but were stopped by heavy artillery fire.

That evening McClellan ordered two brigades to march across the entire frontage of the enemy line. The next day (April 6) Hancock and Burns took parts of their brigades and marched across the entire frontage to provoke enemy fire. Hancock took the 6th Maine Infantry and 5th Wisconsin Infantry left to right, and Burns went right to left. This proved that there was no break in the river that could easily be assaulted. That evening a major storm started, and shut down all troop movements until the 10th. Further s were ordered in order to find a weak point to attack, and on April 9 Hancock performed a reconnaissance around Dam Number One, where Magruder had widened the Warwick to create a water obstacle nearby. The rebel picket line was along the Garrow Ridge on the eastern side of the river. Hancock drove off the Confederate pickets and took some prisoners. Smith and the attached engineer (Comstock) noted this was the only place along the river where the ground was higher on the eastern bank than the western, and hence was vulnerable. McClellan chided Smith for not taking an opportunity to attack stating &quot;If you had gone and succeeded, you would have been a Major General&quot;. Hancock considered this area a weak spot in the line, but his messenger was captured by the rebels en route to Smith&#x27;s HQ. Keyes believed that the Warwick Line fortifications could not be carried by assault and so informed McClellan.

During this phase, Union Army Balloon Corps aeronaut Professor Thaddeus S. C. Lowe used two balloons, the &quot;Constitution&quot; and the &quot;Intrepid&quot;, to perform aerial observation. On April 11, &quot;Intrepid&quot; carried Brig. Gen. Fitz John Porter, a division commander of the V Corps, was aloft, but unexpected winds sent the balloon over enemy lines, causing great consternation in the Union command before other winds returned him to safety. Confederate Captain John Bryan suffered a similar wind mishap in a hot air balloon over the Yorktown lines.

===Dam Number One===

It was to the amazement of the Confederates - who had estimated the Union&#x27;s strength at 200,000, four times the real number - and the dismay of President Abraham Lincoln that McClellan did not attack immediately. McClellan wished to either turn the position with an amphibious movement or find a weak point where an assault stood a reasonable chance of success. The Navy refused to cooperate, but on 14 April, McClellan&#x27;s chief engineer John G. Barnard finally reported that a weak point had been found at Dam No. 1, located on the Warwick River. McClellan developed a plan of attack at that point. Initially a division (Smith&#x27;s) would seize and occupy Garrow Ridge overlooking the dams. This would prevent the rebels from conducting further work on a fort they were building at the river&#x27;s edge and prevent rebel scouts from finding the assembling assault forces. He would then assemble a large force behind the ridge and assault the rebel fortifications. On April 15 orders were sent to Smith to occupy the Garrow Ridge and probe the rebel fortifications to see whether there was a clearing in the woods behind the crossing. All the uncommitted units (Casey&#x27;s Division, Richardson&#x27;s Division and [Henry] Naglee&#x27;s brigade) were ordered to assemble ready to assault in the following days.

Smith&#x27;s operations, which took place on April 16, were a debacle. Initially wildly successful in seizing the Garrow Ridge and advancing a small force to drive off the rebels, McClellan considered the task completed, and returned to his HQ to arrange for the assaulting units to move into position. Smith then decided to advance a small force of Vermonters across the Dam against his orders. They were rapidly pinned down as Brig. Gen. Howell Cobb&#x27;s brigade, supported by two others, came down on this small force, and were driven back. In the process they collapsed the dam, and destroyed the crossing point. This rendered the planned assault impossible. Smith faced a severe criticism for his failure, and was the subject of a witchhunt by a Vermont senator.

Drummer Julian Scott, along with First Sergeant Edward Holton and Captain Samuel E. Pingree were awarded the Medal of Honor for their heroisim at Dam Number One.

==Aftermath of Dam No. 1==

On the morning of April 17 it became obvious that no assault could be attempted at any point. At this point McClellan acquiesced to conducting &quot;regular approaches&quot; and ordered parallels to be dug for heavy artillery. The siege preparations at Yorktown consisted of 15 batteries with more than 70 heavy guns, including two 200-pounder Parrotts and twelve 100-pounder Parrots, with the rest of the rifled pieces divided between 20-pounder and 30-pounder Parrotts and Rodman siege rifles. These were augmented by 41 mortars, ranging in size from to seacoast mortars, which weighed over 10 tons and fired shells weighing 220 pounds. When fired in unison, these batteries would deliver over 7,000 pounds of ordnance onto the enemy positions with each volley.

McClellan had not given up hope of turning Yorktown. The commander of the York River flotilla, Missroon, had consistently refused to even approach the Yorktown batteries, citing the weakness of his ship. However, on 16 April the USS &quot;Sebago&quot; joined the flotilla, and her captain promptly reported Missroon&#x27;s &quot;cowardice&quot;. Missroon attempted to delay further by stating he&#x27;d only attack Yorktown if the opposite fortress at Gloucester Point was destroyed first. McClellan gave him the newly arrived division of Franklin as a landing force, but Missroon kept finding reasons not to land them. Finally on 30 April Missroon was relieved and replaced by Commander William Smith. Smith promptly closed with the Yorktown batteries and bombarded them. This would precipitate Johnston&#x27;s retreat.

For the remainder of April, the Confederates, now at ca. 72,000 effectives and under the direct command of Johnston, improved their defenses while McClellan undertook the laborious process of transporting and placing massive siege artillery batteries, which he planned to deploy on May 5. This would be followed by an assault by six divisions against &quot;The Divide&quot;, a fortified line containing two forts (named the Red Redoubt and the White Redoubt) linked by continual trenchline between the head of the Warwick and the main fortress of Yorktown.

To Johnston, the naval bombardment of 30 April, and the initial Federal bombardment by the siege guns on 1 May were a signal that time was up. Johnston sent his supply train (which was small, because Yorktown was being supplied by water) in the direction of Richmond on May 3. That evening the rebels expended as much ordnance as possible to discourage pursuit, and when the last rebel infantry was clear, leaving booby traps and land mines in their works, the gunners set long fuses on the remaining powder and joined the retreat.

Sometime after midnight on 4 May, two escaped slaves approached Hancock&#x27;s brigade. They said the rebels were withdrawing. Hancock sent the message to Smith, who was awoken at 2 a.m. with this information, which was followed immediately by Lt. George Custer reporting he&#x27;d seen the same from a balloon. Still groggy, Smith sent the messenger up to Keyes, and ordered the pickets to investigate at dawn. Custer was not satisfied with this and rode forward to Brookes&#x27;s Vermont Brigade and told him. He immediately woke his brigade and set them in place to make a dawn attack, and at 5:30 a.m. the Vermonters seized the fortifications they&#x27;d been repelled by on 16 April. Keyes&#x27;s message apparently did not arrive until well into the morning.

Meanwhile, sometime between 3:15 and 4:00 a.m., General Jameson, the General of the Trenches for the day, was informed that there were explosions in Yorktown and picket firing. He woke General Porter, the Director of the Siege, with the information. Porter looked through at Yorktown and dismissed the rumour that the rebels were retreating. However at 4:30 a.m. three rebel soldiers surrendered to the Federals and were brought to Jameson. He went back to Porter who this time accepted the information, ordering that reconissances be immediately sent out and for several regiments to occupy Yorktown at dawn.

At 5:30 a.m. the news reached McClellan&#x27;s HQ. Awoken by the news he then telegraphed Sumner, Smith and Porter to push forward and ascertain the truth of the matter. Other news soon came in, and McClellan ordered a general pursuit. He sent cavalry under Brig. Gen. George Stoneman in pursuit and ordered Brig. Gen. William B. Franklin&#x27;s division to reboard Navy transports, sail up the York River, and cut off Johnson&#x27;s retreat. The stage was set for the subsequent Battle of Williamsburg and Battle of Eltham&#x27;s Landing.

<doc id="239470" wikidata="Q658792" url="?curid=239470" title="GE multifactorial analysis">
<text>GE multifactorial analysis is a technique used in brand marketing and product management to help a company decide what products to add to its portfolio and which opportunities in the market they should continue to invest in. It is conceptually similar to BCG analysis, but more complex with nine cells rather than four. Like in BCG analysis, a two-dimensional portfolio matrix is created. However, with the GE model the dimensions are multi factorial. One dimension comprises nine industry attractiveness measures; the other comprises twelve internal business strength measures. The GE matrix helps a strategic business unit evaluate its overall strength.

Each product, brand, service, or potential product is mapped in this industry attractiveness/business strength space. The GE multi-factor model or &quot;nine-box matrix&quot; was first developed by McKinsey for General Electric in the early 1970s.

==Aims of the GE model==
This model aims to evaluate the existing portfolios of strategic business units and to develop strategies to achieve growth by addition of new products and businesses to this portfolio and further, to analyze which business units to invest in and which ones to sell off.

==Construction of the GE matrix==
The GE matrix is constructed in a 3x3 grid with market attractiveness plotted on the Y-axis and business strength on the X-axis, both being measured on a high, medium, or low score. Five steps are considered in order to formulate the matrix;
* The range of products produced by the SBU (Strategic Business Unit) must be listed
* Factors which make the particular market attractive must be identified
* Evaluating where the SBU stands in this market
* Processes through which calculations about business strength and market attractiveness can be made
* Determining which category an SBU lies in: high, medium, or low.

===Market attractiveness===
The attractiveness of a market is demonstrated by how beneficial it is for a company to enter and compete within this market. It is based on various factors; the size of the market and the rate at which it is growing, the possibility of profit, the number of competitors within the industry and their weaknesses.

===Business/competitive strength===
This helps decide whether a company is competent enough to compete in the given markets. It can be determined by factors within the company itself such as its assets and holdings, the share it holds in the market and the development of this share, the position in the market of its brand and the loyalty of customers to this brand, its creativeness in coming up with new and improved products and in dealing with the fluctuating situations of the market, as well as keeping in mind environmental/government concerns such as energy consumption, waste disposal etc.

===Measuring market attractiveness and business strength===
Once the factors that determine the two are identified and rated, each factor is then given a certain magnitude and a calculation is made as follows;
factor 1 rating x factor 1 magnitude + factor 2 rating x factor 2 magnitude + ... factor n rating x factor n magnitude.

===Plotting===
SBU&#x27;s in the matrix can be represented as a circle; the radius exhibits the size of the market, the SBU&#x27;s holdings in the market are equated through a pie chart within the circle and an arrow outside the circle shows the standing of the SBU expected in the future. In the image attached for example, an SBU holds 45% of the market&#x27;s shares. The arrow is outwards thus showing that the SBU is expected to grow and gain strength and then its tip indicates the future position of the SBU.

==Investment strategies==
When considering investment, it must first be seen which box of the matrix an SBU falls in; grow, selectivity, or harvest.

===Grow===
SBUs that are classified into this category attract various company&#x27;s investment as they are expected to yield high returns in the future. These investments should be split into categories such as research and development, acquisition of other SBU&#x27;s, extensive advertisements and expanding production capacity.

===Selectivity===
SBUs that hold a lot of ambiguity fall into this category. They are usually only invested in if there is any prospect of competencies in managerial and corporate capabilities and if companies have any money left after investments in &#x27;grow&#x27; business units.

===Harvest===
SBUs performing poorly in unattractive industries are classified into this category. Companies only invest in them if they generate enough cash to equal the investment amount, otherwise, they may be liquidated.

==Advantages==
*Raises awareness between managers about the performance of their products in the market and aids in developing strategies to get maximum returns from the resources available.
*Helps extract information about a business unit&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses and to devise strategies to accelerate and improve performance.
*Aids the business in growing and in providing information about potential market opportunities.
*It is more complex in comparison to the BCG matrix.

==Limitations==
*There is no set rule to &#x27;weight&#x27; factors and this process may be subjective across different business unit&#x27;s. For example, the weight given to a factor by one business may be different to the weight/importance given to it by another.
*The formulation of a GE matrix is very expensive and time-consuming.
*Investment strategies are often not implemented in an accurate and proper manner.
*The dynamics among SBUs themselves are not taken into account.

==Comparison with the BCG matrix==
When compared to the BCG matrix consisting of four cells, the GE matrix is more complex with its nine cells. This means it not only takes longer to construct, but also to implement. The BCG matrix is much simpler and the factors needed to construct it are accessed more easily and quickly. It takes into account a wide range of factors when determining market attractiveness and business strengths, which is replaced by market share and market growth in the BCG matrix. Also, where factors are classified in the GE matrix as high, medium and low, those in the BCG matrix are divided between high and low. Moreover, the G.E matrix overcomes many of the limitations and constraints of the BCG matrix.

<doc id="239475" wikidata="Q211591" url="?curid=239475" title="Morocco in the Eurovision Song Contest">
<text>Morocco participated in the Eurovision Song Contest for its first and only time at the . Its selected song &quot;&quot;, sung in Arabic and performed by Samira Bensaïd, placed second to last. The country has not returned to the contest since.

==Background==
The Eurovision Song Contest is an annual international song competition held since 1956 by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) between its members who participate representing their countries. Each participating broadcaster submits an original song to be performed on live television and radio, then casts votes for the other countries&#x27; songs to determine the winner. Since its inception, entry to the contest has been open to all members of the EBU, a group also containing broadcasters from countries in North Africa and the Middle East.

The Moroccan public broadcaster (SNRT) is a full member of the EBU, thus eligible to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest representing Morocco, but have declined to participate in the contest due to &#x27;s presence. However, SNRT&#x27;s predecessor, (RTM), who had previously broadcast select contests in the 1960s and 1970s, participated in the when Israel was absent. This was the first, and as of 2025 the only time, that Morocco has participated in Eurovision.

Before Morocco&#x27;s 1980 participation, Tunisia (at the ) was the only African country that had intended to compete, with it even being drawn to perform fourth, however, it eventually withdrew from the contest.

==1980 participation==

RTM selected the song &quot;, performed by Moroccan singer Samira Bensaïd as the first entrant from Morocco in the contest. It is a moderately up-tempo number, with clear influences from Western disco and Arabic overtones. Bensaïd sings of the need for peace among the world&#x27;s nations, taking the role of &quot;the children of the world&quot; to describe a vision of a society free of war and hate. It was interpreted as a message of peace addressed to Israel and the Arab countries.

On 19 April 1980, the Eurovision Song Contest was held at the in The Hague hosted by (NOS). Bensaïd performed &quot;Bitakat Hob&quot; fifth on the night. Jean Claudric conducted the event&#x27;s orchestra for the entry. At the close of voting, it had received 7 points, all of them from , placing 18th in a field of nineteen, and ahead of perennial last-place recipient .

The country&#x27;s second-to-last place was a disappointment for RTM, which decided never to participate in the contest again. Bensaïd&#x27;s career did not suffer, however, as she went on to become one of the leading Arab recording artists of the 20th century. She recorded a French version of the song &quot;Les enfants de l&#x27;amitié&quot;, found on the B-side of the single and in 1980, Filippos Nikolaou released a Greek cover version &quot;Tosi kardia, tosi agapi&quot; (). 

&quot;&quot; was the first Eurovision song to include Arabic lyrics, and remains the only one sung entirely in Arabic.



==Future==
A second Moroccan broadcaster, 2M TV, has expressed their intention to join the EBU. Should its application be successful, it would be eligible to participate in the contest representing Morocco. In May 2018, Israeli Minister of Communications Ayoob Kara announced his intention to invite countries of the Arab world to participate in the contest in Tel Aviv, but Morocco was not on the list of participating countries released on 7 November 2018.

Following the signing of the normalization agreement between Israel and Morocco on 10 December 2020, Eran Sikurel, a politician and radio host working at the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation (IPBC/Kan), called on Moroccan broadcaster SNRT to return to the contest on his Twitter account, but no response was received.

<doc id="239481" wikidata="Q369894" url="?curid=239481" title="Aide-de-camp">
<text>An aide-de-camp (, ; French expression meaning literally &quot;helper in the military camp&quot;) is a personal assistant or secretary to a person of high rank, usually a senior military, police or government officer, or to a member of a royal family or a head of state.

An aide-de-camp may participate at ceremonial functions, and the first aide-de-camp is typically the foremost personal aide. This is not to be confused with an adjutant, who is the senior administrator of a military unit.

The badge of office for an aide-de-camp is usually the aiguillette, a braided cord in gold or other colours, worn on the shoulder of a uniform. Whether it is worn on the left or the right shoulder is dictated by protocol.

In some countries, aide-de-camp is considered to be a title of honour, which confers the post-nominal letters ADC, A.D.C. or A de C.

==Argentina==

In Argentina, three officers, one from each armed service, of the rank of lieutenant colonel or its equivalent, are appointed as aide-de-camp to the president of the republic and three others to the minister of defence, these six being the only ones to be called , which is one Spanish translation for aide-de-camp ( is a phonetic rendition of the French term; or is a calque).

A controversy was raised in 2006, when president Néstor Kirchner promoted his army aide-de-camp, Lieutenant Colonel Graham, to colonel, one year ahead of his class. Upon becoming president, Cristina Kirchner decided to have, for the first time, female officers as her aides-de-camp.

In each of the armed forces, the chief of staff and other senior officers have their own adjutants, normally of the rank of major or lieutenant colonel, or its equivalent. At unit level, the unit S1 (personnel officer) doubles as the unit commander&#x27;s adjutant, although in recent times in many units this practice has been left only for ceremonial purposes, while for everyday duties a senior non-commissioned officer performs the adjutant&#x27;s activities.

An aiguillette is worn on the right shoulder by aides-de-camp and adjutants as a symbol of their position, the colour of the aiguillette depending on the rank of the person they are serving (there are golden, tan, silver and red aiguillettes, as well as an olive-green one for combat uniform).

==Belgium==
In Belgium, the Head of the King&#x27;s Military Household is a two, three or four-star General who helps the King exercise the powers vested in him by the constitution in the field of defence. He monitors the international security situation and informs the King accordingly. He keeps the King posted of the situation, means and resources, functioning and missions of the Belgian Armed Forces, in close cooperation with the King&#x27;s Cabinet. The Head of the Military Household also oversees the coordination with the security detail of the Royal Palace and runs the Information Technology Service.

The Aides de Camp to the King are general or senior officers assigned by the King to accompany important visitors or to represent him on occasions when he cannot be present himself.

The Equerries to the King are at the King&#x27;s constant disposal on a rotational basis; they accompany him on his travels and assist him in performing his daily tasks.

The title of honorary aide-de-camp to the king can be granted by the royal court for services rendered. Notable people include Major General Baron Édouard Empain, Count Charles John d&#x27;Oultremont, and Lieutenant General Baron Albert du Roy de Blicquy.

==Commonwealth of Nations countries==

In Commonwealth of Nations countries, aides-de-camp are mostly appointed from military or auxiliary services. They are entitled to use the letters ADC or A de C after their names. The emblem of the office is the aiguillette worn on their uniform.

===Australia===

In Australia, Australian Defence Force officers serve as aides-de-camp to specific senior appointments, such as the monarch, governor-general, state governors, chief of the Defence Force, and other specified Army, Navy and Air Force command appointments. Honorary aides-de-camp to the governor-general or state governors are entitled to the post-nominal ADC during their appointment. 

Officers of and above the ranks of rear admiral, major general, and air vice-marshal in specifically designated command appointments are entitled to an aide-de-camp with the army rank of captain (or equivalent). Within the navy, an aide-de-camp is called a &quot;flag lieutenant&quot; and senior naval officers are called &quot;flag officers&quot;.

=== Bermuda ===

In 1973, Sir Richard Sharples, then governor of Bermuda, and his aide-de-camp, Captain Hugh Sayers, were murdered on the grounds of Government House.

===Canada===
Aides-de-camp in Canada are appointed to the monarch and some members of the royal family, the governor general, lieutenant governors, and to certain other appointments (e.g., Minister of National Defence, flag and general officers, Canadian heads of mission, foreign heads of state visiting Canada).

In addition to the military officers appointed as full-time aides-de-camp to the governor general, several other flag, general, and senior officers are appointed &quot;ex officio&quot; as honorary aides-de-camp to the governor general or members of the royal family including:
* Chief of the Defence Staff
* Commandant of the Royal Military College of Canada
* A senior officer of the Quebec-based Royal 22e Régiment
* Commanding officer, the Governor General&#x27;s Horse Guards
* Commanding officer, Governor General&#x27;s Foot Guards
* Commanding officer, the Canadian Grenadier Guards
* Commanding officer, the Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada
* Commanding officers of Naval Reserve divisions

Most aides-de-camp wear a gold-pattern aiguillette when acting in their official capacity; however, members of St. John Ambulance Canada wear silver aiguillettes consistent with their other accoutrements as aides-de-camp or as a symbol of ceremonial representation such as a member of the honour guard or a position of command on parade. All aides-de-camp also wear the cypher or badge of the principal to whom they are appointed. Honorary appointees to the monarch, such as the royal cypher or the Prince of Wales, wear the appropriate cypher on their uniform epaulette and are entitled to use the post-nominal letters ADC for the duration of their appointment.

Aides-de-camp to the governor general wear the governor general&#x27;s badge, known as the crest of the arms of Canada, and aides-de-camp to a lieutenant governor wear the lieutenant governor&#x27;s badge (the shield of the province surmounted by a crown). They are appointed from officers of the Canadian Forces. Aides-de-camp to lieutenant governors are appointed from officers of the Canadian Forces, Royal Canadian Mounted Police and, depending on the province, aides may also be appointed from other uniformed organizations such as municipal or provincial police and emergency services. In certain instances, civilians may be appointed. Non-uniformed civilians do not wear the aiguillette, but do wear their lieutenant governor&#x27;s badge as a symbol of their appointment. On 29 November 1973, Governor General Roland Michener concluded his initiative to permit aides-de-camp to the governor general and lieutenant governors to use the post-nominal letters A de C for the duration of their appointment.

Aides-de-camp to royal and vice-regal personages wear the aiguillette on the right shoulder. Aides-de-camp to all others wear their aiguillette on the left shoulder.

===India===

In India, officers of the rank of major general and equivalent and above in the sister services who are in command of divisions or of peacetime commands have aides-de-camp who usually belong to their general&#x27;s parent regiment/battalion. There have been instances where the sons have served a tenure of aide-de-camp to their fathers. In India, aide-de-camp is a title of honour, and current as well as former aides-de-camp are conferred the post-nominal letters ADC.

The service chiefs, including the chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Staff, usually have three aides-de-camp and the president of India has five aides-de-camp (three from the Army and one each from the Navy and the Air Force). There is also one honorary aide-de-camp from the Territorial Army. The president may at his or her pleasure appoint any distinguished officer from the armed forces including the service chiefs as honorary aide-de-camp. The governors of the states have two aides-de-camp, one each from the Indian Armed Forces and the Indian and state police services except for the state of Jammu and Kashmir, where both the aides-de-camp to the governor are appointed from the Indian Army.

===Malaysia===
An aide-de-camp or &quot;adikung&quot; as it known locally in Malaysia is appointed by the federal government or the state government from officers of the Royal Malaysian Police or from the Malaysian Armed Forces officers comprising the Malaysian Army, Royal Malaysian Air Force or from Royal Malaysian Navy. There were also non-military or police officers who were appointed as aide-de-camp.

===New Zealand===
As in other Commonwealth countries where the monarch is head of state, personnel from the New Zealand Defence Force serve as aides-de-camp to royal and vice-regal personages. The governor-general of New Zealand has two full-time aides-de-camp of the rank of army captain, lieutenant RNZN or RNZAF flight lieutenant. Additional and honorary aides-de-camp to the governor-general are of the rank of lieutenant colonel or equivalent. Aiguillettes are of the standard palace  1 type and worn on the right shoulder. Equivalent appointments also serve the minister of Defence, the chief of Defence Force and service chiefs. These are usually known as military assistants (MA) personal staff officers (PSOs) or, in the case of the RNZN, flag lieutenant (flags), and wear service-specific  2 aiguillettes with coloured flecks (dark blue for navy, red for army and light blue for air force) on the left shoulder.

===Pakistan===
In Pakistan, the president, prime minister, and governors have their own aides-de-camp. The aide-de-camp can be from any one of the three Armed Forces and typically are of the rank of captain (army), lieutenant (navy) or flight lieutenant (air force). The aide-de-camp to Justice Khan Habibullah Khan, while he was chief minister and leader of the house of West Pakistan, was his son, a senior bureaucrat, Captain Akhtar Munir Marwat and Captain Gohar Ayub Khan was to his father, President Field Marshal Ayub Khan. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee and all the three service chiefs are authorised to have an aide-de-camp. In Pakistan, officers of the rank of major general and equivalent and above in the sister services who are in command of divisions or of peacetime commands have aides-de-camp who usually belong to their general&#x27;s parent regiment/battalion.

===Papua New Guinea===
As in other commonwealth realms where the monarch is head of state, the governor-general of Papua New Guinea has two full-time aides-de-camp. One is from the Papua New Guinea Defence Force and one from the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary of the ranks of PNGDF captain and RPNGC superintendent.

===Singapore===
In Singapore, the president appoints aides-de-camp from the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), the Singapore Police Force (SPF) and the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF). Selected SAF officers typically hold the rank of major or military expert 5, selected SCDF officers hold the rank of major, and selected SPF officers typically hold the rank of assistant superintendent of police. Both male and female officers may serve as aides-de-camp.

Their duties include assisting in liaison for important guests on behalf of the president and taking care of visiting foreign dignitaries.

===Sri Lanka===
In Sri Lanka, the president has an aide-de-camp and an extra aide-de-camp from the three armed services. All general, flag and air officers are entitled to an aide-de-camp, usually selected from their parent regiment or unit. In the navy, an aide-de-camp is called a flag lieutenant. Junior officers (of the rank of major and below) of the armed services who have completed three years of service can be appointed for (extra-regimental) special appointments as an aide-de-camp or extra aide-de-camp for a maximum of three years. Following such appointment, reappointment is not possible for two years. Medical officers of the rank of lieutenant colonel and above can be appointed as honorary physician to the president or honorary surgeon to the president.

The tradition dates back to the office of governor of Ceylon. The governor&#x27;s staff included an aide-de-camp as a permanent appointment drawing pay from the civil list, usually held by a retired junior officer from a British Army regiment. In addition the governor&#x27;s staff included the head mudaliyar who served as the native aide-de-camp to the governor on a permanent and honorary (non-paid) basis; as well as several extra aide-de-camp appointed from regiments of the Ceylon Defense Force and later from the Ceylon Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. With the formation of the office of the Governor-General of Ceylon the practice continued with Ceylon Army officers replacing the British Army officers. At present an officer of the rank of brigadier serves as aide-de-camp to the president, while an officer of the rank of colonel or equivalent serves as aide-de-camp to the defence secretary. 

In 1992, two Sri Lankan ADCs were killed in active service, and in 2006 an ADC was severely wounded:
* On 8 August 1992, Major General Denzil Kobbekaduwa (Overall Operations Commander - Northern Sector) and his aide-de-camp Major Nalin S. De Alwis, were killed along with several senior army and navy officers when their Land Rover hit a land mine off Araly Point in Kayts.
* On 16 November 1992, the Commander of the Sri Lanka Navy, Vice Admiral Clancy Fernando and his flag lieutenant, Lieutenant Sandun Gunasekera, were assassinated by a LTTE suicide bomber who drove an explosives laden motorbike into the admiral&#x27;s staff car in front of the Galle Face Green.
* In 2006, the Commander of the Sri Lanka Army, Lieutenant General Sarath Fonseka, and his aide-de-camp Major Priyal Wickramasinghe were severely wounded in a LTTE suicide bomb attack by a pregnant LTTE operative on the general&#x27;s staff car inside Army Headquarters.

===Tanzania===

The president of Tanzania has an aide-de-camp from the Tanzania People&#x27;s Defence Force, with the rank of &quot;kanali&quot;, which is equivalent to that of a colonel.

===United Kingdom===
====Historic usage====

In the United Kingdom, an aide-de-camp (ADC) was defined in 1875 as &quot;a confidential officer attached to the &#x27;personal&#x27; or private staff of a general&quot;. In the field of battle, he functioned as &quot;the bearer of his chief&#x27;s written or verbal orders, and when employed as the general&#x27;s mouthpiece must be implicitly obeyed&quot;. In garrison or quarters, however, his duties were more of a social character: &quot;he superintends the general&#x27;s household, writes and answers invitations, &amp;c.&quot; Historically, the appointment pertained only to the Army (in the Navy a flag lieutenant performed equivalent duties: &quot;communicating the admiral&#x27;s orders to the various ships either personally or by signal&quot;). 

According to a British military dictionary dating from 1816, an ADC usually held rank equal to, or more senior than, an army captain. &quot;Generals, being field marshals have four [aides-de-camp], lieutenant generals two, [and] major generals one&quot;.

The sovereign, as head of the army, was entitled to appoint &quot;an indefinite number of aides-de-camp&quot;. Under Queen Victoria, appointments were made (from both the regular Army and the Royal Marines) in recognition of distinguished war service; the appointment at that time carried with it promotion to the rank of full colonel. Additional honorary appointments were made from among the officers of the Militia. Queen Victoria also appointed a number of &quot;naval aides-de-camp&quot; in &quot;compliment to the sister service&quot;.

Colonial governors, governors-general and the lord lieutenant of Ireland also appointed aides-de-camp, who had a functional role akin to that of equerries in the Royal Household in which aides-de-camp have a primarily honorific role.

A distinctive and elaborate full dress uniform used to be worn by army aides-de-camp; however, its use was largely discontinued after World War I.

====Present day====
In the British Army and the RAF, a junior officer may be appointed to serve as aide-de-camp to a senior officer; the equivalent appointment in the Royal Navy is flag lieutenant. Certain of the monarch&#x27;s representatives, including lord-lieutenants of counties, may appoint their own aides-de-camp. 

=====The Royal Household=====
In addition, a fixed number of senior officers may be appointed as aides-de-camp to the monarch, an appointment which entitles the holder to the post-nominal letters &quot;ADC&quot;. Most of these are serving army, navy, and air force officers, usually of colonel or brigadier rank or equivalent. They are seldom called upon individually to perform specific duties; collectively, they walked in procession at every coronation and state funeral of a monarch in the 20th century. In 1991 the aides-de-camp to the queen numbered sixty: 
* Eight from the Royal Navy (captains and commodores)
* Three from the Royal Naval Reserve
* One from the Royal Marines (a colonel)
* One from the Royal Marines Reserve
* Eighteen from the Army (brigadiers)
* Sixteen from the Territorial Army (colonels)
* Twelve from the Royal Air Force (air commodore or group captain)
* One from the Royal Auxiliary Air Force or Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve

There are also, in addition, specific aide-de-camp appointments held by certain very senior officers, including:
* The first and principal naval aide-de-camp
* The flag aide-de-camp
* The aide-de-camp general
* The air aide-de-camp
These are collectively known as the principal aides-de-camp: the first two are individual naval appointments; then, in the present reign, there have usually been up to three aides-de-camp general (&quot;ADC(Gen)&quot;) appointed from the senior ranks of the British Army (one of whom is usually the chief of the General Staff); and up to two air aides-de-camp, from among the senior ranks of the RAF (one of whom is usually the chief of the Air Staff). Principal aides-de-camp, representing the three services, take part along with other members of the Royal Household in the State Processions at State Openings of Parliament, at coronations and at state funerals; and they are occasionally called upon individually to represent the monarch at memorial services and on other occasions.

=====Uniform accoutrements=====
Aides-de-camp, along with equerries, military assistants, military attachés and certain other officers, are distinguished by the addition of aiguillettes to their dress uniforms; these differ in size, colour and position of wear, depending on the appointment. In addition, aides-de-camp to the sovereign wear the monarch&#x27;s royal cypher on their shoulder straps or shoulder boards in various orders of dress.

In the cases of personal aide-de-camp to the monarch and the principal aides-de-camp, the officers concerned continue to wear the royal cypher after relinquishing the appointment; and if he or she has held the appointment under more than one sovereign then the cypher of each is worn. Otherwise, an officer would cease to wear the accoutrements after his or her appointment as aide-de-camp is relinquished (with the exception that former aides-de-camp to the sovereign appointed before 1988 may also continue to wear the royal cypher).

==France==

In France, the president, as commander-in-chief of the French Armed Forces, is served by aides-de-camp. In general, there are three, traditionally including one who is a member of the French Army, and all of whom are lieutenant colonels. In essence, their mission is to transport the briefcase permitting the use of nuclear weapons. They can also provide general assistance to the president: For instance, at times aides-de-camp are seen placing the president&#x27;s speech on his lectern when he arrives, or holding up cue cards for the president during award ceremonies.

When the president travels, an aide-de-camp often rides in the front passenger seat of the presidential car. He is one of the people who are physically closest to the president.

==Greece==

The President of the Hellenic Republic as Head of State of the Hellenic Armed Forces is served by aide-de-camp. They have the Hellenic Air Force, Hellenic Navy, and the Hellenic Army.

==Hong Kong==

The Hong Kong Police Force, the Fire Services Department, the Customs and Excise Department, the Immigration Department, the Government Flying Service, the Civil Aid Service, the Hong Kong Auxiliary Police Force, the Auxiliary Medical Service, the St. John Ambulance Brigade, and the Correctional Services Department each sends an aide-de-camp to the territory&#x27;s chief executive, which replaced the governor in 1997.

On the last day of British rule in Hong Kong on 30 June 1997, the police aide-de-camp to Governor Chris Patten, presented Patten with the flag at Government House. He then gave the Vice Regal Salute before proceeding, with the Pattens, to leave Government House for the last time.

==Imperial Russia==
In the 18th-century, under Catherine the Great of Russia, favourites of the Empress were frequently appointed as her aides-de-camp.

During World War I, distinguished officers were appointed as Emperor&#x27;s aide-de-camp on a rotating basis. In November 1916, future Civil War White Army general Pyotr Wrangel (who was a regiment commander at the time) spent a few days as an aide-de-camp for Nicholas II of Russia. 

==Indonesia==

In Indonesia, an aide-de-camp, known as an &quot;ajudan presiden&quot; or &quot;president&#x27;s adjutant&quot; to the president and vice president of Indonesia is provided by officers from the Indonesian National Armed Forces, with the rank of colonel, and/or the Indonesian National Police, with the rank of Police Chief Commissioner. They are tasked with providing staff support and daily administrative services to the president and vice president as well as to their spouses, either in their official capacities or for personal affairs. They are recognized by their golden aiguillettes. 

Other VIPs in Indonesia, such as ministers and other important government officials, are also provided ADCs who are usually junior-ranking officers, such as lieutenants in the military, or police inspectors from the police, who are generally newly graduated from the military and/or police academies. ADCs for regional officials, such as governors and Mayors, known as Regents, are provided ADCs from new graduates of the Institute of Domestic Governance (IPDN).

==Ireland==
The president of Ireland, as supreme commander of the Irish Defence Forces, is served by aides-de-camp who assist with day-to-day presidential duties, accompany the president on official public engagements in Ireland and on state visits abroad, and represent the president at funerals and on state occasions. There is an ADC on duty 24/7 at Áras an Uachtaráin.

Michael Collins was aide-de-camp and bodyguard to Joseph Plunkett during the Easter Rising in 1916.

==Japan==

From 1896 until the end of World War II, the emperors of Japan had army and naval aides-de-camp.

==Portugal==
The president, as commander-in-chief of the Portuguese armed forces, is served by three aides-de-camp, one from the Portuguese Army, one from the Portuguese Navy and one from the Portuguese Air Force. These aides-de-camp integrate the Presidential Military Household. Portuguese aides-de-camp never stay for more than one presidential term, which is five years in duration, after which the return to their respective branches.

== Serbia ==
In the Principality of Serbia and later in the Kingdom of Serbia, the Monarch&#x27;s Aide-de-Camp held a pivotal position that bridged the monarchy and military affairs. This role encompassed critical responsibilities in national defence, such as advising on military strategy, overseeing the arming and training of the armed forces, and supporting diplomatic engagements. Aides-de-Camp provided invaluable assistance to the monarchy in managing complex and sensitive state and military matters, ensuring smooth coordination with the armed forces. Through their duties, Serbian monarch aides-de-camp embodied royal dignity, led ceremonial functions at court, and stood as enduring symbols of the monarchy’s authority and stability.

== Spain ==
In Spain, the Royal Household has, within the King&#x27;s Military Chamber or Military Staff, an undetermined number of aides-de-camp, according to Royal Decree 434/1988, of May 6, in its wording given by Royal Decree 772/2015, of August 28. Until 2015, there were 10 aides in the service of the King, as well as an undetermined number for the Prince of Asturias. Since the reform of August 2015, the number of assistants is not specified, although they must have the military ranks of commander or corvette captain (OF-3), lieutenant colonel or frigate captain (OF-4) or colonel or ship-of-the-line captain (OF-5). Likewise, the requirement that the first assistant must have the rank of general (OF-6 or higher) is maintained, since he is also the head of the King&#x27;s Military Chamber.

As of 2025, the King of Spain has nine aides-de-camp at his service (not counting the first aide): four from the Army, two from the Navy, two from the Air and Space Force and one from the Civil Guard. These take turns 24 hours a day, every day of the year.

==Thailand==

The Royal Thai Aide-De-Camp Department is a royal service agency under the Royal Security Command. It is responsible for organizing royal appearances and maintaining the safety of the Thai royal family. Royal Thai aides-de-camp are also appointed to senior officers of the Thai Army, Navy, and Air Force. King Chulalongkorn initiated the Royal Guard in 1870, during his visit to Singapore and Indonesia. He had a lieutenant general who served as his aide, who was considered the first Thai aide-de-camp.

==United States==
Military officers are assigned as aides to the Secretary of the Army, Secretary of Defense, vice president, and president of the United States. For government officials with more than one aide, the senior-ranking aide usually coordinates the activities of the other aides as well as personal attendants such as drivers or orderlies.

The president has six military aides, one from each of the armed services. The president&#x27;s aides from the Army, Marine Corps, Air Force and Space Force are majors or lieutenant colonels, and the aides from the Navy and Coast Guard are lieutenant commanders or commanders. One of their major roles is to hold the presidential nuclear football. In addition to the six permanent aides-de-camp, there are some 40–45 military social aides holding more junior ranks from lieutenant to major. Their appointment is temporary and part-time, serving for perhaps two to four afternoons a month as required, for social purposes such as gatherings hosted at the White House.

In the United States Army, aides-de-camp are specifically appointed to general-grade officers (NATO Code OF-6 through OF-10). The usual tour of duty for aides is up to two years. Although Congress has authorized general officers to be assigned up to three officer aides, their number and rank being contingent upon the general&#x27;s grade, Army regulations have traditionally limited each general to a single officer aide. Some generals are also authorized to have enlisted aides on their staff. A general, based on his or her grade, may choose for an aide-de-camp any commissioned officer up to the following maximum rank:

:Brigadier general: first lieutenant
:Major general: captain
:Lieutenant general: major
:General: lieutenant colonel
:Chief of staff, U.S. Army: lieutenant colonel, and four authorized enlisted aides
:General of the army: lieutenant colonel, and three authorized enlisted aides

Lieutenant colonels and colonels in command of units (battalions and brigades, respectively) do not have aides. Occasionally, the unit&#x27;s adjutant (S1) will assist the commanding officer as an aide, but this is uncommon. A general of the army does not retire and remains an officer of the United States Army for life, and is entitled to an aide.

U.S. Army aides-de-camp wear a special device in place of the branch-of-service insignia, representing their affiliation with infantry, artillery, or quartermaster, that they would otherwise wear on the lapels of their service uniform. The rank of the general officer being served is indicated on the device worn by the aide-de-camp, as illustrated below. Although the chief of staff of the Army and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff are O-10 positions, their aides-de-camp wear devices specific to those offices, rather than the normal four-star aide device. Also, an aide-de-camp wears a special aiguillette on the shoulder of his or her dress uniform.
In the U.S. Navy, the aide-de-camp to an admiral is also known as a &quot;flag aide&quot; (command ashore) or &quot;flag lieutenant&quot; (command afloat).

The highest honor of the U.S. state of Tennessee is &quot;Colonel Aide de Camp&quot;. These colonels serve as the personal aides-de-camp to the governor of Tennessee, and their appointments are recorded by the Secretary of State of Tennessee with those who have been commissioned into the State Guard and Tennessee National Guard.

<doc id="239483" wikidata="Q1468969" url="?curid=239483" title="Minnesota Muskies">
<text>The Minnesota Muskies were a member of the American Basketball Association, born with the league&#x27;s creation on February 2, 1967. L.P. Shields and Fred Jefferson were the owners after paying a franchise fee of $30,000. The team then played one season in Minnesota before moving to Miami, Florida to become The Floridians. The team colors were blue and gold and games were played in the Met Center in Bloomington, Minnesota, which they shared with the Minnesota North Stars. 

==History==
The ABA first located its league office in Minneapolis and the future looked bright for the Muskies (named after the Muskellunge; also known as the muskie, one of the regions the fish is found in Minnesota), who shared the same offices as the league itself. Their first draft pick was talented center Mel Daniels, who would go on to become one of the ABA&#x27;s most celebrated players. Daniels was also a first round draft pick of the NBA&#x27;s Cincinnati Royals, but he decided to cast his lot with the upstart league. The selection of Daniels paid off for the team as he led the league in field goal attempts, field goals made, offensive and defensive rebounds and was named the league&#x27;s Rookie of the Year. Daniels, Donnie Freeman and Les Hunter all represented the Muskies in the first ABA All Star Game and shooting guard Ron Perry finished fifth in the league in three-point field goals made and attempted and fourth in three-point field goal percentage. The head coach was Jim Pollard, a former teammate of ABA Commissioner George Mikan from their days with the NBA&#x27;s Minneapolis Lakers. The Muskies would win 50 games in their lone season under that franchise name.

Early in the league&#x27;s first season, the Muskies and the Indiana Pacers dueled for first place in the Eastern Division. Although the Muskies pulled away from the Pacers, the Pittsburgh Pipers rallied to eventually win the Eastern Division title by four games instead. The Muskies would finish the season with a record of 50 wins and 28 losses.

In the Eastern Division playoff semifinals, the Muskies split the first four of five games with the Kentucky Colonels and then won the decisive Game Five, 114–108, at home. The Muskies then met the Pipers for the Eastern Division Championship and lost 4 games to 1 to the eventual champion.

=== 1967–68 ABA season ===
For their success on the court, the Muskies were a complete bust off the court. They lost an estimated $400,000 in their first and only season. They only averaged 2,800 people per game, but it might have been far less, given that they only sold 100 season tickets at the time. The Muskies&#x27; management sought to make changes for the upcoming 1968–69 season with the team planning to play nine of their home games at other locations in Minnesota and signed a favorable television contract. In spite of this, the owners decided to relocate the franchise to Miami, Florida on May 24, 1968, for the 1968–69 ABA season. Prior to the start of that season, the team was forced to sell off Daniels to the Indiana Pacers in a trade for cash in order to pay off accumulated debts from the previous season.

However, Minnesota was not left without an ABA team for long, as the league champion Pipers ironically relocated to Minneapolis to play as the Minnesota Pipers for the 1968–69 ABA season. The franchise would move back to Pittsburgh after their own sole season in Minnesota, with the ABA not bothering to return to Minnesota again following George Mikan&#x27;s resignation as commissioner of the ABA and subsequently moving the ABA&#x27;s headquarters to New York (who would also be home to the New York Nets for the rest of the ABA&#x27;s tenure) instead.

The Minnesota Timberwolves wore Muskies uniforms for six games during the 2011–12 NBA season as part of the NBA&#x27;s &quot;Hardwood Classics&quot;.

<text>Trudi Le Caine, CM (née Gertrude Janowski, 1911 – September 5, 1999) was an arts patron involved with local and national arts initiatives in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

Born in Passau, Bavaria, she spent her youth in Teplitz-Schönau/Teplice-Šanov, Czechoslovakia before joining her stepfather, Arnold Walter, in Berlin, where he was a music editor and critic for the leftist journals &quot;Die Weltbühne&quot; and &quot;Vorwärts&quot;. After fleeing Germany following the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, she lived first in Spain (which she had to leave after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936) and France (where she studied at the Sorbonne) before emigrating to Canada to join her parents. She settled in Ottawa in 1942, where her involvement with &quot;Le Groupe de la Place Royale&quot;, Opera Lyra Ottawa and the Council for the Arts in Ottawa led to recognition and awards such as the Order of Canada, the Lescarbot Award and the Victor Tolgesy Arts Award.

Though she had no children of her own, she made children&#x27;s music education one of her causes, helping establish the Ottawa Children&#x27;s Concerts in 1946 and later becoming a proponent of the Orff Approach (Orff Schulwerk, also called Music for Children) in music education in the Ottawa area. LeCaine also taught French at Broadview Public School in Ottawa. She also convinced the National Capital Commission to open the Rideau Canal during the winter for skating, which has now become famous as the world&#x27;s longest skating rink.

In her honour, the Community Foundation of Ottawa-Carleton maintains the Trudi LeCaine Fund.

She was close to 50 when she married Hugh Le Caine, Canadian physicist and pioneer electronic musician.

<doc id="239486" wikidata="Q13212246" url="?curid=239486" title="League of Cambrai">
<text>The League of Cambrai was a military coalition against the Republic of Venice formed on 8 December 1508, by the main European powers (Holy Roman Empire, Spain and France), to maintain their hegemony over the Italian Peninsula.

== Membership ==
The following were members of the League: Maximilian I (Holy Roman Emperor), Louis XII (King of France), Ferdinand II of Aragon (King of Naples and Sicily), Julius II (Sovereign of the Ecclesiastical State), Alfonso I d&#x27;Este (Duke of Ferrara), Carlo III (Duke of Savoy), Francesco II Gonzaga (Marquess of Mantua) and Vladislaus II (King of Hungary).

== Objectives ==
The treaty was signed in the Picard town of Cambrai. In its preamble, a stated pretext for the treaty is peace between the Holy Roman Emperor and the Duke of Guelders, mediated by Spanish and Papal ambassadors. The following was also remarked against the Venetian Republic:

The Treaty of Cambrai stipulated the following partition of Venice&#x27;s mainland and overseas territories:

* to the Holy Roman Empire: Treviso, Padua, Vicenza, Verona, Friuli, and Istria
* to the Kingdom of France: Brescia, Bergamo, Crema, Cremona, and Gera d&#x27;Adda
* to the Spanish Empire: Trani, Brindisi, Otranto and Gallipoli
* to the Papal States: Ravenna, Cervia, Rimini, Faenza and its castles, and also some possessions near Cesena and Imola
* to the Duchy of Ferrara: Polesine, Este, and Scodosia di Montagna
* to the Marquisate of Mantua: Peschiera, Asola, and Lonato

* to the Kingdom of Hungary, if it joined the alliance: Dalmatia

* to the Duchy of Savoy, if it joined the alliance: Cyprus

== Conflict ==

For some time, Venice had developed suspicions of an emerging alliance against them, in some part due to hostile speeches by the French ambassador.

The League fought against Venetian forces between 1508 and 1511. After they routed the Venetian army in Battle of Agnadello, they invaded Veneto and marched on Venice; however, they were defeated by Bartolomeo d&#x27;Alviano at the Siege of Padua. The Venetians began a counter-offensive campaign, retaking a large part of Veneto but suffering defeat at the naval battle of Polesella.

In 1510, Pope Julius II left the League and allied with the Venetians against France, having grown suspicious of French ambitions in Italy. The League of Cambrai was effectively dissolved the following year, when Spain and the Holy Roman Empire also abandoned the League to join Venetian and Papal forces in a new multi-nation alliance called the Holy League, designed to check French power.

<text>The Federal Republic of Germany has a plural multi-party system. Historically, the largest by members and parliament seats are the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), with its sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU) and Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). Germany also has a number of other parties, in recent history most importantly the Free Democratic Party (FDP), Alliance 90/The Greens, The Left, and more recently the Alternative for Germany (AfD). The federal government of Germany often consisted of a coalition of a major and a minor party, specifically CDU/CSU and FDP or SPD and FDP, and from 1998 to 2005 SPD and Greens. From 1966 to 1969, from 2005 to 2009 and from 2013 to 2021, the federal government consisted of a coalition of the two major parties, called a grand coalition.

Coalitions in the Bundestag and state legislatures are often described by party colors. Party colors are red for the Social Democratic Party, green for Alliance 90/The Greens, yellow for the Free Democratic Party, purple (officially red, which is customarily used for the SPD) for the Left, light blue for the AfD, and black and blue for the CDU and CSU respectively.

<text>Max Weber (2 August 1897 in Zürich – 2 December 1974 in Bern) was a Swiss politician.

A member of the Social Democratic Party, Weber was seven times elected to the National Council, the lower house of the Swiss parliament (the Federal Assembly), serving continuously from 4 December 1939 to 31 December 1951 and then again from 5 December 1955 to 28 November 1971.

On 13 December 1951 he was elected to the Swiss Federal Council (the seven-member executive that constitutes Switzerland&#x27;s federal government) where he headed the Federal Department of Finance from 1 January 1952 until 31 December 1953. Weber decided to resign from his seat on the Council with effect from 31 January 1954 after a referendum held on 6 December 1953 had rejected his federal budget proposals.

<doc id="239497" wikidata="Q593744" url="?curid=239497" title="Knowledge base">
<text>In computer science, a knowledge base (KB) is a set of sentences, each sentence given in a knowledge representation language, with interfaces to tell new sentences and to ask questions about what is known, where either of these interfaces might use inference. It is a technology used to store complex structured data used by a computer system. The initial use of the term was in connection with expert systems, which were the first knowledge-based systems.

==Original usage of the term==
The original use of the term knowledge base was to describe one of the two sub-systems of an expert system. A knowledge-based system consists of a knowledge-base representing facts about the world and ways of reasoning about those facts to deduce new facts or highlight inconsistencies.

==Properties==
The term &quot;knowledge-base&quot; was coined to distinguish this form of knowledge store from the more common and widely used term &quot;database&quot;. During the 1970s, virtually all large management information systems stored their data in some type of hierarchical or relational database. At this point in the history of information technology, the distinction between a database and a knowledge-base was clear and unambiguous.

A database had the following properties:

* Flat data: Data was usually represented in a tabular format with strings or numbers in each field.
* Multiple users: A conventional database needed to support more than one user or system logged into the same data at the same time.
* Transactions: An essential requirement for a database was to maintain integrity and consistency among data accessed by concurrent users. These are the so-called ACID properties: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.
* Large, long-lived data: A corporate database needed to support not just thousands but hundreds of thousands or more rows of data. Such a database usually needed to persist past the specific uses of any individual program; it needed to store data for years and decades rather than for the life of a program.

The first knowledge-based systems had data needs that were the opposite of these database requirements. An expert system requires structured data. Not just tables with numbers and strings, but pointers to other objects that in turn have additional pointers. The ideal representation for a knowledge base is an object model (often called an ontology in artificial intelligence literature) with classes, subclasses and instances.

Early expert systems also had little need for multiple users or the complexity that comes with requiring transactional properties on data. The data in early expert systems was used to arrive at a specific answer, such as a medical diagnosis, the design of a molecule, or a response to an emergency. Once the solution to the problem was known, there was not a critical demand to store large amounts of data back to a permanent memory store. A more precise statement would be that given the technologies available, researchers compromised and did without these capabilities because they realized they were beyond what could be expected, and they could develop useful solutions to non-trivial problems without them. Even from the beginning, the more astute researchers realized the potential benefits of being able to store, analyze, and reuse knowledge. For example, see the discussion of Corporate Memory in the earliest work of the Knowledge-Based Software Assistant program by Cordell Green et al.

The volume requirements were also different for a knowledge-base compared to a conventional database. The knowledge-base needed to know facts about the world. For example, to represent the statement that &quot;All humans are mortal&quot;, a database typically could not represent this general knowledge but instead would need to store information about thousands of tables that represented information about specific humans. Representing that all humans are mortal and being able to reason about any given human that they are mortal is the work of a knowledge-base. Representing that George, Mary, Sam, Jenna, Mike... and hundreds of thousands of other customers are all humans with specific ages, sex, address, etc. is the work for a database.

As expert systems moved from being prototypes to systems deployed in corporate environments the requirements for their data storage rapidly started to overlap with the standard database requirements for multiple, distributed users with support for transactions. Initially, the demand could be seen in two different but competitive markets. From the AI and Object-Oriented communities, object-oriented databases such as Versant emerged. These were systems designed from the ground up to have support for object-oriented capabilities but also to support standard database services as well. On the other hand, the large database vendors such as Oracle added capabilities to their products that provided support for knowledge-base requirements such as class-subclass relations and rules.

==Internet as a knowledge base==
The next evolution for the term &quot;knowledge-base&quot; was the Internet. With the rise of the Internet, documents, hypertext, and multimedia support were now critical for any corporate database. It was no longer enough to support large tables of data or relatively small objects that lived primarily in computer memory. Support for corporate web sites required persistence and transactions for documents. This created a whole new discipline known as Web Content Management.

The other driver for document support was the rise of knowledge management vendors such as HCL Notes (formerly Lotus Notes). Knowledge Management actually predated the Internet but with the Internet there was great synergy between the two areas. Knowledge management products adopted the term &quot;knowledge-base&quot; to describe their repositories but the meaning had a big difference. In the case of previous knowledge-based systems, the knowledge was primarily for the use of an automated system, to reason about and draw conclusions about the world. With knowledge management products, the knowledge was primarily meant for humans, for example to serve as a repository of manuals, procedures, policies, best practices, reusable designs and code, etc. In both cases the distinctions between the uses and kinds of systems were ill-defined. As the technology scaled up it was rare to find a system that could really be cleanly classified as knowledge-based in the sense of an expert system that performed automated reasoning and knowledge-based in the sense of knowledge management that provided knowledge in the form of documents and media that could be leveraged by humans.

<text>The Italian Wars were a series of conflicts fought between 1494 and 1559, mostly in the Italian Peninsula, but later expanding into Flanders, the Rhineland and Mediterranean Sea. The primary belligerents were the Valois kings of France, on one side, and their opponents in the Holy Roman Empire and Spain on the other. At different points, various Italian states participated in the war, some on both sides, with limited involvement from England, Switzerland, and the Ottoman Empire.

The Italic League established in 1454 achieved a balance of power in Italy, but fell apart after the death of its chief architect, Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici, in 1492. Combined with the ambition of Ludovico Sforza, its collapse allowed Charles VIII of France to invade Naples in 1494, which drew in Spain and the Holy Roman Empire. Although Charles was forced to withdraw in 1495, ongoing political divisions among the Italian states made them a battleground in the struggle for European domination between France and the Habsburgs.

Fought with considerable brutality, the wars took place against the background of religious turmoil caused by the Reformation, particularly in France and the Holy Roman Empire. They are seen as a turning point in the evolution from medieval to modern warfare, with the use of the arquebus or handgun becoming common, along with significant technological improvements in siege artillery. Literate commanders and modern printing methods also make them one of the first conflicts with a significant number of contemporary accounts, including those of Francesco Guicciardini, Niccolò Machiavelli, and Blaise de Montluc.

After 1503, most of the fighting was initiated by French invasions of Lombardy and Piedmont, but although able to hold territory for periods of time, they could not do so permanently. By 1557, the growth of Protestantism meant the major belligerents faced internal conflict over religion, forcing them to refocus on domestic affairs. This led to the Treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis, under which France was largely expelled from Italy, but in exchange gained Calais from England, and the Three Bishoprics from Lorraine. In turn, Spain acquired sovereignty over the Kingdom of Naples and Kingdom of Sicily in southern Italy, as well the Duchy of Milan in northern Italy.

==Background==
Largely driven by the rivalry between the Republic of Venice and the Duchy of Milan, the long-running Wars in Lombardy had finally been ended by the 1454 Treaty of Lodi. Followed shortly thereafter by a non-aggression pact known as the Italic League, it led to a forty-year period of stability and economic expansion, marred only by the 1479 to 1481 Pazzi conspiracy and 1482 to 1484 War of Ferrara. The League&#x27;s main supporter was the Florentine ruler Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici, who also pursued a policy of excluding France and the Holy Roman Empire from the Italian peninsula.

Lorenzo&#x27;s death in April 1492 severely weakened the League at a time when France was seeking to expand in Italy. This originated when Louis XI of France inherited the County of Provence from his cousin Charles IV of Anjou in 1481, along with the Angevin claim to the Kingdom of Naples. His son Charles VIII succeeded him in 1483 and formally incorporated Provence into France in 1486; its ports of Marseille and Toulon provided direct access to the Mediterranean and thus the ability to pursue his territorial ambitions.

In the run-up to the First Italian War, Charles sought to secure the neutrality of other European rulers through a series of treaties. These included the November 1492 Peace of Étaples with Henry VII of England and the March 1493 Treaty of Barcelona with Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor.

==History==

===Italian War of 1494–1495===

The war began when Ludovico Sforza, then Regent of Milan, encouraged Charles VIII of France to invade Italy, using the Angevin claim to the throne of Naples as a pretext. This in turn was driven by the intense rivalry between Ludovico&#x27;s wife, Beatrice d&#x27;Este, and that of his nephew Gian Galeazzo Sforza, husband of Isabella of Aragon. Despite being the hereditary Duke of Milan, Gian Galeazzo had been sidelined by his uncle in 1481 and exiled to Pavia. Both women wanted to ensure their children inherited the Duchy and when Isabella&#x27;s father became Alfonso II of Naples in January 1494, she asked for his help in securing their rights. In September Charles invaded the peninsula, which he justified by claiming he wanted to use Naples as a base for a crusade against the Ottoman Turks.

In October, Ludovico formally became Duke of Milan following the death of Gian Galeazzo, who was popularly supposed to have been poisoned by his uncle, and the French marched through Italy virtually unopposed, entering Pisa on 8 November, Florence on 17th, and Rome on 31 December. Charles was backed by Girolamo Savonarola, who used the opportunity to established a short-lived theocracy in Florence, while Pope Alexander VI allowed his army free passage through the Papal States.

In February 1495, the French reached Monte San Giovanni Campano in the Kingdom of Naples and despatched envoys to negotiate terms with its Neapolitan garrison, who murdered them and sent their mutilated bodies back to the French lines. On 9 February, the enraged besiegers breached the walls of the castle with artillery fire, then stormed it, killing everyone inside. Known as the &quot;Sack of Naples&quot;, widespread outrage within Italy allied with concern over the power of France led to the formation of the League of Venice on 31 March 1495, an anti-French alliance composed of Republic of Venice, Milan, Spain, and the Holy Roman Empire.

Later joined by Florence, following the overthrow of Savonarola, the Papal States and Mantua, this coalition cut off Charles and his army from their bases in France. Charles&#x27; cousin, Louis d&#x27;Orleans, now tried to take advantage of Ludovico&#x27;s change of sides to conquer Milan, which he claimed through his grandmother, Valentina Visconti. On 11 June, he captured Novara when the garrison defected, and reached Vigevano, forty kilometres from Milan. At this crucial point, Ludovico was incapacitated either by a stroke or nervous breakdown, while his unpaid soldiers were on the verge of mutiny. In his absence, his wife Beatrice d&#x27;Este took personal control of the Duchy and the siege of Novara, with Louis eventually forced to surrender in return for his freedom.

Having replaced Ferdinand II of Naples with a pro-French government, Charles turned north and on 6 July was intercepted by the League outside Fornovo di Taro. In the resulting Battle of Fornovo, the French forced their opponents back across the Taro river and continued onto Asti, leaving most of their supplies behind. Both sides claimed victory but the general consensus favoured the French, since the League suffered heavier casualties and failed to halt their retreat, the reason for fighting in the first place. In the south, despite some initial reverses, by September 1495 Ferdinand II had regained control of his kingdom. Although the French invasion achieved little, it showed the Italian states were rich and comparatively weak, making future intervention attractive to outside powers. Charles himself died on 7 April 1498, and was succeeded by the former Duke of Orleans, who became Louis XII.

===Italian Wars of 1499–1504===

The next phase of the conflict originated in the long-standing rivalry between Florence and the Republic of Pisa, which had been annexed by Florence in 1406 but took advantage of the French invasion to regain its independence in 1494. Despite Charles&#x27; retreat in 1495, Pisa continued to receive support from Genoa, Venice and Milan, all of whom were suspicious of Florentine power. In order to strengthen his own position, Ludovico once again invited an external power to settle an internal Italian affair, in this case Emperor Maximilian I. In doing so, Maximilian hoped to bolster the League of Venice, which he viewed as an essential barrier to French intervention, but Florence was convinced he favoured Pisa and refused to accept mediation. To enforce a settlement, in July 1496 Maximilian besieged the Florentine city of Livorno, but withdrew in September due to shortages of men and supplies.

Following the death of Charles VIII in April 1498, Louis XII began planning another attempt on Milan, while also pursuing his predecessor&#x27;s claim to the Kingdom of Naples. Aware of the hostility caused by French ambitions in Italy, in July 1498 he renewed the 1492 Peace of Étaples with England and signed a treaty confirming French borders with Burgundy. This was followed in August by the Treaty of Marcoussis with Ferdinand II of Aragon; although it did not address outstanding territorial disputes between the two countries, it agreed &quot;have all enemies in common except the Pope.&quot; On 9 February 1499, Louis signed the Treaty of Blois, a military alliance with Venice against Ludovico.

With these agreements finalised, a French army of 27,000 under the Milanese exile Gian Giacomo Trivulzio invaded Lombardy, and in August besieged Rocca d&#x27;Arazzo, a fortified town in the western part of the Duchy of Milan. The French siege artillery breached the walls in less than five hours and after the town capitulated, Louis ordered the execution of its garrison and senior members of the civil administration. Other Milanese strongholds surrendered rather than face the same fate, while Ludovico, whose wife Beatrice had died in 1497, fled the duchy with his children and took refuge with Maximilian. On 6 October 1499, Louis made a triumphant entry into Milan.

Florence now asked for French assistance in retaking Pisa, a request Louis was in no hurry to fulfil since they had refused to support his capture of Milan. He was also initially occupied in defeating efforts to regain his duchy by Ludovico, who was captured at Novaro in April 1500 and spent the rest of his life in a French prison. However, Louis needed to maintain good relations with Florence, whose territory he would have to cross in order to conquer Naples, and on 29 June 1500 a combined Franco-Florentine army appeared outside Pisa. Once again, the French artillery quickly opened a gap in the walls but several assaults were repulsed and the siege was abandoned on 11 July.

With Milan firmly in his control, Louis returned to France and left the Florentines to blockade Pisa, which eventually surrendered in 1509. Anxious to begin the conquest of Naples, on 11 November he signed the Treaty of Granada with Ferdinand II of Aragon, an agreement to divide the kingdom between the two. Since Ferdinand had supported the expulsion of the French from Naples in 1495, Louis hoped these concessions would allow him to acquire the bulk of the kingdom without an expensive war. His action was criticised by contemporaries like Niccolò Machiavelli and modern historians, who argue the 1499 Treaty of Marcoussis already gave Louis everything he needed, while inviting Spain into Naples could only work to his detriment.

In July 1501, the French army reached Capua; strongly defended by forces loyal to Frederick of Naples, it surrendered on 24 July after a short siege but was then sacked. In addition to the extensive material destruction, many women were subjected to mass rape and estimates of the dead ranged from 2,000 to 4,000, actions that caused consternation throughout Italy. Resistance crumbled as other towns tried to avoid the same fate and on 12 October Louis appointed the Duke of Nemours his viceroy in Naples. However, the Treaty of Granada had left the ownership of key Neapolitan territories undecided and disputes over these quickly poisoned relationships between the two powers. This led to war in late 1502, which ended with the French being expelled from Naples once again after defeats at Cerignola on 28 April 1503, and Garigliano on 29 December.

===War of the League of Cambrai===

On 18 October 1503, Pius III was replaced by Pope Julius II, who as ruler of the Papal States was concerned by Venetian power in northern Italy. This fear was shared by his home town of Genoa, which also resented its expulsion from the Po Valley, and Maximilian, whose acquisition of Gorizia in 1500 was threatened by Venetian possession of neighbouring Friuli. Milan, controlled by Louis XII, was a long-standing opponent of Venice, while Ferdinand II, now king of Naples, wished to regain control of Venetian ports on the southern Adriatic coast. Along with the Duchy of Ferrara, Julius united these disparate interests into the anti-Venetian League of Cambrai, signed on 10 December 1508.

Although the French largely destroyed a Venetian army at Agnadello on 14 May 1509, Maximilian failed to capture Padua and withdrew from Italy. Now seeing the power of Louis XII as the greater threat, in February 1510 Pope Julius made peace with Venice, followed in March by an agreement with the Swiss Cantons to supply him with 6,000 mercenaries. After a year of fighting in which Louis XII occupied large parts of the Papal States, in October 1511 Julius formed the anti-French Holy League, which included Henry VIII of England, Maximilian and Spain.

A French army defeated the Spanish at Ravenna on 11 April 1512, but their leader Gaston de Foix was killed, while the Swiss recaptured Milan and restored Ludovico&#x27;s son Massimiliano Sforza as duke. The members of the League then fell out over dividing the spoils and the death of Pope Julius on 20 February 1513 left it without effective leadership. In March, Venice and France formed an alliance, but from June to September 1513 the League won victories at Novara and La Motta in Lombardy, Guinegate in Flanders and Flodden in England. Despite this, fighting continued in Italy, with neither side able to gain a decisive advantage.

On 1 January 1515, Louis XII died and was succeeded by his son-in-law, Francis I, who took up his predecessor&#x27;s cause and routed the Swiss at Marignano on 13–14 September 1515. Combined with the unpopularity of Massiliano Sforza, victory allowed Francis to retake Milan and the Holy League collapsed as both Spain and Pope Leo X saw little benefit in fighting on. In the treaty of Noyon, signed on 13 August 1516, Charles I of Spain acknowledged Francis as Duke of Milan, while Francis &quot;passed&quot; his claim to Naples onto Charles. Left isolated, in December Maximilian signed the Treaty of Brussels, which confirmed French possession of Milan.

===Italian War of 1521–1526===

Following the death of Maximilian in January 1519, the German Princes elected Charles I of Spain as Emperor Charles V on 28 June. This brought Spain, the Low Countries and the Holy Roman Empire under one ruler, and meant France was surrounded by the so-called &quot;Habsburg ring&quot;. Francis I had also been a candidate for the Imperial throne, adding a personal dimension to his rivalry with Charles that became one of the fundamental conflicts of the sixteenth century.

Planning an offensive against Habsburg possessions in Navarre and Flanders, Francis first secured his position in Italy by agreeing a new alliance with Venice. As Leo X had backed his candidacy for Emperor, he also counted on Papal support but Leo sided with Charles in return for his help against Martin Luther and his proposed reforms to the Catholic church. In November 1521, an Imperial-Papal army under Prospero Colonna and the Marquis of Pescara captured Milan and restored Francesco Sforza as duke. After Leo died in December, Adrian VI was elected Pope on 9 January 1522, while a French attempt to retake Milan was ended by defeat at Bicocca on 27 April.

In May 1522, England joined the Imperial alliance and declared war on France. Venice left the war in July 1523, while Adrian died in November and was succeeded by Clement VII, who tried to negotiate an end to the fighting without success. Although France had lost ground in Lombardy and been invaded by English, Imperial and Spanish armies, her opponents had differing objectives and failed to co-ordinate their attacks. Since Papal policy was to prevent either France or the Empire from becoming too powerful, in late 1524 Clement secretly allied himself with Francis, enabling him to mount another offensive against Milan. On 24 February 1525, the French army suffered a devastating defeat at Pavia, in which Francis was captured and imprisoned in Spain.

This led to frantic diplomatic manoeuvres to secure his release, including a French mission to Suleiman the Magnificent, asking for Ottoman assistance. Although Suleiman avoided involvement on this occasion, it was the beginning of a long-standing, if often unacknowledged, Franco-Turkish relationship. Francis was eventually released in March 1526 after signing the Treaty of Madrid, in which he renounced French claims to Artois, Milan and Burgundy.

===War of the League of Cognac===

Once Francis was free, his Council renounced the Treaty of Madrid, claiming conditions extorted under duress could not be considered binding. Concerned that Imperial power now posed a threat to Papal independence, on 22 May 1526 Clement VII formed the League of Cognac, whose members included France, the Papal States, Venice, Florence and Milan. Many of the Imperial troops were close to mutiny having not been paid for months and the Duke of Urbino, commander of the League army, hoped to take advantage of this confusion. However, he delayed taking the offensive awaiting additional Swiss reinforcements.

Although the League gained an easy victory on 24 June when the Venetians occupied Lodi, this delay allowed Charles to gather fresh troops and support a Milanese revolt in July against Francesco Sforza, who was once again forced into exile. In September, Charles financed an attack on Rome by the Colonna family, who competed with the rival Orsinis for control of the city, and Clement was forced to pay them to withdraw. Seeking to recapture Milan, Francis invaded Lombardy at the beginning of 1527, with an army financed by Henry VIII, who hoped thereby to win Papal support for divorcing his first wife, Katherine of Aragon.

In May, Imperial troops, many of whom were followers of Martin Luther, sacked Rome and besieged Clement in the Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo, while Urbino and the League army sat outside and failed to intervene. Although the French marched south to relieve Rome, they were too late to prevent Clement making peace with Charles V in November. Meanwhile, Venice, the largest and most powerful of the Italian states and which also possessed the most effective army, now refused to contribute any more troops to the League. Weakened by its losses in 1509 to 1517 and with its maritime possessions increasingly threatened by the Ottomans, under Andrea Gritti the Republic tried to remain neutral and after 1529 avoided participation in the fighting.
Supported by a Genoese fleet, in April 1528 a French expeditionary force besieged Naples before disease forced them to withdraw in August. Both sides were now anxious to end the war and after another French defeat at Landriano on 21 June 1529, Francis agreed the Treaty of Cambrai with Charles in August. Known as the &quot;Peace of the Ladies&quot; because it was negotiated by Francis&#x27;s mother, Louise of Savoy, and Charles&#x27;s aunt Margaret, Francis recognised Charles as ruler of Milan, Naples, Flanders and Artois. Venice also made peace, leaving only Florence, which had expelled their Medici rulers in 1527. At Bologna in the summer of 1529, Charles V was named King of Italy; he agreed to restore the Medici on behalf of Pope Clement, who was himself a Medici, and after a lengthy siege, Florence surrendered in August 1530.

Prior to 1530, interference by foreign powers in Italy was viewed as a short-term problem, since they could not sustain it over time; for example, French conquests of Naples in 1494 and 1501 and Milan in 1499 and 1515 were quickly reversed. On the other hand, Venice was generally viewed by other states as the greatest threat because it was an &quot;Italian&quot; power. Many assumed the primacy established at Bologna by Charles V in Italy would also soon pass but instead it was the start of a long period of Imperial dominance. One factor was Venice&#x27;s withdrawal from Italian affairs after 1530 in favour of protecting its maritime empire from Ottoman expansion.

===Italian War of 1536–1538===

Under the Treaty of Cambrai, Francesco Sforza was reinstated as Duke of Milan; since he had no children, it also stated Charles V would inherit the duchy on his death, which occurred on 1 November 1535. Francis refused to accept this, arguing Milan was rightfully his along with Genoa and Asti, and once again prepared for war. In April 1536, pro-Valois elements in Asti expelled the Imperial garrison and a French army under Philippe de Chabot occupied Turin, although they failed to take Milan.

In response, a Spanish army invaded Provence and captured Aix on 13 August 1536, before withdrawing, a fruitless expedition that diverted resources from Italy, where the situation had become more serious. The 1536 Franco-Ottoman alliance, a comprehensive treaty covering a wide range of commercial and diplomatic issues, also agreed to a joint assault on Genoa, with French land forces supported by an Ottoman fleet.

Finding the garrison of Genoa had recently been reinforced while a planned internal uprising failed to materialise, the French instead occupied the towns of Pinerolo, Chieri and Carmagnola in Piedmont. Fighting continued in Flanders and northern Italy throughout 1537, while the Ottoman fleet raided the coastal areas around Naples, raising fears of invasion throughout Italy. Pope Paul III, who had replaced Clement in 1534, grew increasingly anxious to end the war and brought the two sides together at Nice in May 1538. The Truce of Nice, signed on 18 June, agreed to a ten-year halt in hostilities and left France in possession of most of Savoy, Piedmont and Artois.

===Italian War of 1542–1546===

The 1538 truce failed to resolve underlying tensions between Francis, who still claimed Milan, and Charles, who insisted he comply with the treaties of Madrid and Cambrai. Their relationship collapsed in 1540 when Charles made his son Philip Duke of Milan, thus precluding any possibility it would revert to France. In 1541, Charles made a disastrous attack on Ottoman port of Algiers, which severely weakened his military and led Suleiman to reactivate his French alliance. With Ottoman support, on 12 July 1542 Francis once again declared war on the Holy Roman Empire, initiating the Italian War of 1542–46.

In August, French armies attacked Perpignan on the Spanish border, as well as Artois, Flanders and Luxemburg, a Valois possession prior to 1477. Imperial resistance proved far more formidable than expected, with most of these attacks easily repulsed and in 1543 Henry VIII allied with Charles and agreed to support his offensive in Flanders. Neither side made much progress, and although a combined Franco-Ottoman fleet under Hayreddin Barbarossa captured Nice on 22 August and besieged the citadel, the onset of winter and presence of a Spanish fleet forced them to withdraw. A joint attack by Christian and Islamic troops on a Christian town was regarded as shocking, especially when Francis allowed Barbarossa to use the French port of Toulon as a winter base.

On 14 April 1544, a French army commanded by Francis, Count of Enghien, defeated the Imperials at Ceresole, a victory of limited strategic value since they failed to make progress elsewhere in Lombardy. The Imperial position was further strengthened at Serravalle in June, when Alfonso d&#x27;Avalos defeated a mercenary force led by the Florentine exile Piero Strozzi on their way to meet Enghien. An English army captured Boulogne on 10 September, while Imperial forces advanced to within of Paris. However, with his treasury exhausted and concerned by Ottoman naval strength in the Mediterranean Sea, on 14 September Charles agreed the Treaty of Crépy with Francis, which essentially restored the position to that prevailing in 1542. The agreement excluded Henry VIII, whose war with France continued until the two countries made peace in 1546 and confirmed his possession of Boulogne.

===Italian War of 1551–1559===

Francis died on 31 March 1547 and was succeeded by his son, Henry II of France. He continued attempts to restore the French position in Italy, encouraged by Italian exiles and his cousin Francis, Duke of Guise, who claimed the throne of Naples through his grandfather René II, Duke of Lorraine. Henry first strengthened his diplomatic position by reactivating the Franco-Ottoman alliance and supporting their capture of Tripoli in August 1551. Despite his devout personal Catholicism and persecution of Huguenot &quot;heretics&quot; at home, in January 1552 he signed the Treaty of Chambord with several Protestant princes within the Empire, which gave him control of the Three Bishoprics of Toul, Verdun, and Metz.

Following the outbreak of the Second Schmalkaldic War in March 1552, French troops occupied the Three Bishoprics and invaded Lorraine. In 1553, a Franco-Ottoman force captured the Genoese island of Corsica, while supported by Henry&#x27;s wife, Catherine de&#x27; Medici, French-backed Tuscan exiles seized control of Siena. This brought Henry into conflict with the ruler of Florence, Cosimo de&#x27; Medici, who defeated a French army at Marciano on 2 August 1554; although Siena held out until April 1555, it was absorbed by Florence and in 1569 became part of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany.

In July 1554, Philip II of Spain became king of England through his marriage to Mary I, and in November he also received the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily from his father, who reconfirmed him as Duke of Milan. In January 1556, Charles formally abdicated as Emperor and split his possessions; the Holy Roman Empire went to his brother Ferdinand I, while Spain, its overseas territories and the Spanish Netherlands were assigned to Philip. Over the next century, Naples and Lombardy became a major source of men and money for the Spanish Army of Flanders during the 1568 to 1648 Eighty Years&#x27; War.

England entered the war in June 1557 and the focus shifted to Flanders, where a Spanish army defeated the French at St. Quentin on 10 August. Despite this, in January 1558 the French took Calais; held by the English since 1347, its loss severely diminished their future ability to intervene directly in mainland Europe. They also captured Thionville in June but peace negotiations had already begun, with Henry absorbed by the internal conflict that led to the French Wars of Religion in 1562. The Treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis on 3 April 1559 brought the Italian wars to an end. Corsica was returned to Genoa, while Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy, re-established the Savoyard state in northern Italy as an independent entity. France retained Calais and the Three Bishoprics, while other provisions essentially returned the position to that prevailing in 1551. Finally, Henry II and Philip II agreed to ask Pope Pius IV to recognise Ferdinand as Emperor, and reconvene the Council of Trent.

==Aftermath==
===Results===
The European balance of power changed significantly during the Italian Wars. The affirmation of French power in Italy around 1494 brought Austria and Spain to join an anti-French league that formed the &quot;Habsburg ring&quot; around France (Low Countries, Aragon, Castile, Empire) via dynastic marriages that eventually led to the large inheritance of Charles V. On the other hand, the last Italian war ended with the division of the Habsburg empire between the Spanish and Austrian Habsburgs following the abdication of Charles V. Philip II of Spain was heir of the kingdoms held by Charles V in Spain, southern Italy, and South America. Ferdinand I was the successor of Charles V in the Holy Roman Empire extending from Germany to northern Italy and became &quot;suo jure&quot; king of the Habsburg monarchy. The Habsburg Netherlands and the Duchy of Milan were left in personal union to the king of Spain while continuing to be part of the Holy Roman Empire.

The division of the Empire of Charles V, along with the capture of the Pale of Calais and the Three Bishoprics, was a positive result for France. However, the Habsburgs had gained a position of primacy in Italy at the expense of the French Valois. In return, France was forced to end opposition to Habsburg power and abandon its claims in Italy. Henry II also restored the Savoyard state to Emmanuel Philibert, who settled in Piedmont, and Corsica to the Republic of Genoa. For this reason, the conclusion of the Italian Wars for France is considered to be a mixed result.

At the end of the wars, about half of Italy was ruled by the Spanish Habsburgs, including all of the south (Naples, Sicily, Sardinia) and the Duchy of Milan; the other half of Italy remained independent (although the north was largely formed by formal fiefs of the Austrian Habsburgs as part of the Holy Roman Empire). The most significant Italian power left was the papacy in central Italy, as it maintained major cultural and political influence during the Catholic Reformation. The Council of Trent, suspended during the war, was reconvened by the terms of the peace treaties and came to an end in 1563.

===Interpretations===

As in the case of France, the Habsburg result is also variously interpreted. Many historians in the 20th century, including Garrett Mattingly, Eric Cochrane and Manuel F. Alvarez, identified the Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis as the beginning of a Spanish hegemony in Italy. However, this view has been contested and abandoned in 21st-century historiography. Christine Shaw, Micheal J. Levin, and William Reger reject the concept of a Spanish hegemony on the ground that too many limits prevented Spain&#x27;s dominance in the peninsula, and maintain that other powers also held major influence in Italy after 1559. Although Spain gained control of about half of the Italian states, the other half remained independent; among them, the Papacy in particular emerged strengthened by the conclusion of the Council of Trent according to the scholars Antelantonio Spagnoletti and Benedetto Croce. Furthermore, according to the historians Christine Shaw and Salvatore Puglisi, the Holy Roman Empire continued to play a role in Italian politics. Peter J. Wilson writes that three overlapping and competing feudal networks, Imperial, Spanish, and Papal, were affirmed in Italy as a result of the end of the wars.

In the long-term, Habsburg primacy in Italy continued to exist, but it varied significantly due to the change of dynasties in Austria and Spain. Following the War of the Spanish Succession and other wars of succession, the Habsburg-Lorraine of Austria largely replaced Spain and gained direct or indirect control of the fiefs of Imperial Italy, whereas the south eventually passed to an independent branch of the Spanish Bourbons. France would return in Italy to confront Habsburg power, first under Louis XIV, and later under Napoleon, but only the unification of Italy would permanently remove foreign powers from the peninsula.

Charles Tilly has characterized the Italian Wars as a key part in his theory of state formation, as the wars demonstrated the value of large armies and superior military technology. In &quot;Coercion, Capital, and European States, AD 990–1992&quot;, Tilly argues that a &quot;comprehensive European state system&quot; can be reasonably dated to the Italian Wars.

==Military==
The Italian Wars represented a revolution in military technology and tactics, some historians suggesting they form the dividing point between modern and medieval battlefields. Contemporary historian Francesco Guicciardini wrote of the initial 1494 French invasion that &quot;...sudden and violent wars broke out, ending with the conquest of a state in less time than it used to take to occupy a villa. The siege and taking of a city became extremely rapid and achieved not in months but in days and hours&quot;.

Infantry underwent profound developments during the Italian Wars, evolving from a primary pike- and halberd-wielding force to a more flexible arrangement of arquebusiers, pikemen, and other troops. While landsknechts and Swiss mercenaries continued to dominate during the early part of the wars, the Italian War of 1521 demonstrated the power of massed firearms in pike and shot formations.

A 1503 skirmish between French and Spanish forces first demonstrated the utility of arquebuses in battle. The Spanish general, Gonzalo de Córdoba, faked a retreat, luring a contingent of French men-at-arms between two groups of his arquebusiers. As the French army stepped between the marksmen, volleys of bullets battered them on both flanks. Before the French could attack the vulnerable arquebusiers, a Spanish cavalry charge broke the French forces and forced their retreat. While the French army escaped, the Spanish inflicted severe casualties.

So successful was the employment of firearms in the Italian Wars that Niccolò Machiavelli, often characterized as an enemy of the use of the arquebus, wrote in his treatise on &quot;The Art of War&quot; that all citizens in a city should know how to fire a gun.

===Veterans turned conquistadors===
Many &quot;conquistadors&quot;, such as Hernán Cortés, had considered Italy before opting to serve in Spanish America, while large numbers of veterans from Naples and southern Italy later emigrated there, either as colonists or soldiers. Experience in Italy was often considered a prerequisite for military employment, although the chronicler Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés claimed those who did so must have &quot;failed to become rich...gambled the riches away or [somehow] lost them&quot; and suggested conditions in the Americas were far tougher. Francisco Sebastián, an Italian veteran who accompanied Hernando de Soto on his expedition into North America, agreed with this assessment, largely because &quot;no plunder of value could be obtained&quot; from the inhabitants.

Italian veterans included Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar, who conquered Cuba in 1511, Francisco de Carvajal and Pedro de Valdivia, both of whom fought at Pavia in 1526. Carvajal and Valdivia served with the Pizarro brothers in Peru during their conflict with Spanish rival Diego de Almagro in 1538. Carvajal remained with the Pizarros while Valdivia began the conquest of Chile and ignited the Arauco War. The two men fought on opposite sides in the 1548 Battle of Jaquijahuana; Carvajal was executed after being taken prisoner, while Valdivia died in 1553 at Tucapel.

===Cavalry===
Heavy cavalry, the final evolution of the fully armoured medieval knight, remained significant players on the battlefields of the Italian Wars. Largely due to their excellent horses, French gendarmes were generally successful against heavy mounted troops from other states, but were very vulnerable to pikemen. The Spanish used heavy cavalry and light cavalry, or &quot;Jinetes&quot;, for skirmishing.

===Artillery===
Artillery, particularly field artillery, became an indispensable part of any first-rate army during the wars. When Charles VIII invaded in 1494, he brought with him the first truly mobile siege train of culverins and bombards. It included various innovations, such as mounting the guns on wheeled carriages, drawn by horses rather than oxen as was the custom, which allowed them to be deployed against an enemy stronghold on arrival. This mobility stemmed from their lightness, achieved by employing the methods used to cast bronze church bells. Perhaps the most important improvement was the creation of the iron cannonball, rather than the stone balls that often shattered on impact. The combination meant Charles could level in an hour castles that had resisted sieges for months or even years.

== Historiography ==
The Italian Wars are one of the first major conflicts for which extensive contemporary accounts from people involved in the wars are available, owing largely to the presence of literate, and often extremely-well educated, commanders. The invention of modern printing, still less than one century old, undoubtedly played a large role in the memorialization of the conflict as well. Major historians of the period include Francesco Guicciardini and Paolo Sarpi.

=== Nomenclature ===
The naming of the component conflicts within the Italian Wars has never been standardized and varies among historians of the period. Some wars may be split or combined differently, causing ordinal numbering systems to be inconsistent among different sources. The wars may be referred to by their dates or by the monarchs fighting them. Usually, the Italian Wars are grouped into three major phases: 1494–1516; 1521–1530; and 1535–1559.

=== Contemporary accounts ===
A major contemporary account for the early portion of the Italian Wars is Francesco Guicciardini&#x27;s &quot;Storia d&#x27;Italia&quot; (&quot;History of Italy&quot;), written during the conflict and advantaged by the access that Guicciardini had to papal affairs.

<text>Lindau (, &quot;Lindau am Bodensee&quot;; ; Low Alemannic: &quot;Lindou&quot;) is a major town and island on the eastern side of Lake Constance (&quot;Bodensee&quot; in German) in Bavaria, Germany. It is the capital of the county (&quot;Landkreis&quot;) of Lindau, Bavaria and is near the borders of the Austrian state of Vorarlberg, and the Swiss cantons of St. Gallen and Thurgau. The coat of arms of Lindau town is a linden tree, referring to the supposed origin of the town&#x27;s name. The historic town of Lindau is located on the island of the same name, which is connected with the mainland by a road bridge and a railway causeway leading to Lindau station.

Lindau is located near the meeting point of the Austrian, German, and Swiss borders and is nestled on the lake in front of Austria&#x27;s Pfänder mountain. Lindau is popular with sightseers and vacationers for its medieval town centre and picturesque location on Lake Constance.

== History ==
The first use of the name Lindau was documented in 882 by a monk from St. Gallen, stating that Adalbert (count of Raetia) had founded a nunnery on the island. However, the remains of an early Roman settlement dating back to the 1st century were found in the district of Aeschach.

In 1180, St. Stephan&#x27;s church was founded. In 1224, the Franciscans founded a monastery on the island. In 1274–75, Lindau became an Imperial Free City under King Rudolf I.

In 1430, about 15 of Lindau&#x27;s Jews were burned at the stake after being accused of murdering a Christian child. In 1528, Lindau accepted the Protestant Reformation, following the Tetrapolitan Confession at first and subsequently the Augsburg Confession. In 1655, after the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the first &quot;Lindauer Kinderfest&quot; (children&#x27;s festival) was held, in memory of the war. This festival, introduced by Councillor Valentin Heider, still makes up an important part of the town&#x27;s identity.

Lindau lost its status as an Imperial Free City in 1802, after the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire. The city went to Karl August von Bretzenheim, a son of the Elector of Bavaria Charles Theodore, who gave Lindau and the monastery to the Austrian Empire in 1804. In 1805, Austria returned Lindau to Bavaria.

In 1853, a causeway was built to connect the railway from Munich to the island. In 1856, a new harbour was built, with its characteristic landmarks, the big lion sculpture and Bavaria&#x27;s only lighthouse.

In 1922, the independent districts of Aeschach, Hoyren and Reutin merged with the Lindau district. After World War II, Lindau fell under French military administration and went first to Württemberg-Hohenzollern and then to the State of Baden-Württemberg. In 1955, Lindau again returned to Bavaria.

The Nobel Laureate Meetings at Lindau began in 1951 and bring many Nobel Prize laureates to Lindau each year.

== Tourist attractions ==

== Economy ==

Historically, the trading route from Nuremberg to Italy passed through Lindau; fishery has also played a big role in the economy of the city, and in the 19th century, Lindau was an important location for textile industries. Tourism (including restaurants and accommodation) and industrial production are the main industries in contemporary Lindau.

The A96 links to the Austrian Autobahn A14 starting right after joining with the 7 km long Pfändertunnel. The tunnel was expanded into a 4-lane, 2-tunnel road that was opened in 2013 to accommodate increased north–south traffic.

===Airports===
Lindau does not have its own airport. However, it is close to Friedrichshafen Airport and Memmingen Airport, which usually serve tourist arrivals and European destinations. The nearest major airports are Munich Airport, Stuttgart Airport, or Zurich Airport.

== Utilities ==
Lindau&#x27;s local utility provider is called Stadtwerke Lindau, which provides electricity, water, telecommunications, public baths, and some other services to Lindau.

==Telecommunications==
The local utility provider Stadtwerke TK-Lindau started deploying fibre-optic internet to major businesses and new housing development areas. Other networks include cable television by Kabel Deutschland, which is available in some streets and xDSL, by many providers. Some systems have seen upgrades of the ADSL standard in the last years to cope with the high bandwidth demand. There are plans to deploy a WiFi hotspot network (or WLAN, as it is more commonly known in German) across the Island of Lindau.

==Property, redevelopment, and other major projects==
Lindau is currently planning several redevelopment projects across the city. The following is a list of projects that are planned for redevelopment.
* New train station – Lindau has been planning a new train station for many years. Currently there is agreement between the major stakeholders to build a new station near the shopping mall Lindaupark (Reutin district) and refurbish the station on the island. Both stations will remain active. 
*Electrification of the train tracks to Munich (connecting Munich and Zurich) – this major project is sponsored by large external stakeholders such as the State of Bavaria, Switzerland, and .
*Lindau Inselhalle – Lindau&#x27;s main hall, which is used for conferences is due to be rebuilt soon.
*Multi-storey car park – related to the redevelopment of Lindau Inselhalle on the island
* Property developments near the train station on the island are planned, after rail tracks have been removed
* A new fire station was completed in September 2014 near Auenstraße (outside the island) – a major headquarters for all the former stations across town, including the Technisches Hilfswerk (THW) unit of Lindau.
*Property developments connected to the area that belongs to near Reutin, once the new train station is completed
*Property developments in Aeschach district – including some major buildings, including luxury apartments and offices
*Railway underpass near the entrance of the island – Lindau is planning two railway underpasses for cars to ease congestion, partly caused by tourists visiting by car, causing frequent crossing closures
*Several company extensions or relocations are planned – as of September 2014, Continental AG is extending into a third office complex
*Lindau Utility is deploying optical broadband across the city
*Lindau Strandbad, the major public bath, is in discussion of being refurbished

== Local news sources ==
Lindau has a well established newspaper called Lindauer Zeitung, which is part of the Schwäbische Zeitung, which is released daily. Another newspaper is the Bürgerzeitung Lindau (BZ), which is published by the city council. It is released biweekly and contains announcements for the town by the mayor and local news. The paper is free, sponsored by advertisements, and can usually be found in shops. Both newspapers are available in print and online.

== Schools and kindergartens ==
Lindau has two main high schools: Bodensee-Gymnasium and Valentin-Heider-Gymnasium. With one middle school for girls (Maria-Ward-Realschule Lindau) and one middle school for boys (Staatliche Realschule für Knaben Lindau), there are several primary schools across the town. Lindau recently completed construction of a new Kindergarten, which also included a Kita Kindertagestätte, which is a baby nursery for children aged 2–3. There is high demand for childcare in Lindau and providers are obliged by the State of Bavaria to provide for every child.

Lindau&#x27;s main shopping mall is called Lindaupark and hosts larger shops such as Müller Drogerie and a supermarket.

== Festivals and events ==
Thanks to its location on Lake Constance, Lindau hosts a number of festivals and events, usually in summer (between May and August). 
* U&amp;D, Umsonst &amp; Draussen by Club Vaudeville Lindau. The festival hosts live music in a public area.

== Genealogy ==
Lindau is believed to be the origin of the Lindauer surname of Germany, Switzerland, Alsace-Lorraine, Austria and the Czech Republic. A Jewish family bearing this name is said to have descended from Suskind of Lindau, who was among those killed during the pogrom of 1430.

Lindauer is also the name of a famous wine brand from New Zealand. However, there is no established relationship between Lindau and the wine, which is named after painter Gottfried Lindauer.

==Gastronomy==

Lindau produces a number of local wines and beverages. There are a number of localities that produce wines (Rädlewirtschaften) from local vineyards and Schnapps made by local farmers.

== Climate ==

Lindau is located in a temperate climatic zone (experiencing four distinct seasons) with mountain surroundings and the freshwater lake. Winters can be cold, with temperatures reaching as low as −20 °C on occasion. In some exceptional cases, winters can be so severely cold that major parts of the lake freeze, making crossing of the lake by car possible, however this is a once in 50- to 100-year event. Summers are normally warm to hot and usually humid due to the surrounding lake.

Heavy storms, rain showers, and thunderstorms are common in summer and heavy winds up to 8 on the Beaufort scale are possible. Usually, the lake is calm; however, there is a warning-light system for boats to indicate if heavy storms are forecast. Due to the surrounding mountains, snow is always in sight and a good indicator of weather. Lake Constance is located at roughly 400m meters above sea level.

==Twin towns==
Lindau is twinned with:
* Serpukhov (Russia)
* Chelles (France) Lindau was twinned in 1964 with the City of Chelles in France, which was initiated by the returned French soldiers after World War II.
* Reitnau (Switzerland)

<text>The American Anthropological Association (AAA) is an American organization of scholars and practitioners in the field of anthropology. With 10,000 members, the association, based in Arlington, Virginia, includes archaeologists, cultural anthropologists, biological (or physical) anthropologists, linguistic anthropologists, linguists, medical anthropologists and applied anthropologists in universities and colleges, research institutions, government agencies, museums, corporations and non-profits throughout the world. The AAA publishes more than 20 peer-reviewed scholarly journals, available in print and online through AnthroSource. The AAA was founded in 1902.

==History==
The first anthropological society in the US was the American Ethnological Society of New York, which was founded by Albert Gallatin and revived in 1899 by Franz Boas after a hiatus. 1879 saw the establishment of the Anthropological Society of Washington (which first published the journal &quot;American Anthropologist&quot;, before it became a national journal), and 1882 saw the American Association for the Advancement of Science established an anthropological section. Boas and other anthropologist discussed the possibility of creating a single national society already in 1898, but fears that it might damage the AAAS caused a long discussion. In 1901 the AES and ASW sent members to attend the meeting of the AAAS anthropologists in Chicago in which discussions continued and there was general agreement that a national society should be formed. Boas advocated a restricted membership of 40 &quot;professional anthropologists&quot;, but the AAA&#x27;s first president, W. J. McGee, ensured that membership would be open to everyone with an interest in the discipline. At its incorporation, it assumed responsibility for the journal&quot; American Anthropologist&quot;, created in 1888 by the Anthropological Society of Washington (ASW).

Business affairs are conducted by a 41-member Section Assembly representing each of the association&#x27;s constituent sections, and a 15-member Executive Board.

According to its articles of incorporation, the AAA was formed to:

promote the science of anthropology, to stimulate and coordinate the efforts of American anthropologists, to foster local and other societies devoted to anthropology, to serve as a bond among American anthropologists and anthropologic[al] organizations present and prospective, and to publish and encourage the publication of matter pertaining to anthropology.
From an initial membership of 175, the AAA grew slowly during the first half of the 20th century. Annual meetings were held primarily in the Northeast and accommodated all attendees in a single room.

The Association describes itself as &quot;a democratic organization since its beginning.&quot;

In 2010, AAA Executive Board stripped the word &quot;science&quot; from a draft statement of its long-range plan, instead pledging to advance &quot;the public understanding of humankind.&quot; The change set off a wide-ranging controversy over the definition of the discipline, with many archaeologists and physical anthropologists describing themselves as marginalized within the AAA. The final version of the long-range plan begins, &quot;The strength of Anthropology lies in its distinctive position at the nexus of the sciences and humanities&quot; and declares, &quot;The purpose of the Association shall be to advance scholarly understanding of humankind in all its aspects ... drawing from and building upon knowledge from biological and physical sciences as well as the humanities and social sciences.&quot;

The offices of the AAA are located in Arlington, Virginia.

==Sections==
The AAA is composed of 40 sections, which are groups organized around identity affiliations or intellectual interests within the discipline of anthropology. Sections each have an elected president or chair; many publish journals and host meetings.

==Publications==
The AAA publishes more than 20 section publications including &quot;American Anthropologist&quot;, &quot;American Ethnologist&quot;, &quot;Cultural Anthropology&quot;, &quot;Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly&quot; and &quot;Medical Anthropology Quarterly&quot;. The AAA&#x27;s official magazine, &quot;Anthropology News&quot;, is published bimonthly. AAA publications are available online through AnthroSource. Since 2007, journals have been published in partnership with Wiley-Blackwell since 2007. Since 1962 the association has published the AAA AnthroGuide, giving staff and program information about anthropology departments.

==Public issues involvement==
The AAA supported the passage of the Antiquities Act of 1906, protested the discontinuance of anthropological research in the Philippines (1915), urged the teaching of anthropology in high schools (1927), spoke out for the preservation of archaeological materials when dams were built by the Tennessee Valley Authority (1935), passed a pre-WWII resolution against racism (1938), and expressed the need to &quot;guard against the dangers, and utilize the promise, inherent in the use of atomic energy&quot; (1945).

In the 1960s and early 1970s, the association examined the issues of government-sponsored classified research, use of anthropologists by the military in Vietnam, secret research in Thailand, and the general problem of a code of ethics for anthropological research, particularly for the protection of the rights of those studied. Other issues addressed from the 1970s through the 1980s included illegal antiquities trade, the insertion of religious beliefs into social science texts, the preservation of endangered nonhuman primates, and the religious significance of peyote to Native Americans.

In 2004, in response to President George W. Bush&#x27;s call for a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, the Association issued a statement on marriage and the family. It states:

The Association also has adopted resolutions against the 2003 invasion of Iraq, against the use of anthropological knowledge as an element for physical or psychological torture, and against any covert or overt U.S. military action against Iran. Following a referendum in 2023, the Association endorsed a boycott of Israeli academic institutions, joining the BDS movement.

A number of ideologically polarized debates within the discipline of anthropology have prompted the association to conduct investigations. These include the dispute between Derek Freeman and defenders of Margaret Mead, as well as the controversy over the book &quot;Darkness in El Dorado&quot;. In the latter case, Alice Dreger, an historian of medicine and science, and an outsider to the debate, concluded after a year of research that the American Anthropological Association was complicit and irresponsible in helping spread the falsehoods contained in the book, and not protecting &quot;scholars from baseless and sensationalistic charges&quot;.

===Race===
The AAA has issued a number of statements on the topic of race, and since the 1950s has argued publicly that race is best understood as a cultural or bio-cultural rather than mostly biological construction.

In the 1990s, in response to what it felt was public confusion about the meaning of &quot;race,&quot; particularly perceived public misconceptions about race and intelligence, the AAA Executive Board commissioned the &quot;American Anthropological Association Statement on Race,&quot; and said that race is a constructed social mechanism &quot;...&quot;race&quot; as it is understood in the United States of America was a social mechanism invented...&quot; The statement clarified: &quot;With the vast expansion of scientific knowledge in this century, however, it has become clear that human populations are not unambiguous, clearly demarcated, biologically distinct groups.&quot;

In 2006, the association developed and continues to manage a public education program titled &quot;RACE: Are We So Different?&quot; The program includes a traveling museum exhibit, an interactive website, and educational materials.

===Human rights===
Initially, AAA was highly skeptical of the concept of universal human rights, with some anthropologists arguing that because of cultural relativism there are no principles that can be universally valid for humans of all cultures. IN 1947 the AAA issued a statement on Human rights, noting that value judgments are culturally contextual and arguing that a declaration about universal human rights ought to take into consideration and encompass all the different human value systems. This stance has gradually been abandoned by most anthropologists, many of whom today see universal human rights as an important way through which discrimination, oppression of cultural minorities can be reduced.

===Immigration policy===

====Arizona====
On May 22, 2010, the AAA Executive Board issued a resolution that declared Arizona&#x27;s SB1070, a law which empowers state law enforcement to assist with the enforcement of federal law, to be &quot;unconstitutional.&quot; The Board claimed it would boycott Arizona, but would not boycott &quot;Indian Reservations&quot; within the state, until the law &quot;is either repealed or struck down as constitutionally invalid.&quot; The Board did not state what it will do if the courts uphold SB1070 as constitutionally valid.

The Board stated that &quot;The AAA has a long and rich history of supporting policies that prohibit discrimination based on ... national origin...&quot;

On September 19, 2016, the U.S. District Court in Arizona entered a permanent injunction barring enforcement of the remaining provisions. With the law&#x27;s repeal, AAA&#x27;s ban on considering AAA conferences in Arizona was lifted.

===Engaging with the military===

====Vietnam War====
In March 1967, during the Vietnam War, the Council of the AAA adopted a &quot;Statement on Problems of Anthropological Research and Ethics&quot; that stated:

====Human Terrain System====
Through 2007 and 2008, debates surrounding anthropologists and the military resurfaced in response to the Pentagon&#x27;s Human Terrain System (HTS) project. Following a number of national news articles on the project, anthropologists began to debate the project and related ethical issues. Proponents of the program argued that anthropologists were providing much-needed cultural knowledge about local populations and helping to decrease violence in their areas of operation. Critics, however, argued that HTS anthropologists could not receive informed consent from their research subjects in a war zone and that information provided by anthropologists might put populations in danger.

To address these issues, the Association&#x27;s Executive Board released a statement on 31 October 2007. It cited &quot;sufficiently troubling and urgent ethical issues&quot; raised by the project, including the difficulties for HTS anthropologists to receive informed consent without coercion from their research subjects and to uphold their ethical mandate to &quot;do no harm&quot; to those they study. The AAA urged members to adhere to its code of ethics, which outlines principles and guidelines for ethical behavior. However, the association does not adjudicate cases involving charges of unethical behavior or bar members from participating in the HTS program.

In addition, the Association&#x27;s Commission on the Engagement of Anthropology with US Security and Intelligence Communities (CEAUSSIC) issued a final report released during the AAA&#x27;s 2007 annual meeting, based on over a year of work. It neither endorsed nor condemned anthropological work with military, intelligence and security organizations, but instead outlined the opportunities and challenges of working in these sectors. Opposition to military cooperation was evident during that meeting. Some critics of the HTS program have suggested that scholars who perform classified work with the military be expelled from the organization. During an event organized by the Network of Concerned Anthropologists, a graduate student who had recently been expelled from the HTS program spoke out about her experiences. She argued that the program was poorly run but was doing positive work in helping military officers with &quot;nation-building&quot; activities.

==AnthroSource==

&quot;AnthroSource&quot; is the online repository of the journals of the American Anthropological Association. Launched in 2004, it contains current issues for fifteen of the Association&#x27;s peer-reviewed publications, as well as an archive of the journals, newsletters, and bulletins published by the Association and its member sections. Members of the association receive access to AnthroSource as a benefit of membership, and institutions may receive access via paid subscription.

Until August 2007, AnthroSource was a collaboration between the University of California Press and the Association. It, along with all their journals, has since been removed from the University of California Press by the AAA Board and transferred to Wiley-Blackwell. Commencing 2008, AnthroSource was to be hosted and managed by Wiley-Blackwell as part of the five-year publishing contract awarded.

In 2013, the Association announced that it would experiment with making &quot;Cultural Anthropology&quot; an open-access journal; Brad Weiss, the society&#x27;s president, said in a statement posted on the group&#x27;s Web site, that &quot;Starting with the first issue of 2014, CA will provide worldwide, instant, free (to the user), and permanent access to all of our content (as well as 10 years of our back catalog),&quot; and that &quot;Cultural Anthropology will be the first major, established, high-impact journal in anthropology to offer open access to all of its research&quot;

<text>Blackrock () is an affluent suburb of Dublin, Ireland, northwest of Dún Laoghaire. It is named after the local geological rock formation to be found in the area of Blackrock Park. In the late 18th century, the Blackrock Road was a common place for highway robberies. The Blackrock baths, provided for by the railway company in 1839, became popular in the 19th century but Blackrock is now a tourist destination.

==History==

===Origin of the name===
Blackrock, some hundreds of years ago, was variously called Newtown-at-the Black Rock, Newtown on the Strand by the Black Rock, Newtown Castle Byrne, or simply Newtown, so that &quot;Blackrock&quot; is simply an abbreviation of one of its ancient titles. For example, the town was called Newtown in a 1488 Act of Parliament. The name still survives in Newtown Avenue, and Newtown House. It was thus distinguished from Newtown-in-the-Deer-Park, as the village of Newtown Park was then called, from the circumstance that it was built in the Deer Park belonging to Stillorgan House, or Castle (&quot;a quo&quot; Newtownpark Avenue).

Blackrock is named after the local geological rock formation to be found in the area of Blackrock Park. Most of it is now buried under the park, but it is said that it is possible to see it just north of the pond. The rock itself is a limestone calp that when wet appears black, thus giving the name Black Rock. For the construction of the railway in 1834, the rock was extensively used for the wall cappings between Williamstown and Blackrock and can also be seen in the walls of the train station at Blackrock. St Mary&#x27;s Chapel of Ease on St. Mary&#x27;s Place, nicknamed the Black Church, is constructed using the same Black Rock (limestone calp), although the rock used in its construction is locally sourced to the church.

===The Rock Road===

The Rock Road, which forms the south-western boundary of the park, is said to form part of one of the oldest roads in the country, having been part of the ancient constructed by the High King of Ireland several centuries before Saint Patrick, and which connected Tara with what is now southern County Dublin and north-east County Wicklow. The road may have facilitated the O&#x27;Toole and the O&#x27;Byrne clans in their raids on the neighbourhood of Dublin.

In 1787, the Blackrock Road was such a common place for highway robberies that, in an attempt to put an end to these crimes, a local meeting was held at Jennett&#x27;s Tavern in Blackrock which was chaired by the 4th Viscount Ranelagh. The meeting concluded when one of the outcomes was &quot;Resolved, That we will give a reward of £20 to any person who will apprehend and prosecute to conviction any person guilty of a robbery upon the Blackrock-road, from Dublin to Dunleary, Bullock, Dalkey, Rochestown, Cabinteely, and Loughlinstown&quot;. In 1826, Rev. George Wogan, the curate of Donnybrook, was murdered in his house in Spafield Place near Ballsbridge. Later on the evening of his murder, two bandits were apprehended for a highway robbery on the Blackrock Road and confessed to the murder, and were hanged. This illustrates the danger faced by travellers of the Blackrock road at certain times in the past.

===Historic houses===

Many fine houses of historical and architectural significance were built in the area, some of which are still existing today, while others have been demolished.

Frescati House, built in 1739, was a fine example and was at one time the childhood home of Lord Edward FitzGerald. Frescati, despite much local protest to save it, was demolished in 1983 and Frascati Shopping Centre now stands in its place.

Maretimo House was built in 1770 as a summer residence for Nicholas Lawless, 1st Baron Cloncurry, who had his main house at Lyons Hill, County Kildare. His son Valentine Lawless, 2nd Baron Cloncurry gave land beside the house for the building of the Roman Catholic Church, St. John the Baptist. At the time of the construction of the Dublin and Kingstown Railway, Lord Cloncurry was compensated with, among other things, a private railway bridge and harbour. Maretimo house was demolished in 1970 and apartments of the same name now stand in its place. The private railway bridge can still be seen today but is not maintained and its once elegant walkway has been replaced by a corrugated iron walkway.

Blackrock House, built in 1774 by Sir John Lees (1737–1811), is one of a few 18th-century houses built with red brick. It has some fine features such as a two-storey red brick porch. It also features a large coach-house, stable yard and gate lodge. With the construction of the railway, Lees was also compensated with a tunnel being built through his land. There is a ruin of a small summer house near Lord Cloncurry&#x27;s harbour. In the nineteenth century, it was owned by the Vance family. The house is still here to be seen today, although it is currently divided into flats.

Rosefield (previously Belleville) was demolished in 1983 to make way for the Blackrock Clinic. Rosefield was one of the first seaside villas built on the Fitzwilliam estate around 1750.

Talbot Lodge was an 18th-century villa that was later doubled in size. It was bought by the Sisters of Charity and became part of the Linden Convalescent Home. It was sold to developers and was demolished in December 1989.

Neptune House, built in 1767, is a Georgian building with a colourful history. It was the country residence of John Scott, the first Earl of Clonmel, who was chief justice of the King&#x27;s Bench in 1784. He was also known as &#x27;Copper-faced Jack&#x27; for his aggressiveness in argument and skin tone. In 1916, British troops who landed in Dún Laoghaire during the Easter Rising stayed in Neptune House.

===Religion in history===

The Church of Ireland built two churches in the area. The Booterstown parish was established in 1821 from the Donnybrook parish and the first church built was St. Philip and St. James Church in 1822 on Cross Avenue. To follow was All Saints Church on Carysfort Avenue in 1868.

The Catholic Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul founded St. Catherine&#x27;s Seminary in 1939 with the purchase of the house Dunardagh, Temple Hill.

The Catholic Dominican Order came to Blackrock in the 1830s with the purchase of the house Sion Hill on the corner of Mount Merrion Avenue and Cross Avenue. They set up Sion Hill Convent, a girls&#x27; school called Dominican College Sion Hill, and Froebel College of Education. They also run an Adult Education Centre and they ran St. Catherine&#x27;s College of Education for Home Economics between 1929 and 2007.

The Catholic Holy Ghost Fathers came to Blackrock from Paris and established Blackrock College in 1860 with the purchase of Castle Dawson. They later bought Williamstown Castle in 1875, Clareville in 1899 and Willow Park in 1924. All of these buildings, except Clareville, are still standing today and form Blackrock College and Willow Park School.

The Kellyite sect was formed by Rev. Thomas Kelly (1769–1855), who broke away from the Church of Ireland. He built a church called Christchurch on Carysfort Avenue. In 1872 the church was handed over to the Church of Ireland. In the early 1960s, the church was demolished as it was surplus to needs. The old church was located where the car park is on the corner of Carysfort Avenue and the Blackrock Bypass.

The Methodist congregation established a church on George&#x27;s Avenue in the 19th century. The church is still standing but disused. The congregation moved to a new church beside Blackrock Town Hall on Newtown Avenue. The congregation consolidated with that of Dún Laoghaire around the middle of the 20th century. Since then the Blackrock building is used as a community meeting place called Urban Junction.

The Catholic Order of St. Camillus have a community residing at South Hill Avenue while Opus Dei established Rosemont secondary school off Temple Hill around 1970.

The Presbyterian Church in Ireland established their Blackrock Congregation in 1895. It met in the Blackrock Town Hall until they built St. Andrew&#x27;s Church on Mount Merrion Avenue in 1899.

The Catholic Religious Sisters of Charity arrived in 1864 with the purchase of Linden and established Linden Convalescent Home. They later bought Talbot Lodge which became part of the convalescent home. The home was sold in the late 1990s to developers who built the Linden residential complex. More recently, in 2003, the congregation expanded Our Lady&#x27;s Hospice to Blackrock with the opening of The Venerable Louis and Zelie Martin Hospice.

The Roman Catholic parish of Blackrock was established from Booterstown in 1922. The first church in the area was built on Sweetman&#x27;s Avenue in 1823. In 1845 a much larger church, St. John the Baptist was constructed on Temple Hill. Another church was built in 1967 on Newtownpark Avenue called the Church of the Guardian Angels.

The Society of Friends (Quakers) have their Dublin burial grounds, Friends Burial Ground, at Temple Hill. Their meeting house is on Carrickbrennan Road, Monkstown.

==Local government==
The districts of Blackrock, Monkstown and Booterstown were joined to form a single township under the Blackrock Township Act 1863. Under the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898, this became an urban district in 1899. The urban district of Blackrock was abolished in 1930, with its area becoming part of the borough of Dún Laoghaire. The borough was abolished in 1994, on the establishment of the county of Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown. Blackrock is a local electoral area that elects six councillors to Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council.

==Features==
===Blackrock Town Hall, Library and Technical Institute===

The Blackrock Town Hall, Library and Technical Institute is a complex of buildings in Main Street. Blackrock Town Hall was completed in 1865 while the Carnegie Library and the Technical Institute were built in 1905. The site for the Technical Institute was presented to the Town Commissioners by a resident, William Field MP, in 1898.

===Blackrock Park===

Blackrock had a beach that was a popular bathing place until the construction of the railway close to the shoreline. The space between the shore and the railway created an area that flooded with seawater at high tide. This created a malodorous salty marsh similar to that at Booterstown marsh. This marsh was a cause of local discomfort for years until it was decided by the Blackrock Town Commissioners (established in 1860) to fill the area in and create a park. The park, which stretches from Blackrock to Booterstown (encompassing Williamstown), was created in the early 1870s. The granite gates at the main entrance once belonged to a house called Vauxhall. The gardens at the entrance were part of the gardens of the old house.

The Williamstown Martello Tower in Blackrock Park was built between 1804 and 1806. When the tower was built, it would have been surrounded by seawater at high tide as it was built in the inter-tidal beach area. The tower became isolated from the sea when the construction of the railway took place, but seawater still flowed into the area at high tide. It wasn&#x27;t until the filling in of the area to form the Blackrock Park that the tower was to be on dry land. That part of the tower which is visible today is actually the first floor as the ground floor is buried underground.

In 2007, Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council published plans for the conservation and development of the park. The plans include the extensive redevelopment of the course of the Priory Stream, as well as the refurbishment of several of the buildings within the park. As of 2013, no work has been carried out as part of the redevelopment master plan, with no start date published.

===Blackrock Baths===

The Blackrock baths were provided for by the railway company in 1839 and were built beside the Blackrock train station. A special train ticket also permitted entrance to the baths. In 1887, the baths were rebuilt in concrete with a large gentlemen&#x27;s bath and a smaller ladies&#x27; bath. In 1928, the Urban District Council bought the baths for £2,000 and readied them for the Tailteann Games. The baths, with a 50-metre pool, were well known for their swimming galas and water polo and could accommodate up to 1,000 spectators.&quot;

Eddie Heron lived in Sandycove and is known for his achievement as 36 years undefeated Springboard and Highboard Diving Champion of Ireland. A plaque commemorating him is on the railway bridge that crosses over to the baths.

On 11 September 1891, Thomas Crean, while swimming with fellow students near Blackrock, helped rescue a 21-year-old art student named William Ahern. Crean noticed that Ahern was in trouble and together with a young solicitor named Leachman from Dundrum, he managed to bring him ashore. For his bravery, he was awarded a medal by the Royal Humane Society.

The decline in the use of the baths started in the 1960s when indoor heated swimming pools started to appear. Dún Laoghaire Corporation closed the Blackrock Baths in the late 1980s and by 1992, due to lack of maintenance, parts of the baths were dismantled. They have since been sold to developers Treasury Holdings. In 2013, the baths were demolished due to safety concerns following a routine inspection by Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council. It was found that the diving platform had been significantly corroded and detached from the pool base.

==Location and access==
Blackrock covers a large but not precisely defined area, rising from sea level on the coast to at White&#x27;s Cross on the N11 national primary road. Blackrock is bordered by Booterstown, Mount Merrion, Stillorgan, Foxrock, Deansgrange and Monkstown.

===Transport===
Blackrock has a station on the Dublin Area Rapid Transit (DART) line, which is 15 minutes away by train from the city centre. The DART runs on the same track that was built in 1834 for the Dublin and Kingstown Railway. Blackrock railway station, on both the DART and the mainline South Eastern Commuter railway line, opened on 17 December 1834 and is the oldest station in Ireland. Blackrock was formerly served by the Dublin tramways routes 6, 7 and 8 and was the terminus for the former. The tram lines ceased operations on 9 July 1949 and today the nearest tram is the Luas green line with stops at Sandyford and Stillorgan.

Bus services operated by Dublin Bus and Go-Ahead Ireland also serve the area with multiple bus routes. These are routes 4, 7/A/D, 17/C/D, 46E, 84/A, 114 and 7N. The Aircoach services to Dublin Airport from Dalkey and Greystones call at Blackrock en route to the airport.

The Blackrock bypass was built in the late 1980s and officially opened by Councillor Anne Brady on 24 March 1988. The bypass is part of the N31 which joins the harbour at Dún Laoghaire to the national Primary Route network.

==Commerce==
Blackrock is a major commercial centre, with cafes, restaurants, a wine and beer store, boutiques, hairdressers and barbers, a tattoo and piercing studio, pharmacies, supermarkets, art galleries, antiques and home improvements outlets as well as bars and banks.

Blackrock Shopping Centre was built in 1984 by Superquinn who managed the development and were the anchor store; Superquinn has since become part of Supervalu. Across the road is the area&#x27;s other shopping centre, Frascati. 

Blackrock Market was established in 1986 through 19A Main Street and houses over 30 independent stallholders. In addition, there are a number of foods stalls selling worldwide cuisines, cakes and ethnic food, there are a number of restaurants. The market is open Saturday, Sunday, and Bank Holidays from 11am-5:30pm, and many stalls and restaurants open during the week also.

Blackrock Clinic, a private clinic in Williamstown, was built on the site of Rosefield House.

===Enterprise and community===
The area has a range of industries, notably in the IT and service areas.

In April 2010, a new business organisation for the area was formed. It is known as the Blackrock Business Network (BBN). In Spring 2011, a new website was launched. and promotes over 400 businesses in the area. In 2016 they launched their first Leprechaun Chase, a hugely popular fun run event for the local community on Saint Patrick&#x27;s day followed by village entertainment - a Ceilí at the Cross and street performers.

== Demographics ==
The population of all electoral divisions labelled as Blackrock was 31,152 as of the 2022 census but this does include areas beyond what is usually defined as Blackrock.
