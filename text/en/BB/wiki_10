<text>Joachim Neander (165031 May 1680) was a German Reformed (Calvinist) Church teacher, theologian and hymnwriter whose most famous hymn, &quot;Praise to the Lord, the Almighty, the King of Creation&quot; () has been described by John Julian in his &quot;A Dictionary of Hymnology&quot; as &quot;a magnificent hymn of praise to God, perhaps the finest creation of its author, and of the first rank in its class.&quot; Due to its popularity it has been translated several times into English—Catherine Winkworth being one of the translators in the 19th century—and the hymn has appeared in most major hymnals.

Neander wrote about 60 hymns and provided tunes for many of them. He is considered by many to be the first important German hymnist after the Reformation and is regarded as the outstanding hymnwriter of the German Reformed Church.

== Life ==
Joachim Neander was born in Bremen, the son of a Latin teacher. His grandfather, a musician, had changed the family name from the original German &quot;Neumann&quot; (&#x27;New man&#x27; in English) to the Graeco-Roman form &quot;Neander&quot;, following the fashion of the time. After the death of his father, he could not afford to study at a famous university. He therefore studied theology in his hometown from 1666 to 1670. At first, his heart was not in it. It was only when he heard a sermon of Theodor Undereyk (shortly before the end of his course) that his beliefs became serious.

In 1671 he became a private tutor in Heidelberg, and in 1674 he became a teacher in a Latin school in Düsseldorf, one step before becoming a minister. While living there, he liked to go to the nearby valley of the Düssel river, nature being the inspiration for his poems. He also held gatherings and services in the valley, at which he gave sermons. The Neandertal valley (originally &quot;Neanderthal&quot;, from German &quot;Thal&quot; for &quot;valley,&quot; now spelled &quot;Tal&quot;, though both &quot;t&quot; and &quot;th&quot; represent a &quot;t&quot;-sound) was renamed in his honor in the early 19th century.

In 1679, Neander became a pastor of St Martin’s church in Bremen, as his popularity with the common people had caused problems with the church administration in Düsseldorf. One year later, at the age of 30, he died of tuberculosis.

==Notable works==

Being the first important hymn-writer of the German Reformed Church, Neander wrote his creations mostly at Düsseldorf. The minister and elders of the Reformed Church had complete control of the school at Düsseldorf. About July 1673 to about May 1677 the minister was Sylvester Lürsen (a native of Bremen, and a few years older than Neander), a man of ability and earnestness, but jealous, and, in later times at least, quarrelsome.

Neander worked harmoniously alongside him at first, frequently preaching in the church and assisting in the visitation of the sick. But he soon introduced practices which inevitably brought on a conflict. He began to hold prayer meetings of his own, without informing or consulting the minister or elders; he began to absent himself from Holy Communion, on the grounds that he could not conscientiously commune along with the unconverted, and also persuaded others to follow this example; and became less regular in his attendance at the ordinary services of the Church.

Besides these causes of offence, he drew out a new timetable for the school, made alterations on the school buildings, held examinations and appointed holidays without consulting anyone.

The result of all this was a Visitation of the school on Nov. 29, 1676, and then his suspension from school and pulpit on Feb. 3, 1677. On Feb. 17 he signed a full and definite declaration by which &quot;without mental reservations&quot; he bound himself not to repeat any of the acts complained of; and thereupon was permitted to resume his duties as rector but not as assistant minister.

The suspension thus lasted only 14 days, and his salary was never actually stopped. The statements that he was banished from Düsseldorf, and that he lived for months in a cave in the Neanderthal near Mettmann are therefore without foundation. Still his having had to sign such a document was a humiliation which he must have felt keenly, and when, after Lürsen&#x27;s departure, the second master of the Latin school was appointed permanent assistant pastor, this feeling would be renewed. 

==Creation of hymns==

A number were circulated among his friends at Düsseldorf in MS., but they were first collected and published after his removal to Bremen, and appeared as:

* A und Ώ, Joachimi Neandri Glaub-und Liebesübung: — auffgemuntert durch ein fällige Bundes Lieder und Danck-Psalmen, Bremen, Hermann Brauer, 1680.
* Second edition, Bremen, 1683.
* Third edition, Bremen, 1687. The so-called third edition at Wesel, 1686, also found in Berlin, was evidently pirated. Other editions rapidly followed until we find the complete set (i.e., 57 or 58) formally incorporated as part of a hymnbook, e.g. in the Marburg Reformed Gesang-Buch, 1722, where the first part consists of Lobwasser&#x27;s Psalter, the second of Neander&#x27;s Bundeslieder, and the third of other hymns. Neander&#x27;s Bundeslieder also form a division of the Lemgo Reformed Gesang-Buch, 1722.
* Fourth edition, Frankfurt, 1689. These editions contain 57 hymns.
* Fifth edition, Frankfurt and Leipzig, 1691, edited by G. C. Strattner, eight hymns were added as being also by Neander.

The whole of these editions are in the Royal Library, Berlin. One of his favourites book used in the meetings conducted by G. Tersteegen, which in the fifth edition, Solingen, 1760, has the title &quot;Gott-geheiligtes Harfen-Spiel der Kinder Zion; bestehend in Joachimi Neandri sämtlichen Bundes-Liedern&quot;. In this way, especially in the district near Düsseldorf and on the Ruhr, Neander&#x27;s name was honoured and beloved long after it had passed out of memory at Bremen.

<text>Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan ( 1933 – 2003) was a French-born statesman and activist who served as United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees from 1966 to 1977, during which he reoriented the agency&#x27;s focus beyond Europe and prepared it for an explosion of complex refugee issues. He was also a proponent of greater collaboration between non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and UN agencies. The Prince&#x27;s interest in ecological issues led him to establish the &quot;Bellerive Foundation&quot; in the late 1970s, and he was a knowledgeable and respected collector of Islamic art.

Born in Paris, France, he was the son of Sir Sultan Mahomed Shah Aga Khan and Princess Andrée Aga Khan. He married twice, but had no children of his own. Prince Sadruddin died of cancer at the age of 70, and was buried in Switzerland.

==Life and career==
===Childhood and education===
Born in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France, he was the only child of Sir Sultan Mahomed Shah Aga Khan III and his French-born third wife, the former Andrée Joséphine Carron. He received his early education in Lausanne, Switzerland, before graduating Phi Beta Kappa in 1954 from Harvard College. At Harvard, he lived in Eliot House with Paul Matisse, grandson of French artist Henri Matisse, with future &quot;Paris Review&quot; founders George Plimpton and John Train, and with Stephen Joyce, grandson of Irish writer James Joyce. Along with Plimpton, he was an editor for the &quot;Harvard Lampoon&quot;. After three years of post-graduate research at the Harvard Center for Middle Eastern Studies, Prince Sadruddin began a lifelong career of international service.

Although he was raised in Europe by his French mother, his father, who was the 48th hereditary Imam of the Nizari Ismaili Muslims, had a strong influence on him. He recalled that his father &quot;insisted that I learnt the Koran and encouraged me to understand the basic traditions and beliefs of Islam but without imposing any particular views. He was an overwhelming personality but open-minded and liberal.&quot;

Together with his father Prince Sadruddin traveled widely in Muslim countries, coming into contact with his Islamic roots from a young age. He described Iran as the cradle of his family, though he never lived there. When he was a child, his paternal grandmother used to recite to him the great epic poems of Persian history. He held British, French, Iranian, and Swiss citizenship, and was fluent in French, English, German and Italian, while also speaking some Persian and Arabic.

===UNESCO===
Prince Sadruddin joined the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 1958, and became the Executive Secretary to its International Action Committee for the Preservation of Nubia in 1961. This initiative brought together archaeologists from Eastern Europe and the West at the height of the Cold War. The construction of the Aswan Dam threatened ancient Egyptian treasures including Abu Simbel, the temples of Philae and Kalabsha, and the Christian churches of Nubia. He would later describe it as &quot;one of UNESCO&#x27;s great achievements&quot; because of the challenging historical context in which it took place—in particular the ongoing tensions in the Middle East and the Cold War.

===UN High Commissioner for Refugees===
Prince Sadruddin began as a Special Envoy to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in 1959 with a focus on World Refugee Year (1959–1960). The initiative became known for its &quot;Stamp Plan&quot;, a philatelic programme that raised funds through United Nations member countries, as well as the support of the Universal Postal Union. At the time, the UNHCR&#x27;s resources were primarily focused on supporting refugees crossing from Eastern Europe.

In January 1966, Prince Sadruddin was appointed United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees after serving for three years as Deputy High Commissioner. At the age of 33 he became the youngest person ever to lead the UNHCR. For the next twelve years he directed the UN refugee agency through one of its most difficult periods, coordinating the international response to the 1971 Bangladesh crisis that uprooted people, the 1972 exodus of hundreds of thousands of Hutus from Burundi to Tanzania, and the Vietnamese boat people tragedy of the mid-1970s. In 1972, Prince Sadruddin played a key role in finding new homes for tens of thousands of South Asians expelled from Uganda by Idi Amin.

Prince Sadruddin&#x27;s determination not to discriminate between European and Third World refugees helped prepare the UNHCR for a change in the landscape of internationally displaced persons. During the 1950s, between 200,000 and 300,000 refugees of European origin required assistance. By the 1970s the European refugee problems were mostly solved, but had been replaced by millions of displaced persons in the Third World. He had widened the UNHCR mandate well beyond its original focus on Eastern Europe, extending the organisation&#x27;s reach to refugees from Palestine, Vietnam, Angola and Algeria. As the scale and complexity of refugee issues continued to increase, the UNHCR and the international community at large was better positioned to adapt. By the end of 1977 when he chose to step down from the position, he had become the longest-serving UN High Commissioner for Refugees.

===United Nations diplomatic career===
Prince Sadruddin had, since 1978, been variously: Special Consultant and Chargé de Mission to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Special Rapporteur of the UN Human Rights Commission and Convenor and co-chairman of the Independent Commission on International Humanitarian Issues and of the Independent Working Group on the UN Financial Emergency. He was later Coordinator for United Nations Humanitarian and Economic Assistance Programmes Relating to the People of Afghanistan and Executive Delegate of the Secretary-General for a United Nations Inter-Agency Humanitarian Programme, which dealt with problems of Iraq&#x27;s border areas.

His appointment in September 1990 as Personal Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Humanitarian Assistance Relating to the Crisis between Iraq and Kuwait required diplomatic finesse. Iraq&#x27;s President Saddam Hussein was deeply suspicious of the UN, and was loath to do anything that would benefit the country&#x27;s Shia Muslims. Despite this, Prince Sadruddin was able to successfully negotiate with Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz for the establishment of a UN relief program for tens of thousands of Shia Muslims trapped in worsening conditions in the marshlands of southern Iraq.

Prince Sadruddin was nominated and passed over twice for the post of UN Secretary-General. Although he won the 1981 vote, the Soviet Union considered him too Western and vetoed his election. When he was nominated again in 1991, the United States and Britain expressed their disagreement with his belief in a policy of boosting aid to Iraq.

===Environmental protection and advocacy===
In 1977, Prince Sadruddin, together with Denis de Rougemont and a few other friends, established a Geneva-based think-tank, &quot;Groupe de Bellerive&quot; (named after Bellerive, the municipality where he lived in Geneva), and a non-profit organisation, the &quot;Bellerive Foundation&quot;. The foundation collaborated with international institutions, British and Scandinavian bilateral aid organizations, and other NGOs such as the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). It became a grassroots action group promoting environmental protection, natural resource conservation and the safeguarding of life in all its forms.

Initially, Bellerive worked with UNICEF and the United Nations Children&#x27;s Fund in the struggle against deforestation. Prince Sadruddin was motivated in part by what he called &quot;ecological refugees&quot;, who were forced to leave regions that could no longer sustain them due to desertification and other environmental changes. The foundation worked with Swiss specialists to develop low-cost, energy-efficient cooking stoves that relied on renewable energy sources such as methane and biogas. It distributed these among needy rural populations, primarily in Africa. Other areas of concern for Bellerive included the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and the protection of threatened species.

As a resident of Switzerland, Prince Sadruddin was concerned about the impact of insensitive tourist development and deforestation on the European Alps. At the World Economic Forum in 1990, he launched &quot;Alp Action&quot; to protect the mountain ecosystem and preserve the Alps&#x27; cultural diversity and vitality. The Bellerive Foundation program encouraged eco-tourism, aiming to reduce the impact of outdoor adventure sports on the fragile alpine habitat. During its years of operation, Alp Action successfully launched over 140 projects in seven countries. It found inspiration in the system of national parks of the Canadian Rockies.

A long-standing trustee and former vice-president of the World Wide Fund for Nature International, Prince Sadruddin led Bellerive&#x27;s support for threatened species. Bellerive was also amongst the first organisations to warn of the potential human health hazards of modern intensive farming methods.

In May 2006, the activities of the Bellerive Foundation were merged into the Geneva-based Aga Khan Foundation (founded in 1967 by Prince Sadruddin&#x27;s nephew Karim Aga Khan IV) to form the &quot;Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan Fund for the Environment&quot;. The US$10 million fund is dedicated to finding practical solutions to environmental problems. The fund concentrates its activities in six areas that were important to Prince Sadruddin: environmental education; natural resource management in fragile zones; nature parks and wildlife reserves; environmentally and culturally appropriate tourism infrastructure; environmental health; and research.

===Death and remembrance===
Prince Sadruddin died of cancer in Boston, Massachusetts, on 2003, coincidentally, the same day as his elder half-brother Prince Aly Khan had died 43 years earlier. His body was conveyed to Switzerland, where members of the diplomatic corps, government officials and close friends were invited to pay their last respects at the Château de Bellerive, and sign books of condolence at various locations around the world. Ruud Lubbers, then UNHCR High Commissioner, expressed the sadness of the UNHCR and the entire humanitarian community, commenting that &quot;he left an indelible print on UNHCR&#x27;s history—leading the agency through some of the most challenging moments. Sadruddin&#x27;s name became synonymous with UNHCR.&quot;

In accordance with his wishes, Prince Sadruddin&#x27;s burial took place at a private ceremony attended by members of his family. Traditional Muslim ceremonies were led by Sheikh Ahmed Ahmed Ibrahim, who leads the prayers at the mausoleum of the Prince&#x27;s father, Aga Khan III, in Aswan, Egypt. Last respects were paid beneath the arches of the Château de Bellerive, before the bier was carried to the local cemetery of Collonge-Bellerive. A tribute from the Canton of Geneva read: &quot;The destiny of this family of high Persian nobility, descended from the Prophet Muhammad, is inextricably linked to that of this small European town and to an ambitious project to improve the human condition.&quot;

The United Nations community celebrated Prince Sadruddin&#x27;s life at a memorial ceremony held in his honour at its headquarters in New York on 2003. He was remembered for representing the moral and compassionate side of the international community. Then United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan commented that &quot;he combined respect for humankind with concern for our environment. He worked on behalf of the poor and dispossessed, while celebrating humanity through culture and art.&quot; He concluded his tribute by praising Prince Sadruddin as &quot;a role model to many of us ... his example will continue to inspire new world citizens for several generations to come.&quot;

He was survived by his wife of 31 years, Princess Catherine; his three stepsons Alexandre, Marc and Nicolas; as well as his nephews and niece Prince Karim, Prince Amyn and Princess Yasmin; and his cousin Mme. Francoise Carron. It was Prince Sadruddin&#x27;s and Princess Catherine&#x27;s wish that their remains be buried in Egypt.

==Personal life==
Prince Sadruddin&#x27;s life was deeply influenced by his family roots and cultural heritage. Prince Sadruddin&#x27;s grandmother was the granddaughter of the Qajar Emperor Fath&#x27;Ali Shah.

International service was a family tradition, and throughout his life Prince Sadruddin was surrounded by it. His father held influential roles in British India. He also served two terms as President of the League of Nations. Prince Sadruddin&#x27;s older half-brother, Prince Aly Khan, was Pakistan&#x27;s Ambassador to the United Nations. Prince Karim Aga Khan IV, the 49th Imam of the Ismaili Muslims, was a nephew to Prince Sadruddin, and is the founder and Chairman of the Aga Khan Development Network. His brother, Prince Amyn, had previously worked with the United Nations before joining the Aga Khan&#x27;s secretariat. Meanwhile, Prince Sadruddin&#x27;s niece Princess Yasmin, has devoted herself to the fight against Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

Prince Sadruddin had a taste for culture, including music, art and literature. He was a familiar figure at music festivals and other cultural events, both in Europe and overseas. His concern for the environment was complemented by his enjoyment of the outdoors; he was a keen skier and an accomplished sailor. While still at Harvard in 1953, Prince Sadruddin became the founding publisher of the &quot;Paris Review&quot;, which was established with the aim of bringing original creative work to the fore. Every year the &quot;Review&quot; awards the Aga Khan Prize for Fiction (established by his father) for the best short story that it published in the past year.

===Marriages===
On 27 August 1957, in Bellerive, Switzerland, Prince Sadruddin married Nina Dyer (1930–1965). An Anglo-Indian fashion model, she was the former wife of Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza. She converted to Islam, taking the name &quot;Shirin&quot; (lit. &quot;sweetness&quot;). They had no children and divorced in 1962. Dyer died by suicide in 1965.

He married Catherine Aleya Beriketti Sursock on November 25, 1972, in the British West Indies. Born in Alexandria, she was the former wife of Lebanese aristocrat Cyril Sursock (son of Nicolas Sursock and Donna Vittoria Serra of the Dukes di Cassano). She and Prince Sadruddin had no children, but from this marriage he gained three stepchildren: Alexandre Sursock (married to Thai Princess &quot;Mom Rajawongse&quot; Charuvan Rangsit Prayurasakdi), Marc Sursock, and Nicolas Sursock.

===Art collection===
During his lifetime Prince Sadruddin assembled one of the finest private collections of Islamic art in the world. He became a knowledgeable and respected collector, accumulating a priceless collection of paintings, drawings, manuscripts and miniatures over 50 years. He had also gathered a collection of primitive and African art which he sold sometime prior to 1985.

Prince Sadruddin&#x27;s interest in Islamic art was sparked in his youth by his paternal grandmother&#x27;s library of Persian books, mystical texts and astrological treatises. While at Harvard in the 1950s, he would make purchases in New York, and eventually began to acquire from dealers in Paris, Geneva and London. He would bid regularly at Sotheby&#x27;s and Christie&#x27;s auctions in Europe and North America. For advice, he looked to his friend Stuart Cary Welch, a historian of Islamic art at Harvard University.

His collection is vast and diverse, and includes Arabic, Persian, Turkish, and Indian pieces dating from the 10th century. One example is a Quranic page of North African origin written with gold lettering in the Kufic script – it is more than 1,000 years old. Prince Sadruddin&#x27;s Persian roots are well represented in calligraphic as well as pictorial specimens reflecting a range of periods and dynastic patrons. Also included are several examples of Ottoman calligraphies, manuscripts and paintings.

Over the years, parts of his collection were exhibited in New York, London, and Zürich, including a touring show, &quot;Princes, Poets and Paladins&quot;, which was organized by the British Museum in 1998. The full collection is housed at the Aga Khan Museum in Toronto, established by Prince Sadruddin&#x27;s nephew, longtime Aga Khan until his death in 2025.

==Awards and decorations==
Prince Sadruddin received several honorary doctorates and national decorations from states as diverse as Pakistan, Poland and the Vatican, as well as the United Nations Human Rights Award. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1991. He was awarded the Bourgeois d&#x27;Honneur de Geneve, made a Commandeur of the Légion d&#x27;honneur of France and a Knight Commander of the Order of St. Sylvester (KCSS) of the Holy See, and was a recipient of the Order of the Nile of Egypt. Furthermore, he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE), this for his services to humanitarian causes and the arts. He was an honorary citizen of Patmos, Greece, where he owned a house.

<text>A seedbed or seedling bed is the local soil environment in which seeds are planted. Often, it comprises not only the soil but also a specially prepared cold frame, hotbed or raised bed used to grow the seedlings in a controlled environment into larger young plants before transplanting them into a garden or field. A seedling bed increases the number of seeds that germinate.

==Soil type==
The soil of a seedbed needs to be loose and smoothed, without large lumps. These traits are needed so that seeds can be planted easily, and at a specific depth for best germination. Large lumps and uneven surface would tend to make the planting depth random. Many types of seedlings also need loose soil with minimal rocky content for best conditions to grow their roots. (For example, carrots grown in rocky soil will tend not to grow straight.)

==Seedbed preparation==
Seedbed preparation in farm fields often involves secondary tillage via harrows and cultivators. This may follow primary tillage (if any) by moldboard plows or chisel plows. No-till farming methods avoid tillage for seedbed preparation as well as later weed control.

Seedbed preparation in gardens often involves secondary tillage via hand tools such as rakes and hoes. This may follow primary tillage (if any) by shovels, picks, or mattocks. Rotary tillers provide a powered alternative that takes care of both primary and secondary tillage.

The preparation of a seedbed may include:
# The removal of debris. Insect eggs and disease spores are often found in plant debris and so this is removed from the plot. Stones and larger debris will also physically prevent the seedlings from growing.
# Levelling. The site will have been levelled for even drainage.
# the soil. Compacted soil will be broken up by digging. This allows air and water to enter, and helps the seedling penetrate the soil. Smaller seeds require a finer soil structure. The surface the soil can be broken down into a fine granular structure using a tool such as a rake.
# Soil improvement. The soil structure may be improved by the introduction of organic matter such as compost or peat.
# Fertilizing. The nitrate and phosphate levels of the soil can be adjusted with fertilizer. If the soil is deficient in any micro nutrients, these too can be added.
The seedlings may be left to grow to adult plant.

<text>In biology, a septum (Latin for &quot;something that encloses&quot;; septa) is a wall, dividing a cavity or structure into smaller ones. A cavity or structure divided in this way may be referred to as septate.

==Examples==

===Human anatomy===
* Interatrial septum, the wall of tissue that is a sectional part of the left and right atria of the heart
* Interventricular septum, the wall separating the left and right ventricles of the heart
* Lingual septum, a vertical layer of fibrous tissue that separates the halves of the tongue
*Nasal septum: the cartilage wall separating the nostrils of the nose

* Alveolar septum: the thin wall which separates the alveoli from each other in the lungs
* Orbital septum, a palpebral ligament in the upper and lower eyelids
* Septum pellucidum or septum lucidum, a thin structure separating two fluid pockets in the brain
* Uterine septum, a malformation of the uterus
* Penile septum, a fibrous wall between the two corpora cavernosa penis
* Septum glandis, partition of the ventral aspect of the glans penis
* Scrotal septum, layer of tissue dividing the scrotum
* Vaginal septum, a lateral or transverse partition inside the vagina
* Intermuscular septa separating the muscles of the arms and legs
Histological septa are seen throughout most tissues of the body, particularly where they are needed to stiffen soft cellular tissue, and they also provide planes of ingress for small blood vessels. Because the dense collagen fibres of a septum usually extend out into the softer adjacent tissues, microscopic fibrous septa are less clearly defined than the macroscopic types of septa listed above. In rare instances, a septum is a cross-wall. Thus it divides a structure into smaller parts.

===Cell biology===
The septum (cell biology) is the boundary formed between dividing cells in the course of cell division.

===Fungus===

*A partition dividing filamentous hyphae into discrete cells in fungi.

===Botany===

*A partition that separates the locules of a fruit, anther, or sporangium.

===Zoology===

A coral septum is one of the radial calcareous plates in the corallites of a coral.

Annelids have septa that divide their coelom into segmented chambers.

Many shelled organisms have septa subdividing their shell chamber, including rhizopods, cephalopods and gastropods, the latter seemingly serving as a defence against shell-boring predators.

===Laboratory technology===
* A rubber septum is an engineered membrane that permits transfer of a substance (usually liquid or gas) without contact with air, usually using a syringe with needle.

<text>Milan R. Vukcevich (born Milan Radoje Vukčević; March 11, 1937 – May 10, 2003) was a Yugoslav-American chemist, a grandmaster of chess problem composition and writer.

==Biography==
Milan Radoje Vukčević was born in Belgrade. In 1955 he won the Yugoslav junior championship, drawing a six-game match with Bent Larsen in the same year. In 1960, he played for Yugoslavia at the Chess Olympiad in Leipzig and had the second-best overall score at the Student Chess Olympiad in Leningrad. In 1963 he moved to the US, settling in Ohio, and westernising his surname.

Vukcevich decided on a career in science rather than chess, and in the year he moved to the United States he entered MIT. He was an instructor at Case Western Reserve University for six years before leaving to work for General Electric, where, from 1989, he served as Chief Scientist. He published two books on science.

Vukcevich continued to play chess. In 1969 he was joint winner of the U.S. Open Chess Championship, along with Pal Benko and Robert Byrne. In 1975 he finished third in the U.S. Championship, ahead of Samuel Reshevsky, Robert Byrne, Larry Evans and Arthur Bisguier among others. From 1976-79, he played in the National Telephone League, scoring 16.5 from 22 games, including wins against Bisguier, Yasser Seirawan, Nick De Firmian and Leonid Shamkovich.

Vukcevich died in 2003 in Cleveland, Ohio and is buried in Evergreen Hill Cemetery in Chagrin Falls.

His son, Marko, is a former guitar player in the band Mushroomhead from Cleveland. The &quot;Vukcevich Super Cup&quot; was created in his honor soon after his death.

==Chess compositions==
Vukcevich is better known as an author of chess problems than as a player, however, being the first American resident to be awarded the title of International Composition Grandmaster by FIDE. In 1981 he published &quot;Chess by Milan: Problems and Games of Dr. Milan R. Vukcevich&quot; and in 1998 was inducted into the US Chess Hall of Fame, becoming only the second person (after Sam Loyd) to be primarily inducted for their achievements in problem composition.

Vukcevich&#x27;s compositions were gathered together in &quot;My Chess Compositions&quot; (2003). He composed in all genres, including direct mates, selfmates, helpmates, problems with fairy pieces and a small number of endgame studies.
On the left is one of Vukcevich&#x27;s famous problems. The key is 1. Bb6 with the threat 2. Qg6! and
3. Ne4# and 3. e4#. If 2. ... Rxf3 then 3. Rxf3#, which explains the choice of the key. In the main variations Black unpins the Queen, which can then form new batteries: 1. ... Rf5 2. Qf4!! (threat 3. Ne4#) Re5+ 3. Be4#; 2. ... Rxf4+ e4#. 1. ... Nf5! 2. Qh4!! (threat 3. Ne4#) Nxe3+ Rg6#; 2. ... Nxh4+ 3. e4#. Additional variation occurs after 1. ... e5 2. Qf5! Qxf5+ 3. e4#.

<text>Robert Stack (born Charles Langford Modini Stack; January 13, 1919 – May 14, 2003) was an American actor and television host. Known for his deep voice and commanding presence, he appeared in over forty feature films. He starred in the ABC television series &quot;The Untouchables&quot; (1959–1963), for which he won the 1960 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performance by an Actor in a Series, and later hosted/narrated the true-crime series &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot; (1987–2002). He was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in the film &quot;Written on the Wind&quot; (1956). Later in his career, Stack was known for his deadpan comedy roles that lampooned his dramatic on-screen persona, most notably as Captain Rex Kramer in &quot;Airplane!&quot; (1980).

== Early life ==
He was born Charles Langford Modini Stack in Los Angeles, California, but his first name, selected by his mother, was changed to Robert by his father. He spent his early childhood in Adria and Rome, becoming fluent in French and Italian at an early age, and did not learn English until returning to Los Angeles when he was seven.

His parents divorced when he was a year old, and he was raised by his mother, Mary Elizabeth (née Wood). His father, James Langford Stack, a wealthy advertising agency owner, later remarried his ex-wife, but died when Stack was 10.

He always spoke of his mother with the greatest respect and love. When he collaborated with Mark Evans on his autobiography, &quot;Straight Shooting,&quot; he included a picture of himself and his mother that he captioned &quot;Me and my best girl&quot;. His maternal grandfather, opera singer Charles Wood, studied voice in Italy and performed there under the name &quot;Carlo Modini.&quot; Stack had another opera-singer relative: American baritone Richard Bonelli (born George Richard Bunn), who was his uncle.

Stack took some drama courses at the University of Southern California, where he played on the polo team. Clark Gable was a family friend.

By the time he was 20, Stack had achieved minor fame as a sportsman. He was an avid polo player and shooter. His brother and he won the International Outboard Motor Championships, in Venice, Italy, and at age 16, he became a member of the All-American Skeet Team. He set two world records in skeet shooting and became national champion. In 1971, he was inducted into the National Skeet Shooting Hall of Fame. He was a Republican.

The Piikani Nation of the Blackfoot Confederacy, which was known as the Peigan Nation before the 1990s, honored him by inducting him into their chieftainship in 1953 (July 2, 1953, Newspaper) as Chief Crow Flag. In 1962, Stack received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

== Career ==
Stack took drama courses at Bridgewater State University, a mid-sized liberal-arts school located 25 miles southeast of Boston. His deep voice and good looks attracted the attention of producers in Hollywood. When Stack visited the lot of Universal Studios at age 20, producer Joe Pasternak offered him an opportunity to enter the business. Recalled Stack, &quot;He said, &#x27;How&#x27;d you like to be in pictures? We&#x27;ll make a test with Helen Parrish, a little love scene.&#x27; Helen Parrish was a beautiful girl. &#x27;Gee, that sounds keen,&#x27; I told him. I got the part.&quot;

Stack&#x27;s first film, which teamed him with Deanna Durbin, was &quot;First Love&quot; (1939), produced by Pasternak. This film was considered controversial at the time, as he was the first actor to give Durbin an on-screen kiss. Stack won critical acclaim for his next role, &quot;The Mortal Storm&quot; (1940) starring Margaret Sullavan and James Stewart, and directed by Frank Borzage at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. He played a young man who joins the Nazi party.

Back at Universal, Stack was in Pasternak&#x27;s &quot;A Little Bit of Heaven&quot; (1940), starring Gloria Jean, who was that studio&#x27;s back-up for Deanna Durbin. Stack was reunited with Durbin in Pasternak&#x27;s &quot;Nice Girl?&quot; (1941). Stack then starred in a Western, &quot;Badlands of Dakota&quot; (1942), co-starring Richard Dix and Frances Farmer.

United Artists borrowed him to play a Polish Air Force pilot in &quot;To Be or Not to Be&quot; (1942), alongside Jack Benny and Carole Lombard. Stack admitted he was terrified going into this role, but he credited Lombard, whom he had known personally for several years, with giving him many tips on acting and with being his mentor. Lombard was killed in a plane crash shortly before the film was released. Stack played another pilot in &quot;Eagle Squadron&quot; (1942), a huge hit. He then made a Western, &quot;Men of Texas&quot; (1942). During World War II, Stack served as an officer in the United States Navy. He worked as an aerial gunnery instructor and rose to the rank of lieutenant.

Stack resumed his career after the war with roles in such films as &quot;Fighter Squadron&quot; (1948) at Warner Bros. with Edmond O&#x27;Brien, playing a pilot; &quot;A Date with Judy&quot; (1948) at MGM, with Wallace Beery and Elizabeth Taylor. He made two films at Paramount: &quot;Miss Tatlock&#x27;s Millions&quot; (1948) and &quot;Mr. Music&quot; (1950). He had an excellent role in &quot;Bullfighter and the Lady&quot; (1951), a passion project of Budd Boetticher for John Wayne&#x27;s company. He later said this was the first time he liked himself on screen.

Stack supported Mickey Rooney in &quot;My Outlaw Brother&quot; (1951) and had the lead in the adventure epic &quot;Bwana Devil&quot; (1952), considered the first color, American 3-D feature film. It was released by United Artists, which also put Stack in a Western, &quot;War Paint&quot; (1953). He continued making similar low-budget action fare: &quot;Conquest of Cochise&quot; (1953) for Sam Katzman; &quot;Sabre Jet&quot; (1953), playing another pilot, this time in the Korean War; &quot;The Iron Glove&quot; (1954), a swashbuckler where Stack played Charles Wogan, for Katzman.

Stack was back in &quot;A&quot; pictures when he appeared opposite John Wayne in &quot;The High and the Mighty&quot; (1954), playing the pilot of an airliner who comes apart under stress after the airliner encounters engine trouble. The film was a hit, and Stack received good reviews. In 1954, he signed a seven-year contract with Fox. Sam Fuller cast him in the lead of &quot;House of Bamboo&quot; (1955), shot in Japan for 20th Century Fox. He supported Jennifer Jones in &quot;Good Morning, Miss Dove&quot; (1955), also at Fox, and starred in &quot;Great Day in the Morning&quot; (1956) at RKO, directed by Jacques Tourneur.
Stack was then given a role in &quot;Written on the Wind&quot; (1956), directed by Douglas Sirk and produced by Albert Zugsmith. Stack played another pilot, the son of a rich man who marries Lauren Bacall, who in turn falls for his best friend, played by Rock Hudson. The film was a massive success and Stack was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor; Dorothy Malone, who played Stack&#x27;s sister, was nominated for Best Supporting Actress. Malone won, but Stack lost, to Anthony Quinn. Stack felt that the primary reason he lost to Quinn was that 20th Century Fox, which had lent him to Universal-International, organized block voting against him to prevent one of their contract players from winning an Academy Award while working at another studio. Stack was reunited with Hudson, Malone, Zugsmith, and Sirk on &quot;The Tarnished Angels&quot; (1957), once more playing a pilot. At Fox, he was in &quot;The Gift of Love&quot; (1958) with Bacall. Stack then was given a real star role, playing the title part in John Farrow&#x27;s biopic, &quot;John Paul Jones&quot; (1959). Despite a large budget and an appearance by Bette Davis, it was not a success.
Stack portrayed the crimefighting Eliot Ness in the ABC television drama series &quot;The Untouchables&quot; (1959–1963) produced by Desilu Productions, in association with Stack&#x27;s Langford Productions. The show portrayed the ongoing battle between gangsters and a special squad of federal agents in prohibition-era Chicago. &quot;No one thought it was going to be a series,&quot; Stack once said, &quot;When you tell the same story every week, it seemed like a vendetta between Ness and the Italians.&quot; The show won Stack the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series at the 12th Primetime Emmy Awards in 1960.

During the series&#x27; run, Stack starred in a disaster film, &quot;The Last Voyage&quot; (1960), appearing opposite Malone. At Fox, he was in &quot;The Caretakers&quot; (1963) with Joan Crawford and he appeared in a special on hunting, &quot;The American Sportsman&quot;. He owned 25% of &quot;The Untouchables&quot; and &quot;The Caretaker&quot;. Stack worked in Europe for &quot;Is Paris Burning?&quot; (1966), &quot;The Peking Medallion&quot; (1967), &quot;Action Man&quot; (1967), and &quot;Story of a Woman&quot; (1970). He also appeared in &quot;Laura&quot; (1967).

Stack starred in a new drama series, rotating the lead with Tony Franciosa and Gene Barry in the lavish &quot;The Name of the Game&quot; (1968–1971). He played a former federal agent turned true-crime journalist, evoking memories of his role as Ness. In 1971, he sued CBS for $25 million for appearing in the documentary &quot;The Selling of the Pentagon&quot;, saying that the company had falsely portrayed him as doing propaganda to sell the Vietnam War, while in fact he&#x27;d been opposed from the start.

Stack played a pilot in the TV film &quot;Murder on Flight 502&quot; (1975) and was the lead in the series &quot;Most Wanted&quot; (1976), playing a tough, incorruptible police captain commanding an elite squad of special investigators, also evoking the Ness role. He later played a similar role in the series &quot;Strike Force&quot; (1981). He also starred in a French film, &quot;Second Wind&quot;, in 1978.
Stack parodied his own persona in the comedy &quot;1941&quot; (1979). His performance was well received and Stack became a comic actor, appearing in &quot;Airplane!&quot; (1980), &quot;Big Trouble&quot; (1986), &quot;Plain Clothes&quot; (1988), &quot;Caddyshack II&quot; (1988), &quot;Joe Versus the Volcano&quot; (1990), &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head Do America&quot; (1996), and &quot;BASEketball&quot; (1998). He also provided the voice for the character Ultra Magnus in &quot;The Transformers: The Movie&quot; (1986). In a more serious vein, he appeared in the action film &quot;Uncommon Valor&quot; (1983), the television miniseries &quot;George Washington&quot; (1984), and &quot;Hollywood Wives&quot; (1985), and appeared in several episodes of the primetime soap opera &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; in 1986. Stack&#x27;s series &quot;Strike Force&quot; was scheduled opposite &quot;Falcon Crest&quot;, where it quickly folded.

He began hosting &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot; in 1987. He thought very highly of the interactive nature of the show, saying that it created a &quot;symbiotic&quot; relationship between viewer and program, and that the hotline was a great crime-solving tool. &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot; aired from 1987 to 2002, first as specials in 1987 (Stack did not host all the specials, which were previously hosted by Raymond Burr and Karl Malden), then as a regular series on NBC (1988–1997), then on CBS (1997–1999) and Lifetime (2001–2002). Stack served as the show&#x27;s host during its entire original series run. Netflix revived the series in July 2020 with a six-episode run. This was years after Stack&#x27;s passing; Dennis Farina was the new host. Paying homage to Stack, a silhouette of the late host can be seen towards the end of the opening credits.

In 1991, Stack voiced the main police officer Lt. Littleboy (who is also the main protagonist and narrator) in &quot;The Real Story of Baa Baa Black Sheep&quot;. In 1996, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars was dedicated to him.

== Personal life and death ==

Stack was married to actress Rosemarie Bowe from 1956 until his death. They had two children, a son, Charles, and a daughter, Elizabeth.

He underwent radiation therapy for prostate cancer in October 2002, and died of heart failure at his home in Bel Air, Los Angeles, on May 14, 2003, at the age of 84.

<doc id="227519" wikidata="Q569545" url="?curid=227519" title="Operation Crossroads">
<text>Operation Crossroads was a pair of nuclear weapon tests conducted by the United States at Bikini Atoll in mid-1946. They were the first nuclear weapon tests since Trinity on July 16, 1945, and the first detonations of nuclear devices since the atomic bombing of Nagasaki on August 9, 1945. The purpose of the tests was to investigate the effect of nuclear weapons on warships.

The Crossroads tests were the first of many nuclear tests held in the Marshall Islands and the first to be publicly announced beforehand and observed by an invited audience, including a large press corps. They were conducted by Joint Army/Navy Task Force One, headed by Vice Admiral William H. P. Blandy rather than by the Manhattan Project, which had developed nuclear weapons during World War II. A fleet of 95 target ships was assembled in Bikini Lagoon and hit with two detonations of Fat Man plutonium implosion-type nuclear weapons of the kind dropped on Nagasaki in 1945, each with a yield of .

The first test was &quot;Able&quot;. The bomb was named &quot;Gilda&quot; after Rita Hayworth&#x27;s character in the 1946 film &quot;Gilda&quot; and was dropped from the B-29 Superfortress &quot;Dave&#x27;s Dream&quot; of the 509th Bombardment Group on July 1, 1946. It detonated above the target fleet and caused less than the expected amount of ship damage because it missed its aim point by .

The second test was &quot;Baker&quot;. The bomb was known as &quot;Helen of Bikini&quot; and was detonated underwater on July 25, 1946. Radioactive sea spray caused extensive contamination. A third deep-water test named &quot;Charlie&quot; was planned for 1947 but was canceled primarily because of the United States Navy&#x27;s inability to decontaminate the target ships after the &quot;Baker&quot; test. Ultimately, only nine target ships were able to be scrapped rather than scuttled. &quot;Charlie&quot; was rescheduled as Operation Wigwam, a deep-water shot conducted in 1955 off the coast of Mexico (Baja California).

Bikini&#x27;s native residents were evacuated from the island on board the &quot;LST-861&quot;, with most moving to the Rongerik Atoll. In the 1950s, a series of large thermonuclear tests rendered Bikini unfit for subsistence farming and fishing because of radioactive contamination. Bikini remains uninhabited , though it is occasionally visited by sport divers. 

Planners attempted to protect participants in the Operation Crossroads tests against radiation sickness, but one study showed that the life expectancy of participants was reduced by an average of three months. The &quot;Baker&quot; test&#x27;s radioactive contamination of all the target ships was the first case of immediate, concentrated radioactive fallout from a nuclear explosion. Chemist Glenn T. Seaborg, the longest-serving chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, called &quot;Baker&quot; &quot;the world&#x27;s first nuclear disaster.&quot;

==Background==
The first proposal to test nuclear weapons against naval warships was made on August 16, 1945, by Lewis Strauss, future chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission. In an internal memo to Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal, Strauss argued, &quot;If such a test is not made, there will be loose talk to the effect that the fleet is obsolete in the face of this new weapon and this will militate against appropriations to preserve a postwar Navy of the size now planned.&quot; With very few bombs available, he suggested a large number of targets widely dispersed over a large area. A quarter century earlier, in 1921, the Navy had suffered a public relations disaster when General Billy Mitchell&#x27;s bombers sank every target ship the Navy provided for the Project B ship-versus-bomb tests. The Strauss test would be designed to demonstrate ship survivability.
In August 1945, Senator Brien McMahon, who within a year would write the Atomic Energy Act and organize and chair the Congressional Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, made the first public proposal for such a test, but one designed to demonstrate the vulnerability rather than survivability of ships. He proposed dropping an atomic bomb on captured Japanese ships and suggested, &quot;The resulting explosion should prove to us just how effective the atomic bomb is when used against the giant naval ships.&quot; On September 19, the Chief of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF), General of the Army Henry H. Arnold, asked the Navy to set aside 10 of the 38 captured Japanese ships for use in the test proposed by McMahon.

Meanwhile, the Navy proceeded with its own plan, which was revealed at a press conference on October 27 by the Commander in Chief, United States Fleet, Fleet Admiral Ernest King. It involved between 80 and 100 target ships, most of them surplus U.S. ships. As the Army and the Navy maneuvered for control of the tests, Assistant Secretary of War Howard C. Peterson observed, &quot;To the public, the test looms as one in which the future of the Navy is at stake ... if the Navy withstands [the tests] better than the public imagines it will, in the public mind the Navy will have &#x27;won.

The Army&#x27;s candidate to direct the tests, Major General Leslie Groves, head of the Manhattan Project which built the bombs, did not get the job. The Joint Chiefs of Staff decided that because the Navy was contributing the most men and materiel, the test should be headed by a naval officer. Commodore William S. &quot;Deak&quot; Parsons was a naval officer who had worked on the Manhattan Project and participated in the bombing of Hiroshima. He had been promoted to assistant to the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Special Weapons, Vice Admiral William H. P. Blandy, whom Parsons proposed for the role. This recommendation was accepted, and on January 11, 1946, President Harry S. Truman appointed Blandy as head of Army/Navy Joint Task Force One (JTF-1), which was created to conduct the tests. Parsons became Deputy Task Force Commander for Technical Direction. USAAF Major General William E. Kepner was Deputy Task Force Commander for Aviation. Blandy codenamed the tests Operation Crossroads.

Under pressure from the Army, Blandy agreed to crowd more ships into the immediate target area than the Navy wanted, but he refused USAAF Major General Curtis LeMay&#x27;s demand that &quot;every ship must have a full loading of oil, ammunition, and fuel.&quot; Blandy&#x27;s argument was that fires and internal explosions might sink ships that would otherwise remain afloat and be available for damage evaluation. When Blandy proposed an all-Navy board to evaluate the results, Senator McMahon complained to Truman that the Navy should not be &quot;solely responsible for conducting operations which might well indeed determine its very existence.&quot; Truman acknowledged that &quot;reports were getting around that these tests were not going to be entirely on the level.&quot; He imposed a civilian review panel on Operation Crossroads to &quot;convince the public it was objective.&quot;

==Opposition==

Pressure to cancel Operation Crossroads altogether came from scientists and diplomats. Manhattan Project scientists argued that further testing was unnecessary and environmentally dangerous. A Los Alamos study warned &quot;the water near a recent surface explosion will be a witch&#x27;s brew&quot; of radioactivity. When the scientists pointed out that the tests might demonstrate ship survivability while ignoring the effect of radiation on sailors, Blandy responded by adding test animals to some of the ships, thereby generating protests from animal rights advocates. J. Robert Oppenheimer declined an invitation to attend the test and wrote President Truman about his objections to it, arguing that any data obtained from the test could be obtained more accurately and cheaply in a laboratory.

Secretary of State James F. Byrnes, who a year earlier had told physicist Leo Szilard that a public demonstration of the bomb might make the Soviet Union &quot;more manageable&quot; in Europe, now argued the opposite: that further display of U.S. nuclear power could harden the Soviet Union&#x27;s position against acceptance of the Acheson–Lilienthal Plan, which discussed possible methods for the international control of nuclear weapons and the avoidance of future nuclear warfare. At a March 22 cabinet meeting he said, &quot;from the standpoint of international relations it would be very helpful if the test could be postponed or never held at all.&quot; He prevailed on Truman to postpone the first test for six weeks, from May 15 to July 1. For public consumption, the postponement was explained as an opportunity for more Congressional observers to attend during their summer recess.

When Congressmen complained about the destruction of $450 million worth of target ships, Blandy replied that their true cost was their scrap value at $10 per ton, only $3.7 million. Veterans and legislators from New York and Pennsylvania requested to keep their namesake battleships as museum ships, as Texas had done with , but the JTF-1 replied that &quot;it is regretted that such ships as the cannot be spared.&quot;

==Preparation==

A series of three tests was recommended to study the effects of nuclear weapons on ships, equipment, and materiel. The test site had to be in territory controlled by the United States. The inhabitants would have to be evacuated, so it was best if it was uninhabited, or nearly so, and at least from the nearest city. So that a B-29 Superfortress could drop a bomb, there had to be an airbase within . To contain the target ships, it needed to have a protected anchorage at least wide. Ideally, it would have predictable weather patterns and be free of severe cold and violent storms. Predictable winds would avoid having radioactive material blown back on the task force personnel, and predictable ocean currents would allow material to be kept away from shipping lanes, fishing areas, and inhabited shores. Timing was critical because Navy manpower required to move the ships was being released from active duty as part of the post-World War II demobilization, and civilian scientists knowledgeable about atomic weapons were leaving federal employment for college teaching positions.

On January 24, Blandy named the Bikini Lagoon as the site for the two 1946 detonations, &quot;Able&quot; and &quot;Baker&quot;. The deep underwater test, &quot;Charlie&quot;, scheduled for early 1947, would take place in the ocean west of Bikini. Of the possible places given serious consideration, including Ecuador&#x27;s Galápagos Islands, Bikini offered the most remote location with a large protected anchorage, suitable but not ideal weather, and a small, easily moved population. It had come under exclusive United States control on January 15, when Truman declared the United States to be the sole trustee of all the Pacific islands captured from Japan during the war. The Navy had been studying test sites since October 1945 and was ready to announce its choice of Bikini soon after Truman&#x27;s declaration. On February 6, the survey ship &quot;Sumner&quot; began blasting channels through the Bikini reef into the lagoon. The local residents were not told why.

The 167 Bikini islanders first learned their fate four days later, on Sunday, February 10, when Navy Commodore Ben H. Wyatt, United States military governor of the Marshall Islands, arrived by seaplane from Kwajalein. Referring to Biblical stories which they had learned from Protestant missionaries, he compared them to &quot;the children of Israel whom the Lord saved from their enemy and led into the Promised Land.&quot; He also claimed it was &quot;for the good of mankind and to end all world wars.&quot; There was no signed agreement, but he reported by cable &quot;their local chieftain, referred to as King Juda, arose and said that the natives of Bikini were very proud to be part of this wonderful undertaking.&quot; On March 6, Wyatt attempted to stage a filmed reenactment of the February 10 meeting in which the Bikinians had given away their atoll. Despite repeated promptings and at least seven retakes, Juda confined his on-camera remarks to, &quot;We are willing to go. Everything is in God&#x27;s hands.&quot; The next day, LST-861 moved them and their belongings east to the uninhabited Rongerik Atoll, to begin a permanent exile. Three Bikini families returned in 1974 but were evacuated again in 1978 because of radioactivity in their bodies from four years of eating contaminated food. As of 2022, the atoll remains unpopulated.

===Ships===

To make room for the target ships, of dynamite were used to remove coral heads from Bikini Lagoon. On the grounds of the David Taylor Model Basin outside Washington, DC, dress rehearsals for &quot;Baker&quot; were conducted with dynamite and model ships in a pond named &quot;Little Bikini.&quot; A fleet of 93 target vessels was assembled in Bikini Lagoon. At the center of the target cluster, the density was 20 ships per square mile (7.7 per km2), three to five times greater than military doctrine would allow. The stated goal was not to duplicate a realistic anchorage but to measure damage as a function of distance from the blast center, at as many distances as possible. The arrangement also reflected the outcome of the Army/Navy disagreement about how many ships should be allowed to sink.

The target fleet included four obsolete U.S. battleships, two aircraft carriers, two cruisers, thirteen destroyers, eight submarines, forty landing ships, eighteen transports, two oilers, one floating drydock, and three surrendered Axis ships, the Japanese cruiser &quot;Sakawa&quot;, the battleship &quot;Nagato&quot;, and the German cruiser &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;. The ships carried sample amounts of fuel and ammunition, plus scientific instruments to measure air pressure, ship movement, and radiation. The live animals on some of the target ships were supplied by the support ship , which brought 200 pigs, 60 guinea pigs, 204 goats, 5,000 rats, 200 mice, and grains containing insects to be studied for genetic effects by the National Cancer Institute. Amphibious target ships were beached on Bikini Island.

A support fleet of more than 150 ships provided quarters, experimental stations, and workshops for most of the 42,000 men (more than 37,000 of whom were Navy personnel) and the 37 female nurses. Additional personnel were located on nearby atolls such as Eniwetok and Kwajalein. Navy personnel were allowed to extend their service obligation for one year if they wanted to participate in the tests and see an atomic bomb explode. The islands of the Bikini Atoll were used as instrumentation sites and, until &quot;Baker&quot; contaminated them, as recreation sites.

===Cameras===
Radio-controlled autopilots were installed in eight B-17 bombers, converting them into remote-controlled drones which were then loaded with automatic cameras, radiation detectors, and air sample collectors. Their pilots operated them from mother planes at a safe distance from the detonations. The drones could fly into radiation environments, such as &quot;Able&#x27;s&quot; mushroom cloud, which would have been lethal to crew members. All the land-based detonation-sequence photographs were taken by remote control from tall towers erected on several islands of the atoll. In all, Bikini cameras took 50,000 still pictures and of motion picture film. One of the cameras could shoot 1,000 frames per second.

Before the first test, all personnel were evacuated from the target fleet and Bikini Atoll. They boarded ships of the support fleet, which took safe positions at least east of the atoll. Test personnel were issued special dark glasses to protect their eyes, but a decision was made shortly before &quot;Able&quot; that the glasses might not be adequate. Personnel were instructed to turn away from the blast, shut their eyes, and cradle their arm across their face for additional protection. A few observers who disregarded the recommended precautions advised the others when the bomb detonated. Most shipboard observers reported feeling a slight concussion and hearing a disappointing little &quot;poom&quot;.
On July 26, 2016, the National Security Archive declassified and released the entire stock of footage shot by surveillance aircraft that flew over the nuclear test site just minutes after the bomb detonated. The footage can be seen on YouTube.

===Nicknames===

&quot;Able&quot; and &quot;Baker&quot; are the first two letters of the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet, used from 1941 until 1956. &quot;Alfa&quot; and &quot;Bravo&quot; are their counterparts in the current NATO phonetic alphabet. &quot;Charlie&quot; is the third letter in both systems. According to eyewitness accounts, the time of detonation for each test was announced as H or &quot;How&quot; hour; in the official JTF-1 history, the term M or &quot;Mike&quot; hour is used instead.

There were only seven nuclear bombs in existence in July 1946. The two bombs used in the test were Fat Man plutonium implosion-type nuclear weapons of the kind dropped on Nagasaki. The &quot;Able&quot; bomb was stenciled with the name &quot;Gilda&quot; and decorated with an &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine photograph of Rita Hayworth, star of the 1946 movie, &quot;Gilda&quot;. The &quot;Baker&quot; bomb was &quot;Helen of Bikini.&quot; This femme-fatale theme for nuclear weapons, combining seduction and destruction, is epitomized by the use in all languages, starting in 1946, of &quot;bikini&quot; as the name for a woman&#x27;s two-piece bathing suit.

The United States&#x27; test series summary table is here: United States&#x27; nuclear testing series.

==Test &quot;Able&quot;==

=== Detonation ===
At 09:00 on July 1, 1946, &quot;Gilda&quot; was dropped from the B-29 &quot;Dave&#x27;s Dream&quot; of the 509th Bombardment Group. The plane, formerly known as &quot;Big Stink&quot;, had been the photographic equipment aircraft on the Nagasaki mission in 1945. It had been renamed in honor of Dave Semple, a bombardier who was killed during a practice mission on March 7, 1946. &quot;Gilda&quot; detonated above the target fleet, with a yield of 23 kilotons. Five ships were sunk. Two attack transports sank immediately, two destroyers within hours, and &quot;Sakawa&quot; the following day.

Some of the 114 press observers expressed disappointment at the effect on ships. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported, prematurely, that &quot;only two were sunk, one capsized, and eighteen damaged.&quot; The next day, the &quot;Times&quot; carried an explanation by Forrestal that &quot;heavily built and heavily armored ships are difficult to sink unless they sustain underwater damage.&quot;

The main cause of less-than-expected ship damage was that the bomb missed its aim point by . The ship the bomb was aimed at failed to sink. The miss resulted in a government investigation of the flight crew of the B-29 bomber. Various explanations were offered, including the bomb&#x27;s known poor ballistic characteristics, but none was convincing. Images of the drop were inconclusive. The bombsight was checked and found error free. Pumpkin bomb drops were conducted and were accurate. Colonel Paul W. Tibbets believed that the miss was caused by a miscalculation by the crew. The mystery was never solved. 

There were other factors that made &quot;Able&quot; less spectacular than expected. Observers were much farther away than at the Trinity test, and the high humidity absorbed much of the light and heat.

The battleship , the only battleship to get underway at the Attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, had been designated as the aim point for &quot;Able&quot; and was painted orange, with white gun barrels and gunwales, to make her stand out in the central cluster of target ships. There were eight ships within of it. Had the bomb exploded over the &quot;Nevada &quot;as planned, at least nine ships, including two battleships and an aircraft carrier, likely would have sunk. The actual detonation point, west-northwest of the target, was closer to the attack transport , in much less crowded water.

===&quot;Able&quot; Target array===


In addition to the five ships that sank, fourteen were judged to have serious damage or worse, mostly as a result of the shock wave. All but three were located within of the detonation. Inside that radius, orientation to the bomb was a factor in shock wave impact. For example, ship #6, the destroyer , which sank, was farther away than seven ships that stayed afloat. &quot;Lamson&quot; was broadside to the blast, taking the full impact on her port side, while the seven closer ships were anchored with their sterns toward the blast, somewhat protecting the most vulnerable part of the hull.

The only large ship inside the 1000-yard radius which sustained moderate rather than serious damage was the sturdily built Japanese battleship , ship #7, whose stern-on orientation to the bomb gave her some protection. Unrepaired damage from World War II may have complicated damage analysis. As the ship from which the Pearl Harbor attack had been commanded, &quot;Nagato&quot; was positioned near the aim point to guarantee her being sunk. The &quot;Able&quot; bomb missed its target, and the symbolic sinking came three weeks later, five days after the &quot;Baker&quot; shot.

Fire caused serious damage to ship #10, the aircraft carrier , more than from the blast. For test purposes, all the ships carried sample amounts of fuel and ordnance, plus airplanes. Most warships carried a seaplane on deck which could be lowered into the water by crane, but &quot;Saratoga&quot; carried several airplanes with highly volatile aviation fuel, both on deck and in the hangars below. The fire was extinguished, and &quot;Saratoga&quot; was kept afloat for use in the &quot;Baker&quot; shot.

===Radiation===

As with Little Boy (Hiroshima) and Fat Man (Nagasaki), the Crossroads &quot;Able&quot; shot was an air burst. These were purposely detonated high enough in the air to prevent surface materials from being drawn into the fireball. The height-of-burst for the Trinity test was ; the device was mounted on a tower. It made a crater deep and wide, and there was some local fallout. The test was conducted in secret, and the world at large learned nothing about the radioactive fallout at the time. To be a true air burst with no local fallout, the Trinity height-of-burst needed to be . With an air burst, the radioactive fission products rise into the stratosphere and become part of the global, rather than the local, environment. Air bursts were officially described as &quot;self-cleansing.&quot; There was no significant local fallout from &quot;Able&quot;.

There was an intense transitory burst of fireball radiation lasting a few seconds. Many of the closer ships received doses of neutron and gamma radiation that could have been lethal to anyone on the ship, but the ships did not become radioactive. Neutron activation of materials in the ships was judged to be a minor problem by the standards of the time. One sailor on the support ship was found to be &quot;sleeping in a shower of gamma rays&quot; from an illegal metal souvenir he had taken from a target ship. Fireball neutrons had made it radioactive. Within a day nearly all the surviving target ships had been reboarded. The ship inspections, instrument recoveries, and moving and remooring of ships for the &quot;Baker&quot; test proceeded on schedule.

=== Test animals ===
57 guinea pigs, 109 mice, 146 pigs, 176 goats, and 3,030 white rats had been placed on 22 target ships in stations normally occupied by people. 35% of these animals died or were euthanised in the three months following the explosion: 10% were killed by the air blast, 15% were killed by radiation, and 10% were killed by the researchers as part of later study. The most famous survivor was Pig #311, which was reportedly found swimming in the lagoon after the blast and was brought back to the National Zoo in Washington, DC. The mysterious survival of Pig #311 caused some consternation at the time and has continued to be reported in error. However, an investigation pointed to the conclusion that it had neither swum in the ocean nor escaped the blast; it had likely been safely aboard an observation vessel during the test, thus &quot;absent without leave&quot; from its post on &quot;Sakawa&quot; and showing up about the same time other surviving pigs were captured.

The high rate of test animal survival was due in part to the nature of single-pulse radiation. As with the two Los Alamos criticality accidents involving the earlier demon core, victims who were close enough to receive a lethal dose died, while those farther away recovered and survived. Also, all the mice were placed outside the expected lethal zone in order to study possible mutations in future generations.

Although &quot;Gilda&quot; missed its target &quot;Nevada&quot; by nearly half a mile (800 meters), and it failed to sink or to contaminate the battleship, a crew would not have survived. Goat #119, tethered inside a gun turret and shielded by armor plate, received enough fireball radiation to die four days later of radiation sickness having survived two days longer than goat #53, which was on the deck, unshielded. Had &quot;Nevada &quot;been fully manned, she would likely have become a floating coffin, dead in the water for lack of a live crew. Two years later she was finished off by an aerial torpedo 65 miles southwest of Pearl Harbor on 31 July 1948. In theory, every unprotected location on the ship received 10,000 rems (100 Sv) of initial nuclear radiation from the fireball. Therefore, people deep enough inside the ship to experience a 90% radiation reduction would still have received a lethal dose of 1,000 rems. In the assessment of the &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot;:


==Test &quot;Baker&quot;==

=== Detonation ===
In &quot;Baker&quot; on July 25, the weapon was suspended beneath landing craft &quot;LSM-60&quot; anchored in the midst of the target fleet. &quot;Baker&quot; was detonated at 08:35, underwater, halfway to the bottom in water deep. No identifiable part of &quot;LSM-60&quot; was ever found; it was presumably vaporized by the nuclear fireball. Ten ships were sunk, including the German heavy cruiser &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;, which sank in December, five months after the test, because radioactivity prevented repairs to a leak in the hull.

Photographs of &quot;Baker&quot; are unique among nuclear detonation pictures. The searing, blinding flash that usually obscures the target area took place underwater and was barely seen. The clear image of ships in the foreground and background gives a sense of scale. The large condensation cloud and the vertical water column are distinctive &quot;Baker&quot; shot features. One picture shows a mark where the 27,000-ton battleship was.

As with &quot;Able&quot;, any ships that remained afloat within of the detonation were seriously damaged, but this time the damage came from below, from water pressure rather than air pressure. The greatest difference between the two shots was the radioactive contamination of all the target ships by &quot;Baker&quot;. Regardless of the degree of damage, only nine surviving &quot;Baker&quot; target ships were eventually decontaminated and sold for scrap. The rest were sunk at sea after decontamination efforts failed.

===&quot;Baker&quot; Target array===

, ship #36, survived both the &quot;Able&quot; and &quot;Baker&quot; tests but was too radioactive to have leaks repaired. In September 1946 she was towed to Kwajalein Atoll, where she capsized in shallow water on December 22. She remains there today, with starboard propeller blades in the air.

The submarine was the only sunken ship successfully raised at Bikini. She was towed to California and sunk again, as a target ship off the coast, two years later.
Three other ships, all in sinking condition, were towed ashore at Bikini and beached: attack transport , ship #25; destroyer , ship #27; and submarine , ship #24. &quot;Dentuda&quot;, with her crew safely away from their submarine, being submerged (thus avoiding the base surge) and outside the 1000-yard circle, escaped serious contamination and hull damage and was successfully decontaminated, repaired, and briefly returned to service.

===Sequence of blast events===

The &quot;Baker&quot; shot produced so many unusual phenomena that a conference was held two months later to standardize nomenclature and define new terms for use in descriptions and analysis. The underwater fireball took the form of a rapidly expanding hot gas bubble that pushed against the water, generating a supersonic hydraulic shock wave which crushed the hulls of nearby ships as it spread out. Eventually it slowed to the speed of sound in water, which is one mile per second (1,600 m/s), five times faster than that of sound in air. On the surface, the shock wave was visible as the leading edge of a rapidly expanding ring of dark water, called the &quot;slick&quot; for its resemblance to an oil slick. Close behind the slick was a visually more dramatic but less destructive whitening of the water surface called the &quot;crack&quot;.

When the gas bubble&#x27;s diameter equaled the water depth, , it hit the sea floor and the sea surface simultaneously. At the bottom, it created a shallow crater deep and wide. At the top, it pushed the water above it into a &quot;spray dome&quot;, which burst through the surface like a geyser. Elapsed time since detonation was four milliseconds.

During the first full second, the expanding bubble removed all the water within a radius and lifted two million tons of spray and seabed sand into the air. As the bubble rose at , it stretched the spray dome into a hollow cylinder or chimney of spray called the &quot;column&quot;, tall and wide, with walls thick.

As soon as the bubble reached the air, it started a supersonic atmospheric shock wave which, like the crack, was more visually dramatic than destructive. Brief low pressure behind the shock wave caused instant fog which shrouded the developing column in a &quot;Wilson cloud&quot;, also called a &quot;condensation cloud&quot;, obscuring it from view for two seconds. The Wilson cloud started out hemispherical, expanded into a disk which lifted from the water revealing the fully developed spray column, then expanded into a doughnut shape and vanished. The &quot;Able&quot; shot also produced a Wilson cloud, but heat from the fireball dried it out more quickly.

By the time the Wilson cloud vanished, the top of the column had become a &quot;cauliflower&quot;, and all the spray in the column and its cauliflower was moving down, back into the lagoon. Although cloudlike in shape, the cauliflower was more like the top of a geyser where water stops moving upward and starts to fall. There was no mushroom cloud; nothing rose into the stratosphere.

Meanwhile, lagoon water rushing back into the space vacated by the rising gas bubble started a tsunami which lifted the ships as it passed under them. At 11 seconds after detonation, the first wave was from surface zero and high. By the time it reached the Bikini Island beach, away, it was a nine-wave set with shore breakers up to high, which tossed landing craft onto the beach and filled them with sand.

Twelve seconds after detonation, falling water from the column started to create a tall &quot;base surge&quot; resembling the mist at the bottom of a large waterfall. Unlike the water wave, the base surge rolled over rather than under the ships. Of all the bomb&#x27;s effects, the base surge had the greatest consequence for most of the target ships, because it painted them with radioactivity that could not be removed. Tactical nuclear warfare advocates described the base surge as generation of very high sea states (GVHSS) disregarding radiation to emphasize the physical damage capable of disabling communication and radar equipment on warship superstructures.

===&quot;Arkansas&quot;===

&quot;Arkansas&quot; was the closest ship to the bomb other than the ship from which it was suspended. The underwater shock wave crushed the starboard side of her hull, which faced the bomb, and rolled the battleship over onto her port side. It also ripped off the two starboard propellers and their shafts, along with the rudder and part of the stern, shortening the hull by .

She was next seen by Navy divers the same year, lying upside down with her bow on the rim of the underwater bomb crater and stern angled toward the center. There was no sign of the superstructure or the big guns. The first diver to reach &quot;Arkansas&quot; sank up to his armpits in radioactive mud. When National Park Service divers returned in 1989 and 1990, the bottom was again firm-packed with sand, and the mud was gone. They were able to see the barrels of the forward guns, which had not been visible in 1946.

All battleships are top-heavy and tend to settle upside down when they sink. &quot;Arkansas&quot; settled upside down, but a 1989 diver&#x27;s sketch of the wreck shows hardly any of the starboard side of the hull, making it look like the ship is lying on her side. Most of the starboard side is present but severely compacted.

The superstructure has not been found. It either was stripped off and swept away or is lying under the hull, crushed and buried under sand which flowed back into the crater, partially refilling it. The only diver access to the inside is a tight squeeze through the port side casemate, called the &quot;aircastle.&quot; The National Park Service divers practiced on the similar casemate of the battleship , a museum ship, before entering &quot;Arkansas&quot; in 1990.

Contrary to popular belief, &quot;Arkansas&quot; was not lifted vertically by the blast of the weapon test. Forensic examination of the wreck during surveys since the test conclusively show that structural failure of hull plating along the starboard side allowed rapid flooding and capsized the ship.

===Aircraft carriers===

&quot;Saratoga&quot;, placed close to &quot;Baker&quot;, sank 7.5 hours after the underwater shock wave opened up leaks in the hull. Immediately after the shock wave passed, the water wave lifted the stern and the bow , rocked the ship side to side, and crashed over her, sweeping all five moored airplanes off the flight deck and knocking the stack over onto the deck. She remained upright and outside the spray column but close enough to be drenched by radioactive water from the collapsing cauliflower head as well as by the base surge. Blandy ordered tugs to tow the carrier to Enyu Island for beaching, but &quot;Saratoga&quot; and the surrounding water remained too radioactive for close approach until after she sank. She settled upright on the bottom, with the top of her mast below the surface.

 survived &quot;Able&quot; with spectacular damage to the flight deck. She was moored far enough away from &quot;Baker&quot; to avoid further physical damage but was severely contaminated. She was towed to San Francisco, where four years of decontamination experiments at the Hunters Point Naval Shipyard failed to produce satisfactory results. On January 29, 1951, she was scuttled near the Farallon Islands.

===Fission-product radioactivity===

&quot;Baker&quot; was the first nuclear explosion close enough to the surface to keep the radioactive fission products in the local environment. It was not &quot;self-cleansing.&quot; The result was radioactive contamination of the lagoon and the target ships. While anticipated, it caused far greater problems than were expected.

The &quot;Baker&quot; explosion produced about of fission products. These fission products were thoroughly mixed with the two million tons of spray and seabed sand that were lifted into the spray column and its cauliflower head and then dumped back into the lagoon. Most of it stayed in the lagoon and settled to the bottom or was carried out to sea by the lagoon&#x27;s internal tidal and wind-driven currents.

A small fraction of the contaminated spray was thrown back into the air as the base surge. Unlike the Wilson cloud, a meteorological phenomenon in clean air, the base surge was a heavy fog bank of radioactive mist that rolled across all the target ships, coating their surfaces with fission products. When the mist in the base surge evaporated, the base surge became invisible but continued to move away, contaminating ships several miles from the detonation point.

Unmanned boats were the first vessels to enter the lagoon. Onboard instruments allowed remote-controlled radiation measurements to be made. When support ships entered the lagoon for evaluation, decontamination, and salvage activities, they steered clear of lagoon water hot spots detected by the drone boats. The standard for radiation exposure to personnel was the same as that used by the Manhattan Project: 0.1 roentgens per day. Because of this constraint, only the five most distant target ships could be boarded on the first day. The closer-in ships were hosed down by Navy fireboats using saltwater and flame retardants. The first hosing reduced radioactivity by half, but subsequent hosings were ineffective. For most of the ships, reboarding had to wait until the short-lived radioisotopes decayed; ten days elapsed before the last of the targets could be boarded.

In the first six days after &quot;Baker&quot;, when radiation levels were highest, 4,900 men boarded target ships. Sailors tried to scrub off the radioactivity with brushes, water, soap, and lye. Nothing worked, short of sandblasting to bare metal.

===Test animals===
Only pigs, goats and rats were used in the &quot;Baker&quot; test. All the pigs and most of the rats died. Several days elapsed before sailors were able to board the target ships where test animals were located; during that time the accumulated doses from the gamma rays produced by fission products became lethal for the animals. Since much of the public interest in Operation Crossroads had focused on the fate of the test animals, in September Blandy asserted that radiation death is not painful: &quot;The animal merely languishes and recovers or dies a painless death. Suffering among the animals as a whole was negligible.&quot; This was clearly not true. While the well-documented suffering of Harry Daghlian and Louis Slotin as they died of radiation injury at Los Alamos was still secret, the widely reported radiation deaths at Hiroshima and Nagasaki had not been painless. In 1908, Dr. Charles Allen Porter had stated in an academic paper, &quot;the agony of inflamed X-ray lesions is almost unequalled in any other disease.&quot;

===Induced radioactivity===

The &quot;Baker&quot; explosion ejected into the environment about twice as many free neutrons as there were fission events. A plutonium fission event produces, on average, 2.9 neutrons, most of which are consumed in the production of more fission, until fission falls off and the remaining uncaptured neutrons escape. In an air burst, most of these environmental neutrons are absorbed by superheated air which rises into the stratosphere, along with the fission products and unfissioned plutonium. In the underwater &quot;Baker&quot; detonation, the neutrons were captured by seawater in the lagoon.

Of the four major elements in seawater – hydrogen, oxygen, sodium, and chlorine – only sodium takes on intense, short-term radioactivity with the addition of a single neutron to its nucleus: common sodium-23 becomes radioactive sodium-24, with a 15-hour half-life. In six days, its intensity drops a thousandfold, but the corollary of short half-life is high initial intensity. Other isotopes were produced from seawater: hydrogen-3 (half-life 12 years) from hydrogen-2, oxygen-17 (stable) from oxygen-16, and chlorine-36 (half-life about 300,000 years) from chlorine-35, and some trace elements, but scarcity or low short-term intensity (long half-life) rendered them insignificant compared with sodium-24.

Less than one pound of radioactive sodium was produced. If all the neutrons released by the fission of of plutonium-239 were captured by sodium-23, of sodium-24 would result, but sodium did not capture all the neutrons. Unlike fission products, which are heavy and eventually sank to the bottom of the lagoon, the sodium stayed in solution. It contaminated the hulls and onboard salt water systems of support ships that entered the lagoon, as well as the water used in decontamination.

===Unfissioned plutonium===

The of plutonium which did not undergo fission and the of fission products were scattered. Plutonium is not a biological hazard unless ingested or inhaled, and its alpha radiation cannot penetrate skin. Once inside the body it is significantly toxic both radiologically and chemically, having a heavy metal toxicity on a par with that of arsenic. Estimates based on the Manhattan Project&#x27;s &quot;tolerance dose&quot; of one microgram of plutonium per worker put 10.6 pounds at the equivalent of about five billion tolerable doses.

Plutonium alpha rays could not be detected by the film badges and Geiger counters used by people who boarded the target ships because alpha particles have very low penetrating power, insufficient to enter the glass detection tube. It was assumed to be present in the environment wherever fission product radiation was detected. The decontamination plan was to scrub the target ships free of fission products and assume the plutonium would be washed away in the process. To see if this plan was working, samples of paint, rust, and other target ship surface materials were taken back to a laboratory on the support ship &quot;Haven&quot; and examined for plutonium. The tests showed that the plan was not working. The results of these plutonium detection tests, and of tests performed on fish caught in the lagoon, caused all decontamination work to be abruptly terminated on August 10, effectively shutting down Operation Crossroads for safety reasons. Tests conducted on the support ship in November indicated the presence of of plutonium, which represented 2,000 tolerable doses.

==Failed &quot;Baker&quot; cleanup and program termination==

The program termination on August 10, sixteen days after &quot;Baker&quot;, was the result of a showdown between Dr. Stafford Warren, the Army colonel in charge of radiation safety for Operation Crossroads, and Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Special Weapons, Vice Admiral William H. P. Blandy. A radiation safety monitor under Warren&#x27;s command later described him as &quot;the only Army colonel who ever sank a Navy flotilla.&quot;

Warren had been chief of the medical section of the Manhattan Project and was in charge of radiation safety at the &quot;Trinity&quot; test, as well as of the on-ground inspections at Hiroshima and Nagasaki after the bombings. At Operation Crossroads, it was his job to keep the sailors safe during the cleanup.

===Radiation monitoring===
A total of 18,875 film badge dosimeters were issued to personnel during the operation. About 6,596 dosimeters were given to personnel who were based on the nearby islands or support ships that had no potential for radiation exposure. The rest were issued to all of the individuals thought to be at the greatest risk for radiological contamination along with a percentage of each group who were working in less contaminated areas. Personnel were removed for one or more days from areas and activities of possible exposure if their badges showed more than 0.1 roentgen (R) per day exposure. Experts believed at the time that this radiation dose could be tolerated by individuals for long periods without any harmful effects. The maximum accumulated dose of 3.72 R was received by a radiation safety monitor.

===Cleanup issues===

The cleanup was hampered by two significant factors: the unexpected base surge and the lack of a viable cleanup plan. It was understood that if the water column fell back into the lagoon, which it did, any ships that were drenched by falling water might be contaminated beyond redemption. Nobody expected that to happen to almost the entire target fleet. No decontamination procedures had been tested to see if they would work and to measure the potential risk to personnel. In the absence of a decontamination protocol, the ships were cleaned using traditional deck-scrubbing methods: hoses, mops, and brushes, with water, soap, and lye. The sailors had no protective clothing.

===Secondary contamination===
By August 3, Colonel Warren concluded the entire effort was futile and dangerous. The unprotected sailors were stirring up radioactive material and contaminating their skin, clothing, and, presumably, their lungs. When they returned to their support ship living quarters, they contaminated the shower stalls, laundry facilities, and everything they touched. Warren demanded an immediate halt to the entire cleanup operation. He was especially concerned about plutonium, which was undetectable on site.

Warren also observed that the radiation safety procedures were not being followed correctly. Fire boats got too close to the target ships they were hosing and drenched their crews with radioactive spray. One fire boat had to be taken out of service. Film badges showed 67 overdoses between August 6 and 9. More than half of the 320 Geiger counters available shorted out and became unavailable. The crews of two target ships, and , moored far from the detonation site, had moved back on board and become overexposed. They were immediately evacuated back to the United States.

Captain L. H. Bibby, commanding officer of the apparently undamaged battleship &quot;New York&quot;, accused Warren&#x27;s radsafe monitors of holding their Geiger counters too close to the deck. He wanted to reboard his ship and sail it home. The steadily dropping radiation counts on the target ships gave an illusion that the cleanup was working, but Warren explained that although fission products were losing some of their gamma ray potency through radioactive decay, the ships were still contaminated. The danger of ingesting microscopic particles remained.
===Warren persuades Blandy===
Blandy ordered Warren to explain his position to 1,400 skeptical officers and sailors. Some found him persuasive, but it was August 9 before he convinced Blandy. That was the date when Blandy realized, for the first time, that Geiger counters could not detect plutonium. Blandy was aware of the health problems of radium dial painters who ingested microscopic amounts of radium in the 1920s, and the fact that plutonium was assumed to have a similar biological effect. When plutonium was discovered in the captain&#x27;s quarters of &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;, unaccompanied by fission products, Blandy realized that plutonium could be anywhere.

The following day, August 10, Warren showed Blandy an autoradiograph of a fish, an x-ray picture made by radiation coming from the fish. The outline of the fish was made by alpha radiation from the fish scales, evidence that plutonium, mimicking calcium, had been distributed throughout the fish, out to the scales. Blandy announced his decision, &quot;then we call it all to a halt.&quot; He ordered that all further decontamination work be discontinued. Warren wrote home, &quot;A self x ray of a fish ... did the trick.&quot;

The decontamination failure ended plans to outfit some of the target ships for the 1947 &quot;Charlie&quot; shot and to sail the rest home in triumph. The immediate public relations problem was to avoid any perception that the entire target fleet had been destroyed. On August 6, in anticipation of this development, Blandy had told his staff that ships sunk or destroyed more than 30 days after the &quot;Baker&quot; shot &quot;will not be considered as sunk by the bomb.&quot; By then, public interest in Operation Crossroads was waning, and the reporters had gone home. The failure of decontamination did not make news until the final reports came out a year later.

==Test &quot;Charlie&quot;==
Testing program staff originally set test &quot;Charlie&quot; for early 1947. They wanted to explode it deep under the surface in the lee of the atoll to test the effect of nuclear weapons as depth charges on unmoored ships. The unanticipated delays in decontaminating the target ships after test &quot;Baker&quot; prevented the required technical support personnel from assisting with &quot;Charlie&quot; and also meant that there were no uncontaminated target ships available for use in &quot;Charlie&quot;. The naval weapons program staff decided the test was less pressing given that the entire U.S. arsenal had only a handful of nuclear weapons and canceled the test. The official reason given for canceling &quot;Charlie&quot; was that the program staff felt it was unnecessary because of the success of the &quot;Able&quot; and &quot;Baker&quot; tests. The deep ocean effects testing that &quot;Charlie&quot; was to have performed were fulfilled nine years later with &quot;Operation Wigwam&quot;.

==Aftermath==

All ships leak and require the regular operation of bilge pumps to stay afloat. If their bilge pumps could not be operated, the target ships would eventually sink. Only one suffered this fate: &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;, which sank in the Kwajalein lagoon on December 22. The rest were kept afloat long enough to be deliberately sunk or dismantled. After the August 10 decision to stop decontamination work at Bikini, the surviving target fleet was towed to Kwajalein Atoll where the live ammunition and fuel could be offloaded in uncontaminated water. The move was accomplished during the remainder of August and September.

Eight of the major ships and two submarines were towed back to the United States and Hawaii for radiological inspection. Twelve target ships were so lightly contaminated that they were remanned and sailed back to the United States by their crews. Ultimately, only nine target ships were able to be scrapped rather than scuttled. The remaining target ships were scuttled off Bikini or Kwajalein Atolls, or near the Hawaiian Islands or the California coast during 1946–1948. The remains of were retained at Hunters Point Shipyard until 1951 to test decontamination methods.

The support ships were decontaminated as necessary and received a radiological clearance before they could return to the fleet. This required a great deal of experimentation at Navy shipyards in the United States, primarily in San Francisco at Hunters Point. The destroyer required &quot;sandblasting and painting of all underwater surfaces, and acid washing and partial replacement of salt-water piping and evaporators.&quot;

A survey was conducted in mid-1947 to study long-term effects of the Operation Crossroads tests. According to the official report, decontamination efforts &quot;revealed conclusively that removal of radioactive contamination of the type encountered in the target vessels in test &quot;Baker&quot; cannot be accomplished successfully.&quot;

On August 11, 1947, &quot;Life&quot; summarized the report in a 14-page article with 33 pictures. The article states, &quot;If all the ships at Bikini had been fully manned, the Baker Day bomb would have killed 35,000 crewmen. If such a bomb were dropped below New York&#x27;s Battery in a stiff south wind, 2 million people would die.&quot;

The contamination problem was not widely appreciated by the general public until 1948, when &quot;No Place to Hide&quot;, a best-selling book by David Bradley, was serialized in the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;, condensed by the &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, and selected by the Book of the Month Club. In his preface, Bradley, a key member of the Radiological Safety Section at Bikini known as the &quot;Geiger men&quot;, asserted that &quot;the accounts of the actual explosions, however well intended, were liberally seasoned with fantasy and superstition, and the results of the tests have remained buried in the vaults of military security.&quot; His description of the &quot;Baker&quot; test and its aftermath brought to world attention the problem of radioactive fallout from nuclear weapons.

=== Personnel exposure ===

All Operation Crossroads operations were designed to keep personnel from being exposed to more than 0.1 roentgen (R) per day. At the time, this was considered to be an amount of radiation that could be tolerated for long periods without any harmful effects on health. Since there was no special clothing or radiation shielding available, the protection plan relied on managing who went where, when, and for how long.

Radioactively &quot;hot&quot; areas were predicted and then checked with Geiger counters, sometimes by remote control, to see if they were safe. The level of measured gamma radiation determined how long personnel could operate in them without exceeding the allowable daily dose. Instant gamma readings were taken by radiation safety specialists, but film-badge dosimeters, which could be read at the end of the day, were issued to all personnel believed to be at the greatest radiological risk. Anyone whose badge showed more than 0.1 R per day exposure was removed for one or more days from areas and activities of possible exposure. The maximum accumulated exposure recorded was 3.72 R, received by a radiation safety specialist.

A percentage of each group working in less contaminated areas was badged. Eventually, 18,875 film-badge dosimeters were issued to about 15% of the total work force. On the basis of this sampling, a theoretical total exposure was calculated for each person who did not have a personal badge. As expected, exposures for target ship crewmen who boarded their ships after &quot;Baker&quot; were higher than those for support ship crews. The hulls of support ships that entered the lagoon after &quot;Baker&quot; became so radioactive that sleeping quarters were moved toward the center of each ship. Of the total mass of radioactive particles scattered by each explosion, 85% was unfissioned plutonium which produces alpha radiation not detected by film badges or Geiger counters. There was no method of detecting plutonium in a timely fashion, and participants were not monitored for ingestion of it.

A summary of film badge readings (in roentgens) for July and August, when the largest number of personnel was involved, is listed below:

Service members who participated in the cleanup of contaminated ships were exposed to unknown amounts of radiation. In 1996, a government-sponsored mortality study of Operation Crossroads veterans showed that, by 1992, 46 years after the tests, veterans had experienced a 4.6% higher mortality than a control group of non-veterans. There were 200 more deaths among Operation Crossroads veterans than in the similar control group (12,520 vs. 12,320), implying a life-span reduction of about three months for Operation Crossroads veterans. Veterans who were exposed to radiation formed the non-profit National Association of Atomic Veterans in 1978 to lobby for veterans benefits covering illnesses they believed were caused by their exposure.

Legislation was passed in 1988 that removed the need for veterans to prove a causal link between certain forms of cancer and radiation exposure due to nuclear tests. Incidence of the main expected causes of this increased mortality, leukemia and other cancers, was not significantly higher than normal. Death by those diseases was tabulated on the assumption that if radiation exposure had a life-shortening effect it would likely show up there, but it did not. Not enough data were gathered on other causes of death to determine the reason for this increase in all-cause mortality, and it remains a mystery. The mortality increase was higher, 5.7%, for those who boarded target ships after the tests than for those who did not, whose mortality increase was 4.3%.

=== Bikini Atoll ===
The 167 Bikini residents who were moved to the Rongerik Atoll prior to the Crossroads tests were unable to gather sufficient food or catch enough fish and shellfish to feed themselves in their new environment. The Navy left food and water for a few weeks and then failed to return in a timely manner. By January 1947, visitors to Rongerik reported the islanders were suffering malnutrition, facing potential starvation by July, and were emaciated by January 1948. In March 1948 they were evacuated to Kwajalein, and then settled onto another uninhabited island, Kili, in November. With only one third of a square mile, Kili has one sixth the land area of Bikini and, more importantly, has no lagoon and no protected harbor. Unable to practice their native culture of lagoon fishing, they became dependent on food shipments. Their 4,000 descendants today are living on several islands and in foreign countries.

Their desire to return to Bikini was thwarted indefinitely by the U.S. decision to resume nuclear testing at Bikini in 1954. During 1954, 1956, and 1958, 21 more nuclear bombs were detonated at Bikini, yielding a total of , equivalent to more than 3,000 &quot;Baker&quot; bombs. Only one was an air burst, the 3.8 megaton Redwing &quot;Cherokee&quot; test. Air bursts distribute fallout in a large area, but surface bursts produce intense local fallout. The first after Crossroads was the dirtiest: the 15 megaton &quot;Bravo&quot; shot of Operation Castle on March 1, 1954, which was the largest-ever U.S. test. Fallout from &quot;Bravo&quot; caused radiation injury to Bikini islanders who were living on Rongelap Atoll.

The brief attempt to resettle Bikini from 1972 until 1978 was aborted when health problems from radioactivity in the food supply caused the atoll to be evacuated again. Sport divers who visit Bikini to dive on the shipwrecks must eat imported food. The local government elected to close the fly-in fly-out sports diving operation in Bikini lagoon in 2008, and the 2009 diving season was canceled due to fuel costs, unreliable airline service to the island, and a decline in the Bikini Islanders&#x27; trust fund which subsidized the operation. After a successful trial in October 2010, the local government licensed a sole provider of dive expeditions on the nuclear ghost fleet at Bikini Atoll starting in 2011. The aircraft carrier is the primary attraction of a struggling, high-end sport diving industry.

==Legacy==

Following test &quot;Baker&quot; decontamination problems, the United States Navy equipped newly constructed ships with a Countermeasure Wash Down System of piping and nozzles to cover exterior surfaces of the ship with a spray of salt water from the firefighting system when nuclear attack appeared imminent. The film of flowing water would theoretically prevent contaminants from settling into cracks and crevices.

==In popular culture==

The juxtaposition of half-naked islanders with nuclear weapons that had the power to reduce everyone to a primitive state provided some with an inspirational motif. During Operation Crossroads, Paris swimwear designer Louis Réard adopted the name &quot;Bikini&quot; for his minimalist swimsuit design which, revolutionary for the time, exposed the wearer&#x27;s navel. He explained that &quot;like the bomb, the bikini is small and devastating&quot;. Fashion writer Diana Vreeland described the bikini as the &quot;atom bomb of fashion&quot;. While two-piece swimsuits have been used since antiquity, it was Réard&#x27;s name of the &quot;Bikini&quot; that stuck for all of its modern incarnations.

Artist Bruce Conner made &quot;Crossroads&quot;, a 1976 video assembled from the official films, with an audio collage fashioned by Patrick Gleeson on a Moog synthesizer and a drone composition performed on an electric organ by Terry Riley. A commentator at &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; called the experience of watching the video the &quot;nuclear sublime.&quot;

Films and TV shows have used archive footage of the test &quot;Baker&quot; explosion in a fictitious capacity. In the animated comedy series &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, the footage is used three times; in the season 2 episode &quot;Dying for Pie&quot;, in the season 5 episode &quot;The Krusty Plate&quot;, and in the season 8 episode &quot;Frozen Face-Off&quot;. One film example, TriStar Pictures&#x27; &quot;Godzilla&quot; from 1998, uses the &quot;Baker&quot; test footage in the film&#x27;s opening to depict the atomic bomb responsible for the creation of the titular monster. In &quot;Godzilla Minus One&quot;, Operation Crossroads was the cause of Godzilla&#x27;s mutation in the first place, with the film&#x27;s novelisation elaborating that &quot;Baker&quot; was the specific detonation responsible. The test &quot;Baker&quot; explosion archival footage is also used in the Stanley Kubrick film &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;. The footage plays during the ending montage of the movie accompanied by Vera Lynn singing &quot;We&#x27;ll Meet Again&quot;.

<text>The Expedition of Humphry Clinker was the last of the picaresque novels of Tobias Smollett, published in London on 17 June 1771 (three months before Smollett&#x27;s death), and is considered by many to be his best and funniest work. It is an epistolary novel, presented in the form of letters written by six characters: Matthew Bramble, a Welsh Squire; his sister Tabitha; their niece Lydia and nephew Jeremy Melford; Tabitha&#x27;s maid Winifred Jenkins; and Lydia&#x27;s suitor Wilson.

Much of the comedy arises from differences in the descriptions of the same events and places seen by the participants. Attributions of motives and descriptions of behaviour show wild variation and reveal much about the character of the teller. The setting, amidst the high-society spa towns, inns, and seaside resorts of the 18th century, provides his characters with many opportunities for satirical observations on English and Scottish life, manners, and politics. Smollett relies heavily on a scatological humour and references to the body. The net effect re-creates the messiness of eighteenth-century British novels that relied on the epistolary form.

The author&#x27;s travels in Scotland, France, and Italy influenced his novel.

==Plot summary==
Matthew Bramble, his family and servants are traveling through England and Scotland. Although the primary motivation for the expedition is to restore the health of the gouty Matthew Bramble, each member of the family uses the excursion to achieve their ends. Leaving from Bramble&#x27;s estate, Brambleton Hall, in Monmouthshire (there are frequent references to the family being Welsh, and the novel also contains individual Scottish and Irish characters), the family passes through many cities, making extended or significant stops at Gloucester, Bath, London, Harrogate, Scarborough and Edinburgh.

The splenetic patriarch, Matthew Bramble, visits various natural spas to alleviate his health problems, and he corresponds primarily with his physician, Dr. Lewis. Through his letters and those of Jeremy, it is revealed that Bramble is misanthropic and something of a hypochondriac. Despite his frequent complaints, he is generally reasonable and extremely charitable to the people he meets on his travels as well as to his servants and wards back at home. His letters introduce and ridicule significant eighteenth century concerns such as medicine, the growth of urban life, class, the growth of the periodical press and the public sphere. His growing disillusionment at the changing moral and social landscape of Great Britain, particularly London, embodies his traditionalist perspective and reveals the absurdities of contemporary British culture.

His sister, Tabitha Bramble, is a foolish and cantankerous spinster who uses the expedition as an excuse to search for a husband. Through her correspondence with Mrs. Gwyllim, the house-keeper at Brambleton Hall, Tabitha reveals her selfishness and lack of generosity towards servants and the impoverished. Her social pretensions are rendered all the more comical by her frequent misunderstandings, misuse of common idioms, and atrocious spelling.

Tabitha&#x27;s servant, Winifred or Win Jenkins, also corresponds with the servants at Brambleton Hall. As the only correspondent not related to Matthew Bramble, Ms. Jenkins offers a sympathetic and humorous perspective on the family and their travels. As a comic foil to Tabitha Bramble, Win Jenkins shares many of her misspellings and malapropisms but demonstrates considerably more common sense and intuition in her observation of the family. At London, she becomes infatuated with Humphry Clinker and Methodism both.

Bramble&#x27;s nephew, Jeremy Melford, is a young man looking for amusement. Corresponding primarily with Sir Watkin Phillips of Jesus College, Oxford, Jery also reflects upon issues of city life, class, and the growing public sphere, but often with a more progressive perspective than that of his rather traditional uncle. Despite his generously democratic views and his astute perceptions of the hypocrisy and absurdity of others, he is—as revealed through Bramble&#x27;s letters—&quot;hot-headed&quot; and prone to rash anger and impulsive defenses of perceived slights to his family honor, especially when it relates to his sister&#x27;s interest in a stage actor below her status. His introduction into society as a young gentleman often occurs during his socializing at the coffeehouse, a burgeoning social institution, especially in eighteenth century London. His study of the places and people of his journey includes the members of his family, whom he comically sketches for the reader. His accounts help provide insight into Matthew Bramble&#x27;s character.

Bramble&#x27;s niece, Lydia Melford, is trying to recover from an unfortunate romantic entanglement with a stage actor named Wilson, who is later revealed to be a gentleman named George Dennison. Her letters to Miss Letitia Willis at Gloucester reveal her struggles between familial duty and her affection for Wilson. She describes her secret communications with him, as well as her surprise encounter with the disguised Wilson in Bath. Lydia also reflects upon the wonders of city life, with astonishment and excitement. Lydia has spent most of her life at a boarding school for young women, so the expedition serves her as a debut into society (an important cultural phenomenon with a long literary tradition).

The eponymous character, Humphry Clinker, is an ostler, a stableman at an inn, who does not make his first appearance until about a quarter of the way through the story. He is taken on by Matthew Bramble and family, while they are traveling toward London, after offending Tabitha and amusing Matthew Bramble. Humphry Clinker is a primarily foolish character whose good-natured earnestness earns him the esteem of Matthew Bramble. He is largely described through the letters of Matthew Bramble and Jeremy Melford and, despite his frequent misunderstandings, is presented as a talented worker and gifted orator, attracting a devoted following of parishioners during a brief oratorical stint in London. After various romantic interludes, Humphry suffers false imprisonment due to accusations of being a highway robber, though he retains the confident support of Matthew Bramble and his family. He is rescued and returned to his sweetheart, the maid Winifred Jenkins. Eventually, it is discovered that Humphry is Mr. Bramble&#x27;s illegitimate son from a relationship with a barmaid, during his wilder university days. The book ends in a series of weddings.

==Adaptations==

<text>Ripley is a market town and civil parish in the Amber Valley district of Derbyshire, England, northeast of Derby, northwest of Heanor, southwest of Alfreton and northeast of Belper. The town is continuous with Heanor, Eastwood and Ilkeston as part of the wider Nottingham Urban Area.

==History==
Little information remains as to when Ripley was founded, but it appears in the 1086 Domesday Book, when it was held by a man called Levenot. In 1251 Henry III granted a charter for &quot;one market one day a week, on Wednesday, at [the] manor of Ryppeleg: and one fair each year lasting three days, on the Vigil Day and Morrow of St Helen&quot;. Ripley Fair antedates Nottingham Goose Fair. The market day was later altered to Saturdays, with an extra market on Fridays. Medieval Ripley was just a few stone cottages and farms around a village green, with a few dwellings further afield. Corn was ground at a mill owned by the Abbot of Darley. In 1291, Ripley had &quot;two water-mills with fish ponds&quot;.

The Ripley area has been industrialised since the late 18th century. One of the earliest firms to take advantage of local mineral resources was the Butterley Company. It was formed in 1790 by Benjamin Outram and Francis Beresford. Jessop and Wright joined as partners in 1791. Benjamin Outram and Jessop were pioneering engineers best known for their input into the rail industry and their engineering of the Cromford Canal. Outram developed the L-shaped flange rail and Jessop engineered the cast iron fish belly rail. The Little Eaton Gangway project was one of the engineering feats they completed. The engineering part of the company closed and the site of the Butterley Company was demolished in 2010. The company was latterly in three parts, Butterley Engineering, Butterley Brick and Butterley Aggregates as separate companies. Over the last 200 years these have dealt with steelworks, coal mining, quarrying, railway, foundry and brickworks. One of the best-known examples of the company&#x27;s work is the arched roof of St Pancras railway station in London, restored as an international terminal. Post-2000 Butterley achievements were the design and construction of the Falkirk Wheel, a canal boat-lift funded by the Millennium Commission and the Spinnaker Tower seen in Portsmouth Harbour as the focus of its regeneration.

Ripley was also a mining community, with collieries owned by the Butterley Company until the Coal Industry Nationalisation Act 1946. These included Ripley colliery (1863–1948), Brittain colliery (1918–1946), Ormonde 1908–1970, and other pits at Upper and Lower Hartshay, Whiteley, Waingroves, Bailey Brook, Exhibition, Loscoe, New Langley and Denby Hall.

==Governance==

What is now Ripley Town Hall on the north side of the Market Place was erected in 1880 as a market hall. The architect was George Eyre of Codnor. It occupied the site of a much older dwelling known as The White House. The Market Hall was originally open on the ground floor. In 1907, it was converted into a Town Hall by the Urban District Council. In the 1990s, the building was much extended to the west and remodelled by Amber Valley Borough Council to form its headquarters. In 2012, the Council proposed to sell off some of the buildings under a rationalisation scheme.

==Demography==
According to the 2021 census, Ripley&#x27;s population was recorded at 20,176. The ethnic makeup of the town was recorded at 98% White British out of 19,703 residents, followed by Mixed Race at 1% out of 231 residents and 1% Asian out of 135 residents. The other ethnic groups made up less than 1% of the local population. In terms of religious makeup, Ripley&#x27;s residents were recorded to be mostly non-religious at 51% of the local population at 9,696 residents followed by 48% of the towns residents identifying as Christian out of 9.044 residents. Other religions practiced in Ripley include Other religion (121 residents), Islam (57 residents) and Buddhism (57 residents). The town has a high ratio of Women compared to Men at 51% (Women) and 49% (Male).

==Religion==
The Methodist Church in Wood Street is reputed to be the oldest church in the town that is still active. At the peak of the movement there were five Methodist churches in Ripley, but the congregations combined over the years. The church was rebuilt on the same site and reopened in November 2009. See History of Methodism in Ripley Derbyshire

An outcome of the nearby Pentridge (or Pentrich) Rising of 1817 was for the Vicar of Pentrich Church to call for an Anglican church to be built in Ripley as soon as possible. All Saints&#x27; Church, Ripley was erected in 1821 by the Butterley Company.

Other places of worship include the Salvation Army hall in Heath Road, which was opened in 1911, the Springs of the Living Water housed in the former St John&#x27;s Church in Derby Road, the Spiritual Church in Argyll Road, and Marehay Methodist Chapel in Warmwells Lane, Marehay.

==Transport==
Running under the premises of the Butterley Company is the Butterley Tunnel on the Cromford Canal. The central section of the canal is disused, but a charitable fund has been formed to reopen it.

Ripley is the site of Midland Railway – Butterley (formerly the Midland Railway Centre), a trust dedicated to preserving railway locomotives, rolling stock and other items related to the Midland Railway.

Ripley was once served by Ripley railway station on the Midland Railway Ripley Branch. It was the northern terminus of the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Tramways Company and later of the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire trolleybus system.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC East Midlands and ITV Central. Television signals are received from the Waltham TV transmitter.

Ripley&#x27;s local radio stations are BBC Radio Derby on 104.5 FM, Smooth East Midlands on 101.4 FM, Capital East Midlands on 102.8 FM, Greatest Hits Radio Midlands on 106 FM and Amber Sound FM, a community station which is based in the Unicorn Business Park off Wellington Street. The station broadcasts on 107.2FM in the Amber Valley and online.

Local newspapers are the &quot;Ripley &amp; Heanor News&quot; and &quot;Derbyshire Times&quot;. 

==Parks and natural features==
Butterley Reservoir, at the bottom of Butterley Hill in the north of the town, has pairs of great crested grebe, coot, moorhens and other birds to watch, and platforms for anglers to use. There is a footpath that takes in the scenery, with the Midland Railway Trust in the background.

Wildlife and a small woodland area can be enjoyed at Carr Wood, signposted from halfway down Butterley Hill.

At the bottom of Moseley Street, next to the Red Lion pub in Ripley Town Centre, is a recreation area named after Sir Barnes Wallis, which offers views over to Crich Stand, the Sherwood Foresters Memorial. Crich Stand was built by Francis Hurt in 1778 and in 1922 dedicated to the fallen of the Sherwood Foresters Regiment (colloquially known as the Woofers) in World War I. It is now the memorial for those in the Regiment who died in all conflicts.

The Pit Top is an open area with some seating and a white arch sculpture. The grassed area is the site of the original Ripley Colliery, owned by Butterley Company and worked from 1863 until 1948.

Crossley Park is a few acres of grassed land opened in 1935. It is surrounded by shrubs and trees on a tract given to the town by James Crossley in 1901. It has a children&#x27;s play area with a paddling pool, a paved perimeter walk, and a bandstand used as such occasionally on late Sunday afternoons in the summer.

==Twin towns==
Ripley is twinned with the French towns of Château-Renault and Lons-le-Saunier.

==Community and facilities==
The headquarters of Derbyshire Constabulary is on the outskirts of Ripley at Butterley Hall.

Ripley has a community hospital with a minor accident and emergency department that opened on 7 September 1912. The hospital was built after the death of a miner injured at Pentrich Colliery, who did not survive the road journey to Derby in time for treatment. The Ripley Hospital League of Friends has been an active fund-raising group for the hospital throughout its history.

Ripley has a Scout group founded in 1914. For younger children it has two Beaver colonies and a Cub pack.

The Ripley Music Festival has been held in the town since 2001.

<text>Miles &quot;Tails&quot; Prower is a character created by Japanese game designer Yasushi Yamaguchi. Part of Sega&#x27;s &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; franchise, he is the first character to consistently appear by Sonic&#x27;s side in the series, appearing in nearly every mainline and spin-off game since his debut. His role as Sonic&#x27;s best friend and sidekick is analogous to Luigi from the &quot;Mario&quot; series. The name &quot;Miles Prower&quot; is a pun on &quot;miles per hour&quot;, a reference to the famed speed of Sonic the Hedgehog. Prower is a two-tailed anthropomorphic fox cub, hence the nickname.

Tails made his debut in November 1992 in both the 8-bit &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot; for the Sega Master System &amp; Game Gear, and the separate but identically-titled 16-bit game &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot; for the Sega Genesis / Mega Drive. Yamaguchi designed Tails as part of an internal competition to create a character to serve as a sidekick to Sonic. When his entry won, Sonic Team wanted to name the fox Miles Prower; Sega of America resisted, presenting the name Tails at a board meeting, along with a backstory for the character highlighting the name, to convince Sonic Team to acquiesce. A compromise was eventually reached, leaving Miles Prower as the fox&#x27;s name and Tails as his nickname.

Tails is characterized in &quot;Sonic&quot; media as a good-natured mechanical genius and skilled pilot, possessing the ability to fly by spinning his tails similarly to the rotor blades on a helicopter rotor. Most media depicts him as having been bullied for his intelligence and twin tails, until he met and befriended Sonic; he looks up to Sonic as a role model and desires to be like him, though he later realizes he must stand up for himself and becomes his own hero. Outside the &quot;Sonic&quot; platform games, Tails has starred in &quot;Tails and the Music Maker&quot; for the Sega Pico, and &quot;Tails Adventure&quot; and &quot;Tails&#x27; Skypatrol&quot; for the Game Gear. Atsuki Murata and Ryō Hirohashi have voiced Tails in Japan, while Colleen O&#x27;Shaughnessey has provided his English voice since 2014. O&#x27;Shaughnessey reprised her role for the live-action film franchise distributed by Paramount Pictures.

Tails has received positive reception since his debut, with critics naming him as being among the most iconic sidekicks in gaming. Tails&#x27; likeness has been adapted in merchandise, as well as almost all &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; related media, spanning comic books, TV shows, and films.

==Concept and creation==

Yasushi Yamaguchi, originally the main artist and zone designer for Sega&#x27;s Sonic Team, designed Tails for an internal competition for a sidekick to Sonic. The character was inspired by a kitsune, a creature from Japanese folklore that could over time grow multiple tails. The character was also meant to hold a &quot;deep admiration for Sonic&quot;.

While Yamaguchi&#x27;s entry won, Sega of Japan wanted to name the character &quot;Miles Prower&quot; (the surname being a play on &quot;per hour&quot;), whereas the American subsidiary Sega of America preferred the moniker &quot;Tails&quot;. Sega of America crafted a compelling backstory for the character to convince the Japanese parent company and Sonic Team to have him named &quot;Tails&quot;. Yamaguchi ended up with a compromise, using &quot;Miles Prower&quot; as the character&#x27;s real name; &quot;Tails&quot; would be his nickname, giving the character the full name of Miles &quot;Tails&quot; Prower.

The character debuted as Sonic&#x27;s tag-along partner in the franchise&#x27;s second game and has remained an important character since. However, the character&#x27;s uniqueness was not established until &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot;, when players were given the power to control his flying (although the AI would make Tails fly when he would get off-screen).

Tails was redesigned (along with all of the other &quot;Sonic&quot; characters) by Yuji Uekawa for &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;. His fur changed color to a more yellow shade as opposed to the orange in his early appearances, and he gained blue irises. In the American &quot;Sonic&quot; comic book, along with the &quot;Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; and &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; cartoons, he was originally brown, as the only color reference of Tails provided to DIC Entertainment by Sega of America was an early sprite of Tails, which depicted him with a burnt orange color scheme; the comic artists and cartoon artists eventually decided to change Tails&#x27; fur color to match his in-game appearance.

===Voice portrayal===

Throughout the years, Tails has been voiced by several different voice actors. In the Japanese dubs, Tails was voiced by Hekiru Shiina in 1996, Kazuki Hayashi in 1998, Atsuki Murata from 2000 to 2001 and by Ryō Hirohashi since 2003.

On &quot;Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, Tails was originally voiced by Russi Taylor in the unaired pilot, Christopher Stephen Welch would later take over and voice the character throughout the entire series, excluding the Christmas special where he was voiced by Chris Turner. He was then voiced by Bradley Pierce in &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; and then by Lainie Frasier in &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie&quot;. Corey Bringas would voice Tails in &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;. His brother, Connor Bringas, would voice Tails in &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot;. William Corkery would then take over in &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot;.

Beginning in 2003 with the &quot;Sonic X&quot; anime series, he was voiced by Amy Palant who would later take over the role in the video games, starting with &quot;Shadow the Hedgehog&quot; in 2005. Palant was replaced by Kate Higgins in 2010, beginning with &quot;Sonic Free Riders&quot;. She continued to voice the character until 2013, where her final role as Tails was in &quot;Mario &amp; Sonic at the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games&quot;, though she reprised her role in 2021 for the &quot;Sonic Colors: Rise of the Wisps&quot; miniseries. Since 2014, Tails has been voiced by Colleen O&#x27;Shaughnessey, including in the television series &quot;Sonic Boom&quot; and the live-action films. In the 2022 Sonic short film, &quot;Sonic Drone Home&quot;, Tails is voiced by Alicyn Packard. In the Netflix series &quot;Sonic Prime&quot;, Tails is voiced by Ashleigh Ball.

==Characteristics==
The character of Tails is portrayed as a very sweet-natured, gentle, kind, comforting, and humble fox. As a longtime friend, he admires Sonic and dreams of being just like him. He wants to prove that he can be counted on, and has fought Dr. Eggman and his robots without the aid of Sonic before. He is fond of mint candy. Despite overcoming most of his fears and becoming very bold, Tails remains keraunophobic. Tails is not intended to be a selfish character and instead, is always ready and willing to help others without asking for anything in return.

Tails has been described as a mechanical prodigy who rivals Dr. Eggman but has not yet realized his full potential. Coupled with his skills as an airplane pilot, he uses a biplane nicknamed &quot;Tornado&quot; to assist Sonic on their adventures. Additionally, by spinning his two tails like a helicopter rotor, he has the unique ability to push himself through the air to catch up with Sonic; however, this tires him quickly, hence his use of planes. Unlike Sonic, Tails can swim. Like Sonic, he can transform into Super Tails, but he requires either the Chaos Emeralds (Sonic Mania) or the Super Emeralds (Sonic 3 and Knuckles) to transform. Also, when in this form (in &quot;Sonic 3 and Knuckles&quot; only), a swarm of Flickies circle Tails. This was seen first as what seemed to be a one-time appearance in &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3 &amp; Knuckles&quot; and then again in &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot;, where alongside Team Sonic members Sonic and Knuckles, would transform themselves into their super forms.

==Appearances==
===In video games===
Tails debuted in November 1992 with the release of &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot;, playing the part of Sonic&#x27;s sidekick. He was a playable character from the second controller and could be chosen as player one for the main game, though he did not possess the ability to fly. He made his second appearance on the Game Gear/Master System-controlled game &quot;Sonic Chaos&quot; (1993), where the player could control Tails and the first time the player could control his flight. Tails also made a minor cameo in &quot;Sonic CD&quot; for the Sega CD, appearing in the debug mode unlock screen. Tails makes an appearance alongside Sonic in the little-known arcade game, SegaSonic Popcorn Shop, a Japanese arcade game which also dispenses popcorn after playing the game.

Tails made his third major appearance in the 1994 game &quot;Sonic 3&quot; (along with a game simultaneously developed, &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot;), with the ability to pick up Sonic and use his tails to fly him to other areas rotating his tails like a helicopter. He also gained the ability to swim underwater, something Sonic has never been able to do. This is also the first time the player could control Tails&#x27; flight in a Sega Genesis game. Tails has also starred in games without Sonic, such as &quot;Tails&#x27; Skypatrol&quot;, which is a side-scrolling score attack-like game for the Game Gear released exclusively in Japan. This was followed by &quot;Tails Adventure&quot; later the same year, which is a &quot;Metroid&quot;-esque platformer with RPG elements. Tails is also the star of &quot;Tails and the Music Maker&quot; for the Sega Pico.

In later games, Tails had roles that require unique modes of play including &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;, where he appears as one of the six playable characters. His gameplay is based around standard platforming stages, but the goal of each stage is to race against Sonic or Eggman to get to the goal first. In &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot;, he is featured in third-person-shooting segments, seated in his &quot;Cyclone&quot; mech. These stages, along with Dr. Eggman&#x27;s shooting levels in the same game, were very similar to the E-102 Gamma levels of &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;. In &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;, he was given a theme song &quot;Believe In Myself&quot;, of which another version appeared in &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot;.

Tails also appeared either as a playable character or in a supporting role in many later &quot;Sonic&quot; titles and still often resumes his role flying other characters around, such as in &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot;, where Tails appears on Team Sonic as their flight-type character, being capable of carrying both Sonic and Knuckles the Echidna. He is the third character the player unlocks in &quot;Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood&quot;, where he acts as a team medic.

Tails appears in &quot;Sonic Unleashed&quot;, where he helps Sonic restore the shattered planet, largely by flying Sonic from continent to continent in the game. He also takes a supporting role in &quot;Sonic and the Black Knight&quot;, portrayed as a local blacksmith who helps players craft goods from the items Sonic collects. Tails appears as a playable character in all of the &quot;Mario &amp; Sonic&quot; titles, as well as in &quot;Sega Superstars Tennis&quot;, &quot;Sonic &amp; Sega All-Stars Racing&quot;, and &quot;Transformed&quot;. He also appears in &quot;Sonic Colors&quot; as a non-playable character.

Tails celebrates Sonic&#x27;s birthday along with his friends by setting up a party in &quot;Sonic Generations&quot;, but when the Time Eater appears, it warps them through various time holes, sending Tails to Green Hill. After Sonic frees him, Tails meets his classic counterpart (Classic Tails) and concludes that they were traveling through time and space. They accompany both Sonics throughout the game, later discovering that Eggman and Robotnik are controlling the Time Eater. Both Classic and Modern Tails, along with all of Sonic&#x27;s friends, help motivate the 2 Sonics to defeat the Time Eater.

The feature to play as Tails was added to the 2011 enhanced port of &quot;Sonic CD&quot;. He later appeared as a co-op character in the second episode of &quot;Sonic 4&quot;. Tails was added as a playable character in the enhanced port of &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; released in 2013 for mobile devices, and also allowed players to opt for the &quot;Sonic and Tails&quot; mode as well.

Sonic and Tails end up facing a group of villains allied with Dr. Eggman, called the Deadly Six when they are shot down while chasing him in the Tornado in &quot;Sonic Lost World&quot;. They run into Eggman and notice him wielding a Cacophonic Conch to control the Deadly Six. Despite Tails&#x27; warnings, Sonic knocks away the conch, causing the Deadly Six to betray him. Eggman reluctantly teams up with Sonic and Tails to stop them. This causes numerous conflicts between Tails and Eggman and increases tension in his friendship with Sonic since Sonic believes Eggman is their only hope in defeating the Deadly Six. Eventually, Tails gets captured in a trap intended for Sonic, and the Deadly Six plan to use this to their advantage by turning Tails into a robot. However, Tails manages to reprogram the computer that would control his mind. The seemingly-robotized Tails confronts Sonic at the game&#x27;s final stage, but by retaining his free will, he takes the Deadly Six by surprise and attacks them. Later on, after Sonic defeats Eggman at the game&#x27;s climax, Sonic apologizes to Tails for doubting him. Tails forgives him and the two return home.

He is a playable character in the 2017 video game &quot;Sonic Mania Plus&quot;, playing like his older incarnations along with Sonic, Knuckles, Mighty, and Ray. He also appears as a playable character in the &quot;Sonic Boom&quot;-themed games &quot;Rise of Lyric&quot;, &quot;Shattered Crystal&quot; and &quot;Fire &amp; Ice&quot;. Tails appears as one of 12 playable characters in the 2019 kart racing game &quot;Team Sonic Racing&quot; as well. 

Tails was also featured in the Sonic the Hedgehog Level Pack of &quot;Lego Dimensions&quot;. He is also playable if the player uses the Tornado as Sonic to fly around the world. In the story mode for the Sonic level titled &quot;Sonic Dimensions&quot;, Tails assists Sonic using the Tornado and his technological knowledge. In the hub world, Tails has a side quest for the player to aid him in disabling all of Eggman&#x27;s roboticists. Tails is a supporting non-playable character in &quot;Sonic Forces&quot;, finding Classic Sonic and joining up with the resistance in opposing Dr. Eggman and Infinite.

In &quot;Sonic Frontiers&quot;, Tails along with Amy and Knuckles are trapped in Cyberspace, with Sonic releasing their digital form from cages and they help him find the Chaos Emeralds and set them free. While having a moment with Sonic, Tails expresses his self-doubt and belief that he is a burden to Sonic who is always rescuing him during crises, and that his helpfulness is wildly inconsistent, but Sonic comforts him by reminding Tails of his achievements and abilities and needing help sometimes is part of growing up, this strengthens Tails&#x27; resolve to go solo for a while and become a hero in his own right.

He also appears as a downloadable Mii Fighter costume in the crossover fighting games &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U&quot; and &quot;Ultimate&quot;, as well as being featured as a Spirit in the latter. Tails appears as an unlockable playable character in &quot;Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania&quot; and &quot;Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble&quot;.

===In other media===
Tails is a supporting character in the animated series &quot;Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, &quot;Sonic X&quot; and &quot;Sonic Boom&quot;, as well as the 1996 &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; film. Tails also makes a guest appearance in the &quot;OK K.O.! Let&#x27;s Be Heroes&quot; episode &quot;Let&#x27;s Meet Sonic&quot;. Tails appears in the 2020 &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; film during a mid-credits sequence, emerging from a ring portal on Earth in search of Sonic. Tails is featured as a main character in the sequel, &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot;, the logo of which features a yellow &quot;2&quot; with two tails attached in homage to the character. He is voiced by Colleen O&#x27;Shaughnessey, reprising her role from the games. In the film, Tails was shunned on his home planet for having two tails but grew to idolize Sonic after witnessing his bravery when facing off against Dr. Robotnik. He travels to the planet to warn Sonic about Knuckles hunting him down to locate the Master Emerald and teams up with his hero to find the Emerald first. He assists Sonic with his flight and various gadgets throughout their journey, culminating in them teaming up with Knuckles to stop Robotnik from conquering the universe. After they succeed, they agree to safeguard Master Emerald as they live together with Sonic&#x27;s adoptive family, the Wachowskis. Tails also appears in the first episode of &quot;Knuckles&quot;, voiced again by O&#x27;Shaughnessey. In the third movie of film series, &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot;, Tails, once again voiced by O&#x27;Shaughnessey, continues to be the &quot;gadget guy&quot; of Sonic&#x27;s team as they try to stop Shadow the Hedgehog, providing crucial technical help, such as holograms, to aid Sonic.

Tails, and alternative versions of himself, appear in &quot;Sonic Prime&quot;, all of them voiced by Ashleigh Ball, after Sonic shatters the Paradox Prism and the universe, creating alternative dimensions in the process. Several alternative Tails are created, one being Nine, who never met Sonic and was bullied throughout his life. He became bitter and isolated as a result, and created seven artificial tails for himself as weapons. He is initially distrustful of Sonic but eventually warms up to him. Other versions are the feral and seemingly unintelligent Mangey and the pirate mechanic Sails. In print, he is a supporting character in the Comics-produced &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; comic series as well as the Fleetway-produced &quot;Sonic the Comic&quot;.

==Reception==
Tails has received widely positive reception. He was awarded &quot;Best New Character&quot; in &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;″s 1992 video game awards, stating &quot;Not only is he as cute as Sonic, but he serves a major purpose in the game.&quot; &quot;IGN&quot; editor Lucas M. Thompson listed Tails as one of the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; characters who should be in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot;, citing his importance in the series and his abilities. Tails is remembered for helping &quot;Sonic 2&quot; become the highest-selling game for Genesis by allowing a second player to join the game. &quot;IGN&quot; editor Levi Buchanan stated that the fan response to Tails&#x27; introduction was favorable, which led to further introductions such as Knuckles however when Sega noticed the popularity of Tails, and later Knuckles, they &quot;just kept stuffing new faces and names into the game, pulling attention away from their hero&quot;.

Tails has been featured on many lists. &quot;Maximum PC&quot; listed him as their third-greatest sidekick, and &quot;Maxim&quot; listed him as the eighth-most-underrated sidekick. Ranking him as the sixth-greatest, Mashable stated that Tails embodies the definition of a sidekick. Sonic and Tails were together ranked as ninth-greatest video game duo as unlike most &quot;Sonic&quot; characters, Tails has received consistently positive opinions from the &quot;Sonic&quot; fanbase over the years. &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; listed him as number one on their list of cutesy characters they wanted to beat up, stating that while he started as interesting, he led to the creation of other characters who &quot;choked the life out the franchise&quot;. They cited him being a &quot;know-it-all&quot; in later games as to why they hate him so much. &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; listed him as the second-best &quot;Sonic&quot; character. Tails was rated the third-most-popular character in the franchise, behind Sonic and Shadow, in an official poll from Sega in 2009.

<text>Amber Valley is a local government district with borough status in the east of Derbyshire, England, taking its name from the River Amber. Its council is based in Ripley. The district covers a semi-rural area lying to the north of the city of Derby. The district contains four main towns whose economy was based on coal mining and remains to some extent influenced by engineering, distribution and manufacturing, holding for instance the headquarters and production site of Thorntons confectionery.

The House of Commons constituency of Amber Valley is of smaller scope.

The village of Crich and other parts of the district were the setting for ITV drama series &quot;Peak Practice&quot;.

==History==
The district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972 as one of nine districts within Derbyshire. The new district covered the area of five former districts, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Alfreton Urban District
*Belper Rural District
*Belper Urban District
*Heanor Urban District
*Ripley Urban District 
The new district was named Amber Valley, after the River Amber. Amber Valley was granted borough status in 1989, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor.

==Governance==

Amber Valley Borough Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Derbyshire County Council. Most of the district is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
Labour won a majority on the council at the 2023 election, taking control from the Conservatives.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:

===Leadership===
The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in Amber Valley. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 2003 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election and changes of allegiance and a by-election up to May 2024, the composition of the council was:
The next election is due in 2027.

===Premises===
The council is based at Ripley Town Hall, which had been built in 1881 as a market hall and converted to a town hall for the former Ripley Urban District Council in 1907. A modern extension to the west of the building was added in the 1990s.

==Elections==

Since the last boundary changes in 2023 the council has comprised 42 councillors elected from 18 wards, with each ward electing two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

<doc id="227525" wikidata="Q6456693" url="?curid=227525" title="L. Welch Pogue">
<text>Lloyd Welch Pogue (October 21, 1899 – May 10, 2003) was an American aviation attorney and chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board.

==Early life and education==
Pogue was born in Grant, Iowa, on October 21, 1899, the son of Leander Welch Pogue and Myrtle Viola Casey. His mother home-schooled him after chores, and he began traditional schooling in eighth grade. He graduated from Red Oak High School in Red Oak, Iowa, in 1917. He attended Grinnell College and enlisted there in the Student Army Training Corps of the U.S. Army before transferring to the University of Nebraska, where he became president of the student body. After returning to work on the family farm for a while, Pogue received his B.A. from the University of Nebraska in 1924, and his law degree from the University of Michigan Law School in 1926. Later, Pogue received his Doctor of Juridical Science (D.J.S.) from Harvard Law School.

At Harvard Law School, noted law Professor and later United States Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter took Pogue in as a protégé. As a lawyer, Pogue was entranced by Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s trans-Atlantic flight and decided to focus his law career mainly on the &quot;skies&quot;.

==Career==

Pogue joined the Civil Aeronautics Board in 1938. Four years later, he was appointed Chairman by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and he served as Chairman until 1946. During his tenure Pogue helped strike down a plan for a single world airline. He later resumed his law practice before retiring in 1981, after a career of nearly 60 years.

Pogue founded the Washington D.C.-based law firm of Pogue &amp; Neal, which represented several major airlines and other industry clients. In 1967, Pogue &amp; Neal merged with Jones, Day, Cockley, Reavis to become Jones, Day, Reavis &amp; Pogue. Pogue served as Managing Partner of the Washington Office from 1967 to 1979.

Pogue was described by author James Parry as &quot;a name synonymous with the pioneering giants who played a pivotal role in transforming international civil aviation ... into the cohesive global force that it is today ... Pogue is truly a living legend and a founding father of the international civil aviation system.&quot; Parry&#x27;s book, &quot;100 Years of Flight&quot;, was commissioned by the International Civil Aviation Organization, based in Montreal[, Quebec, Canada.

==Personal life==
He married Mary Ellen Edgerton on September 8, 1926, in Aurora, Nebraska. They were married for 75 years until her death in 2001. She was born October 27, 1904, in Fremont, Nebraska, the daughter of Mary Nettie Coe and Frank Eugene Edgerton, a direct descendant of Richard Edgerton, one of the founders of Norwich, Connecticut, and a descendant of Governor William Bradford (1590–1657) of the Plymouth Colony and a passenger on the Mayflower.

Her father was a lawyer, journalist, author and orator and served as the assistant attorney general of Nebraska from 1911 to 1915. She died on September 19, 2001, just days after her and Pogue&#x27;s 75th wedding anniversary, at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center in Baltimore, Maryland. Mary Ellen grew up in Aurora, Nebraska, and spent some of her childhood years in Washington, D.C., and Lincoln, Nebraska.

Mrs. Pogue received her bachelor&#x27;s degree in music from the University of Nebraska at Lincoln in 1926 and was a member of Alpha Phi. They had three sons, Richard Welch Pogue, William Lloyd Pogue, and John Marshall Pogue who assisted his father on many research and writing projects.

Their grandson David Pogue, is an Emmy award-winning technology correspondent, writer and journalist.

His wife&#x27;s brother was Harold Eugene &quot;Doc&quot; Edgerton, a professor of electrical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and credited with transforming the stroboscope from an obscure laboratory instrument into a common device.

==Death==

He died on May 10, 2003, at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. He was 103 years old. He is buried at Quantico National Cemetery.

==Miscellaneous==
In 1994, &quot;Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology&quot; established the L. Welch Pogue Award for Lifetime Achievement in Aviation, naming Pogue its first recipient.

<doc id="227533" wikidata="Q334422" url="?curid=227533" title="Hornet">
<text>Hornets (insects in the genus Vespa) are the largest of the eusocial wasps, and are similar in appearance to yellowjackets, their close relatives. Some species can reach up to in length. They are distinguished from other vespine wasps by the relatively large top margin of the head. Worldwide, 22 species of &quot;Vespa&quot; are recognized. Most species only occur in the tropics of Asia, though the European hornet (&quot;V. crabro&quot;) is widely distributed throughout Europe, Russia, North America, and north-eastern Asia. Wasps native to North America in the genus &quot;Dolichovespula&quot; are commonly referred to as hornets (e.g., baldfaced hornets), but all of them are actually yellowjackets.

Like other social wasps, hornets build communal nests by chewing wood to make a papery pulp. Each nest has one queen, which lays eggs and is attended by workers that, while genetically female, cannot lay fertile eggs. Most species make exposed nests in trees and shrubs, but some (such as &quot;Vespa orientalis&quot;) build their nests underground or in other cavities. In the tropics, these nests may last year-round, but in temperate areas, the nest dies over the winter, with lone queens hibernating in leaf litter or other insulative material until the spring. Male hornets are docile and do not have stingers.

Hornets are often considered pests because they aggressively guard their nesting sites when threatened and their stings can be more dangerous than those of bees.

==Classification==


While taxonomically well defined, some confusion may remain about the differences between hornets and other wasps of the family Vespidae, specifically the yellowjackets, which are members of the same subfamily. Also, a related genus of Asian nocturnal vespines, &quot;Provespa&quot;, is referred to as &quot;night wasps&quot; or &quot;night hornets&quot;, though they are not true hornets.

Some other large wasps are sometimes referred to as hornets, most notably the bald-faced hornet (&quot;Dolichovespula maculata&quot;) found in North America. It is set apart by its black and ivory coloration. The name &quot;hornet&quot; is used for this species primarily because of its habit of making aerial nests (similar to some of the true hornets) rather than subterranean nests. Another example is the Australian hornet (&quot;Abispa ephippium&quot;), which is actually a species of potter wasp.

==Distribution==
Hornets are found mainly in the Northern Hemisphere. The European hornet (&quot;V. crabro&quot;) is the best-known species, widely distributed in Europe (but is never found north of the 63rd parallel), and European Russia (except in extreme northern areas). In the east, the species&#x27; distribution area stretches over the Ural Mountains to western Siberia (found in the vicinity of Khanty-Mansiysk). In Asia, the European hornet is found in southern Siberia, as well as in eastern China. The European hornet was accidentally introduced to eastern North America about the middle of the 19th century and has lived there since at about the same latitudes as in Europe. However, it has never been found in western North America.

The Asian giant hornet (&quot;V. mandarinia&quot;) lives in the Primorsky Krai, Khabarovsky Krai (southern part), and Jewish Autonomous Oblast regions of Russia, and China, Korea, Taiwan, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Indochina, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Thailand, but is most commonly found in the mountains of Japan, where they are commonly known as the giant sparrow bee.

The Oriental hornet (&quot;V. orientalis&quot;) occurs in semidry, subtropical areas of central Asia (Azerbaijan, Armenia, Dagestan in Russia, Iran, Afghanistan, Oman, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrghyzstan, southern Kazakhstan), and southern Europe (Italy, Malta, Albania, Romania, Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria, Cyprus).

The Asian hornet (&quot;V. velutina&quot;) has been introduced to France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, and the United Kingdom.

==Stings==

Hornets have stingers used to kill prey and defend nests. Hornet stings are more painful to humans than typical wasp stings because hornet venom contains a large amount (5%) of acetylcholine. Individual hornets can sting repeatedly. Unlike honey bees, hornets do not die after stinging because their stingers are very finely barbed (only visible under high magnification) and can easily be withdrawn, so are not pulled out of their bodies when disengaging.

The toxicity of hornet stings varies according to hornet species; some deliver just a typical insect sting, while others are among the most venomous known insects. Single hornet stings are not in themselves fatal, except sometimes to allergic victims. Multiple stings by hornets (other than &quot;V. crabro&quot;) may be fatal because of highly toxic species-specific components of their venom.

The stings of the Asian giant hornet (&quot;V. mandarinia&quot;) are among the most venomous known, and are thought to cause 30–50 human deaths annually in Japan. Between July and September 2013, hornet stings caused the death of 42 people in China. Asian giant hornet&#x27;s venom can cause allergic reactions and multiple organ failure leading to death, though dialysis can be used to remove the toxins from the bloodstream. As with other wasps, death due to a single sting on the skin only occurs when an allergy is present, and serious outcomes with Asian giant hornet stings in China and Japan are only documented with many stings or anaphylactic shock due to an existing allergy.

People who are allergic to wasp venom may also be allergic to hornet stings. Allergic reactions are commonly treated with epinephrine (adrenaline) injection using a device such as an epinephrine autoinjector, with prompt follow-up treatment in a hospital. In severe cases, allergic individuals may go into anaphylactic shock and die unless treated promptly. In general, &quot;Vespa&quot; stings induce the release of histamine due to the various mastoparans that they contain. However &quot;V. orientalis&quot; mastoparan is the interesting exception because it does not induce histamine increase in victim tissue – because it does not cause mast cell degranulation – and is not immunogenic.

==Attack pheromone==
Hornets, like many social wasps, can mobilize the entire nest to sting in defense, which is highly dangerous to humans and other animals. The attack pheromone is released in case of threat to the nest. In the case of the Asian giant hornet (&quot;V. mandarinia&quot;), this is also used to mobilize many workers at once when attacking colonies of their prey, honey bees and other &quot;Vespa&quot; species. Three biologically active chemicals, 2-Pentanol, Isoamyl alcohol, and 1-methylbutyl 3-methylbutanoate, have been identified for this species. In field tests, 2-Pentanol alone triggered mild alarm and defensive behavior, but adding the other two compounds increased aggressiveness in a synergistic effect. In the European hornet (&quot;V. crabro&quot;) the major compound of the alarm pheromone is 2-methyl-3-butene-2-ol.

If a hornet is killed near a nest, it may release pheromones that can cause the other hornets to attack. Materials that come into contact with these pheromones, such as clothes, skin, and dead prey or hornets, can also trigger an attack, as can certain food flavorings, such as banana and apple flavorings, and fragrances that contain C5 alcohols and C esters.

==Life cycle==
In &quot;V. crabro&quot;, the nest is founded in spring by a fertilized female known as the queen. She generally selects sheltered places such as dark, hollow tree trunks. She first builds a series of cells (up to 50) out of chewed tree bark. The cells are arranged in horizontal layers named combs, each cell being vertical and closed at the top. An egg is then laid in each cell. After 5–8 days, the egg hatches. Over the following two weeks, the larva progresses through five stages of development. During this time, the queen feeds it a protein-rich diet of insects. Then, the larva spins a silk cap over the cell&#x27;s opening, and during the next two weeks, transforms into an adult, a process called metamorphosis. The adult then eats its way through the silk cap. This first generation of workers, invariably females, now gradually undertakes all the tasks formerly carried out by the queen (foraging, nest building, taking care of the brood, etc.) with the exception of egg-laying, which remains exclusive to the queen.

As the colony size grows, new combs are added, and an envelope is built around the cell layers until the nest is entirely covered, with the exception of an entry hole. To build cells in total darkness, they apparently use gravity to aid them. At the peak of its population, which occurs in late summer, the colony can reach a size of 700 workers.

At this time, the queen starts producing the first reproductive individuals. Fertilized eggs develop into females (called &quot;gynes&quot; by entomologists), and unfertilized ones develop into males (sometimes called &quot;drones&quot; as with honeybee drones). Adult males do not participate in nest maintenance, foraging, or caretaking of the larvae. In early to mid-autumn, they leave the nest and mate during &quot;nuptial flights&quot;.

Other temperate species (e.g., the yellow hornet, &quot;V. simillima&quot;, or the Oriental hornet, &quot;V. orientalis&quot;) have similar cycles. In the case of tropical species (e.g., &quot;V. tropica&quot;), life histories may well differ, and in species with both tropical and temperate distributions (such as the Asian giant hornet, &quot;V. mandarinia&quot;), the cycle likely depends on latitude.

==Diet and feeding==
Adult hornets and their relatives (e.g., yellowjackets) feed themselves with nectar and sugar-rich plant foods. Thus, they can often be found feeding on the sap of oak trees, rotting sweet fruits, honey, and any sugar-containing foodstuffs. Hornets frequently fly into orchards to feed on overripe fruit, and tend to gnaw a hole in fruit to become totally immersed in its pulp. A person who accidentally picks fruit with a feeding hornet can be attacked by the disturbed insect.

The adults also attack various insects, which they kill with stings and jaws. Due to their size and the power of their venom, hornets can kill large insects such as honey bees, grasshoppers, locusts, and katydids without difficulty. The victim is fully masticated and then fed to the larvae developing in the nest, rather than consumed by the adult hornets. Some of their prey being considered pests, hornets may be considered beneficial under some circumstances.

The larvae of hornets produce a sweet secretion containing sugars and amino acids that workers and queens consume.

== Predatory strategies ==
Hornets&#x27; ability to prey upon honey bees is favored by a number of adaptations. &quot;Vespa&quot; have a larger body size compared to their prey, a heavy exoskeleton to resist bee attacks, and strong mandibles and venomous sting. As concerns hornet hunting strategies, it has been demonstrated that some species such as &quot;V. tropica&quot; and &quot;V. velutina,&quot; can use both visual and olfactory cues for the long-range detection of honey bee colonies. Foragers of &quot;V. tropica&quot; can readily associate color and shape with potential food sources and exhibit color generalization. &quot;V. velutina&quot; foragers visually distinguish between bee dummy bait and cotton ball dummy bait, both treated with bee odors, preferring bee dummies. Foraging hornets are also selectively attracted to honey bee colony odors, in particular honey and pollen, as well as honey bee pheromones, which may signal a high prey density. In laboratory assays, workers of &quot;V. velutina&quot; oriented especially towards geraniol, a component of the honey bee worker aggregation pheromone, that could therefore represent an honest signal for hornets. Behavioral, chemical and electrophysiological analyses have also demonstrated that &quot;Vespa bicolor&quot; is attracted to (Z)-11-eicosen-1-ol, which is major compound in the alarm pheromones of both Asian (&quot;Apis cerana&quot;) and European (&quot;Apis mellifera&quot;) honey bees, and its antennae respond to this compound. Intriguingly, this hornet attraction to honey bee pheromone is also exploited by the orchid &quot;Dendrobium christyanum&quot;, which mimics the honey bee alarm pheromone in its flowers&#x27; scent to attract hornets that visit and pollinate the flowers. Bee-hunting hornets therefore likely visit the non-rewarding flowers in search of prey.

==Species ==
While a history of recognizing subspecies exists within many of the &quot;Vespa&quot; species, the most recent taxonomic revision of the genus treats all subspecific names in the genus &quot;Vespa&quot; as synonyms, effectively relegating them to no more than informal names for regional color forms.

<text>USS &quot;Skate&quot; (SSN-578) was the third submarine of the United States Navy named for the skate, a type of ray, was the lead ship of the of nuclear submarines. She was the third nuclear submarine commissioned, the first to make a completely submerged trans-Atlantic crossing, the second submarine to reach the North Pole, and the first to surface there.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;Skate&quot; was awarded to the Electric Boat division of General Dynamics on 18 July 1955, and her keel was laid in Groton, Connecticut, on 21 July 1955. She was launched on 16 May 1957, sponsored by Alice Hanauer Strauss, wife of Lewis L. Strauss, and commissioned on 23 December 1957 with Commander James F. Calvert in command.

==Operational history==
&quot;Skate&quot; conducted shakedown training out of New London, Connecticut until 29 January 1958, when she cruised to the Bermuda operating area, then returned to her home port on 8 February. Sixteen days later, the nuclear powered submarine set a course for the Isle of Portland, England. Before returning home, she had also visited ports in France and the Netherlands.

=== First visit to North Pole ===
On 30 July, &quot;Skate&quot; sought the Arctic where she operated under the ice for 10 days. During this time, she surfaced nine times through the ice, navigated over under it, and on 11 August, 9:47 pm EDT
 (the week after ) became the second sea ship to reach the North Pole. &quot;Skate&quot; was unable to surface precisely at the Pole on the August voyage due to dangerous ice conditions as noted in the captain&#x27;s 1960 book, &quot;Surface at the Pole: The Extraordinary Voyages of the USS&quot; Skate, where Calvert said, &quot;Seldom had the ice seemed so heavy and so thick as it did in the immediate vicinity of the pole. For days we had searched in vain for a suitable opening to surface in.&quot; The closest was to make radio contact at the surface from a polynya around 30 nm away, but not to surface fully owing to the risk of damage from ice. &quot;Skate&quot; did manage to surface and make contact with Drifting Ice Station Alpha at 85ºN, 300 nm away.

After being denied access to visit Copenhagen in Denmark, she sailed into Bergen, Norway on 23 August. There she was inspected by king Olav V of Norway, US ambassador Frances E. Willis and minister of defence Nils Handal. The submarine made port calls in the Netherlands, Belgium, and France before returning to New London on 25 September 1958. In recognition of the dangerous and historic feat, the &quot;Skate&quot; and its crew were given the Navy Unit Commendation award for &quot;... braving the hazards of the polar ice pack...&quot;

=== Second visit to North Pole ===
While the &quot;Skate&quot; was unable to surface on its first voyage to the pole, on 17 March 1959, she became the first submarine to surface at the North Pole. Calvert described the historic moment in his book, saying, &quot;Slowly we blew the tanks and the &quot;Skate&quot; moved reluctantly upward. It was apparent we were under heavier ice here than any we had experienced before.&quot; While at the pole, Calvert and the crew planted an American flag in a cairn they built out of ice blocks, and put a waterproof container in the cairn with a note commemorating the event. The crew also held a ceremony for the late Arctic explorer Sir Hubert Wilkins and committed his ashes at the pole. In 1931, Sir Hubert had conducted an Arctic expedition in the disarmed research submarine &quot;Nautilus&quot; (ex-). After reaching the Pole, the &quot;Skate&quot; continued its mission to pioneer arctic operations during periods of extreme cold and maximum ice thickness. When the submarine returned to port, she was awarded a bronze star in lieu of a second Navy Unit Commendation for demonstrating &quot;for the first time the ability of submarines to operate in and under the Arctic ice in the dead of winter&quot;. In the fall of 1959 and in 1960, &quot;Skate&quot; participated in exercises designed to strengthen American antisubmarine defenses.
&quot;Skate&quot; returned to General Dynamics in January 1961 for a regular overhaul and to have her reactor refueled for the first time. She put to sea in August and, for the next 11 months, conducted exercises to increase the operational readiness of her crew.

=== Third visit to North Pole ===
On 7 July 1962, &quot;Skate&quot; again set course towards the North Pole. Five days later, , did likewise from Pearl Harbor. The two submarines made their rendezvous on 31 July. After meeting, they operated together for over a week. Both submarines surfaced at the North Pole on 2 August and official greetings and insignia of Submarine Force Atlantic Fleet and Submarine Force Pacific Fleet were exchanged.

=== Later years ===
&quot;Skate&quot; returned to New London and performed fleet and local operations for the next several years. She entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard on 28 April 1965, the first nuclear submarine overhauled there, for nuclear refueling and installation of the SUBSAFE package. &quot;Skate&quot; was the first submarine to finish this major conversion program, which was instituted after the loss of in 1963. The process was not completed until September 1967.

After sea trials and a shakedown cruise in the Caribbean, the submarine returned to New London and participated in exercises involved in the development of new undersea tactics and equipment.

In October 1968, &quot;Skate&quot; was deployed to the Mediterranean where she operated with the Sixth Fleet for two months. The polar veteran operated under the Arctic ice again in March and April 1969, in October 1970, and in February 1971 . The remainder of her at sea time was spent in various Atlantic Fleet and NATO exercises. In July 1971, she began her third regular overhaul at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard and did not return to New London until 17 November 1973. In August 1974, &quot;Skate&quot; operated as a unit of the Atlantic Fleet.

In late 1977, &quot;Skate&quot; transferred to Pearl Harbor, where she joined the other three &quot;Skate&quot;-class submarines as a member of Submarine Squadron 7.

=== Decommissioning ===
&quot;Skate&quot; was decommissioned on 12 September 1986, stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 30 October 1986, and disposed of by submarine recycling at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard on 6 March 1995.

==Awards==
* Navy Unit Commendation with one star (2 awards)
* Meritorious Unit Commendation with two stars (3 awards)

&quot;Skate&quot;′s first Navy Unit Commendation was for the period 9 through 12 August 1958 and the second for the period 4 March through 6 April 1959. Her Meritorious Unit Commendations were for the periods 24 March through 15 April 1969, 12 October through 18 November 1970, and 26 February through 9 March 1971.

<text>USS &quot;Skate&quot; (SS-305) was a in service with the United States Navy from 1943 to 1946. She was used as a target ship in the 1946 atomic bomb tests and finally sunk as a target ship in October 1948.

==History==
&quot;Skate&quot; was laid down at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard of Vallejo, California, 1 August 1942. She was launched on 4 March 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Ethel L. Shamer, wife of Captain George P. Shamer, Supply Officer of the Mare Island Naval Shipyard and commissioned on 15 April.

===First War Patrol===

Following shakedown off the California coast, &quot;Skate&quot; sailed to Pearl Harbor and on 25 September 1943, headed toward Wake Island and her first war patrol during which she performed lifeguard duty for the aircraft carriers during airstrikes against that Japanese-held island. At dawn on 6 October, the submarine was strafed by enemy aircraft, mortally wounding one of her officers as he attempted to assist wounded airmen from a life raft. The next day, &quot;Skate&quot; closed to within of the beach, in the face of heavy enemy bombardment, to rescue two downed aviators. While searching for a third, she was attacked by a Japanese dive bomber, and was forced to dive to escape. After a short return to Midway Island, &quot;Skate&quot; returned to Wake Island and rescued four additional airmen before terminating her first patrol at Midway on 29 October.

===Second War Patrol===

On 15 November, &quot;Skate&quot; departed Midway for her second war patrol, conducted off Truk in the Caroline Islands. On 25 November, she sighted the masts of five warships; but, after firing a spread of torpedoes at overlapping aircraft carriers, she was forced down by depth charging from the escort ships.

On 30 November 1943, &quot;Skate&quot; attacked Japanese carriers , , and without success.

While north of Truk on 21 December 1943, the submarine torpedoed and sank the cargo ship .

==== Torpedoing of the Yamato ====
On December 25th, Skate was scouting for Japanese ships when she spotted a massive target, the Japanese &quot;super battleship&quot; Yamato ferrying troops to Truk. &quot;Yamato&quot; was the largest and most powerful battleship ever built, displacing 72,808 tons and armed with nine 18.1-inch (46 cm) main guns, the largest guns ever mounted on a warship. Seizing the opportunity, &quot;Skate&quot; fired four torpedoes, and though &quot;Yamato&quot; dodged most of them, one made its mark near her turret one.

This uncovered a design flaw present in the battleship. The ship&#x27;s torpedo defense system was very minimal, meaning torpedoes would mostly impact on the 16.1-inch (41 cm) thick armored belt. Given the belt was too thick to be welded, it was riveted instead, and torpedo hits would pop open numerous rivets and disconnect sections of the belt and lead to far more flooding than most Japanese sailors expected. 
Still, given the nature of the &quot;Yamato&quot;, damage wasn&#x27;t very significant. Only about 3,000 tons of water flooded the ship, which while perhaps worrying for a 35,000 ton treaty battleship, was only around 4% of Yamato&#x27;s displacement. Despite the damage, Yamato remained an active warship until the 10th of January, and repairs lasted only 18 days.

===Third and Fourth War Patrols===

&quot;Skate&quot;″s third war patrol was again conducted in the area of the Carolines, in support of Operation Hailstone, the carrier airstrikes on Truk. &quot;Skate&quot; departed Midway on 5 February 1944. On 16 February, the evening before the airstrike, &quot;Skate&quot; intercepted a Japanese light cruiser, which had survived a previous torpedo attack by submarine . &quot;Skate&quot; launched four torpedoes, two of which hit, engulfing the ship in a shroud of smoke as the submarine submerged to evade heavy depth charging from the enemy escorts. She later returned to the scene of the attack, but, before another torpedo could be launched, the cruiser rolled to port and sank. It was later determined the cruiser sunk was the Japanese light cruiser . Following the airstrikes and further patrol in the area, the submarine returned to Pearl Harbor on 17 March.

During her fourth war patrol, off the Bonin Islands from 11 April to 31 May, &quot;Skate&quot; scored hits on an enemy cargo ship for unconfirmed damage and, on 14 May 1944, sank an enemy sampan in a surface attack, taking three prisoners of war.

===Fifth, Sixth and Seventh War Patrols===

&quot;Skate&quot; departed Midway on 23 June 1944 on her fifth war patrol, conducted off the Kuril Islands. On 7 July, she intercepted a convoy of five ships and escorting destroyers, fired three torpedoes, and sank the trailing destroyer, . The submarine was then forced deep by the other escorts and depth charged for over two hours before escaping. On 15 July, the submarine sank a cargo ship taking two prisoners and, on the following day, another cargo ship was also sent to the bottom. &quot;Skate&quot; terminated her fifth patrol at Pearl Harbor on 7 August.

Departing Pearl Harbor on 9 September, &quot;Skate&quot; sailed for the Ryukyu Islands and her sixth war patrol, during which she performed photographic reconnaissance of Okinawa and, on 29 September 1944, sank a small patrol craft and a cargo ship. Following her return to Pearl Harbor, she got underway for a complete overhaul at Hunters Point Navy Yard, San Francisco, California.

&quot;Skate&quot; got underway from Pearl Harbor for her seventh war patrol on 11 April 1945, to form a coordinated attack group with other submarines and patrol in the Sea of Japan. On the morning of 10 June, she encountered , a Japanese submarine on the surface returning to port. As the enemy crossed her bow, &quot;Skate&quot; launched two torpedoes with two hits, sinking the target. Two days later, while off the Nanto Peninsula, she evaded gunfire of enemy ships and an attack by an enemy escort to sink three cargo ships. &quot;Skate&quot; terminated her seventh war patrol at Pearl Harbor on 4 July 1945.
===End of World War II and fate===

&quot;Skate&quot; departed Pearl Harbor on 5 August 1945 for her eighth war patrol; but, while en route to the patrol area, she received word of the Japanese surrender and returned to port, and then set sail for the United States arriving at San Diego, on 6 September. For the next four months, she participated in training operations along the west coast, and then sailed to Pearl Harbor arriving on 9 January 1946. On 21 May, she departed for Bikini Atoll, Marshall Islands, to be used as a target ship in Operation Crossroads, the atomic bomb tests.

&quot;Skate&quot; was moored directly astern of the battleship , the target ship for test &quot;Able&quot;. &quot;Skate&quot;″s crew was transferred to a transport where they maintained &quot;Skate&quot;″s log with entries reading &quot;Moored as before, no one on board.&quot; The bomber missed &quot;Nevada&quot; and the bomb detonated above and astern of &quot;Skate&quot;, mangling the submarine&#x27;s conning tower and raising the main ballast tank vents but leaving the pressure hull intact. The crew returned to the submarine and, finding the interior offered preferable living conditions to the transport, was able to get the surfaced submarine underway at .

The crew was again transferred to the transport after &quot;Skate&quot; moored on the fringe of the formation for test &quot;Baker&quot;, which caused no further physical damage, but coated the submarine exterior with radioactive isotopes. When the crew was unable to remove the radioactivity, they were transferred to the submarine tender . &quot;Skate&quot; was towed back to Pearl Harbor, where she was moored in an isolated berth. On 11 October, salvage vessel took &quot;Skate&quot; in tow and headed for San Francisco, and then to Mare Island Naval Shipyard where the submarine was inspected and then decommissioned on 11 December. &quot;Skate&quot; was expended as a torpedo target off the California coast on 5 October 1948, and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 21 October 1948.

== Awards ==
&quot;Skate&quot; received eight battle stars for World War II service.

<doc id="227542" wikidata="Q7037230" url="?curid=227542" title="Vespidae">
<text>The Vespidae are a large (nearly 5000 species), diverse, cosmopolitan family of wasps, including nearly all the known eusocial wasps (such as &quot;Polistes fuscatus&quot;, &quot;Vespa orientalis&quot;, and &quot;Vespula germanica&quot;) and many solitary wasps. Each social wasp colony includes a queen and a number of female workers with varying degrees of sterility relative to the queen. In temperate social species, colonies usually last only one year, dying at the onset of winter. New queens and males (drones) are produced towards the end of the summer, and after mating, the queens hibernate over winter in cracks or other sheltered locations. The nests of most species are constructed out of mud, but polistines and vespines use plant fibers, chewed to form a sort of paper (also true of some stenogastrines). Many species are pollen vectors contributing to the pollination of several plants, being potential or even effective pollinators, while others are notable predators of pest insect species, and a few species are invasive pests.

The subfamilies Polistinae and Vespinae are composed solely of eusocial species, while the Eumeninae, Euparagiinae, Gayellinae, Masarinae and Zethinae are all with the exception of a few communal and several subsocial species. The Stenogastrinae are facultatively eusocial, considering nests may have one or several adult females; in cases where the nest is shared by multiple females (typically, a mother and her daughters) there is reproductive division of labor and cooperative brood care.

In the Polistinae and Vespinae, rather than consuming prey directly, prey are premasticated and fed to the larvae, which in return, produce a clear liquid (with high amino acid content) for the adults to consume; the exact amino acid composition varies considerably among species, but it is considered to contribute substantially to adult nutrition.

Fossils are known since Aptian of the Early Cretaceous, with several described species from Cretaceous amber.

<doc id="227547" wikidata="Q7597223" url="?curid=227547" title="Stale seed bed">
<text>The stale seed bed or false seed bed method is a weed control technique used at both the farm and garden scales. In this that the young weeds can then be easily eliminated. By destroying them early, the farmer or gardener eliminates most of that season&#x27;s annual weeds, which reduces their labor and improves their crop yields.

== Description ==
The stale seed bed technique of weed control was developed before herbicide use began. It reduces the soil&#x27;s seed bank or quantity by allowing the weed seeds both opportunity and time to germinate, sprout, and appear before the intended crop is planted. Once the weeds appear, they are easily eliminated by various methods that minimize further soil disturbance. This cycle can be repeated numerous times before planting the crop. Early reduction of the weed seed quantity by this method reduces the need to weed for the rest of the growing season, and in some cases performs as well as chemical weed control methods.

== Method ==
The false or stale seed bed technique can be started immediately after harvesting a field, or at least two weeks prior to planting a new crop.

===Farm-scale Approach===
The farm field should be worked and smoothed into a flat fine seed bed. The initial tillage is normally done with a disc harrow or a rotary tiller, rather than with a plow. If plowing is required, secondary passes with a disc or tiller will be needed. The next step is to break up clods and flatten the surface is done with a spring-tooth or spike-tooth harrow, or with a chain drag harrow, depending on the soil type. Final preparation is done with a cultipacker or other type of roller to firm the soil, which enhances seed germination.

After the weeds have sprouted and reached the first-leaf stage, they are eliminated. This is done with by either mechanical or thermal means. 

*Mechanical elimination of these small weed seedlings is done by stirring the surface of the soil to uproot and bury the seedlings. The most commonly used implement is a field cultivator fitted with sweeps. Either duckfoot sweeps and blade sweeps (beet knife) can be used, but must be set for a very shallow depth of cut. The other implement that can be used is a chain harrow or drag harrow. 
*Thermal elimination of the small weed seedlings is done with a flame weeder. This method has the added advantage of not disturbing the soil at all. Flame weeding uses propane to very briefly expose the seedlings to flame and intense heat. It does not burn the plant, but instead causes denaturing of the cell membranes and subsequent dehydration. A flame weeder implement is normally a trailer that is light enough to be pulled through the field by either a tractor or a pickup truck.

In many cases, several cycles of cultivatortilling and weeding are done, often at 2 week intervals. This allows more and
more weed seeds to germinate and be removed. Repetition eliminates more weeds, but care
must be used to not delay planting of a desirable crop later than the crop needs for a successful
season&#x27;s growth. After several years, most, if not all, weeds can be eliminated from the seed
bank in the soil.

===Garden-scale Approach===
The stale seed bed method can easily be used in the garden. The timing and steps are the same
as described for a farm-scale operation, but the equipment used is different. Rather than repeat
the description of the steps detailed above, the equipment changes will be noted here.

Initial tillage in the garden can be done by spading with a shovel or spade, cultivating with a
wheel cultivator, or by tilling with grub hoe or a rototiller. The soil should only be worked deep
enough to kill existing plants and loosen enough soil to create a seed bed. The garden tillage
depth is normally about 4 inches, with a maximum of 6 inches.

Seed bed finishing can be done with a heavy garden rake to break up clods and level the soil. Lightly rolling, tamping, or compacting the soil surface will increase germination. The garden can also be watered to speed up germination of the weeds.

After the weeds have sprouted and reached the first-leaf stage, they are eliminated using mechanical or thermal methods as above.

Mechanical elimination of small weed seedlings in the garden is done by stirring the surface of the soil to uproot and bury the seedlings. This can be done with a long-handled hoe that only works at the surface of the soil, such as a light draw hoe, a stirrup hoe, or a scuffle hoe. Weeding can also be done with a wheel hoe outfitted with sweeps.

Thermal destruction of the small weed seedlings can be done with a flame weeder, which does
not disturb the soil at all. There are both hand-held units for small gardens, and wheeled
versions for larger gardens.

===No-Till Approach===

A no-till approach to creating a stale seed bed is usually done on large commercial garden beds or in home gardens. It skips the soil tillage steps, but may involve removing enough plant residue to avoid problems with the tarps. The no-till stale seed bed method involves covering the soil with plastic or silage tarps.

There are two basic strategies: soil solarization and soil occultation. With soil solarization, the seed bed is covered with a clear plastic sheet which heats the soil to a temperature that kills pests, pathogens, and weeds. With occultation, black plastic or silage tarps are laid over the soil, creating a moist and warm environment in which weed seeds germinate, and then die due to lack of light. In either case, the seedbed is prepared and moistened prior to covering with the plastic or tarp.

<text>FTL Games (Faster Than Light) was the video game development division of Software Heaven Inc. FTL created several popular video games in the 1980s. Despite the company&#x27;s small size, FTL products were consistently number-one sellers and received the highest critical acclaim and industry awards. 

FTL was founded by Wayne Holder in 1982. Holder started Software Heaven and FTL as its game division after founding Oasis Systems, which specialized in spell checking software. He hired Bruce Webster, with whom he graduated from high school, to head FTL. After Webster left FTL in 1984, Doug Bell joined FTL and served as the Technical Director until FTL ceased operations in 1996.

==The games==
FTL released several games throughout its relatively short history. Most went on to become best sellers and some even set new standards for games of their genres.

===&quot;SunDog: Frozen Legacy&quot;===

Holder and Webster co-designed FTL&#x27;s first game, &quot;&quot;, a space trading game. It was released first for the Apple II in March 1984. Webster did most of the programming for the Apple II version, but resigned from FTL after the release of version 2.0. Doug Bell, Andy Jaros and Michael Newton significantly enhanced the game&#x27;s graphics when porting the game to the Atari ST, releasing it in late 1985. &quot;SunDog&quot; became the best selling game on the Atari ST during the system&#x27;s first year, and garnered lavish critical acclaim.

The packaging cover art was designed and illustrated by David R. Darrow.

===&quot;Oids&quot;===

&quot;Oids&quot;, an action game, was one of FTL&#x27;s minor releases. The original Atari ST version was created by Dan Hewitt who did both the graphics and all of the programming. It received little attention with a later conversion to the Mac, but received 5 Stars on &quot;Macworld&quot; 1990. However the original Atari ST release received rave reviews in the UK, where it remains a cult favourite. Later, after FTL ceased operations, an updated authorized shareware version of &quot;Oids&quot; for the Macintosh was developed and released by Kirk Baker.
It was however eclipsed by the release of FTL&#x27;s next game.

As with &quot;SunDog&quot;, the packaging cover art was designed and illustrated by David R. Darrow.

===&quot;Dungeon Master&quot;===
&quot;Dungeon Master&quot; is a fantasy role-playing game, which popularized real-time gameplay. The game included a number of user interface features that made gameplay particularly enjoyable, from a spell system that seemed to be &quot;logical&quot; to the intuitive way the player used the mouse to directly manipulate items in the simulated 3D view. It was released on the ST in 1987 and went on to become the ST&#x27;s best selling product of all time. It was eventually ported to over a dozen platforms in six languages.

It received many awards, including the first &quot;Special Award for Artistic Achievement&quot; from &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; when it was initially released.

Darrow illustrated the cover artwork for this game as well.

===&quot;Chaos Strikes Back&quot;===
A &quot;Dungeon Master&quot; sequel, &quot;Chaos Strikes Back&quot;, was released in 1989 for most platforms, but notably excluding a PC version. It uses the same engine as &quot;Dungeon Master&quot; but features new creatures and graphics.

=== &quot;Dungeon Master: Theron&#x27;s Quest&quot; ===
&quot;Dungeon Master: Theron&#x27;s Quest&quot; was a simplified Dungeon Master version with new dungeons from 1992 for TurboGrafx-16 and the PC Engine.

=== &quot;Dungeon Master II&quot; ===
&quot;Dungeon Master II: The Legend of Skullkeep&quot; was the best-selling game of the week when it was released in Japan in December 1993. For some reason, it took two years before it was released in the US and Europe in 1995 by Interplay Productions. While the game had been anxiously awaited by legions of &quot;Dungeon Master&quot; players, by 1995 it was considered too dated and sold poorly. FTL broke up about this time.

=== &quot;Dungeon Master Nexus&quot; ===
&quot;Dungeon Master Nexus&quot; was released 1998 for Sega Saturn and only the Japanese market under the &quot;FTL&quot; and &quot;Software Heaven&quot; brand. It was developed and published by &quot;Victor Interactive Software&quot;.

<text>In the social sciences, methodological individualism is a method for explaining social phenomena strictly in terms of the decisions of individuals, each being moved by their own personal motivations. In contrast, explanations of social phenomena which assume that cause and effect acts upon whole classes or groups are deemed illusory, and thus rejected according to this approach. Or to put it another way, only group dynamics which can be explained in terms of individual subjective motivations are considered valid. With its bottom-up micro-level approach, methodological individualism is often contrasted with methodological holism, a top-down macro-level approach, and methodological pluralism.

== History within the Social Sciences==
This framework was introduced as a foundational assumption within the social sciences by Max Weber, and discussed in his book &quot;Economy and Society&quot;. Within later schools of economic thought, such as the Austrian School, strict adherence to methodological individualism is considered a necessary starting principle. It draws heavily upon assumptions of neoclassical economics, where social behavior is explained in terms of rational actors whose choices are constrained by prices and incomes, and where individuals&#x27; subjective preferences are treated as a given.

== Criticisms ==
Economist Mark Blaug has criticized over-reliance on methodological individualism in economics, saying that &quot;it is helpful to note what methodological individualism strictly interpreted [...] would imply for economics. In effect, it would rule out all macroeconomic propositions that cannot be reduced to microeconomic ones [...] this amounts to saying goodbye to almost the whole of received macroeconomics. There must be something wrong with a methodological principle that has such devastating implications&quot;.

Similarly, the economist Alan Kirman has critiqued general equilibrium theory and modern economics for its &quot;fundamentally individualistic approach to constructing economic models&quot;, and showed that an individualist competitive equilibrium is not necessarily stable or unique. However, stability and uniqueness can be achieved if aggregate variables are added, and as a result he argued &quot;the idea that we should start at the level of the isolated individual is one which we may well have to abandon&quot;.

<text>Edward Venables-Vernon-Harcourt (10 October 1757 – 5 November 1847) was a Church of England bishop. He was the Bishop of Carlisle from 1791 to 1807 and then the Archbishop of York until his death.

He was the third son of the George Venables-Vernon, 1st Baron Vernon (1709–1780), and Martha Harcourt, sister to the 1st Earl Harcourt. Later he assumed the additional name of Harcourt on succeeding the property including Nuneham House from his childless first cousin, the 3rd Earl Harcourt, in 1831.

==Early life==
Edward Venables-Vernon was born at Sudbury Hall, Derbyshire on 10 October 1757. He was educated at Westminster School; matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford on 2 July 1774; was elected fellow of All Souls College in 1777 and graduated B.C.L. 27 April 1786, and D.C.L., 4 May following. After his ordination he was instituted to the family living of Sudbury. He became a canon of Christ Church, Oxford, 13 October 1785, and a prebendary of Gloucester on 10 November in the same year. He resigned his prebendal stall in 1791, but held his other appointments to 1808. His sister Elizabeth married their first cousin the 2nd Earl Harcourt.

On 18 August 1791 he was nominated as the Bishop of Carlisle in succession to John Douglas and was consecrated on 6 November following. For 16 years he administered the affairs of the see of Carlisle with good sense and discretion, spending more than the whole income of the see upon the wants of his diocese.

==Archbishop of York==

After the death of Archbishop William Markham. Venables-Vernon was nominated on 26 November 1807 as archbishop of York, and was confirmed in St. James&#x27;s Church, Westminster on 19 January 1808. In the same year, on 20 January, he was gazetted a privy councillor, and made Lord High Almoner to George III, an office which he also held under Queen Victoria&#x27;s reign.

According to the account of Dean Alford:
&quot;Archbishop Harcourt was very fond of hunting, so fond that he was very near refusing the archbishopric because he thought if he accepted he should have to give it up. He consulted a friend, who said that he must take counsel with others. &#x27;Of course I should never join the meet,’ said the Archbishop, &#x27;but you know I might fall in with the hounds by accident.&#x27; After some time the friend came back and said that on the whole the party considered that the Archbishop might hunt, provided he did not shout.&quot;

Venables-Vernon was a member of the queen&#x27;s council who had charge of George III during his illness. He was an eloquent speaker, and occasionally spoke in the House of Lords on ecclesiastical matters, but usually abstained from political contentions. He lived under five successive monarchs, and was respected for benevolence and simplicity of character. On 15 January 1831 he took the surname of Harcourt only on inheriting the large estates of the Harcourt family, which came to him on the death of his first cousin, Field-marshal William, third and last Earl Harcourt.

In 1835 he was appointed one of the first members of the Ecclesiastical Commission. In 1838 he was offered the renewal of the Harcourt peerage, but declined it, not wishing to be fettered in his parliamentary votes. York Minster twice suffered fires during his primacy, 1829 and 1841, and he contributed largely to both restorations. 

Archbishop Harcourt preached his valedictory sermon in York Minster on 13 November 1838. He continued to enjoy good health, and as late as 1 November 1847 visited York and inspected the repairs of the chapterhouse. Early in October 1847, however, Harcourt fell into an ornamental pool at Bishopthorpe after a bridge on which he was walking collapsed. Though he continued his engagements, he was left partially paralysed. He died at the palace at Bishopthorpe, near York, on 5 November 1847, and was buried at Stanton Harcourt, Oxfordshire, 13 November.

A memorial to Harcourt was erected in York Minster in 1855 sculpted by Matthew Noble.

==Family==
On 5 February 1784 he married Lady Anne Leveson-Gower, third daughter of Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Marquess of Stafford and Lady Louisa Egerton, daughter of Scroop Egerton, 1st Duke of Bridgewater. They had sixteen children. His wife predeceased him at Bishopthorpe Palace on 16 November 1832, aged 72.

His second son, the Revd. Leveson Vernon Harcourt, was chancellor of York, an author of &quot;The Doctrine of the Deluge&quot; and of other theological works. His fourth son was William Vernon Harcourt, the founder of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. Two of his sons became Admirals and his youngest daughter, Georgiana, distinguished herself as a translator.

The children included:
*George Granville Vernon-Harcourt (6 Aug 1785 – 19 Dec 1861)
*The Reverend Leveson Venables-Vernon-Harcourt (1788 – 26 Jul 1860)
*Reverend William Vernon Harcourt (Jun 1789 – 1 Apr 1871) inherited Nuneham House.
*Admiral Frederick Edward Vernon-Harcourt (15 Jun 1790 – 1 May 1883), forefather to the 11th Lord Vernon
*Lt.-Col. Henry Venables-Vernon-Harcourt (1791 – 26 Feb 1853)
*Granville Harcourt-Vernon (26 Jul 1792 – 8 Dec 1879)
*Vice-Admiral Octavius Henry Cyril Harcourt (26 Dec 1793 – 14 Aug 1863)
*The Reverend Charles Vernon-Harcourt (14 Nov 1798 – 10 Dec 1870)
*Colonel Francis Venables-Vernon-Harcourt (6 Jan 1801 – 23 Apr 1880)
*Egerton Vernon-Harcourt (1803 – 19 Oct 1883 Whitwell Hall, Yorkshire), who was a president of the United Debating Society in 1824 while educated at Christ Church, Oxford.
*Louisa Augusta Venables-Vernon-Harcourt (c. 1804 – 4 Aug 1869), who married Sir John Vanden-Bempde-Johnstone, Baronet, of Hackness, on 14 June 1825 at St. George&#x27;s, Hanover Square. He died 24 Feb 1869, the widow dying only a few months later on 4 Aug 1869, at Eridge Castle, Kent.
*Georgiana Charlotte Frances Harcourt (1807–1886)

==Cato Street conspiracy==
As a director of the Ancient Concerts, Harcourt entertained his fellow-directors (the prince regent and Prince Adolphus – the Duke of Cambridge, the Duke of Cumberland (later the King of Hanover), and the Duke of Wellington) at his house in Grosvenor Square on 23 February 1821. On the same night the Cato Street conspirators had designed the murder of the cabinet ministers at the house adjoining Harcourt&#x27;s, where the ministers had agreed to dine with Lord Harrowby.

==Harcourt&#x27;s publications==
# &quot;A Sermon preached before the Lords on the Anniversary of the Martyrdom of King Charles the First,&quot; 1794.
# &quot;A Sermon preached before the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel,&quot; 1798.
# &quot;A Sermon preached at the Coronation of George IV,&quot; 1821, which was twice reprinted.

An account of the life of Margaret Godolphin who died in 1678 was written by John Evelyn and this was passed down through his family to Harcourt. Harcourt allowed it to be published in 1847 with the assistance of the Bishop of Oxford.

<doc id="227572" wikidata="Q836133" url="?curid=227572" title="Economic equilibrium">
<text>In economics, economic equilibrium is a situation in which the economic forces of supply and demand are balanced, meaning that economic variables will no longer change.

Market equilibrium in this case is a condition where a market price is established through competition such that the amount of goods or services sought by buyers is equal to the amount of goods or services produced by sellers. This price is often called the competitive price or market clearing price and will tend not to change unless demand or supply changes, and quantity is called the &quot;competitive quantity&quot; or market clearing quantity.

==Understanding economic equilibrium==
An economic equilibrium is a situation when the economic agent cannot change the situation by adopting any strategy. The concept has been borrowed from the physical sciences. Take a system where physical forces are balanced for instance.This economically interpreted means no further change ensues.

==Properties of equilibrium==
Three basic properties of equilibrium in general have been proposed by Huw Dixon. These are:

* Equilibrium property P1: The behavior of agents is consistent.

* Equilibrium property P2: No agent has an incentive to change its behavior.

* Equilibrium property P3: Equilibrium is the outcome of some dynamic process (stability).

===Example: competitive equilibrium===
In a competitive equilibrium, supply equals demand. Property P1 is satisfied, because at the equilibrium price the amount supplied is equal to the amount demanded. Property P2 is also satisfied. Demand is chosen to maximize utility given the market price: no one on the demand side has any incentive to demand more or less at the prevailing price. Likewise supply is determined by firms maximizing their profits at the market price: no firm will want to supply any more or less at the equilibrium price. Hence, agents on neither the demand side nor the supply side will have any incentive to alter their actions.

To see whether Property P3 is satisfied, consider what happens when the price is above the equilibrium. In this case there is an excess supply, with the quantity supplied exceeding that demanded. This will tend to put downward pressure on the price to make it return to equilibrium. Likewise where the price is below the equilibrium point (also known as the &quot;sweet spot&quot;) there is a shortage in supply leading to an increase in prices back to equilibrium. Not all equilibria are &quot;stable&quot; in the sense of equilibrium property P3. It is possible to have competitive equilibria that are unstable. However, if an equilibrium is unstable, it raises the question of reaching it. Even if it satisfies properties P1 and P2, the absence of P3 means that the market can only be in the unstable equilibrium if it starts off there.

In most simple microeconomic stories of supply and demand a static equilibrium is observed in a market; however, economic equilibrium can be also dynamic. Equilibrium may also be economy-wide or general, as opposed to the partial equilibrium of a single market. Equilibrium can change if there is a change in demand or supply conditions. For example, an increase in supply will disrupt the equilibrium, leading to lower prices. Eventually, a new equilibrium will be attained in most markets. Then, there will be no change in price or the amount of output bought and sold — until there is an exogenous shift in supply or demand (such as changes in technology or tastes). That is, there are no endogenous forces leading to the price or the quantity.

===Example: monopolist equilibrium===

In a monopoly, marginal revenue (MR) equals marginal cost (MC). The equilibrium quantity is obtained from where MR and MC intersect and the equilibrium price can be found on the demand curve where MR = MC. Property P1 is not satisfied because the amount demand and the amount supplied at the equilibrium price are not equal. Property P2 is not satisfied. Because the monopolist&#x27;s profit-maximizing quantity is different from the socially-maximizing quantity, consumers have an incentive to demand more at the equilibrium price. However, at the market price, monopolists maximize their profits so they have no incentive to change their price. Therefore, agents on the demand side have an incentive to alter their actions while the agents on the supply side do not have any incentive to alter their actions. 

In order to determine if Property P3 is satisfied, the same situations used to determine P3 in a competitive equilibrium can be used. When there is an excess in supply, monopolists will realize that the equilibrium is not at the profit-maximizing quantity and will put upward pressure on the price to make it return to equilibrium. This is the same case when the price is above the equilibrium and the shortage in supply leads the monopolist to decrease the supply to return to the profit-maximizing quantity. Therefore the equilibrium is the result of stability.

===Example: Nash equilibrium===

The Nash equilibrium is widely used in economics as the main alternative to competitive equilibrium. It is used whenever there is a strategic element to the behavior of agents and the &quot;price taking&quot; assumption of competitive equilibrium is inappropriate. The first use of the Nash equilibrium was in the Cournot duopoly as developed by Antoine Augustin Cournot in his 1838 book. Both firms produce a homogenous product: given the total amount supplied by the two firms, the (single) industry price is determined using the demand curve. This determines the revenues of each firm (the industry price times the quantity supplied by the firm). The profit of each firm is then this revenue minus the cost of producing the output. Clearly, there is a &quot;strategic interdependence&quot; between the two firms. If one firm varies its output, this will in turn affect the market price and so the revenue and profits of the other firm. We can define the payoff function which gives the profit of each firm as a function of the two outputs chosen by the firms. Cournot assumed that each firm chooses its own output to maximize its profits given the output of the other firm. The Nash equilibrium occurs when both firms are producing the outputs which maximize their own profit given the output of the other firm.

In terms of the equilibrium properties, we can see that P2 is satisfied: in a Nash equilibrium, neither firm has an incentive to deviate from the Nash equilibrium given the output of the other firm. P1 is satisfied since the payoff function ensures that the market price is consistent with the outputs supplied and that each firms profits equal revenue minus cost at this output.

Is the equilibrium stable as required by P3? Cournot himself argued that it was stable using the stability concept implied by best response dynamics. The reaction function for each firm gives the output which maximizes profits (best response) in terms of output for a firm in terms of a given output of the other firm. In the standard Cournot model this is downward sloping: if the other firm produces a higher output, the best response involves producing less. Best response dynamics involves firms starting from some arbitrary position and then adjusting output to their best-response to the previous output of the other firm. So long as the reaction functions have a slope of less than -1, this will converge to the Nash equilibrium. However, this stability story is open to much criticism. As Dixon argues: &quot;&quot;The crucial weakness is that, at each step, the firms behave myopically: they choose their output to maximize their current profits given the output of the other firm, but ignore the fact that the process specifies that the other firm will adjust its output&quot;...&quot;. There are other concepts of stability that have been put forward for the Nash equilibrium, evolutionary stability for example.

==Market clearing prices==
Most economists, for example Paul Samuelson, caution against attaching a normative meaning (value judgement) to the equilibrium price. For example, food markets may be in equilibrium at the same time that people are starving (because they cannot afford to pay the high equilibrium price).

Indeed, this occurred during the Great Famine in Ireland in 1845–52, where food was exported though people were starving, due to the greater profits in selling to the English – the equilibrium price of the Irish-British market for potatoes was above the price that Irish farmers could afford, and thus (among other reasons) they starved.

==Interpretations==
In most interpretations, classical economists such as Adam Smith maintained that the free market would tend towards economic equilibrium through the price mechanism. That is, any excess supply (market surplus or glut) would lead to &quot;price cuts&quot;, which decrease the quantity supplied (by reducing the incentive to produce and sell the product) and increase the quantity demanded (by offering consumers bargains), automatically abolishing the glut. Similarly, in an unfettered market, any excess demand (or shortage) would lead to &quot;price increases&quot;, reducing the quantity demanded (as customers are priced out of the market) and increasing in the quantity supplied (as the incentive to produce and sell a product rises). As before, the disequilibrium (here, the shortage) disappears. This automatic abolition of
non-market-clearing situations distinguishes markets from central planning schemes, which often have a difficult time getting prices right and suffer from persistent shortages of goods and services.

This view came under attack from at least two viewpoints. Modern mainstream economics points to cases where equilibrium does not correspond to market clearing (but instead to unemployment), as with the efficiency wage hypothesis in labor economics. In some ways parallel is the phenomenon of credit rationing, in which banks hold interest rates low to create an excess demand for loans, so they can pick and choose whom to lend to. Further, economic equilibrium can correspond with monopoly, where the monopolistic firm maintains an artificial shortage to prop up prices and to maximize profits. Finally, Keynesian macroeconomics points to underemployment equilibrium, where a surplus of labor (i.e., cyclical unemployment) co-exists for a long time with a shortage of aggregate demand.

==Solving for the competitive equilibrium price==
To find the equilibrium price, one must either plot the supply and demand curves, or solve for the expressions for supply and demand being equal.

An example may be:

:formula_1
In the diagram, depicting simple set of supply and demand curves, the quantity demanded and supplied at price P are equal.

At any price above P supply exceeds demand, while at a price below P the quantity demanded exceeds that supplied. In other words, prices where demand and supply are out of balance are termed points of disequilibrium, creating shortages and oversupply. Changes in the conditions of demand or supply will shift the demand or supply curves. This will cause changes in the equilibrium price and quantity in the market.

Consider the following demand and supply schedule:

* The equilibrium price in the market is $5.00 where demand and supply are equal at 12,000 units
* If the current market price was $3.00 – there would be excess demand for 8,000 units, creating a shortage.
* If the current market price was $8.00 – there would be excess supply of 12,000 units.

When there is a shortage in the market we see that, to correct this disequilibrium, the price of the good will be increased back to a price of $5.00, thus lessening the quantity demanded and increasing the quantity supplied thus that the market is in balance.

When there is an oversupply of a good, such as when price is above $6.00, then we see that producers will decrease the price to increase the quantity demanded for the good, thus eliminating the excess and taking the market back to equilibrium.

===Influences changing price===
A change in equilibrium price may occur through a change in either the supply or demand schedules. For instance, starting from the above supply-demand configuration, an increased level of disposable income may produce a new demand schedule, such as the following:

Here we see that an increase in disposable income would increase the quantity demanded of the good by 2,000 units at each price. This increase in demand would have the effect of shifting the demand curve rightward. The result is a change in the price at which quantity supplied equals quantity demanded. In this case we see that the two now equal each other at an increased price of $6.00. A decrease in disposable income would have the exact opposite effect on the market equilibrium.

We will also see similar behaviour in price when there is a change in the supply schedule, occurring through technological changes, or through changes in business costs. An increase in technological usage or know-how or a decrease in costs would have the effect of increasing the quantity supplied at each price, thus reducing the equilibrium price. On the other hand, a decrease in technology or increase in business costs will decrease the quantity supplied at each price, thus increasing equilibrium price.

The process of comparing two static equilibria to each other, as in the above example, is known as comparative statics. For example, since a rise in consumers&#x27; income leads to a higher price (and a decline in consumers&#x27; income leads to a fall in the price — in each case the two things change in the same direction), we say that the comparative static effect of consumer income on the price is positive. This is another way of saying that the total derivative of price with respect to consumer income is greater than zero.

==Dynamic equilibrium==

Whereas in a static equilibrium all quantities have unchanging values, in a dynamic equilibrium various quantities may all be growing at the same rate, leaving their ratios unchanging. For example, in the neoclassical growth model, the working population is growing at a rate which is exogenous (determined outside the model, by non-economic forces). In dynamic equilibrium, output and the physical capital stock also grow at that same rate, with output per worker and the capital stock per worker unchanging. Similarly, in models of inflation a dynamic equilibrium would involve the price level, the nominal money supply, nominal wage rates, and all other nominal values growing at a single common rate, while all real values are unchanging, as is the inflation rate.

The process of comparing two dynamic equilibria to each other is known as comparative dynamics. For example, in the neoclassical growth model, starting from one dynamic equilibrium based in part on one particular saving rate, a permanent increase in the saving rate leads to a new dynamic equilibrium in which there are permanently higher capital per worker and productivity per worker, but an unchanged growth rate of output; so it is said that in this model the comparative dynamic effect of the saving rate on capital per worker is positive but the comparative dynamic effect of the saving rate on the output growth rate is zero.

==Disequilibrium==
Disequilibrium characterizes a market that is not in equilibrium. Disequilibrium can occur extremely briefly or over an extended period of time. At the other extreme, many economists view labor markets as being in a state of disequilibrium—specifically one of excess supply—over extended periods of time. Goods markets are somewhere in between: prices of some goods, while sluggish in adjusting due to menu costs, long-term contracts, and other impediments, do not stay at disequilibrium levels indefinitely.

<doc id="227575" wikidata="Q7171545" url="?curid=227575" title="Pet Lamb">
<text>Pet Lamb were a Dublin-based rock band formed in 1991. They released two albums before splitting in 2000.

==History==
The band&#x27;s initial line-up was Brian Mooney (vocals, guitar), Dylan Philips (vocals, guitar), Kevin Talbot (bass guitar), and James Lillis (drums). Irish independent record label Blunt Records released two EP&#x27;s, &quot;Paranoid From The Neck Down&quot; (1993) and &quot;Spent&quot; (1994). Influenced by The Jesus Lizard and Butthole Surfers, they played support slots for Therapy?, Nomeansno, Babes In Toyland.

In February 1994 they recorded their first Peel session for BBC Radio. This brought interest from Roadrunner Records, who signed them, releasing the single &quot;Black Mask&quot; in late 1994, before combining the tracks from the Blunt EPs for the &quot;Sweaty Handshake&quot; LP. The album, released in January 1995, got a 9/12 rating from &quot;Hot Press&quot;.

They released the single &quot;Where Did Your Plans Go?&quot; in April 1995, described by &quot;Melody Maker&quot; as &quot;noisy nonsense&quot;. In July they recorded their second Peel session. In November that year they recorded their first studio album for Roadrunner with producer Martin Bisi in New York City, called &quot;High Anxiety&quot;. Although artwork for the album, and for its lead single, &quot;Holes&quot;, was drafted, neither were ultimately released as the band were dropped by the label in mid 1996.

In 1996 drummer James Lillis left the band and was replaced by multi instrumentalist David Lacey. In summer 1997 they recorded their final album &quot;Tenderness&quot;, released on Blunt Records in April 1998.

The band split up in 2000.

The lost album &quot;High Anxiety&quot; was released on Spotify in 2014.

<doc id="227584" wikidata="Q735035" url="?curid=227584" title="Wildlife garden">
<text>A wildlife garden (or habitat garden or backyard restoration) is an environment created with the purpose to serve as a sustainable haven for surrounding wildlife. Wildlife gardens contain a variety of habitats that cater to native and local plants, birds, amphibians, reptiles, insects, mammals and so on, and are meant to sustain locally native flora and fauna. Other names this type of gardening goes by can vary, prominent ones being habitat, ecology, and conservation gardening.

Both public and private gardens can be specifically transformed to attract the native wildlife, and in doing so, provide a natural array of support through available shelter and sustenance. This method of gardening can be a form of restoration in private gardens as much as those in public, as they contribute to connectivity due to the variability of their scattered locations, as well as an increased habitat availability.

Establishing a garden that emulates the environment before the residence was built and/or renders the garden similar to intact wild areas nearby (rewilding) will allow natural systems to interact and establish an equilibrium, ultimately minimizing the need for gardener maintenance and intervention. Wildlife gardens can also play an essential role in biological pest control, and also promote biodiversity, native plantings, and generally benefit the wider environment. Some environmental benefits include the reduction in pest populations through the natural mechanism of biological pest control, by helping reduce the need for pesticides. Habitat gardens also provide the environment an ecosystem service by recharging aquifers by intercepting rainfall.

== Purpose ==
Anthropogenic activities such as land development and urbanization are major drivers of habitat destruction, causing habitat loss and displacing wildlife as a result of increasing fragmentation. Fragmentation, among other human factors contributing to habitat loss, aside from constant land disturbance (such as the heavy use of pesticides), all contribute to large declines in wildlife populations and biodiversity. By converting private green spaces in residential and commercial areas to wildlife or habitat gardens, residents can collectively assist restorative and conservation efforts in providing more spaces for wildlife to survive, and potentially strengthen ecological resilience in urban areas. Rewilding lawns can turn the garden into a carbon sink.

=== Planning ===
Planning a successful wildlife garden requires consideration of the area surroundings, and a focus on overall ecological functionality. Vegetative structure and complexity play an important role in the benefits the landscape will provide to the wildlife, through the varying plants serving as sources of food and cover for survival. In particular, planting native vegetation creates greater diversity in yards by providing habitat for birds, pollinators such as bees, and other wildlife, which results in their numbers in population growing. There are countless ways in which wildlife gardens can be built or converted, as long as food, water, shelter, and space are provided. The process will usually involve removing invasive species to replace with native species, retaining leaf litter as well as mature trees, assuring varying distribution of vegetation complexity and structure, and implementing other habitat elements such as ponds to include water sources. True to the nature of a habitat in the wild varying depending on its environment and the species inhabiting it, a wildlife garden can be built to resemble a desired habitat, with strategic features meant to attract desired birds or pollinators.

==Habitats==
Building a successful garden suitable for local wildlife is best accomplished through the use of multiple three-dimensional habitats with diverse structures that provide places for animals to nest and hide. Wildlife gardens may contain a range of habitats, including:

Log piles – Preferably located in a shady area, a pile of logs is a sanctuary for insects and other invertebrates, as well as reptiles and amphibians. The organic structure is a shelter for both protection and breeding. In addition to logs, garden debris may also be added around the garden to be used as a natural mulch, fertilizer, weed control, soil amendment, and habitat for arthropod predators.
Bird feeding stations and bird houses – A place for birds to eat and take shelter will increase the number of birds in the garden, which play a key role in biological pest control. Not only will food and shelter increase the survival rate of birds, but it will also ensure that they are healthy enough for a successful breeding season.

Bug boxes and bee hotels – Bundles of hollow stems (elderberry, Joe-Pye weed, bamboo) can be hung up as an alternate place of shelter and breeding for beneficial insects, such as the Mason bee, which are valuable pollinators.

Sources of water – A water feature, such as a pond, has the potential to support a large biodiversity of wildlife. To maximize the amount of wildlife attracted to the water feature, it should consist of ranging depths. Shallow areas are used by birds to drink and by insects and amphibians to lay eggs. Deeper areas provide habitat for aquatic insects and a place for amphibians, or even fish to swim.

Pollinators – Flowers rich in nectar will attract bees and butterflies into the garden, which is of particular importance given the dramatic reduction in pollinator populations in the US, Europe and elsewhere. Wildflower meadows are an alternative option for lawns in the garden and will serve as a sanctuary for pollinators. However, pollinating plants should not be confused with plants suitable for butterfly breeding.

Plant diversity – The garden should include a range of plant types to act as different habitats. A balance between ground cover, shrub, understory, and canopy species will allow different sized wildlife shelters, varying in height, that fit their individual needs. It is particularly important to use species that are native to the area or state, as native plants will more reliably be suited to insects and other invertebrates than many non-native plants; increased variety of insects is valuable both for its own sake and for birds and other predators. Programs like the National Wildlife Federation&#x27;s Wildlife-Yard Certification program that provide certification to yards that contribute to the habitat of diverse species, provider higher native plant diversity, and diversify the bird population.

Horizontal structure is an important principle to plan when constructing habitats, as it is only natural that the landscape will gradually change over time due to the nature of wildlife gardening requiring less human maintenance such as mowing. Vegetation changes occur in successions, with a meadow eventually becoming a forest in its final stage after gradually being replaced with woody species; to achieve horizontal structure, vegetation must be arranged and interspersed in these different stages with some proximity, so that different wildlife species will be supported.

Vertical structure is also essential to the construction of the habitat. It is the inclusion of layers of plants that in such a way that it provides an efficient level of diversity as well as purpose in its arrangement. This is so that a broader arrangement of flora and fauna is provided. An example of a vertical structure is when a wildlife garden includes a mulch layer, herbaceous layer, shrub layer, tree layer. All layers can support various wildlife species as well as enhancing the diversity of plant life in a residential yard. Significant essential natural processes are also enhanced during the implementation of a vertical structure such as that of maintaining soil temperature, protection from erosion, decomposition, replenishment of nutrients, and additions to the food web.

==Choice of plants==
Although some exotics may also be included, as discussed in the previous section, wild gardens usually mostly feature a variety of native species. Generally, these will be a part of the pre-existing natural ecology of an area, making them easier to grow than most exotic species. Choosing native plants comes with an array of benefits for both plant and animal diversity, especially the ability to support native insect and fungal populations.
Ornamental plants on the market tend to lean toward &quot;pest-free&quot; plants, making it hard for native insects to adapt, and ultimately reducing their food supply. Decreases in insect populations due to excessive ornamental planting will discourage bird populations from inhabiting the particular area.

Invasive species can always prove problematic in the garden due to the absence of natural predators and their ability to reproduce rapidly. Without any measures of control, invasive species can easily overtake native species in the garden. Addressing invasive plants can be done a variety of ways; however, to ensure the least amount of damage to the surrounding ecosystem, this is best done by cutting down the plant, The debris from the invasive species can be piled and used as a home for smaller critters. In Australia, it has been found that invasive species such as Lantana (&quot;Lantana camara&quot;) can also provide refuge for bird species such as the superb fairywren (&quot;Malurus cyaneus&quot;) and silvereye (&quot;Zosterops lateralis&quot;), in the absence of native plant equivalents. Careful thought about how to balance invasive species management with what is best for urban biodiversity is needed for the best outcome in your garden.

A wildlife garden should be dense enough in native plant species that there is enough ground coverage for species varying in size to find cover (for hiding or shade amongst other things) and shelter. Creating shade is also important in any wildlife garden. Leaf litter, or material that has fallen from a plant on to the ground, creates the perfect mulch and fertilization for a wildlife garden. Leaf litter can soak up excess water from heavy rainfall during the fall and winter time, contain that moisture and slowly release it into surrounding native plants to help them during the spring and summer time. It may also be of help to added native forbs, herbaceous flowering plants, to provide additional food for the wildlife. In the US, some examples of native forbs would be species such as the tapertip hawksbeard &quot;(Crepis acuminata)&quot;&quot;,&quot; this yellow flowering plant is native and common in the west. The tapertip hawksbeard &quot;(Crepis acuminata)&quot; is low in abundance and is in need for the sage-grouse species to thrive.

== Complications with wildlife gardens ==
In theory, with proper planning, a wildlife garden can successfully provide habitat for desired wildlife and can attract many pollinators, essentially boosting local species biodiversity. However, a wildlife garden can also become a habitat sink, instead accomplishing the opposite of its intended purpose. Many wildlife gardens will have native vegetation planted due to the benefits it offers to the local fauna, as well as its convenience to humans because of its easy maintenance. It is important to consider when planning these gardens that if there are no similar native plants neighboring its intended location, the garden may indeed attract desired wildlife, but its visibility may also attract unwanted predators. As the local species population grows due to the newly provided habitat, predators may take advantage of the sudden influx in prey populations, and might show up unexpectedly to strike. In cases such as this, the wildlife garden instead becomes a habitat sink; thus it is important to plan carefully and take precautions, while always expecting the unexpected.

== Benefits of a wildlife garden ==
Beautifying your home or community, the satisfaction of creative effort, the health benefits of spending time outdoors are just some of the benefits of wildlife gardening. Research has found that a positive feedback loop is built as wildlife choose to visit and enjoy the wildlife gardens in people&#x27;s homes leaving the owners feeling a sense of satisfaction, fulfillment, and affirmation. Living in the city can result in a loss of connection with nature, and reduce the desire to seek this interaction in our daily lives. Having this disconnect with nature can impact the empathy and care we have for other species other than ourselves as we cannot see our impacts on them if we do not interact with them. Wildlife gardening can enhance urban biodiversity as well as connection to nature. If done in large enough proportions, wildlife gardens can form wildlife corridors. As there continues to be a decline in urban biodiversity it is said that wildlife gardens will need to be the new &#x27;nature,&#x27; gardening has now taken a role that transcend the needs of the gardener, they now instead will play a major role in sustaining the wildlife of our country, this will allow the owners of these wildlife gardens to truly make a difference.

=== Social and human well-being benefits ===
Wildlife gardeners report that wildlife gardening has provided them with benefits such as a reduction in stress and anxiety, an improvement in overall mental well-being, the act of making social connections, and the sense of accomplishment at the witness of their efforts proving successful once different species begin to interact with their gardens. There are also several known positive effects that come from interacting with nature, resulting in beneficial reactions from the human body. Immediate positive effects are an increased physical activity and mental stimulation from physical labor going into the gardens by humans, but there are positive effects that happen internally within the human body as well. Some examples include visual or olfactory contact with flora or any kind of nature, which stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system, and an association between an increase in attention in humans who experience plant and animal diversity, implying a reduction in anxiety.

== National Wildlife Habitat Certification ==
The U.S. National Wildlife Federation provides a Certified Wildlife Habitat program that&#x27;s main goal is to certify homeowners that provide additional habitat for wildlife that reside in urban areas dominated by the human population. In order to be a part of the program one must first fill out the certification application that the National Wildlife Federation has created. The application form includes a check-list that homeowners must check off when each element is providable to wildlife in their wildlife garden. There are five key components on the check-list: sustainable garden practices (such as being without harmful pesticides or fertilizers and practicing techniques such as composting), sources of food and water, places to take cover/hide, and space to raise potential offspring. It is important as well, when considering types of food to include to consider those from categories such as seeds from flowers or trees, nectar, twigs, fruit such as berries, pollen, and sap. There are additional specifications for each property depending on size of yard and region/area that the home is in. The Homeowner&#x27;s associations have also been working towards aiding the increase of biodiversity, specifically of plant and bird species, and encouraging participants and other homeowners to do so. Residential wildlife gardens can help strengthen connections between humans and the environment, between both its abiotic and biotic features. Wildlife gardens are very necessary to restoration efforts and with more efforts and collaborate work it can be even more effective as an urban footprint that helps offset the negative environmental effects of urban development. The National Wildlife Federation is also able to go far beyond certifying homeowner&#x27;s yards but also balconies (in apartments for example), workplaces (near or in the buildings) schools (class gardens or rooftops), farms, along with community gardens.

== In the Netherlands ==
Wildlife gardens in the Netherlands are called &quot;heemtuinen&quot;. The first was created in 1925: Thijsse&#x27;s Hof (Garden of Thijsse) in Bloemendaal, near Haarlem. It was given to Jac. P. Thijsse on the occasion of his 60th anniversary, and still exists today. The garden gives a display of about 800 plants native to the dune region of South Kennemerland, in which the garden is situated. It is said to be one of the oldest wildlife gardens of its sort in the world.

Nowadays, some 25 wildlife gardens exist in the Netherlands.

<doc id="227590" wikidata="Q3537758" url="?curid=227590" title="Radical transparency">
<text>Radical transparency is a phrase used across fields of governance, politics, software design and business to describe actions and approaches that radically increase the openness of organizational process and data. Its usage was originally understood as an approach or act that uses abundant networked information to access previously confidential organizational process or outcome data.

==History and uses==

Modern usage of the term radical transparency coincided with increased public use of Information communications technologies including the Internet. Kevin Kelly argued in 1994 that, “in the network era, openness wins, central control is lost.” David Brin&#x27;s writing on &quot;The Transparent Society&quot; re-imagined the societal consequences of radical transparency remixing Orwell&#x27;s &quot;1984&quot;. However, the explicit political argument for “radical transparency” was first made in a 2001 Foreign Affairs article on information and communication technology driving economic growth in developing regions. In 2006 Wired’s Chris Anderson blogged on the shift from secrecy to transparency blogging culture had made on corporate communications, and highlighted the next step as a shift to ‘radical transparency’ where the “whole product development process [is] laid bare, and opened to customer input.” By 2008 the term was being used to describe the WikiLeaks platform that radically decentralized the power, voices and visibility of governance knowledge that was previously secret.

==Contexts==

=== Radical corporate transparency===

Radical corporate transparency, as a philosophical concept, would involve removing all barriers to free and easy public access to corporate, political and personal (treating persons as corporations) information and the development of laws, rules, social connivance and processes that facilitate and protect such an outcome.

Using these methods to &#x27;hold corporations accountable for the benefit of everyone&#x27; was emphasised in Tapscott and Ticoll&#x27;s book &quot;The Naked Corporation&quot; in 2003. Radical transparency has also been explained by Dan Goleman as a management approach where (ideally,) all decision making is carried out publicly. Specific to this approach is the potential for new technologies to reveal the eco-impact of products bought to steer consumers to make informed decisions and companies to reform their business practices.

In traditional public relations management, damage control involved the suppression of public information. But, as observed by Clive Thompson in &quot;Wired&quot;, the Internet has created a force towards transparency:
&quot;[H]ere&#x27;s the interesting paradox: The reputation economy creates an incentive to be more open, not less. Since Internet commentary is inescapable, the only way to influence it is to be part of it. Being transparent, opening up, posting interesting material frequently and often is the only way to amass positive links to yourself and thus to directly influence your Googleable reputation. Putting out more evasion or PR puffery won&#x27;t work, because people will either ignore it and not link to it – or worse, pick the spin apart and enshrine &quot;those&quot; criticisms high on your Google list of life.&quot; Mark Zuckerberg has opined that &quot;more transparency should make for a more tolerant society in which people eventually accept that everybody sometimes does bad or embarrassing things.&quot;

=== Radical political transparency===
Heemsbergen argues that radical political transparency consists of actors outside of the structures of government, using new media forms, to disclose secrets to the public in ways that were previously unavailable and that create new expectations around how information should be used to govern. A prominent example of these evolutions of democracy was seen in the creation of &quot;Hansard&quot; in parliaments of the Westminster system, which started in pirate markets of pamphleteers illegally sharing the &#x27;secrets&#x27; of what was said in British Parliament. &quot;Hansard&quot; is now institutionalised in many parliaments, with full records of discussions in parliament recorded and published, while the texts of proposed laws and final laws are all, in principle, public documents.

Since the late 1990s, many national parliaments decided to publish all parliamentary debates and laws on the Internet. However, the initial texts of proposed laws and the discussions and negotiations regarding them generally occur in parliamentary commissions, which are rarely transparent, and among political parties, which are very rarely transparent. Moreover, given the logical and linguistic complexity of typical national laws, public participation is difficult despite the radical transparency at the formal parliamentary level.

Radical transparency has also been suggested in the context of government finance and public economics. In Missed Information, Sarokin and Schulkin take the concept even further, advocating for &quot;hypertransparency&quot; of government decision-making, a situation where all internal records, emails, meeting minutes and other internal information is proactively available to the public. Hypertransparency reverses the current Freedom of Information model of access only upon request, instead making all information available by default unless withheld for limited exemptions such as personal information or national security.

=== Radical educational transparency ===
A radically transparent approach is also emerging within education. Open educational resources (OER) are freely accessible, usually openly licensed documents and media that are useful for teaching, learning, educational, assessment and research purposes. Although some people consider the use of an open format to be an essential characteristic of OER, this is not a universally acknowledged requirement. In addition online courses activities are also becoming increasingly more accessible for others. One example are the new and popular massive open online courses (MOOC).

It is a compilation of two EPs released through Dublin based indie label Blunt Records – &quot;Paranoid from the Neck Down&quot; released 1 March 1993, and &quot;Spent&quot; released 5 January 1994. Two additional tracks recorded in 1994, &#x27;All Time Low&#x27; and &#x27;I Got Played&#x27;, as well as additional instrumental segues at the end of tracks 6 and 12, are only available on this release.

&#x27;Drop It&#x27; from the &quot;Paranoid from the Neck Down&quot; EP, and all tracks from the &quot;Spent&quot; EP, were remixed for this album. The spoken sample at the end of &#x27;Never Rest Again&#x27; fades out on this release.

The album was released on LP, CD and Cassette. Initial copies of the LP included a 7&quot; featuring &#x27;The Cleaver&#x27; and &#x27;Bangkok&#x27;, an Alex Chilton cover.

<text>The Tōkaidō Main Line () is one of the most important railway corridors in Japan, connecting the major cities of Tokyo and Kobe via Shizuoka, Nagoya, Kyoto and Osaka. The line, with termini at Tokyo and Kobe stations, is long, not counting its many freight feeder lines around the major cities. The high-speed Tōkaidō Shinkansen largely parallels the line.

The term &quot;Tōkaidō Main Line&quot; is largely a holdover from pre-Shinkansen days; now various portions of the line have different names which are officially used by JR East, JR Central, and JR West. Today, the only daily passenger train that travels the entire length of the line is the combined Sunrise Izumo/Sunrise Seto service which runs overnight. During the day, longer intercity trips using the line require several transfers along the way.

The Tokaido Main Line is owned and operated by three Japan Railways Group (JR Group) companies:
* East Japan Railway Company (JR East) ( - ) - [[Tōkaidō Line (JR East)|Tōkaidō Line]]
* Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central) ( - ) - [[Tōkaidō Line (Shizuoka area)|Tōkaidō Line]]
* West Japan Railway Company (JR West) ( - ) - [[Biwako Line]], [[JR Kyoto Line]], [[JR Kōbe Line|JR Kobe Line]]

==History==

=== Completion and early days, 1872–1913 ===

The Tōkaidō route takes its name from the ancient road connecting the Kansai region (Kyoto, Osaka) with the Kantō region (Tokyo, then Edo) through the Tōkai region (including Nagoya). Its name meant &quot;Tōkai road&quot;, or the road running through Tōkai. The Tōkaidō Line does not follow the old road exactly, since the latter diverges at Nagoya toward the Mie Prefecture coastline; to follow it by train, the Kansai Main Line and Kusatsu Line would have to be followed from Nagoya to Kusatsu. Japan&#x27;s largest population centers are all along this route: Tokyo, Yokohama, Nagoya, Kyoto, Osaka, and Kobe. Since construction of the line, these centers have since grown to occupy an ever more dominant role in the country&#x27;s government, financial, manufacturing, and cultural life.

Historically, one of the first priorities of Japanese railway planners was to build a line from Tokyo to the Kansai region, either following the Tokaido route or the northern Nakasendō route. This decision remained unresolved as regional needs were addressed. The first railway in Japan was the line from Shimbashi to Sakuragicho in Yokohama, which opened in 1872; another segment of today&#x27;s Tokaido Main Line, between Kyoto and Kobe, opened in 1877.

In 1883, the government decided to use the Nakasendō route, and construction of several segments commenced (including the modern-day Takasaki Line). Railways were opened between Ogaki and Nagahama (1884) and between Nagoya and Kisogawa (1886) in line with the Nakasendo plan. However, by 1886, it was clear that the Tokaido route would be more practical, and so the Nakasendo plan was abandoned.

The lines between Kisogawa and Ogaki, Yokohama and Kozu, and Hamamatsu and Obu were completed in 1887, and the first line from Tokyo to Kobe was completed in 1889, when Kozu and Hamamatsu were connected through the present-day Gotemba Line corridor. The final segments were completed between Kasumigahara and Otsu. At the time, there was one Tokyo–Kobe train in each direction per day, taking over 20 hours each way. The &quot;Tokaido Line&quot; name was formally adopted in 1895. In October 1895, following the Sino-Japanese War, through service to the Sanyo Railway (now the San&#x27;yō Main Line) began.

Express service between Tokyo and Kobe began in 1896, sleeper service in 1900, and dining car service in 1901. In 1906, all privately run main lines were nationalized under the newly created Japanese Government Railways, which at the time had a network of just over of track. 

=== Capacity expansion and route changes, 1914–1945 ===
On 20 December 1914, Tokyo Station opened and succeeded Shinbashi Station as the Tokyo-side terminus of the line. On the same day, an electrified commuter line was inaugurated along the section between Tokyo Station and today’s Yokohama Station, which is now part of the Keihin–Tōhoku Line. Automatic couplers were introduced on all freight wagons in 1926. In 1930, the first &quot;Tsubame&quot; (&quot;swallow&quot;) express was introduced, reducing the Tokyo - Kobe travel-time to nine hours - a significant reduction from the twenty hours required in 1889 and fifteen in 1903.
By the start of the Taishō era, route changes on several stretches of the line were deemed necessary to accommodate growing demand. The route bypassing Osakayama (between Ōtsu and Kyoto Stations), in use since 1878, was closed when the current, less steep route with two long tunnels was completed on 25 September 1919. The mountainous Gotemba stretch required an even larger-scale route change, culminating in the completion of the Tanna Tunnel in 1934 after 15 years of construction. The new route through the tunnel is 11.2 kilometres long, compared to the old Gotemba route, which took a 60.2-kilometre detour around the Tanna Basin. With the opening of the tunnel, the section between Tokyo and Numazu was fully electrified, as steam locomotives were unable to operate through the long tunnel safely.

Electrification also progressed on the other end of the line around the same time, in 1934. Commuter rapid services between Kyoto and Kobe, using 52 Series streamliner EMUs, began in 1937. However, further electrification of the line was overshadowed by the Second World War and did not resume until after the war. For security reasons, the army preferred to keep the middle portion of the line unelectrified, as unelectrified tracks were much easier to repair in the event of an enemy attack.

During the war, the line&#x27;s focus shifted towards freight services. Express services were significantly reduced, and sleepers and restaurant cars were withdrawn from service in 1944. JNR Class D52 locomotives were introduced for wartime freight transport, but their poor manufacturing quality led to several boiler explosion accidents.

=== As the main transport artery of postwar Japan, 1945–1964 ===

In the immediate aftermath of the war, almost all surviving express train carriages were requisitioned by the Allied Occupation Forces. Services such as the &quot;Allied Limited&quot; (Tokyo–Moji), &quot;Dixie Limited&quot; (Tokyo–Hakata), and the &quot;BCOF Train&quot; (Tokyo–Kure) operated on the Tōkaidō Line. Express trains for Japanese nationals resumed in April 1947, with sleeper services following in July 1948.

In 1949, the Limited Express &quot;Heiwa&quot;, a successor to the pre-war &quot;Tsubame&quot; service, and the sleeper express &quot;Ginga&quot; both began operating between Tokyo and Osaka. In January 1950, &quot;Heiwa&quot; was renamed &quot;Tsubame&quot;. Makeshift D52 freight locomotives were converted into C62 express locomotives, the largest and fastest steam engines in Japan&#x27;s rail history, to haul these services. One of the C62s, C62 17, holds the narrow-gauge steam world speed record, which was achieved on the Tokaido line near Nagoya on 15 December 1954, and is preserved at the SCMaglev and Railway Park.

On 19 November 1956, the line was fully electrified. The Tokyo–Osaka express trains, &quot;Tsubame&quot; and &quot;Hato&quot;, began to be hauled by JNR EF58 locomotives for the entire length of the route, reducing travel time from 8 hours to 7 hours and 30 minutes. With no concerns about smoke polluting the carriages, these trains were painted light green and nicknamed &quot;Aodaishō&quot; (green snakes, referring to the Japanese rat snake).

On 1 October 1958, the &quot;Kodama&quot;, the first limited express service operated by EMUs rather than locomotive-hauled carriages, commenced. This service further reduced travel time to 6 hours and 50 minutes. The Series 151 EMUs marked a significant milestone in railway technology, as EMUs were previously considered unsuitable for high-speed and long-distance services due to issues like noise, vibration, and cost. Since then, all non-sleeper express rolling stock, including the Shinkansen, has been designed as EMUs. On the same day, the &quot;Asakaze&quot; sleeper express entered service with the newly built Series 20 carriages. These carriages were fully air-conditioned and nicknamed the &#x27;hotel on the rail&#x27;. Because these sleeper carriages and their successors were painted blue, sleeper trains in Japan came to be known as &quot;Blue Trains&quot;.

=== After the opening of the Tōkaidō Shinkansen, 1964–1987 ===
The capacity constraints on the Tokaido Main Line had been clear prior to World War II, and work started on a new standard gauge &quot;bullet train&quot; line in 1940. Intercity passenger traffic between Tokyo, Nagoya and Osaka largely transferred to the Tōkaidō Shinkansen after it was completed in 1964. Since then, the Tokaido Main Line has been used as a commuter and freight line, serving a very small number of long-distance passenger trains (mainly overnight and sleeper services).

=== Privatisation, 1987–present ===
Following the Hanshin earthquake on 17 January 1995, the line was shut down between Takatsuki and Kobe, with certain segments remaining impassable until 1 April of that year.

On 20 August 2016, station numbering was introduced, with stations between Tokyo and Ōfuna assigned station numbers of JT01 to JT07. Numbers increase towards in the southbound direction towards Ōfuna. Station numbers would be assigned to stations beyond Ōfuna as far as Atami in 2018.

On the evening of 5 August 2023, a JR East Tokaido Line service struck a utility pole near and lost power, resulting in a suspension of service. Four people, including the driver, sustained minor injuries. Service was restored on the morning of 6 August 2023.

== Station list ==

=== JR East ===
The section between Tokyo and Atami is operated by East Japan Railway Company (JR East) and it is located in the Greater Tokyo Area. It has local services () and a rapid service called &quot;Rapid Acty&quot; (). It runs on dedicated tracks parallel to the Yamanote Line between Tokyo and Shinagawa, the Keihin–Tōhoku Line between Tokyo and Yokohama, and the Yokosuka Line between Yokohama and Ōfuna. Some Shōnan–Shinjuku Line trains share the segment south of Yokohama to Ōfuna and Odawara. Until 12 March 2021, there were also commuter rapid () and Shōnan Liner () services.

The Ueno–Tokyo Line, a JR East project, extended the services of the Utsunomiya Line, the Takasaki Line, and the Joban Line to Tokyo Station, allowing for through services to and from the Tōkaidō Line from March 2015.

Almost all trains along this section of the line have bi-level &quot;Green Cars&quot; with forward-facing seats, with each set of trains having 2 of them. Green Cars can be used after paying an additional fee.

A new station between Ōfuna and Fujisawa is being planned to serve passengers near the former JR Freight &quot;Shōnan Freight Terminal. C&quot;onstruction is expected to start in early 2022. The new station is expected to open for service in 2032.

Legend:
* ● : All trains stop
*｜ : All trains pass
* ▲ : Shōnan–Shinjuku Line trains use Yokosuka Line platforms

* Some trains run through services beyond Atami, as far as Numazu. 
*With the Ueno–Tokyo Line, Utsunomiya Line Rapid &quot;Rabbit&quot; and Takasaki Line Rapid &quot;Urban&quot; services now run along the Tokaido Line, and stop at all stations on this line. As such, the two services are classified as &#x27;Local&#x27; service trains within the Tokaido Line. 
*Tokaido Line Rapid &quot;Acty&quot; services operate only evening services from Tokyo to Odawara. Rapid &quot;Acty&quot; services will be discontinued effective the timetable revision on 18 March 2023 after 34 years of operation.
*&quot;Shōnan&quot; Limited Express services are special, all-reserved commuter express trains with comfortable seating. They operate from Odawara to Tokyo on weekday mornings, with a few services terminating in Shinagawa. Return services run from Tokyo to Odawara on weekday evenings. Like commuter rapid trains, Shōnan Liner services normally make no stops between Shinagawa and Fujisawa. Between Fujisawa and Odawara, varying stops are made. In addition to the standard fare, a reserved seat fee of ¥500 is required to use the &quot;Shōnan Liner&quot;.
* Keihin-Tōhoku Line stations between Tokyo and Yokohama officially are a part of the Tōkaidō Main Line. These stations are: , , , , , , , , , and .
* Yokosuka Line stations between Tokyo and Ōfuna officially are a part of the Tōkaidō Main Line. These stations are: , , , , and . The route of the Yokosuka Line between Shinagawa and Tsurumi is separate from the main line and is referred to as the Hinkaku Line, on which Nishi-Ōi, Musashi-Kosugi, and Shin-Kawasaki stations are located.
* The Shōnan–Shinjuku Line operates through services to the Tōkaidō Main Line. Trains operate from the Takasaki Line to and enter the Yokosuka Line at to then switches tracks to the Tōkaidō Main Line towards , and vice versa. Rapid Service stop at all stations on the Tōkaidō Main Line (Totsuka - Odawara), while Special Rapid Service operate the same pattern as a &quot;Rapid Acty&quot; Service.

=== JR Central ===
The point between JR East and JR Central operation is divided at Atami Station. The section of the line between Atami and Maibara is operated by JR Central, and covers the Tōkai region: Shizuoka Prefecture, Aichi Prefecture, and Gifu Prefecture. Some services from Odawara on the JR East section continues to travel on this section until Numazu Station.

==== Shizuoka Block ====
==== Nagoya Block Main Line ====

Maibara is shared by JR Central and JR West; JR West manages the station

Before March 2016, JR West operated trains from Maibara as far as Ogaki on JR Central territory. After the two companies realized this invasion, on 25 March 2016, all JR West departures were changed to JR Central trains to Maibara station.

====Branch lines====

Both the Mino-Akasaka and Tarui branch lines separate from the Main Line at , located 3.1 km west of Ōgaki Station.

=====Mino-Akasaka Branch Line=====
=====Tarui Branch Line=====
Between Ōgaki and Sekigahara, there is a 25 per mil grade. In 1944, a single track bypass (in brown on the diagram) was built to avoid this steep slope of the main line. The old section, informally referred to as the &quot;Shin-Tarui Line&quot;, remains largely unused, and was closed in 1986. Today, the only rail vehicles that travel on this section of track are freight trains and westbound express trains (the Shirasagi, Hida #36, and Sunrise Seto/Izumo services).

===JR West===
The western part of the Tōkaidō Main Line from Maibara to Kōbe is operated by JR West and forms the main trunk of the company&#x27;s Urban Network in the Osaka-Kobe-Kyoto metropolitan area. Although the line is divided into three segments, known as the Biwako Line, JR Kyoto Line, and JR Kobe Line, they are part of a single contiguous network, with many services traversing multiple sections. The Biwako Line includes a segment of the Hokuriku Main Line. Some services on the Kosei, JR Takarazuka and Gakkentoshi lines run through onto the Tōkaidō Main Line.

==== Biwako Line ====

The section between Maibara and Kyoto is known as the Biwako Line.

*●: Trains stop.
*○: Limited stop, early morning and late night only
*|: Trains pass.
*Local (4-door Commuter trains): JR Kyoto Line local trains
*Local (3-door Suburban trains): Operate as Rapid service trains west of Takatsuki (west of Kyoto in the morning)

==== JR Kyoto Line ====

The section between Kyoto and Osaka is known as the JR Kyoto Line. Trains from the Biwako and Kosei lines travel through onto the JR Kyoto Line and continue west towards the JR Kobe Line at Osaka.

Legend:

* ● : All trains stop
* | : All trains pass
* ▲ : Trains only after morning rush stop

Local trains stop at all stations. Rapid trains in the morning skip some stops between Kyoto and Takatsuki.

==== JR Kobe Line ====

The westernmost section between Osaka and Kōbe is part of the JR Kobe Line, which continues west to on the San&#x27;yō Main Line. Although Kōbe is the official terminus of the Tōkaidō Main Line, most trains continue to Nishi-Akashi, Himeji and beyond.

===Former connecting lines===

====Kanagawa Prefecture====
* Ninomiya Station: The Shonan Horse-drawn Tramway opened a line to Hatano in 1906 to haul tobacco. Steam locomotion was introduced in 1913. Passenger services ceased in 1933, and the line closed in 1935.
* Odawara Station: The Japan Tobacco and Salt Public Corporation operated an approximately 1 km line to its factory, electrified at 1,500 V DC, between 1950 and 1984. The line was also serviced by the adjoining Odakyu Odawara Line from its Ashigara station.

====Shizuoka Prefecture====
* Atami Station: In 1895, a gauge handcar line opened to Yoshihama, and was extended to Odawara the following year. In 1907, the line was converted to gauge and steam locomotives were introduced. The line closed in 1923 as a result of the Great Kanto earthquake.
* Numazu Station: The Sunzu Electric Railway opened a line to Mishima-Tamachi on the Izuhakone Railway Sunzu Line in 1906. In 1915, the line was truncated 1 km to connect at Mishima-Hirokoji, and the line was electrified at 600 V DC in 1919. The line closed in 1961 following the destruction of the Kisegawa bridge during a flood.
* Yoshiwara Station: The opened a gauge line to Ōmiya (presentday Fujinomiya) in 1890. The purchased the tramway in 1912, converted it to a gauge steam railway the following year and gradually extended it (eventually becoming the Minobu Line). In 1924, the company built a new alignment which connected to Fuji station on the Tokaido main line, at which time the original section from Omiya to Yoshiwara closed.
* Shimizu Station: Shimizukō Line from 1916 to 1984.
* Shizuoka Station:
** The Abe Railway opened a gauge line from Inomiya (approximately 2 km from Shizuoka) to Ushizuma in 1914 to haul timber. Plans to extend the line to Shizuoka did not eventuate and the line closed in 1934.
**The Shizuoka Electric Railway opened a line to Anzai, connecting to its Shimizu Line, electrified at 600 V DC, between 1922 and 1926. The line closed in 1962.
* Yaizu Station: A handcar line operated to Fujieda between 1891 and 1900.
* Fujieda Station: The Tōsō Railway opened a gauge line to Ote in 1913, and by 1926 had extended the line progressively in both directions for a length of from Jitogata to Suruga-Okabe, although in 1936 the section from Suruga-Okabe to Ote was closed. In 1943, the company merged with the Shizuoka Railway (see Fujiroi Station below), and in 1948, a line between Mitsumata and Jitogata opened, linking the two sections. This section of the combined line closed between 1964 and 1970.
* Shimada Station: The Fuji Prefectural Government opened a gauge handcar line in 1898 to haul timber. In 1944, following the destruction of the nearby Tokaido Line bridge over the Oigawa, it was proposed to use the alignment of this line as a replacement, including a wooden bridge over the river. The bridge was about 25% completed when the end of the war resulted in the termination of the proposal. A diesel locomotive was introduced in 1955 to haul construction material for the construction of the adjacent national highway, and the line closed in 1959.
* Kikukawa Station: The Joto horse-drawn tramway opened a gauge line to Ikeshinden in 1899. In 1923, the line was converted to gauge, and a single-cylinder diesel locomotive introduced. The line closed in 1935.
* Fukuroi Station:
**The Akiba horse-drawn tramway opened a gauge line to Enshumori-Cho in 1902. In 1926, the company renamed itself the Shizuoka Electric Railway, converted the line to gauge and electrified it at 600 V DC. The line closed in 1962.
**The Shizuoka Railway opened a gauge line to Yokosuka in 1914, extending it to Mitsumata in 1927. The company merged with the Fuji-sho Railway in 1943 (see Fujieda Station above), and in 1948, a line between Mitsumata and Jitogata opened, linking the two sections. This section of the combined line closed between 1964 and 1967.
* Hamamatsu Station: The Dainippon Railway opened a , gauge line to Kuniyoshi in 1909. In 1919, the line was acquired by the Enshu Railway Line, which closed the first of the line in 1925, so the new connecting station became Enshu-Magome. The line closed in 1937 while the section to Enshu-Magome would close in 1985.

====Aichi Prefecture====
* Okazaki Station:
** The Nishio Railway opened a gauge line to Nishio in 1911, and extended it to Kira-Yoshida on the Meitetsu Gamagōri Line between 1915 and 1916. In 1926, the company merged with the Aichi Electric Railway, which between 1928 and 1929 converted the line to gauge, electrified it at 600 V DC, and connected it to the line from Shin-Anjō on the Meitetsu Nagoya Main Line at Nishioguchi. The line to Nishio closed in 1962.
**A tram line connected to the Meitetsu Koromo line at Okazaki-Ida Station, which between 1929 and 1962 connected to the Meitetsu Mikawa Line at Uwagoromo, the tramway also closing in 1962.
* Owari-Ichinomiya Station: The Meitetsu line to Okoshi, electrified at 600 V DC, opened in 1924. When the voltage on the Meitetsu main line was increased to 1,500 V DC in 1952, services were suspended on this line. The substitute bus service proved so popular the line was closed rather than upgraded.

====Gifu Prefecture====
* Ogaki Station: The Seino Railway opened a line from Mino-Akasaka to Ichihashi in 1928, and operated a passenger service from 1930 to 1945.
* Arao Station (on the Mino Akasaka branch): A freight-only line to the Mino Okubo limestone quarry operated between 1928 and 1990.

====Hyōgo Prefecture====

<doc id="227596" wikidata="Q473058" url="?curid=227596" title="Hankyu">
<text>, trading as , is a Japanese private railway company that provides commuter and interurban service to the northern Kansai region and is one of the flagship properties of Hankyu Hanshin Holdings Inc., in turn part of the Hankyu Hanshin Toho Group (which includes H2O Retailing Corporation and Toho Co., the creator of &quot;Godzilla&quot;). The railway&#x27;s main terminal is at Umeda Station in Osaka. The signature color of Hankyu cars is maroon.

The Hankyu network serves 1,950,000 people every weekday and offers several types of express service with no extra charge.

The head offices of Hankyu Hanshin Holdings, Inc. and Hankyu Corporation are at 1-16-1, Shibata, Kita-ku, Osaka; both companies&#x27; registered headquarters are at Ikeda Station, 1-1, Sakaemachi, Ikeda, Osaka Prefecture.

The Takarazuka Revue, an all-female musical theatre performance company, is well known as a division of the Hankyu railway company; all of its members are employed by Hankyu.

==History==
===Etymology===
The name is an abbreviation of .

 refers to the area served by Hankyu trains, comprising the cities of , and , along with the suburbs that connect them to each other.

 means &quot;express train(s)&quot;.

===Foundation===
In 1907, the , a forerunner of Hankyu Hanshin Holdings, Inc., was established by Ichizō Kobayashi (precisely, he was one of the &quot;promoters&quot; of the tramway).
On 10 March 1910, Minoo Arima Tramway opened the rail lines from Umeda to Takarazuka (the Takarazuka Main Line) and from Ishibashi to Minoo (the Minoo Line). The tramway was popular due to Kobayashi&#x27;s pioneering act to develop housing around stations along the line (a first in Japan), a forerunner to transit-oriented developments.

=== Expansion to Kobe ===
On February 4, 1918, Minoo Arima Tramway was renamed .

On July 16, 1920, the Kobe Main Line from Jūsō to Kobe (later, renamed Kamitsutsui) and the Itami Line from Tsukaguchi to Itami were opened.

On April 1, 1936, the Kobe Main Line was extended from Nishi-Nada (present-day Ōji-kōen) to the new terminal in Kobe (present-day Kobe-Sannomiya Station), and the Kobe Main Line from Nishi-Nada to Kamitsutsui was named the Kamitsutsui Line, which was abandoned on May 20, 1940.

In 1936, Hankyu established a professional baseball team and in 1937 the Nishinomiya Stadium as the team&#x27;s home field was completed near Nishinomiya-Kitaguchi Station. The Hankyu Braves (named in 1947) played until the 1988 season and became the predecessors of the present-day Orix Buffaloes.

=== Merger and separation with Keihan ===
On October 1, 1943, under the order of the government, Hanshin Kyūkō and Keihan Electric Railway were merged, and renamed . The merged lines included the Keihan Main Line, the Uji Line, the Shinkeihan Line (present-day Kyoto Main Line), the Senriyama Line (present-day Senri Line), the Jūsō Line (part of Kyoto Main Line), the Arashiyama Line, the Keishin Line and the Ishiyama Sakamoto Line. The Katano Line was also added in 1945.

On December 1, 1949, the Keihan Main Line, the Katano Line, the Uji Line, the Keishin Line, and the Ishiyama-Sakamoto Line were split off to become part of the newly established Keihan Electric Railway Co., Ltd. Although this revived the former Keihan Electric Railway, Keihan was now smaller than before the 1943 merger, because the Shinkeihan Line and its branches were not given up by Keihanshin. The present structure of the Hankyu network with the three main lines was fixed by this transaction. The abbreviation of Keihanshin Kyūkō Railway was changed from &quot;Keihanshin&quot; to &quot;Hankyū&quot;.

=== Postwar development ===

On April 7, 1968, the Kobe Main Line started through service to the Kobe Rapid Transit Railway Tozai Line and the Sanyo Electric Railway Main Line.

On December 6, 1969, the Kyoto Main Line and the Senri Line started through service to the Osaka Municipal Subway Sakaisuji Line. In 1970, the Senri Line was one of access routes to the Expo &#x27;70 held in Senri area.

On April 1, 1973, Keihanshin Kyūkō Railway Company assumed its current name.

On April 1, 2005, former Hankyu Corporation became a holding company and was renamed . The railway business was ceded to a subsidiary, now named Hankyu Corporation (before the restructuring, the new company which reused a dormant company founded on December 7, 1989, was called until March 28, 2004, then from the next day).

On October 1, 2006, Hankyu Holdings became the wholly owning parent company of Hanshin Electric Railway Co., Ltd. and the holdings were renamed Hankyu Hanshin Holdings, Inc.. Hankyu&#x27;s stock purchase of Hanshin shares was completed on June 20, 2006.

== Rail lines ==
Hankyu operates three main trunk lines, connecting Osaka with Kobe, Takarazuka and Kyoto respectively, and their branches.

:

The three groups of the lines, the Kobe Lines, the Takarazuka Lines and the Kyoto Lines, can be further grouped into two, the Kobe-Takarazuka Lines and the Kyoto Lines from a historical reason. Hankyu has two groups of rolling stock, one for the Kobe-Takarazuka Lines and the other for the Kyoto Lines.

=== Former lines ===
====Abandoned lines====
*Kitano Line (Umeda – Kitano)
*Kamitsutsui Line (Nishi-Nada (Ōji-kōen) – Kamitsutsui)

====Transferred lines====
*Keihan Line
**Keihan Main Line ( – )
**Katano Line ( – )
**Uji Line ( – )
*Ōtsu Line
**Keishin Line (Sanjō – )
**Ishiyama Sakamoto Line ( – )
The Keihan and Ōtsu Lines were transferred to Keihan Electric Railway Co., Ltd. which separated from Keihanshin Kyūkō (now Hankyu) on December 1, 1949.

==Rolling stock==

, Hankyu had 1,319 cars for passenger service. Standard cars have three pairs of doors per side and bench seating facing the center of the train (exceptions are noted below). The Kobe Line and Takarazuka Line use the same fleet.

Some former Hankyu trains, such as the 2000 series and 3100 series, have been transferred to the Nose Electric Railway.

===Kobe Line/Takarazuka Line===
* 1000 series
* 3000 series
* 3100 series
* 5000 series
* 5100 series
* 6000 series
* 7000 series
* 8000 series (includes small number of transverse seating cars)
* 8200 series
* 9000 series

===Kyoto Line===
* 1300 series (from spring 2014)
* 2300 series
* 3300 series
* 5300 series
* 6300 series (two doors per side, transverse seating)
* 7300 series
* 8300 series
* 9300 series (transverse seating)

==Fares==
Single fare (adult) in Japanese Yen by travel distance is as follows. Fares for children (6–11 years old) are half the adult fare, rounded up to the nearest 10 yen. 

For fare collection, IC cards (PiTaPa, ICOCA and others) are accepted.

The fare rate was changed on April 1, 2014, to reflect the change in the rate of consumption tax from 5% to 8%, and again on October 1, 2019, from 8% to 10%.

== In popular culture ==
A 2-car Hankyu train was featured in the 1988 Japanese animated war drama &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot;.

Hankyu trains appear in the Japanese animated series &quot;The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya&quot;.

One 2008 book by the Japanese writer Hiro Arikawa, , occurs entirely on the Hankyu–Imazu line, in the north-west suburbs of Osaka, where various characters meet and interact in the trains and at the various stations of the line. It was made into a film in 2011, titled &quot;Hankyu Railway: A 15-Minute Miracle&quot;.

The Hankyu 2000 is the locomotive of choice for Takumi Fujiwara, the main character in Densha de D, a parody of Initial D where the main characters race with trains instead of cars.

<doc id="227598" wikidata="Q1191886" url="?curid=227598" title="Umeda Station">
<text>is a major railway station in Kita-ku in the northern commercial center of Osaka, Japan. It is the busiest station in western Japan, serving 2,343,727 passengers daily in 2005.

Umeda Station is served by the following railways:

*Hankyu Railway (Kōbe Line, Kyōto Line, Takarazuka Line) - Osaka-umeda Station
*Hanshin Electric Railway (Main Line) - Osaka Umeda Station
*Osaka Metro (Midōsuji Line, Station number: M16)

The freight terminal of Japan Freight Railway Company (JR Freight) (Umeda Freight Branch of Tōkaidō Main Line), closed in 2013, was also called Umeda. Portions of this line was moved underground in 2023.

The nearby stations (JR West), (JR West Tōzai Line), (Osaka Subway Yotsubashi Line, Y11) and (Osaka Subway Tanimachi Line, T20) are within walking distance and connected by a large complex of underground malls.

==Hanshin Railway==
The underground Umeda terminal of Hanshin Electric Railway (officially Osaka-Umeda Station, but commonly called Hanshin Osaka-Umeda Station) is located south of Ōsaka Station, next to underground of Hanshin Department Store. The Hanshin station first opened on December 21, 1906 as a ground level station and moved to the present underground location on March 21, 1939.

===Layout===
There are five bay platforms and four tracks on the second basement. There are east ticket gates on the second basement and center ticket gates and west ticket gates on the first basement.

===Adjacent stations of Hanshin Osaka-Umeda===



==Hankyu Railway==
The Umeda terminal of Hankyu Railway (officially Osaka-umeda Station, but commonly called Hankyu Osaka-umeda Station) is located northeast of Ōsaka Station.

The station first opened on March 10, 1910, as a ground-level station. The original location of the station was southeast of Ōsaka Station and the Hankyu (then Minoo-Arima Electric Tramway) tracks crossed the Tōkaidō Main Line by an overpass. The station was elevated on July 5, 1926.

When Osaka Station was elevated in 1934, Hankyu&#x27;s elevated tracks were forced to be removed and new Umeda Station was built to handle new ground-level tracks. The switching of tracks were carried out on June 1, 1934. This station facility was used until November 28, 1971, when the move of station to the present location was completed. This move was because of a sharp increase of transit, which forced Hankyu to operate 8-car trains. The existence of JNR tracks on the northern end of the 1934 station prevented the expansion of the station so that the station could not handle long trains.

After the opening of the current huge elevated station, spaces around and beneath the station, as well as the site of former station, were extensively redeveloped. One of the symbols of the commercial complex surrounding the station is the BIG MAN video screen above the Kinokuniya bookshop, common and necessary places to meet in this bustling railway station.

The Hankyu Department Store, built next to the station in 1929, was a pioneer of the successful business model of department stores run by urban railway companies in Japan. The store is still in business at the original location even after the move of the station (as of 2007, the reconstruction of the store building is in progress).

Station numbering was introduced to all Hankyu stations on 21 December 2013 with this station being designated as station number HK-01.

===Layout===
There are ten bay platforms serving nine tracks on the third floor. There are south ticket gates on the third floor and center ticket gates and on Chayamachi ticket gates on the second floor.

==Osaka Metro==
Umeda is the transferring point of three lines of the metro: the Midōsuji Line, the Tanimachi Line and the Yotsubashi Line. Among them, only the Midōsuji Line station is named Umeda, with the station number M16. The Tanimachi Line station is Higashi-Umeda (meaning &quot;East Umeda&quot;) and the Yotsubashi Line station is Nishi-Umeda (meaning &quot;West Umeda&quot;). These three stations are connected with each other by underground walkways. Regular tickets of the subway, Surutto Kansai cards and IC cards are valid until the passenger gets out the ticket barrier of the station. The transfer between the three Umeda stations is an exception of this principle; the fare can be calculated as one travel as if the passengers do not exit the station provided the passengers transfer within 30 minutes.

Umeda Station on the Midōsuji Line started its operation on May 20, 1933, as a temporary station. The station was moved to the present location on October 6, 1935. Originally the station with an island platform and two tracks was built amid one tunnel, but on November 5, 1989, the station was expanded to a tunnel that existed next to the station (built for Tanimachi Line but due to change of plan remained unused for decades). The two tunnels are separated by a wall with some passages.

===Layout===

*There is an island platform with two tracks on the second basement. There is a wall with passages in the center of the platform. On the upper level of the platform, there are north, center-north-west, center-north-east, center-south and south ticket gates.
&lt;br&gt;
==Japan Freight Railway==
Umeda Freight Terminal of Japan Freight Railway Company (JR Freight) was a freight terminal on the Umeda Branchline (unofficial name) of the Tōkaidō Main Line owned by West Japan Railway Company (JR West). The station was built to separate freight services from Ōsaka Station and began operation on December 1, 1928. The yard of the terminal was located to the north, literally in the backyard, of the Ōsaka Station.

The freight terminal ceased to handle freight on March 16, 2013 and its function was succeeded by newly established and other nearby yards. The station was officially closed on March 31, 2013. The site, commonly called or , will be redeveloped.

A portion of the line was moved underground in 2023, resulting in an addition of underground passenger platforms at Ōsaka Station which was previously bypassed. The JR West Limited Express trains still use the freight line to transfer from the Osaka Loop Line to the JR Kyoto Line. No passenger trains had stopped at Umeda Freight Station itself.

<text>The of Hankyu Railway is one of the three major commuter heavy rail lines in the Keihanshin conurbation of Japan. It links the urban centres of Osaka and Kobe by connecting the major stations of Umeda in Osaka and Sannomiya in Kobe.

The Hanshin Electric Railway Main Line and West Japan Railway Company (JR West) Tokaido Main Line (this section nicknamed JR Kobe Line) are the two lines parallel to the Hankyu Kobe Line within a short distance of each other.

==Definition==
The line is commonly called for short, but in the broader sense &#x27;Kobe Line&#x27; refers to the entire network of the trunk Kobe Main Line and connecting branch lines of Itami, Imazu and Kōyō Lines.

==Network==
At the Kobe end of the line some trains continue through onto the Kobe Rapid Railway, an underground line allowing interchange between the lines of several commuter rail companies operating in Kobe.

The Kobe Main Line has interchanges at several of its stations with other lines operated by Hankyu. The Hankyu main lines to Kyoto and Takarazuka share stations at Umeda and Juso with the Kobe Line. The other lines with connections to the Kobe line are smaller lines with only local trains: the Itami Line connects at Tsukaguchi, the Imazu Line at Nishinomiya-kitaguchi and the Koyo Line at Shukugawa.

==History==
The Umeda - Juso section was opened in 1910 as part of the Hankyu Takarazuka Line.

The Juso - Oji-Koen section opened as a 1435mm gauge line electrified at in 1920. In 1926 the line was duplicated, and in 1936 it was extended to Kobe Sannomiya. In 1967 the voltage was increased to .

Until 1936, the line&#x27;s terminal in Kobe was in Kamitsutsui. As a branch of the main line, the line between Oji-Koen Station and Kamitsutsui Station continued to provide a connection to the Kobe tram network until 1941.

The Kobe Main Line was damaged by the Great Hanshin earthquake in January 1995. Restoration work on the Kobe Line took 7 months to complete.

Station numbering was introduced on 21 December 2013.

=== Future plans ===
A new station will be built near the Muko River between Nishinomiya-Kitaguchi and Tsukaguchi. The project, which includes a bicycle parking lot and reconstruction of the surrounding roads, is expected to cost . Agreements to build the station were signed by the railway and the national treasury was signed in October 2022.

==Train services==
During the day, only local trains (普通) and limited express trains (特急) which stop only at major stations along the line, are operated. Other commuter and express services operate only early mornings, commuting times, and late nights.
*Local trains (普通) stop at all stations, all times of the day. Most operate between Osaka-Umeda and Kobe-Sannomiya, but some start and end at Nishinomiya-Kitaguchi. 
*Semi-Express trains (準急) are operated from Takarazuka to Osaka-Umeda via the Imazu Line and the Kobe Line on weekday mornings.
*Commuter Express trains (通勤急行) operate on weekdays, from Kobe-Sannomiya to Osaka-Umeda in the morning, and from Osaka-Umeda to Kobe-Sannomiya in the evening rush hour.
*Express trains (急行) operate from Osaka-Umeda to Kobe-Sannomiya or Shinkaichi late nights, as well as one eastbound train on weekend mornings.
*Semi-Limited Express (準特急) operate from Osaka-Umeda to Kosoku Kobe or Shinkaichi in the evenings as well as one early morning train towards Osaka-Umeda.
*Commuter Limited Express trains (通勤特急) operate in both directions on weekday mornings. Some trains consist of 10 cars, of which the last car (to Osaka-Umeda) or the first car (to Kobe-Sannomiya) is for women only.
*Limited Express trains (特急) operate in both directions, all day except early morning and late night.
*Maximum speed:

<text>Kobe-Sannomiya Station (), or simply Sannomiya Station (), is a major interchange station located in the Sannomiya area in the heart of Kobe, Japan. This station is the main transport hub of Kobe.

== Lines ==
Sannomiya is served by the following railway lines and stations:
*Hanshin Electric Railway (Main Line) - Kobe-Sannomiya Station (Hanshin) 
*Hankyu Railway (Kobe Line, Kobe Kosoku Line) - Kobe-Sannomiya Station (Hankyu) 
*Kobe New Transit (Port Island Line, K01) - Sannomiya Station
*Kobe Municipal Subway (Seishin-Yamate Line, S03) - Sannomiya Station
*Kobe Municipal Subway (Kaigan Line, S03) - Sannomiya-Hanadokeimae Station (&quot;see separate article&quot;)
*JR West - Sannomiya Station (&quot;see separate article&quot;)
==Hanshin Railway Main Line==
=== Overview ===
The current station opened as Kobe Station on 12 April 1905. The station would undergo several name changes until the current name was introduced in 2013 along with the station number (HS 32).

In 1987, platform 3 was extended and a new ticket gate was opened on the north side.

The station was damaged by the Great Hanshin earthquake on 17 January 1995 and all services were suspended. Service was temporarily restored between this station and Kōsoku Kōbe on 1 February 1995, and full restoration of Hanshin Line services would be achieved on 26 June 1995.

===Layout===
This station has a combination bay/island platform serving three tracks below ground level. Tracks 1 and 3 are for through-trains running between Umeda and Sanyo-Himeji, while track 2 is for trains headed to Ōsaka Namba and Kintetsu Nara.


==Hankyu Railway Kobe Line, Kobe Kosoku Line==

=== Overview ===
Hankyu Railway’s station was established in 1936, and as its terminal within the city, was initially referred to as “Kobe”. 

The original station building was noted for its Art Deco architecture and a grand arch through which trains passed on their approach to the station; this was damaged beyond repair in the 1995 Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake and was replaced by a temporary structure, which remained in use until 2020. A new high-rise building is now under construction, mimicking the design of the original station building, but lacking the arch over the tracks.

===Layout===
This station has two island platforms with three tracks elevated close to JR Sannomiya Station.




==Kobe Municipal Subway Seishin-Yamate Line==
===Layout===
This station has a side platform serving a track on the second basement and the third basement.



===Gallery===
==Port Liner==
=== Overview ===
The platforms for the Port Island Line opened on 5 February 1981. Platform screen doors have been installed since opening day.

===Layout===
This station has an island platform serving two elevated tracks.

<text>The is a rapid transit system in Kobe, Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan. Like other large Japanese cities, Kobe&#x27;s subway system is heavily complemented by suburban rail. In addition, two people mover lines also serve the Kobe area: the Port Island Line and the Rokko Island Line.

==History==
Construction of the first line of the subway system, the Seishin Line, began on November 25, 1971. The line opened on March 13, 1977, running for between Myōdani and Shin-Nagata stations. A second line, the Yamate Line, opened on June 17, 1983, running for between Shin-Nagata and Ōkurayama stations. On June 18, 1985, the Yamate Line was extended to Shin-Kobe and the Seishin Line was extended to Gakuen-toshi. When the final stage of the Seishin Line, an extension to Seishin-Chuo, opened on March 18, 1987, the Seishin Line and the Yamate Line were merged into the Seishin-Yamate Line.

The Hokushin Kyūkō Electric Railway opened the Hokushin Line extension between Shin-Kobe and Tanigami on April 2, 1988; services on the Hokushin Line have through service onto the Seishin-Yamate Line.

On January 17, 1995, the Seishin-Yamate Line was damaged in the Great Hanshin earthquake. The day after the earthquake, limited services resumed between Seishin-Chuo and Itayado; full service was restored to the entire line in March 1995 after repairs were completed.

On July 7, 2001, the long Kaigan Line opened between Sannomiya-hanadokeimae and Shin-Nagata.

On June 1, 2020, Hokushin Line was transferred to Kobe Municipal Subway.

<doc id="227612" wikidata="Q1359937" url="?curid=227612" title="Neoism">
<text>Neoism is a parodistic -ism. It refers both to a specific subcultural network of artistic performance and media experimentalists, and, more generally, to a practical underground philosophy. It operates with collectively shared pseudonyms and identities, pranks, paradoxes, plagiarism and fakes, and has created multiple contradicting definitions of itself in order to defy categorization and historization.

==Background==

Definitions of Neoism were always disputed. The
main source of this is the undefinable concept of Neoism which created
vastly different, tactically distorted accounts of Neoism and its
history. Undisputed, however, are the origin of the movement in the late 1970s Canada. It was initiated by Hungarian-born Canadian performance and media-artist Istvan Kantor (aka Monty Cantsin) in 1979, in Montreal. At around the same time the open-pop-star identity of Monty Cantsin was spread through the Mail Artist David Zack
 (born New Orleans, June 12, 1938, died presumably in Texas ca. 1995) with the collaboration of artists Maris Kudzins and performance artist Istvan Kantor.

Schisms followed in the mid-1980s. Questions and concerns arose about whether the &quot;open pop star&quot; Monty Cantsin moniker was being overly associated with certain individuals. Later, writer Stewart Home sought to separate himself from the rest of the Neoist network, manifesting itself in Home&#x27;s books on Neoism as opposed to the various Neoist resources in the Internet. In non-Neoist terms, Neoism could be called an international subculture which in the beginning put itself into simultaneous continuity and discontinuity with, among others, experimental arts (such as Dada, Surrealism, Fluxus and Concept Art), punk, industrial music and electropop, political and religious free-spirit movements, science fiction literature, &#x27;pataphysics and speculative science. Neoism also gathered players with backgrounds in graffiti and street performance, language writing (later known as language poetry), experimental film and video, Mail Art, the early Church of the Subgenius and gay and lesbian culture. Neoism then gradually transformed from an active subculture into a self-written urban legend. As a side effect, many other subcultures, artistic and political groups since the late 1980s have—often vaguely—referred to or even opposed Neoism and thereby perpetuated its myth.

Since the gradual disappearance of Neoism in the 1990s, brief offshoots have appeared including The Seven By Nine Squares, Stewart Home&#x27;s frequent use of Karen Eliot (as well as Sandy Larson, Luther Blissett (nom de plume) and others) to replace Monty Cantsin as the embodiment of the open pop star concept. &quot;This project... confuses the restrictions that both define and delimit individual identity... Changing details, such as biographical particulars... are usually considered indispensable in securing the signature of an individual.&quot;

==History==

Neoism, as a name for a different context, was coined in 1914 by the American satirist Franklin P. Adams as a parody of modern arts. Sydney J. Bounds used the word as the name of a planet in his 1977 science fiction story &quot;No Way Back&quot;. In 1980 Monty spent two weeks at mail artist Ginny Lloyd&#x27;s San Francisco Storefront., a one year living art project holding art events and installations in a storefront window. He lived in the space, compiled writings and launched his Blood Campaign.

Neoism quickly spread to other places in America, Europe and Australia and involved up to two dozens of Neoists. Until the late 1980s and before the mass availability of the Internet, the mail art network continued to be used as the main communication and propaganda channel for Neoism.

Neoists refer to their strategies as &quot;the great confusion&quot; and &quot;radical play&quot;. They were acted out in semi-private Apartment Festivals which took place in North America, Europe and Australia between 1980 and 1998 and in publications which sought to embody confusion and radical play rather than just describing it. Consequently, both Neoist festivals and Neoist writing experimented with radical undermining of identity, bodies, media, and notions of ownership and truth. Unlike typical postmodern currents, the experiment was practical and therefore existential. Monty Cantsin, for example, was not simply a collective pseudonym or mythical person, but an identity lived by Neoists in their everyday life.

For these purposes, Neoists employed performance, video, small press publications (such as &quot;Smile&quot;, the international magazine of multiple origins) and computer viruses, but also food (Chapati), flaming steam irons and metal coat hangers (used as telepathic antennas). Borrowing from Thomas Pynchon, Neoism could be more suitably called an &quot;anarchist miracle&quot; of an international network of highly eccentric persons collaborating, often with extremist intensity, under the one shared identity of Monty Cantsin and Neoism.

In 2004 Neoism was cited by Javier Ruis in response to the National Assembly Against Racism&#x27;s condemnation of anarchists disrupting the Third European Social Forum session on anti- m and anti-racism in London (PGA Considered As Neoist Invisible Theatre).

In the early 1980s, the Neoist Reinhard U. Sevol founded Anti-Neoism, which other Neoists adopted by declaring
Neoism a pure fiction created by Anti-Neoists. The Dutch Neoist Arthur Berkoff operated as a one-person-movement 
&quot;Neoism/Anti-Neoism/Pregroperativism&quot;. Similarly, Blaster Al Ackerman declared himself a &quot;Salmineoist&quot; after Sicilian-American actor Sal Mineo, and John Berndt was credited by Ackerman as having given Neoism the name &quot;Spanish Art,&quot; circa 1983. In 1989, following the post-Neoist &quot;Festival of Plagiarism&quot; in Glasgow, Scotland, artist Mark Bloch left mail art and after publishing &quot;The Last Word&quot; remained defiantly silent on Neoism for almost two decades. In 1994, Stewart Home founded the Neoist Alliance as an occult order with himself as the magus. At the same time, Italian activists of the Luther Blissett project operated under the name &quot;Alleanza Neoista&quot;.

In 1997, the critic Oliver Marchart organized a &quot;Neoist World Congress&quot; in Vienna which did not involve any Neoists. In 2004 Istvan Kantor received the Governor General&#x27;s Award, and an international &quot;Neoist Department Festival&quot; took place in Berlin.

==Influences on other artists and subcultures==

With their design prank &quot;CONSUMER&#x27;S REST Lounge Chair&quot;, the &quot;one-man artist group&quot; &#x27; established a sub- as well as counter-culturally motivated connection between neoistically determined aspects of cultural consumption criticism and design consumption critical aspects of at the &quot;9th Neoist Festival&quot; in Ponte Nossa in 1985 and at the &quot;Festival of Plagiarism&quot; in Braunschweig&#x27;s University of Art in 1988. They also engaged in media consumption-critical public relations work in neoist collaborations and conspirations, especially with Neoism&#x27;s foremost &quot;therrorist&quot; &quot;tENTATIVELY, a cONVENIENCE&quot; (cit.: &quot;Neoism is a prefix and a suffix with no substance in between&quot;) on the aspect of &quot;Interpassivity&quot;, a neoist term coined by Stiletto. Since 1988 they had been consulted by &#x27; on a regular, from 1994 on predominatly interpassive basis as antineoist nutritionists. In 1995 &quot;Stiletto Studio,s&quot; presented &quot;LESS function IS MORE fun&quot; as a post-neoist special waste sale of design-defuncts in the &quot;Spätverkauf&quot; project store by Laura Kikauka at the Volksbühne Berlin.

Other artists who explicitly if vaguely credit Neoism are The KLF, Luther Blissett, Alexander Brener/Barbara Schurz, Lee Wells and Luke Haines (of The Auteurs and Black Box Recorder). The contemporary Dutch Artist Thomas Raat created a series of artworks based on Neoist manifestos and photographic documents.

<doc id="227618" wikidata="Q983380" url="?curid=227618" title="John Lennard-Jones">
<text>Sir John Edward Lennard-Jones (27 October 1894 – 1 November 1954) was a British mathematician and professor of theoretical physics at the University of Bristol, and then of theoretical science at the University of Cambridge. He was an important pioneer in the development of modern computational chemistry and theoretical chemistry.

==Early life and education==
Lennard-Jones was born John Edward Jones on 27 October 1894 at Leigh, Lancashire, the eldest son of Mary Ellen and Hugh Jones, an insurance agent. He was educated at Leigh Grammar School, going on to study at the University of Manchester, graduating in 1915 with a first-class honours degree in mathematics. Following service with the Royal Flying Corps during World War I, where he trained as a pilot, he studied for a Doctorate of Science (DSc) degree in Mathematics at Manchester, graduating in 1922. On the advice of Sydney Chapman, he then successfully applied for a Senior 1851 Exhibition at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was supervised by Ralph H. Fowler and graduated with a second doctorate in 1924.

==Career==
Lennard-Jones is well known among scientists for his work on molecular structure, valency and intermolecular forces. Much research of these topics over several decades grew from a paper he published in 1929. His theories of liquids and of surface catalysis also remain influential. He wrote few, albeit influential, papers.

His main interest was of atomic and molecular structure, especially the forces between atomic particles, the nature of chemical bonds and such basic matters as why water expands when it freezes. Holding the first Chair of Theoretical Chemistry in the United Kingdom (at the University of Cambridge), he established a research school applying to phenomena in physics and organic chemistry new concepts of quantum mechanics and the interactions of subatomic particles. The department attracted many notable scientists and mathematicians, including S.F. Boys, C.A. Coulson, G.G. Hall, A. Hurley, and J. Pople.

Atoms of a noble gas interact via a potential in which an attracting van der Waals force balances a repelling force which results from overlapping electron orbits. A well-known approximation to this potential is the so-called Lennard-Jones potential, a description of the potential energy as a function of the separation of the atoms. Also named after him, the Lennard-Jones Laboratory houses the School of Chemistry and Physics at Keele University. The Royal Society of Chemistry awards a Lennard-Jones Medal and hosts the Lennard-Jones lecture every second year.

Keele University holds a collection of Lennard-Jones&#x27;s published work, as well as a laboratory named in his honour. Professor C.A. Coulson&#x27;s collected lecture notes from 1928 to 1932, held in Cambridge University Library, record Lennard-Jones&#x27; lectures. Coulson wrote &#x27;I suspect that these are the first lectures on theoretical chemistry (or perhaps more accurately quantum chemistry) that had been given in Britain&#x27;. Lennard-Jones&#x27;s private papers are held at Churchill Archives Centre, in Cambridge.

On 26 August 1925 he married Kathleen Mary Lennard, and added her surname to his own to become Lennard-Jones. The couple had two children, John and Mary. He died of cancer at Stoke-on-Trent on 1 November 1954.

<doc id="227623" wikidata="Q235412" url="?curid=227623" title="Julie Clary">
<text>Marie Julie Clary (26 December 1771 – 7 April 1845), also known as Julie Bonaparte, was Queen of Naples, then of Spain and the Indies, as the wife of Joseph Bonaparte, who was King of Naples from January 1806 to June 1808, and later King of Spain and the Spanish West Indies from 25 June 1808 to June 1813.

==Early life==
Marie Julie Clary was born in Marseille, France, the daughter of François Clary (Marseille, St Ferreol, 24 February 1725 – Marseille, 20 January 1794), a wealthy silk manufacturer and merchant of Irish heritage, and his second wife (married on 26 June 1759) Françoise Rose Somis (Marseille, St. Ferreol, 30 August 1737 – Paris, 28 January 1815). 
Her sister Désirée Clary, six years younger, became Queen of Sweden and Norway when her husband, Marshal Bernadotte, was crowned King Charles XIV John of Sweden (Charles III John of Norway). Their brother, Nicolas Joseph Clary, was created 1st Comte Clary and married Anne Jeanne Rouyer (their granddaughter would be the first wife of Joachim, 4th Prince Murat). 

==Marriage==
On 1 August 1794, at Cuges (Bouches-du-Rhône department), she married Joseph Bonaparte, elder brother of Napoléon Bonaparte. She accompanied her spouse to Italy when he became ambassador to Rome in 1797, and then settled with him in Paris in 1804.

In 1804, when her brother-in-law Napoleon made himself emperor, he named his brother Joseph Imperial Prince, making Julie an Imperial Princess. During the coronation of the emperor and empress the same year, Julie was given the task of carrying the train of the empress with her sisters-in-law.

Although Julie was reportedly able to behave in accordance with court etiquette and &quot;royal formality&quot;, she preferred to live a private life surrounded by her family and relatives in her chateau in Mortefontaine, Oise (which had been bought in 1800), away from court as well as away from her adulterous spouse.

==Queen of Naples==

Joseph was made King of Naples in 1806, thereby making Julie queen consort of Naples. She preferred to stay separated from him in Mortefontaine, however, and was ceremoniously treated as queen in the Imperial court of Paris. 

She finally joined Joseph in Naples before April 1808, when she was sent there by Napoleon to support him, as he by that time faced a rebellion. 
When they left, the Napolitans were convinced that they had removed many valuables with them, and commented: 
:&quot;The King arrived like a sovereign, and left like a brigand. The Queen arrived in rags and left like a sovereign.&quot; 
==Queen of Spain==

In 1808, Joseph was made King of Spain and Julie thereby formally became Queen of Spain. She was the first queen of Spain not of royal birth. However, she did not join him when he traveled to Spain and in fact never lived there, preferring to remain in her residence in Mortefontaine. She was kept informed from Vichy and Plombières about her husband&#x27;s adulterous relationships in Spain. 

In France, she was regarded as the representative of Joseph and his kingdom and ceremoniously treated as the queen of Spain at the French Imperial court of Napoleon. She effectively functioned as an ambassador and informer of Joseph and upheld a political correspondence with him regarding Napoleon&#x27;s plans of Spain, warning Joseph that he should make precautions necessary to control Spain, its unity, finances and army himself, as Napoleon would never allow Spain to be too independent. In Spain, she was referred to as &quot;Reina ausente&quot; (&#x27;The Absent Queen&#x27;). 

==The fall of Napoleon==

Napoleon&#x27;s army was defeated at the Battle of Vitoria on 21 June 1813. During the war, Julie gave refuge to her sister Desirée Clary, who by her marriage to the Crown Prince of Sweden was in fact an enemy citizen, as well as her sister-in-law Catharina of Württemberg, in her home at Mortefontaine, and when the allied troops took Paris in 1814, Julie herself took refuge in the home of her sister Desirée in Paris. After the abdication of Napoleon in 1814, Julie bought the castle of Prangins in Switzerland, near Lake Léman.

During the Hundred Days in 1815, Julie was among those who welcomed Napoleon to the Palace in Paris; she dressed in an Imperial court robe, alongside his former stepdaughter Hortense.

After the Battle of Waterloo and the second downfall of Napoleon in 1815, the members of the Bonaparte family were exiled, and Joseph bought a property in New Jersey, near the Delaware River, with the proceeds of the sale of Spanish paintings taken from ransacked Madrid palaces, castles, monasteries and town halls; Julie herself, however, did not join him there, but left with her daughters to Frankfurt, where she stayed for six years, separated from her French-American husband.

In 1816, her sister Desiree, who was Crown Princess of Sweden, wished to bring Julie with her upon her return to Sweden; her husband the crown prince, however, thought this unwise, as Julie was a member of the Bonaparte family and her presence might be taken as a sign that he sided with the deposed Napoleon, and in the end, this came to nothing.

==Later life==
Julie settled in Brussels in 1821, and then in Florence, Italy, at the Palazzo Serristori. She did not socialize with the French people. She was described as charming, quiet, dignified and peaceful and generally well liked. In 1823, she parted with her sister Desiree, who became queen of Sweden.

In 1840, Joseph joined Julie in Florence. In spite of his adultery, she referred to Joseph as &quot;my beloved husband&quot;. 
Joseph Bonaparte died on 28 July 1844, aged 76. Julie died eight months later in Florence, on 7 April 1845, at the age of seventy-three. She was buried next to Joseph at the Basilica of Santa Croce in Florence. In 1862, the self-proclaimed French Emperor Napoleon III brought Joseph Bonaparte&#x27;s remains back to France and had them inhumed to the right of his younger brother, the Emperor Napoleon I. The remains of Julie are still at the Basilica of Santa Croce in Florence beside those of her daughter, Charlotte, who died in Lucca, in Italy, on 3 March 1839, aged 36, giving birth to a stillborn child.

==Children==

Joseph and Julie Bonaparte had three daughters: 
* Julie Joséphine Bonaparte (Genoa, 29 February 1796 – Genoa, 6 June 1797).
* Zénaïde Laetitia Julie Bonaparte (Paris, 8 July 1801 – Naples, 8 August 1854); married in Brussels on 29 June 1822 to Charles Lucien Bonaparte, 2nd Prince of Canino and Musignano (Paris, 24 May 1803 - Paris, 29 July 1857).
* Charlotte Napoléone Bonaparte (Paris, 31 October 1802 – Sarzana, 2 March 1839); married in Brussels on 23 July 1826 to Napoléon Louis Bonaparte (Paris, 11 October 1804 - Rome, 17 March 1831), formerly King of Holland and Grand-Duke of Berg, without issue.

<doc id="227627" wikidata="Q1331905" url="?curid=227627" title="Lewy body dementia">
<text>Lewy body dementia (LBD) is an umbrella term for two similar and common subtypes of dementia: dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and
Parkinson&#x27;s disease dementia (PDD). Both are characterized by changes in thinking, movement, behavior, and mood. The two conditions have similar features and may have similar causes, and are believed to belong on a spectrum of Lewy body disease that includes Parkinson&#x27;s disease. As of 2014, they were more often misdiagnosed than any other common dementia.

The exact cause is unknown, but involves widespread deposits of abnormal clumps of protein that form in neurons of the diseased brain. Known as Lewy bodies (discovered in 1912 by Frederic Lewy) and Lewy neurites, these clumps affect both the central nervous system and the autonomic nervous system. The fifth revision of the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (DSM-5) gives Lewy body disease as the causative subtype of dementia with Lewy bodies, and Parkinson&#x27;s disease as the causative subtype of Parkinson&#x27;s disease dementia. Dementia with Lewy bodies is marked by the presence of Lewy bodies primarily in the cortical regions, and Parkinson&#x27;s disease dementia with Lewy bodies primarily in the subcortical basal ganglia.

==Classification==

The synucleinopathies (dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson&#x27;s disease dementia, and Parkinson&#x27;s disease) are characterized by shared features of parkinsonism motor symptoms, neuropsychiatric symptoms, impaired cognition, sleep disorders, and visual hallucinations. The Lewy body dementias—dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and Parkinson&#x27;s disease dementia (PDD)—are distinguished by the timing when cognitive and motor symptoms appear. The two Lewy body dementias are often considered to belong on a spectrum of Lewy body disease that includes Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

MeSH lists Lewy body disease in several categories: as a nervous system disease in two listings, one as a basal ganglia Parkinsonian movement disorder and the other under brain disease as a dementia; as a neurodegenerative disorder listed as a synucleinopathy; and as a neurocognitive disorder listed with dementia.

A genetic architecture that predisposes an individual to some disease phenotypes is found in Parkinson&#x27;s disease and the Lewy body dementias. The presence of Lewy bodies is a link between these disorders; the term &#x27;diseases with Lewy bodies&#x27; therefore may be more accurate than &#x27;Lewy body disease&#x27;.

==Cause and mechanisms==
Dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson&#x27;s disease dementia are similar in many ways, suggesting there may be a common pathophysiological mechanism, with PDD and DLB at opposite ends of a Lewy body disease spectrum, and a shared component of protein deposits in Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. Lewy bodies and neurites have been found to develop from the aggregation of misfolded alpha-synuclein, a protein thought to assist in neurotransmitter release and vesicle turnover; whether these misfolded proteins are responsible for the neurodegenerative effects remains unclear, and no definitive link between Lewy bodies and neurodegenerative effects has been found. DSM-5 gives Lewy body disease as the causative subtype of DLB, and Parkinson&#x27;s disease as the causative subtype of PDD. DLB is marked by the presence of Lewy bodies primarily in the cortical regions, and PDD with Lewy bodies primarily in the subcortical basal ganglia.

Despite differences in the timing of the appearance of symptoms, the two dementias &quot;show remarkably convergent neuropathological changes at autopsy&quot;. The relationship between Parkinson&#x27;s disease dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies is unclear as of 2020, but there is likely to be genetic overlap, and the two conditions may represent different points on a continuum.

== Diagnosis ==

Dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson&#x27;s disease dementia have similar neuropathological features, but these features are highly variable and the conditions cannot be distinguished on pathological features alone. Generally, dementia with Lewy bodies is distinguished from Parkinson&#x27;s disease dementia by the time frame in which dementia symptoms appear relative to parkinsonian symptoms and is diagnosed when cognitive symptoms begin before or at the same time as parkinsonism. Parkinson&#x27;s disease dementia is the diagnosis when Parkinson&#x27;s disease is already well established before the dementia occurs.

==Epidemiology==

Between 5% and 25% of diagnosed dementias in older adults are due to one of the Lewy body dementias. As of 2014, the Lewy body dementias affect about 1.3 million people in the US and 140,000 in the UK.

LBD usually develops after the age of 50. Men are more likely to be diagnosed than women.

==Prognosis==

Life expectancy of people with one of the LBD is reduced; following diagnosis it ranges on average from five to eight years.

==Society and culture==
===Advocacy and awareness===
As of 2014, the Lewy body dementias were more often misdiagnosed than any other common dementia. Most people with DLB had not heard of the condition prior to diagnosis; general awareness about LBD lags well behind that of Parkinson&#x27;s and Alzheimer&#x27;s diseases, even though LBD is the second most common dementia, after Alzheimer&#x27;s. It is not only frustrating for families and caregivers to find that few people, including many healthcare professionals, are knowledgeable about LBD; lack of knowledge can have significant health consequences because people with LBD have severe sensitivity to antipsychotics often used to treat the symptoms. The Lewy Body Dementia Association (LBDA) and the UK Lewy Body Society promote awareness and provide support that helps society, by reducing costly use of healthcare, and families with LBD, by reducing stress. These organizations, and others in Argentina, Australia and Japan, help raise knowledge and help families with LBD become advocates to raise awareness about the disease.

===Notable individuals===

Robin Williams, the American actor and comedian, died on August 11, 2014. Before his suicide, he had been diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and according to his widow, Susan Schneider Williams, he experienced depression, anxiety, and increasing paranoia. Upon autopsy, his widow said he was found to have diffuse Lewy body disease, while the autopsy used the term &quot;diffuse Lewy body dementia&quot;. The vocabulary associated with Lewy pathology causes confusion. &quot;Lewy body dementia&quot; (the umbrella term that encompasses the clinical diagnoses of dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson&#x27;s disease dementia) differs from &quot;Lewy body disease&quot; (the term used to describe pathological findings of Lewy bodies on autopsy). Dennis Dickson, a spokesperson for the Lewy Body Dementia Association, clarified the distinction by stating that &quot;diffuse Lewy body dementia&quot; is more commonly called &quot;diffuse Lewy body disease&quot; and refers to the underlying disease process. According to Dickson, &quot;Lewy bodies are generally limited in distribution&quot; in early Parkinson&#x27;s disease, while in dementia with Lewy bodies, &quot;the Lewy bodies are spread widely throughout the brain, as was the case with Robin Williams.&quot; Ian G. McKeith, professor and researcher of Lewy body dementias, commented that Williams&#x27; symptoms and autopsy findings were explained by dementia with Lewy bodies.

The British author and poet Mervyn Peake died in 1968 and was diagnosed posthumously as a probable case of DLB in a 2003 paper published in &quot;JAMA Neurology&quot;. Sahlas said his death was &quot;variously ascribed to Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, or postencephalitic parkinsonism&quot;. Based on signs in his work and letters of progressive deterioration, fluctuating cognitive decline, deterioration in visuospatial function, declining attention span, and visual hallucinations and delusions, his may be the earliest known case where DLB was found to have been the likely cause of death.

Other entertainers and artists who have or died from LBD include Estelle Getty, the actress known for her role as Sophia on the television series &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, Nicholas King, a US actor and horticulturist, actress Dina Merrill, Donald Featherstone, who created the plastic pink flamingo, American radio and television host Casey Kasem, Canadian singer Pierre Lalonde, graphic artist/film set designer Ron Cobb, American actor Frank Bonner, and Canadian musician and actor André Gagnon.

Individuals from industry or government who have or died from LBD include Seymour Berry, US Director of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; publisher Otis Chandler, Philip J. Rock,
a US Democratic politician of the Illinois Senate, U.S. media mogul and philanthropist Ted Turner, and Indian-born British billionaire S. P. Hinduja.

Arnold R. Hirsch, an American historian who taught at the University of New Orleans, and Jessie Isabelle Price, an American veterinary microbiologist, died from LBD.

In the sports realm, Jerry Sloan, American professional basketball player and coach, died from LBD. Major League Baseball players Tom Seaver, Andy Carey, and Bill Buckner died of LBD. Stan Mikita, Canadian ice hockey player, was diagnosed with possible LBD, but a post-mortem brain autopsy found that he had chronic traumatic encephalopathy.

===In popular culture===
&quot;Robin&#x27;s Wish&quot;, a documentary exploring Robin Williams&#x27;s Lewy body disease and how it contributed to his death, was released in September 2020.

&quot;Sleepwalk with Me&quot; is a book, one-man comedy, and film about a young man with relationship problems and RBD, a precursor to synucleinopathy, including LBD.

<text>Pickpocketing is a form of larceny that involves the stealing of money or other valuables from the person or a victim&#x27;s pocket without them noticing the theft at the time. It may involve considerable dexterity and a knack for misdirection. A thief who works in this manner is known as a pickpocket.

==As an occupation==

Pickpockets and other thieves, especially those working in teams, sometimes apply distraction, such as asking a question or bumping into the victim. These distractions sometimes require sleight of hand, speed, misdirection and other types of skills.

Pickpockets may be found in any crowded place around the world. However, Barcelona and Rome have been noted as being particularly dangerous pickpocket havens. Thieves have been known to operate in high traffic areas such as mass transit stations, even boarding subway trains so they can use the distractions of crowds and sudden stop-and-go movements from the train to steal from others. As soon as the thieves have what they want, they simply get off at the next stop leaving the victim unable to figure out who robbed them and when.

==As entertainment==
Pickpocketing skills are employed by some magicians as a form of entertainment, either by taking an item from a spectator or by returning it without them knowing they had lost it. , arguably the most famous stage pickpocket of all time, became the highest-paid European performer in circuses during the 1950s. For 60 years he was billed as &quot;the King of Pickpockets&quot; and encouraged his son, Charly, to follow in his cunning trade, his offspring being billed as &quot;the Prince of Pickpockets&quot;. Henri Kassagi, a French-Tunisian illusionist, acted as technical advisor on Robert Bresson&#x27;s 1959 film &quot;Pickpocket&quot; and appeared as instructor and accomplice to the main character. British entertainer James Freedman created the pickpocket sequences for the 2005 film &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; directed by Roman Polanski. American illusionist David Avadon featured pickpocketing as his trademark act for more than 30 years and promoted himself as &quot;a daring pickpocket with dashing finesse&quot; and &quot;the country&#x27;s premier exhibition pickpocket, one of the few masters in the world of this underground art.&quot; According to Thomas Blacke, an American illusionist who holds several world records, it has become more difficult nowadays to pickpocket both in the streets and on the stage because the general population wears less, or lighter, clothing. In 2015 an artist hired a pickpocket to distribute sculptures at Frieze Art Fair in New York.

== Methods ==

Pickpocketing often requires different levels of skill, relying on a mixture of sleight of hand and misdirection. To get the proper misdirect or distraction, pickpockets will normally use the distracting environment that crowds offer or create situations using accomplices. Pickpocketing still thrives in Europe and other countries that are high in tourism. It&#x27;s most common in areas with large crowds. Sometimes pickpockets put signs up that warn tourists to watch for pickpockets. This causes people to worry and quickly check if their valuables are still on them, thereby showing pickpockets exactly where their valuables are. Once a pickpocket finds a person they want to steal from, often called a &quot;mark&quot; or a victim, the pickpocket will then create or look for an opportunity to steal.

The most common methods used by modern-day pickpockets are:

* Driving by and snatching a passerby&#x27;s items. This method is common in cities like London where mopeds are a common way to travel.
* Offering to help someone with their luggage, then proceeding to disappear in a crowded area. This method works well because it gives the victim a false sense of trust with the pickpocketer.
* The next technique involves a team of three or more people and a crowded area. After finding their mark, two of the pickpockets slow down while walking in front of their mark appearing as a lost couple. Meanwhile, the mark is stuck behind them and their accomplice goes through the mark&#x27;s bag unnoticed.
* Using large crowds where there is a small doorway, like that in trains, forcing the crowd to squeeze together to get through. A pickpocket uses this opportunity to stick their hands into peoples&#x27; pockets and go unnoticed.
* Using a stooge, a fake couple, or group goes up and ask the mark for help. For example, it can be to take their photo, hold their bag, or just simply asking for directions and getting them to hold a map. As this is happening their partner is going through the mark&#x27;s bags while they are distracted helping.
* Using a child to pickpocket or as a distraction is common in many countries.
* The bump is the most famous of all the ways and is often used in movies. It is where the pickpocket bumps into the mark inconspicuously, allowing them to access the mark&#x27;s pockets. The bump usually requires expert sleight of hand.
* Another common technique is so-called the &quot;slash and grab&quot;; the pickpocket cuts a purse or bag strap without the mark&#x27;s knowledge and makes off with the bag. They can then take the contents and leave behind the bag and any form of identification in the trash or a back alley.

==Famous pickpockets==
Famous fictional pickpockets include the Artful Dodger and Fagin, characters from the Charles Dickens&#x27; 1838 novel &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;. Famous true-life historical pickpockets include the Irish prostitute Chicago May, who was profiled in books; Mary Frith, nicknamed Moll Cutpurse; the Gubbins band of highwaymen; and Cutting Ball, a notorious Elizabethan thief. George Barrington&#x27;s escapades, arrests, and trials, were widely chronicled in the late 18th-century London press.

== Pickpocketing in the 17th and 18th centuries ==
The 17th and 18th centuries saw a significant number of men and women pickpockets, operating in public and/or private places and stealing different types of items. Some of those pickpockets were caught and prosecuted for their theft, however, in most cases, they managed to avoid punishment (whether they were skilful enough not to get caught or they were acquitted in court). 

In the 17th century, pickpockets were sometimes referred to as &quot;cut-purses&quot;, as can be seen in some 17th century ballads. At that time, pockets were not yet sewn to clothes, as they are today. This means that the pockets were a small purse that people wore close to their body. This was especially true for women, since men&#x27;s pockets were sewn &quot;into the linings of their coats&quot;. Women&#x27;s pockets were worn beneath a piece of clothing, and not &quot;as opposed to pouches or bags hanging outside their clothes&quot;. These external pockets were still in fashion until the mid-19th century.

=== Gender ===
Pickpocketing in the 18th century was committed by both men and women (looking at prosecuted cases of pickpocketing, it appears that there were more female defendants than male.) Along with shoplifting, pickpocketing was the only type of crime committed by more women than men. It seems that in the 18th century, most pickpockets stole out of economic needs: they were often poor and did not have any economic support, and unemployment was &quot;the single most important cause of poverty&quot;, leading the most needy ones to pick pockets.

In most cases, pickpockets operated depending on the opportunities they got: if they saw someone wearing a silver watch or with a handkerchief bulging out of their pocket, the pickpockets took the item. This means that the theft was, in such cases, not premeditated. However, some pickpockets did work as a gang, in which cases they planned thefts, even though they could not be sure of what they would get (Defoe&#x27;s &quot;Moll Flanders&quot; gives several examples of how pickpockets worked as a team or on their own, when the eponymous character becomes a thief out of need).

The prosecutions against pickpockets at the Old Bailey between 1780 and 1808 show that male pickpockets were somewhat younger than female ones: 72% of men pickpockets convicted at the time were aged from under 20 to 30, while 72% of women convicted of picking pockets were aged between 20 and 40. One reason that may explain why women pickpockets were older is that most of women pickpockets were prostitutes (this explains why very few women under 20 years old were convicted for picking pockets). At the end of the 18th century, 76% of women defendants were prostitutes, and as a result, the victims of pickpockets were more often men than women.

In most cases, these prostitutes would lay with men (who were frequently drunk), and take advantage of the situation to steal from these clients. Men who were robbed by prostitutes often chose not to prosecute the pickpockets, since they would have had to acknowledge their &quot;immoral behaviour&quot;. The few men who decided to prosecute prostitutes for picking their pockets were often mocked in Court, and very few prostitutes ended up being declared fully guilty.

The men who were prosecuted for picking pockets and who were under 20 years old were often children working in gangs, under the authority of an adult who trained them to steal. The children involved in these gangs were orphans (either because of having been abandoned or because their parents had died), and the whole relationship they had with the adult ruling the gang and the other children was that of a &quot;surrogate family&quot;. Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; provides a good example of how orphans were recruited and turned into street criminals.

Male and female pickpockets tended to operate in different locations: 80% of men operated in public areas while 78% of women operated in private places. This can be explained by the fact that most female pickpockets were prostitutes, robbing their victims in their lodging after having lain with them. Male pickpockets, on the other hand, tended to operate in public places because they did not have the opportunity that prostitutes had.

The fact that men and women did not operate in the same places led to them stealing different types of items: men stole mostly handkerchiefs, because they were one of the easiest items to take from someone without them noticing it. Women tended to steal watches (some pickpockets also stole watches in public places, but it was more difficult) and bags with money in them. When defending themselves in court, prostitutes often argued that the money had been a gift from the victim and managed to be acquitted, as the men prosecuting them were often drunk at the time of the theft and were not taken seriously by the court.

=== Prosecution ===
In the eyes of British law, pickpocketing was considered a capital offence from 1565 on: this meant that it was punishable by hanging. However, for the crime to be considered as a capital offence, the stolen item had to be worth more than 12 pennies, otherwise it was considered to be petty larceny, which meant that the thief would not be hanged. The 18th century law also stated that only the thief could be prosecuted—any accomplice or receiver of the stolen item could not be found guilty of the crime: &quot;This meant that, if two people were indicted together, and there was not clear proof as to which one made the final act of taking, neither should be found guilty&quot;.

Moreover, in order to be able to prosecute someone for pickpocketing, the victim of the theft had to not be aware that they were being robbed. In 1782, a case at the Old Bailey made it clear that this was supposed to prevent people who had been robbed while they were drunk from prosecuting the defendant (in most of the cases that meant men who had been robbed by prostitutes): The victims of pickpockets who were drunk at the time of the theft were considered to be partially responsible for being robbed.

Even though pickpockets were supposed to be hanged for their crime, this punishment, in fact, rarely happened: 61% of women accused of picking pockets were acquitted and those who were not acquitted often managed to escape the capital sentence, as only 6% of defendants accused of pickpocketing between 1780 and 1808 were hanged.

In the cases of prostitutes being accused of having pickpocketed male prosecutors, the jury&#x27;s verdict was very often more favourable to the woman defendant than to the man prosecuting her. Men who had been laying with prostitutes were frowned upon by the court. One of the reasons was that they had chosen to take off their clothes, they were also drunk most of the time, so they were considered responsible for being robbed. The other reason is that it was considered bad for a man to mix with a prostitute, which is why in many cases there was no prosecution: the victim was too ashamed of admitting that he had been with a prostitute.

In those cases, since the jury was often inclined to despise the prosecutor and to side with the defendant, when they did not completely acquit the woman they often reached a partial verdict and this mostly meant transportation to America (that is the case for &quot;Moll Flanders&quot;), and to Australia later on.

<text>The world economy or global economy is the economy of all humans in the world, referring to the global economic system, which includes all economic activities conducted both within and between nations, including production, consumption, economic management, work in general, financial transactions and trade of goods and services. In some contexts, the two terms are distinct: the &quot;international&quot; or &quot;global economy&quot; is measured separately and distinguished from national economies, while the &quot;world economy&quot; is simply an aggregate of the separate countries&#x27; measurements. Beyond the minimum standard concerning value in production, use and exchange, the definitions, representations, models and valuations of the world economy vary widely. It is inseparable from the geography and ecology of planet Earth.
It is common to limit questions of the world economy exclusively to human economic activity, and the world economy is typically judged in monetary terms, even in cases in which there is no efficient market to help valuate certain goods or services, or in cases in which a lack of independent research, genuine data or government cooperation makes calculating figures difficult. Typical examples are illegal drugs and other black market goods, which by any standard are a part of the world economy, but for which there is, by definition, no legal market of any kind.
However, even in cases in which there is a clear and efficient market to establish monetary value, economists do not typically use the current or official exchange rate to translate the monetary units of this market into a single unit for the world economy since exchange rates typically do not closely reflect worldwide value – for example, in cases where the volume or price of transactions is closely regulated by the government.

Rather, market valuations in a local currency are typically translated to a single monetary unit using the idea of purchasing power. This is the method used below, which is used for estimating worldwide economic activity in terms of real United States dollars or euros. However, the world economy can be evaluated and expressed in many more ways. It is unclear, for example, how many of the world&#x27;s 7.8 billion people () have most of their economic activity reflected in these valuations.
Until the middle of the 19th century, global output was dominated by China and India, with the Indian subcontinent being the world&#x27;s largest economy from 1 C.E to 17 C.E. Waves of the Industrial Revolution in Western Europe and Northern America shifted the shares to the Western Hemisphere. As of 2024, the following 20 countries or collectives have reached an economy of at least US$2 trillion by Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in nominal or Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) terms: [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[China]], [[Egypt]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Mexico]], [[South Korea]], [[Russia]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Spain]], [[Turkey]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], the [[European Union]] and the [[African Union]].

Despite high levels of government investment, the global economy decreased by 3.4% in 2020 in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, an improvement from the World Bank&#x27;s initial prediction of a 5.2 percent decrease. Cities account for 80% of global GDP, thus they faced the brunt of this decline. The world economy increased again in 2021 with an estimated 5.5 percent rebound.

The FTSE Global Equity Index Series is a series of stock market indices and provides coverage of stocks in 48 countries, covering 98% of the world&#x27;s investable market capitalization.

==Statistical indicators==
===Finance===

* GDP (GWP) (gross world product): (purchasing power parity exchange rates) – $59.38 trillion (2005 est.), $51.48 trillion (2004), $23 trillion (2002). The GWP is the combined gross national income of all the countries in the world. When calculating the GWP, add GDP of all countries. Also, GWP shows that imports and exports are equal. Because imports and exports balance exactly when considering the whole world:, this also equals the total global gross domestic product (GDP). According to the World Bank, the 2013 nominal GWP was approximately US$75.59 trillion. In 2017, according to the CIA&#x27;s World Factbook, the GWP was around US$80.27 trillion in nominal terms and totaled approximately 127.8 trillion international dollars in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP). The per capita PPP GWP in 2017 was approximately Int$17,500 according to the World Factbook.
* GDP (GWP) (gross world product): (market exchange rates) – $60.69 trillion (2008). The market exchange rates increased from 1990 to 2008. The reason for this increase is the world&#x27;s advancement in terms of technology.
* GDP (real growth rate): The following part shows the GDP growth rate and the expected value after one year.
** Developed Economies. A developed country, industrialized country, more developed country (MDC), or more economically developed country (MEDC), is a sovereign state that has a developed economy and advanced technological infrastructure relative to other less industrialized nations. Most commonly, the criteria for evaluating the degree of economic development are gross domestic product (GDP), gross national product (GNP), the per capita income, level of industrialization, amount of widespread infrastructure and general standard of living. Which criteria are to be used and which countries can be classified as being developed are subjects of debate. The GDP of the developed countries is predicted to fall from 2.2% in 2017 to 2.0% in 2018 due to the fall in dollar value.
** Developing Countries. A developing country is a country with a less developed industrial base (industries) and a low Human Development Index (HDI) relative to other countries. However, this definition is not universally agreed upon. There is also no clear agreement on which countries fit this category. A nation&#x27;s GDP per capita, compared with other nations, can also be a reference point. In general, the United Nations accepts any country&#x27;s claim of itself being &quot;developing&quot;. The GDP of the developing countries is expected to rise from 4.3% in 2017 to 4.6% in 2018 due to political stability in those countries and advancement in technology.
** Least developed countries. The least developed countries (LDCs) is a list of developing countries that, according to the United Nations, exhibit the lowest indicators of socioeconomic development, with the lowest Human Development Index ratings of all countries in the world. The concept of LDCs originated in the late 1960s and the first group of LDCs was listed by the UN in its resolution 2768 (XXVI) of 18 November 1971. This is a group of countries that are expected to improve their GDP from 4.8% in 2017 to 5.4% in 2018. The predicted growth is associated advancement in technology and industrialization of those countries for the past decade.
* GDP – per capita: purchasing power parity – $9,300, €7,500 (2005 est.), $8,200, €6,800 (92) (2003), $7,900, €5,000 (2002)
* World median income: purchasing power parity $1,041, €950 (1993)
* GDP – composition by sector: agriculture: 4%; industry: 32%; services: 64% (2004 est.)
* Inflation rate (consumer prices); In economics, inflation is a general rise in the price level in an economy over a period of time, resulting in a sustained drop in the purchasing power of money. When the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; consequently, inflation reflects a reduction in the purchasing power per unit of money – a loss of real value in the medium of exchange and unit of account within the economy. The opposite of inflation is deflation, a sustained decrease in the general price level of goods and services. The common measure of inflation is the inflation rate, the annualized percentage change in a general price index, usually the consumer price index, over time. &quot;national inflation rates vary widely in individual cases, from declining prices in Japan to hyperinflation (In economics, hyperinflation is very high and typically accelerating inflation) in several Third World countries (2003)&quot;: 
** World 2.6% (2017), 2.8% (predicted 2018);

From the scientific perspective, economic activities are embedded in a web of dynamic, interrelated, and interdependent activities that constitute the natural system of Earth. Novel application of cybernetics in decision-making (such as in decision-making related to process- and product-design and related laws) and direction of human activity (such as economic activity) may make it easier to control modern ecological problems.

== Historical development ==

Per the MSCI All Country World Index, the breakdown of market sector is as follows:

One example for a comparable metric other than GDP are the OECD Better Life Index rankings for different aggregative domains.

The index includes 11 comparable &quot;dimensions&quot; of well-being:
#Housing: housing conditions and spendings (e.g. real estate pricing)
#Income: household income (after taxes and transfers) and net financial wealth
#Jobs: earnings, job security and unemployment
#Community: quality of social support network
#Education: education and what one gets out of it
#Environment: quality of environment (e.g. environmental health)
#Governance: involvement in democracy
#Health
#Life Satisfaction: level of happiness
#Safety: murder and assault rates
#Work-life balance

== Economic studies ==
To promote exports, many government agencies publish on the web economic studies by sector and country. Among these agencies include the USCS (US DoC) and FAS (USDA) in the United States, the EDC and AAFC in Canada, Ubifrance in France, the UKTI in the United Kingdom, the HKTDC and JETRO in Asia, Austrade and the NZTE in Oceania. Through Partnership Agreements, the Federation of International Trade Associations publishes studies from several of these agencies (USCS, FAS, AAFC, UKTI, and HKTDC) as well as other non-governmental organizations on its website globaltrade.net.

<doc id="227634" wikidata="Q1489155" url="?curid=227634" title="Gabriel Dumont (Métis leader)">
<text>Gabriel Dumont (1837–1906) was a Métis political figure best known for being a prominent leader of the Métis people. Dumont was well known for his movements within the North-West Rebellion  at the battles of Batoche, Fish Creek, and Duck Lake as well as for his role in the signing of treaties with the Blackfoot tribe, the traditional main enemy of the Métis.

Dumont was born to Isidore Dumont and Louise Laframboise in 1837 in Red River. Growing up Dumont had little in the way of education – he was illiterate but could speak seven languages. In the early stages of his life, Dumont relied on buffalo hunting in order to gain a source of food. His family made a living through hunting buffalo and trading with the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. After his time leading the Métis people alongside Louis Riel, Dumont spent time travelling throughout the United States where he spoke at public speaking events and political campaigns. In 1889 he dictated his memoirs in Quebec.

Dumont was known throughout the Métis community for his various political and military endeavours. Among his major political campaigns was the severing of a treaty between the Métis and the Dakota in 1882. Just one year later, Dumont was elected hunt chief of the Saskatchewan Métis. Dumont was known as the adjutant general of the Métis people – he played a large role in the well-being of the Métis community and their subsequent rebellion against the Canadian government during the North-West Rebellion. Dumont also figured prominently in the Battle of Duck Lake, as well as the battles of Fish Creek and Batoche.

Dumont&#x27;s legacy is marked by his grave in Batoche, as well as through his mark on the Métis people. Gabriel Bridge, a bridge that spans the Saskatchewan River, is named after Dumont, as are several research institutions and schools. In addition, many books and poems have been written about Dumont&#x27;s life, his works, and his legacy as a political figure.

==Early life==
Gabriel Dumont was born in December 1837 in what is now known as Winnipeg as the fourth child and eldest son of 11 children.

His parents were Isidore Dumont (known commonly as Ekapow) and Louise Laframboise, who made their home in the Red River Colony. Gabriel was the grandson of the French-Canadian voyageur Jean-Baptiste Dumont and his First-Nations wife Josette of the Tsuu T’ina-Crow tribe. Dumont was not educated in a traditional European education system, rather he learned important skills during his childhood travelling across the Canadian Prairies (Great Plains) following the bison and learning the skills to become a hunter.

The Dumont family was known throughout the settlement of Red River as a prominent Métis buffalo hunting family. In addition to this distinction, they held a long-vaunted relationship with the Saskatchewan area as leaders of a brigade. The Dumont family made their fortune through hunting in the lands controlled by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, with the primary source of their income coming through the trade of pemmican with the company. Dumont was introduced to the art of Métis buffalo hunting in his childhood years, and over time mastered the nuances of prairie life. This would equip him in the years to come for the conflict he would endure.

Madeleine Wilkie – the daughter of Jean Baptiste Wilkie and his Métis wife Amable Elise Azure – married Dumont in 1858. Throughout his travels as a hunter, Dumont traded with different tribes and picked up different languages making him more valuable to his tribe. In 1868, Dumont and his wife settled in the Batoche area permanently.

Dumont was known for his incredible versatility both as a huntsman and as a convenor of multilingualism. It was purported that Dumont could converse with an individual in no less than seven separate languages (although it was noted that Dumont never learned more than a few small phrases in English). His skills as a huntsman and marksman were another finely honed trait, in both the disciplines of bow and rifle. In addition to these traits, Dumont was known as a proficient horseman. In much the same vein as many of the other prominent Métis leaders of his day such as Louis Riel, Dumont had mastered the fine art of diplomacy in the northern plains of the West.

==Military actions and conflicts==
Dumont was first introduced to plains warfare at the young age of 13 in 1851, where he fought in the Battle of Grand Coteau against the much larger contingent of Yankton Sioux. Dumont&#x27;s actions in that conflict included defending a large Métis encampment against the advances of a Dakota war party.

In 1862, at the age of 24, Dumont served as the intermediary between the Métis and the Dakota whilst being accompanied by his father Isadore Dumont and uncle Jean Baptise Dumont. Later on, Dumont helped to sign a treaty with the Blackfoot, an action that led to a long state of peace with the traditional enemies of the Métis.

Although he was considered one of the figureheads of the Métis movement at the time, Dumont was not involved in the Red River Rebellion that took place from 1869 to 1870. However, Dumont did move quickly to Fort Garry in order to offer his military assistance during Colonel Garnet Wolseley&#x27;s movement on the area.

Around the time of 1885, the North-West Rebellion broke out. Dumont&#x27;s army of 300 Métis soldiers organized near Duck Lake on 26 March, and conflict broke out between the ranks of the Métis and the North-West Mounted Police later that day. Among the dead on the Métis side was Dumont&#x27;s brother, Isidore – the victim of a botched parley attempt. Dumont was dealt a glancing blow to his head from a stray bullet during the battle, cutting an artery, and was thereafter confined to nursing his injury while the rest of the North-West Rebellion played out. However, this injury suffered during the Duck Lake confrontation did not prevent Dumont from leading his soldiers.

Dumont also played a key role in discovering the traitors within the Saskatchewan Métis. In particular, Dumont was a part of the arrest of Albert Monkman. Dumont ensured the safety of Louis Riel by jumping in front of Monkman&#x27;s revolver when he pulled it on Riel, leading to Monkman&#x27;s quick arrest. Dumont was acutely aware that more Canadian troops led by General Frederick Middleton were streaming towards their location. In order to combat the advancing threat, Dumont proposed a campaign of terror that focused on uprooting railroads and prolonged periods of violence against Canadian soldiers. Riel was more inclined towards a peaceful resolution to proceedings, and Dumont deferred to Riel&#x27;s judgements.

Dumont&#x27;s contingent of 300 Métis soldiers clashed with the opposing Canadian soldiers on 24 April at a place dubbed Fish Creek by the Canadians. The efforts of the Métis soldiers caused General Middleton to pause in his advancement towards Batoche. With the battle only lasting one day, the Métis soldiers were outnumbered five to one. Dumont&#x27;s skillful military leadership allowed them to drive off the attackers and enabled the Métis soldiers to eventually retreat to the relative safety of Batoche. Once the Canadian soldiers reached Batoche, Dumont led a defence of the Métis community that lasted four days. After the first day there was no clear winner amongst the two sides, despite the Métis being once again vastly outnumbered. Although they lacked the numbers to truly put a dent in the Canadian forces, Dumont&#x27;s group handicapped a military steamer and managed to repel several of Middleton&#x27;s infantry pushes. The Métis utilized the tactic of digging holes approximately every to allow for the Métis troops to hide and advance throughout a vast majority of land, allowing for a place to watch the Canadians and easily attack. By the fourth day of the defence, the Métis soldiers were out of ammunition and shooting nails and pieces of metal. That day, the Canadian soldiers broke through Dumont&#x27;s lines and took Batoche. Many Métis were saved because of the holes that were previously dug. For days afterwards, Dumont remained in the vicinity of Batoche to ensure that blankets were distributed to the now homeless Métis women and children. During this period Dumont also searched for Riel, who had surrendered to the Canadian soldiers in the interim on May 15. When Dumont learned of Riel&#x27;s fate, he quickly left Batoche and travelled to the United States.

After crossing the border into the United States via the Cypress Hills and Montana Territory, Dumont and his companion Michel Dumas were detained almost immediately. However, Dumont and Dumas were quickly released following a memo sent from the Oval Office ordering their release immediately. Although Dumont hid for some time in the United States, he was still wanted in Canada and had developed into something of a folk hero in Saskatchewan. While Dumont was indeed in hiding, it was rumoured that the soldiers looking for him made a rather feeble attempt to find him after learning that &quot;&quot;, his famous rifle, was still in his possession.

In July 1886 the Canadian government announced that amnesty was available to Dumont. He eventually returned to Batoche, where he spent time dictating two separate memoirs of the North-West Rebellion.

== Political history ==
Dumont&#x27;s hereditary skills gained from his heritage as a buffalo hunter quickly gave rise to his influence politically. By the year 1863, the ranks of the buffalo hunters amongst the Saskatchewan Métis numbered around 200 – enough to require some form of formal organization. In 1863 he was first elected as the hunt chief of the Saskatchewan Métis, a position he remained in until 1881 – around the time that the buffalo herds had almost entirely disappeared from the region that Dumont was hunt chief of. Dumont&#x27;s experience on the buffalo hunt gave him a great vision for the downturn of the buffalo trade during the 1870s.

He was known as a leader with a vision for the Métis, as he recognized that the declining numbers of the buffalo in Western Canada coupled with the encroaching Canadian agricultural movement spreading from the east would spark a great amount of change on the prairies. His political agenda consisted of maintaining the independence of the Saskatchewan Métis both politically and economically. In December 1873, after a meeting Dumont called in order to form a government for the Métis at St. Laurent (De Grandin), Dumont was immediately elected leader of the council of St. Laurent. Through his position as the leader of the council, Dumont created and put into place a constitution for the Métis that was followed for some time afterwards.

In his role as president of the council, Dumont&#x27;s responsibilities included overseeing a committee of elected Métis councillors, and mediating relations between the council and the people of St. Laurent. During this period of time the Canadian government had begun to lay claim to the position of governing body in the region, which sparked conflict with Dumont and his council. At first Dumont was passive, informing the government that the purpose of the local government was simply that – to govern locally. The goal of the council was not to form a rebellion according to Dumont. Reassured by Dumont&#x27;s implorements, colonial officials saw little cause to panic.

Incidentally however, Dumont did seek a degree of complete authority. When land surveyors from the Canadian government began to arrive in Saskatchewan during the 1870s, they showed a complete lack of regard for the Métis system of land tenure When the North-West Mounted Police arrived on the plains in 1874, it proved the volatility of the situation – Sir John A. Macdonald&#x27;s government had no plans to treat the Métis as a self-governing entity.

Dumont was re-elected president and leader of the council at St. Laurent in December 1874. In order to ensure that order was kept in the region, Dumont&#x27;s government attempted to impose fines on Métis who ignored the rules of the buffalo hunt. These individuals did not appreciate the tactics Dumont&#x27;s government was employing, and complained to the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company factor Lawrence Clarke. Clarke sent their concerns on to Lieutenant Governor Alexander Morris, claiming that the Métis were in open revolt against the Canadian government. After this incident the North-West Mounted Police were dispatched to investigate, and found no issue with Dumont&#x27;s dealings. However, the incident did spell the virtual end of the rule of the governing council at St. Laurent, although the council itself remained.

During the 1880s Dumont&#x27;s council sent petitions to the capital in Ottawa imploring the government to recognize the traditional land holdings (tenure) of the Métis. When these petitions went unanswered by the prime minister and his cabinet, Dumont and the Métis felt compelled to protect the land through a more direct method. In March 1884, a meeting was called by Dumont at the house of Abraham Montour, in which Dumont proceeded to call for Louis Riel to take up the mantle of leadership that Dumont had been previously holding. Subsequently, a delegation consisting of Dumont and three of his closest companions was sent to Riel requesting that he travel to Saskatchewan in order to provide insight into how best to protect Métis lands and freedoms. Dumont and three others travelled to St. Peter&#x27;s Jesuit Mission in Montana, and convinced Riel to ride north to Saskatchewan. From that point onwards, Dumont and Riel maintained a close friendship.

In March 1885, Dumont called a general meeting of the Métis of St. Laurent at Batoche. During the meeting, several of the indigenous people present suggested a more violent approach to proceedings – defending their lands against the Canadian government through the use of arms. By the conclusion of the meeting, a new provisional government had been formed led by Dumont, known as the Provisional Government of Saskatchewan. This new government served as a direct competitor to Ottawa&#x27;s rule. Dumont was chosen to be the adjutant governor of this new government. While Riel was officially the figurehead and overruled Dumont in terms of decision power, Dumont remained responsible for many of the Métis political and military decisions until his retirement from active governing duty.

==Later life and death==
During the years of the 1870s and the 1880s, Dumont owned a farm near the South Saskatchewan River, where he both worked the farm and operated a ferry across the South Saskatchewan nicknamed &quot;Gabriel&#x27;s Crossing&quot; around upstream from the ferry that Francois Xavier Letendre dit Batoche began around the same time. Dumont and his wife Madeleine were among the many Métis families that had been pushed out of Manitoba by the Canadian government.
In June 1886, Dumont was briefly employed in a western show named Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West Show, where he was billed as a desperado and a crack shot until the later half of the summer when he travelled to the northeastern States to engage in public speaking events and political campaigns. Dumont soon grew tired of politics and returned to the Wild West Show before settling down at a relative&#x27;s property to return to hunting, fishing and trapping in 1903. He died at the age of sixty-eight on 19 May 1906 in Batoche, the result of heart failure.

== Legacy ==
The legacy of Dumont as a Métis leader is one that is only outshone by that of Louis Riel. Gabriel Dumont has left a legacy behind that is known through schools, museums, institutions, books, and landmarks. In the spring of 2008, provincial Tourism, Parks, Culture and Sport Minister Christine Tell proclaimed at Duck Lake, that &quot;the 125th commemoration, in 2010, of the 1885 Northwest Rebellion is an excellent opportunity to tell the story of the Prairie Métis and First Nations peoples&#x27; struggle with government forces and how it has shaped Canada today.&quot; Batoche – the site of a Métis Provisional Government, has been declared a National Historic Site.

The Gabriel Dumont Institute of Native Studies and Applied Research in Saskatchewan was named in his honour when it was founded in 1980. In 1985, a scholarship fund was formed in his name with a $1.24-million capital investment. In 1993, an agreement was set up between the institute and the University of Saskatchewan creating the Gabriel Dumont College. The Gabriel Bridge was built in 1969 over the South Saskatchewan River east of Rosthern, Saskatchewan. It is located at the site of Gabriel&#x27;s Crossing, where he ran a small store, billiards hall, and ferry service in the late 1870s and early 1880s. In 1998, the public French-first-language high school in London, Ontario, was renamed École secondaire Gabriel-Dumont in Dumont&#x27;s honour.

<doc id="227637" wikidata="Q1020159" url="?curid=227637" title="Etobicoke">
<text>Etobicoke (, ) is an administrative district and former city within Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Comprising the city&#x27;s west end, Etobicoke is bordered on the south by Lake Ontario, on the east by the Humber River, on the west by Etobicoke Creek, the cities of Brampton, and Mississauga, the Toronto Pearson International Airport (a small portion of the airport extends into Etobicoke), and on the north by the city of Vaughan at Steeles Avenue West.

The area of Etobicoke was first settled by Europeans in the 1790s. Primarily an agricultural district, it was incorporated in 1850 as Etobicoke Township. The municipality grew into city status in the 20th century after World War II. Several independent villages and towns developed and became part of Etobicoke, first when Metropolitan Toronto was formed in 1954 and later, in a 1967 consolidation. In 1998, its city status and government dissolved after it was amalgamated into present-day Toronto.

Etobicoke has a highly diverse population, which numbered 365,143 in 2016. It is primarily suburban in development and heavily industrialized, resulting in a lower population density than the other districts of Toronto. Much of its cityscape is characterized by larger main streets, shopping malls, and cul-de-sac housing developments. Etobicoke has several expressways, including Highways 427, 401, 409, the Queen Elizabeth Way and Gardiner Expressway. Etobicoke is the western terminus of Line 2 Bloor-Danforth of the Toronto subway and is served by four suburban rail stations of GO Transit. Humber College is in Etobicoke, encompassing two campuses, one of which is also home to the University of Guelph-Humber.

==Toponymy==
The name &quot;Etobicoke&quot; derives from the Mississauga word &quot;wah-do-be-kang&quot; (&quot;wadoopikaang&quot;), meaning &quot;place where the alders grow&quot;. This was how they described the area between Etobicoke Creek and the Humber River. The first provincial land surveyor, Augustus Jones, also spelled it as &quot;ato-be-coake.&quot; Etobicoke was finally adopted as the official name in 1795 at the direction of Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe.

==History==
At different times throughout history, different groups of First Nations peoples used the land that is now present day Etobicoke. As the Algonquins gradually moved west from the Atlantic to Lake Erie, it is almost certain they would have occupied this land. By the time they were mostly settled on the shores of Georgian Bay, the Huron-Wendat were the primary residents of Lake Ontario&#x27;s north shore. During the 17th century, the powerful Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) confederacy, made up of nations based to the south of the lake, pushed them out.

After continued harassment from the Iroquois to the south, a coalition of the Ojibway, Odawa, and Potawatomi Algonquin nations, known as the Three Fires, gradually pushed the Haudenosaunee off this land. The Algonquian-speaking Mississaugas settled here by 1695, fishing and growing crops more locally in the summer and hunting farther afield in the winter.
The British officials intended Etobicoke to be included in the Toronto Purchase of 1787.

However, the Mississauga and government disagreed as to whether the western boundary of the purchase was the Humber River or the Etobicoke River (now, Etobicoke Creek). The Mississauga Indians allowed British surveyor Alexander Aitkin to survey the disputed land, and the British paid an additional 10 shillings for the purchase, although the purchase was never formally agreed to. The dispute was settled between the government and the Mississauga First Nation in 2010.

Immigrants from the British Isles were among the new settlers, as well as Loyalists who had left the rebellious Thirteen Colonies, by then the United States. Early settlers included many of the Queen&#x27;s Rangers, who Simcoe gave land to help protect the new capital of Upper Canada and develop this frontier area. In 1793-95, the Honourable Samuel Smith, a colonel in the Queen&#x27;s Rangers, received land grants of , extending from today&#x27;s Kipling Avenue to Etobicoke Creek, and north to Bloor Street.

On March 18, 1797, Sergeant Patrick Mealey received the first land patent for a plot on the west side of Royal York Road on Lake Ontario. This was part of the First Military Tract, or &quot;Militia Lands&quot;, which extended from today&#x27;s Royal York Road to Kipling Avenue, south from Bloor Street. The Crown was providing land to Loyalists in compensation for property they left behind in the U.S. and to veterans of the American Revolution in payment for service. In other parts of Ontario, the Crown granted land to the Iroquoian First Nations who had served as allies during the war and were forced to cede most of their land in New York to the state. The Crown granted more land to members of the Queen&#x27;s Rangers in the First Military tract, but most did not occupy their land. Many sold their acreage after a short time.

The census of 1805 counted 84 people in the township of Etobicoke. In 1806, William Cooper built a grist mill and saw mill on the Humber river&#x27;s west bank, just south of Dundas Street. The 1809 census counted 137 residents. The Dundas Street bridge opened in 1816, making the township more accessible.

On May 18, 1846, the Albion Road Company was incorporated. Its purpose was to build and maintain a road to the north-west corner of Etobicoke, where a new community was planned. At the same time, John Grubb, who had already founded Thistletown, hired land surveyor John Stoughton Dennis to plan a community at the intersection of Islington Avenue and Albion Road, to be named Saint Andrew&#x27;s. Plan 6 for this community was registered on October 15, 1847. The French master of Upper Canada College, Jean du Petit Pont de la Haye, contracted land surveyor James McCallum Jr. to create a plan for the community planned by the Albion Road Company, and Plan 28 was registered for Claireville on October 12, 1849.

The township of Etobicoke was incorporated on January 1, 1850. The first meeting of the town council was held on January 21. Present at the meeting were reeve William Gamble, vice-reeve W. B. Wadsworth and aldermen Moses Appleby, Thomas Fisher, and John Geddes. The council convened monthly meetings at a variety of places. In 1850, the township&#x27;s population was 2904. By 1881, the population of Etobicoke township was 2976.

In 1911, the community of Mimico was incorporated on land taken from Etobicoke township. New Toronto was incorporated on January 1, 1913. Early on, there was talk of merging Mimico and New Toronto. A 1916 referendum on amalgamating the two communities was approved by the residents of Mimico, but rejected by residents of New Toronto. In 1917, Mimico became a town and in 1920, New Toronto became the Town of New Toronto. Long Branch was incorporated in 1930 as a village.

In 1954, Etobicoke Township became a part of the newly formed regional government, the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto (&quot;Metro&quot;). In 1967, the township of Etobicoke was merged with three small lakeside municipalities — the Village of Long Branch, the Town of New Toronto, and the Town of Mimico — to form the Borough of Etobicoke. The borough was reincorporated as a city in 1984. In 1998, six local municipalities (including Etobicoke) and the Metropolitan Toronto government merged to form the amalgamated city of Toronto.

==Character==
Etobicoke has the lowest population density of the former cities and boroughs comprising the city of Toronto. This is mainly due to its expanses of industrial lands along the various expressways. 

The residential areas are primarily single-family dwellings, although several large multi-story high-rise condominium developments have been built in south Etobicoke near the Humber River over the past few years. The central and northern areas of Etobicoke have many high-density apartment complexes set in the middle of sizable, open fields and parks. The central/southern areas, such as Markland Wood, The Kingsway, New Toronto, Mimico and Long Branch, have large green spaces, many parks, and main street shopping areas. 

Etobicoke has many public parks. Located on the banks of the Humber River, James Gardens, a popular site for wedding photography, features seasonal flowers, walkways, a rock garden, streams, and waterfalls. Etobicoke also has Centennial Park, a large recreational park, and Colonel Samuel Smith Park and Humber Bay Park on the lakeshore. Etobicoke has several golf courses. St. George&#x27;s Golf and Country Club was ranked in 2007 as one of the three best golf courses in Canada.

===Neighbourhoods===
Etobicoke is generally divided into three large areas roughly corresponding to its political ridings. Each has neighbourhoods, mostly developments of 19th-century &#x27;postal villages&#x27; (rural neighbourhoods), that were built at key points along the early roads and railways; especially the three former &#x27;Lakeshore Municipalities&#x27; that separated from Etobicoke in the early 20th century and Etobicoke&#x27;s central Islington community:

The Lakeshore (Etobicoke—Lakeshore), along the north shore of Lake Ontario and the &quot;Lake Shore Road&quot; (now Lake Shore Boulevard West), comprises three former municipalities that were the first to urbanize and became separate municipalities during the first half of the 20th century: Mimico, New Toronto and Long Branch, and related communities that were never separate from the Township of Etobicoke; namely, Alderwood (originally a suburb of New Toronto), and Humber Bay (a historic gateway community connecting to Toronto) which was originally sprawl from the east side of the Humber River that was subsequently split by the construction of Ontario&#x27;s first motor vehicle &#x27;freeway&#x27; in 1938, which cuts across the top of southern Etobicoke; (the Queen Elizabeth Way).

Today, the original remnant residential (northern) section of Humber Bay is north of The Queensway, east of Mimico Creek to the Humber River. The commercial, southern section of Humber Bay retains only Christie&#x27;s Biscuits bakery, as high-rise condominium towers and clustered row housing have forced out virtually all other commercial/industrial employment uses. In the late 1990s, the former McGuiness Whisky factory was converted into a high-rise loft condominium which became the centrepiece of the Mystic Pointe development. Etobicoke&#x27;s first railway opened through the area in 1855, just north of the Lake Ontario shoreline, leading to the first period of growth as it replaced Dundas Street in Central Etobicoke as the main means of transportation and the industrial centre along its right-of-way.

Central Etobicoke (Etobicoke Centre); the oldest communities in Etobicoke developed along the first street, Dundas Street, in the south of this area, which crosses the width of Etobicoke on the escarpment formed by the ancient shoreline of Lake Iroquois. This area centres around the Islington community, the former administrative centre of Etobicoke and later Etobicoke&#x27;s &#x27;downtown&#x27; which is near the central &#x27;Six Points&#x27; intersection at its western boundary. The rural Richview community developed directly to the north of Islington in the 19th century on Eglinton Ave. (formerly Richview Rd.), as did the gateway Humber Heights communities (connecting to Toronto): Westmount and Humbervale, to the east on Eglinton. Development of the until-then largely undeveloped eastern part of central Etobicoke (originally a forest reserved for the use of government mills as &quot;The King&#x27;s Mill Reserve&quot;; &quot;Kingsmill&quot;), the &quot;Humber Valley&quot;, was largely the work of Robert Home Smith starting about 1900 and including the communities of The Kingsway and Humber Valley Village. The Kingsway neighbourhood has attracted many affluent individuals and families (as of 2001, over 50% of households have an income in excess of /year).

As Etobicoke developed in the post-war years, low-density residential areas filled in most of the rural areas between the old communities including Thorncrest Village, Princess-Rosethorn and Eringate – Centennial – West Deane as well as the older Eatonville community to the west of Islington. Central Etobicoke includes Etobicoke&#x27;s most exclusive neighbourhoods, with fine housing stock and many large treed properties. Along the East and West Mall parallel to Highway 427 exists a mix of hi-rise rentals, townhouses and post-war bungalows. Markland Wood is the farthest western community within Etobicoke/Toronto; situated along Bloor Street West, it is predominately single family housing with some mixed hi-rise rentals.

North Etobicoke; The 19th-century Etobicoke communities are Clairville, Highfield, Rexdale, Smithfield, Thistletown which grew along two formerly private roads (now Albion Rd. and Rexdale Blvd.) constructed diagonally across farms in Northern Etobicoke as a shortcut for travellers to Peel County (especially modern Brampton). First developed as an urban area by Rex Heslop in the post-World War II years around the new Rexdale (the Elms) community, northern Etobicoke has many apartment buildings as well as a large &#x27;skyway&#x27; industrial park to the west, developed after Malton Airport (in nearby Mississauga) became Toronto&#x27;s main &quot;Pearson International&quot; Airport.

==Demographics==

Most of Etobicoke&#x27;s visible minorities and immigrants reside in North Etobicoke, with 62% of its population being foreign-born. Many people from India, Jamaica, Iraq, Guyana, Somalia, Ghana, Philippines, Nigeria, Pakistan and Bangladesh have settled in North Etobicoke. Etobicoke&#x27;s central and south end has a large European population from countries such as Italy, Poland, former Yugoslavia, and Ukraine, and some of the wealthiest neighbourhoods in Toronto such as The Kingsway.
As of 2016, English was the most spoken language in Etobicoke, followed by (in order) Italian, Punjabi, Spanish, Polish, Ukrainian, Gujarati, and Portuguese.

==Economy==

Islington–City Centre West is one of several central business districts outside of downtown Toronto. Pizza Pizza and Sunwing Airlines have their headquarters in Etobicoke. Skyservice and Canada 3000 had their headquarters in Etobicoke before the closure of these airlines.

The construction industry in Etobicoke has been booming, with many new condominium towers developed along the waterfront near Humber Bay and along Bloor street. This has helped increase Etobicoke&#x27;s population after a brief decline. The area&#x27;s film and television industry is also promising.

Etobicoke is home to a rib fest held every year on Canada Day long weekend at Centennial Park. The weekend is filled with entertainment, food, midway, and music.

==Education==
Four public school boards offer primary education and secondary education for residents living in Etobicoke, Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir (CSCM), Conseil scolaire Viamonde (CSV), the Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB), and the Toronto District School Board (TDSB). CSV and TDSB operate as secular public school boards, the former operating French first language institution, whereas the latter operated English first language institutions. The other two school boards, CSCM and TCDSB, operate as public separate school boards, the former operating French first language separate schools, the latter operating English first language separate schools. Before 1998, the boards were responsible for the education in Etobicoke were the Etobicoke Board of Education for anglophone public secular schools and the Metropolitan Separate School Board for anglophone and francophone Roman Catholic separate schools.

In addition to primary and secondary schools, two post-secondary institutions are within Etobicoke. Humber College is a public college that operates two campuses in Etobicoke, the Humber North campus, and the Lakeshore campus, on the corner of Efstathia Avenue and Kourabiedes Lane. The University of Guelph-Humber is another post-secondary institution in Etobicoke that is jointly operated by Humber College, and the University of Guelph, based in Guelph, Ontario. Guelph-Humber is not an independent degree-granting institution, with its degrees and diplomas issued from Humber College, or the University of Guelph.

===History===
In 1924, Mimico High School was opened in the village of Mimico. This was followed by Etobicoke Collegiate Institute in 1928 in central Etobicoke. Today, the Mimico school building is used by John English Junior Middle School.

Other secondary schools were built:

*Royal York Collegiate Institute (1953)
*Alderwood Collegiate Institute (1955)
*Burnhamthorpe Collegiate Institute (1956)
*Thistletown Collegiate Institute (1957)
*Richview Collegiate Institute (1958)
*Kipling Collegiate Institute (1960)
*Vincent Massey Collegiate Institute (1961)
*North Albion Collegiate Institute (1962)
*Scarlett Heights Collegiate Institute (1963)
*Silverthorn Collegiate Institute (1964)
*Martingrove Collegiate Institute (1966)
*West Humber Collegiate Institute (1966)
*Kellier Mackay Collegiate Institute (1971)
*Michael Power/St. Joseph High School (1981)
*Father John Redmond Catholic Secondary School (1986)
*Bishop Allen Academy (1989)
In the village of New Toronto, New Toronto Secondary School was constructed in 1949 and opened in 1950 as a vocational trade school. Beginning in 1963, Kingsmill Vocational School, a junior vocational school, opened at a King&#x27;s Mill site and two other schools erected: Humbergrove Vocational School to the north in 1965 and Westway Vocational School in 1969.

At its peak, Etobicoke operated 14 collegiates and 4 vocational schools in 1980. Downsizing occurred in the 1980s when nine high schools were closed due to declining enrollment; Alderwood and New Toronto merged to form Lakeshore Collegiate Institute in 1983 while Humbergrove, Kingsmill and Westway were consolidated to form Central Etobicoke High School in 1988.

Etobicoke&#x27;s first Roman Catholic high school, Michael Power/St. Joseph High School was first opened in 1949 as St. Joseph&#x27;s High School in the village of Islington with 150 girls by the Sisters of St. Joseph. Next door, the Basilian Fathers established an all-boys school Michael Power High School in 1957. In September 1982, the two schools were merged. Today, Michael Power/St. Joseph serves many students in the southern and central Etobicoke areas predominantly populated by Polish and Ukrainian Byzantine Catholics, who attend southern Etobicoke&#x27;s two other high schools: Father John Redmond Catholic Secondary School (1986) and Bishop Allen Academy (1989).

The first art school in Etobicoke is the Etobicoke School of the Arts established in 1981. Father John Redmond was designated as the Regional Arts Centre in 2006.

==Sport==
Etobicoke has a wide range of indoor and outdoor sporting leagues including baseball, soccer, gridiron football, ice hockey, and ringette. Some of the prominent clubs include the Etobicoke Kangaroos Australian rules football club, the Serbian White Eagles FC club, Toronto Croatia, and FC Ukraine United, which operate in the Canadian Soccer League, and the Toronto Furies of the Canadian Women&#x27;s Hockey League.

Southern Etobicoke is home to the Ford Performance Centre, the home arena for the Toronto Furies, and the practice rink of the Toronto Maple Leafs. The Toronto Patriots of the Ontario Junior Hockey League are based in Etobicoke. Etobicoke is the hometown of Major League Baseball star Joey Votto as well as National Hockey League stars P. K. Subban, Connor Brown, brothers Brendan and Reilly Smith, and National Hockey League Hall of Famer Brendan Shanahan. Etobicoke&#x27;s Centennial Park is a large green space in west Toronto which is a venue for soccer, basketball, skiing, ice hockey, rugby, hiking, track and field. Rexdale (North Etobicoke) is home to the top ranked high school basketball program in Canada, Henry Carr Crusaders. Producing notable US Division 1 and NBA players such as Tyler Ennis and Sim Bhullar. Henry Carr Crusaders were the 2016 AAA Provincial high school basketball champions.

==Transportation==
Several major expressways, such as Ontario Highways 427, 401, 409, and 27, the Queen Elizabeth Way, as well as the city-maintained Gardiner Expressway, are routed through the area. There are numerous four- and six-lane thoroughfares in Etobicoke, laid out in a grid system. Many exceptions to Toronto&#x27;s gridded street matrix are found in Etobicoke. A number of overpasses and awkward intersections have been created in an effort to reconcile the grid with these planning anomalies. 

Public transportation is primarily provided by the Toronto Transit Commission&#x27;s (TTC) bus, streetcar, and subway system. Line 2 Bloor-Danforth of the TTC subway system has its western terminus at Kipling, along with three other stations. Both Kipling and Islington stations are major transit hubs, with the former serving as a terminal for MiWay bus services to Mississauga. Former transit expansion plans in Etobicoke, including the Eglinton West subway and the extension of Line 2 from Kipling to Square One Bus Terminal in Mississauga, were cancelled by previous provincial governments. Future transit expansion plans include two light rail transit projects, namely the Eglinton line extension from the future Mount Dennis station to Toronto Pearson International Airport and a new Finch West line between University of Guelph-Humber (Humber College North Campus) and Finch West station.

Etobicoke is also home to four GO stations: Etobicoke North station on the Kitchener line, Kipling station on the Milton line, as well as Long Branch and Mimico stations on the Lakeshore West line.

<text>Alvin Stanley Schwartz (November 17, 1916 – October 28, 2011) was an American comic book writer best known for his Batman and Superman stories. He was also a novelist, poet, and essayist.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Alvin Schwartz debuted in comics with an issue of &quot;Fairy Tale Parade&quot; in 1939. He then wrote extensively for Sheldon Mayer at All-American Publications and then for National Comics, two of the three companies which merged to form DC Comics.

===Golden Age of comics books===
Schwartz wrote his first Batman story in 1942, expanding into the Batman newspaper comic strip in August 1944 and the Superman strip two months later. Through 1952, he scripted for most of the company&#x27;s newspaper strips. For rival Fawcett Comics, he wrote stories for Superman&#x27;s chief competitor Captain Marvel.

===1950s===
Until ending his association with DC in 1958, Schwartz contributed comic-book scripts for such superheroes as Aquaman, Wonder Woman, the Flash, Green Lantern, the Newsboy Legion, Vigilante, Slam Bradley, and Tomahawk. He also wrote comic books such as &quot;A Date With Judy&quot;, &quot;Buzzy&quot;, and &quot;House of Mystery&quot;. Among Schwartz&#x27;s contributions to Superman was writing the first tale of Bizarro, denizen of an opposite, interdimensional world where &quot;hello&quot; means &quot;goodbye&quot;, and citizens do good by doing bad. He wrote &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot; #71 (July 1954), the issue which began featuring Superman and Batman in the same story together.
Schwartz left DC after clashing repeatedly with the new Superman-line editor Mort Weisinger.

===Corporate work===
After leaving DC, Schwartz went into corporate market research and helped develop such techniques as psychographics and typological identification. As research director for Dr. Ernst Dichter&#x27;s Institute for Motivational Research, he provided structural and marketing advice to corporations such as General Motors and General Foods. He later joined the advisory committee of the American Association of Advertising Agencies.

===Other writing===
Schwartz wrote three novels for Arco Press, one of which, the detective story &quot;Sword of Desire&quot;, won praise for its takeoff on Wilhelm Reich&#x27;s orgone therapy, a popular psychotherapeutic technique used during the 1940s and 1950s. His proto-Beat novel &quot;The Blowtop&quot; was published by Dial Press in 1948. Under the title &quot;Le Cinglé&quot;, it became a best-seller in France.

In 1968, Schwartz moved to Canada, where he wrote documentaries and docudramas for the National Film Board of Canada for nearly 20 years, and created several economic and social studies for the Government of Canada. Additionally, Schwartz wrote and lectured on superheroes, and received a Canada Council Grant for a study on religious symbolism in popular culture, using Superman as a springboard.

===Later life and career===
In 1997, Schwartz published an autobiography titled &quot;An Unlikely Prophet&quot;. In it, he wrote that Superman had attained the status of a tulpa, an entity that according to Buddhist beliefs attains reality solely by the act of imagination. Schwartz claimed he had actually met the superhero in a New York cab. In the mid-2000s, Schwartz wrote a weekly web column.

Schwartz and his wife lived in the rural village of Chesterville near Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. He died in 2011 of heart-related complications.

==Awards==
Schwartz and writer-editor Harvey Kurtzman were awarded the 2006 Bill Finger Award for Excellence in Comic Book Writing.

<text>Pretty Hate Machine is the debut studio album by the American industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails, released by TVT Records on October 20, 1989. Frontman Trent Reznor sang and performed most of the instruments, also producing the album alongside Keith LeBlanc, John Fryer and Flood, with a few other contributors.

The album features a heavily synthesizer-driven electronic sound blended with industrial and rock elements. Much like the band&#x27;s later work, the album&#x27;s lyrics contain themes of angst, betrayal, and lovesickness. The record was promoted with the singles &quot;Down in It&quot;, &quot;Head Like a Hole&quot;, and &quot;Sin&quot;, as well as the accompanying tour. A remastered edition was released in 2010.

Although the record was successful, reaching No. 75 in the US and receiving highly favorable reviews from critics, Reznor feuded with TVT over promotion of the album and eventually signed with Interscope Records. &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot; was later certified triple-platinum by RIAA, becoming one of the first independently released albums to do so, and was included on several lists of the best releases of the 1980s. In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot; at number 453 on its &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; list.

==Background==
While working nights as a handyman and engineer at the Right Track Studio in Cleveland, Ohio, Reznor used studio &quot;down-time&quot; to record and develop his own music. Playing most of the keyboards, drum machines, guitars, and samplers himself, he recorded a demo. The sequencing was done on a Macintosh Plus. Reznor mainly used an E-mu Emax, Prophet VS, Oberheim Xpander, and Minimoog as synthesizers.

With the help of manager John Malm Jr., he sent the demo to various record labels. Reznor received contract offers from many of the labels, but eventually signed with TVT Records, who were known mainly for releasing novelty and television jingle records. &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot; was recorded in various studios with Reznor collaborating with some of his most idolized producers: Flood, Keith LeBlanc, Adrian Sherwood, and John Fryer. Much like his recorded demo, Reznor refused to record the album with a conventional band, recording &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot; mostly by himself.

&quot;A lot of it sounds immature to me now,&quot; he stated in 1991 of the recordings that were then two years old. &quot;At first it totally sucked. I became completely withdrawn. I couldn&#x27;t function in society very well. And the LP became a product of that. It&#x27;s quite small scale, introverted, claustrophobic – that&#x27;s the feel I went for.&quot;

Reznor discussed the recording and touring of &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot; in the April 1990 issue of &quot;Keyboard&quot;. He used an E-mu Emax because it produced a high-end buzzing noise when transposing down sounds. Rough and first takes of vocals and guitar were used to contrast the quantized drums and bass. Reznor hated the factory sounds of the Emax but had not transferred anything from his old Emulator, and used samples from his record collection for all the drum sounds. He initially expected to use real drum sounds when recording the album, but in the end he and the producers merely equalized his drum samples.

After the album was released, a recording known as &quot;Purest Feeling&quot; surfaced. The bootleg album contains early rehearsal recordings of many of the tracks featured on &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot;, as well as a couple that were not used (&quot;Purest Feeling&quot;, &quot;Maybe Just Once&quot;, and an instrumental introduction to &quot;Sanctified&quot; called &quot;Slate&quot;). These early songs also featured Chris Vrenna (who initially played keyboards/samplers in the band) and original drummer Ron Musarra.

==Music and lyrics==
Unlike the industrial music of Nine Inch Nails&#x27; contemporaries, &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot; displays catchy riffs and verse-chorus song structures rather than repetitive electronic beats. Reznor&#x27;s lyrics express adolescent angst and feelings of betrayal by lovers, society, or God. Themes of despair are collocated with lovesick sentiments. &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Tom Breihan categorized it as a synth-pop album that was shaped by industrial music&#x27;s &quot;nascent new-wave period rather than its subsequent styles.&quot; According to Breihan, the beats were muscular, but not in the vein of metal or post-punk, and that the most rock-inspired song on the album was &quot;Head Like a Hole&quot;.

Journalist Jon Pareles described the album as &quot;electro-rock or industrial rock, using drum machines, computerized synthesizer riffs and obviously processed sounds to detail, and usually denounce, an artificial world.&quot; Tom Popson of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; called it a dance album partly characterized by industrial dance&#x27;s aggressive sound: &quot;Reznor&#x27;s electronics-plus-guitar LP also carries a brighter techno-pop element that might remind some of Depeche Mode. Things occasionally mellow out to moody atmospherics, while Reznor&#x27;s vocals range from whispers to screams.&quot; &quot;PopMatters&quot;″ AJ Ramirez regarded the album as &quot;a synthesizer-dominated industrial dance record that on occasion slipped under the alternative rock banner.&quot;

Reznor has humorously described &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot; as &quot;the all-purpose alternative album,&quot; remarking that &quot;if you want to stage dive to it, you can, but if you&#x27;re a big Depeche Mode fan, you can get what you need out of it as well.&quot; Reznor further stated: &quot;I like electronic music, but I like it to have some aggression. That &#x27;first wave&#x27; of electro music – Human League and Devo – that&#x27;s the easiest way to use it. To be able to get some humanity and aggression into it in a cool way, that&#x27;s the thing ... &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot; is a record you can listen to and get more out of each time. To me, something like Front 242 is the opposite: great at first but, after 10 listens, that&#x27;s it.&quot; Reznor additionally cited Depeche Mode&#x27;s 1986 album &quot;Black Celebration&quot; as a driving influence, stating that &quot;DM was one of our favorite bands and the &quot;Black Celebration&quot; record took my love for them to a new level.&quot;

In a commentary on the album, Tom Hull said that Reznor&#x27;s &quot;notion of industrial is closer to New Order new wave, but with a harder metallic gleam and more dystopian attitude.&quot;

===Samples===
Prince, Jane&#x27;s Addiction, and Public Enemy are listed in the liner notes as artists whose music was sampled on the album. Segments of Prince&#x27;s &quot;Alphabet St.&quot; and Jane&#x27;s Addiction&#x27;s &quot;Had a Dad&quot; can be heard in &quot;Ringfinger&quot;. Other samples were edited or distorted so as to be unrecognizable, such as the introduction to &quot;Kinda I Want To&quot;. &quot;Something I Can Never Have&quot; features unused backing tracks created by John Fryer for This Mortal Coil.

Reznor stated, &quot;I was tempted to lay in more of other people‘s stuff, but I thought that would lend a real dated quality to the record, seeing where that has gone the way it has in hip-hop.&quot; Time constraints similarly prevented him from accumulating &quot;good sounds&quot; as he wanted. He obtained &quot;weird percussion tracks&quot; by sampling loops from artists like Public Enemy, playing them backwards and modulating them in Macintosh Turbosynth with an oscillator tuned to the pitch of the song, obtaining &quot;this weird flanging-type thing that&#x27;s in key&quot;. He said that &quot;every drum fill on &#x27;Terrible Lie&#x27; is lifted intact from somewhere. There are six other songs playing through that cut, recorded on tape, in and out, depending on where they worked.&quot;

==Cover art==
The cover art was designed by Gary Talpas, which is a photo of the blades of a turbine stretched vertically to create the illusion of a rib cage. For the 2010 reissue, visual artist Rob Sheridan was assigned to update the cover art by Reznor to tone down the heavy late-Eighties neon aesthetic. Unfortunately, Sheridan was unable to locate the original artwork as it was deemed lost forever. To remedy this, he had to reverse engineer the cover art by scanning the existing cover art and digitally painted the image in very high resolution.

==Touring==
In 1990, Reznor quickly formed a band, hiring guitarist Richard Patrick who would later form Filter. The live band began the &quot;Pretty Hate Machine Tour Series&quot;, in which they toured North America as an opening act for alternative rock artists such as Peter Murphy and The Jesus and Mary Chain. Nine Inch Nails&#x27; live set at the time was known for louder, more aggressive versions of the studio songs. At some point, Reznor began smashing his equipment onstage (Reznor preferred using the heel of his boots to strip the keys from expensive keyboards, most notably the Yamaha DX7); Nine Inch Nails then embarked on a world tour that continued through the first Lollapalooza festival in 1991 and culminated in an opening slot to support Guns N&#x27; Roses on their European tour.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot; received widespread acclaim from music critics, who praised the production and Reznor&#x27;s vocals. In a contemporary review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Michael Azerrad called &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot; &quot;industrial-strength noise over a pop framework&quot; and &quot;harrowing but catchy music&quot;; Reznor proclaimed this combination &quot;a sincere statement&quot; of &quot;what was in [his] head at the time&quot;. Robert Hilburn found Reznor&#x27;s &quot;dark obsession&quot; compelling in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, while &quot;Q&quot;″s Martin Aston said Reznor &quot;scans the spectrum of modern dance&quot; with a &quot;panoramic vision&quot; that is &quot;both admirably adventurous and yet accessible.&quot; &quot;Select&quot; critic Neil Perry said that record was &quot;a flawed but listenable labour of loathing&quot;. Ralph Traitor of &quot;Sounds&quot; said that &quot;Reznor has guts, and they make his &quot;Machine&quot; one to be treated with respect&quot;, finding that the album was comparable to releases by Ministry and Foetus.

Jon Pareles was less impressed in his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, writing that &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot; &quot;stays so close to the conventions established by Depeche Mode, Soft Cell and New Order that it could be a parody album&quot;. Mark Jenkins of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; found the music &quot;competent but undistinctive stuff&quot; and believed the &quot;angry denunciations&quot; of songs such as &quot;Terrible Lie&quot; are overshadowed by the &quot;nursery-rhyme&quot; chants of &quot;Down in It&quot;. Tom Popson wrote in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; that &quot;the playing and production get points for introducing some variety to the industrial style, but the moments of soap-on-a-rope singing tend to cancel them out.&quot;

In a retrospective review, AllMusic editor Steve Huey commended Reznor for giving &quot;industrial music a human voice, a point of connection&quot; with his &quot;tortured confusion and self-obsession&quot;, and felt that &quot;the greatest achievement of &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot; was that it brought emotional extravagance to a genre whose main theme had nearly always been dehumanization.&quot; Upon its 2010 reissue, Will Hermes of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called it &quot;the first industrial singer-songwriter album&quot; and commended the sound produced by Flood and Keith LeBlanc, who he said &quot;taught Reznor a lot.&quot; Kyle Ryan of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; felt that the album &quot;remains the work of an artist just discovering his voice&quot; and said that &quot;20 years later, it doesn&#x27;t warrant repeat listens like its successors.&quot; He found some of its synth and sampled sounds to still be dated after the album&#x27;s remastering and Reznor&#x27;s lyrics &quot;mopey&quot; and &quot;silly&quot;. In an interview with &quot;Blender&quot;, journalist and novelist Chuck Palahniuk said that the album &quot;seemed like the first honest piece of music I ever heard.&quot; In 2020, &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot; was included at number 453 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; list.

==Commercial performance==
Released on October 20, 1989, &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot; was a commercial success and entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in February 1990. Although it peaked at number 75 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the album gained popularity through word of mouth and developed an underground following. &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot; was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on March 3, 1992, a few years after the album&#x27;s initial release, for shipping 500,000 units in the USA. Three years later in 1995, it became one of the first independently released records to attain a Platinum certification. It eventually garnered a triple Platinum certification on May 12, 2003, with three million copies sold in the United States. &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot; spent a total of 115 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, tying their sophomore album, &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; as their longest charting effort.

The album was also certified Silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on November 1, 1995, following its number 67 peak on the UK Albums Chart.

==Reissue==
&quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot; went out of print through TVT, but was reissued by Rykodisc on November 22, 2005, with slightly modified packaging. Reznor had expressed interest in making a deluxe edition with surround sound remastering and new remixes, similar to the rerelease of &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;. Rykodisc initially accepted the idea, but wanted Reznor to pay the production costs.

On March 29, 2010, the recording rights to &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot; were acquired by the Bicycle Music Company and on October 22, 2010, Reznor announced that a remastered edition would be released the following month. The remaster included new cover art by Rob Sheridan and the bonus track &quot;Get Down, Make Love&quot;, a Queen cover originally from the &quot;Sin&quot; single. The 2010 reissue was mastered by Tom Baker at the Precision Mastering in Hollywood, California.

&quot;&quot;PHM 2.0&quot; is far brighter and clearer than its original incarnation,&quot; observed &quot;Classic Rock&quot;, &quot;but ultimately it&#x27;s the strength of the songwriting… that shines through. Although that said, a super bass beef-up job on an already infamous cover of Queen&#x27;s &#x27;Get Down, Make Love&#x27; ups the sleaze &#x27;n&#x27; grind quotient no end.&quot;

Before the album&#x27;s rerelease, a fan website was launched featuring touring information for &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot;, the videos for &quot;Head Like a Hole&quot; and &quot;Down in It&quot; (with remastered sound), the uncut video for &quot;Sin&quot; (a remix for the video was used) and two early live segments, one with interviews.

The album and its respective singles were included in a Record Store Day Black Friday exclusive box set, &quot;Halo I–IV&quot; in 2015.

<doc id="227649" wikidata="Q902850" url="?curid=227649" title="The Fragile">
<text>The Fragile is the third studio album by the American industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails, released as a double album by Nothing Records and Interscope Records on September 21, 1999. It was produced by Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor and the English producer Alan Moulder, a longtime Reznor collaborator. It was recorded throughout 1997 to 1999 in New Orleans.

Looking to depart from the distorted production of their previous album, &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; (1994), the album features elements of ambient and electronic music within a wide variety of genres. The album continues some of the lyrical themes from &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;, including depression and drug abuse. The album notably contains more instrumental sections than their previous work, with some entire tracks being instrumentals. &quot;The Fragile&quot; is also one of the band&#x27;s longest studio releases, clocking in at nearly 1 hour and 45 minutes long. The record was promoted with three singles: &quot;The Day the World Went Away&quot;, &quot;We&#x27;re in This Together&quot;, and &quot;Into the Void&quot;, as well as the promotional single &quot;Starfuckers, Inc.&quot; and an accompanying tour, the Fragility Tour, which spanned two legs. Several accompanying recordings were also released, including a remix album, &quot;Things Falling Apart&quot; (2000), a live album, &quot;And All That Could Have Been&quot; (2002), as well as an alternate version of the record, &quot;The Fragile: Deviations 1&quot; (2016).

Upon release, critics applauded the album&#x27;s ambition and composition, although some criticized its length and perceived lack of lyrical substance. However, in the years following its release, it has come to be regarded by many critics and listeners to be among the band&#x27;s best work. The album debuted at number one in the U.S. to become the band&#x27;s first chart-topper, and was eventually certified double platinum by the RIAA.

==Writing and recording==
&quot;The Fragile&quot; was produced by Trent Reznor and Alan Moulder at Nothing Studios in New Orleans. There were some personnel changes within Nine Inch Nails after the Self-Destruct tour, which saw drummer Chris Vrenna replaced by Bill Rieflin and Jerome Dillon, the latter of whom would become Nine Inch Nails&#x27; full-time drummer until late 2005. Charlie Clouser and Danny Lohner contributed occasional instrumentation and composition to several tracks although the album was predominantly written and performed by Reznor alone. &quot;The Fragile&quot; was mixed by Alan Moulder and mastered by Tom Baker. The packaging was created by David Carson and Rob Sheridan.

According to a February 2000 interview in Keyboard Magazine, two of the album&#x27;s programmers, Charlie Clouser and Keith Hillbrandt, disclosed some synths used in the album&#x27;s production, among them: Clavia Nord Lead 2, Waldorf Pulse and Microwave, Minimoog, Oberheim Xpander, Novation Bass Station, Sequential Circuits Prophet-VS, and the Access Virus.

== Music and lyrics ==
Over a year before the album&#x27;s release, Reznor suggested, perhaps with intentional or dismissive misdirection, that the album would &quot;be irritating to people because it&#x27;s not traditional Nine Inch Nails. Think of the most ridiculous music you could ever imagine with nursery rhymes over the top of it. A bunch of pop songs.&quot;

In contrast to the heavily distorted instruments and gritty industrial sounds of their previous album, &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;, &quot;The Fragile&quot; relies more on soundscapes, electronic beats, ambient noise, rock-laden guitar, and the usage of melodies as harmonies. Several critics noted that the album was seemingly influenced by progressive rock, art rock, electronica, and avant-garde music. It is categorized as an art rock album by &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), Edna Gundersen of &quot;USA Today&quot;, and Will Hermes of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;. Hermes views that, like &quot;art-rockers&quot; King Crimson and David Bowie, Reznor incorporates elements of 20th-century classical music on the album, &quot;mixing prepared piano melodies à la John Cage with thematic flavor from Claude Debussy&quot;. Music journalist Ann Powers observes elements of progressive rock bands King Crimson and Roxy Music, Reznor&#x27;s influences, and the experimentation of electronica artists such as Autechre and Squarepusher, and writes that &quot;The Fragile&quot; uses funk bass lines, North African minor-key modalities, and the treatment of tonality by Symbolist composers like Debussy. The album also features several distorted guitar parts which Powers suggests that fans can enjoy. Rob Sheffield observes a &quot;prog-rock vibe&quot; akin to Pink Floyd&#x27;s 1979 album &quot;The Wall&quot; and feels that &quot;The Fragile&quot; is similarly &quot;a double album that vents ... alienation and misery into paranoid studio hallucinations, each track crammed with overdubs until there&#x27;s no breathing room&quot;.
Described by Reznor as a sequel to &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;—an album with a plot detailing the destruction of a man—&quot;The Fragile&quot; is a concept album dealing with his personal issues, including depression, angst, and drug abuse. His vocals, for the most part, are more melodic and somewhat softer, a departure from his harsh and often angry singing in previous works. However, several music critics including Reznor noticed the lack of lyrics on the album. &quot;The Bulletin&quot; interprets it as an industrial rock album about &quot;fear and loathing that could compete with Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Wall&quot;&quot;. In some ways, &quot;The Fragile&quot; is a response to &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;. Reznor compared the lyrical content of the two albums:

The song &quot;I&#x27;m Looking Forward to Joining You, Finally&quot; is credited in the album&#x27;s booklet as &quot;for clara&quot;, suggesting that the song&#x27;s topic, like &quot;The Day the World Went Away&quot;, is about Reznor&#x27;s grandmother, Clara Clark. 

&quot;Fight Club&quot; author Chuck Palahniuk singled out &quot;The Wretched&quot; for comment: &quot;I remember being amazed when I first heard this... This wasn&#x27;t just ennui: this was an active, aggressive, angry lack of caring. It&#x27;s not &#x27;Let&#x27;s kill ourselves&#x27;; it&#x27;s &#x27;Let&#x27;s kill each other&#x27;... It&#x27;s not rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll and it&#x27;s not classical. It&#x27;s something in between.&quot;

According to a CIA document entitled &quot;Guidelines for Interrogation Methods&quot; the song &quot;Somewhat Damaged&quot; was one of 13 songs played to detainees at Guantanamo Bay, supposedly as a means of torture.

==Packaging==
The cover artwork was designed by David Carson. A section within his book &quot;Fotografiks&quot; reveals that the top section of the album cover is from a photo of a waterfall and the bottom section is from a closeup photo of the inside of a seashell. Carson elaborated on this further in an image on his website:

==Promotion==
On September 10, 1998, at the 1998 MTV Video Music Awards, a thirty-second teaser trailer was shown on television to promote the then untitled album. It would be more than a year before the album was finally released. The first single, &quot;The Day the World Went Away&quot;, was released two months before the album. &quot;Into the Void&quot; and &quot;We&#x27;re in This Together&quot; proved to be the album&#x27;s most successful singles. The B-side &quot;Starfuckers, Inc.&quot; was released on the album as a track at the last minute , and served as a promotional single for &quot;The Fragile&quot;. In support of &quot;The Fragile&quot;, the Nine Inch Nails live band reformed for the Fragility tour. The tour began in late 1999 and lasted until mid-2000, spanning Europe, Japan, New Zealand, Australia, and North America. The tour consisted of two major legs, labeled Fragility 1.0 and Fragility 2.0. The live band lineup remained largely the same from the previous tour in support of &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;, featuring Robin Finck on guitar, Charlie Clouser on keyboards, and Danny Lohner on bass guitar. Reznor held open auditions to find a new drummer, eventually picking then-unknown Jerome Dillon. Nine Inch Nails&#x27; record label at the time, Interscope Records, reportedly refused to fund the promotional tour following &quot;The Fragile&quot;&#x27;s lukewarm sales. Reznor instead committed to fund the entire tour himself, which quickly sold out. He concluded that &quot;the reality is, I&#x27;m broke at the end of the tour&quot;, but also added, &quot;I will never present a show that isn&#x27;t fantastic.&quot; The tour featured increasingly large production values, including a triptych video display created by contemporary video artist Bill Viola. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine named Fragility the best tour of 2000. In 2002, the tour documentary &quot;And All That Could Have Been&quot; was released featuring performances from the Fragility 2.0 tour. While making the DVD, Reznor commented on the tour in retrospect by saying &quot;I thought the show was really, really good when we were doing it&quot;, but later wrote that &quot;I can&#x27;t watch it at all. I was sick for most of that tour and I really don&#x27;t think it was Nine Inch Nails at its best.&quot;

===Reissue===
On September 21, 2009—the tenth anniversary of the album&#x27;s release—a Nine Inch Nails official Twitter update hinted that a deluxe 5.1 surround audio reissue of &quot;The Fragile&quot; was in the works and was scheduled for a 2010 release.

During an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot; that was broadcast on January 7, 2011, after questioned about the album Reznor explained:

While on tour in 2014 in Australia and New Zealand, Reznor was interviewed by a local reporter and was quoted about the reissue stating:

In June 2015, an instrumental version of the album was released to Apple Music. This version of the album also includes alternative versions of &quot;The Frail&quot;, &quot;Just Like You Imagined&quot;, &quot;Pilgrimage&quot;, &quot;La Mer&quot;, &quot;The Mark Has Been Made&quot;, and &quot;Complication&quot;, the instrumental version of &quot;The Day the World Went Away (Quiet)&quot;, an extended version of &quot;+Appendage&quot;, a demo version of &quot;10 Miles High&quot; called &quot;Hello, Everything Is Not OK&quot;, and two previously unreleased tracks from &quot;The Fragile&quot; (&quot;The March&quot; and &quot;Can I Stay Here?&quot;)

In 2017 a reissue of the vinyl version of &quot;The Fragile&quot; was released, alongside an expanded, instrumental version, titled &quot;The Fragile: Deviations 1.&quot; This version of &quot;The Fragile&quot; contains all songs in either instrumental or alternate formats, and combines them with newly released songs written and recorded during the sessions for &quot;The Fragile&quot;. &quot;Deviations 1&quot; consists of a one-off 4×LP pressing.

==Critical reception==

&quot;The Fragile&quot; received generally positive reviews from contemporary critics. &quot;Mojo&quot; called it &quot;an impressively multi-textured, satisfyingly violent sonic workout&quot;, and &quot;Alternative Press&quot; found it &quot;nothing short of astounding&quot;. Edna Gundersen of &quot;USA Today&quot; called it &quot;meticulously honed and twisted to baffle, tantalize, disarm and challenge the listener&quot;, and wrote that &quot;the coats of polish ... can&#x27;t camouflage Trent Reznor&#x27;s perverse and subversive paths to musical glory.&quot; Ann Powers of &quot;Spin&quot; called the album &quot;a good old-fashioned strap-on-your-headphones experience&quot;. Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that, although he &quot;doesn&#x27;t approach suicide as he did on&quot; &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;, &quot;Reznor can hide in the studio and piece together music that&#x27;s as cunning, and disquieting, as his raw anger used to be.&quot; Will Hermes of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; viewed that, even &quot;if [Reznor&#x27;s] emotional palette is limited, it remains broader than any of his metalhead peers&quot;, and that, &quot;right now, hard rock simply doesn&#x27;t get any smarter, harder, or more ambitious than this.&quot; Robert Hilburn of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that, despite its length, &quot;this is a profoundly challenging and moving work that strikes at the hollowness of most contemporary pop-rock with bullwhip force.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Adam Sweeting praised it as &quot;a fearsomely accomplished mix of monster riffing, brooding melodies and patches of minimalist soul-searching&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writer Rob Sheffield felt that the album&#x27;s &quot;excess is Reznor&#x27;s chosen shock tactic here, and what&#x27;s especially shocking is how much action he packs into his digital via dolorosa.&quot;

In a negative review, &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Brent DiCrescenzo panned the album&#x27;s lyrics as &quot;overly melodramatic&quot;. John Aizlewood of &quot;Q&quot; felt that it is &quot;let down by Reznor&#x27;s refusal to trouble himself with melody and by some embarrassing lyrics&quot;. &quot;NME&quot;″s Victoria Segal panned its music as &quot;background&quot; and accused it of &quot;chas[ing] &#x27;crossover&#x27;&quot;, with &quot;grey rock sleet masquerading as a storm beneath a haze of &#x27;experimental&#x27; textures.&quot; Scott Seward of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; facetiously commended Reznor for &quot;once again ... pioneering the marriage of heavy guitars, moody atmospherics, electronic drones and beats, and aggressive singing. Just like Killing Joke 20 years ago.&quot; &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau was even less receptive: &quot;After six fucking years, genius-by-acclamation Trent Reznor delivers double-, every second remixed till it glistens like broken glass on a prison wall. Is the way he takes his petty pain out on the world a little, er, immature for a guy who&#x27;s pushing 35? Never mind, I&#x27;m told—just immerse in the music. So I do. &#x27;Dream job: emperor,&#x27; it says. &#x27;More fun than death by injection.&#x27;&quot;

&quot;The Fragile&quot; was included on several magazines&#x27; &quot;end-of-year&quot; album lists, including &quot;The Village Voice&quot; (number 14), &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; (number four), and &quot;Spin&quot; (number one). In a retrospective review, &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004) gave it three-and-a-half out of five stars and wrote that, as &quot;NIN&#x27;s monumental double-disc bid for the art-rock crown, &quot;The Fragile&quot; sounds fantastic from start to finish, but there aren&#x27;t enough memorable tunes underneath the alluring surfaces.&quot; AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine offered similar criticism, writing that &quot;Reznor&#x27;s music is immaculately crafted and arranged, with every note and nuance gliding into the next — but he spent more time constructing surfaces than songs. Those surfaces can be enticing but since it&#x27;s just surface, &quot;The Fragile&quot; winds up being vaguely unsatisfying.&quot; In 2005, &quot;The Fragile&quot; was ranked number 341 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. But, even if initial reception was mixed, the album has gotten a cult following from Nine Inch Nails fans. In 2016, &quot;Exclaim!&quot; listed &quot;The Fragile&quot; at number two on their &quot;Essential Albums&quot; list for Nine Inch Nails, citing it as their most ambitious work and &quot;a tragic if not stunning portrait of depression.&quot; &quot;Pitchfork&quot; would later reassess the album in their review of the album&#x27;s 2017 &quot;Definitive Edition&quot;, with a score change going from 2.0 to 8.7, describing it as Reznor&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus... &quot;The Fragile&quot; scrapes the sky like never before.&quot;

In &quot;Metal Hammer&quot;, it was named one of the 10 best industrial metal albums as well as one of the 20 best metal albums of 1999.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;The Fragile&quot; debuted atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first-week sales of 229,000 copies, earning the band their first number-one album on the chart. The album fell to number 16 the following week, becoming the largest drop from number one at the time. On January 4, 2000, the album was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and by May 2005, it had sold 898,000 copies in the United States.

Steven Hyden of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; writes that Reznor developed Nine Inch Nails from its role as a prominent rock act and by the time he finished recording &quot;The Fragile&quot;, alternative rock&#x27;s overall popularity declined with several of Nine Inch Nails&#x27; contemporaries being disestablished or displaced by newer bands. Hyden also attributes the album&#x27;s commercial performance to the rise of file-sharing on the Internet, which deviated from the alternative rock movement&#x27;s emphasis on &quot;fetishized vinyl&quot; and &quot;music festivals as peaceful places for young people to commune and dream of better futures.&quot;

===Cassette===
This release is identical to the CD pressing, with the exclusive addition of &quot;+Appendage&quot; attached to the end of &quot;Please&quot;.



===Vinyl / 2017 Definitive Edition===
This release of &quot;The Fragile&quot; contains the songs &quot;10 Miles High&quot; and &quot;The New Flesh&quot; (both of which were later released as part of the &quot;We&#x27;re in This Together&quot; and &quot;Into the Void&quot; singles, dependent on territory.) &quot;The Day the World Went Away&quot;, &quot;The Wretched&quot;, &quot;Even Deeper&quot; and &quot;La Mer&quot; are all extended mixes, while the opening and closing of each side eliminates the crossfading between songs found on the CD and cassette versions, due to the nature of the vinyl medium. Finally, &quot;Ripe&quot; was shortened by removing the conclusive &quot;(With Decay)&quot; portion of the song. All of these changes made for the vinyl carry over to the Definitive Edition pressings, released digitally in 2016 and on vinyl in 2017.





==&quot;The Fragile: Deviations 1&quot;==

&quot;The Fragile: Deviations 1&quot; is an alternate version of &quot;The Fragile&quot; that contains all of the original songs in either instrumental or alternate forms, and combines them with newly released tracks written and recorded during the sessions for &quot;The Fragile&quot;. &quot;Deviations 1&quot; consists of a one-off, limited edition four-LP pressing that was not made available on CD.

===Critical reception===
Neil Z. Yeung of AllMusic recommended that fans listen to and understand the original album first before delving into &quot;Deviations 1&quot;. Ultimately, he said that the release &quot;serves as both a sonic time capsule and a reminder of one of NIN&#x27;s most rewarding and underrated efforts.&quot; Writing for &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, Sean T. Collins found &quot;Deviations 1&quot; interesting but simultaneously perplexing, saying &quot;Far too many of &quot;Deviations&quot;&#x27; freshly vocal-free songs sound like karaoke versions rather than instrumentals that can stand on their own. The result is a listening experience that outstays its welcome on a song-by-song basis, let alone over the course of its massive 150-minute running time.&quot;

<doc id="227672" wikidata="Q17193" url="?curid=227672" title="Philippine peso">
<text>The Philippine peso, also referred to by its Filipino name piso ( , , plural pesos; ; sign: ₱; code: PHP), is the official currency of the Philippines. It is subdivided into 100 &quot;sentimo&quot;, also called centavos.

The peso has the symbol &quot;₱&quot;, introduced during American rule in place of the original peso sign &quot;$&quot; used throughout Spanish America. Alternative symbols used are &quot;PHP&quot;, &quot;PhP&quot;, &quot;Php&quot;, or just &quot;P&quot;.

The monetary policy of the Philippines is conducted by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), established on January 3, 1949, as its central bank. It produces the country&#x27;s banknotes and coins at its Security Plant Complex, which is set to move to New Clark City in Capas, Tarlac.

==History==

The Philippine peso is derived from the Spanish peso or pieces of eight brought over in large quantities from Spanish America by the Manila galleons of the period from the 16th century to the 19th. From the same Spanish peso or dollar is derived the various pesos of Spanish America, the dollars of the US and Hong Kong, as well as the Chinese yuan and the Japanese yen.

===Pre-colonial coinage===

Pre-colonial trade between tribes of what is now the Philippines and with traders from the neighboring islands was conducted through barter. The inconvenience of barter, however, later led to the use of some objects as a medium of exchange. Gold, which was plentiful in many parts of the islands, invariably found its way into these objects that included the Piloncitos, small bead-like gold bits considered by the local numismatists as the earliest coin of the ancient peoples of the Philippines, and gold barter rings. The original silver currency unit was the rupya or rupiah, brought over by trade with India and Indonesia.

Two native Tagalog words for money which survive today in Filipino were &quot;salapi&quot; and possibly &quot;pera&quot;. &quot;Salapi&quot; is thought to be from &quot;isa&quot; (one) + &quot;rupya&quot; which would become &quot;lapia&quot; when adapted to Tagalog. Alternately, it could be from Arabic &quot;asrafi&quot; (a gold coin, see Persian ashrafi) or &quot;sarf&quot; (money, money exchange). &quot;Pera&quot; is thought to be from Malay &quot;perak&quot; (silver), which also has a direct cognate or adaptation in Tagalog/Filipino as &quot;pilak&quot;. Alternately, it could be from 10 and 5 &quot;céntimo&quot; coins of the Spanish peseta, known as the &quot;perra gorda&quot; and &quot;perra chica&quot;.

===Spanish colonial period===


The Spanish dollar, or silver peso (worth eight reales), was first introduced by the Magellan expedition of 1521 and brought in large quantities after the 1565 conquest of the Philippines by Miguel López de Legazpi. The local salapi continued under Spanish rule as a toston or half-peso coin. Additionally, Spanish gold onzas or eight-escudo coins were also introduced with identical weight to the Spanish dollar but valued at 16 silver pesos.

The earliest silver coins brought in by the Manila galleons from Mexico and other Spanish American colonies were in the form of roughly-cut cobs or macuquinas. These coins usually bore a cross on one side and the Spanish royal coat-of-arms on the other. These crudely-made coins were subsequently replaced by machine-minted coins called Columnarios (pillar dollars) or &quot;dos mundos (two worlds)&quot; in 1732 containing 27.07 grams of 0.917 fine silver (revised to 0.903 fine in 1771).

Fractional currency was supplied by cutting the Spanish dollar coin, most commonly into eight wedges each worth one Spanish real. Locally produced crude copper or bronze coins called cuartos or barrillas (hence the Tagalog/Filipino words &quot;cuarta&quot; or &quot;kwarta&quot;, &quot;money&quot; and &quot;barya&quot; &quot;coin&quot; or &quot;loose change&quot;) were also struck in the Philippines by order of the Spanish government, with 20 cuartos being equal to one real (hence, 160 cuartos to a peso). The absence of officially minted cuartos in the 19th century was alleviated in part by counterfeit two-cuarto coins made by Igorot copper miners in the Cordilleras.

A currency system derived from coins imported from Spain, China and neighboring countries was fraught with various difficulties. Money came in different coinages, and fractional currency in addition to the real and the cuarto also existed. Money has nearly always been scarce in Manila, and when it was abundant it was shipped to the provinces or exported abroad to pay for exports. An 1857 decree requiring the keeping of accounts in pesos and céntimos (worth of a peso) was of little help to the situation given the existence of copper cuartos worth of a peso.

===19th century Gold/Silver Bimetallic standard===

The Spanish gold onza (or 8-escudo coin) was of identical weight to the Spanish dollar but was officially valued at 16 silver pesos, thus putting the peso on a bimetallic standard, worth either the silver Mexican peso (27.07 g 0.903 fine, or 0.786 troy ounce XAG) or the gold onza (1.6915 g 0.875 fine, or 0.0476 troy ounce XAU), with a gold–silver ratio of 16. Its divergence with the value of gold in international trade featured prominently in the continued monetary crises of the 19th century. In the 1850s the low price of gold in the international markets triggered the outflow of silver coins. In 1875 the adoption of the gold standard in Europe triggered a rise in the international price of gold and the replacement of gold coins with silver Mexican pesos.

As the price of silver fell further, Mexican peso imports were forbidden from 1877, and only Mexican pesos dated 1877 or earlier were legally equivalent to Philippine-minted pesos and &quot;peso fuerte&quot; banknotes. However, Spain and its colonies failed to establish a proper gold standard. The Philippine peso and the Spanish &quot;duro&quot; (Spain&#x27;s &quot;peso&quot; or five-peseta coin) thus went on a &quot;fiduciary coin&quot; (or fiat coin) standard; while worth more than the Mexican peso due to its scarcity in circulation, both coins traded at a fluctuating discount versus the gold peso. While pre-1877 Mexican pesos were reminted into Philippine 10-, 20- and 50-céntimo coins until the 1890s, these coins were continuously smuggled in connivance with Customs officials due to their higher fiat value in the Philippines.

After 1898 the United States colonial administration repealed this &quot;fictitious gold standard&quot; in favor of the unlimited importation of Mexican pesos, and the Philippine peso became a silver standard currency with its value dropping to half a gold peso.

Concurrent with these events is the establishment of the Casa de Moneda de Manila in the Philippines in 1857, the mintage starting 1861 of gold 1, 2 and 4 peso coins according to Spanish standards (the 4-peso coin being 6.766 grams of 0.875 gold), and the mintage starting 1864 of fractional 50-, 20- and 10-céntimo silver coins also according to Spanish standards (with 100 céntimos containing 25.96 grams of 0.900 silver; later lowered to 0.835 silver in 1881).

In 1897 Spain introduced 1-peso silver coins with the bust of King Alfonso XIII, as well as 5- and 10-&quot;céntimo de peseta&quot; coins for circulation in the Philippines as 1- and 2-&quot;céntimo de peso&quot; coins. The Spanish-Filipino peso remained in circulation and were legal tender in the islands until 1904, when the American authorities demonetized them in favor of the new US-Philippine peso.

The first paper money circulated in the Philippines was the Philippine peso fuerte issued in 1851 by the country&#x27;s first bank, the El Banco Español Filipino de Isabel II. Convertible to either silver pesos or gold onzas, its volume of 1,800,000 pesos was small relative to about 40,000,000 silver pesos in circulation at the end of the 19th century.

A fanciful etymology for the term &quot;pera&quot; holds that it was inspired by the Carlist Wars where Queen Isabel II was supposedly called &quot;La Perra&quot; (The Bitch) by her detractors, and thus coins bearing the image of Isabel II were supposedly called &quot;perras&quot;, which became &quot;pera&quot;. A less outlandish Spanish origin, if the term is indeed derived from Spanish, could be the Spanish coins of 10 and 5 &quot;céntimos de peseta&quot; (valued locally at 2 and 1 &quot;céntimos de peso&quot;) which were nicknamed &quot;perra gorda&quot; and &quot;perra chica&quot;, where the &quot;bitch&quot; or female dog is a sarcastic reference to the Spanish lion. Arguments against either theory are that the coins bearing the face of Isabel II were nicknamed &quot;Isabelinas&quot; and that the &quot;perra&quot; coins were only introduced to the Philippines in 1897.

===Revolutionary Period===
Asserting its independence after the Philippine Declaration of Independence on June 12, 1898, the &quot;República Filipina&quot; (Philippine Republic) under General Emilio Aguinaldo issued its own coins and paper currency backed by the country&#x27;s natural resources. The coins were the first to use the name &quot;centavo&quot; instead of &quot;céntimo&quot; for the subdivision of the peso. The island of Panay also issued revolutionary coinage. After Aguinaldo&#x27;s capture by American forces in Palanan, Isabela on March 23, 1901, the revolutionary peso ceased to exist.

===American Colonial Period===
After the United States took control of the Philippines, the United States Congress passed the Philippine Coinage Act of 1903, established the unit of currency to be a theoretical gold peso (not coined) consisting of 12.9 grains of gold 0.900 fine (0.0241875 XAU). This unit was equivalent to exactly half the value of a U.S. dollar. Its peg to gold was maintained until the gold content of the U.S. dollar was reduced in 1934. Its peg of ₱2 to the U.S. dollar was maintained until independence in 1946.

The act provided for the coinage and issuance of Philippine silver pesos substantially of the weight and fineness as the Mexican peso, which should be of the value of 50 cents gold and redeemable in gold at the insular treasury, and which was intended to be the sole circulating medium among the people. The act also provided for the coinage of subsidiary and minor coins and for the issuance of silver certificates in denominations of not less than 2 nor more than 10 pesos (maximum denomination increased to 500 pesos from 1905).

It also provided for the creation of a gold-standard fund to maintain the parity of the coins so authorized to be issued and authorized the insular government to issue temporary certificates of indebtedness bearing interest at a rate not to exceed 4 percent per annum, payable not more than one year from date of issue, to an amount which should not at any one time exceed 10 million dollars or 20 million pesos.

The US territorial administration also issued Culion leper colony coinage between 1913 and 1930.

===Commonwealth Period===

When the Philippines became a U.S. Commonwealth in 1935, the coat of arms of the Philippine Commonwealth was adopted and replaced the arms of the U.S. Territories on the reverse of coins while the obverse remained unchanged. This seal is composed of a much smaller eagle with its wings pointed up, perched over a shield with peaked corners, above a scroll reading &quot;Commonwealth of the Philippines&quot;. It is a much busier pattern, and widely considered less attractive.

===World War II===

In 1942, at the height of the resistance against the Japanese invasion in Corregidor island, US-Philippine forces managed to ship off to Australia most of the gold and significant assets held in reserve by Manila&#x27;s banks, but they had to discard an estimated ₱ 15 million worth of silver pesos into the sea off Caballo Bay rather than surrender it to the Japanese. After the war these assets would be returned to Philippine banks, and most of the discarded pesos would be recovered but in badly corroded condition.

The Japanese occupiers of the Philippines then introduced fiat notes for use in the country. Emergency circulating notes (also termed &quot;guerrilla pesos&quot;) were also issued by banks and local governments, using crude inks and materials, which were redeemable in silver pesos after the end of the war. The puppet state under José P. Laurel outlawed possession of guerrilla currency and declared a monopoly on the issuance of money and anyone found to possess guerrilla notes could be arrested or even executed. Because of the fiat nature of the currency, the Philippine economy felt the effects of hyperinflation.

Combined U.S. and Philippine Commonwealth military forces including recognized guerrilla units continued printing Philippine pesos, so that, from October 1944 to September 1945, all earlier issues except for the emergency guerrilla notes were considered illegal and were no longer legal tender.

=== Independence and the Central Bank of the Philippines, 1949–1993 ===
Republic Act No. 265 created the Central Bank of the Philippines (now the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas) on January 3, 1949, in which was vested the power of administering the banking and credit system of the country. Under the act, all powers in the printing and mintage of Philippine currency were vested in the CBP, taking away the rights of the banks such as Bank of the Philippine Islands and the Philippine National Bank to issue currency.

The Philippines faced various post-war problems due to the slow recovery of agricultural production, trade deficits due to the need to import needed goods, and high inflation due to the lack of goods. The CBP embarked on a fixed exchange system during the 1950s in which the peso&#x27;s official exchange rate was maintained at ₱2 per U.S. dollar by various measures to control and conserve the country&#x27;s international reserves.

This system, combined with other &quot;Filipino First&quot; efforts to curtail importations, helped reshape the country&#x27;s import patterns and improve the balance of payments. Such restrictions, however, gave rise to a black market in which dollars routinely traded at above ₱3 per dollar. The CBP&#x27;s allocation system which rationed a limited supply of dollars at ₱2 per dollar to purchase priority imports was exploited by parties with political connections. Higher black market exchange rates drove remittances and foreign investments away from official channels.

By 1962, the task of maintaining the old ₱2 per dollar parity while defending available reserves had become untenable under the new Diosdado Macapagal administration, opening up a new &quot;decontrol era&quot; from 1962 to 1970 in which foreign exchange restrictions were dismantled and a new free-market exchange rate of ₱3.90 per dollar was adopted from 1965. This move helped balance foreign exchange supply versus demand and greatly boosted foreign investment inflows and international reserves. However, a weak manufacturing base that could not capture market share in (mostly imported) consumer goods meant that devaluation only fueled inflation, and by the time the decontrol era ended in 1970 another devaluation to ₱6.43 per dollar was needed.

In 1967, coinage adopted Filipino language terminology instead of English, banknotes following suit in 1969. Thus the currency names appearing on coinage and banknotes changed from the English &quot;centavo&quot; and &quot;peso&quot; to the Filipino &quot;sentimo&quot; and &quot;piso&quot;. However, &quot;centavo&quot; is more commonly used by Filipinos in everyday speech.

The CBP&#x27;s final era from 1970 until the BSP&#x27;s reestablishment in 1993 involved a &quot;managed float system&quot; with no more fixed parity commitments versus the dollar. The CBP only committed to maintain orderly foreign exchange market conditions and to reduce short-term volatility. Difficulties continued throughout the 1970s and 1980s in managing inflation and keeping exchange rates stable, and this was complicated further by the CBP lacking independence in government, especially when the latter incurred fiscal shortfalls. The worst episode occurred when a confidence crisis in the Ferdinand Marcos administration triggered a capital flight among investors between August 1983 and February 1986, nearly doubling the exchange rate from ₱11 to ₱20 per dollar and also doubling the prices of goods.

=== Reorganization to the new Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas ===
Positive political and economic developments in the 1990s paved the way for further economic liberalization and an opportunity to unburden the central bank of objectives that are inconsistent with keeping inflation stable. The New Central Bank Act (Republic Act No 7653) of June 14, 1993 replaces the old CBP with a new Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas mandated explicitly to maintain price stability, and enjoying fiscal and administrative autonomy to insulate it from government interference. This, along with the further liberalization of various foreign exchange regulations, puts the Philippine peso on a fully floating exchange rate system. The market decides on the level in which the peso trades versus foreign currencies based on the BSP&#x27;s ability to maintain a stable inflation rate on goods and services as well as sufficient international reserves to fund exports. Black market exchange rates as seen in the past are now nonexistent since official markets now reflect underlying supply and demand.

The Philippine peso has since traded versus the U.S. dollar in a range of ₱24–46 from 1993 to 1999, ₱40–56 from 2000 to 2009, and ₱40–54 from 2010 to 2019. The previous 1903–1934 definition of a peso as 12.9 grains of 0.9 gold (or 0.0241875 XAU) is now worth ₱2,266.03 based on gold prices as of November 2021.

==Names for different denominations==
The smallest currency unit is called centavo in English (from Spanish &quot;centavo&quot;). Following the adoption of the &quot;Pilipino series&quot; in 1967, it became officially known as &quot;sentimo&quot; in Filipino (from Spanish &quot;céntimo&quot;). However, &quot;centavo&quot; and its local spellings, &quot;síntabo&quot; and &quot;sentabo&quot;, are still used as synonyms in Tagalog. It is the most widespread preferred term over &quot;sentimo&quot; in other Philippine languages, including Abaknon, Bikol, Cebuano, Cuyonon, Ilocano, and Waray, In Chavacano, centavos are referred to as &quot;céns&quot; (also spelled &quot;séns&quot;).

Tagalog language words for the different centavo-denominated coins were more common in the 20th century before the decrease in their use afterwards.
* The half-centavo coin was called a &quot;kusing&quot;, and the 1-centavo coin was called &quot;isang pera&quot; or &quot;sampera&quot;.
* Coins for 5, 10, 25 and 50 centavos went by their Spanish names &quot;singko&quot;, &quot;diyes&quot;, &quot;bentesingko&quot; and &quot;singkwenta&quot;. Additionally, the 50-centavo coin was also called &quot;salapi&quot;.
* The terms &quot;1 peso each&quot;, &quot;50 centavos each&quot; and &quot;1 centavo each&quot; may be expressed as &quot;mamiso&quot;, &quot;manalapi&quot; and &quot;mamera&quot;, respectively.

==Coins==

The Spanish administration opened the &quot;Casa de Moneda de Manila&quot; (or Manila mint) in 1857 in order to supply coins for the Philippines, minting silver coins of 10 céntimos, 20 céntimos, and 50 céntimos; and gold coins of 1 peso, 2 pesos and 4 pesos.

The American government minted currency under the Philippine Coinage Act of 1903 in its mints in the United States, in base-metal denominations of half centavo, one centavo and five centavos; and in silver denominations of 10 centavos, 20 centavos, 50 centavos and 1 peso. They eventually deemed it more economical and convenient to mint coins in the Philippines, hence the re-opening of the Manila Mint in 1920, which produced coins until the Commonwealth Era excluding centavo and regular-issue 1-peso coins (commemorative 1-peso coins were minted in 1936).

In 1937, the eagle-and-shield reverse design was changed into the coat-of-arms of the Commonwealth of the Philippines while retaining the legend &quot;United States of America&quot;. During the Second World War, no coins were minted from 1942 to 1943 due to the Japanese Occupation. Minting resumed in 1944–45 for the last time under the Commonwealth. Coins only resumed in 1958 after an issuance of centavo-denominated fractional banknotes from 1949 to 1957.
In 1958, the new English coinage series entirely of base metal was introduced, consisting of bronze 1 centavo, brass 5 centavos and nickel-brass 10 centavos, 25 centavos and 50 centavos. The 20-centavo denomination was discontinued.
In 1967, the Pilipino-language coin series was introduced with the peso and centavo renamed into &quot;piso&quot; and &quot;sentimo&quot;. It consisted of aluminum 1-sentimo, brass 5-sentimo, and nickel-brass 10, 25 and 50 sentimo. The 1-piso coin was reintroduced in 1972.

In 1975, the Ang Bagong Lipunan Series was introduced. It consisted of aluminum 1-sentimo, brass 5-sentimo, cupro-nickel 10-sentimo, 25-sentimo and 1-piso, and a pure nickel 5-piso coin which rarely circulated.
In 1983, the Flora and Fauna Series was introduced. It consisted of aluminum 1, 5 and 10-sentimo, brass 25-sentimo, and cupro-nickel 50-sentimo, 1-piso and a new 2-piso coin. From 1991 to 1994 the sizes of coins from 25-sentimo to 2-piso were reduced under the Improved Flora and Fauna Series, and a new nickel-brass 5-piso coin was introduced.

In 1995, the New Design coin series was introduced with the aim of replacing and demonetizing all previously issued coin series on January 3, 1998. It initially consisted of copper-plated steel 1, 5 and 10-sentimo, brass 25-sentimo, copper-nickel 1-piso and nickel-brass 5-piso. In 2000, the bimetallic 10-piso coin was added to the series. In 2003, the composition of the 25-sentimo and 1-piso was changed to brass-plated steel and nickel-plated steel, respectively.

The current series, the New Generation Currency Series was introduced in 2017, consisting of nickel-plated steel 1, 5 ,25 sentimo and 1, 5 and 10-piso. In December 2019, the bimetallic plated-steel 20-piso coin was introduced, together with a modified nine-sided 5-piso coin issued in response to numerous complaints that the round steel 5-piso coin looked too much like the 1-piso and 10-piso.

Denominations worth P0.25 (~$0.005) and below are still issued but have been increasingly regarded as a nuisance. Proposals to retire and demonetize all coins less than one peso in value have been rejected by the government and the BSP.

==Banknotes==


===Previous series===
In 1852, the Philippines first issued banknotes under &quot;El Banco Español Filipino de Isabel II&quot; (the present Bank of the Philippine Islands) in denominations of 10, 25, 50 and 200 &quot;pesos fuertes&quot; (strong pesos).

By 1903, the American colonial Insular Government issued Silver Certificates in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 500 pesos, backed by silver coin or U.S. gold at a fixed rate of 2:1. These were supplemented by banknotes of the Bank of the Philippine Islands in 1908, banknotes of the Philippine National Bank in 1916, and Treasury Certificates of the Philippine Treasury in 1918 backed by United States Government bonds. Only the latter remained legal tender after Philippine independence in 1946.

The dimensions of all banknotes issued under the US-Philippine administration, 16 x 6.6 cm, has been used ever since on all Philippine banknotes (except pre-1958 centavo notes), and was introduced during William Howard Taft&#x27;s tenure as governor-general of the Philippines. In view of its highly successful run, President Taft then appointed a committee that reported favorably on the advantages and savings from changing the size of United States banknotes to Philippine-size.

Since 1928 the sizes of the U.S. dollar Federal Reserve Notes and Philippine banknotes have therefore been nearly identical.

In 1949, the Central Bank of the Philippines took over paper money issue. Its first notes were Treasury Certificates printed under US administration overprinted with &quot;Victory - Central Bank of the Philippines&quot;. These were followed in 1951 by regular-issue English Series banknotes in denominations of 5, 10, 20 and 50 centavos, 1 peso, 2 pesos, 5 pesos, 10 pesos, 20 pesos, 50 pesos, 100 pesos, 200 pesos and 500 pesos. The centavo notes (except for the 50-centavo note, which would be later known as the half-peso note) were discontinued in 1958 when the English Series coins were first minted.

In 1967, the CBP adopted the Filipino language on its Pilipino Banknote Series, using the name Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, and in 1969 introduced the Pilipino Series of notes in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 piso. The Ang Bagong Lipunan Series was introduced in 1973 and included 2-piso notes.

A radical change occurred in 1985, when the CBP issued the New Design Series with 500-piso notes introduced in 1987, 1000-piso notes (for the first time) in 1991 and 200-piso notes in 2002.

The New Design Series was the name used to refer to Philippine banknotes issued from 1985 to 1993. It was then renamed as the BSP Series due to the re-establishment of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas in 1993. It was succeeded by the New Generation Currency Series conceptualized from 2007 to 2010 and issued since December 16, 2010.

The New Design/BSP Series banknotes were printed until 2013 (with 5-peso note were printed until 1995, 10-peso note until 2001, 20 and 1000 peso notes until 2012, and 50, 100, 200 and 500 peso notes until 2013), legal tender until December 31, 2015, and can be exchanged with newer notes until the main banknotes&#x27; demonetization on January 3, 2018. The NDS co-existed with NGC banknotes throughout the 2010s decade from December 16, 2010, to August 2, 2019. The main banknotes were no longer legal tender since January 1, 2016 and they were demonetized two years later on January 3, 2018, and the series overall on August 2, 2019 with the 2,000 and 100,000 peso commemorative banknotes, making the NDS/BSP series the longest banknote series to have a liability of the BSP at 34 years.

===New Generation Currency (current)===

Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) began the 12-year demonetization process of the New Design Series when the New Generation Currency (NGC) project was started in 2007 through formal conceptualization process which was a result of the meeting of the minds of people with diverse backgrounds and ideas: central bankers, artists, technocrats, historians, communication experts, and currency printers to further enhance security features and to improve durability. It is where the thematic content, designs, and security features underwent thorough deliberations and evaluation, and was undertaken by the BSP’s Numismatic Committee (Num Com) in consultation with the Monetary Board (MB) and, subsequently, with the approval of the BSP Governor and the President of the Philippines.

The members of the numismatic committee included Bangko Sentral Deputy Governor Diwa Guinigundo and Dr. Ambeth Ocampo, chairman of the National Historical Institute. Designed by Studio 5 Designs and Design Systemat, the new banknotes&#x27; designs features famous Filipinos and iconic natural wonders. Philippine national symbols will be depicted on coins. The BSP started releasing the initial batch of new banknotes and design to the public in December 16, 2010 three years after the project and process for NDS demonetization were started. The word used in the bills was &quot;Pilipino&quot; rendered in Baybayin (). The font used for lettering in the banknotes is Myriad, while the numerals are set in the Twentieth Century font. The series was approved by Presidents Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and her immediate successor Benigno Aquino III, making the only banknote series to be approved by two presidents.

Several, albeit disputable, errors have been discovered on banknotes of the New Generation series and discussed in social media. Among these are the exclusion of Batanes from the Philippine map on the reverse of all denominations, the mislocation of the Puerto Princesa Subterranean Underground River on the reverse of the 500-peso note and the Tubbataha Reef on the 1000-peso note, and the incorrect coloring on the beak and feathers of the blue-naped parrot on the 500-peso, but these were eventually realized to be due to the color limitations of intaglio printing. The scientific names of the animals featured on the reverse sides of all banknotes were incorrectly rendered in the 2010 series, but were corrected starting 2017.

By February 2016, the BSP started to circulate new 100-peso notes which were modified to have a stronger mauve or violet color. This was &quot;in response to suggestions from the public to make it easier to distinguish from the 1000-peso bank note&quot;. The public can still use the New Generation Currency 100-peso notes with fainter colors as they are still acceptable.

In 2019, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) introduced a 20-piso coin that will eventually replace the 20-piso note. The latter remained in production until its printing materials were used up; it will remain legal tender, disappearing gradually as individual notes become unfit for circulation.

===Original series===
===Enhanced (2020) series===
=== First Philippine Polymer Banknote ===
=== Commemorative banknotes ===
Commemorative banknotes have been issued by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas to memorialize events of historic significance to the Philippines.
The most common method of commemoration is by adding a commemorative overprint on the watermark area of a circulating denomination. There also exist especially printed commemorative higher-denomination non-circulating banknotes, in the following denominations:
* 2,000-piso: Centennial of Declaration of Philippine Independence, 1998
* 100,000-piso: Centennial of Declaration of Philippine Independence, 1998
* 5,000-piso: 2021 Quincentennial Commemorations in the Philippines

==Monetary policy==
The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) was established on July 3, 1993, as the Philippines&#x27; central bank, succeeding the previous Central Bank of the Philippines which was established in 1949. Its primary monetary policy objective is &quot;to promote a low and stable inflation conducive to a balanced and sustainable economic growth.&quot; 
It achieves this objective through &quot;inflation targeting&quot;, a monetary policy approach where an inflation target is publicly announced, which the BSP then commits to achieve over a two-year horizon by using these monetary policy tools:
* Adjusting the policy rate at which the BSP borrows from banks;
* Open Market Operations where the BSP buys (or sells) government securities and BSP securities in order to increase (or decrease) liquidity;
* Offering term deposits to absorb liquidity;
* Standing Liquidity Facilities to provide liquidity to banks as needed; and
* Increasing (or decreasing) bank reserve requirements to decrease (or increase) remaining liquidity that can be loaned out.

Inflation forecasts exceeding targets are addressed by a &quot;contractionary policy&quot; to bring down inflation to target by increasing policy rates, increasing reserve requirements, or selling government securities - all resulting in reduced liquidity. An &quot;expansionary policy&quot; to counteract low inflation brought by economic pessimism involves the opposite steps - lower policy rates, lower reserve requirements, or buying government securities.

==Exchange rates==

===Historical exchange rate===
The official exchange rate was ₱2 against the U.S. dollar from 1946 to 1962, devalued to ₱3.90 in 1962, and devalued again to ₱6.43 in 1970. Black market exchange rates during these periods, however, were nearly always higher than official rates.

Several depreciations followed:
* The peso traded at ₱18 per dollar in 1984 from the dirty float at ₱11.25 in 1983 and ₱21 in 1986.
* In the early 1990s, the peso depreciated again to ₱29 before appreciating to ₱23-₱26 in the middle of the decade.
* Due to the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the peso depreciated from ₱26 in July 1997 to ₱45 in 1998 and to about ₱50 in 2001 before appreciating to ₱41 in 2007.
* In the 2010s, it appreciated to ₱40 in 2012, before depreciating to ₱54/$ in 2018.
* Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the peso appreciated as much as ₱47 in 2021. In 2022, the peso depreciated to its all-time low of ₱59 per dollar, likely as a result of the economic impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Black market exchange rates as seen in the past are now nonexistent, since official exchange rates now reflect underlying supply and demand rather than political considerations.

===Current exchange rate===
==Recent issues==
===Errors in currency===
In 2005, about 78 million 100-peso notes with President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo&#x27;s surname misspelled as &quot;Arrovo&quot; were printed and planned to be circulated. The error was only found out after 2 million of the notes had been circulated, and the BSP ordered an investigation.

The incorrect manner in which scientific names were printed in the 2010 New Generation Currency Series was addressed in 2017 revisions.

In December 2017, a 100 peso banknote which had no face of Manuel A. Roxas and no electrotype 100 was issued. The Facebook post was shared over 24,000 times. The BSP said that the banknotes are due to a rare misprint.

===1-peso coin fraud===
By August 2006, it became publicly known that the 1-peso coin has the same size as the 1 United Arab Emirates dirham coin. , 1 peso is only worth 0.08 dirhams, leading to vending machine fraud in the UAE.

===Fake denominations===
In 2017, a one-peso coin that was allegedly minted in 1971 was said to bear the design of the novel Noli Me Tángere by Jose Rizal on the reverse. The coin was allegedly sold for up to ₱1,000,000. The holder of the coin was interviewed by &quot;Kapuso Mo, Jessica Soho&quot; about this, but potential buyers made no serious offers to purchase the coin, and the BSP said that it did not release any coin of the said design. The BSP also mentioned that the coin is thinner than the circulating coin, which suggests that someone might have tampered with it and replaced it with a different design.

In June 2018, a Facebook page posted a ₱10,000 note with a portrait of President Ramon Magsaysay on the front and a water buffalo and Mount Pinatubo on the back. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas did not issue this banknote and stressed that only 6 denominations were in current circulation (20, 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1,000 pesos). The Facebook page of the BSP said that it was fake. The signature was also of former governor of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Amando Tetangco Jr. It was found out that the photo was from a different user who found a fake 10,000 peso banknote in a book at a library.

===Rumour about folded banknotes===
In July 2022, a Facebook user posted a ₱1,000 banknote (polymer variant) that is slightly folded, and complained that SM Supermalls rejected it as it was folded. The user warned the public to not fold their ₱1,000 polymer banknotes. SM Supermalls in Facebook and the BSP later stated officially that folded polymer notes are accepted.

<text>In the field of sociology, charismatic authority is a concept of organizational leadership wherein the authority of the leader derives from the personal charisma of the leader. In the tripartite classification of authority, the sociologist Max Weber contrasts charismatic authority (character, heroism, leadership, religious) against two other types of authority: (i) rational-legal authority (modern law, the sovereign state, bureaucracy) and (ii) traditional authority (patriarchy, patrimonialism, feudalism).

The Ancient Greek word became known through the Pauline epistles to Christian communities in the first century of the Common Era, wherein the word &quot;charisma&quot; denoted and described a &quot;gift&quot; of divine origin that demonstrated the divine authority possessed by the early leaders of the Church. Weber developed the theological term and the concept of &quot;charisma&quot; into a secular term for the sociological study of organizations. Terms derived from &quot;charisma&quot; include &quot;charismatic domination&quot; and &quot;charismatic leadership&quot;.

== Characteristics ==

===Charisma===
Weber applies the term &quot;charisma&quot; to

 In the modern era, some psychologists have defined charisma in terms of practical outcomes (i.e. charismatic leaders are effective). However, such a definition results in circular in reasoning. The conclusions derived such definitions (and measures) cannot be refuted given that the proponents claim something akin to &quot;if effective, therefore charismatic&quot;. Charisma, however, can be studied scientifically if seen as a costly signal, using values, symbols, and emotions. It was shown to correlate strongly with general intelligence and observers infer that those signaling charisma are more competent. Its economic value in consequential settings has also been scientifically examined. Thus Weber&#x27;s insights were valuable in naming the construct of charisma, although his definitions and insights did not allow for its scientific study. Modern social science however, has found supports for the notion that charismatic leaders can, under certain conditions, be very persuasive.

===Authority===
Weber interchanges authority and dominance[H]as been considered in sociological terms as indicating the legitimate or socially approved use of power. It is the legitimate power which one person or a group holds and exercises over another. The element of legitimacy is vital to the notion of authority and is the main means by which authority is distinguished from the more general concept of power. Power can be exerted by the use of force or violence. Authority, by contrast, depends on the acceptance by subordinates of the right of those above them to give them orders or directives.
Charismatic authority is often the most lasting of regimes because the leader is seen as infallible and any action against him will be seen as a crime against the state. Charismatic leaders eventually develop a cult of personality often not by their own doing.

Leadership is the power to diffuse a positive energy and a sense of greatness. As such, it rests almost entirely on the leader. The absence of that leader for any reason can lead to the authority&#x27;s power dissolving. However, due to its idiosyncratic nature and lack of formal organization, charismatic authority depends much more strongly on the perceived legitimacy of the authority than Weber&#x27;s other forms of authority. For instance, a charismatic leader in a religious context might require an unchallenged belief that the leader has been touched by God, in the sense of a prophet. Should the strength of this belief fade, the power of the charismatic leader can fade quickly, which is one of the ways in which this form of authority shows itself to be unstable.

In contrast to the current popular use of the term &quot;charismatic leader&quot;, Weber saw charismatic authority not so much as character traits of the charismatic leader but as a relationship between the leader and his followers. The validity of charisma is founded on its &quot;recognition&quot; by the leader&#x27;s followers (or &quot;adepts&quot; – ).
His charisma risks disappearing if he is &quot;abandoned by God&quot; or if &quot;his government doesn&#x27;t provide any prosperity to those whom he dominates&quot;.

=== Routinizing charisma ===
Charismatic authority almost always endangers the boundaries set by traditional (coercive) or rational (legal) authority. It tends to challenge this authority, and is thus often seen as revolutionary. Usually this charismatic authority is incorporated into society. Hereby the challenge that it presents to society will subside. The way in which this happens is called &quot;routinization&quot;.

By routinization, the charismatic authority changes:
A religion which evolves its own priesthood and establishes a set of laws and rules is likely to lose its charismatic character and move towards another type of authority. For example, Muhammad, who had charismatic authority as &quot;The Prophet&quot; among his followers, was succeeded by the traditional authority and structure of Islam, a clear example of routinization.

In politics, charismatic rule is often found in various authoritarian states, autocracies, dictatorships and theocracies. To help to maintain their charismatic authority, such regimes will often establish a vast personality cult. When the leader of such a state dies or leaves office, and a new charismatic leader does not appear, such a regime is likely to fall shortly thereafter, unless it has become fully routinized.

==Charismatic succession==
Because the authority is concentrated in one leader, the death of the charismatic leader would constitute the destruction of the government unless prior arrangements were made. A society that faces the end of their charismatic leader can choose to move to another format of leadership or to have a transference of charismatic authority to another leader by means of succession.

According to Max Weber, the methods of succession are: search, revelation, designation by original leader, designation by qualified staff, hereditary charisma, and office charisma. These are the various ways in which an individual and a society can contrive to maintain the unique energy and nature of charisma in their leadership.

===Search===
&quot;The search for a new charismatic leader (takes place) on the basis of the qualities which will fit him for the position of authority.&quot; An example of this search method is the search for a new Dalai Lama. &quot;It consists in a search for a child with characteristics which are interpreted to mean that he is a reincarnation of the Buddha.&quot; This search is an example of the way in which an original charismatic leader can be forced to &quot;live on&quot; through a replacement.

===Revelation===
&quot;In this case the legitimacy of the new leader is dependent on the legitimacy of the technique of selection.&quot; The technique of selection is the &quot;modus operandi&quot; of the selection process. In ancient times, oracles were believed to have special access to &quot;divine judgment&quot; and thus their technique in selection was perceived to be legitimate. Their choice was imbued with the charismatic authority that came with the oracle&#x27;s endorsement.

===Designation by original leader===
In this form, the original holder of charismatic authority is perceived to have passed their authority to another. An example is Joseph Stalin&#x27;s claim that Vladimir Lenin had designated him to be his successor as leader of the USSR. Insofar as people believed in this claim, Stalin gained Lenin&#x27;s charismatic authority.

===Designated by qualified staff===
&quot;A successor (may be designated) by the charismatically qualified administrative staff... (T)his process should not be interpreted as &#x27;election&#x27; or &#x27;nomination&#x27;... It is not determined by merely a majority vote...Unanimity (is) often required.&quot; A case example of this form of succession is the papal conclave of cardinals to choose a new pope. The cardinals taking part in the papal conclave are viewed to be charismatically qualified by their Roman Catholic congregations and thus their choice is imbued with charismatic authority.

===Hereditary charisma===
Charisma can be perceived as &quot;a quality transmitted by heredity&quot;. This method of succession is present in Kim Il Sung&#x27;s charisma being passed on to his son, Kim Jong Il. This type of succession is a difficult undertaking and often results in a movement toward traditionalization and legalization in authority.

===Office charisma===
&quot;The concept of charisma may be transmitted by ritual means from one bearer to another...It involves a dissociation of charisma from a particular individual, making it an objective, transferable entity.&quot; Priestly consecration is believed to be a modus through which priestly charisma to teach and perform other priestly duties is transferred to a person. In this way, priests inherit priestly charisma and are subsequently perceived by their congregations as having the charismatic authority that comes with the priesthood.

==Application of Weber&#x27;s theories==
Weber&#x27;s model of charismatic leadership giving way to institutionalization is endorsed by several academic sociologists.

===New religious movements===
Eileen Barker discusses the tendency for new religious movements to have founders or leaders who wield considerable charismatic authority and are believed to have special powers or knowledge. Charismatic leaders are unpredictable, Barker says, for they are not bound by tradition or rules and they may be accorded by their followers the right to pronounce on all aspects of their lives. Barker warns that in these cases the leader may lack any accountability, require unquestioning obedience, and encourage a dependency upon the movement for material, spiritual and social resources.

George D. Chryssides asserts that not all new religious movements have charismatic leaders, and that there are differences in the hegemonic styles among those movements that do.

==Narcissism==
Len Oakes, an Australian psychologist who wrote a dissertation about charisma, had eleven charismatic leaders fill in a psychometric test, which he called the &quot;adjective checklist&quot;, and found them as a group quite ordinary. Following the psychoanalyst Heinz Kohut, Oakes argues that charismatic leaders exhibit traits of narcissism and also argues that they display an extraordinary amount of energy, accompanied by an inner clarity unhindered by the anxieties and guilt that afflict more ordinary people. He did, however, not fully follow Weber&#x27;s framework of charismatic authority.

<doc id="227675" wikidata="Q369429" url="?curid=227675" title="Vascular cambium">
<text>The vascular cambium is the main growth tissue in the stems and roots of many plants, specifically in dicots such as buttercups and oak trees, gymnosperms such as pine trees, as well as in certain other vascular plants. It produces secondary xylem inwards, towards the pith, and secondary phloem outwards, towards the bark.

In herbaceous plants, it occurs in the vascular bundles which are often arranged like beads on a necklace forming an interrupted ring inside the stem. In woody plants, it forms a cylinder of unspecialized meristem cells, as a continuous ring from which the new tissues are grown. Unlike the xylem and phloem, it does not transport water, minerals or food through the plant. Other names for the vascular cambium are the main cambium, wood cambium, or bifacial cambium.

== Occurrence ==
Vascular cambia are found in all seed plants except for five angiosperm lineages which have independently lost it; Nymphaeales, &quot;Ceratophyllum&quot;, &quot;Nelumbo&quot;, Podostemaceae, and monocots. In dicot and gymnosperm trees, the vascular cambium is the obvious line separating the bark and wood; they also have a cork cambium. For successful grafting, the vascular cambia of the rootstock and scion must be aligned so they can grow together.

== Structure and function ==

The cambium present between primary xylem and primary phloem is called the &quot;intrafascicular&quot; cambium (within vascular bundles). During secondary growth, cells of medullary rays, in a line (as seen in section; in three dimensions, it is a sheet) between neighbouring vascular bundles, become meristematic and form new &quot;interfascicular&quot; cambium (between vascular bundles). The fascicular and interfascicular cambia thus join up to form a ring (in three dimensions, a tube) which separates the primary xylem and primary phloem, the &quot;cambium ring&quot;. The vascular cambium produces secondary xylem on the inside of the ring, and secondary phloem on the outside, pushing the primary xylem and phloem apart.

The vascular cambium usually consists of two types of cells:
* Fusiform initials (tall, axially oriented)
* Ray initials (smaller and round to angular in shape)

=== Maintenance of cambial meristem ===

The vascular cambium is maintained by a network of interacting signal feedback loops. Currently, both hormones and short peptides have been identified as information carriers in these systems. While similar regulation occurs in other plant meristems, the cambial meristem receives signals from both the xylem and phloem sides for the meristem. Signals received from outside the meristem act to down regulate internal factors, which promotes cell proliferation and differentiation.

===Hormonal regulation===

The phytohormones that are involved in the vascular cambial activity are auxins, ethylene, gibberellins, cytokinins, abscisic acid and probably more to be discovered. Each one of these plant hormones is vital for regulation of cambial activity. Combination of different concentrations of these hormones is very important in plant metabolism.

Auxin hormones are proven to stimulate mitosis, cell production and regulate interfascicular and fascicular cambium. Applying auxin to the surface of a tree stump allowed decapitated shoots to continue secondary growth. The absence of auxin hormones will have a detrimental effect on a plant. It has been shown that mutants without auxin will exhibit increased spacing between the interfascicular cambiums and reduced growth of the vascular bundles. The mutant plant will therefore experience a decrease in water, nutrients, and photosynthates being transported throughout the plant, eventually leading to death. Auxin also regulates the two types of cell in the vascular cambium, ray and fusiform initials. Regulation of these initials ensures the connection and communication between xylem and phloem is maintained for the translocation of nourishment and sugars are safely being stored as an energy resource. Ethylene levels are high in plants with an active cambial zone and are still currently being studied. Gibberellin stimulates the cambial cell division and also regulates differentiation of the xylem tissues, with no effect on the rate of phloem differentiation. Differentiation is an essential process that changes these tissues into a more specialized type, leading to an important role in maintaining the life form of a plant. In poplar trees, high concentrations of gibberellin is positively correlated to an increase of cambial cell division and an increase of auxin in the cambial stem cells. Gibberellin is also responsible for the expansion of xylem through a signal traveling from the shoot to the root. Cytokinin hormone is known to regulate the rate of the cell division instead of the direction of cell differentiation. A study demonstrated that the mutants are found to have a reduction in stem and root growth but the secondary vascular pattern of the vascular bundles were not affected with a treatment of cytokinin.

== Cambium as food ==

The cambium of most trees are edible. In Scandinavia, it was historically used as a flour to make bark bread.

<text>Cork cambium (: cambia or cambiums) is a tissue found in many vascular plants as a part of the epidermis. It is one of the many layers of bark, between the cork and primary phloem. The cork cambium is a lateral meristem and is responsible for secondary growth that replaces the epidermis in roots and stems. It is found in woody and many herbaceous dicots, gymnosperms and some monocots (monocots usually lack secondary growth). It is one of the plant&#x27;s meristems – the series of tissues consisting of embryonic disk (incompletely differentiated) cells from which the plant grows. The function of cork cambium is to produce the cork, a tough protective material.

Synonyms for cork cambium are bark cambium, peri-cambium and phellogen. Phellogen is defined as the meristematic cell layer responsible for the development of the periderm. Cells that grow inwards from there are termed &quot;phelloderm&quot;, and cells that develop outwards are termed &quot;phellem&quot; or cork (note similarity with vascular cambium). The periderm thus consists of three different layers:
* phelloderm – inside of cork cambium; composed of living parenchyma cells.
* phellogen (cork cambium) – meristem that gives rise to periderm. 
* phellem (cork) – dead at maturity; air-filled, quite variable between different species, and is also highly dependent on age and growth conditions as can be observed from the different surfaces of bark, which may be smooth, fissured, tesselated, scaly, or flaking off.

== Economic importance ==
Commercial cork is derived from the bark of the cork oak &quot;(Quercus suber).&quot; Cork has many uses including wine bottle stoppers, bulletin boards, coasters, hot pads to protect tables from hot pans, insulation, sealing for lids, flooring, gaskets for engines, fishing bobbers, handles for fishing rods and tennis rackets, etc. It is also a high strength-to-weight/cost ablative material for aerodynamic prototypes in wind tunnels, as well as satellite launch vehicle payload fairings, reentry surfaces, and compression joints in thrust-vectored solid rocket motor nozzles.

Many types of bark are used as mulch.

<doc id="227680" wikidata="Q1142127" url="?curid=227680" title="Osaka Loop Line">
<text>The is a railway loop line in Japan operated by the West Japan Railway Company (JR West). It encircles central Osaka.

Part of a second, outer loop line, the Osaka Higashi Line, from Hanaten to Kyuhoji was opened on March 15, 2008, and the line from Shigino to Shin-Ōsaka opened in March 2019. This entry covers the original central loop line.

==Outline==
The loop line consists of two tracks around the heart of metropolitan Osaka. All train services consist of eight cars, with distinctive orange color with white JR graphics on the front, rear and sides. The train schedule varies, but on average, two trains leave Tennōji Station and Ōsaka Station every five minutes, in opposite directions.

==Operation==
On this line, JR West operates several types of trains. The line serves as a link between Ōsaka Station in northern Osaka (actually the Umeda district), and Tennōji in southern central Osaka. Some Limited Express trains linking north and south of the Osaka–Kobe–Kyoto area use the line as a bypass between the Tōkaidō Main Line in the north and the Hanwa Line in the south. Traffic is heavier in the eastern half, Osaka–Kyōbashi–Tennōji, than in the western half via Nishi-Kujō.

===Direction===
The completely loop shaped Osaka Loop Line is unable to use the and rail direction convention usually applied to JR lines. Instead, the words and the are used to refer to the direction of the train, similar to the Yamanote line in Tokyo.

For purposes of rail registration of the line at the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, the inner loop is considered &quot;down&quot;.

===Local===
Local trains are operated all day. Some operate over the complete loop, while some serve the eastern half between Osaka and Tennōji via Kyōbashi.

Eight-car EMUs of 323 series are used. 221 series, 223 series and 225 series are used only for morning rush.

===Sakurajima Line trains===
Trains of the Sakurajima Line (JR Yumesaki Line) are now operated through to the loop line to/from Kyōbashi and Tennoji.

Eight-car 323 series EMUs are used.

===Rapids of Kansai Main Line===
Through trains to the Kansai Main Line (Yamatoji Line) began operated in 1973. and trains originate at Tennōji on the loop, passing the loop as &quot;inner&quot; via Osaka, and after stopping at Tennōji after a complete circuit, exit the loop onto the Kansai Main Line and terminate at , or . In the loop, Yamatoji Rapids pass some stations while Regional Rapids stop all.

For &quot;Yamatoji Rapid&quot; and &quot;Regional Rapid&quot;, usually 8-car and 4+4 car 221 series EMUs are used.

===Rapids of Hanwa Line===
Trains to the Hanwa Line, for and for originate at either Tennoji or Kyobashi, and together with other types of rapid trains, operate on the inner loop via Osaka, pausing at Tennoji and then exiting from the loop. This pattern commenced in 1989, but increased significantly in 1994 on the opening of Kansai Airport.

8-car 223 series and 225 series EMUs in 4+4 formations are used for Kansai Airport and Kishūji rapids. 113 series 4-car units were used for rapids of Shin-Ōsaka - in early morning and late night. They were withdrawn in 2010.

===Limited express===
Charged Limited Express services such as &quot;Haruka&quot; for Kansai International Airport, and south bound &quot;Kuroshio&quot; on the Hanwa Line and Kisei Main Line (Kinokuni Line) heading for the scenic southern Wakayama Prefecture utilize the Osaka Loop Line to bypass the Tōkaidō Main Line and reach the Hanwa Line. On the loop, aside from Tennōji, limited numbers of trains stop only at Nishi-Kujō.

Between the Tōkaidō Main Line and the Osaka Loop Line, trains utilize the via a new underground route through Ōsaka Station, until it merges the main line at Shin-Ōsaka. This route was introduced in 1989 on the completion of a bypass track from the Hanwa Line to platforms of the Kansai Main Line at Tennōji. Until then no through operations were possible from the Hanwa Line.

281 series and 271 series EMUs are used for &quot;Haruka&quot;, 283 series EMUs, 287 series EMUs and 289 series EMUs for &quot;Kuroshio&quot;.

===Freight trains===
After the abandonment of the Naniwa freight terminal, freight trains on the line operate only between Fukushima and Nishikujō, from the &quot;Umeda Freight Line&quot; to on the Sakurajima Line (JR Yumesaki Line).

==Stations==
Listed counterclockwise: All stations are in the city of Osaka, Osaka Prefecture.
===Stopping patterns===

*● : All trains stop.
*▲ : Stop, outer loop (Tennoji → Nishikujo → Osaka → Kyobashi → Tennoji)

A special discount rate is applied for travels within the Osaka Loop Line, the Sakurajima Line and the segment between JR Namba Station and Tennōji Station of the Kansai Main Line (collectively called the ). The following table is the rate for adult single-ride tickets. (Note: Fractions of one kilometre are rounded up to the nearest full kilometre.)

For travel between a station within the zone and a station out of the zone or between two stations out of the zone, fares are calculated in accordance with a universal fare table and the discount rate as above is not applicable.

For the calculation of the fare for travel between two stations out of the zone that includes the segment between Ōsaka Station and Tennōji Station of the Osaka Loop Line, where two routes ( route via Temma and route via Fukushima) are practical, the shorter route is always used irrespective of the actual travel route.

==History==
The Ōsaka Loop Line consists of four segments, namely:
;Jōtō Line
:Eastern half of present line, Ōsaka – Tennōji via Kyōbashi
;Nishinari Line
:The northwestern quarter, Osaka – Nishi-Kujō
;Kansai Main Line freight line
:Southwestern portion, Tennōji – Sakaigawa Junction
;Purpose-built section
:The remainder to complete the loop, Nishi-Kujō – Sakaigawa Junction

===Jōtō Line===
The Ōsaka to Tennōji via Kyōbashi section (the eastern half of Osaka Loop Line) was opened by the (which also opened the present Minami Osaka Line network) to link it to the Japanese Government Railway (JGR) network in 1895. The line was opened in 2 stages: Tennōji – Tamatsukuri (2 mi. 28 chain, ca. 3.8 km) on 28 May; and Tamatsukuri – Umeda (4 mi. 29 chain, ca. 7.0 km) on 17 October.

Earlier, in 1889, the company opened its main line from – Tennōji – which includes a short section of the Osaka Loop Line, being Tennōji – ; Imamiya station itself, located between Tennōji and Minatomachi, was opened in 1890.

The Osaka Railway merged with the in 1900, creating a single entity for the line from Tennōji Station to JGR Ōsaka Station. The Kansai Railway was acquired by the national government in 1907 under the 1906 Railway Nationalization Act. In 1909 the line was named the .

In 1930, distrances were changed to metric, thus the distance changed from 6.6 miles. to 10.7 km. Electrification of the Jōtō Line was commissioned in 1933.

===Nishinari Line===
The Osaka to Nishi-Kujō section (the northwestern quarter of the line) was built by the to provide rail access to the Osaka Port. In 1898, the company opened the Osaka – line, which was leased to JGR in 1904. In 1906 the company was nationalized under the act of the same year. In 1909, the line was named the which included the present-day Sakurajima Line.

The Nishinari Line was electrified in 1941.

===Kansai Main Line Freight Line===
The Tennōji to Sakaigawa Signal Box (between Taishō and Bentenchō, closed in 2006 when the branch to the port closed) section (south-western portion of the loop) was constructed for freight traffic by the JGR to the port area in 1928, connecting to a freight branch line of the Kansai Main Line, Imamiya – – with a distance of 5.2 mi. (ca. 8.4 km). In 1930 with the change to metric measurement, it became 8.2 km. The former Osaka-Minato and Osaka-Tōkō stations were closed in 1984.

===Purpose-built loop line section===
To complete the Loop Line, new tracks were constructed between Nishi-Kujō and Sakaigawa Signal Box by the then Japanese National Railways. In 1961, this section opened and the new Osaka Loop Line was named for the entirety of the then Jōtō Line, Osaka – Nishi-Kujō section of the Nishinari Line (the rest, Nishi-Kujō – Sakurajima was named the Sakurajima Line) and the new Nishi-Kujō – Taishō – Tennōji section.

In 1964, operation as a complete Loop Line commenced with the opening of elevated double tracks around Nishi-Kujō. Until then the operation had been undertaken in the shape of a mirrored &quot;6&quot;, Sakurajima – Nishi-Kujō – Osaka – Kyōbashi – Tennōji – Nishi-Kujō. The Tennōji – Shin-Imamiya section was quadrupled in 1968, to separate operations from the Kansai Main Line.

<text>Valerie June Carter Cash (June 23, 1929 – May 15, 2003) was an American country singer and songwriter. A five-time Grammy award-winner, she was a member of the Carter Family and the second wife of singer Johnny Cash. Prior to her marriage to Cash, she was known as June Carter and continued to be credited as such even after her marriage (as well as on songwriting credits predating it). She played guitar, banjo, harmonica, and autoharp, and acted in several films and television shows. Carter Cash was inducted into the Christian Music Hall of Fame in 2009.

==Early life==
June Carter Cash was born Valerie June Carter in Maces Spring, Virginia, to Maybelle (née Addington) and Ezra Carter. Her mother was a country music performer with June&#x27;s aunt Sara and uncle A. P. Carter and she performed with the Carter Family from the age of 10, in 1939. In March 1943, when the Carter Family trio stopped recording together at the end of the WBT contract, Maybelle Carter, with encouragement from her husband Ezra, formed &quot;The Carter Sisters and Mother Maybelle&quot; with her daughters, Helen on accordion, Anita Carter on bass fiddle and June on autoharp and as front person and comedian. The new group first aired on radio station WRNL in Richmond, Virginia, on June 1. Doc (Addington) and Carl (McConnell)—Maybelle&#x27;s brother and cousin, respectively, known as &quot;The Virginia Boys&quot;, joined them in late 1945. June, then 16, was a co-announcer with Ken Allyn and did the commercials on the radio shows for Red Star Flour, Martha White, and Thalhimers Department Store, just to name a few. For the next year {1946}, the Carters and Doc and Carl did show dates within driving range of Richmond, through Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, and Pennsylvania. She attended John Marshall High School during this period. June later said she had to work harder at her music than her sisters, but she had her own special talent —comedy. A highlight of the road shows was her &quot;Aunt Polly&quot; comedy routine. With her thin and lanky frame, June Carter often played a comedic foil during the group&#x27;s performances alongside other Opry stars Faron Young and Webb Pierce. Carl McConnell wrote in his memoirs that June was &quot;a natural-born clown, if there ever was one&quot;. Decades later, Carter revived Aunt Polly for the 1976 TV series &quot;Johnny Cash &amp; Friends&quot;.

After Doc and Carl dropped out of the music business in late 1946, Maybelle and her daughters moved to Sunshine Sue Workman&#x27;s &quot;Old Dominion Barn Dance&quot; on the WRVA Richmond station. After a while there, they moved to WNOX in Knoxville, Tennessee, where they met Chet Atkins with Homer and Jethro.

In 1949, the Carter Sisters and Mother Maybelle, with their lead guitarist, Atkins, were living in Springfield, Missouri, and performing regularly at KWTO. Ezra &quot;Eck&quot; Carter, Maybelle&#x27;s husband and manager of the group, declined numerous offers from the Grand Ole Opry to move the act to Nashville, Tennessee, because the Opry would not permit Atkins to accompany the group onstage. Atkins&#x27; reputation as a guitar player had begun to spread, and studio musicians were fearful that he would displace them as a &#x27;first-call&#x27; player if he came to Nashville. Finally, in 1950, Opry management relented and the group, along with Atkins, became part of the Opry company. Here the family befriended Hank Williams and Elvis Presley (to whom they were distantly related), and June met Johnny Cash.

Carter and her sisters, with their mother Maybelle and aunt Sara joining in from time to time, reclaimed the name &quot;The Carter Family&quot; for their act during the 1960s and 1970s.

==Career highlights==

While Carter may be best known for singing and songwriting, she was also an author, dancer, actress, comedian, philanthropist, and humanitarian. Director Elia Kazan saw her perform at the Grand Ole Opry in 1955 and encouraged her to study acting. She studied with Lee Strasberg and Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre in New York. Her acting roles included Mrs. &quot;Momma&quot; Dewey in Robert Duvall&#x27;s 1998 movie &quot;The Apostle&quot;, Sister Ruth, wife to Johnny Cash&#x27;s character Kid Cole, on &quot;Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman&quot; (1993–97), and Clarise on &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; in 1957. She was notable as Mayhayley Lancaster playing alongside husband Cash in the 1983 television movie &quot;Murder in Coweta County&quot;. June was also Momma James in &quot;The Last Days of Frank and Jesse James&quot;. She also acted in occasional comedy skits for various Johnny Cash TV programs.

As a singer, she had both a solo career and a career singing with first her family and later her husband. As a solo artist, she became somewhat successful with upbeat country tunes of the 1950s, such as &quot;Jukebox Blues&quot; and the comedic hit &quot;No Swallerin&#x27; Place&quot; by Frank Loesser. Carter also recorded &quot;The Heel&quot; in the 1960s along with many other songs.

In the early 1960s, Carter wrote the song &quot;Ring of Fire&quot;, which later went on to be a hit for her future husband, Johnny Cash. She co-wrote the song with fellow songwriter Merle Kilgore. Carter wrote the lyrics about her relationship with Cash and she offered the song to her sister, Anita Carter, who was the first singer to record the song. In 1963, Cash recorded the song with the Carter Family singing backup and added mariachi horns. The song became a number-one hit and went on to become one of the most recognizable songs in the world of country music.
In her autobiography, &quot;I Walked the Line&quot;, Cash&#x27;s first wife Vivian Cash disputes the myth that Carter co-wrote the song &quot;Ring of Fire&quot;. Vivian relates the story that Cash told her in 1963: he wrote the song with Kilgore and Curly Lewis while fishing and he was going to give Carter half credit because &quot;[s]he needs the money. And I feel sorry for her.&quot;

Carter&#x27;s first notable studio performance with Johnny Cash occurred in 1964 when she duetted with Cash on &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Me Babe&quot;, a Bob Dylan composition, that was released as a single and on Cash&#x27;s album &quot;Orange Blossom Special&quot;. In 1967, the two found more substantial success with their recording of &quot;Jackson&quot;, which was followed by a collaboration album, &quot;Carryin&#x27; On with Johnny Cash and June Carter&quot;. All these releases predated her marriage to Cash, after which she changed her professional name to June Carter Cash. She continued to work with Cash on recordings and on stage for the rest of her life, recording a number of duets with Cash for his various albums and being a regular on &quot;The Johnny Cash Show&quot; from 1969 to 1971 and on Cash&#x27;s annual Christmas specials. After &quot;Carryin&#x27; On&quot;, Carter recorded one more direct collaboration album, &quot;Johnny Cash and His Woman&quot;, released in 1973, and, along with her daughters, was a featured vocalist on Cash&#x27;s 1974 album &quot;The Junkie and the Juicehead Minus Me&quot;. She also shared sleeve credit with her husband on a 2000 small-label gospel release, &quot;Return to the Promised Land.&quot;

Although she provided vocals on many recordings and shared the billing with Cash on several album releases, June Carter Cash only recorded three solo albums during her lifetime: the first, &quot;Appalachian Pride&quot;, released in 1975, &quot;Press On&quot; (1999), and &quot;Wildwood Flower&quot;, released posthumously in 2003 and produced by her son, John Carter Cash. &quot;Appalachian Pride&quot; is the only one of the three on which Johnny Cash does not perform, while &quot;Press On&quot; is notable for featuring Carter singing her original arrangement of &quot;Ring of Fire&quot;.

One of her final appearances was a non-speaking/non-singing appearance in the music video for her husband&#x27;s 2003 single, &quot;Hurt&quot;, filmed a few months before her death. One of her last known public appearances was on April 7, 2003, just over a month before her death, when she appeared on the CMT Flameworthy awards program to accept an achievement award on behalf of her husband, who was too ill to attend.

She won a Grammy award in 1999 for, &quot;Press On&quot;. Her last album, &quot;Wildwood Flower&quot;, won two additional Grammys. It contains bonus video enhancements showing extracts from the film of the recording sessions, which took place at the Carter Family estate in Hiltons, Virginia, on September 18–20, 2002. The songs on the album include &quot;Big Yellow Peaches&quot;, &quot;Sinking in the Lonesome Sea&quot;, &quot;Temptation&quot;, and the trademark staple &quot;Wildwood Flower&quot;. Due to her involvement in providing backing vocals on many of her husband&#x27;s recordings, a further posthumous release occurred in 2014, when &quot;Out Among the Stars&quot; was released under Johnny Cash&#x27;s name. The album consists of previously unreleased recordings from the early 1980s, including two on which June Carter Cash provides duet vocals.

Her autobiography was published in 1979, and she wrote a memoir, &quot;From the Heart&quot;, almost 10 years later.

==Personal life==

Carter was married three times and had one child with each husband. All three of her children went on to have successful careers in country music. She was married first to country singer Carl Smith from July 9, 1952, until their divorce in 1956. Together, they wrote &quot;Time&#x27;s A-Wastin&quot;. They had a daughter, Rebecca Carlene Smith, known professionally as Carlene Carter, a country musician. Carter&#x27;s second marriage was to Edwin &quot;Rip&quot; Nix, a former football player and police officer, on November 11, 1957. They had a daughter, Rosie Nix Adams, on July 13, 1958, who became a country/rock singer. The couple divorced in 1966. Their daughter died in 2003, at the age of 45, from accidental carbon monoxide poisoning in a school bus that had been converted into a campervan.

Carter and the entire Carter Family had performed with Johnny Cash for a number of years. In 1968, Cash proposed to Carter during a live performance at the London Ice House in London, Ontario. They married on March 1 in Franklin, Kentucky. They had one son, John Carter Cash, who is a musician, songwriter, and producer. The couple remained married until her death in May 2003, four months before Cash died.

She also gained four stepdaughters from her third husband&#x27;s previous marriage to Vivian Liberto, including Cindy and Rosanne.

Carter&#x27;s distant cousin, the 39th U.S. president Jimmy Carter, became closely acquainted with Cash and Carter and maintained their friendship throughout their lifetimes. In a June 1977 speech, Jimmy Carter acknowledged that June Carter was his distant cousin.

Carter was a longtime supporter of SOS Children&#x27;s Villages. In 1974, the Cashes donated money to help build a village near their home in Barrett Town, Jamaica, which they visited frequently, playing the guitar and singing songs to the children in the village.

Carter also had close relationships with a number of entertainers, including Audrey Williams, James Dean, Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Jessi Colter, Kris Kristofferson, Willie Nelson, Elvis Presley, Robert Duvall, and Roy Orbison.

At the end of her life, she and her husband attended the First Baptist Church in Hendersonville, Tennessee.

===Death===
In April 2003, Carter was diagnosed with a leaky heart valve, and doctors told her that valve replacement surgery was the only solution for her issue. She had the surgery on May 7; however, complications arose, and her health deteriorated rapidly over the next few days. She died on May 15, 2003, at the age of 73. She was surrounded by her family, including her husband of 35 years, Johnny Cash. Public funeral services were held at the First Baptist Church in Hendersonville, Tennessee. At Carter&#x27;s funeral, her stepdaughter Rosanne Cash stated, &quot;If being a wife were a corporation, June would have been a CEO. It was her most treasured role.&quot; Johnny Cash died of complications from diabetes on September 12. Carter&#x27;s daughter Rosie Nix Adams died on October 24. All three are buried at the Hendersonville Memory Gardens near their home in Hendersonville, Tennessee.

==Awards==
Carter and her then-future husband, Johnny Cash, reached number 2 on the U.S. Country charts with their 1967 duet of &quot;Jackson&quot;. Their performance won the 1968 Grammy Award for Best Country &amp; Western Performance Duet, Trio or Group. The two won the 1971 Grammy Award, for Best Country Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group, for their 1970 duet &quot;If I Were a Carpenter&quot;.

Carter Cash won the 2000 Grammy Award, for Best Traditional Folk Album, for her 1999 album &quot;Press On&quot;. The album was a top-15 success on the Americana chart. Carter Cash&#x27;s last album, &quot;Wildwood Flower&quot;, was released posthumously in 2003. Carter Cash won the 2004 Grammy Award for Best Traditional Folk Album, and she also won the 2004 Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance for the single &quot;Keep on the Sunny Side&quot;.

== Philanthropy ==
Carter Cash, along with her husband, Johnny Cash, worked with and gave money to the group, SOS Children&#x27;s Villages, throughout their lives. They began this involvement in 1973 when they donated $12,000 ($75,351 in 2022 terms) to build an orphanage in a Jamaican village close to their home in that country. They would visit the nearby village during their time spent in Jamaica and play with the children and sing songs to them. When Cash died in 2003, their family asked that donations be made to the SOS Children&#x27;s Villages due to the couple&#x27;s involvement. In a quote from a representative of the Prime Minister of Jamaica at the time, P.J. Patterson, talks about their charitable works in the country, &quot;A philanthropist extraordinaire, Mrs. Cash made Jamaica her second home and loved and cared deeply for the people of her adopted country. A gifted and talented singer, she and her husband, Johnny Cash, used the very talents for the benefit of many charities in and around Montego Bay.&quot;

==Legacy==
In 2003, Carter was included by Country Music Television on their list of the &quot;40 Greatest Women of Country Music&quot;.

Carter was played by Reese Witherspoon in &quot;Walk the Line&quot;, a 2005 biographical film of Johnny Cash (played by Joaquin Phoenix). The film largely focused on the development of their relationship over the course of 13 years, from their first meeting to her final acceptance of his proposal of marriage. Witherspoon performed all vocals for the role, singing many of Carter&#x27;s famous songs, including &quot;Juke Box Blues&quot; and &quot;Jackson&quot; with Phoenix. Witherspoon won an Academy Award, Golden Globe, BAFTA and Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actress in the role.

Musician and actress Jewel portrayed Carter in the Lifetime television movie &quot;Ring of Fire&quot;, which aired on May 27, 2013. The film is based on John Carter Cash&#x27;s memoir &quot;Anchored in Love: An Intimate Portrait of June Carter Cash.&quot;

Carter was played by Erin Beute in the 2019 television movie &quot;Patsy &amp; Loretta&quot;.
