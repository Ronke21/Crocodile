<text>The Salii, Salians, or Salian priests were the &quot;leaping priests&quot; of Mars in ancient Roman religion, supposed to have been introduced by King Numa Pompilius. They were twelve patrician youths dressed as archaic warriors with an embroidered tunic, a breastplate, a short red cloak (), a sword, and a spiked headdress called an apex. They were charged with the twelve bronze shields called , whichlike those of the Mycenaeansresembled a figure eight. One of the shields was said to have fallen from heaven in the reign of King Numa and eleven copies were made to protect the identity of the sacred shield on the advice of the nymph Egeria, consort of Numa, who prophesied that wherever that shield was preserved, the people would be the dominant people of the earth.

Each year in March, the Salii made a procession round the city, dancing and singing the . Ovid, who relates the story of Numa and the heavenly in his , found the hymn and the Salian rituals outdated and hard to understand. During the Principate, by decree of the Senate, Augustus&#x27;s name was inserted into the song. They ended the day by banqueting. &quot;Table of the Salii&quot; () became proverbial in Latin for a sumptuous feast. It is unclear whether the primary aim of the ritual was to protect Rome&#x27;s army, although this is the traditional view.

King Tullus Hostilius is said to have established another collegium of Salii in fulfillment of a vow which he made in the second war with Fidenae and Veii. These Salii Collini were also twelve in number, chosen from the Patricians, and appeared to have been dedicated to the service of Quirinus.

The Salii are sometimes credited with the opening and closing of the war cycle which would last from March to October.

== Name ==
 is the plural form of , a noun and adjective that seem to derive from (&quot;to jump, to leap&quot;) and to be cognate with (&quot;to dance, to jump&quot;). They were sometimes known as the Palatine Salii () to distinguish them from the priests of Quirinius. They are also known in English as the Salians or the Salian Priests. The Salii Collini were also known as the Agonales or Agonenses.

==Origin==
According to legend, Numa Pompilius established the Salii Palatini, which honored the god Mars, while Tullus Hostilius established the Salii Collini which honored the god Quirinus. 

An origin among the Etruscans is attributed to a founding by Morrius, king of Veii. The Salii are also given an origin in connection with Dardanus and the Samothracian Di Penates, and the Salius who came to Italy with Evander and in the &quot;Aeneid&quot; competed in the funeral games of Anchises. Indeed in book VIII of The Aeneid, while in the land of King Evander Aeneas is entertained by the Salii during a feast, who are commemorating the fame and feasts of Hercules.

Ancient authors quoted by Maurus Servius Honoratus and Macrobius recorded that Salii had existed at Tibur, Tusculum and Veii even before their creation in Rome.

== Role ==
The twelve &quot;Salii&quot; used song and dance as part of religious ritual. They were state sponsored and considered important for the maintenance of the Roman social order. Their dances were also used to tell religious or historical stories. The &quot;Salii&quot; honored the gods Jupiter, Janus, and Mars. This dance was referred to as the &quot;tripudium&quot;. Horace describes the Salii performing this dance by stamping their feet three times. Their dance was also associated with leaping and jumping. Seneca the Younger wrote that it was a popular dance that required professional training to perform. It is possible that the term &quot;tripudium&quot; referred to a variety of dances. Alongside dancing, the Salii would sing songs known as the . Varro claimed that the Salian priests did not understand the meanings of the lyrics they sang. It is possible they contained older spellings and archaic words. Plutarch describes them chanting and dancing with a quick rhythm. He also wrote that they would beat daggers on shields to create music. These shields were known as &quot;ancile&quot;. Other descriptions stated that used flutes to sing the songs. The &quot;Salii&quot; wore embroidered tunics under purple &quot;trabeae&quot; with bronze helmets and belts during their festivals. They also wore garlands of white ribbons, a conical cap known as an &quot;apex&quot;, and wheat sheaves. Some wore &quot;togae praetextae&quot; around their waists. Their rituals took place in March, during the Spring equinox. If a &quot;Salius&quot; was elected consul, flamen, pontifex, or augur, they would resign from their position in the &quot;Salii&quot;.

== Salian virgins ==
Sextus Pompeius Festus makes a perplexing reference to &quot;Salian virgins&quot; (). Wearing the &quot;paludamentum&quot; and pointed &quot;apex&quot; of the Salii, these women were employed to assist the College of Pontiffs in carrying out sacrifices in the Regia. It has been suggested that the passage in Festus describes a transvestite initiation. An earlier explanation held that the maidens played the role of absent warriors in some form of propitiation. The possibility of their being &quot;hired&quot; is disputed, as is their status, but the use of &quot;virgines&quot; implies that they were freeborn citizens. 

== Interpretations of the rituals ==
There is no single overreaching description of the Salii&#x27;s rituals throughout the month of March from any of the ancient authors, and facts have to be reconstructed from multiple mentions in diverse works; however, there are strong indications that the procession may actually have lasted a full 24 days, from March 1st which opened the festival until March 24th, which closed it, with the procession moving from one station to another each day, and with revels being held each evening; a complete assessment can be found in Smith, Wayte, &amp; Marindin (1890). 

Classical philologist Georg Wissowa maintained that the ritual of the Salii is a war dance or a sword dance, with their costumes clearly indicating their military origin. Georges Dumézil interpreted the rituals of the Salii as marking the opening and the closing of the yearly war season. The opening would coincide with the day of the Agonium Martiale on March 17, and the closing with the day of the Armilustrium on October 19. The first date was also referred to as &quot;ancilia movere&quot;, &quot;to move the &quot;ancilia&quot;,&quot; and the second as &quot;ancilia condere&quot;, &quot;to store (or hide) the &quot;ancilia&quot;.&quot; Dumezil views the two groups of Salii — one representing Mars and the other Quirinus — as a dialectic relationship, showing the interdependency of the military and economic functions in Roman society. Wissowa compares the Salii with the noble youth who dance the &quot;Lusus Troiae&quot;: thus, the ritual dance of the Salii would be a coalescence of an initiation into adulthood and war, with a scapegoat ritual (see also &quot;pharmakos)&quot;. Other 19th-century scholars have compared the rituals of the Salii with the Vedic myths of Indra and the Maruts.

Because the earliest Roman calendar had begun with the month of March, Hermann Usener thought the ceremonies of the &quot;ancilia movere&quot; were a ritual expulsion of the old year, represented by the mysterious figure of Mamurius Veturius, to make way for the new god Mars, born on March 1. On the Ides of March, a man ritually named as Mamurius Veturius was beaten with long white sticks in the &quot;sacrum Mamurii&quot;; in Usener&#x27;s view, this was a form of scapegoating. Mamurius was the mythic blacksmith who forged eleven replicas of the original divine shield that had dropped from the sky. According to Usener and Ludwig Preller, Mars would be a god of war and fertility while Mamurius Veturius would mean &quot;Old Mars&quot;. Mars is himself a dancer, and the head of the Salian dancers, patrician young men whose parents were both living (&quot;patrimi&quot; and &quot;matrimi&quot;).

== Nomenclature ==
* Numa&#x27;s Salii Palatini were dedicated to Mars surnamed &quot;Gradivus&quot; (meaning &quot;he who walks into battle&quot;), and were quartered on the Palatine Hill.
* Tullus&#x27; Salii Collini were dedicated to Quirinus, and were quartered on the Quirinal Hill. Rosinus called them &quot;Agonenses Salii&quot;. The second group of Salii may in fact have been created during an Augustan reorganization of the priesthood. Paulus ex Festo p. 10 M reads: &quot;... Agones dicebant montes, Agonia sacrificia quae fiebant in monte; hinc Romae mons Quirinalis Agonus et Collina Porta Agonensis&quot;: &quot;Agones were called the mounts, Agonia the sacrifices that took place on the mounts; hence in Rome the Quirinal mount (is named) Agonus and the Porta Collina Agonensis&quot;.

<doc id="239785" wikidata="Q1462368" url="?curid=239785" title="Jeeves and Wooster">
<text>Jeeves and Wooster is a British comedy television series adapted by Clive Exton from P. G. Wodehouse&#x27;s &quot;Jeeves&quot; stories. It aired on the ITV network from 22 April 1990 to 20 June 1993, with the last series nominated for a British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series. Set in the UK and the US in an unspecified period between the late 1920s and the 1930s, the series starred Hugh Laurie as Bertie Wooster, an affable young gentleman and member of the idle rich, and Stephen Fry as Jeeves, his highly intelligent and competent valet. Bertie and his friends, who are mainly members of the Drones Club, are extricated from all manner of societal misadventures by the indispensable Jeeves.

When Fry and Laurie began the series, they were already a popular comedic double act for their regular appearances on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Live&quot; and their own show &quot;A Bit of Fry &amp; Laurie&quot; (BBC, 1987–95).

In the television documentary &quot;Fry and Laurie Reunited&quot; (2010), the actors, reminiscing about their involvement in the series, revealed that they were initially reluctant to play the parts of Jeeves and Wooster, but eventually decided to do so because the series was going to be made with or without them, and they felt no one else would do the parts justice.

The series was a collaboration between Brian Eastman of Picture Partnership Productions and Granada Television.

== Theme and opening credits ==
The theme (called &quot;Jeeves and Wooster&quot;) is an original piece of music in the jazz/swing style written by composer Anne Dudley for the programme. Dudley uses variations of the theme as a basis for all of the episodes&#x27; scores and was nominated for a British Academy Television Award for her work on the third series.

== Characters ==
Many of the programme&#x27;s supporting roles – including significant characters such as Aunt Agatha, Madeline Bassett and Gussie Fink-Nottle – were played by more than one actor. One prominent character, Aunt Dahlia, was played by a different actress in each of the four series. Francesca Folan played two very different characters: Madeline Bassett in series one and Lady Florence Craye in series four. The character of Stiffy Byng was played by Charlotte Attenborough in series two and by Amanda Harris in series three and then by Attenborough again in series four. Richard Braine, who took over the role of Gussie Fink-Nottle in series three and four, also appeared as the conniving Rupert Steggles in series one. Aside from Fry and Laurie, the only actors to appear as the same character in all four series are John Woodnutt as Sir Watkyn Bassett and Robert Daws as Tuppy Glossop.

== Episodes ==

== Reception ==

The third series of &quot;Jeeves and Wooster&quot; won a British Academy Television Award for Best Design for Eileen Diss. The final series won a British Academy Television Award for Best Graphics for Derek W. Hayes and was nominated for a British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series; it also earned a British Academy Television Award for Best Original Television Music for Anne Dudley and a British Academy Television Award for Best Costume Design for Dany Everett.

In retrospect, Michael Brooke of BFI Screenonline called screenwriter Clive Exton &quot;the series&#x27; real star&quot;, saying his &quot;adaptations come surprisingly close to capturing the flavour of the originals&quot; by &quot;retaining many of Wodehouse&#x27;s most inspired literary similes.&quot;

Christopher Lee analyzed the costumes of both Jeeves and Wooster for the &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Gazette&quot;, and concludes that &quot;Wooster represents the dandy, willing to experiment with style and change. Jeeves is the voice of tradition and conservative style.&quot;

== Home releases ==
Granada Media released all four series on DVD in Region 2 between 2000 and 2002. On 1 September 2008, ITV Studios Home Entertainment released &quot;Jeeves and Wooster: The Complete Collection&quot;, an eight-disc box set featuring all 23 episodes of the series.

In Region 1, A&amp;E Home Entertainment, under licence from Granada Media Entertainment, released the complete 23-episode collection on DVD in the US and Canada.

In Region 4, Shock Entertainment has released the entire series on DVD in Australia. It was initially released in season sets in 2007/2008, followed by a complete series collection on 4 August 2008.

<doc id="239787" wikidata="Q6988043" url="?curid=239787" title="Neighborhood of Make-Believe">
<text>The Neighborhood of Make-Believe is the fictional kingdom inhabited by hand puppet characters on the children&#x27;s television series &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot;, which originally aired on PBS (and its predecessor NET) from 1968 to 2001, and its predecessor &quot;Mister Rogers&quot;, which originally aired on CBC from 1963 to 1966. Principal puppeteer Fred Rogers developed many of the characters in the 1950s for Josie Carey&#x27;s program &quot;The Children&#x27;s Corner&quot;. Both shows were shot in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

==Overview==
The adventures of the Make-Believe Neighborhood citizens appear in a short segment once in the middle of almost every episode. Rogers deliberately makes the distinction between the real world and the Neighborhood of Make-Believe clear by transitioning in and out of the Neighborhood segment via a distinctive red and yellow model electric trolley that enters and exits through small tunnels in the wall or occasionally by setting up small tabletop models of the various Neighborhood of Make Believe buildings and by discussing what had happened with his audience after the end of each segment. The same storyline continues for a week or more similar to that of a soap opera, though Rogers always recaps the plot for the audience as well.

== Characters ==
Characters in the Neighborhood of Make-Believe were portrayed by both hand puppets operated by puppeteers and on-screen actors. They would occasionally talk to the viewers in specific episodes.

===Regular puppets===
* (performed by Fred Rogers in the original series, Matt Vogel in &quot;Donkey Hodie&quot;) – King Friday XIII is the imperious monarch of the neighborhood. He is relatively egocentric, irrational, resistant to change, and temperamental, although open-minded enough to listen when told he is wrong. He has a fondness for giving long-winded speeches and using big words. When meeting with someone, he would quote &quot;[insert character name here], I presume.&quot; He or she would respond: &quot;Correct as usual/always, King Friday.&quot; King Friday has two pet wooden birds named &quot;Troglodytes aedon&quot; and &quot;Mimus polyglottos&quot; (the scientific names, in genus and species, of the house wren and the northern mockingbird, respectively). Mimus appeared first in Episode #20 from 1968 and Troglodytes appeared in Episode #1285 from 1973. King Friday also uses big words for certain songs like &quot;Twinkle Twinkle Little Star&quot; and &quot;Row, Row, Row Your Boat&quot;, which he refers to as &quot;Royal versions&quot;. King Friday was the second puppet to appear on &quot;Children&#x27;s Corner&quot;.
* Queen Sara Saturday (performed by Fred Rogers) – Queen Sara Saturday is King Friday&#x27;s wife. She was first introduced as a commoner from Westwood on Episode #32 and the two married in Episode #1015. In the third-season episode #1117, they had a son named Prince Tuesday. Queen Sara is more rational and level-headed than her husband. She frequently mentions doing charity work for Food for the World. Queen Sara was named for and resembles Fred Rogers&#x27; wife, Sara Joanne Rogers.
* Prince Tuesday (performed by Adair Roth (pre-1979 seasons), Fred Michael (1979–1980), Charles Altman (1981–1986), briefly Carole Switala, Lenny Meledandri (1987–2001)) – Prince Tuesday is the son of King Friday and Queen Sara. Born in the third season (Episode #1117) and named for the day of the week when he was born, Prince Tuesday is one of only two characters to age during the course of the series (he starts as a baby, then a toddler; and from 1979 onward, he is elementary school-aged). He is curious and enthusiastic and attends the school in Someplace-Else.
* (performed by Fred Rogers) – X the Owl lives in an old oak tree in the Neighborhood. He is eager and cheerful and has a strong desire to learn new things. Many of X&#x27;s stories involve assignments from the Owl Correspondence School and he idolizes Benjamin Franklin. He also has trouble making decisions. X was the third puppet to appear on &quot;Children&#x27;s Corner&quot;.
* (performed by Fred Rogers) – Henrietta Pussycat is X&#x27;s neighbor and lives in a small yellow and orange school house supported by a strong limb on the tree. Early episodes established her as the governess of several nice mice, thus the schoolhouse. She has a habit of randomly inserting &quot;meow&quot; into her sentences due to being a cat. When she was first introduced, she could only say &quot;beautiful&quot;, &quot;telephone&quot;, and &quot;Mister Rogers&quot;, in addition to &quot;meow&quot;. She is anxious, preoccupied with beauty, and prone to jealousy. She also was the flower girl at Betty and James&#x27; wedding. She is the fourth puppet to appear on &quot;Children&#x27;s Corner&quot;.
* Lady Elaine Fairchilde (performed by Fred Rogers) – Lady Elaine Fairchilde is an outspoken, cranky schemer who moved to the Neighborhood from Someplace Else to run the Museum-Go-Round after the Froggs moved out in early 1969. Lady Elaine was often known to say &quot;Okay, toots,&quot; and is generally the antagonist when a storyline calls for one. One of her prized possessions is her Boomerang-Toomerang-Zoomerang, with which she can turn the neighborhood upside-down. Although a frequent antagonist (hinted at times to hide possible insecurities), she is not portrayed as evil, but as someone who challenges authority, particularly King Friday&#x27;s authority, as she often has rows with the king. She first appeared in Episode #5 of &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot; and is named after Fred&#x27;s adopted sister.
* (performed by Fred Rogers) – Daniel Stripèd Tiger is the first puppet ever to appear on &quot;Children&#x27;s Corner&quot; and &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot;. He is a shy tiger who lives in a non-functioning grandfather clock with no hands, as it is whatever time can change in The Land Of Make-Believe. Despite his shyness, Daniel exhibits wisdom and intelligence when he does speak. His favorite toy is a small dump truck and he wears a watch on one arm because he lives in the clock and always has to know what time it is. He was the ring bearer for Betty and James&#x27;s wedding. He was named after Dorothy Daniel, who gave Fred his first puppet. Daniel was the puppet most frequently brought along by Rogers for live performances and Rogers stated that Daniel represented certain aspects of his personality. In July 2011, PBS announced that Daniel&#x27;s son (also named Daniel) would be the star of his own show &quot;Daniel Tiger&#x27;s Neighborhood&quot;.
* Cornflake &quot;Corney&quot; S. Pecially (performed by Fred Rogers) – Cornflake S. Pecially is a beaver-like character who is the proprietor of a factory specializing in rocking chairs. His original factory caught fire and was damaged during the first season, and his neighbors pitched in to help him rebuild. Corney has also been known to produce dolls, pretzels, model trolleys, and other goods. He debuted on &quot;Mister Rogers&quot;, the precursor of &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot;. Corney&#x27;s middle initial and last name are a play on the word &quot;especially.&quot;
* Grandpere Tiger (performed by Fred Rogers) – His real name being &quot;Henri Frederique de Tigre&quot;, Grandpere Tiger is a French tiger and bon-vivant who lives to the left of the castle in the Eiffel Tower. He has a very kind heart and often donates the use of the tower to his neighbors whenever they ask.
* Collette Tiger (performed by Fred Rogers) - Collete is Grandpère&#x27;s granddaughter who lives in France and appears in 1971 and 1984. At first, Henrietta Pussycat becomes jealous of Collette because of her beauty. In time, they become good friends.
* The Frogg Family – The Frogg Family are a family of frogs who were the original curators of the Museum-Go-Round. The family is made up of Dr. Frank Lee Frogg who works as a pediatrician, Mrs. Frogg, and their son Tadpole. The family moved to Westwood during the first color week of the series and were only seen infrequently after that.
* The Platypus Family – The Platypus Family are duck-billed platypuses who live in a mound. It consists of Dr. Bill Platypus (performed by Bill Barker in a Scottish accent), his wife Elsie Jean Platypus (also performed by Bill Barker) and their daughter Ornithorhynchus Anatinus (Ana) Platypus (the Latin scientific name for a platypus) (performed by Carole Muller Switala). Along with Prince Tuesday, she is one of two puppet characters to age during the series. Ana has four grandparents: Grandma Nell Platypus, Grandpa Tom Platypus (maternal), Nana Platypus and Dada Platypus (paternal). Dr. Bill works at the Eiffel Tower where Grandpère lives and plays the bagpipes. &quot;Doc Bill&quot; plays on the word &quot;duck-bill.&quot;
* (performed by Bob Trow in the original series, Stephanie D&#x27;Abruzzo in &quot;Donkey Hodie&quot;) – Harriet Elizabeth Cow is the school teacher and Donkey Hodie&#x27;s co-worker in Someplace-Else. She played the organ for Betty and James&#x27; wedding and is named after Fred Rogers&#x27; aunt.
* Edgar Cooke (performed by Fred Rogers) – Edgar Cooke is the chef of the castle who sings everything he says, per King Friday&#x27;s request for a &quot;singing chef&quot;
* H.J. Elephant III (performed by Chuck Aber) – H.J. Elephant III is one of Prince Tuesday&#x27;s friends.
* Betty Okonak Templeton-Jones (performed by Michael Horton) – Betty Okonak Templeton-Jones is the longtime friend of Lady Elaine who occasionally comes to visit from Southwood. She was a widow until marrying James Michael Jones.
* James Michael Jones (performed by Michael Horton) – James Michael Jones is Betty Okonak Templeton-Jones&#x27;s second husband. James is a resident of Glassland where he did &quot;Exactly Like Me&quot; portraits (which are really mirrors).
* Carrie Dell Okonak Templeton-Jones – Known as &quot;Carrie Dell&quot; for short, Carrie Dell Okonak Templeton-Jones is the adopted daughter of James Michael Jones and Betty Okonak Templeton-Jones.
* Old Goat (performed by Tom Megalis in the first storyline, Michael Horton in the second storyline) – Old Goat is a resident of Northwood and speaks only in &quot;goat sounds&quot;.
* New Goat (performed by Sara Locklard) - New Goat is a resident of Northwood and can translate for Old Goat.
* Donkey Hodie (performed by Fred Rogers in the original series, David Rudman in &quot;Donkey Hodie&quot;)
:Donkey Hodie is a donkey that lives in Someplace Else with Harriet Elizabeth Cow and operates a Washer Dryer Sorter Dumper there. Originally, Donkey Hodie came to the Neighborhood of Make-Believe to build a windmill, but King Friday didn&#x27;t like having it so close to the castle. At the scientific advice of Scientist Adler, Donkey Hodie relocated to Someplace Else. The name &quot;Donkey Hodie&quot; is a pun of the name of &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, and the windmill storyline is a spoof of Don Quixote&#x27;s penchant for tilting at windmills. Donkey Hodie has a series which aired on May 3, 2021, and was redesigned as a more modern felt-faced puppet. The titular character from &quot;Donkey Hodie&quot; is the granddaughter of the original Donkey Hodie, and the original Donkey Hodie is referred as Grampy Hodie.
* Hilda Dingleboarder (performed by Barbara Russell) - An employee at Corney&#x27;s factory. She once invented a recycling machine when the Neighborhood of Make-Believe faced a garbage crisis.
* Yo-Yo LaBelle (performed by Michael Horton) - An alien from the stars. All he can say is &quot;Mee&quot; and &quot;Thee.&quot; Only Daniel Striped Tiger can understand what Yo-Yo LaBelle is saying.
* Audrey Duck (performed by Susan Linn) - An occasional visitor to the Neighborhood of Make-Believe.
* Catalion (performed by Susan Linn) - A lion who is an occasional visitor to the Neighborhood of Make-Believe and is a friend of Audrey Duck.
* Mr. Skunk (performed by Chuck Aber) - A skunk who lives in Westwood and occasionally visits the Neighborhood of Make-Believe. As he is insecure, he tends to spray when nervous or startled.
* Neighborhood Trolley – A small, red, sentient electric trolley that enters and exits the Neighborhood of Make-Believe, taking the viewers of the show with it. Known simply as &quot;Trolley&quot;, it communicates through the uses of its whistle of a steam locomotive and bell and occasionally moves backwards and forwards to get the other characters&#x27; attention or to show that it is getting impatient, and a musical melody is usually heard every time the Trolley moves along its tracks. It can go both fast and slow. Also, when lifted from the tracks, it can show pictures from the past, as revealed in the episodes &quot;Then and Now&quot;.
* Arthur Timothy Read (performed by Michael Yarmush) - Was a guest puppet as an aardvark from Elwood City appearing in &quot;Go Stop Go&quot;.

===Live characters===
These characters, some in costumes, are much larger than the puppet characters and sometimes help the puppets with tasks such as lifting or moving large objects, which the small puppet characters are unable to do. Some of these live characters include:

* Lady Aberlin (portrayed by Betty Aberlin) – King Friday&#x27;s niece and frequently the &quot;main&quot; character of the segments. Often the only full-sized character in the neighborhood segments, she acts as something of a level-headed older sister to the puppets and audience alike, and an audience surrogate, providing exposition for the story&#x27;s narrative. She can occasionally be seen dancing around the Neighborhood whenever she&#x27;s by herself. Sometimes nicknamed Lady A, she was one of Betty&#x27;s brides-maids along with Lady Elaine for Betty and James&#x27; wedding. She also sometimes acts as a surrogate mother to Daniel Tiger, as, unlike Prince Tuesday or Ana Platypus, he has no parental figures, but attends school with them. She is the daughter of King Friday&#x27;s older sister Claire, and her cousins are Prince Tuesday, as well as the sons of Friday&#x27;s younger brother Paul (these include Nicky, Qwentin, Paulie and Kevin). After Prince Tuesday, and the sons of King Friday&#x27;s brother, Lady Aberlin is next in line for the throne of the kingdom.
* Mr. McFeely (portrayed by David Newell) – The &quot;Speedy Delivery&quot; delivery man. He sometimes delivers letters and packages to the citizens of the Neighborhood of Make-Believe. Generally if a package from OCS (Owl Correspondence School) is being delivered to X the Owl, Mr. McFeely delivers it. He is one of a few characters to pass between Mr. Rogers&#x27; &quot;real&quot; world and the Neighborhood of Make-Believe.
* Handyman Negri (portrayed by Joe Negri) – The friendly, avuncular neighborhood handyman. Plays the guitar. However, he was also originally known as Joe Negri in the early days of the Neighborhood of Make-Believe.

A talented opera singer who usually sang with Francois Clemmons in the &quot;real&quot; world, she appeared in three of the Neighborhood operas (twice as herself, once as Pilot Ito).
* Robert Troll (portrayed by Bob Trow) – The gibberish-speaking whimsical troll who is the friend of the castle. Robert Troll has many hidden talents as he is an artist, and is good at understanding things in nature. He is sometimes called &quot;Robertroll&quot;. Robert Troll is a pun on his actor Robert Trow.
* Miss Paulificate (portrayed by Audrey Roth) – The telephone operator at the Castle. Storylines often allude to her former career as a dancer and she often demonstrates her tap-dancing abilities. She frequently takes the brunt of King Friday&#x27;s bad moods.
* Nurse Miller (portrayed by Maxine Miller) - A nurse who works for Dr. Frogg.
* Mayor Maggie (portrayed by Maggie Stewart) – The Mayor of Westwood, a democracy bordering the Neighborhood of Make-Believe. She was introduced in the 1970s to show that women can run for mayor too. By contrast, the Neighborhood of Make-Believe is a monarchy, the throne of which is inherited by male-preference primogeniture. She is fluent in sign language. Despite being a leader of similar stature to the King, she is frequently roped into doing his bidding.
* Charles R. Aber: Westwood Neighbor (portrayed by Chuck Aber) – Also known as Neighbor Aber, he is the associate of Mayor Maggie of Westwood. During the course of the series, he also holds the position of a Clown T-shirt salesman, delivery man, and pilot. It is revealed that he is divorced and doesn&#x27;t get to see his kids much. Despite living in Westwood, Aber is a frequent character in the Neighborhood of Make-Believe from 1981 to the end.

* Dr. Marchl (portrayed my William Marchl) - A doctor who knows everything.

==Geography==
The Land of Make-Believe was staged with a theatrical set design, landmarks include (from left to right):

* Eiffel Tower – The only structure located left of the Castle; dark green and blue with red railing. There is also a red flashing light on top. Grandpere Tiger lives here. Its name and appearance is based on the real Eiffel Tower in Paris.
* King Friday&#x27;s Castle – This is usually the first location seen in the Land of Make Believe as Trolley enters from a tunnel on its left side. Three different castles were featured in the show. For the first 27 episodes (in black and white), the castle was a very small (and presumably blue-colored as were the two forthcoming castles) two-tier structure with two archways in the lower tier and one archway in the combined square/round tower at the top. A television antennae was mounted in one of the square tower&#x27;s front corners. On March 27, 1968, a larger castle was debuted without advance notice. This was also a two-tier structure with two archways in each and one polygonal tower at the top. A gold XIII plate was mounted on the front panel of the upper walkway. A new service entrance archway for employees and guests was built to the castle&#x27;s right on the other side of the trolley tracks where it remained for the rest of the series. On February 27, 1969, the day before King Friday married Queen Sara Saturday, Lady Elaine used her boomerang and Handyman Negri played Brahms&#x27; Second Symphony on his guitar to magically change the old castle into a newer, even larger castle as their wedding gift to the royal couple. This became the well-known castle used for the remainder of the series: three-tier structure with seven archways; two in the lower tier, three in the center, and one in each of the two round towers at the top. The gold XIII was now under the second tier&#x27;s widest archway where King Friday and Queen Sara came out to greet visitors. A carpeted exterior staircase was added to the left. A decorative waterfall/fountain was installed in front of the left side in 1971; King Friday would donate the waterfall to the people of Westwood many years later.
* Trolley Bridge/Tracks – There are two trolley routes in the Neighborhood. One is the usual route taken by the Neighborhood Trolley which is a concrete bridge that runs in front of the castle, entering the Neighborhood from the &quot;real&quot; world via tunnel on the left of the castle and running to the right tunnel next to the Castle&#x27;s service entrance (and vice versa when it was time to return to the &quot;real&quot; world). The original trolley bridge for the first 27 episodes of the series ran a circular alignment to the original structure which castle guests had to cross under. When the castle was enlarged in the middle of the first season, the bridge was extended, widened and modified to make it easier for castle guests to cross under. A second route was occasionally used in which the Trolley ran past the other residences in the Neighborhood. 
* Tele-can – The neighborhood can-and-string phone was originally located in a booth adjacent to the Rocking Chair Factory and Great Oak Tree. The booth was later reconstructed into a cage suspended in air and moved in front of the castle trolley tracks. Whenever anyone needed to make a call (via Miss Paulifficate, the castle operator), he or she would stand under the cage, look up and signal for the cage to come down.
* Rocking Chair Factory – Located to the right of the Castle service entrance. Cornflake S. Pecially lives and works here. The original structure consisted of lights, dials and meters and a wide open tier at the top where Corny greeted and talked to his friends and customers. There was also a storage box to the left of the main structure. On May 15, 1968, the factory was destroyed by an accidental fire in the boiler room. Two days later, a new larger factory was completed. This was a pink colored structure (not revealed to TV viewers until the first color episode on February 10, 1969) with &quot;Rockit&quot; in script lettering and new blinking lights, dials and meters. Additional features included a revolving gear wheel and a display case with three rocking chairs. 
* Great Oak Tree – Located in the center of the neighborhood, it is residence to Henrietta Pussycat, who lives in a small yellow schoolhouse-shaped structure with red double doors and a yellow bell within the branches of the tree, as well as to X the Owl, whose home is entered through an orange door with crossbeams on its inside originally shaped like a &quot;Z&quot;. On February 19, 1969, at X&#x27;s request to coincide with his name, Handyman Negri installed two wooden blocks within the crossbeams, giving it its well-known &quot;X&quot; shape. 
* Museum-Go-Round – A revolving round, grey structure with grey pillars, originally owned and operated by the Frogg Family. On February 10, 1969, Mr. Frogg accepted a position with the zoo in Westwood, prompting the family to find a new owner for the museum before moving from the Neighborhood of Make Believe. A couple of days later, Lady Elaine Fairchilde (then a resident of Someplace Else) impressed Mrs. Frogg with her knowledge of the museum and eagerness to become its new curator. Mrs. Frogg&#x27;s recommendation of Lady Elaine was passed by King Friday and the Frogg Family made their transfer to Westwood. On February 18, Lady Elaine moved into her new residence and installed a new red bell outside. The next day, she painted the pillars various colors with an assist from Lady Aberlin. Like the castle, The Museum seems to have an endless number of rooms, frequently designated by letters (e.g. dinosaurs are in the &quot;D&quot; room).
* Frog Pond – A stone pond resembling a fountain where Dr. and Mrs. Frogg and their son, Tadpole, lived before moving to Westwood. This was removed after the first week of color episodes and replaced by the Platypus Mound.
* Platypus Mound – A mound with six holes, which replaced the Frog Pond when the Platypus Family moved to the neighborhood.
* Grandfather Clock – An orange structure in the shape of a clock with a white flower pendulum, knocker, and yellow face without hands. Daniel Striped Tiger lives here. This is the outermost structure on the neighborhood set, and characters are never shown venturing beyond it.

===Bordering regions===
The world of the Land of Make-Believe also features several other &quot;regions.&quot; Along with King Friday&#x27;s realm, there are also bordering territories including:

* The City of Westwood – West of the Neighborhood, half-a-day&#x27;s walk from The Neighborhood of Make Believe and quarter-a-day&#x27;s walk from Someplace Else. According to Mr. Aber, the region didn&#x27;t have enough water supply for a swimming pool. The former Miss Sara Saturday was a resident of Westwood prior to her marriage to His Majesty King Friday XIII and her concurrent ennoblement as Queen Consort.
* The City of Southwood – South of the Neighborhood where Betty and James live.
* The Area of Northwood – Northwood is considered goat country and is north of the Neighborhood.
* Someplace Else – North of the neighborhood and south of Northwood where Donkey Hodie and Harriet Cow live. Located here is the schoolhouse where Daniel, Ana Platypus, and Prince Tuesday are students. The setting of the show &quot;Donkey Hodie&quot;.
* Land of Allmine – Lloyd Allmine&#x27;s home. It was later turned into a museum.

===Planet Purple===
Characters also frequently interact with the inhabitants of Planet Purple, where everything and everyone are purple and exactly the same. Every girl on Planet Purple is named &quot;Pauline&quot; and every boy is named &quot;Paul.&quot; Purple Panda, a resident of Planet Purple, can return there &quot;the purple way&quot; (just by thinking). Moreover, all of the planet&#x27;s inhabitants speak monotonously, often intoning, &quot;We are people from the planet purple.&quot; Inhabitants of Planet Purple are forbidden to sit in rocking chairs and, if they do, they are not allowed to return home. In one visit to the Neighborhood, Purple Panda sits in one of Cornflake S. Pecially&#x27;s rocking chairs. However, with the help of the rest of the Neighbors, it is agreed that sitting in rocking chairs is an acceptable activity for all people, and Purple Panda is allowed to return home. Planet Purple was discovered by Lady Elaine Fairchilde.

<text>The Forme of Cury (&quot;The Method of Cooking&quot;, from Old French , &#x27;cookery&#x27;) is an extensive 14th-century collection of medieval English recipes. Although the original manuscript is lost, the text appears in nine manuscripts, the most famous in the form of a scroll with a headnote citing it as the work of &quot;the chief Master Cooks of King Richard II&quot;. The name &quot;The Forme of Cury&quot; is generally used for the family of recipes rather than any single manuscript text. It is among the oldest extant English cookery books, and the earliest known to mention olive oil, gourds, and spices such as mace and cloves.

== Context ==

The collection was named &quot;The Forme of Cury&quot; by Samuel Pegge, who published an edition of one of the manuscripts in 1780 for a trustee of the British Museum, Gustavus Brander. It is one of the best-known medieval guides to cooking. &quot;The Forme of Cury&quot; may have been written partly to compete with &quot;Le Viandier of Taillevent&quot;, a French cookery book created at about the same time. This supports the idea that banquets were a symbol of power and prestige for medieval lords and kings.

== Approach ==

In the preamble, the authors explain that the recipes are meant to teach a cook how to make common dishes and unusual or extravagant banquet dishes. They also note that the recipes were written with the advice of the best experts in medicine and philosophy.
&quot;The Forme of Cury&quot; is the first known English cookery book to mention some ingredients such as cloves, olive oil, mace and gourds. Many recipes contain what were then rare and valuable spices, such as nutmeg, ginger, pepper, cinnamon and cardamom. In addition to imparting flavour, many of the spices called for were included specifically to impart rich colouring to the finished dishes for the purpose of, as Pegge says, &quot;gratifying the sight&quot;. There is a particular emphasis on yellows, reds and greens, but gilding and silvering were also used in several of the recipes. Yellow was achieved with saffron or egg yolk, red with &quot;sanders&quot; (sandalwood) or alkanet, and green often with minced parsley. There are recipes for preparing many types of animal meat, including whale, crane, curlew, heron, seal and porpoise. There are about ten vegetable recipes, including one for a vinaigrette salad, which indicates influence from Portugal and Spain, as French cooks rarely used vegetables at that time. There are also several pasta dishes, evidence of Italian influence.

Some recipes in &quot;The Forme of Cury&quot; appear to have been influenced by the &quot;Liber de Coquina&quot;, which had contributions from Arabic cuisine. For example, the recipe for (see illustration) corresponds to the Arabic (a rich semolina pudding). The confectionery-like confirms the connection with Sicily (which had been Arab, Catalan and Norman), as it uses the Arab technique of cooking in soft ball syrup.

== Sample recipes ==

=== &quot;Sawse madame&quot; ===

In modern English:

=== &quot;Makerouns&quot; ===

&quot;The Forme of Cury&quot; contains a cheese and pasta casserole known as &quot;makerouns&quot;, the earliest recipe for what is now known as macaroni and cheese. It was made with fresh, hand-cut pasta which was sandwiched between a mixture of melted butter and cheese. The recipe given (in Middle English) was:

In modern English:

== Modern recreations ==

The Café at the Rylands, in Manchester&#x27;s John Rylands Library where the manuscript is kept, cooked &quot;Tart in Ymber Day&quot;, &quot;Compast&quot;, &quot;Payn Puff&quot;, &quot;Frumenty&quot; and &quot;Gingerbrede&quot;, accompanied by Piment (spiced wine), for invited guests in 2009.

<text>Leopoldo Antonio Carrillo (; August 6, 1880 – September 10, 1961) was an American actor, vaudevillian, political cartoonist, and conservationist.
He was notable for playing Pancho in the television series &quot;The Cisco Kid&quot; (1950–1956) and in several films.

==Biography==

===Family roots===

Leo Carrillo was a member of the Carrillo family of California, a prominent Californio family, and traced his ancestry through California, Mexico, and Spain to the year 1260. His great-great grandfather José Raimundo Carrillo (1749–1809), was a soldier in the Spanish Portolá expedition colonization of Las Californias, arriving in San Diego on July 1, 1769. Franciscan Friar Junípero Serra performed the marriage ceremony for Don Jose Raimundo and Tomasa Ignacia Lugo in 1781. His great-grandfather Carlos Antonio Carrillo (1783–1852) was governor of Alta California (1837–38). His great-uncle, José Antonio Carrillo, was a three-time mayor of Los Angeles and twice married to sisters of Governor Pío Pico. His paternal grandfather, Pedro Carrillo, who was educated in Boston, was a writer.

===Early history===
The family moved from San Diego to Los Angeles then to Santa Monica, where Carrillo&#x27;s father Juan José Carrillo (1842–1916), served as the city&#x27;s police chief and later the first mayor. His cousin was Broadway star William Gaxton (real name Arturo Antonio Gaxiola). Proud of his heritage, Carrillo wrote the book &quot;The California I Love&quot;, published shortly before his death in 1961.

===Career===
A university graduate, Carrillo worked as a newspaper cartoonist for the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot;, then turned to acting on Broadway. In Hollywood, he appeared in more than 90 films, often as a dialect specialist—although in real life, he had a baritone speaking voice without a trace of an accent. He usually used the dialect for comic effect, liberally salting his speech with malaprops: &quot;My ears, they are para-loused!&quot; or &quot;Why you wanna put your dirty face in my horse&#x27;s water? I got a healthy horse and you put Germans in the water!&quot; When his screen character left any scene, Carrillo always exclaimed, &quot;Let&#x27;s went!&quot;
Leo Carrillo could play sympathetic and villainous roles with equal skill. In 1951 he took the starring role in the feature film &quot;Pancho Villa Returns&quot;, which was filmed in both English-dialogue and Spanish-dialogue versions. However, he is best remembered as Pancho, good-natured sidekick of &quot;The Cisco Kid&quot;, opposite Duncan Renaldo as Cisco. Renaldo and Carrillo were teamed for a series of feature films in 1949, and then for a syndicated television series that ran from 1950 until 1956. &quot;The Cisco Kid&quot; was notable as the first TV series filmed in color. After &quot;The Cisco Kid&quot; ended production, Carrillo appeared in the episode &quot;Rescue at Sea&quot; of the syndicated military drama &quot;Men of Annapolis&quot;.

==Civic contributions==
Carrillo was a preservationist and conservationist of long standing. When a film crew did location filming in Hilo, Hawaii in 1933, the city named one of its stately banyan trees in Carrillo&#x27;s honor; the &quot;Leo Carrillo tree&quot; still stands there today.

Carrillo served on the California Beach and Parks commission for 18 years and played a key role in the state&#x27;s acquisition of Hearst Castle at San Simeon, Los Angeles Arboretum, and Anza-Borrego Desert State Park. He eventually was made a goodwill ambassador by the California governor at the time.

As a result of his service to California, west of Malibu, California on CA-1 Pacific Coast Highway, a 1.5-mile beach is named Leo Carrillo State Park in his honor. The City of Westminster, California named an elementary school for him. Leo Carrillo Ranch Historic Park, originally Rancho de los Kiotes, in Carlsbad, California, is a registered California Historical Site. Rancho Carrillo Trail, also in Carlsbad, is named for Leo Carrillo.

==Political views==
In the early days of World War II, Carrillo advocated for the removal of all Japanese Americans from the west coast. In a telegram to Congressman Leland Ford that received extensive coverage, Carrillo wrote:
I travel every week through a hundred miles of Japanese shacks on the way to my ranch, and it seems that every farmhouse is located on some strategic elevated point. Let&#x27;s get them off the coast and into the interior. You know and I know the Japanese situation in California. The eastern people are not conscious of this menace. May I urge you in behalf of the safety of the people of California to start action at once.

Carrillo was a Republican. In 1944, for instance, he performed a &quot;Wild West&quot; act at the massive rally organized by David O. Selznick in the Los Angeles Coliseum in support of the Dewey-Bricker ticket as well as Governor Earl Warren of California, who became Dewey&#x27;s running mate in 1948 and later the Chief Justice of the United States. The gathering drew 93,000, with Cecil B. DeMille as the master of ceremonies and with short speeches by Hedda Hopper and Walt Disney. Among the others in attendance were Ann Sothern, Ginger Rogers, Randolph Scott, Adolphe Menjou, Gary Cooper, Edward Arnold, William Bendix, and Walter Pidgeon.

==Personal life==
In 1913, Carrillo married Edith Shakespeare Haeselbarth of Nyack, New York, whom he met backstage at the New York City theater where she had seen him perform. They remained together until her death in 1953. They lived in Los Alisos on Channel Road, in Santa Monica Canyon. The Carrillos had one child, a daughter, Marie Antoinette. They spent part of their time at their ranch in Carlsbad, California. Carrillo frequently permitted Boy Scout groups to camp on the grounds.

==Death==
Leo Carrillo died of cancer on September 10, 1961, at the age of 81, and is interred at Santa Monica&#x27;s Woodlawn Memorial Cemetery.

==Legacy==
For his contributions to the film industry, Leo Carrillo has a motion pictures star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1635 Vine Street, and a second star at 1517 Vine Street for his work in television. The star inspired the name of the character Horatio Carillo in the Netflix drama &quot;Narcos&quot;.

<text>Count von Count (known simply as the Count) is a Muppet character on the PBS/HBO children&#x27;s television show &quot;Sesame Street.&quot; He is meant to parody Bela Lugosi&#x27;s vampiric character, Count Dracula. His first appearance on the show was in the 4th season premiere in 1972, where he counts blocks in a sketch with Bert and Ernie.

==Description and personality==

The Count&#x27;s main role is to teach counting skills to children. His catchphrase is, &quot;Greetings! I am The Count. They call me the Count because I love to count... things&quot;. The Count loves counting so much that he will often count anything and everything regardless of size or amount, to the point of annoying other characters. The Count can occasionally lose his temper if interrupted while counting, or feel sad when there is nothing around for him to count. Apart from these, he is typically portrayed as friendly and cheerful. Once he reaches the total number of items he is counting, thunderstorms roll (even indoors or on sunny days) while he laughs his iconic &quot;Ah-Ah-Ah!&quot; staccato laugh.

The Count lives in an old cobweb-infested castle which he shares with many bats, a wolf named Yuba, and a cat named Fatatita. As a running gag, his castle has a squeaky door, which visitors always point out, only for the Count to instantly change the subject to his counting addiction. The Count drives a special car, the Countmobile, which is designed to look like a bat (cf. Batmobile).

The Count has been shown with a number of girlfriends, who tend to be vampire Countesses. These include Countess von Backwards (debuted in &quot;Sesame Street&quot; 28th season), who counts backwards, her total is indicated by a wolf howl; Countess Dahling von Dahling (debuted in the 12th season); and one simply called &quot;the Countess&quot; (first appearing in season 8). The von Count family includes an unnamed brother and mother as well as an Uncle Uno and grandparents. When the grandmother counts, it rains, and when the grandfather counts, it snows. 

The Count has a personal cloud hovering over him, which is the source of his thunder and lightning. Some residents of Sesame Street have been disturbed by it in a few episodes. For example, in episode 0974, he was counting at midnight, disturbing others, and as his punishment, the Amazing Mumford used magic to detach his cloud, therefore taking his thunder and lightning away until he understood. This episode was inspired by the 1978 &quot;Sesame Street&quot; bedtime storybook titled &quot;Who Stole the Count&#x27;s Thunder?&quot;.

According to BBC News, during an interview with the &quot;More or Less&quot; team&#x27;s Tim Harford, the Count said his favorite number is 34,969. The Count was quoted as saying, &quot;It&#x27;s a square-root thing.&quot;: 34,969 is a perfect square, being 1872.

The Count&#x27;s signature song is &quot;The Song of the Count&quot;. The song was written by Jeff Moss as a traditional Hungarian Csárdás.

==Character history==
The Count debuted on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; in Episode 0406, the premiere of Season 4 (1972–73). He was conceived by Norman Stiles, who wrote the first script. In the Count&#x27;s very first scene, Ernie told Bert to watch his pyramid of blocks and make sure nothing happened to it while he got his camera to take a picture of the pyramid. The Count then walked by, counted the blocks, and in the process, took Ernie&#x27;s pyramid apart before Bert could stop him. He then counted the blocks again, moving them back into place. Bert yelled at the Count for moving Ernie&#x27;s blocks, so the Count counted the blocks again, taking the pyramid apart. The Count was performed by Jerry Nelson, who brought the character to life. He is made out of the Large Lavender Live Hand Anything Muppet pattern.

Before a counting session, he originally greeted the viewers (and the characters) by saying, &quot;Greetings. I am the Count. They call me the Count because I LOVE to count... things.&quot; Nelson voiced the Count until his death on August 23, 2012. At that time, Matt Vogel had taken over performing the puppetry of the Count. Upon Nelson&#x27;s death, Vogel started performing both the Count&#x27;s voice and puppetry. His first performance of the Count was in a YouTube video called &quot;Counting the Yous in YouTube&quot;, a song about the celebration of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; YouTube channel reaching 1 billion views.

Despite the fact that the Count is now friendly and non-threatening, in his earliest appearances from 1972 to 1975, he showed a much more villainous nature. To begin a counting session, the Count would enter the scene holding his cape over his face in an exaggerated Lugosi-style pose before reciting his greeting, and he was often accompanied by creepy organ music. He would not even let anything interrupt him while counting, and to prevent this, he shouted &quot;SILENCE!&quot; and used hypnotic powers to temporarily stun people with a wave of his hands (although he sometimes did this without shouting anything, and even did it for no reason, occasionally). He only did this twice. In his first appearance, he hypnotized Bert before counting Ernie&#x27;s pyramid blocks, while on season 5, during a skit with Grover, the waiter, he hypnotized Grover to serve him more hot dogs to count instead of eating, leaving Grover breathless. And after counting, he would laugh maniacally, &quot;MWAH HA HA HA HA HAAAA!!!&quot;, while thunder and lightning flashed in moody colors, and then he would exit the scene, once again, holding his cape over his face. This aspect of the Count&#x27;s personality, however, was abruptly ended in 1975 out of concern that it might frighten younger viewers, and this practice was changed, as he became friendlier, did not have hypnotic powers, did not enter or exit the scene holding his cape over his face, and interacted more pleasantly with the characters (both live actors and Muppets). Also, the creepy organ music was removed, the lightning flashes were changed from moodily colored to normally colored, and his laugh was changed from a maniacal laugh to a more throaty, triumphant Lugosi-style laugh, &quot;Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!&quot;

Belvedere Castle, in New York&#x27;s Central Park, was used for exterior establishing shots of the Count&#x27;s castle on the show.

The Count made an appearance in the film &quot;The Muppets Take Manhattan&quot; at Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy&#x27;s wedding, then in the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; movies &quot;Follow That Bird&quot; (1985) as a supporting character and &quot;The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland&quot; (1999) as a minor character. The Count appeared onscreen during the closing credits of &quot;Follow That Bird,&quot; where he proceeded to read and count the credits. He also said, &quot;Hi, Mom.&quot; when a credit appears for Joan Ganz Cooney, creator of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;.

In Season 33, the Count was given a daily segment on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, simply called &quot;The Number of the Day&quot;.

The Count was originally portrayed by Jerry Nelson. However, Nelson&#x27;s health began to deteriorate in 2004, so he retired from performing all his characters except for the Count and his other &quot;Sesame Street&quot; characters. Due to his increasingly failing health, Nelson could no longer puppeteer the character of the Count, so he handed over puppeteering duties to Matt Vogel, though Nelson still continued to voice the Count. After Nelson&#x27;s death in 2012, Vogel took over voicing and puppeteering the Count full time the following year.

==In popular culture==
The St. Paul Saints, an independent minor-league baseball team in St. Paul, Minnesota, known for unique and sometimes over-the-top promotions, announced that it would give away 2,500 bobblehead dolls dressed as the Count at its May 23, 2009 game. However, instead of the Count&#x27;s regular head, this doll&#x27;s head featured Al Franken on one side and Norm Coleman on the other, and was called &quot;Count von Re-Count&quot;—referring to the extraordinarily prolonged recount and legal battle surrounding the 2008 U.S. Senate election between the two men. The team made further jabs at the election during the game.

Australian rugby league football international Anthony Minichiello has been nicknamed &quot;the Count&quot; due to his striking resemblance to the character.

During the 2020 United States presidential election, which required a ballot-counting period of four days before Joe Biden was declared the winner, the Count was featured in many internet memes and social media posts, such as playful wishes that he could be called in to assist the tabulation and the insistence that President Donald Trump&#x27;s demand to &quot;Stop the Count&quot; was hopeless against the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; character.

<doc id="239797" wikidata="Q3062488" url="?curid=239797" title="Nth Country Experiment">
<text>The &quot;N&quot;th Country Experiment was an experiment conducted by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory starting in May 1964 that sought to assess the risk of nuclear proliferation. The experiment consisted in paying three young physicists who had just received their PhDs, though they had no prior weapons experience, to develop a working nuclear weapon design, using only unclassified information, and with basic computational and technical support. &quot;The goal of the participants should be to design an explosive with a militarily significant yield&quot;, the report on the experiment read, &quot;A working context for the experiment might be that the participants have been asked to design a nuclear explosive which, if built in small numbers, would give a small nation a significant effect on their foreign relations.&quot;

The experiment ended on April 10, 1967, after three person-years of work over two and a half calendar years. According to a heavily redacted declassified version of the summary, lab weapons experts apparently judged that the team had come up with a credible design for an two-point implosion-style nuclear weapon. It was also judged likely that they would have been able to design a simpler &quot;gun combination&quot;-type weapon even more quickly, although in such a case the limiting factor in developing the weapon is not usually design difficulty but rather procurement of material (enriched uranium). 

The term &quot;&quot;Nth&quot; Country&quot; referred to the goal to assess the difficulty of developing basic weapons &quot;design&quot; (not the development of the weapons themselves) for any country with a relatively small amount of technical infrastructure—if the United States was the &quot;first&quot; country to develop nuclear weapons, and the USSR the &quot;second&quot;, and so on, which would be the &quot;nth&quot;?

Due to increased publicly available resources about nuclear weapons, it is reasonable to assume that a viable weapon design could be reached with even less effort today. But in the history of nuclear weapons, the development of fission weapons was never strongly hindered by basic design questions, except in the very first nuclear weapons programs.

The Summary Report of the Nth Country Experiment was declassified—though heavily excised—in 2003. Edited by experienced Manhattan Project and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory weapons designer James Frank—who told Dobson and Selden that they had designed a weapon comparable to that used in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima—it was originally published in 1967. The National Security Archive published additional documents in 2025.

==Summary==
In April 1964, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (then known as Livermore Radiation Laboratory) hired physicists David A. Dobson and David N. Pipkorn to design a nuclear explosive with &quot;militarily significant yield&quot;.

The next year, Pipkorn dropped out of the project and was replaced by Robert W. Seldon, a captain in the United States Army Reserve. Like Pipkorn and Dobson, Seldon had a physics PhD and no nuclear expertise.

The experiments the physicists completed were split into three phases, each representing the &quot;attainment of a physical level of understanding.&quot; Phase I was the understanding of basic concepts and considerations of bomb design, much like the process of creation originally undertaken by J. Robert Oppenheimer at Los Alamos. Phase II was the quantitative expansion of those basic concepts into practical application by calculating core mass, hole size, explosive thickness, etc., which are essential to the careful design of atomic weapons. Finally, Phase III was an &quot;extension of Phase II&quot; that involved actual implosion and fission calculations. Plutonium implosion-style designs were then formulated. 

Historical fission designs began with many-point triggers for the chemical detonation, up to a 92-point design in the Ivy King fission test. The physicists selected the more novel two-point implosion. This had first appeared in open literature in a Swedish nuclear weapon design in 1956. The Swan nuclear primary was another early two-point design, first tested in 1956. Certain aspects of the UCRL-50239, including the two-point nature of the implosion, have been omitted from the report.

<doc id="239803" wikidata="Q330574" url="?curid=239803" title="Easter egg (media)">
<text>An Easter egg is a message, image, or feature hidden in software, a video game, a film, or another—usually electronic—medium. The term used in this manner was coined around 1979 by Steve Wright, the then-Director of Software Development in the Atari Consumer Division, to describe a hidden message in the Atari video game &quot;Adventure&quot;, in reference to an Easter egg hunt.

The earliest known video game Easter egg is in the 1973 video game &quot;Moonlander&quot;, in which the player tries to land a Lunar module on the Moon; if the player opts to fly the module horizontally through several of the game&#x27;s screens, they encounter a McDonald&#x27;s restaurant, and if they land next to it, the astronaut will visit it instead of standing next to the ship. The earliest known Easter egg in software in general is one placed in the &quot;make&quot; command for PDP-6/PDP-10 computers sometime in October 1967–October 1968, wherein if the user attempts to create a file named &quot;love&quot; by typing &quot;make love&quot;, the program responds &quot;not war?&quot; before proceeding.

==Origin==

The use of the term &quot;Easter egg&quot; to describe secret features in video games originates from the 1980 video game &quot;Adventure&quot; for the Atari 2600 game console, programmed by the employee Warren Robinett. At the time, Atari did not include programmers&#x27; names in the game credits, both to prevent competitors from poaching its developers as well as to deny developers a means to bargain with the management of the new owners, Warner Communications. Robinett, who disagreed with his supervisor over this lack of acknowledgment, secretly programmed the message &quot;Created by Warren Robinett&quot; to appear only if a player moves their avatar over a specific pixel (dubbed the &quot;Gray Dot&quot;) during a certain part of the game and enters a previously &quot;forbidden&quot; part of the map where the message can be found. When Robinett left Atari, he did not inform the company of the acknowledgment that he included in the game. Shortly after his departure, the &quot;Gray Dot&quot; and his message were discovered by a player. Atari&#x27;s management initially wanted to remove the message and release the game again, until this was deemed too costly. Instead, Steve Wright, the Director of Software Development in the Atari Consumer Division, suggested that they keep the message and, in fact, encourage the inclusion of such messages in future games, describing them as Easter eggs for consumers to find.

==In video games==
While Robinett&#x27;s message in &quot;Adventure&quot; led to the first use of the phrase &quot;Easter egg&quot;, Easter eggs were included in previous video games. The earliest known video game Easter egg is in &quot;Moonlander&quot; (1973), in which the player tries to land a spaceship on the Moon. If the player flies far enough horizontally, they encounter a McDonald&#x27;s restaurant, and if they land next to it, an astronaut will visit it instead of standing next to the ship. Other early known Easter eggs include one in the first text adventure game, &quot;Colossal Cave Adventure&quot; (1976), from which &quot;Adventure&quot; was fashioned, which includes several secret words. One of these is &quot;xyzzy&quot;, a command which enables the player to move between two points in the game world. According to research by Ed Fries, one of the earliest Easter eggs in a graphical video games could be found in &quot;Starship 1&quot; (1977), programmed by Ron Milner. By triggering the cabinet&#x27;s controls in the right order, the player can have the message &quot;Hi Ron!&quot; appear on the screen. Fries describes it as &quot;the earliest arcade game yet known that clearly meets the definition of an Easter egg&quot;. The existence of this Easter egg was not published until 2017, leading Fries to suggest that, as more than one hundred arcade games predate &quot;Starship 1&quot;, earlier Easter eggs may still be undiscovered. Fries says that some Atari arcade cabinets were resold under the Kee Games label and include changes to the hardware that make the game appear different from the Atari version. &quot;Anti-Aircraft II&quot; (1975) includes a means to modify the circuit board to make the airplanes in the game appear as alien UFOs. Fries surmises that this feature may have been intended for a Kee Games release. For this reason, and because it requires a hardware modification, Fries questions whether it meets the definition of an Easter egg. In 2004, an Easter egg displaying programmer Bradley Reid-Selth&#x27;s surname was found in &quot;Video Whizball&quot; (1978), a game for the Fairchild Channel F system.

Since &quot;Adventure&quot;, there has been a long history of video game developers placing Easter eggs in their games. Most Easter eggs are intentional—an attempt to communicate with the player or a way of getting even with management for a perceived slight. Easter eggs in video games take a variety of forms, from purely ornamental screens to aesthetic enhancements that change some element of the game during play. The Easter egg included in the original &quot;Age of Empires&quot; (1997) is an example of the latter; catapult projectiles are changed from stones to cows.

More elaborate Easter eggs include secret levels and developers&#x27; rooms—fully functional, hidden areas of the game. Developers&#x27; rooms often include inside jokes from the fandom or development team and differ from a debug room in that they are specifically intended for the player to find. Some games even include hidden minigames as Easter eggs. In the LucasArts game &quot;Day of the Tentacle&quot; (1993), the original &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot; (1987) game can be played in its full version by using a home computer in a character&#x27;s room. Similarly, a programmer included the whole of &quot;TimeSplitters 2&quot; (2002) within &quot;&quot; (2016), accessed by using a special code at an in-game arcade cabinet.

Other Easter eggs originated unintentionally. The Konami Code, a type of cheat code, became an intentional Easter egg in most games, but it originated from Konami&#x27;s &quot;Gradius&quot; (1985) for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The programmer, Kazuhisa Hashimoto, created the code as a means to rapidly debug the game by giving the player&#x27;s avatar additional health and powers to easily traverse the game. These types of codes are normally removed from the game before it is shipped but, in the case of &quot;Gradius&quot;, Hashimoto forgot to remove it and the code was soon discovered by players. Its popularity inspired Konami to reuse the code and purposely retain it for many of its future games as an Easter egg.

Technical issues may also create unintentional Easter eggs. Jon Burton, founder of Traveller&#x27;s Tales, said that many seemingly apparent Easter eggs in their Sega Genesis games came about as a result of introducing programming tricks to get around some of the difficulty they had in getting Sega&#x27;s strict certification for their games, catching any exceptions during execution to bring the game back to a usable state as to pass certification. For example, hitting the side of the &quot;Sonic 3D Blast&quot; (1996) cartridge while it is slotted in the console will bring the game back to the Level Select screen, which Burton explains is the default exception handling for any unidentified processor error, such as when connectivity between the cartridge and the console&#x27;s microprocessor is temporarily lost.

==In computing==
===Software===

In computer software, Easter eggs are secret responses that occur as a result of an undocumented set of commands. The results can vary from a simple printed message or image to a page of programmer credits or a small video game hidden inside an otherwise serious piece of software.

In the TOPS-10 operating system (for the DEC PDP-10 mainframe computer), the command is used to invoke the TECO editor to create a file. If given the file name argument , so that the command reads , it will pause and respond  before creating the file. The Easter egg was added sometime between October 1967 and October 1968 by William F. Weiher at the Stanford AI Lab to the COMPIL program for the PDP-6, which was then used in the TOPS-10 operating system, making it the first Easter egg in a software program. This same behavior occurs on the RSTS/E operating system, where TECO will provide this response. Other Unix operating systems respond to &quot; with &quot; (a reference to &quot;The Prisoner&quot; in Berkeley Unix, 1977).

Some versions of the DEC OpenVMS operating system have concealed exit status codes, including a reference to the Monty Python Dirty Hungarian Phrasebook skit; &quot;&quot; returns the message &quot;%SYSTEM-W-FISH, my hovercraft is full of eels&quot; while &quot;&quot; returns a reference to an early Internet meme: &quot;%SYSTEM-F-GAMEOVER, All your base are belong to us&quot;.

Easter eggs in the 1997 version of Microsoft Office include a hidden flight simulator in Microsoft Excel and a pinball game in Microsoft Word. Since 2002, Microsoft does not allow any hidden or undocumented code as part of its trustworthy computing initiative.

The Debian operating system&#x27;s package tool apt-get has an Easter egg involving an ASCII cow when variants on are typed into the shell.

An Easter egg is found on all Microsoft Windows operating systems before XP. In the 3D Text screen saver, entering the text &quot;volcano&quot; will display the names of all the volcanoes in the United States. Microsoft removed this Easter egg in XP but added others. In Windows Vista and later, by launching a screensaver executable (introduced with Windows Vista) on the command line with the codice_1 flag, for example launching the &quot;bubbles&quot; screen saver with codice_2 command-line parameter, it runs as desktop wallpaper. Microsoft Excel 95 contains a hidden action game similar to &quot;Doom&quot; (1993) called &quot;The Hall of Tortured Souls&quot;.

The Google search engine famously contains many Easter eggs, given to the user in response to certain search queries.

Steve Jobs banned Easter eggs from Apple products upon his return to the company. The first Easter egg to appear after his death is in a 2012 update to the Mac App Store for OS X Mountain Lion, in which downloaded apps are temporarily timestamped as &quot;24 January 1984&quot;, the date of the sales launch of the original Macintosh.

The Python programming language and its ecosystem of libraries include various Easter eggs.

===Firmware===
While computer-related Easter eggs are often found in installed software, occasionally they exist in the firmware of certain devices. On some home and early personal computers the ROM contains Easter eggs, including lists of the developers&#x27; names, political exhortations, snatches of music, or images of the entire development team.

The palmtop PC HP 200LX (1994) includes an undocumented hex calculator HEXCALC.EXM. The built-in maze game &quot;Lair of Squid&quot; incorporates a hidden gallery of the software developers. In test mode it displays several poems.

Other notable examples include some versions of the AMI BIOS that on 13 November 1993, proceeded to play &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; via the PC speaker repeatedly instead of booting, as well as several early Apple Macintosh models that have photos of the development team in the ROM. These Mac Easter eggs were well-publicized in the Macintosh press at the time along with the means to access them, and were later recovered by an NYC Resistor team, a hacker collective, through elaborate reverse engineering. Similarly, the Radio Shack Color Computer 3&#x27;s ROM contains code which displays what looks like three Microware developers on a ++ keypress sequence—a hard reset which discards any information currently in RAM.

Several oscilloscopes contain Easter eggs. One example is the HP 54600B, known to have a &quot;Tetris&quot; (1985) clone, and the HP 54622D contains an imitation of the &quot;Asteroids&quot; (1979) game named &quot;Rocks&quot;. Another is the Tektronix 1755A Vector and Waveform Monitor which displays swimming fish when Remote &gt; Software version is selected on the CONFIG menu.

In the second and third hardware revision of the Minolta Dynax/Maxxum/Alpha 9 (introduced in 1998) SLR camera, including all SSM/ADI upgraded bodies (since 2003), an undocumented button sequence can be utilized to reconfigure the camera to behave like the Dynax/Maxxum/Alpha 9Ti (1999) and subsequently invoke support for the limited model&#x27;s extra functions also in the black model.

One of HP&#x27;s electronic pocket calculators, the HP-45 (introduced in 1973), has a built-in undocumented stopwatch.

The firmware of HP&#x27;s ScanJet 5p image scanner contains an easter egg wherein, on a cold power-on, holding down the scan button when the SCSI ID selector on the back is set to &quot;0&quot; will cause the ScanJet to play a rendition of Schiller&#x27;s &quot;Ode to Joy&quot;, by modulating the speed of the audible stepper motor drive to produce specific pitches.

===Hardware===
The Commodore Amiga 1000 computer includes the signatures of the design and development team embossed on the inside of the case, including Jay Miner and the paw print of his dog, Mitchy. The Commodore Amiga models 500, 600, and 1200 each feature Easter eggs in the form of song titles by the B-52&#x27;s as white printing on the motherboards. The 500 says &quot;B52/Rock Lobster&quot;, the 600 says &quot;June Bug&quot;, and the 1200 says &quot;Channel Z&quot;. The Amiga OS software contains hidden messages.

Many integrated circuit (chip) designers have included hidden graphics elements termed chip art, including images, phrases, developer initials, logos, and more. This artwork, like the rest of the chip, is reproduced in each copy by lithography and etching. These are visible only when the chip package is opened and examined under magnification. The 1984 CVAX microchip implementation of the MicroVAX CPU contains in its etchings the Russian phrase in the Cyrillic alphabet &quot;VAX: When you care enough to steal the very best&quot;, placed there because, &quot;knowing that some CVAXs would end up in the USSR, the team wanted the Russians to know that we were thinking of them&quot;.

Another notable example is the pro controller for the Nintendo Switch, on the controller&#x27;s motherboard, if a player holds down on the right stick and looks closely into the transparent plastic surrounding its socket while shining a light on it, there is a hidden message that reads &quot;THX2ALLGAMEFANS!&quot;. The message was discovered by Japanese Twitter user Geo Stream on March 4, 2017, one day after the Switch&#x27;s launch.

==Comics==
American comic book artists are known to include hidden messages in their art:

* In a reprint of classic &quot;Captain America&quot; comics, a production artist drew a penis on Bucky Barnes.
* In 2000, Al Milgrom inserted a message into &quot;Universe X: Spidey&quot; #1 insulting his previous boss, Marvel Editor in Chief Bob Harras, following Harras&#x27; termination from Marvel Comics. On Page 28, panel 3, the spines of books on a bookshelf in the background read, &quot;HARRAS HA HA, HE&#x27;S GONE, GOOD RIDDANCE TO BAD RUBBISH HE WAS A NASTY S.O.B.&quot; The message was spotted after the book was printed but before it went on sale; the copies that were printed for consumers were destroyed. However, 4,000 preview copies were distributed to retailers as part of a &quot;First Look&quot; deal, and these are today considered rare collectors&#x27; items. Milgrom was &quot;apparently fired and allegedly (and quietly) re-hired several weeks later&quot;.
* Ethan Van Sciver hid the word &quot;sex&quot; in the background of nearly every page of &quot;New X-Men&quot; #118 (November 2001). Van Sciver subsequently stated that he hid the word throughout the book because he was annoyed with Marvel at the time for reasons he cannot remember, and thought it would be fun to engage in some mischief with his work.
* Indonesian artist Ardian Syaf is known to engage in the practice of hiding Easter egg references to political figures in the backgrounds of his artwork. In &quot;Batgirl&quot; (vol. 4) #9 (July 2012), Syaf included a storefront sign that referenced the President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, although the text that accompanies the image of Widodo is covered by a caption. In April 2017, he caused an outcry by placing Easter egg references to the November 2016 Jakarta protests into the pages of &quot;X-Men Gold&quot; #1, which were perceived by readers to be anti-Semitic and anti-Christian. Though Syaf acknowledged the political nature of the messages, he stated that they were not intended to express any anti-Semitic nor anti-Christian sentiment on his part. In response to these Easter eggs, Marvel terminated their contract with Syaf.

===Home media===
Easter eggs are found on films, DVDs, and Blu-ray Discs, often as deleted scenes or bonus features. Klinger states that their presence is &quot;another signifier of artistry in the world of DVD supplements.&quot; According to American film critics James Berardinelli and Roger Ebert, most DVDs do not contain them and most examples are &quot;inconsequential&quot;, but a few, such as the one found on the &quot;Memento&quot; DVD release, are &quot;worth the effort to seek out&quot;.
===Broadcast media===
Unlike DVDs and computer games, broadcast radio and television programs contain no executable code. Easter eggs may still appear in the content itself, such as a hidden Mickey in a Disney film or a real telephone number instead of a 555 fictitious telephone number. A 2014 Super Bowl advertisement was leaked online in which a lady gives a man a real telephone number, which the advertiser had hidden as a marketing ploy; the first caller to the number received a pair of tickets to the game. The 1980s animated series &quot;She-Ra: Princess of Power&quot; featured a character named Loo-Kee who typically appeared once per episode, hidden in a single screenshot. At the end of the episode, the screenshot would be shown again and Loo-Kee would challenge viewers to locate him before revealing his hiding place. &quot;Adventure Time&quot; also had a character known as The Snail that was hidden in almost every episode of the show.

More recent broadcast media, where viewers have access to high-resolution digital copies or streaming services, may include further Easter eggs that can only be found by freezing the show at certain points. In the anthology series &quot;Black Mirror&quot;, the producers have included Easter eggs that reference past episodes, or tie into future episodes, as a means of loosely tying together all episodes into a single &quot;Black Mirror&quot; universe. The opening credits of Season 2 of the animated series &quot;&quot; feature Easter eggs that foreshadows the episode. They generally could only be found by pausing the sequence at certain points. Consequently, the introductions to each episode of the season slightly differs from each other. The Netflix series &quot;Stranger Things&quot; had a real-world Easter Egg where a pizza delivery van featured in the show&#x27;s fourth season had the phone number (805) 45-PIZZA shown on its side. If that number, which translated to 805-457-4992 was dialed, it led to a special message from Argyle, the fictional restaurant&#x27;s delivery driver.

==Security concerns==
Security author Michel E. Kabay discussed security concerns of Easter eggs in 2000, saying that, while software quality assurance requires that all code be tested, it is not known whether Easter eggs are. He said that, as they tend to be held as programming secrets from the rest of the product testing process, a &quot;logic bomb&quot; could also bypass testing. Kabay asserts that this undermined the Trusted Computing Base, a paradigm of trustworthy hardware and software in place since the 1980s, and is of concern wherever personal or confidential information is stored, as this may then be vulnerable to damage or manipulation. Microsoft created some of the largest and most elaborate Easter eggs, such as those in Microsoft Office. In 2005, Larry Osterman of Microsoft acknowledged Microsoft Easter eggs, and his involvement in development of one, but described them as &quot;irresponsible&quot;, and wrote that the company&#x27;s operating system division &quot;has a &#x27;no Easter Eggs&#x27; policy&quot; as part of its Trustworthy Computing initiative.

In 2006, Douglas W. Jones said that while &quot;some Easter eggs may be intentional tools used to detect illegal copying, others are clearly examples of unauthorized functionality that has slipped through the quality-control tests at the vendor&quot;. While hidden Easter eggs themselves are harmless, it may be possible for malware to be hidden in similar ways in voting machines or other computers.

Netscape Navigator contributor Jamie Zawinski stated in an interview in 1998 that harmless Easter eggs impose a negligible burden on shipped software, and serve the important purpose of helping productivity by keeping programmers happy.

==Contemporary works about Easter eggs==

Easter eggs have become more widely known to the general public and are referenced in contemporary artworks.
* In the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;Blink&quot;, the existence of video Easter eggs across seventeen DVDs leads to solving the protagonists&#x27; dilemma.
* In Ernest Cline&#x27;s novel &quot;Ready Player One&quot; and its film adaptation, the protagonists are competing with others to find various Easter eggs within a large virtual reality environment. The final challenge includes identifying and reaching the Easter egg from the Atari &quot;Adventure&quot; game.

<text>The World English Bible (WEB) is an English translation of the Bible freely shared online. The translation work began in 1994 and was deemed complete in 2020. Created by Michael Paul Johnson with help from volunteers, the WEB is an updated revision of the American Standard Version from 1901.

The WEB has several versions available on its website, including both American and British styles of English. Another important distinction is two types of Old Testament: one limited to protocanon, while the other includes apocrypha.

==History==
In 1994, Michael Paul Johnson felt commissioned by God &quot;to create a new modern English translation of the Holy Bible that would be forever free to use, publish, and distribute.&quot; As he did not have any formal training in this regard, he studied Greek and Hebrew, as well as how to use scholarly works. His first translated books were the gospel and letters of John. The drafts were shared on Usenet and a mailing list, where he received several suggestions from others and incorporated them. Estimating he would be 150 years old by the time this style of work would be finished, Johnson decided to base further work on the American Standard Version (ASV) of 1901, which is regarded as an accurate translation and is wholly in the public domain.

Johnson&#x27;s main goal became modernizing the language of ASV. He created custom computer programs to organize this process, resulting in the initial draft of 1997 which &quot;was not quite modern English, in that it still lacked quotation marks and still had some word ordering that sounded more like Elizabethan English or maybe Yoda than modern English.&quot; This draft was soon named World English Bible (WEB), as Johnson intended it to be for any English speaker, while the acronym indicates that the Web is its means of distribution.

Over the years, numerous volunteers have assisted Johnson. The entire translation effort was deemed complete in 2020, but relatively minor changes are still made.

==Features==

The translation philosophy of the WEB is to be mostly formally equivalent, like the American Standard Version it is based on, but with modernized English. There are a modest amount of footnotes for cross-references and brief translation notes.

The WEB originally followed the ASV&#x27;s decision to transliterate the Tetragrammaton, but used &quot;Yahweh&quot; instead of &quot;Jehovah&quot; throughout the Old Testament. However, this was relegated to the &quot;Classic&quot; version of the WEB; all other versions now use the word &quot;LORD&quot;.

===WEB and ASV comparison===
==Licensing==
All of the text of the World English Bible is dedicated to the public domain. The ebible.org project maintains a trademark on the phrase &quot;World English Bible&quot; and forbids any derivative work that substantially alters the text from using the name &quot;World English Bible&quot; to describe it. The reasons given were that they felt copyright was an ineffective way of protecting the text&#x27;s integrity and the fact that the Creative Commons licenses did not exist at the time the project began.

==Critical reception==

The Provident Planning website uses the World English Bible because it is free of copyright restrictions and because the author considers it to be a good translation.

The Bible Megasite review of the World English Bible says it is a good revision of the American Standard Version of 1901 (ASV) into contemporary English, which also corrects some textual issues with the ASV.

The World English Bible is widely published in digital formats by a variety of publishers.

<doc id="239807" wikidata="Q2373406" url="?curid=239807" title="Windlass">
<text>The windlass is an apparatus for moving heavy weights. Typically, a windlass consists of a horizontal cylinder (barrel), which is rotated by the turn of a crank or belt. A winch is affixed to one or both ends, and a cable or rope is wound around the winch, pulling a weight attached to the opposite end. The Greek scientist Archimedes was the inventor of the windlass. A surviving medieval windlass, dated to –1400, is in the Church of St Mary and All Saints, Chesterfield. The oldest depiction of a windlass for raising water can be found in the Book of Agriculture published in 1313 by the Chinese official Wang Zhen of the Yuan Dynasty ( 1290–1333).

==Uses==
* Vitruvius, a military engineer writing about 28 BC, defined a machine as &quot;a combination of timber fastened together, chiefly efficacious in moving great weights&quot;. About a century later, Hero of Alexandria summarized the practice of his day by naming the &quot;five simple machines&quot; for &quot;moving a given weight by a given force&quot; as the lever, windlass, screw for power, wedge, and tackle block (pulley). Until nearly the end of the nineteenth century it was held that these &quot;five mechanical powers&quot; were the building blocks from which all more complex assemblages were constructed.
* During the Middle Ages the windlass was used to raise materials for the construction of buildings such as in Chesterfield&#x27;s crooked spire church.
* A windlass cocking mechanism on crossbows was used as early as 1215 in England, and most European crossbows had one by the Late Middle Ages.
* Windlasses are sometimes used on boats to raise the anchor as an alternative to a vertical capstan (see anchor windlass).
* The handle used to open locks on the UK&#x27;s inland waterways is called a windlass.
* Windlass can be used to raise water from a well. The oldest description of a well windlass, a rotating wooden rod installed across the mouth of a well, is found in Isidore of Seville&#x27;s ( 560–636) &quot;Origenes&quot; (XX, 15, 1–3).
* Windlass have also been used in gold mining. A windlass would be constructed above a shaft which allowed heavy buckets to be hauled up to the surface. This process would be used until the shaft got below 40 metres deep, when the windlass would be replaced by a &quot;whip&quot; or a &quot;whim&quot;.

==Differential windlass==
In a differential windlass, also called a Chinese windlass, there are two coaxial drums of different radii &quot;r&quot; and &quot;r′&quot;. The rope is wound onto one drum while it unwinds from the other, with a movable pulley hanging in the bight between the drums. Since each turn of the crank raises the pulley and attached weight by only , very large mechanical advantages can be obtained.

==Spanish windlass==
A Spanish windlass is a device for tightening a rope or cable by twisting it using a stick as a lever. The rope or cable is looped around two points so that it is fixed at either end. The stick is inserted into the loop and twisted, tightening the rope and pulling the two points toward each other. It is commonly used to move a heavy object such as a pipe or a post a short distance. It can be an effective device for pulling cars or cattle out of mud. A Spanish windlass is sometimes used to tighten a tourniquet or a straitjacket. A Spanish windlass trap can be used to kill small game. An 1898 report to the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations about an American vessel captured by a Spanish gunboat described the Spanish windlass as a torture device. One of the captives&#x27; wrists were tied together. The captor then twisted a stick in the rope until it tightened and caused the man&#x27;s wrists to swell.

<text>Pope John XIX (; died October 1032), born Romanus, was the Bishop of Rome and ruler of the Papal States from 1024 to his death. He belonged to the family of the powerful Counts of Tusculum, succeeding his brother, Benedict VIII. Papal relations with the Patriarchate of Constantinople soured during John XIX&#x27;s pontificate. He was a supporter of Emperor Conrad II and patron of the musician Guido of Arezzo.

==Family==
Romanus was born in Rome. He was the third son of Count Gregory I of Tusculum and his wife, Mary. During the pontificate of his brother, Benedict VIII, Romanus held temporal power in the city as consul and senator. Upon the death of Benedict, Romanus, a layman, was elected to succeed him. He was immediately ordained in all the orders in succession, and consecrated bishop in order to enable him to ascend the papal chair. He took the name of John.

== Papacy==
John XIX played a role in the process leading to the Schism of 1054 by rejecting a proposal by Patriarch Eustathius of Constantinople to recognise that patriarchate&#x27;s sphere of interest in the east. Against the grain of ecclesiastical history, John XIX agreed, upon being paid a large bribe, to recognize the patriarch of Constantinople&#x27;s claim to the title of ecumenical bishop. However, this proposal excited general indignation throughout the Church, immediately compelling him to withdraw from the agreement.

John invited the celebrated musician, Guido of Arezzo, to visit Rome and explain the musical notation invented by him. He encouraged the Benedictine to instruct the Roman clergy in music.

On the death of the Emperor Henry II in 1024, John gave his support to Emperor Conrad II, who along with his wife, Gisela of Swabia, was crowned with great pomp at St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica on Easter of 1027. Two kings, Rudolph III of Burgundy and Cnut the Great of Denmark and England, took part in this journey to Rome. Consistent with his role as a Christian king, Cnut went to Rome to repent for his sins, to pray for redemption and the security of his subjects, and to improve the conditions for pilgrims, as well as merchants, on the road to Rome. Rudolph had control of many of the toll gates. Negotiations being successful, the solemn word of the pope, Conrad and Rudolph was given with the witness of four archbishops, twenty bishops, and &quot;innumerable multitudes of dukes and nobles&quot;, suggesting it was before the ceremonies were completed. In 1025 he sent the crown to Poland and blessed the coronation of the Polish king Bolesław I the Brave.

On 6 April 1027, John held a Lateran synod in which he declared for the patriarch of Aquileia against the patriarch of Grado, giving its bishop, Poppo of Aquileia, the patriarchal dignity and putting the bishop of Grado under his jurisdiction. In fact, the patriarch took precedence over all Italian bishops. In 1029, John revoked his decision and reaffirmed all the dignities of Grado. John also enacted a papal bull endowing Archbishop Byzantius of Bari with the right to consecrate his own twelve suffragans after the reattachment of the Bariot diocese to Rome in 1025. This was part of a conciliatory agreement with Eustathius, whereby the existence of the Byzantine Rite would be allowed in Italy in exchange for the establishment of churches celebrating the Latin liturgical rites in Constantinople.

Pope John XIX took the Cluny Abbey under his protection, and renewed its privileges in spite of the protests of Goslin, bishop of Macon. He offered Odilo of Cluny the archbishopric of Lyons, but Odilo refused and the pope then chided Odilo for disobedience. John XIX died shortly after. He was said to have been killed by a mob of angry peasants, but there is no direct evidence to support this. His nephew Benedict IX was selected to succeed him, although he was still young; according to some sources, he was only 12, but he was more likely to have been about 18 or 20.

==Family tree==
John XIX was closely related to five other popes who reigned in the 10th and 11th centuries, as well as some of the most powerful rulers of Italy at the time.

<text>Boston College (BC) is a private Catholic Jesuit research university in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, United States. Founded in 1863 by the Society of Jesus, the university has more than 15,000 total students. 

The university offers bachelor&#x27;s degrees, master&#x27;s degrees, and doctoral degrees through its eight colleges and schools. Its main campus is a historic district and features some of the earliest examples of collegiate gothic architecture in North America. The campus is 6 miles west of downtown Boston.

Boston College athletic teams are the Eagles. Their colors are maroon and gold and their mascot is Baldwin the Eagle. The Eagles compete in NCAA Division I as members of the Atlantic Coast Conference in all sports offered by the ACC. The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s ice hockey teams compete in Hockey East. Boston College&#x27;s men&#x27;s ice hockey team has won five national championships.

Alumni and affiliates of the university include governors, ambassadors, members of Congress, scholars, writers, medical researchers, Hollywood actors, and professional athletes. Boston College alumni include three Rhodes, 22 Truman, and 171 Fulbright scholars.

==History==
===Early history===
Boston College was founded through the efforts of the first Jesuit community in New England, which was established at St. Mary&#x27;s Church in Boston in 1849. Jesuit priest John McElroy maintained the vision for what became BC, recognizing the need for an educational institution for the Irish Catholic immigrant population. With the approval of his Jesuit superiors, McElroy raised funds and purchased land for &quot;The Boston College&quot; on Harrison Avenue in the Hudson neighborhood of South End, Boston, Massachusetts, in 1857. 

On April 1, 1863, the college was granted a university charter by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, allowing the Board of Trustees to confer degrees typically awarded by colleges in the state. Reverend John Bapst, S.J., served as the first President of BC and launched the collegiate instruction program on September 5, 1864. 

The average age of students in its early years was fourteen, indicating a strong presence of high schoolers, which aligned with the Society of Jesuits&#x27;s preparatory tradition from Europe. The student body consisted mainly of local boys from greater Boston parishes, some of whom received scholarships, while campus life focused heavily on religious activities, requiring Catholic students to attend Mass, partake in confession, and join devotional societies. The curriculum was based on the Jesuit &quot;Ratio Studiorum&quot;, emphasizing Latin, Greek, philosophy, and theology.

Expansion of the South End buildings onto James Street enabled increased separation between the high school and college divisions, though Boston College High School remained a constituent part of Boston College until 1927, when it was separately incorporated. 

===Move to Chestnut Hill===
In 1907, newly installed President Thomas I. Gasson, S.J., determined that BC&#x27;s cramped, urban quarters in Boston&#x27;s South End were inadequate and unsuited for significant expansion. Inspired by John Winthrop&#x27;s early vision of Boston as a &quot;city upon a hill&quot;, he re-imagined Boston College as a beacon of Jesuit scholarship. Less than a year after taking office, he purchased Amos Adams Lawrence&#x27;s farm on Chestnut Hill, six miles (10 km) west of downtown. He organized an international competition for the design of a campus master plan and set about raising funds for the construction of the &quot;new&quot; university. Construction began in 1909. 

By 1913, construction costs had surpassed available funds, and, as a result, Gasson Hall, &quot;New BC&#x27;s&quot; main building, stood alone on Chestnut Hill for its first three years. While Maginnis&#x27;s ambitious plans were never fully realized, BC&#x27;s first &quot;capital campaign&quot;—which included a large replica of Gasson Hall&#x27;s clock tower set up on Boston Common to measure the fundraising progress—ensured that President Gasson&#x27;s vision survived. 

=== Academic expansion and co-education ===
By the 1920s, BC began to fill out the dimensions of its university charter, establishing the Boston College Graduate School of Arts &amp; Sciences, the Boston College Law School, and the Woods College of Advancing Studies, followed successively by the Boston College Graduate School of Social Work, the Carroll School of Management, the Connell School of Nursing, and the Lynch School of Education and Human Development. In 1926, Boston College conferred its first degrees on women (though it did not become fully coeducational until 1970). On April 20, 1963, an address by President John F. Kennedy, the nation&#x27;s first Catholic president who had received an honorary degree in 1956, was the highlight of a week-long centennial celebration. 

=== Monan&#x27;s presidency and institutional expansion ===
When J. Donald Monan, S.J. began his presidency on September 5, 1972, Boston College faced significant financial challenges, including a $30 million debt and a frozen salary structure for faculty and staff. During his tenure, the Boston College Board of Trustees was restructured to include lay alumni and business leaders, moving away from its traditional composition of Society of Jesus members. In 1973, Monan appointed Frank B. Campanella as BC’s first executive vice president, focusing on fiscal matters and university administration. Campanella held this position until 1991. In 1974, BC adopted depreciation accounting, a novel approach at the time for universities, reflecting a more sophisticated financial strategy. BC merged with Newton College of the Sacred Heart in that same year, acquiring its 40-acre campus just 1.5 miles away, which allowed the Boston College Law School to relocate and provided much-needed housing for an increasingly residential student body.

In April 1976, BC launched a capital campaign with a goal of raising $21 million but ultimately secured $25 million. By 1982, the university had enjoyed a decade of financial stability, with an endowment of $36 million by the end of the 1981-82 academic year. Following an aggressive capital campaign in 1989 that raised $136 million, the endowment reached $250 million, surpassed $350 million in 1992, and exceeded $500 million by 1995. When Monan transitioned to University Chancellor in 1996, the endowment had grown to $590 million.

===Continued growth and development ===

Under the presidency of William P. Leahy, S.J., which began after Monan&#x27;s tenure, Boston College experienced significant growth and development. In 2002, Leahy initiated the Church in the 21st Century program, addressing issues facing the Catholic Church in light of the clergy sexual abuse scandal, which positioned BC as a leader in advocating for Church reform. Plans to merge with the Weston Jesuit School of Theology furthered the university&#x27;s ambition to be a leading intellectual center for Catholic theology in the United States. 
In 2007, BC announced a $1.6 billion master plan for campus revitalization over ten years, aiming to enhance facilities and hire new faculty. While the plan received mixed reactions from city officials, it marked a significant step toward expanding the university&#x27;s capabilities. By June 10, 2009, the Boston College Master Plan was approved by city authorities, allowing the university to enter the design and planning phases for its ambitious development projects. Through these initiatives, Boston College has continued to adapt and evolve as a prominent institution in higher education.

==Campuses==
The Boston College campus is known generally as the &quot;Heights&quot; and to some as the &quot;Crowned Hilltop&quot; due largely to its location and presence of buildings featuring gothic towers reaching into the sky. The main campus is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The University also encompasses the Connors Family Retreat and Conference Center in Dover, Massachusetts, the Weston Observatory in Weston, Massachusetts, and various other properties in the region.

=== Chestnut Hill campus ===
Boston College&#x27;s main campus, located in Chestnut Hill, west of downtown Boston, is 175 acres and features over 120 buildings set atop a hill overlooking the Chestnut Hill Reservoir. 

The campus is accessible via the Boston College station, situated at St. Ignatius Gate. This station serves as the western terminus of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) Green Line&#x27;s B branch (also known as the &quot;Boston College&quot; line), connecting the university to downtown Boston and other destinations.

==== Other properties ====
In 2017, Boston College acquired the 24-acre Mishkan Tefila Synagogue property in Chestnut Hill, which was previously used for administrative services and event parking. The synagogue&#x27;s 806-seat auditorium has since been transformed into the university&#x27;s largest theater venue for the Robsham Theater Arts Center, alongside a ballroom-style multi-purpose room and a hexagon-shaped meeting room for various events. An outdoor quad is also available for performances and gatherings. In 2019, the City of Newton took approximately 17 wooded acres of the property through eminent domain. In 2020, Boston College further expanded its mission by acquiring Pine Manor College, a financially struggling liberal arts institution in Chestnut Hill that served a significant number of first-generation and inner-city students.

=== Newton Campus ===
In 1975, Boston College merged with Newton College of the Sacred Heart. The Centre Street campus of the Newton College has since become housing for freshman of Boston College and the current location of the Boston College Law School. Athletic fields for some of Boston College&#x27;s teams have also been constructed on Newton Campus. The campus is located 1 mile west of the main campus and is serviced by the university bus system.

===Brighton Campus===
Between 2004 and 2007, Boston College acquired of land from the Archdiocese of Boston. This included the archdiocese&#x27;s former headquarters, sold to the university in 2004 for $107,400,000. This land holds a variety of buildings for the school of theology, along with facilities for the men&#x27;s baseball and women&#x27;s softball team.

=== Brookline Campus ===
The Brookline campus is home to Messina College (formerly Pine Manor College), which includes several residence halls and other academic and athletic facilities. Messina College opened in July 2024 for over 100 first-generation college students. It offers associate degrees in applied data science, health sciences, general business, and applied psychology and human development. The college emphasizes support for underprivileged students through a residential model, small class sizes, and mentorship, preparing graduates for workforce entry or transfer to four-year institutions.

==Organization and administration==

Its annual operating budget is approximately $1.02 billion. The most recent and ongoing fundraising campaign, dubbed &quot;Soaring Higher&quot;, was announced on September 28, 2023. The campaign aims to raise $3 billion, double the last campaign&#x27;s goal. Of this goal, $1.1 billion is earmarked for student financial aid, $750 million is for student life initiatives, and $1.15 billion is for academic programs.

===Catholic and Jesuit===

As of 2005, there were 112 Jesuits living on the Boston College campus, including members of the faculty and administration, graduate students, and visiting international scholars.

The chapel for the university is located in St. Mary&#x27;s Hall, the Jesuit residential facility. Additional BC chapels are Trinity Chapel on the Newton Campus, St. Joseph&#x27;s Chapel in the Basement of Gonzaga Hall on Upper Campus, Simboli Hall Chapel on the Brighton Campus, and St. Catherine of Sienna Chapel in Cushing Hall. Over 70 Catholic Masses are celebrated on Campus each week during the Academic Year. The college also maintains close relations with the nearby Church of Saint Ignatius of Loyola.

===Affiliated institutions===
St. Columbkille Parish is a Catholic Church and elementary school in Brighton, Massachusetts, that has an alliance with BC. Under the agreement, the parish school is to be governed by a board of members and a board of trustees comprising representatives from the Archdiocese of Boston, Boston College, St. Columbkille Parish and the greater Boston community.

=== McMullen Museum of Art ===
The McMullen Museum of Art, located on Boston College&#x27;s Brighton campus, was established in 1993 and named in 1996 to honor John J. McMullen&#x27;s parents. In 2016, it moved to a new facility with nearly double the exhibition space and enhanced features. The museum is recognized for its multidisciplinary exhibitions that contextualize art within broader political and cultural narratives, with notable collections including works by prominent artists such as Winslow Homer and Pablo Picasso. Significant exhibitions have included &quot;Carrie Mae Weems: Strategies of Engagement&quot; and &quot;Saints and Sinners: Caravaggio and the Baroque Image,&quot; which helped establish the museum&#x27;s reputation.

=== O&#x27;Neill Library ===
Before the Thomas P. O’Neill, Jr. Library opened in 1984, Bapst Library had served as BC’s main research facility since 1925. During Monan&#x27;s tenure, the university transformed from a small college into a national institution. Monan played a key role in planning O’Neill Library to meet the needs of this transformation. In a 1992 interview, Monan expressed pride in the library&#x27;s impact, noting how it was often filled with students studying and contributing to the overall learning experience for both students and faculty.

=== Bapst Library ===
Opened in 1928, Bapst Library was named for the first president of Boston College (Johannes Bapst, S.J., 1815 to 1887) and it was one of the few structures built according to Charles Donagh Maginnis&#x27; original &quot;Oxford in America&quot; master plan. Bapst served as the university&#x27;s main library until 1984.

==Student life==
===AHANA===
AHANA is the term Boston College uses to refer to persons of African-American, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American descent. The term was coined at Boston College in 1979 by two students, Alfred Feliciano and Valerie Lewis, who objected to the name &quot;Office of Minority Programs&quot; used by Boston College at the time. They cited the definition of the word minority as &quot;less than&quot; and proposed, instead, to use the term AHANA which they felt celebrated social cultural differences. After receiving overwhelming approval from the university&#x27;s board of trustees, and UGBC president Dan Cotter, the Office of Minority Student Programs became the Office of AHANA Student Programs. The term, or one or its derivative forms, such as ALANA (where &quot;Latino&quot; is substituted for &quot;Hispanic&quot;), has become common on a number of other American university campuses. Boston College, which has registered the term AHANA as a trademark, has granted official permission for its use to over 50 institutions and organizations in the United States. Many more use the term unofficially. Other institutions that use the AHANA acronym include Suffolk University, Cleveland State University, Eastern Mennonite University, Saint Martin&#x27;s University, Le Moyne College, and Salem State University. There have been cases of racist graffiti and vandalism on dorm walls.

==Eagles athletics program==
Boston College&#x27;s athletic teams, known as the Eagles, compete at the NCAA Division I level across various sports, including football in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS). They have been members of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) since the 2005–06 season after previously competing in the Big East Conference from 1979–80 to 2004–05. Notably, Boston College was the only Catholic institution that played football in the Big East.

The men’s teams participate in several ACC sports, such as baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, soccer, swimming, tennis, and track &amp; field. Additionally, the Eagles compete in non-ACC sports like fencing, ice hockey, sailing, and skiing.

The women’s teams have a similarly broad range of sports, including ACC competitions in basketball, cross country, field hockey, golf, lacrosse, rowing, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track &amp; field, and volleyball. Beyond the ACC, they also compete in fencing, ice hockey, sailing, and skiing.

=== Athletic facilities ===
The main venue for football is Alumni Stadium, which accommodates 44,500 spectators. It stands as the centerpiece of Boston College’s athletic facilities. Conte Forum, housing Kelley Rink, serves as the home for basketball and ice hockey, with seating capacities of 8,606 and 7,884, respectively.

The university also offers other key facilities, such as Eddie Pellagrini Diamond at John Shea Field, which is the home field for baseball with a capacity of 1,000, and the Newton Soccer Complex, which seats 1,000 fans. The Margot Connell Recreation Center provides additional support for athletic training and student recreation, while the Yawkey Athletics Center, opened in 2005, further enhances the university&#x27;s athletic infrastructure.

The official school colors, maroon and gold, are displayed at all athletic events.

Eagle mascot – Baldwin:

The Eagle serves as the iconic mascot for Boston College, with the character Baldwin the Eagle representing this symbol of pride and tradition at football, hockey, and basketball games. Baldwin, named as a play on the &quot;bald&quot; head of the American bald eagle and the word &quot;win,&quot; embodies the spirit of the Eagles.

==== Fight Song: &quot;For Boston&quot; ====

&quot;For Boston&quot; is claimed to be America&#x27;s oldest college fight song, composed by T. J. Hurley in 1885. It has two verses but the most commonly sung one is the first verse. Boston-based band Dropkick Murphys covered this song on their album &quot;Sing Loud, Sing Proud!&quot;. Changes have been made to the song, including reworking the phrase &quot;for here men are men&quot; into &quot;for here all are one&quot; in the first verse. 

==== Red bandanas ====
The Eagles annually wear red bandanna-themed uniforms in honor of fallen September 11, 2001 hero Welles Crowther, class of 1999. Crowther, who played on BC&#x27;s lacrosse team, was an equity trader who died saving the lives of at least 10 people during the 2001 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center in New York City. He used a red bandanna that he often carried to keep from breathing in smoke and debris.

In 1970, BC faced student unrest due to a proposed $500 tuition increase amid a financial crisis, prompting protests and a strike led by students and supported by Professor Harold Petersen. As tensions escalated, students voiced concerns over rising costs and a lack of administrative transparency, ultimately leading to a broader anti-war movement following the Kent State shootings. This period was marked by significant campus activism, with BC students pushing for changes that culminated in the severing of ties with ROTC in the fall of 1970.

=== Protests against racism ===
On October 18, 2017, hundreds of students walked out of class in a protest against racism and to demand the college officials pay more attention to the school&#x27;s racial climate. The walk out was sparked by the defacing of two Black Lives Matter posters and an offensive photo was circulated on social media sites. On December 8, 2018, walls, furniture, and a bathroom in the Welch Hall were vandalized with racist, anti-black graffiti. Also, over the previous months, pro-refugee and Black Lives Matter signs were repeatedly removed around campus.

=== LGBT ===
In 2003, after years of student-led discussions and efforts, and administrators&#x27; repeated rejection of pleas from students, the school approved a Gay-Straight Alliance, the first university-funded gay support group on campus. In 2004, between 1,000 and 1,200 students rallied behind a student-led campaign to expand the school&#x27;s non-discrimination statement to include equal protection for gays and lesbians. Earlier that year 84% of the student body voted in favor of a student referendum calling for a change in policy. After several months of discussion the university changed its statement of nondiscrimination to make it more welcoming to gay students in May 2005, but stopped short of prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.

==Notable persons==

BC students were universally called &quot;Heightsmen&quot; until 1925 when Caitlin Beckman became the first &quot;Heightswoman&quot; to receive a BC degree. &quot;Heightsonian&quot; was originally conceived as a way to gender neutralize the original term &quot;Heightsmen&quot;, though &quot;Eagles&quot;, once exclusively used for members of the university&#x27;s athletics teams, is more commonly used. The term &quot;Golden Eagles&quot; refers strictly to BC graduates who have celebrated their 50th anniversary reunion. &quot;Double Eagles&quot; refer to alumni received an undergraduate and graduate degree from the college and &quot;Triple Eagles&quot; are those alumni who are also attended Boston College High School.

There are over 179,000 alumni in over 120 countries around the world. Boston College students have been recipients of Rhodes, Marshall, Mellon, Fulbright, Truman, Churchill, and Goldwater scholarships. Boston College alumni include 3 Rhodes, 22 Truman, and 171 Fulbright scholars.

<text>Temazepam, sold under the brand name Restoril among others, is a medication of the benzodiazepine class which is generally used to treat severe or debilitating insomnia. It is taken by mouth. Temazepam is rapidly absorbed, and significant hypnotic and anxiolytic effects begin in less than 30 minutes and can last for up to eight hours. Prescriptions for hypnotics such as temazepam have seen a dramatic decrease since 2010, while anxiolytics such as alprazolam, clonazepam, and lorazepam have increased or remained stable. Temazepam and similar hypnotics, such as triazolam (Halcion) are generally reserved for severe and debilitating insomnia. They have largely been replaced by z-drugs (zopiclone, zolpidem) and atypical antidepressants (trazodone, mirtazapine) as first line treatment for insomnia.
Common side effects include drowsiness, motor and cognitive impairment, lethargy, confusion, euphoria, and dizziness. Serious side effects may include hallucinations, hypotension, respiratory depression, abuse, anaphylaxis, and suicide. Use is generally not recommended together with alcohol or opioids. If the dose is rapidly decreased withdrawal may occur. Use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is not recommended. Temazepam is a short-acting benzodiazepine and hypnotic. It works by affecting GABA within the brain.
Temazepam was patented in 1962 and came into medical use in 1969. It is available as a generic medication. In 2021, it was the 208th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2million prescriptions.
==Medical uses==

In sleep laboratory studies, temazepam significantly decreased the number of nightly awakenings, but has the drawback of distorting the normal sleep pattern. It is officially indicated for severe insomnia and other severe or disabling sleep disorders. The prescribing guidelines in the UK limit the prescribing of hypnotics to two to four weeks due to concerns of tolerance and dependence.

The American Academy of Sleep Medicine&#x27;s 2017 clinical practice guidelines recommended the use of temazepam in the treatment of sleep-onset and sleep-maintenance insomnia. It rated the recommendation as weak, the quality of evidence as moderate, and concluded that the potential benefits outweighed the potential harms. The guidelines found that temazepam at a dose of 15mg reduces sleep latency by 37minutes (95% 21 to 53minutes), increases total sleep time by 99minutes (95% 63 to 135minutes), and provides a small improvement to sleep quality. The improvements in sleep latency and total sleep time were numerically much greater than any of the other included sleep medications, including eszopiclone, zopiclone, zolpidem, triazolam, estazolam, quazepam, flurazepam, trazodone, diphenhydramine, gabapentin, among others.

The United States Air Force uses temazepam as one of the hypnotics approved as a &quot;no-go pill&quot; to help aviators and special-duty personnel sleep in support of mission readiness. &quot;Ground tests&quot; are necessary prior to required authorization being issued to use the medication in an operational situation, and a 12-hour restriction is imposed on subsequent flight operation. The other hypnotics used as &quot;no-go pills&quot; are zaleplon and zolpidem, which have shorter mandatory recovery periods.

==Contraindications==
Use of temazepam should be avoided, when possible, in individuals with these conditions:

* Ataxia (gross lack of coordination of muscle movements)
* Severe hypoventilation
* Acute narrow-angle glaucoma
* Severe hepatic deficiencies (hepatitis and liver cirrhosis decrease elimination by a factor of two)
* Severe renal deficiencies (e.g. patients on dialysis)
* Sleep apnea
* Severe depression, particularly when accompanied by suicidal tendencies
* Acute intoxication with alcohol, narcotics, or other psychoactive substances
* Myasthenia gravis (autoimmune disorder causing muscle weakness)
* Hypersensitivity or allergy to any drug in the benzodiazepine class

===Special caution needed===
Temazepam may cause harm to the fetus. The safety and effectiveness of temazepam has not been established in children. Benzodiazepines also require special caution if used in the elderly, alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals, and individuals with comorbid psychiatric disorders.

Temazepam, similar to other benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic drugs, causes impairments in body balance and standing steadiness in individuals who wake up at night or the next morning. Falls and hip fractures are frequently reported. The combination with alcohol increases these impairments. Partial but incomplete tolerance develops to these impairments. The smallest possible effective dose should be used in elderly or very ill patients, as a risk of apnea and/or cardiac arrest exists. This risk is increased when temazepam is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress the central nervous system (CNS).

===Misuse and dependence===
Because benzodiazepines can be abused and lead to dependence, their use should be avoided in people in certain particularly high-risk groups. These groups include people with a history of alcohol or drug dependence, people significantly struggling with their mood or people with longstanding mental health difficulties. If temazepam must be prescribed to people in these groups, they should generally be monitored very closely for signs of misuse and development of dependence.

==Adverse effects==
In September 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the boxed warning be updated for all benzodiazepine medicines to describe the risks of abuse, misuse, addiction, physical dependence, and withdrawal reactions consistently across all the medicines in the class.

===Common===
Side effects are typical of hypnotic benzodiazepines, though temazepam has more pronounced CNS depressant effects, and include somnolence, sedation, dizziness, fatigue, ataxia, headache, lethargy, impairment of memory and learning, longer reaction time and impairment of motor functions (including coordination problems), slurred speech, decreased physical performance, numbed emotions, reduced alertness, muscle weakness, blurred vision (especially in higher doses or in those with low tolerance), and inattention. Euphoria was a reported side effect with its use, which is uncommon or not ever reported amongst benzodiazepines. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, temazepam had an incidence of euphoria of 1.5%, which is considered rare. Feelings of euphoria, pleasant sedation, and inner feelings of peace are reported by those who abuse drugs, particularly in those who use temazepam intravenously. It has the highest ratings reported among benzodiazepines by recreational drug users. Drug users tend have a higher preference for temazepam over other benzodiazepines. The three most common reasons for temazepam preference were due to speed of onset, that a it was &#x27;strong&#x27; and that it gave a good &#x27;high&#x27;. Anterograde amnesia is also common, and respiratory depression in higher doses has proven to be fatal, even when temazepam is taken alone. In medical literature from Australia, Ireland, the UK, Canada, and the United States, temazepam is the only benzodiazepine which has been fatal in overdoses without combination with other CNS depresssants. This unique feature is due to the toxicity of the drug, which numerous studies have ranked it as being most toxic.

A 2009 meta-analysis found a 44% higher rate of mild infections, such as pharyngitis or sinusitis, in people taking Temazepam or other hypnotic drugs compared to those taking a placebo.

===Less common===
Hyperhydrosis, hypotension, burning eyes, increased appetite, changes in libido, hallucinations, faintness, nystagmus, vomiting, pruritus, gastrointestinal disturbances, nightmares, palpitation and paradoxical reactions including restlessness, aggression, violence, overstimulation and agitation have been reported, but are rare (less than 0.5%).

Before taking temazepam, one should ensure that at least 8 hours are available to dedicate to sleep. Failing to do so can increase the side effects of the drug.

Like all benzodiazepines, the use of this drug in combination with alcohol potentiates the side effects, and can lead to toxicity and death.

Though rare, residual &quot;hangover&quot; effects after night-time administration of temazepam occasionally occur. These include sleepiness, impaired psychomotor and cognitive functions which may persist into the next day, impaired driving ability, and possible increased risks of falls and hip fractures, especially in the elderly.

===Tolerance===
Chronic or excessive use of temazepam may cause drug tolerance, which can develop rapidly, so this drug is not recommended for long-term use. In 1979, the Institute of Medicine (USA) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse stated that most hypnotics lose their sleep-inducing properties after about three to 14 days. In use longer than one to two weeks, tolerance will rapidly develop towards the ability of temazepam to maintain sleep, resulting in a loss of effectiveness. Some studies have observed tolerance to temazepam after as little as one week&#x27;s use. Another study examined the short-term effects of the accumulation of temazepam over seven days in elderly inpatients, and found little tolerance developed during the accumulation of the drug. Other studies examined the use of temazepam over six days and saw no evidence of tolerance. A study in 11 young male subjects showed significant tolerance occurs to temazepam&#x27;s thermoregulatory effects and sleep inducing properties after one week of use of 30-mg temazepam. Body temperature is well correlated with the sleep-inducing or insomnia-promoting properties of drugs.

In one study, the drug sensitivity of people who had used temazepam for one to 20 years was no different from that of controls. An additional study, in which at least one of the authors is employed by multiple drug companies, examined the efficacy of temazepam treatment on chronic insomnia over three months, and saw no drug tolerance, with the authors even suggesting the drug might become more effective over time.

Establishing continued efficacy beyond a few weeks can be complicated by the difficulty in distinguishing between the return of the original insomnia complaint and withdrawal or rebound related insomnia. Sleep EEG studies on hypnotic benzodiazepines show tolerance tends to occur completely after one to four weeks with sleep EEG returning to pretreatment levels. The paper concluded that due to concerns about long-term use involving toxicity, tolerance and dependence, as well as to controversy over long-term efficacy, wise prescribers should restrict benzodiazepines to a few weeks and avoid continuing prescriptions for months or years. A review of the literature found the nonpharmacological treatment options were a more effective treatment option for insomnia due to their sustained improvements in sleep quality.

===Physical dependence===
Temazepam, like other benzodiazepine drugs, can cause physical dependence and addiction. Withdrawal from temazepam or other benzodiazepines after regular use often leads to benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, which resembles symptoms during alcohol and barbiturate withdrawal. The higher the dose and the longer the drug is taken, the greater the risk of experiencing unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms can also occur from standard dosages and after short-term use. Abrupt withdrawal from therapeutic doses of temazepam after long-term use may result in a severe benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Gradual and careful reduction of the dosage, preferably with a long-acting benzodiazepine with long half-life active metabolites, such as chlordiazepoxide or diazepam, are recommended to prevent severe withdrawal syndromes from developing. Other hypnotic benzodiazepines are not recommended. A study in rats found temazepam is cross tolerant with barbiturates and is able to effectively substitute for barbiturates and suppress barbiturate withdrawal signs.
Rare cases are reported in the medical literature of psychotic states developing after abrupt withdrawal from benzodiazepines, even from therapeutic doses. Antipsychotics increase the severity of benzodiazepine withdrawal effects with an increase in the intensity and severity of convulsions.
Patients who were treated in the hospital with temazepam or nitrazepam have continued taking these after leaving the hospital. Hypnotic uses in the hospital were recommended to be limited to five nights&#x27; use only, to avoid the development of withdrawal symptoms such as insomnia.

== Interactions ==

As with other benzodiazepines, temazepam produces additive CNS-depressant effects when coadministered with other medications which themselves produce CNS depression, such as barbiturates, alcohol, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, nonselective MAO inhibitors, phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, skeletal muscle relaxants, antihistamines, and anaesthetics. Administration of theophylline or aminophylline has been shown to reduce the sedative effects of temazepam and other benzodiazepines.

Unlike many benzodiazepines, pharmacokinetic interactions involving the P450 system have not been observed with temazepam. Temazepam shows no significant interaction with CYP3A4 inhibitors (&quot;e.g.&quot; itraconazole, erythromycin). Oral contraceptives may decrease the effectiveness of temazepam and speed up its elimination half-life.

==Overdose==
Overdosage of temazepam results in increasing CNS effects, including:

* Somnolence (difficulty staying awake)
* Mental confusion
* Respiratory depression
* Hypotension
* Cyanosis
* Impaired motor functions
* Impaired or absent reflexes
* Impaired coordination
* Impaired balance
* Dizziness, sedation
* Coma
* Death

Temazepam had the highest rate of drug intoxication, including overdose, among common benzodiazepines in cases with and without combination with alcohol in a 1985 study. Temazepam and nitrazepam were the two benzodiazepines most commonly detected in overdose-related deaths in an Australian study of drug deaths. Of the two, temazepam had higher number of deaths, and only temazepam was fatal as the lone drug in three cases, while all cases of nitrazepam deaths were due to mixes with other CNS depressants. Alcohol, heroin, and prescription opioids, with morphine being the opioid with the highest mortality rate. A 1993 British study found temazepam to have the highest number of deaths per million prescriptions among medications commonly prescribed in the 1980s (11.9, versus 5.9 for benzodiazepines overall, taken with or without alcohol).

A 1995 Australian study of patients admitted to hospital after benzodiazepine overdose corroborated these results, and found temazepam overdose much more likely to lead to coma than other benzodiazepines (odds ratio 1.86). The authors noted several factors, such as differences in potency, receptor affinity, and rate of absorption between benzodiazepines, could explain this higher toxicity. Although benzodiazepines have a high therapeutic index, temazepam is one of the more dangerous of this class of drugs. The combination of alcohol and temazepam makes death by alcohol poisoning more likely.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
The main pharmacological action of temazepam is to increase the effect of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at the GABAA receptor. This causes sedation, motor impairment, ataxia, anxiolysis, anticonvulsant effects, muscle relaxation, and a reinforcing effect.

As a medication before surgery, temazepam decreased cortisol in elderly patients. In rats, it triggered the release of vasopressin into paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and decreased the release of ACTH under stress.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Oral administration of 15 to 45 mg of temazepam in humans resulted in rapid absorption with significant blood levels achieved in fewer than 30 minutes and peak levels at two to three hours.

In a single- and multiple-dose absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) study, using tritium-labelled drug, temazepam was well absorbed and found to have minimal (8%) first-pass drug metabolism. No active metabolites were formed and the only significant metabolite present in blood was the O-conjugate. The unchanged drug was 96% bound to plasma proteins. The blood-level decline of the parent drug was biphasic, with the short half-life ranging from 0.4 to 0.6 hours and the terminal half-life from 3.5 to 18.4 hours (mean 8.8 hours), depending on the study population and method of determination.

Temazepam has very good bioavailability, with almost 100% being absorbed following being taken by mouth. The drug is metabolized through conjugation and demethylation prior to excretion. Most of the drug is excreted in the urine, with about 20% appearing in the faeces. The major metabolite was the O-conjugate of temazepam (90%); the O-conjugate of N-desmethyl temazepam was a minor metabolite (7%).

==Chemistry==
Temazepam is a benzodiazepine. It is a white, crystalline substance, very slightly soluble in water, and sparingly soluble in alcohol.

===Synthesis===
Pharmacologically active metabolite of diazepam, q.v.

N-oxides are prone to undergo the Polonovski rearrangement when treated with acetic anhydride, and this was illustrated by the synthesis of oxazepam. It is not surprising that the N-methyl analogue (1) also undergoes this process, and hydrolysis of the resulting acetate gives temazepam (2). Care must be exacted with the conditions, or the inactive rearrangement product (3) results.

==History==
Temazepam was synthesized in 1964, but it came into use in 1981 when its ability to counter insomnia was realized. By the late 1980s, temazepam was one of the most popular and widely prescribed hypnotics on the market and it became one of the most widely prescribed drugs.

==Society and culture==

===Recreational use===
Temazepam is a drug with a high potential for misuse.

Benzodiazepines have been abused orally and intravenously. Different benzodiazepines have different abuse potential; the more rapid the increase in the plasma level following ingestion, the greater the intoxicating effect and the more open to abuse the drug becomes. The speed of onset of action of a particular benzodiazepine correlates well with the &#x27;popularity&#x27; of that drug for abuse. The two most common reasons for preference were that a benzodiazepine was &#x27;strong&#x27; and that it gave a good &#x27;high&#x27;.

A 1995 study found that temazepam is more rapidly absorbed and oxazepam is more slowly absorbed than most other benzodiazepines.

A 1985 study found that temazepam and triazolam maintained significantly higher rates of self-injection than a variety of other benzodiazepines. The study tested and compared the abuse liability of temazepam, triazolam, diazepam, lorazepam, oxazepam, flurazepam, alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, clonazepam, nitrazepam, flunitrazepam, bromazepam, and clorazepate. The study tested self-injection rates on human, baboon, and rat subjects. All test subjects consistently showed a strong preference for temazepam and triazolam over all the rest of the benzodiazepines included in the study.

====North America====
In North America, temazepam misuse is not widespread. Other benzodiazepines are more commonly prescribed for insomnia. In the United States, temazepam is the fifth-most prescribed benzodiazepine, however there is a major drop off from the top four most prescribed (alprazolam, lorazepam, diazepam, and clonazepam in that order). Individuals abusing benzodiazepines obtain the drug by getting prescriptions from several doctors, forging prescriptions, or buying diverted pharmaceutical products on the illicit market. North America has never had a serious problem with temazepam misuse, but is becoming increasingly vulnerable to the illicit trade of temazepam.

===Australia===
Temazepam is a Schedule 4 drug and requires a prescription. The drug accounts for most benzodiazepine sought by forgery of prescriptions and through pharmacy burglary in Victoria. Due to rife intravenous abuse, the Australian government decided to put it under a more restrictive schedule than it had been, and since March 2004 temazepam capsules have been withdrawn from the Australian market, leaving only 10 mg tablets available.

Benzodiazepines are commonly detected by customs at different ports and airports, arriving by mail, also found occasionally in the baggage of air passengers, mostly small or medium quantities (up to 200–300 tablets) for personal use. From 2003 to 2006, customs detected about 500 illegal importations of benzodiazepines per year, most frequently diazepam. Quantities varied from single tablets to 2,000 tablets.

====United Kingdom====
In 1987, temazepam was the most widely abused legal prescription drug in the United Kingdom. The use of benzodiazepines by street-drug abusers was part of a polydrug abuse pattern, but many of those entering treatment facilities were declaring temazepam as their main drug of abuse. Temazepam was the most commonly used benzodiazepine in a study, published 1994, of injecting drug users in seven cities, and had been injected from preparations of capsules, tablets, and syrup. The increase in use of heroin, often mixed with other drugs, which most often included temazepam, diazepam, and alcohol, was a major factor in the increase in drug-related deaths in Glasgow and Edinburgh in 1990–1992. Temazepam use was particularly associated with violent or disorderly behaviours and contact with the police in a 1997 study of young single homeless people in Scotland. The BBC series &quot;Panorama&quot; featured an episode titled &quot;Temazepam Wars&quot;, dealing with the epidemic of temazepam abuse and directly related crime in Paisley, Scotland. The trend was mocked in the 1995 Black Grape song &quot;Temazi Party&quot; (also called &quot;Tramazi Party&quot;).

===Medical research issues===
The &quot;Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine&quot; published a paper expressing concerns about benzodiazepine receptor agonist drugs, the benzodiazepines and the Z-drugs used as hypnotics in humans. The paper cites a systematic review of the medical literature concerning insomnia medications and states almost all trials of sleep disorders and drugs are sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry, while this is not the case in general medicine or psychiatry. It cites another study that &quot;found that the odds ratio for finding results favorable to industry in industry-sponsored trials was 3.6 times as high as in non–industry-sponsored studies&quot;. Issues discussed regarding industry-sponsored studies include: comparison of a drug to a placebo, but not to an alternative treatment; unpublished studies with unfavorable outcomes; and trials organized around a placebo baseline followed by drug treatment, but not counterbalanced with parallel-placebo-controlled studies. Quoting a 1979 report that too little research into hypnotics was independent of the drug manufacturers, the authors conclude, &quot;the public desperately needs an equipoised assessment of hypnotic benefits and risks&quot; and the NIH and VA should provide leadership to that end.

===Street terms===
Street terms for temazepam include king kong pills (formerly referred to barbiturates, now more commonly refers to temazepam), jellies, jelly, Edinburgh , tams, terms, , , , , beans, eggs, green eggs, wobbly eggs, knockouts, hardball, , oranges (common term in Australia and New Zealand), rugby balls, , terminators, red and blue, no-gos, , blackout, green devils, drunk pills, brainwash, mind erasers, , (combined with buprenorphine), mommy&#x27;s big helper, vitamin T, big T, TZ, the , (North America) and others.

===Legal status===
In Austria, temazepam is listed in UN71 Schedule III under the Psychotropic Substances Decree of 1997. The drug is considered to have a high potential for abuse and addiction, but has accepted medical use for the treatment of severe insomnia.

In Australia, temazepam is a Schedule 4 - Prescription Only medicine. It is primarily used for the treatment of insomnia, and is also seen as pre-anaesthetic medication.

In Canada, temazepam is a Schedule IV controlled substance requiring a registered doctor&#x27;s prescription.

In Denmark, temazepam is listed as a Class D substance under the Executive Order 698 of 1993 on Euphoric Substances which means it has a high potential for abuse, but is used for medical and scientific purposes.

In Finland, temazepam is more tightly controlled than other benzodiazepines. The temazepam product Normison was pulled out of shelves and banned because the liquid inside gelatin capsules had caused a large increase in intravenous temazepam use. The other temazepam product, Tenox, was not affected and remains as prescription medicine. Temazepam intravenous use has not decreased to the level before Normison came to the market.

In France, temazepam is listed as a psychotropic substance as are other similar drugs. It is prescribed with a nonrenewable prescription (a new doctor visit every time), available only in 7 or 14-pill packaging for one or two weeks. One brand was withdrawn from the market in 2013 due to rampant abuse.

In Hong Kong, temazepam is regulated under Schedule 1 of Hong Kong&#x27;s Chapter 134 Dangerous Drugs Ordinance. Temazepam can only be used legally by health professionals and for university research purposes. The substance can be given by pharmacists under a prescription. Anyone who supplies the substance without prescription can be fined HKD$10,000. The penalty for trafficking or manufacturing the substance is a $5,000,000-fine and life imprisonment. Possession of the substance for consumption without license from the Department of Health is illegal with a $1,000,000-fine and/or seven years of jail time.

In Ireland, temazepam is a Schedule 3 controlled substance with strict restrictions.

In the Netherlands, temazepam is available for prescription as 10- or 20-mg tablets and capsules. Formulations of temazepam containing less than 20 mg are included in List 2 of the Opium Law, while formulations containing 20 mg or more of the drug (along with the gel-capsules) are a List 1 substance of the Opium Law, thus subject to more stringent regulation. Besides being used for insomnia, it is also occasionally used as a preanesthetic medication.

In Norway, temazepam is not available as a prescription drug. It is regulated as a Class A substance under Norway&#x27;s Narcotics Act.

In Portugal, temazepam is a Schedule IV controlled drug under Decree-Law 15/93.

In Sweden, temazepam is classed as a &quot;narcotic&quot; drug listed as both a List II (Schedule II) which denotes it is a drug with limited medicinal use and a high risk of addiction, and is also listed as a List V (Schedule V) substance which denotes the drug is prohibited in Sweden under the Narcotics Drugs Act (1968). Temazepam is banned in Sweden and possession and distribution of even small amounts is punishable by a prison sentence and a fine. Temazepam found in Sweden is usually trafficked from Finland

In Switzerland, temazepam is a Class B controlled substance, like all other benzodiazepines. This means it is a prescription-only drug.

In the United Kingdom, temazepam is a Class C controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (Schedule 3 under the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001). If prescribed privately (not on the NHS), temazepam is available only by a special controlled drug prescription form (FP10PCD) and pharmacies are obligated to follow special procedures for storage and dispensing.

In the United States, Temazepam is a Schedule IV drug under the international Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971 and is only available by prescription.

<text>Caesar Tervel (), also called Tarvel, Terval, or Terbelis in Byzantine sources, was the ruler Caesar of Bulgaria during the First Bulgarian Empire at the beginning of the 8th century. In 705 Emperor Justinian II named him caesar, the first foreigner to receive this title. He was raised a pagan like his grandfather Khan Kubrat, but was later possibly baptised by the Byzantine clergy. Tervel played an important role in defeating the Arabs during the siege of Constantinople in 717–718. The Nominalia of the Bulgarian khans states that Tervel belonged to the Dulo clan and reigned for 21 years. The testimony of the source and some later traditions allow identifying Tervel as the son of Asparukh.

==Alliance with Justinian II==

Tervel is first mentioned in the Byzantine sources in 704, when he was approached by the deposed and exiled Byzantine emperor Justinian II. Justinian acquired Tervel&#x27;s support for an attempted restoration to the Byzantine throne in exchange for friendship, gifts, and his daughter in marriage. With an army of 15,000 horsemen provided by Tervel, Justinian suddenly advanced on Constantinople and managed to gain entrance into the city in 705. The restored emperor executed his supplanters, the emperors Leontius and Tiberius III, alongside many of their supporters. Justinian awarded Tervel with many gifts, the title of &quot;kaisar&quot; (caesar), which made him second only to the emperor and the first foreign ruler in Byzantine history to receive such a title, and a territorial concession in northeastern Thrace, a region called Zagora. Whether Justinian&#x27;s daughter Anastasia was married to Tervel as had been arranged is unknown.

Only three years later, however, when Justinian II consolidated his throne he violated this arrangement and commenced military operations to recover the ceded area but Khan Tervel routed the Byzantines at the Battle of Anchialus (near present-day Pomorie) in 708. In 711, faced by a serious revolt in Asia Minor, Justinian again sought the aid of Tervel, but obtained only lukewarm support manifested in an army of 3,000. Outmaneuvered by the rebel emperor Philippicus, Justinian was captured and executed, while his Bulgarian allies were allowed to retire to their country. Tervel took advantage of the disorders in Byzantium and raided Thrace in 712, plundering as far as the vicinity of Constantinople.

Given the chronological information of the &quot;Imennik&quot;, Tervel would have died in 715. However, the Byzantine Chronicler Theophanes the Confessor ascribes Tervel a role in an attempt to restore the deposed Emperor Anastasius II in 718 or 719. If Tervel had survived this long, he would have been the Bulgarian ruler who concluded a new treaty (confirming the annual tribute paid by the Byzantines to Bulgaria, the territorial concessions in Thrace, regulating commercial relations and the treating of political refugees) with Emperor Theodosius III in 716. However, elsewhere Theophanes records the name of the Bulgarian ruler who concluded the treaty of 716 as &quot;Kormesios&quot;, i.e., Tervel&#x27;s eventual successor Kormesiy. It is probable that the chronicler ascribed the events of 718 or 719 to Tervel simply because this was the last name of a Bulgar ruler that he was familiar with, and that his sources had been silent about the name, as in his account of the siege of Constantinople. According to another theory Kermesios was authorized by Tervel to sign the treaty.

Most researches agree that it was during the time of Tervel when the famous rock relief the Madara Rider was created as a memorial to the victories over the Byzantines, to honour his father Asparukh and as an expression of the glory of the Bulgarian state.

==The war with the Arabs in 717–718 and later life==

On 25 May 717, Leo III the Isaurian was crowned Emperor of Byzantium. During the summer of the same year the Arabs, led by Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik, crossed the Dardanelles and besieged Constantinople with a large army and navy.

Leo III made a plea to Tervel for help, relying on the treaty of 716, and Tervel agreed. The first clash between the Bulgars and the Arabs ended with a Bulgar victory. During the very first stages of the siege the Bulgars appeared in the Muslim rear and large part of their army was destroyed and the rest were trapped. The Arabs built two trenches around their camp facing the Bulgarian army and the walls of the city. They persisted with the siege despite the severe winter with 100 days of snowfall. In the spring, the Byzantine navy destroyed the Arab fleets that had arrived with new provisions and equipment, while a Byzantine army defeated Arab reinforcements in Bithynia. Finally, in early summer the Arabs engaged the Bulgars in battle but suffered a crushing defeat. According to Theophanes the Confessor, the Bulgars slaughtered some 22,000 Arabs in the battle. Shortly after, the Arabs raised the siege.

In 719, Tervel again interfered in the internal affairs of the Byzantine Empire when the deposed emperor Anastasios II asked for his assistance to regain the throne. Tervel provided him with troops and 360,000 gold coins. Anastasios marched to Constantinople, but its population refused to cooperate. In the meantime Leo III sent a letter to Tervel in which he urged him to respect the treaty and to prefer peace to war. Because Anastasios was abandoned by his supporters, the Bulgarian ruler agreed to Leo III&#x27;s pleas and broke relations with the usurper. He also sent Leo III many of the conspirators who had sought refuge in Pliska.

== The cult of St. Trivelius ==
In his &quot;Slav-Bulgarian History&quot; (1762), Paisius of Hilendar interprets Tervel&#x27;s character based on a copperplate engraving from Hristofor Žefarović&#x27;s &quot;Stemmatografia&quot; (1741), which depicts St. David, king of Bulgaria and St. Theoctistus. In the image of Saint Theoctistus, which is the monastic name of the Serbian king Stefan Dragutin, Paisius recognized King Trivelius or Tervel. Among other things, Paisius wrote about this Bulgarian ruler:

&quot;&quot;Zographic History&quot; (1760&#x27;s) will even try to locate the monastery of St. Teoctist close to Ohrid, and the hieromonk Spiridon Gabrovski in his &quot;Istoriya&quot;&quot; from 1792, points out that in Ohrid &quot;in his monastery until today lie his relics&quot;. It is striking that the &quot;&quot;Zographic History&quot; and &quot;Slav-Bulgarian History&quot;, which appeared almost simultaneously, are the first texts that mention King Trivelius, in general, in Balkan literature, which is not the case in Western literature, where he has been strongly present since the 16th century. In the western literature, which was apparently also a source for the mentioned Athonian monks, there is also the episode about his monasticism, but in no source before the &quot;History of Paisius&quot; his monastic name is mentioned, which is obviously an original construction of Paisius in order to connect Trivelius with the figure of Theoctistus from the &quot;Stematographia&quot;&quot;. In addition, it is important to emphasize that Paisius was aware of the fact that the Serbian king Dragutin received monasticism with the name Theoctistus, so it is even more surprising that he connected the figure of the monk Theoctistus from the &quot;&quot;Stematographia&quot; with the Bulgarian ruler Trivelius.

Another copperplate engraving by Žefarović from the same year 1741, which was made just a few months before the publication of the &quot;Stemmatografia&quot;&quot;, is particularly useful for identifying the image of St. Theoctistus from the Stematography. This copperplate depicting Saint Sava with Serbian saints from the house of Nemanjic was conceived as a kind of propaganda political memorandum, and was sent as a congratulatory message to Empress Maria Theresa on the occasion of her ascension to the throne. Seventeen holy figures are represented on the copperplate. In the second row of saints, Saint Theoctistus is represented, with clearly written signatures. All the characters presented, without exception, find their analogy in the saints from the house of Nemanja, so such an analogy should be sought for the character of Saint Theoctist.

The interpretations by Paisius, by analogy and without critical analysis, will be taken up in the later Bulgarian literature and will create a fictitious and until then non-existent saint cult, which will be reflected in the paintings of the 18th and 19th centuries.

<doc id="239830" wikidata="Q175077" url="?curid=239830" title="Twenty-Four Histories">
<text>The Twenty-Four Histories, also known as the Orthodox Histories (), are a collection of official histories detailing the dynasties of China, from the legendary Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors in the 4th millennium BC to the Ming dynasty in the 17th century.

The Han dynasty official Sima Qian established many of the conventions of the genre, but the form was not fixed until much later. Starting with the Tang dynasty, each dynasty established an official office to write the history of its predecessor using official court records, partly in order to establish its own link to the earliest times. As fixed and edited in the Qing dynasty, the whole set contains 3,213 volumes and about 40 million words. It is considered one of the most important sources on Chinese history and culture.

The title &quot;Twenty-Four Histories&quot; dates from 1775, which was the 40th year in the reign of the Qianlong Emperor. This was when the last volume, the &quot;History of Ming&quot;, was reworked and a complete set of the histories was produced.

== History ==
The idea of compiling a collection of Chinese official histories have existed as the Three Kingdoms era, when the Three Histories consisted of &quot;Shiji&quot;, &quot;Book of Han&quot;, and &quot;Dongguan Hanji&quot;. &quot;Book of the Later Han&quot; would later gradually replace the &quot;Dongguan Hanji&quot;. After the &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; appeared, it was soon tacked on to produce the Early Four Historiographies .

By the Tang dynasty, the ten official histories starting from &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; and ending with &quot;Book of Sui&quot; were collectively called the Ten Histories. Combined with the earlier three, they make the Thirteen Histories. Two Tang scholars have written works based on the &quot;Thirteen Histories&quot;: &quot;Criticism of the Thirteen Histories&quot; by (20 volumes) and &quot;Index of the Thirteen Histories&quot; by Song Jian (10 volumes).

During the Song dynasty, on top of on the &quot;Thirteen Histories&quot;, &quot;History of the Southern Dynasties&quot;, &quot;History of the Northern Dynasties&quot;, &quot;New Book of Tang&quot;, and &quot;New History of the Five Dynasties&quot; were added to form the Seventeen Histories. Northern Song&#x27;s wrote &quot;Master Wang&#x27;s Enlightenment on the Seventeen Histories&quot;, and Southern Song&#x27;s wrote &quot;Detailed Excerpts of the Seventeen Histories&quot;.

The Twenty-One Histories was formed during the Ming dynasty. Qing dynasty&#x27;s Gu Yanwu wrote in &quot;Daily Knowledge Records: Official Edition of Twenty-One Histories&quot; : &quot;In Song times there were only seventeen histories, now with the addition of the histories of Song, Liao, Jin, and Yuan, there are twenty-one histories.&quot;

During the Yongzheng period of the Qing dynasty, after the completion of the &quot;History of Ming&quot;, they were collectively known as the Twenty-Two Histories, and Zhao Yi&#x27;s &quot;Notes on the Twenty-Two Histories&quot; was named accordingly. Later, with the addition of the &quot;Old Book of Tang&quot;, it became the Twenty-Three Histories. When compiling the Complete Library in Four Sections, the &quot;Old History of the Five Dynasties&quot;, which was extracted from the Yongle Encyclopedia, was also included, making it the Twenty-Four Histories.

=== Related works ===
There were attempts at producing new traditional histories after the fall of the Qing dynasty, but they either never gained widespread acceptance as part of the official historical canon or they remain unfinished.
=== Modern attempts at creating the official Qing history ===

In 1961, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the declaration of the Republic of China (ROC), the ROC government in Taiwan published the &quot;History of Qing&quot;, adding 21 supplementary chapters to the &quot;Draft History of Qing&quot; and revising many existing chapters to denounce the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) as an illegitimate, impostor regime. It also removed passages that were derogatory towards the Xinhai Revolution. This edition has not been widely accepted as the official Qing history because it is recognized that it was a rushed job motivated by political objectives. It does not correct most of the errors known to exist in the &quot;Draft History of Qing&quot;.

An additional project, attempting to write a &quot;New History of Qing&quot; incorporating new materials and improvements in historiography, lasted from 1988 to 2000. Only 33 chapters out of the projected 500 were published. This project was later abandoned following the rise of the Taiwanese nationalist Pan-Green Coalition, which argues that it is not the duty of Taiwan to compile the history of mainland China.

In 1961, the PRC also attempted to complete the Qing history, but historians were prevented from doing so against the backdrop of the Cultural Revolution.

In 2002, the PRC once again announced that it would complete the &quot;History of Qing&quot;. The project was approved in 2002, and put under the leadership of historian Dai Yi. Initially planned to be completed in 10 years, the project suffered multiple delays, pushing completion of the first draft to 2016. &quot;Chinese Social Sciences Today&quot; reported in April 2020 that the project&#x27;s results were being reviewed. However, in 2023, the manuscript was reportedly rejected, and there are also rumors that the project has been indefinitely halted.

== Modern editions ==
In China, the Zhonghua Book Company have edited a number of these histories. They have been collated, edited, and punctuated by Chinese specialists. From 1991 to 2003, it was translated from Literary Chinese into modern written vernacular Chinese, by Xu Jialu and other scholars.

== Translations ==
One of the &quot;Twenty-Four Histories&quot; is in the process of being fully translated into English: &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; by William Nienhauser, in nine volumes.

In Korean and Vietnamese, only the &quot;Records&quot; has been translated. Most of the histories have been translated into Japanese.

<text>An ogre (feminine: ogress) is a legendary monster depicted as a large, hideous, man-like being that eats ordinary human beings, especially infants and children. Ogres frequently feature in mythology, folklore, and fiction throughout the world. They appear in many classic works of literature, and are most often associated in fairy tales and legend.

In mythology, ogres are often depicted as inhumanly large, tall, and having a disproportionately large head, abundant hair, unusually colored skin, a voracious appetite, and a strong body. Ogres are closely linked with giants and with human cannibals in mythology. In both folklore and fiction, giants are often given ogrish traits (such as the giants in &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; and &quot;Jack the Giant Killer&quot;, the Giant Despair in &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;, and the Jötunn of Norse mythology); while ogres may be given giant-like traits.

Famous examples of ogres in folklore include the ogre in &quot;Puss in Boots&quot; and the ogre in &quot;Hop-o&#x27;-My-Thumb&quot;. Other characters sometimes described as ogres include the title character from &quot;Bluebeard&quot;, the Beast from &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, Humbaba from the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;, Grendel from &quot;Beowulf&quot;, Polyphemus the Cyclops from Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, the man-eating giant in &quot;Sinbad the Sailor&quot;, the oni of Japanese folklore and the ghouls of pre-Islamic Arabian religion.

== Etymology ==

The word &quot;ogre&quot; is of French origin, originally derived from the Etruscan god Orcus. Its earliest attestation is in Chrétien de Troyes&#x27; late 12th-century verse romance &quot;Perceval, li contes del graal&quot;, which contains the lines:
The &quot;ogres&quot; in this rhyme may refer to the ogres who were, in the pseudohistorical work &quot;History of the Kings of Britain&quot; by Geoffrey of Monmouth, the inhabitants of Britain prior to human settlement.

The word &quot;orco&quot; was widely used in Italy at least since 13th century, as attested by Jacomo Tolomei who, in the sonnet &quot;&quot; (&quot;The many fables, my friend, people tell&quot; – before 1290), compares popular characters of fairy tales, like ogres (whose specific characteristic was to eat people), giants, witches and talking animals, to real people he could see in his city of Siena. The Italian author Giambattista Basile (1575–1632) used the related Neapolitan word &quot;uerco&quot;, or in standard Italian, &quot;orco&quot; in some of his tales, and first talks of female orcs (IE in Petrosinella). This word is also documented in earlier Italian works (Fazio degli Uberti, 14th century; Luigi Pulci, 15th century; Ludovico Ariosto, 15th–16th centuries). An even older related word is Old English &quot;orcnēas&quot; found in Beowulf lines 112–113, which inspired J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;orc&quot;.

The word &quot;ogre&quot; came into wider usage in the works of Charles Perrault (1628–1703) or Marie-Catherine Jumelle de Berneville, Comtesse d&#x27; Aulnoy (1650–1705), both of whom were French authors. The first appearance of the word &quot;ogre&quot; in Perrault&#x27;s work occurred in his &quot;Histoires ou Contes du temps Passé&quot; (1696). It later appeared in several of his other fairy tales, many of which were based on the Neapolitan tales of Basile. The first example of a female ogre being referred to as an &quot;ogress&quot; is found in his version of &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, where it is spelled &quot;ogresse.&quot; Madame d&#x27;Aulnoy first employed the word &quot;ogre&quot; in her story &quot;L&#x27;Orangier et l&#x27;Abeille&quot; (1698), and was the first to use the word &quot;ogree&quot; to refer to the creature&#x27;s offspring.

== In modern fiction ==
In modern times, ogres have appeared in the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; role-playing game as large, powerful humanoid creatures, with slightly below average intelligence, throughout its editions as adversaries but also playable characters. The ogre was counted among the ten best low-level monsters by the authors of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons for Dummies&quot;. They posit that the ogre &quot;teaches players about fighting big, powerful, stupid monsters, which is an iconic D&amp;D experience&quot;.

The green-skinned ogre Shrek is a fictional character created by the American author William Steig that since 1990 has appeared in a book, several movies by DreamWorks Animation, a TV series, and a musical.

The Ogre Mulgarath is the main antagonist in &quot;The Spiderwick Chronicles&quot; books series (also adapted into a film and a TV series).

Ogres make up the army of Duke Igthorn, antagonists in &quot;Adventures of the Gummi Bears&quot;.
In this children&#x27;s TV series, they are presented as anthropomorphized creatures, emphasized through neomedieval trappings in clothing and equipment.

In Smurfs, ogres appear human-like but are stouter than humans.

In Disenchantment, Elfo&#x27;s maternal family are ogres which makes him a hybrid between an ogre and an elf.

<doc id="239836" wikidata="Q210390" url="?curid=239836" title="Aromaticity">
<text>In organic chemistry, aromaticity is a chemical property describing the way in which a conjugated ring of unsaturated bonds, lone pairs, or empty orbitals exhibits a stabilization stronger than would be expected from conjugation alone. The earliest use of the term was in an article by August Wilhelm Hofmann in 1855. There is no general relationship between aromaticity as a chemical property and the olfactory properties of such compounds.

Aromaticity can also be considered a manifestation of cyclic delocalization and of resonance. This is usually considered to be because electrons are free to cycle around circular arrangements of atoms that are alternately single- and double-bonded to one another. This commonly seen model of aromatic rings, namely the idea that benzene was formed from a six-membered carbon ring with alternating single and double bonds (cyclohexatriene), was developed by Kekulé (see History section below). Each bond may be seen as a hybrid of a single bond and a double bond, every bond in the ring identical to every other. The model for benzene consists of two resonance forms, which corresponds to the double and single bonds superimposing to give rise to six one-and-a-half bonds. Benzene is a more stable molecule than would be expected without accounting for charge delocalization.

==Theory==

As is standard for resonance diagrams, a double-headed arrow is used to indicate that the two structures are not distinct entities, but merely hypothetical possibilities. Neither is an accurate representation of the &quot;actual&quot; compound, which is best represented by a hybrid (average) of these structures, which can be seen at right. A C=C bond is shorter than a C−C bond, but benzene is perfectly hexagonal—all six carbon-carbon bonds have the same length, intermediate between that of a single and that of a double bond.

A better representation is that of the circular π bond (Armstrong&#x27;s &quot;inner cycle&quot;), in which the electron density is evenly distributed through a π-bond above and below the ring. This model more correctly represents the location of electron density within the aromatic ring.

The single bonds are formed with electrons in line between the carbon nuclei — these are called σ-bonds. Double bonds consist of a σ-bond and a π-bond. The π-bonds are formed from overlap of atomic p-orbitals above and below the plane of the ring. The following diagram shows the positions of these p-orbitals:

Since they are out of the plane of the atoms, these orbitals can interact with each other freely, and become delocalized. This means that, instead of being tied to one atom of carbon, each electron is shared by all six in the ring. Thus, there are not enough electrons to form double bonds on all the carbon atoms, but the &quot;extra&quot; electrons strengthen all of the bonds on the ring equally. The resulting molecular orbital has π symmetry.

==History==

===Etymology===
The first known use of the word &quot;aromatic&quot; as a &quot;chemical&quot; term — namely, to apply to compounds that contain the phenyl radical — occurs in an article by August Wilhelm Hofmann in 1855. If this is indeed the earliest introduction of the term, it is curious that Hofmann says nothing about why he introduced an adjective indicating olfactory character to apply to a group of chemical substances only some of which have notable aromas. Also, many of the most odoriferous organic substances known are terpenes, which are not aromatic in the chemical sense. But terpenes and benzenoid substances do have a chemical characteristic in common, namely higher unsaturation indices than many aliphatic compounds, and Hofmann may not have been making a distinction between the two categories.

===The structure of the benzene ring===

In the 19th century, chemists found it puzzling that benzene could be so unreactive toward addition reactions, given its presumed high degree of unsaturation. The cyclohexatriene structure for benzene was first proposed by August Kekulé in 1865. Over the next few decades, most chemists readily accepted this structure, since it accounted for most of the known isomeric relationships of aromatic chemistry.

Between 1897 and 1906, J. J. Thomson, the discoverer of the electron, proposed three equivalent electrons between each carbon atom in benzene.

An explanation for the exceptional stability of benzene is conventionally attributed to Sir Robert Robinson, who was apparently the first (in 1925) to coin the term &quot;aromatic sextet&quot; as a group of six electrons that resists disruption.

In fact, this concept can be traced further back, via Ernest Crocker in 1922, to Henry Edward Armstrong, who in 1890 wrote &quot;the (six) centric affinities act within a cycle ... benzene may be represented by a double ring (&quot;sic&quot;) ... and when an additive compound is formed, the inner cycle of affinity suffers disruption, the contiguous carbon-atoms to which nothing has been attached of necessity acquire the ethylenic condition&quot;.

Here, Armstrong is describing at least four modern concepts. First, his &quot;affinity&quot; is better known nowadays as the electron, which was to be discovered only seven years later by J. J. Thomson. Second, he is describing electrophilic aromatic substitution, proceeding (third) through a Wheland intermediate, in which (fourth) the conjugation of the ring is broken. He introduced the symbol C centered on the ring as a shorthand for the &quot;inner cycle&quot;, thus anticipating Erich Clar&#x27;s notation. It is argued that he also anticipated the nature of wave mechanics, since he recognized that his affinities had direction, not merely being point particles, and collectively having a distribution that could be altered by introducing substituents onto the benzene ring (&quot;much as the distribution of the electric charge in a body is altered by bringing it near to another body&quot;).

The quantum mechanical origins of this stability, or aromaticity, were first modelled by Hückel in 1931. He was the first to separate the bonding electrons into sigma and pi electrons.

== Characteristics of aromatic (aryl) compounds ==
An aromatic (or aryl) compound contains a set of covalently bound atoms with specific characteristics:

# A delocalized conjugated π system, most commonly an arrangement of alternating single and double bonds
# Coplanar structure, with all the contributing atoms in the same plane
# Contributing atoms arranged in one or more rings
# A number of π delocalized electrons that is even, but not a multiple of 4. That is, 4n + 2 number of π electrons, where n=0, 1, 2, 3, and so on. This is known as Hückel&#x27;s Rule.

Whereas benzene is aromatic (6 electrons, from 3 double bonds), cyclobutadiene is not, since the number of π delocalized electrons is 4, which of course is a multiple of 4. The cyclobutadienide (2−) ion, however, is aromatic (6 electrons). An atom in an aromatic system can have other electrons that are not part of the system, and are therefore ignored for the 4n + 2 rule. In furan, the oxygen atom is sp² hybridized. One lone pair is in the π system and the other in the plane of the ring (analogous to C-H bond on the other positions). There are 6 π electrons, so furan is aromatic.

Aromatic molecules typically display enhanced chemical stability, compared to similar non-aromatic molecules. A molecule that can be aromatic will tend to alter its electronic or conformational structure to be in this situation. This extra stability changes the chemistry of the molecule. Aromatic compounds undergo electrophilic aromatic substitution and nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions, but not electrophilic addition reactions as happens with carbon-carbon double bonds.

Many of the earliest-known examples of aromatic compounds, such as benzene and toluene, have distinctive pleasant smells. This property led to the term &quot;aromatic&quot; for this class of compounds, and hence the term &quot;aromaticity&quot; for the eventually discovered electronic property.

The circulating π electrons in an aromatic molecule produce ring currents that oppose the applied magnetic field in NMR. The NMR signal of protons in the plane of an aromatic ring are shifted substantially further down-field than those on non-aromatic sp² carbons. This is an important way of detecting aromaticity. By the same mechanism, the signals of protons located near the ring axis are shifted up-field. 
Aromatic molecules are able to interact with each other in so-called π-π stacking: The π systems form two parallel rings overlap in a &quot;face-to-face&quot; orientation. Aromatic molecules are also able to interact with each other in an &quot;edge-to-face&quot; orientation: The slight positive charge of the substituents on the ring atoms of one molecule are attracted to the slight negative charge of the aromatic system on another molecule.

Planar monocyclic molecules containing 4n π electrons are called antiaromatic and are, in general, destabilized. Molecules that could be antiaromatic will tend to alter their electronic or conformational structure to avoid this situation, thereby becoming non-aromatic. For example, cyclooctatetraene (COT) distorts itself out of planarity, breaking π overlap between adjacent double bonds. Relatively recently, cyclobutadiene was discovered to adopt an asymmetric, rectangular configuration in which single and double bonds indeed alternate; there is no resonance and the single bonds are markedly longer than the double bonds, reducing unfavorable p-orbital overlap. This reduction of symmetry lifts the degeneracy of the two formerly non-bonding molecular orbitals, which by Hund&#x27;s rule forces the two unpaired electrons into a new, weakly bonding orbital (and also creates a weakly antibonding orbital). Hence, cyclobutadiene is non-aromatic; the strain of the asymmetric configuration outweighs the anti-aromatic destabilization that would afflict the symmetric, square configuration.

== Importance of aromatic compounds ==
Aromatic compounds play key roles in the biochemistry of all living things. The four aromatic amino acids histidine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine each serve as one of the 20 basic building-blocks of proteins. Further, all 5 nucleotides (adenine, thymine, cytosine, guanine, and uracil) that make up the sequence of the genetic code in DNA and RNA are aromatic purines or pyrimidines. The molecule heme contains an aromatic system with 22 π electrons. Chlorophyll also has a similar aromatic system.

Aromatic compounds are important in industry. Key aromatic hydrocarbons of commercial interest are benzene, toluene, &quot;ortho&quot;-xylene and &quot;para&quot;-xylene. About 35 million tonnes are produced worldwide every year. They are extracted from complex mixtures obtained by the refining of oil or by distillation of coal tar, and are used to produce a range of important chemicals and polymers, including styrene, phenol, aniline, polyester and nylon.

== Types of aromatic compounds ==
The overwhelming majority of aromatic compounds are compounds of carbon, but they need not be hydrocarbons.

=== Neutral homocyclics ===
Benzene, as well as most other annulenes (cyclodecapentaene excepted) with the formula CnHn where n ≥ 4 and is an even number, such as cyclotetradecaheptaene.

=== Heterocyclics ===
In heterocyclic aromatics (heteroaromats), one or more of the atoms in the aromatic ring is of an element other than carbon. This can lessen the ring&#x27;s aromaticity, and thus (as in the case of furan) increase its reactivity. Other examples include pyridine, pyrazine, imidazole, pyrazole, oxazole, thiophene, and their benzannulated analogs (benzimidazole, for example).

=== Polycyclics ===
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are molecules containing two or more simple aromatic rings fused together by sharing two neighboring carbon atoms (see also simple aromatic rings). Examples are naphthalene, anthracene, and phenanthrene.

=== Substituted aromatics ===
Many chemical compounds are aromatic rings with other functional groups attached. Examples include trinitrotoluene (TNT), acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), paracetamol, and the nucleotides of DNA.

=== Atypical aromatic compounds ===
Aromaticity is found in ions as well: the cyclopropenyl cation (2e system), the cyclopentadienyl anion (6e system), the tropylium ion (6e), and the cyclooctatetraene dianion (10e). Aromatic properties have been attributed to non-benzenoid compounds such as tropone. Aromatic properties are tested to the limit in a class of compounds called cyclophanes.

A special case of aromaticity is found in homoaromaticity where conjugation is interrupted by a single &quot;sp&quot;³ hybridized carbon atom.

When carbon in benzene is replaced by other elements in borabenzene, silabenzene, germanabenzene, stannabenzene, phosphorine or pyrylium salts the aromaticity is still retained. Aromaticity also occurs in compounds that are not carbon-based at all. Inorganic 6-membered-ring compounds analogous to benzene have been synthesized. Hexasilabenzene (Si6H6) and borazine (B3N3H6) are structurally analogous to benzene, with the carbon atoms replaced by another element or elements. In borazine, the boron and nitrogen atoms alternate around the ring. Quite recently, the aromaticity of planar Si56- rings occurring in the Zintl phase Li12Si7 was experimentally evidenced by Li solid state NMR.

Metal aromaticity is believed to exist in certain metal clusters of aluminium.

Möbius aromaticity occurs when a cyclic system of molecular orbitals, formed from pπ atomic orbitals and populated in a closed shell by 4n (n is an integer) electrons, is given a single half-twist to correspond to a Möbius strip. A π system with 4n electrons in a flat (non-twisted) ring would be anti-aromatic, and therefore highly unstable, due to the symmetry of the combinations of p atomic orbitals. By twisting the ring, the symmetry of the system changes and becomes allowed (see also Möbius–Hückel concept for details). Because the twist can be left-handed or right-handed, the resulting Möbius aromatics are &quot;dissymmetric&quot; or chiral. 
As of 2012, there is no proof that a Möbius aromatic molecule was synthesized.
Aromatics with two half-twists corresponding to the paradromic topologies were first suggested by Johann Listing. In carbo-benzene the ring bonds are extended with alkyne and allene groups.

==== Y-aromaticity ====

Y-aromaticity is a concept which was developed to explain the extraordinary stability and high basicity of the guanidinium cation. Guanidinium does not have a ring structure but has six π-electrons which are delocalized over the molecule. However, this concept is controversial and some authors have stressed different effects.

<text>The common tern (Sterna hirundo) is a seabird in the family Laridae. This bird has a circumpolar distribution, its four subspecies breeding in temperate and subarctic regions of Europe, Asia and North America. It is strongly migratory, wintering in coastal tropical and subtropical regions. Breeding adults have light grey upperparts, white to very light grey underparts, a black cap, orange-red legs, and a narrow pointed bill. Depending on the subspecies, the bill may be mostly red with a black tip or all black. There are several similar species, including the partly sympatric Arctic tern, which can be separated on plumage details, leg and bill colour, or vocalisations.

Breeding in a wider range of habitats than any of its relatives, the common tern nests on any flat, poorly vegetated surface close to water, including beaches and islands, and it readily adapts to artificial substrates such as floating rafts. The nest may be a bare scrape in sand or gravel, but it is often lined or edged with whatever debris is available. Up to three eggs may be laid, their dull colours and blotchy patterns providing camouflage on the open beach. Incubation is by both sexes, and the eggs hatch in around 21–22 days, longer if the colony is disturbed by predators. The downy chicks fledge in 22–28 days. Like most terns, this species feeds by plunge-diving for fish, either in the sea or in freshwater, but molluscs, crustaceans and other invertebrate prey may form a significant part of the diet in some areas.

Eggs and young are vulnerable to predation by mammals such as rats and American mink, and large birds including gulls, owls and herons. Common terns may be infected by lice, parasitic worms, and mites, although blood parasites appear to be rare. Its large population and huge breeding range mean that this species is classed as being of least concern, although numbers in North America have declined sharply in recent decades. Despite international legislation protecting the common tern, in some areas, populations are threatened by habitat loss, pollution, or the disturbance of breeding colonies.

==Taxonomy==
Terns are small to medium-sized seabirds closely related to the gulls, skimmers and skuas. They are gull-like in appearance, but typically have a lighter build, long pointed wings (which give them a fast, buoyant flight), a deeply forked tail, slender legs, and webbed feet. Most species are grey above and white below, and have a black cap which is reduced or flecked with white in the non-breeding season.

The common tern&#x27;s closest relatives appear to be the Antarctic tern, followed by the Eurasian Arctic and roseate terns. Genetic evidence suggests that the common tern may have diverged from an ancestral stock earlier than its relatives. No fossils are known from North America, and those claimed in Europe are of uncertain age and species.

The common tern was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under its current scientific name, &quot;Sterna hirundo&quot;. &quot;Stearn&quot; was used in Old English, and a similar word was used by the Frisians for the birds. &quot;Stearn&quot; appears in the poem &quot;The Seafarer&quot;, written around 1000 A.D. Linnaeus adopted this word for the genus name &quot;Sterna&quot;. The Latin for swallow is &quot;hirundo,&quot; and refers here to the tern&#x27;s superficial likeness to that unrelated bird, which has a similar light build and long forked tail. This resemblance also leads to the informal name &quot;sea swallow&quot;, recorded from at least the seventeenth century. The Scots names &quot;picktarnie&quot;, &quot;tarrock&quot; and their many variants are also believed to be onomatopoeic, derived from the distinctive call. Because of the difficulty in distinguishing the two species, all the informal common names are shared with the Arctic tern. There was some uncertainty whether &quot;Sterna hirundo&quot; should apply to the common tern or the arctic tern as the species are very similar and both occur in Sweden. In 1913, the Swedish zoologist Einar Lönnberg concluded that the binomial name &quot;Sterna hirundo&quot; applied to the common tern.

Four subspecies of the common tern are generally recognized, although &quot;S.h.minussensis&quot; is sometimes considered an intergrade between &quot;S.h.hirundo&quot; and &quot;S.h.longipennis&quot;.

==Description==

The nominate subspecies of the common tern is long, including a fork in the tail, with a wingspan. It weighs . Breeding adults have pale grey upperparts, very pale grey underparts, a black cap, orange-red legs, and a narrow pointed bill that can be mostly red with a black tip, or all black, depending on the subspecies. The common tern&#x27;s upper wings are pale grey, but as the summer wears on, the dark feather shafts of the outer flight feathers become exposed, and a grey wedge appears on the wings. The rump and tail are white, and on a standing bird the long tail extends no further than the folded wingtips, unlike the Arctic and roseate terns in which the tail protrudes beyond the wings. There are no significant differences between the sexes. In non-breeding adults, the forehead and underparts become white, the bill is all black or black with a red base, and the legs are dark red or black. The upper wings have an obvious dark area at the front edge of the wing, the carpal bar. Terns that have not bred successfully may moult into non-breeding adult plumage beginning in June, though late July is more typical, with the moult suspended during migration. There is also some geographical variation; Californian birds are often in non-breeding plumage during migration.

Juvenile common terns have pale grey upper wings with a dark carpal bar. The crown and nape are brown, and the forehead is ginger, wearing to white by autumn. The upper parts are ginger with brown and white scaling, and the tail lacks the adult&#x27;s long outer feathers. Birds in their first post-juvenile plumage, which normally remain in their wintering areas, resemble the non-breeding adult, but have a duskier crown, dark carpal bar, and often very worn plumage. By their second year, most young terns are either indistinguishable from adults, or show only minor differences such as a darker bill or white forehead.

The common tern is an agile flyer, capable of rapid turns and swoops, hovering, and vertical take-off. When commuting with fish, it flies close to the surface in a strong head wind, but above the water in a following wind. Unless migrating, normally it stays below , and averages in the absence of a tail wind. Its average flight speed during the nocturnal migration flight is at a height of .

===Moult===
Juveniles moult into adult plumage in its first October; first the head, tail, and body plumage is replaced, mostly by February, then the wing feathers. The primaries are replaced in stages; the innermost feathers moult first, then replacement is suspended during the southern winter (birds of this age staying in their wintering areas) and recommences in the autumn. In May to June of the second year, a similar moult sequence starts, with a pause during primary moult for birds that return north, but not for those that stay in the winter quarters. A major moult to adult breeding plumage occurs in the next February to June, between forty and ninety per cent of feathers being replaced. Old primary feathers wear away to reveal the blackish barbs beneath. The moult pattern means that the oldest feathers are those nearest the middle of the wing, so as the northern summer progresses, a dark wedge appears on the wing because of this feather ageing process.

Terns are unusual in the frequency in which they moult their primaries, which are replaced at least twice, occasionally three times in a year. The visible difference in feather age is accentuated in the greater ultraviolet reflectance of new primaries, and the freshness of the wing feathers is used by females in mate selection. Experienced females favour mates which best show their fitness through the quality of their wing feathers. Rarely, a very early moult at the nesting colony is linked to breeding failure, both the onset of moult and reproductive behaviour being linked to falling levels of the hormone prolactin.

===Similar species===
There are several terns of a similar size and general appearance to the common tern. A traditionally difficult species to separate is the Arctic tern, and until the key characteristics were clarified, distant or flying birds of the two species were often jointly recorded as &quot;commic terns&quot;. Although similar in size, the two terns differ in structure and flight. The common tern has a larger head, thicker neck, longer legs, and more triangular and stiffer wings than its relative, and has a more powerful, direct flight. Arctic terns have greyer underparts than the common variety, which makes its white cheeks more obvious, whereas the rump of the common tern can be greyish in non-breeding plumage, compared to the white of its relative. The common tern develops a dark wedge on the wings as the breeding season progresses, but the wings of the Arctic stay white throughout the northern summer. All the flight feathers of the Arctic tern are translucent against a bright sky, only the four innermost wing feathers of the common tern share this property. The trailing edge of the outer flight feathers is a thin black line in the Arctic tern, but thicker and less defined in the common. The bill of an adult common tern is orange-red with a black tip, except in black-billed &quot;S.h.longipennis&quot;, and its legs are bright red, while both features are a darker red colour in the Arctic tern, which also lacks the black bill tip.

In the breeding areas, the roseate tern can be distinguished by its pale plumage, long, mainly black bill and very long tail feathers. The non-breeding plumage of roseate is pale above and white, sometimes pink-tinged, below. It retains the long tail streamers, and has a black bill. In flight, the roseate&#x27;s heavier head and neck, long bill and faster, stiffer wingbeats are also characteristic. It feeds further out to sea than the common tern. In North America, the Forster&#x27;s tern in breeding plumage is obviously larger than the common, with relatively short wings, a heavy head and thick bill, and long, strong legs; in all non-breeding plumages, its white head and dark eye patch make the American species unmistakable.

In the wintering regions, there are also confusion species, including the Antarctic tern of the southern oceans, the South American tern, the Australasian white-fronted tern and the white-cheeked tern of the Indian Ocean. The plumage differences due to &quot;opposite&quot; breeding seasons may aid in identification. The Antarctic tern is more sturdy than the common, with a heavier bill. In breeding condition, its dusky underparts and full black cap outline a white cheek stripe. In non-breeding plumages, it lacks, or has only an indistinct, carpal bar, and young birds show dark bars on the tertials, obvious on the closed wing and in flight. The South American tern is larger than the common, with a larger, more curved red bill, and has a smoother, more extensive black cap in non-breeding plumage. Like Antarctic, it lacks a strong carpal bar in non-breeding plumages, and it also shares the distinctive barring of the tertials in young birds. The white-fronted tern has a white forehead in breeding plumage, a heavier bill, and in non-breeding plumage is paler below than the common, with white underwings. The white-cheeked tern is smaller, has uniform grey upperparts, and in breeding plumage is darker above with whiter cheeks.

Juvenile common terns are easily separated from similar-aged birds of related species. They show extensive ginger colouration to the back, and have a pale base to the bill. Young Arctic terns have a grey back and black bill, and juvenile roseate terns have a distinctive scalloped &quot;saddle&quot;. Hybrids between common and roseate terns have been recorded, particularly from the US, and the intermediate plumage and calls shown by these birds is a potential identification pitfall. Such birds may have more extensive black on the bill, but confirmation of mixed breeding may depend on the exact details of individual flight feathers.

===Voice===
Common terns have a wide repertoire of calls, which have a lower pitch than the equivalent calls of Arctic terns. The most distinctive sound is the alarm &quot;KEE-yah&quot;, stressed on the first syllable, in contrast to the second-syllable stress of the Arctic tern. The alarm call doubles up as a warning to intruders, although serious threats evoke a &quot;kyar&quot;, given as a tern takes flight, and quietens the usually noisy colony while its residents assess the danger. A down-slurred is given when an adult is approaching the nest while carrying a fish, and is possibly used for individual recognition (chicks emerge from hiding when they hear their parents giving this call). Another common call is a &quot;kip&quot; uttered during social contact. Other vocalizations include a &quot;kakakakaka&quot; when attacking intruders, and a staccato &quot;kek-kek-kek&quot; from fighting males.

Parents and chicks can locate one another by call, and siblings also recognise each other&#x27;s vocalisations from about the twelfth day from hatching, which helps to keep the brood together.

==Distribution and habitat==

Most populations of the common tern are strongly migratory, wintering south of their temperate and subarctic Northern Hemisphere breeding ranges. First summer birds usually remain in their wintering quarters, although a few return to breeding colonies some time after the arrival of the adults. In North America, the common tern breeds along the Atlantic coast from Labrador to North Carolina, and inland throughout much of Canada east of the Rocky Mountains. In the United States, some breeding populations can also be found in the states bordering the Great Lakes, and locally on the Gulf coast. There are small, only partially migratory, colonies in the Caribbean; these are in The Bahamas and Cuba, and off Venezuela in the Los Roques and Las Aves archipelagos.

New World birds winter along both coasts of Central and South America, to Argentina on the east coast and to northern Chile on the west coast. Records from South America and the Azores show that some birds may cross the Atlantic in both directions on their migration.

The common tern breeds across most of Europe, with the highest numbers in the north and east of the continent. There are small populations on the north African coast, and in the Azores, Canary Islands and Madeira. Most winter off western or southern Africa, birds from the south and west of Europe tending to stay north of the equator and other European birds moving further south. The breeding range continues across the temperate and taiga zones of Asia, with scattered outposts on the Persian Gulf and the coast of Iran. Small populations breed on islands off Sri Lanka, and in the Ladakh region of the Tibetan plateau. Western Asian birds winter in the northern Indian Ocean, and &quot;S.h.tibetana&quot; appears to be common off East Africa during the Northern Hemisphere winter. Birds from further north and east in Asia, such as &quot;S.h.longipennis&quot;, move through Japan, Thailand and the western Pacific as far as southern Australia. There are small and erratic colonies in West Africa, in Nigeria and Guinea-Bissau, unusual in that they are within what is mainly a wintering area. Only a few common terns have been recorded in New Zealand, and this species&#x27; status in Polynesia is unclear. A bird ringed at the nest in Sweden was found dead on Stewart Island, New Zealand, five months later, having flown an estimated 25,000km (15,000mi).

As long-distance migrants, common terns sometimes occur well outside their normal range. Stray birds have been found inland in Africa (Zambia and Malawi), and on the Maldives and Comoros islands; the nominate subspecies has reached Australia, the Andes, and the interior of South America. Asian &quot;S.h.longipennis&quot; has recent records from western Europe.

The common tern breeds over a wider range of habitats than any of its relatives, nesting from the taiga of Asia to tropical shores, and at altitudes up to in Armenia, and in Asia. It avoids areas which are frequently exposed to excessive rain or wind, and also icy waters, so it does not breed as far north as the Arctic tern. The common tern breeds close to freshwater or the sea on almost any open flat habitat, including sand or shingle beaches, firm dune areas, salt marsh, or, most commonly, islands. Flat grassland or heath, or even large flat rocks may be suitable in an island environment. In mixed colonies, common terns will tolerate somewhat longer ground vegetation than Arctic terns, but avoid the even taller growth acceptable to roseate terns; the relevant factor here is the different leg lengths of the three species. Common terns adapt readily to artificial floating rafts, and may even nest on flat factory roofs. Unusual nest sites include hay bales, a stump above the water, and floating logs or vegetation. There is a record of a common tern taking over a spotted sandpiper nest and laying its eggs with those of the wader. Outside the breeding season, all that is needed in terms of habitat is access to fishing areas, and somewhere to land. In addition to natural beaches and rocks, boats, buoys and piers are often used both as perches and as night-time roosts.

==Behaviour==
===Territory===
The common tern breeds in colonies which do not normally exceed two thousand pairs, but may occasionally number more than twenty thousand pairs. Colonies inland tend to be smaller than on the coast. Common terns often nest alongside other coastal species, such as Arctic, roseate and Sandwich terns, black-headed gulls, and black skimmers. Especially in the early part of the breeding season, for no known reason, most or all of the terns will fly in silence low and fast out to sea. This phenomenon is called a &quot;dread&quot;.

On their return to the breeding sites, the terns may loiter for a few days before settling into a territory, and the actual start of nesting may be linked to a high availability of fish. Terns defend only a small area, with distances between nests sometimes being as little as , although is more typical. As with many birds, the same site is re-used year after year, with a record of one pair returning for 17 successive breeding seasons. Around ninety per cent of experienced birds reuse their former territory, so young birds must nest on the periphery, find a bereaved mate, or move to another colony. A male selects a nesting territory a few days after his arrival in the spring, and is joined by his previous partner unless she is more than five days late, in which case the pair may separate.

Inbreeding among close &quot;S. hirundo&quot; relatives appears to be avoided passively by immigration and dispersal rather than by kin discrimination and mate choice.

The defence of the territory is mainly by the male, who repels intruders of either sex. He gives an alarm call, opens his wings, raises his tail and bows his head to show the black cap. If the intruder persists, the male stops calling and fights by bill grappling until the intruder submits by raising its head to expose the throat. Aerial trespassers are simply attacked, sometimes following a joint upward spiralling flight. Despite the aggression shown to adults, wandering chicks are usually tolerated, whereas in a gull colony they would be attacked and killed. The nest is defended until the chicks have fledged, and all the adults in the colony will collectively repel potential predators.

===Breeding===

Pairs are established or confirmed through aerial courtship displays in which a male and a female fly in wide circles up to or more, calling all the while, before the two birds descend together in zigzag glides. If the male is carrying a fish, he may attract the attention of other males too. On the ground, the male courts the female by circling her with his tail and neck raised, head pointing down, and wings partially open. If she responds, they may both adopt a posture with the head pointed skywards. The male may tease a female with the fish, not parting with his offering until she has displayed to him sufficiently. Once courtship is complete, the male makes a shallow depression in the sand, and the female scratches in the same place. Several trials may take place until the pair settle on a site for the actual nest. The eggs may be laid on bare sand, gravel or soil, but a lining of debris or vegetation is often added if available, or the nest may be rimmed with seaweed, stones or shells. The saucer-shaped scrape is typically deep and across, but may extend to as much as wide including the surrounding decorative material. Breeding success in areas prone to flooding has been enhanced by the provision of artificial mats made from eelgrass, which encourage the terns to nest in higher, less vulnerable areas, since many prefer the mats to bare sand. The common tern tends to use more nest material than roseate or Arctic terns, although roseate often nests in areas with more growing vegetation.

Terns are expert at locating their nests in a large colony. Studies show that terns can find and excavate their eggs when they are buried, even if the nest material is removed and the sand smoothed over. They will find a nest placed from its original site, or even further if it is moved in several stages. Eggs are accepted if reshaped with plasticine or coloured yellow (but not red or blue). This ability to locate the eggs is an adaptation to life in an unstable, wind-blown and tidal environment.

The peak time for egg production is early May, with some birds, particularly first-time breeders, laying later in the month or in June. The clutch size is normally three eggs; larger clutches probably result from two females laying in the same nest. Egg size averages , although each successive egg in a clutch is slightly smaller than the first laid. The average egg weight is , of which five per cent is shell. The egg weight depends on how well-fed the female is, as well as on its position in the clutch. The eggs are cream, buff, or pale brown, marked with streaks, spots or blotches of black, brown or grey which help to camouflage them. Incubation is by both sexes, although more often by the female, and lasts 21–22 days, extending to 25days if there are frequent disturbances at the colony which cause the adults to leave the eggs unattended; nocturnal predation may lead to incubation taking up to 34days. On hot days the incubating parent may fly to water to wet its belly feathers before returning to the eggs, thus affording the eggs some cooling. Except when the colony suffers disaster, ninety per cent of the eggs hatch. The precocial downy chick is yellowish with black or brown markings, and like the eggs, is similar to the equivalent stage of the Arctic tern. The chicks fledge in 22–28 days, usually 25–26. Fledged juveniles are fed at the nest for about five days, and then accompany the adults on fishing expeditions. The young birds may receive supplementary feeds from the parents until the end of the breeding season, and beyond. Common terns have been recorded feeding their offspring on migration and in the wintering grounds, at least until the adults move further south in about December.

Like many terns, this species is very defensive of its nest and young, and will harass humans, dogs, muskrats and most diurnal birds, but unlike the more aggressive Arctic tern, it rarely hits the intruder, usually swerving off at the last moment. Adults can discriminate between individual humans, attacking familiar people more intensely than strangers. Nocturnal predators do not elicit similar attacks; colonies can be wiped out by rats, and adults desert the colony for up to eight hours when great horned owls are present.

Common terns usually breed once a year. Second clutches are possible if the first is lost. Rarely, a second clutch may be laid and incubated while some chicks from the first clutch are still being fed. The first breeding attempt is usually at four years of age, sometimes at three years. The average number of young per pair surviving to fledging can vary from zero in the event of the colony being flooded to over 2.5 in a good year. In North America, productivity was between 1.0 and 2.0 on islands, but less than 1.0 at coastal and inland sites. Birds become more successful at raising chicks with age. This continues throughout their breeding lives, but the biggest increase is in the first five years. The maximum documented lifespan in the wild is 23years in North America and 33years in Europe, but twelve years is a more typical lifespan.

===Food and feeding===
Like all &quot;Sterna&quot; terns, the common tern feeds by plunge-diving for fish, from a height of , either in the sea or in freshwater lakes and large rivers. The bird may submerge for a second or so, but to no more than below the surface. When seeking fish, this tern flies head-down and with its bill held vertically. It may circle or hover before diving, and then plunges directly into the water, whereas the Arctic tern favours a &quot;stepped-hover&quot; technique, and the roseate tern dives at speed from a greater height, and submerges for longer. The common tern typically forages up to away from the breeding colony, sometimes as far as . It will follow schools of fish, and its west African migration route is affected by the location of huge shoals of sardines off the coast of Ghana; it will also track groups of predatory fish or dolphins, waiting for their prey to be driven to the sea&#x27;s surface. Terns often feed in flocks, especially if food is plentiful, and the fishing success rate in a flock is typically about one-third higher than for individuals.

Terns have red oil droplets in the cone cells of the retinas of their eyes. This improves contrast and sharpens distance vision, especially in hazy conditions. Birds that have to see through an air/water interface, such as terns and gulls, have more strongly coloured carotenoid pigments in the cone oil drops than other avian species. The improved eyesight helps terns to locate shoals of fish, although it is uncertain whether they are sighting the phytoplankton on which the fish feed, or observing other terns diving for food. Tern&#x27;s eyes are not particularly ultraviolet sensitive, an adaptation more suited to terrestrial feeders like the gulls.
The common tern preferentially hunts fish long. The species caught depend on what is available, but if there is a choice, terns feeding several chicks will take larger prey than those with smaller broods. The proportion of fish fed to chicks may be as high as ninety-five per cent in some areas, but invertebrate prey may form a significant part of the diet elsewhere. This may include worms, leeches, molluscs such as small squid, and crustaceans (prawns, shrimp and mole crabs). In freshwater areas, large insects may be caught, such as beetles, cockchafers and moths. Adult insects may be caught in the air, and larvae picked from the ground or from the water surface. Prey is caught in the bill and either swallowed head-first, or carried back to the chicks. Occasionally, two or more small fish may be carried simultaneously. When adults take food back to the nest, they recognise their young by call, rather than visual identification.

The common tern may attempt to steal fish from Arctic terns, but might itself be harassed by kleptoparasitic skuas, laughing gulls, roseate terns, or by other common terns while bringing fish back to its nest. In one study, two males whose mates had died spent much time stealing food from neighbouring broods.

Terns normally drink in flight, usually taking seawater in preference to freshwater, if both are available. Chicks do not drink before fledging, reabsorbing water, and, like adults, excreting excess salt in a concentrated solution from a specialised nasal gland. Fish bones and the hard exoskeletons of crustaceans or insects are regurgitated as pellets. Adults fly off the nest to defecate, and even small chicks walk a short distance from the scrape to deposit their faeces. Adults attacking animals (including humans) will often defecate as they dive, often successfully fouling the intruder.

==Predators and parasites==
Rats will take tern eggs, and may even store large numbers in caches, and the American mink is an important predator of hatched chicks, both in North America, and in Scotland where it has been introduced. The red fox can also be a local problem. Because common terns nest on islands, the most common predators are normally other birds rather than mammals. The ruddy turnstone will take eggs from unattended nests, and gulls may take chicks. Great horned owls and short-eared owls will kill both adults and chicks, and black-crowned night herons will also eat small chicks. Merlins and peregrine falcons may attack flying terns; as with other birds, it seems likely that one advantage of flocking behaviour is to confuse fast-flying predators.

The common tern hosts feather lice, which are quite different from those found in Arctic terns, despite the close relationship of the two birds. It may also be infected by parasitic worms, such as the widespread &quot;Diphyllobothrium&quot; species, the duck parasite &quot;Ligula intestinalis&quot;, and &quot;Schistocephalus&quot; species carried initially by fish. Tapeworms of the family Cyclophyllidea may also infect this species. The mite &quot;Reighardia sternae&quot; has been found in common terns from Italy, North America and China. A study of 75 breeding common terns found that none carried blood parasites. Colonies have been affected by avian cholera and ornithosis, and it is possible that the common tern may be threatened in the future by outbreaks of avian influenza to which it is susceptible. In 1961 the common tern was the first wild bird species identified as infected with avian influenza, the H5N3 variant being found in an outbreak of South African birds.

==Status==
The common tern is classed as least concern on the IUCN Red List. It has a large population of 1.6 to 3.3million mature individuals and a huge breeding range estimated at . Breeding numbers have been estimated at a quarter to half a million pairs, the majority breeding in Asia. About 140 thousand pairs breed in Europe. Fewer than eighty thousand pairs breed in North America, with most breeding on the northeast Atlantic coast and a declining population of less than ten thousand pairs breeding in the Great Lakes region.

In the nineteenth century, the use of tern feathers and wings in the millinery trade was the main cause of large reductions in common tern populations in both Europe and North America, especially on the Atlantic coasts and inland. Sometimes entire stuffed birds were used to make hats. Numbers largely recovered early in the twentieth century mainly due to legislation and the work of conservation organizations. Although some Eurasian populations are stable, numbers in North America have fallen by more than seventy per cent in the last forty years, and there is an overall negative trend in the global estimates for this species.

Threats come from habitat loss through building, pollution or vegetation growth, or disturbance of breeding birds by humans, vehicles, boats or dogs. Local natural flooding may lead to nest losses, and some colonies are vulnerable to predation by rats and large gulls. Gulls also compete with terns for nest sites. Some birds are hunted in the Caribbean for commercial sale as food. Breeding success may be enhanced by the use of floating nest rafts, manmade islands or other artificial nest sites, and by preventing human disturbance. Overgrown vegetation may be burned to clear the ground, and gulls can be killed or discouraged by deliberate disturbance. Contamination with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) resulted in enhanced levels of feminisation in male embryos, which seemed to disappear prior to fledging, with no effect on colony productivity, but dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), which results from the breakdown of DDT, led to very low levels of successful breeding in some US locations.

The common tern is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) and the US–Canada Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 apply. Parties to the AEWA agreement are required to engage in a wide range of conservation strategies described in a detailed action plan. The plan is intended to address key issues such as species and habitat conservation, management of human activities, research, education, and implementation. The North American legislation is similar, although there is a greater emphasis on protection.

<text>The University of Connecticut (UConn) is a public land-grant research university system with its main campus in Storrs, Connecticut, United States. It was founded in 1881 as the Storrs Agricultural School, named after two benefactors. In 1893, the school became a public land grant college, then took its current name in 1939. Over the following decade, social work, nursing, and graduate programs were established. During the 1960s, UConn Health was established for new medical and dental schools. UConn is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.

With more than 32,000 students, the University of Connecticut is the largest university in Connecticut by enrollment. The university is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;. UConn is one of the founding institutions of the Hartford-Springfield regional economic and cultural partnership alliance known as New England&#x27;s Knowledge Corridor. UConn was the second U.S. university invited into Universitas 21, an international network of research-intensive universities. 

The school&#x27;s athletic teams compete in the Big East Conference as the Huskies. UConn has gained notable recognition for its women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s basketball programs and are often considered &quot;blue bloods&quot; in the sport. The Connecticut Huskies are the top women&#x27;s basketball program in the nation, having won a record 11 NCAA Division I National Championships (tied with the UCLA Bruins men&#x27;s basketball team) and a women&#x27;s record four in a row (2013–2016), in addition to over 40 conference regular season and tournament championships. Across all sports, the Huskies have collectively won 23 NCAA championships.

==History==
UConn was founded in 1881 as the Storrs Agricultural School. It was named after Charles and Augustus Storrs, brothers who donated the land for the school as well as initial funding. The Storrs Agricultural Experiment Station was founded in 1887. Women began attending classes in 1891 and were officially admitted in 1893, the same year that it became Connecticut&#x27;s land-grant college and was renamed Storrs Agricultural College. In 1899, the name changed again to Connecticut Agricultural College, and, in 1933, to Connecticut State College. In its current form, the College of Agriculture is the oldest of the university&#x27;s colleges and professional schools.

On May 26, 1939, Governor Raymond E. Baldwin signed the bill that allowed Connecticut State College to have its name changed to the University of Connecticut. The following year, trustees organized and developed a plan to divide the university into separate schools and colleges in Business, Education, Home Economics, Colleges of Arts and Sciences, and College of Agriculture. This was also the year the School of Social Work and School of Nursing were established. Master&#x27;s degrees had been awarded since 1920, but the Graduate School was established after the reorganization of the schools in 1940, as well as the Doctoral Program for graduates which was authorized in 1943. PhDs have been awarded since 1949. The schools of law and pharmacy were also absorbed into the university.

In 1958, the School of Education established the first high school in the town of Mansfield, E. O. Smith High School, as a laboratory school for teacher training and education research. The high school, which lies adjacent to campus, was operated by the University of Connecticut until 1987, when it became the regional public high school. E.O. Smith has maintained an Agricultural Science education program since its time as a part of UConn, and junior and senior high school students may take classes for credit on UConn&#x27;s campus.

During the 1970s, UConn Health was established in Farmington as a home for the new School of Medicine and School of Dental Medicine. John Dempsey Hospital opened in Farmington in 1975 and has been operated by UConn ever since.

In 1995, a state-funded program called UConn 2000 was passed by the Connecticut General Assembly and signed into law by then-Governor John G. Rowland. This 10-year program set aside $1 billion to upgrade campus facilities, add faculty, and otherwise improve the university. An additional $1.3 billion was pledged by the State of Connecticut in 2002 as part of a new ten-year improvement plan known as 21st Century UConn.

An agreement was reached in 2012 to launch Jackson Laboratory&#x27;s $1.1 billion genomic medicine lab on the Farmington UConn Health campus as part of the Bioscience Connecticut initiative. In 2013, Governor Dannel P. Malloy signed into law Next Generation Connecticut, committing $1.7 billion in funding over a decade to enhance UConn&#x27;s infrastructure, hire additional faculty, and upgrade STEM initiatives.

Two U.S. presidents have visited the Storrs campus during their term of office, Bill Clinton in 1995 and Joe Biden in 2021, to dedicate the first and second iterations of the Dodd Center for Human Rights, respectively. The Dodd Center has brought an array of other world figures to the campus including Madeleine Albright, Elie Wiesel, Oscar Arias, and Mikhail Gorbachev. Presidents Gerald Ford and George H. W. Bush visited the campus after leaving office.

==Campuses==

===Storrs campus===
The primary and original UConn campus is in Storrs, a division of the Town of Mansfield, east of Hartford, Connecticut&#x27;s capital, and bordered by the towns of Ashford, Coventry, Willington, and Windham. The campus is easily accessible from nearby thoroughfares US Route 6 in Windham and Interstate 84 in Tolland. 

====Libraries====
The University of Connecticut Libraries form the largest public research collection in the state. The main library is the Homer D. Babbidge Library, on Fairfield Way in the center of campus. In 1882, Charles Storrs donated the first volumes to the university library collection (specifically, of the agriculture school). The university formerly housed its primary library collections in the Old Whitney building, one of the first agriculture school buildings. The library migrated from Old Main to the basement of Beech Hall in 1929. The university&#x27;s first librarian was Edwina Whitney, who served from 1900 to 1934. The library then moved to the Wilbur Cross Building and remained there until the 1970s. The current main library, Homer Babbidge, was formerly known as the Nathan Hale Library. It underwent renovations completed in 1998; at the time it was the largest public research library in New England.

The Storrs campus is also home to the university&#x27;s Music and Pharmacy libraries, and the Thomas J. Dodd Research Center, home to the university&#x27;s archives and special collections. Each of the regional campuses also have their own libraries. These libraries are tied into the Babbidge library through a shared catalogue.

The Babbidge-based collection places UConn among the top 30 universities in the nation for library holdings and funding, containing more than 2.5 million print volumes, approximately 2,500 current print periodicals, more than 35,000 journals through the eJournal locator, 2.8 million units of microfilm, 180,000 maps at the Map and Geographic Information Center (New England&#x27;s largest public map collection), millions of electronic books, and an array of free electronic information sources. The UCL also license approximately 265 electronic search databases, many of which contain the full-text of research journals, monographs, and historic documents.

The Lyman Maynard Stowe Library, housed at UConn Health, was one of eight federally funded National Network of Libraries of Medicine libraries from 1991 to 2001. The University of Connecticut School of Law houses the School of Law Library at its campus in Hartford. The Stowe and Law libraries have catalogues separate from the Babbidge system, making the total library holdings of the University of Connecticut much higher than the 2.5 million print volumes of Babbidge. UConn participates in several outside library consortia, including the New England Law Library Consortium and the Northeast Research Libraries Consortium. The Dodd Research Center has also formed a partnership with the African National Congress to share materials with South African scholars.

====Campus====
The UConn campus at Storrs is home to the Connecticut Repertory Theatre (CRT) run by the Department of Dramatic Arts. The theatre complex has three venues, the 486-seat Harriet S. Jorgensen Theatre, the 241-seat Nafe Katter Theatre, and the 116-seat Studio Theatre. CRT is a member of the Theatre Communications Group, the national service organization for the professional theatre. The Storrs campus also houses the J. Louis von der Mehden Recital Hall, the William Benton Museum of Art, and the Ballard Institute and Museum of Puppetry. 

In the 1960s, drama students from UConn participated in Theatre on Tour, which was an initiative to bring dramatic performances to &quot;bring live drama to grass-roots theatre fans&quot; across New England. They performed &quot;Lady Windemere&#x27;s Fan&quot;, for instance, at Hotchkiss School in 1968.

UConn is the only institution in the United States that offers a master&#x27;s degree in puppetry.

Among the research facilities on campus is the George Safford Torrey Life Sciences Building. Built in 1961, in 1980 the building was named in honor of the former head of the botany department. The Torrey Life Sciences Building houses offices for the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, the Department of Physiology and Neurobiology, the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, and Biology Central Services.

Because it is situated in a fairly rural area, the UConn campus has facilities that allow it to be virtually self-sufficient. All heat on campus is steam, and where possible sidewalks were laid over the underground connectors to keep the snow off. In 2005, a cogeneration plant was activated, which generates most of the electricity for the campus, and uses the exhaust steam for the campus central heating system. The university owns its own public water system and waste water treatment facility. With the support of local industry, UConn is also developing and using fuel cell technology. In April 2012, UConn commissioned a fuel cell power plant at its Depot Campus that will supply the campus with clean and efficiency energy, cooling and heating. The installation of a ClearEdge Power, formerly UTC Power, PureCell System was made possible through a federal stimulus grant from Connecticut&#x27;s Clean Energy Finance and Investment Authority (now the Connecticut GreenBank).

The University of Connecticut Police Department is a fully functional police agency with the same statutory authority as any municipal police department in the State of Connecticut. State and internationally accredited, the department is responsible for protecting lives and property at the University of Connecticut and all adjacent areas within the jurisdiction of the UConn Police Department. This includes the main campus in Storrs and the regional campuses. The UConn Division of Public Safety also includes the UConn Fire Department, and Office of the Fire Marshal and Building Inspectors. UConn campuses are equipped with a blue-light system which allows students to press an emergency button which will notify the police to come to that location.

Next Generation Connecticut is a multi-faceted $1.5 billion plan to build the state&#x27;s economic future through strategic investments in science, technology, engineering, and math disciplines (STEM). It passed the Connecticut General Assembly and was signed into law by Governor Dannel Malloy in 2013. The funds will be used over a 10-year period to hire 250+ new faculty, increase undergraduate enrollment by 6,580 students, and upgrade aging campus infrastructure. Money has also been allocated to build new STEM facilities, construct new STEM teaching laboratories and to create a premier STEM honors college. NextGenCT will also allow for the construction of student housing and a digital media center at the Stamford campus, and allow for the relocation of the Greater Hartford campus back to downtown Hartford.

===Avery Point campus===
UConn&#x27;s Avery Point campus overlooks Long Island Sound in the town of Groton. It is home to the National Undersea Research Center, the Connecticut Sea Grant College, Project Oceanology, the Long Island Sound Resource Center, and the Alexey von Schlippe Gallery of Art. The campus has undergone a transformation in recent years, including new Marine Science and Project Oceanology buildings, a new research vessel, and renovations of the Branford House, the gymnasium, and the main Academic Building.
The campus was formerly the summer home of Morton Freeman Plant, a 19th-century railroad, steamship, and hotel magnate. Branford House was his mansion overlooking Long Island Sound, completed in 1904. The estate included what is now the Shennecossett Public Golf Course, which was turned over to the State of Connecticut in the 1930s. During World War II, the remaining portion of the Plant estate was leased to the Coast Guard as a training center, and the Avery Point Light was built. It was later converted into the University of Connecticut at Avery Point.

===Stamford campus===
In 1951, the University of Connecticut began offering extension courses at the former Stamford High School to provide education for GIs returning from the Korean War. In the fall of 1952, the university formally established a regional campus in Stamford. Upon inception, UConn&#x27;s Stamford Campus offered five courses — English, Mathematics, History, Speech, and Sociology, and enrolled 21 part-time students.

A newly constructed UConn Stamford Campus opened in 1962 on Scofield Town Road, and a separate library building was added in 1974. Also in the mid-1970s, the academic program was expanded to provide a four-year degree in several fields of study.

In 1990, planning began for a new UConn Stamford Campus in the heart of downtown Stamford. One of the first UConn 2000 building projects, the new campus opened in 1998, offering a variety of academic programs including undergraduate and graduate degrees. The contemporary glass-enclosed campus features a high-tech approach to learning with internet access in classrooms, laboratories, student amenities and public spaces. Design for the new UConn building was led by Aaron Schwarz, then of Perkins Eastman.

In August 2017, UConn&#x27;s first-ever permanent residence hall for students outside the Storrs campus was opened at Stamford. The six-story, 116 unit building is intended to house 290 students.

===Hartford campus===
In August 2017, UConn formally opened its new campus in downtown Hartford, after nearly 40 years in neighboring West Hartford. The new campus is located within Hartford&#x27;s Front Street neighborhood—a portion of the Adriaen&#x27;s Landing project. The centerpiece of the new campus is the historic Beaux-Arts, which had been the former headquarters of the &quot;Hartford Times&quot;.

UConn Hartford offers a wide range of liberal arts and sciences courses and degrees to over 1,400 undergraduate and more than 600 graduate students. Due to the UConn Hartford&#x27;s proximity to the State Capitol and legislative offices, the university&#x27;s School of Public Policy is based at the Hartford campus. 

The University of Connecticut&#x27;s School of Social Work, established in 1948, sits alongside the University’s Hartford Campus. 

Located at Constitution Plaza in downtown Hartford, the UConn School of Business Graduate Business Learning Center offers three MBA programs as well as graduate degree programs and graduate certificate programs.

===Waterbury campus===
In 1942, the University of Connecticut was invited to Waterbury at the request of a group of citizens, headed by the Waterbury YMCA. Named the Waterbury Extension Center, it offered primarily certificate-granting technical courses taught at the YMCA for 253 students who were mostly of returning veterans looking for an affordable and easily accessible means of earning and education. Gradually, as the demand for courses grew, and enrollment increased, certain facilities at Leavenworth High School were used. Each semester about a dozen undergraduate courses were offered and a sizeable non-credit program was added. Four years later in the fall of 1946, the local Advisory Committee, working with the local Board of Education, secured the Begnal School on Charles Street.

In addition to the facilities on Charles Street, the Central YMCA allocated some space in their building for evening classes. The enrollment during this period increased to 662 students in the fall of 1947 and the establishment of an accredited, full-time undergraduate program, at the newly designated Waterbury Branch of the University of Connecticut.

In August 2003, the Waterbury campus moved to a new 95,000 square foot downtown campus. The U-shaped, three-story building at the intersection of East Main Street and Phoenix Avenue was designed to serve more than 1,200 students, faculty and staff, replacing the collection of buildings and houses that has served the Waterbury campus for decades. The new facility was dedicated on October 9, 2003. In January 2016, UConn Waterbury dedicated the newly renovated St. Patrick&#x27;s Hall also known as the Rectory as the newest addition to its campus. The Rectory Building added two floors of classroom and office space with the fourth floor of the building serving as both a classroom and event space.

The University of Connecticut&#x27;s Waterbury campus serves more than 1,000 students annually and offers nine four-year undergraduate degrees.

===Torrington campus===
The University of Connecticut at Torrington, founded in 1957, was closed in May 2016 due to low enrollment numbers.

===Jackson Laboratory===
In January 2012, Governor Malloy announced that Jackson Laboratory (JAX) had reached an agreement to launch a $1.1 billion genomic medicine laboratory on the campus of UConn Health. The laboratory is an independent, nonprofit biomedical research institution based in Bar Harbor, Maine.

According to the agreement, Jackson Laboratory will enter into a collaborative research agreement with UConn Health and will create at least 300 positions within 10 years, 30 percent of total employees being senior scientist positions. Once fully developed, the facility is projected to employ 600 scientists and technicians. The state of Connecticut has approved $291 million of the total capital and research budget; Jackson Laboratory will raise the balance of $860 million through federal research grants, philanthropy, and service income.

==Academics==
The University of Connecticut is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.

===Undergraduate===
Students at UConn can pursue over 100 majors, eight undergraduate degrees, 17 graduate degrees and five professional degree programs. Students choose from 87 different minors at UConn, including areas of study not offered as formalized majors.

UConn participates in the New England Board of Higher Education&#x27;s Regional Student Program (NERSP), allowing students from the five other New England states to enroll at the university at a reduced out-of-state tuition rate if their intended major is not offered by one of their in-state universities. The university also participates in a special guaranteed admissions program with the Connecticut Community Colleges (CCC) that is designed for academically qualified students who are attending a Connecticut community college and who are planning to transfer to the University of Connecticut in Liberal Arts &amp; Sciences, Agriculture, Health &amp; Natural Resources, Business, or Engineering. Each year, more than 1,000 transfer students are admitted to the university.

====Undergraduate admission, retention, and graduation====
, of the entering freshman at the main campus, 54% ranked in the top tenth of their high school class and 89% in the top quarter. UConn&#x27;s retention rate is among the best for public universities in the nation, with 93% of students returning for their year. UConn ranks third out of 58 public research universities on basis of graduation time, with the average time to graduate being 4.2 years among those who graduate within 6 years.

===Graduate and postgraduate===
Bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctoral programs are offered through the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, College of Agriculture, Health, and Natural Resources, the Graduate School, the Neag School of Education, the School of Nursing, the School of Business, the School of Dental Medicine, the School of Medicine, the School of Engineering, the School of Social Work, the Ratcliffe Hicks School of Agriculture, the School of Pharmacy, the School of Law and the School of Fine Arts. 

Founded in 1921, the University of Connecticut School of Law is accredited by the American Bar Association and is a member of the Association of American Law Schools. The campus is located just outside the downtown core of Hartford, minutes away from the Connecticut State Capitol, state courts and agencies, and the offices of Hartford&#x27;s law firms and corporations. Law students have ready access to all of these institutions for study, externships, clinical education, practice, and employment. The campus is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Its gothic-style buildings, constructed in 1925 (except for the new library, which was completed in 1996), housed the Hartford Seminary until 1981.

The law school has approximately 325 students and a student:faculty ratio of 4.1:1. UConn Law has repeatedly been ranked the top public law school in New England by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, and was most recently in 2020 ranked 52nd of American law schools. There are four scholarly journals edited on campus: the &quot;Connecticut Law Review,&quot; the &quot;Connecticut Public Interest Law Journal&quot;, the &quot;Connecticut Insurance Law Journal&quot;, and the &quot;Connecticut Journal of International Law&quot;. 
===Research===
According to the National Science Foundation, UConn spent $269 million on research and development in 2018, ranking it 88th in the nation. In 2005, UConn ranked 64th in terms of R&amp;D expenditure.

===Rankings and reputation===



*The university was ranked tied for 23rd among public universities in the U.S. and tied for 63rd among national universities in 2021 by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;.
* &quot;Kiplinger&#x27;s Personal Finance&quot; named UConn the 33rd best value in public higher education for 2019 (26th on the basis of out-of-state tuition).
* The University of Connecticut was among the top 10 producers of Fulbright Scholars from research institutions in 2017.
* The 2015 Sierra Club &quot;Cool Schools&quot; list of environmentally responsible universities ranked UConn eighth in the U.S.

==Student life==

===Student organizations===
There is a wide variety of student organizations on campus, including fraternities and sororities, musical groups, and religious, athletic, political, cultural, business, military, artistic, and community service clubs. 

The university&#x27;s daily student-run newspaper, &quot;The Daily Campus&quot;, is one of the longest continually-published college newspapers in the nation and serves as the primary news source for students and the greater campus area. WHUS FM 91.7, UConn&#x27;s student-run radio station, serves a similar function providing entertainment programming.

Multiple organizations program student-focused events through funding obtained from student fees, including an undergraduate student government and a group of students who host events at the school&#x27;s student union.

Since 2003, UConn has established university-owned Greek housing in the &quot;Husky Village,&quot; created an Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life, and hired full-time staff to administer a Greek Life program.

===Symbols===
Until 1933, the mascot of UConn had been the &quot;Aggies&quot;, because of the university&#x27;s original agricultural nature. In 1933, the university changed its name from Connecticut Agricultural College to Connecticut State College. To reflect this change, athletic teams were then known as the &quot;Statesmen&quot;. In December 1934, the Husky was chosen as the mascot.

Jonathan the Husky, the school&#x27;s mascot, is portrayed both as a traditional anthropomorphic character at athletic and student events and by a real Siberian husky dog. Jonathan received his name as part of a student newspaper poll in 1935 after Jonathan Trumbull, the last colonial governor of Connecticut.

The school&#x27;s fight song, officially titled &quot;UConn Husky&quot; was written by Herbert A. France. It is one of the most recognizable in the country, played by the Pride of Connecticut, UConn&#x27;s marching band, during the school&#x27;s sporting events. Many of UConn&#x27;s athletic events are nationally broadcast, owing to the song&#x27;s recognizability. A later version of the song was arranged by UConn music professor Dr. David Maker.

===Traditions===
The main UConn campus is also home to a &quot;spirit rock&quot;, which has been painted to promote student events and ideologies since the 1940s. The current rock is a portion of a much larger outcropping that was originally located across from the North Campus quadrangle and removed for construction of the Life Sciences building in 1958. In subsequent years, it was put into storage during the UCONN 2000 construction program and later re-located in 2008, 2013 and 2024.

UConn officials measured the paint&#x27;s depth with a small drill in fall 2018 and determined 1.25 inches of paint had accumulated on the rock since it was placed on that site in 2008.

Student organizations regularly host annual events, including concerts, pep rallies, guest speaker engagements, and social events like &quot;One Ton Sundae&quot; wherein students receive free scoops from a large quantity of ice cream.

===Community and tourism===
The town of Mansfield&#x27;s &quot;downtown&quot; area developments have been popular with UConn students, nearby residents, and visitors. Developed as a long-term construction project in the early 2000s, the &quot;downtown&quot; area is designed to be a mixed-use town center that includes retail shops, restaurants, offices, and housing. Current notable tenants include a Price Chopper supermarket, restaurants, and a co-branded UConn book store operated by Barnes and Noble.

Students are eligible for free in-state bus and rail transportation as part of the U-Pass program from the Connecticut Department of Transportation. Student groups also regularly organize excursion trips to local and regional destinations.

The main university campus also includes attractions such as the Jorgensen Center for the Performing Arts, the J. Robert Donnelly Husky Heritage Sports Museum, the William Benton Museum of Art, the Ballard Institute and Museum of Puppetry and the Connecticut State Museum of Natural History. The UConn Dairy Bar, an ice cream parlor and creamery attached to the school&#x27;s agricultural program, has been operational since the 1950s and is often regarded as serving the state&#x27;s best ice cream. It serves roughly 200,000 customers annually.

===Campus safety===
In 2014, the University of Connecticut and Brown University had the highest &quot;total of reports of rape&quot; on their main campus, with 43 each. A 2016 study showed, however, that rates of sexual violence at the university were lower than the national average.

==Athletics==


The University of Connecticut athletic teams are nicknamed the &quot;Huskies&quot; and compete at the NCAA&#x27;s Division I level and in the Football Bowl Subdivision. UConn moved to the American Athletic Conference in most sports in 2013; the Huskies were a charter member of The American when it was founded in 1979 as the original Big East Conference, and were the only remaining charter member of that league. In 2019, UConn accepted a formal invitation to join the Big East Conference following a unanimous vote of the conference&#x27;s members. The Huskies will begin playing in the Big East in the 2020–2021 season in all twenty sports except for football and men&#x27;s/women&#x27;s ice hockey. UConn men&#x27;s ice hockey became a full member of Hockey East in 2014–15. The women&#x27;s hockey team will remain in the Hockey East as well, as they were founding conference members in 2002 when the league began women&#x27;s ice hockey competition. The football program will not be returning to the AAC and will begin play as an FBS Independent starting in the 2020–2021 season. Regardless of football conference affiliation, the school has publicly committed to competing in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision for the foreseeable future. 

UConn is well known for its men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams, both of which are considered among the best programs in the country. The men&#x27;s basketball teams have won several National Championships, as have the women&#x27;s. UConn is the only Division I school to win the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball titles in the same year, and has done it twice: in 2004 and 2014. These accolades have earned Connecticut the popular nickname &quot;Basketball Capital of the World.&quot;

The university elevated its football program to the Football Bowl Subdivision in 2002, although the school first fielded a team in 1896. UConn became the quickest program to go from FBS elevation to a Bowl Championship Series game when it played in the 2011 Tostitos Fiesta Bowl. UConn has now played in a total of six bowl games. With the growth of the football program, in 2003 UConn football moved to 38,000-seat Rentschler Field in East Hartford, CT to host its home games.

UConn&#x27;s updated Husky logo, designed by Nike, has appeared on all athletic uniforms since the fall 2013 season.

<text>Product management is the business process of planning, developing, launching, and managing a product or service. It includes the entire lifecycle of a product, from ideation to development to go to market. Product managers are responsible for ensuring that a product meets the needs of its target market and contributes to the business strategy, while managing a product or products at all stages of the product lifecycle. Software product management adapts the fundamentals of product management for digital products.

== History ==

The concept of product management originates from a 1931 memo by Procter &amp; Gamble President Neil H. McElroy. McElroy, requesting additional employees focused on brand management, needed &quot;Brand Men&quot; who would take on the role of managing products, packaging, positioning, distribution, and sales performance. 

The memo defined a brand man&#x27;s work as:

* Study carefully the shipments of his brands by units.
* Where brand development is heavy ... examine carefully the combination of effort that seems to be clicking, and try to apply this same treatment to other territories.
* Where brand development is light:
** Study the advertising and promotion history of the brand.
** After uncovering our weaknesses, develop a plan that can be applied to this local sore spot.
** Outline this plan in detail for the division manager.
** Prepare sales helps and all other necessary material for carrying out the plan.
** Keep whatever records are necessary and make whatever field studies are necessary to determine whether the plan has produced the expected results.
* Take full responsibility ... for the general printed word plans for his brands.
* Take full responsibility for all other advertising expenditures.
* Experiment with and recommend wrapper revisions.
* Sees district manager a number of times a year to discuss with him any possible faults in our promotion plans for that territory.

In modern terms, McElroy defined the role as: analyzing product distribution, optimize working distribution strategies, diagnosing and solving distribution issues, optimize product positioning and product marketing, and collaborate with regional distribution managers.

== Role of product managers ==

Product managers are responsible for managing a company&#x27;s product line on a day-to-day basis. As a result, product managers are critical in driving a company&#x27;s growth, margins, and revenue. They are responsible for the business case, conceptualizing, planning, product development, product marketing, and delivering products to their target market. Depending on the company&#x27;s size, industry, and history, product management has a variety of functions and roles. Frequently there is an income statement (or profit and loss) responsibility as a key metric for evaluating product manager performance. 

=== Tasks ===
Product managers analyze information including customer research, competitive intelligence, industry analysis, trends, economic signals, and competitive activity, as well as documenting requirements, setting product strategy, and creating the roadmap. Product managers align across departments within their company including product design and development, marketing, sales, customer support, and legal.

<doc id="239851" wikidata="Q2845197" url="?curid=239851" title="Constructive analysis">
<text>In mathematics, constructive analysis is mathematical analysis done according to some principles of constructive mathematics.

==Introduction==
The name of the subject contrasts with &quot;classical analysis&quot;, which in this context means analysis done according to the more common principles of classical mathematics. However, there are various schools of thought and many different formalizations of constructive analysis. Whether classical or constructive in some fashion, any such framework of analysis axiomatizes the real number line by some means, a collection extending the rationals and with an apartness relation definable from an asymmetric order structure. Center stage takes a positivity predicate, here denoted formula_1, which governs an equality-to-zero formula_2. The members of the collection are generally just called the &quot;real numbers&quot;. While this term is thus overloaded in the subject, all the frameworks share a broad common core of results that are also theorems of classical analysis.

Constructive frameworks for its formulation are extensions of Heyting arithmetic by types including formula_3, constructive second-order arithmetic, or strong enough topos-, type- or constructive set theories such as formula_4, a constructive counter-part of formula_5. Of course, a direct axiomatization may be studied as well.

==Logical preliminaries==
The base logic of constructive analysis is intuitionistic logic, which means that the principle of excluded middle formula_6 is not automatically assumed for every proposition. If a proposition formula_7 is provable, this exactly means that the non-existence claim formula_8 being provable would be absurd, and so the latter cannot also be provable in a consistent theory. The double-negated existence claim is a logically negative statement and implied by, but generally not equivalent to the existence claim itself. Much of the intricacies of constructive analysis can be framed in terms of the weakness of propositions of the logically negative form formula_9, which is generally weaker than formula_10. In turn, also an implication formula_11 can generally be not reversed.

While a constructive theory proves fewer theorems than its classical counter-part in its classical presentation, it may exhibit attractive meta-logical properties. For example, if a theory formula_12 exhibits the disjunction property, then if it proves a disjunction formula_13 then also formula_14 or formula_15. Already in classical arithmetic, this is violated for the most basic propositions about sequences of numbers - as demonstrated next.

===Undecidable predicates===
A common strategy of formalization of real numbers is in terms of sequences or rationals, formula_16 and so we draw motivation and examples in terms of those. So to define terms, consider a decidable predicate on the naturals, which in the constructive vernacular means formula_17 is provable, and let formula_18 be the characteristic function defined to equal formula_19 exactly where formula_20 is true. 
The associated sequence formula_21 is monotone, with values non-strictly growing between the bounds formula_19 and formula_23. 
Here, for the sake of demonstration, defining an extensional equality to the zero sequence formula_24, it follows that formula_25. Note that the symbol &quot;formula_19&quot; is used in several contexts here. For any theory capturing arithmetic, there are many yet undecided and even provenly independent such statements formula_27. Two formula_28-examples are the Goldbach conjecture and the Rosser sentence of a theory. 

Consider any theory formula_29 with quantifiers ranging over primitive recursive, rational-valued sequences. Already minimal logic proves the non-contradiction claim for any proposition, and that the negation of excluded middle for any given proposition would be absurd. This also means there is no consistent theory (even if anti-classical) rejecting the excluded middle disjunction for any given proposition. Indeed, it holds that
:formula_30
This theorem is logically equivalent to the non-existence claim of a sequence for which the excluded middle disjunction about equality-to-zero would be disprovable. No sequence with that disjunction being rejected can be exhibited.
Assume the theories at hand are consistent and arithmetically sound. Now Gödel&#x27;s theorems mean that there is an explicit sequence formula_31 such that, for any fixed precision, formula_29 proves the zero-sequence to be a good approximation to formula_33, but it can also meta-logically be established that formula_34 as well as formula_35. Here this proposition formula_36 again amounts to the proposition of universally quantified form.
Trivially
:formula_37
even if these disjunction claims here do not carry any information. In the absence of further axioms breaking the meta-logical properties, constructive entailment instead generally reflects provability. Taboo statements that ought not be decidable (if the aim is to respect the provability interpretation of constructive claims) can be designed for definitions of a custom equivalence &quot;formula_38&quot; in formalizations below as well. For implications of disjunctions of yet not proven or disproven propositions, one speaks of weak Brouwerian counterexamples.

===Order vs. disjunctions===
The theory of the real closed field may be axiomatized such that all the non-logical axioms are in accordance with constructive principles. This concerns a commutative ring with postulates for a positivity predicate formula_39, with a positive unit and non-positive zero, i.e., formula_40 and formula_41. In any such ring, one may define formula_42, which constitutes a strict total order in its constructive formulation (also called linear order or, to be explicit about the context, a pseudo-order). As is usual, formula_43 is defined as formula_44.

This first-order theory is relevant as the structures discussed below are model thereof. However, this section thus does not concern aspects akin to topology and relevant arithmetic substructures are not definable therein.

As explained, various predicates will fail to be decidable in a constructive formulation, such as these formed from order-theoretical relations. This includes &quot;formula_38&quot;, which will be rendered equivalent to a negation. Crucial disjunctions are now discussed explicitly.

====Trichotomy====
In intuitonistic logic, the disjunctive syllogism in the form formula_46 generally really only goes in the formula_47-direction. In a pseudo-order, one has
:formula_48
and indeed at most one of the three can hold at once. But the stronger, &quot;logically positive&quot; law of trichotomy disjunction does not hold in general, i.e. it is not provable that for all reals,
:formula_49
See analytical formula_50. Other disjunctions are however implied based on other positivity results, e.g. formula_51. Likewise, the asymmetric order in the theory ought to fulfill the weak linearity property formula_52 for all formula_53, related to locatedness of the reals.

The theory shall validate further axioms concerning the relation between the positivity predicate formula_1 and the algebraic operations including multiplicative inversion, as well as the intermediate value theorem for polynomials. 
In this theory, between any two separated numbers, other numbers exist.

====Apartness====
In the context of analysis, the auxiliary logically positive predicate
:formula_55
may be independently defined and constitutes an &quot;apartness relation&quot;. With it, the substitute of the principles above give tightness
:formula_56
Thus, apartness can also function as a definition of &quot;formula_38&quot;, rendering it a negation. All negations are stable in intuitionistic logic, and therefore
:formula_58
The elusive trichotomy disjunction itself then reads
:formula_59
Importantly, a proof of the disjunction formula_60 carries positive information, in both senses of the word. Via formula_61 it also follows that formula_62. In words: A demonstration that a number is somehow apart from zero is also a demonstration that this number is non-zero. But constructively it does not follow that the doubly negative statement formula_63 would imply formula_64. Consequently, many classically equivalent statements bifurcate into distinct statement. For example, for a fixed polynomial formula_65 and fixed formula_66, the statement that the formula_67&#x27;th coefficient formula_68 of formula_69 is apart from zero is stronger than the mere statement that it is non-zero. A demonstration of former explicates how formula_68 and zero are related, with respect to the ordering predicate on the reals, while a demonstration of the latter shows how negation of such conditions would imply to a contradiction. In turn, there is then also a strong and a looser notion of, e.g., being a third-order polynomial.

So the excluded middle for formula_64 is apriori stronger than that for formula_2. However, see the discussion of possible further axiomatic principles regarding the strength of &quot;formula_38&quot; below.

====Non-strict partial order====
Lastly, the relation formula_74 may be defined by or proven equivalent to the logically negative statement formula_75, and then formula_76 is defined as formula_77. Decidability of positivity may thus be expressed as formula_78, which as noted will not be provable in general. But neither will the totality disjunction formula_79, see also analytical formula_80.

By a valid De Morgan&#x27;s law, the conjunction of such statements is also rendered a negation of apartness, and so
:formula_81
The disjunction formula_82 implies formula_83, but the other direction is also not provable in general. In a constructive real closed field, the relation &quot;formula_84&quot; is a negation and is not equivalent to the disjunction in general.

====Variations====
Demanding good order properties as above but strong completeness properties at the same time implies formula_6. Notably, the MacNeille completion has better completeness properties as a collection, but a more intricate theory of its order-relation and, in turn, worse locatedness properties. While less commonly employed, also this construction simplifies to the classical real numbers when assuming formula_6.

===Invertibility===
In the commutative ring of real numbers, a provably non-invertible element equals zero. This and the most basic locality structure is abstracted in the theory of Heyting fields.

==Formalization==
===Rational sequences===
A common approach is to identify the real numbers with non-volatile sequences in formula_16. The constant sequences correspond to rational numbers. Algebraic operations such as addition and multiplication can be defined component-wise, together with a systematic reindexing for speedup. The definition in terms of sequences furthermore enables the definition of a strict order &quot;formula_88&quot; fulfilling the desired axioms. Other relations discussed above may then be defined in terms of it. In particular, any number formula_89 apart from formula_19, i.e. formula_64, eventually has an index beyond which all its elements are invertible.
Various implications between the relations, as well as between sequences with various properties, may then be proven.

====Moduli====
As the maximum on a finite set of rationals is decidable, an absolute value map on the reals may be defined and Cauchy convergence and limits of sequences of reals can be defined as usual.

A modulus of convergence is often employed in the constructive study of Cauchy sequences of reals, meaning the association of any formula_92 to an appropriate index (beyond which the sequences are closer than formula_93) is required in the form of an explicit, strictly increasing function formula_94. Such a modulus may be considered for a sequence of reals, but it may also be considered for all the reals themselves, in which case one is really dealing with a sequence of pairs.

====Bounds and suprema====
Given such a model then enables the definition of more set theoretic notions. For any subset of reals, one may speak of an upper bound formula_95, negatively characterized using formula_96. One may speak of least upper bounds with respect to &quot;formula_97&quot;. A supremum is an upper bound given through a sequence of reals, positively characterized using &quot;formula_98&quot;. If a subset with an upper bound is well-behaved with respect to &quot;formula_98&quot; (discussed below), it has a supremum.

====Bishop&#x27;s formalization====
One formalization of constructive analysis, modeling the order properties described above, proves theorems for sequences of rationals formula_89 fulfilling the &quot;regularity&quot; condition formula_101. An alternative is using the tighter formula_102 instead of formula_103, and in the latter case non-zero indices ought to be used. No two of the rational entries in a regular sequence are more than formula_104 apart and so one may compute natural numbers exceeding any real. For the regular sequences, one defines the logically positive loose positivity property as formula_105, where the relation on the right hand side is in terms of rational numbers. Formally, a positive real in this language is a regular sequence together with a natural witnessing positivity. Further, formula_106, which is logically equivalent to the negation formula_107. This is provably transitive and in turn an equivalence relation. Via this predicate, the regular sequences in the band formula_108 are deemed equivalent to the zero sequence. Such definitions are of course compatible with classical investigations and variations thereof were well studied also before. One has formula_109 as formula_110. Also, formula_111 may be defined from a numerical non-negativity property, as formula_112 for all formula_113, but then shown to be equivalent of the logical negation of the former.

====Variations====
The above definition of formula_114 uses a common bound formula_115. Other formalizations directly take as definition that for any fixed bound formula_116, the numbers formula_89 and formula_118 must eventually be forever at least as close.
Exponentially falling bounds formula_102 are also used, also say in a real number condition formula_120, and likewise for the equality of two such reals. And also the sequences of rationals may be required to carry a modulus of convergence. Positivity properties may defined as being eventually forever apart by some rational.

Function choice in formula_3 or stronger principles aid such frameworks.

====Coding====
It is worth noting that sequences in formula_16 can be coded rather compactly, as they each may be mapped to a unique subclass of formula_123. A sequence rationals formula_124 may be encoded as set of quadruples formula_125. In turn, this can be encoded as unique naturals formula_126 using the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. There are more economic pairing functions as well, or extension encoding tags or metadata. For an example using this encoding, the sequence formula_127, or formula_128, may be used to compute Euler&#x27;s number and with the above coding it maps to the subclass formula_129 of formula_123. While this example, an explicit sequence of sums, is a total recursive function to begin with, the encoding also means these objects are in scope of the quantifiers in second-order arithmetic.

===Set theory===
====Cauchy reals====
In some frameworks of analysis, the name &quot;real numbers&quot; is given to such well-behaved sequences or rationals, and relations such as formula_114 are called the &quot;equality or real numbers&quot;. Note, however, that there are properties which can distinguish between two formula_38-related reals.

In contrast, in a set theory that models the naturals formula_123 and validates the existence of even classically uncountable function spaces (and certainly say formula_4 or even formula_135) the numbers equivalent with respect to &quot;formula_38&quot; in formula_16 may be collected into a set and then this is called the &quot;Cauchy real number&quot;. In that language, regular rational sequences are degraded to a mere representative of a Cauchy real. Equality of those reals is then given by the equality of sets, which is governed by the set theoretical axiom of extensionality. An upshot is that the set theory will prove properties for the reals, i.e. for this class of sets, expressed using the logical equality. Constructive reals in the presence of appropriate choice axioms will be Cauchy-complete but not automatically order-complete.

====Dedekind reals====
In this context it may also be possible to model a theory or real numbers in terms of Dedekind cuts of formula_138. At least when assuming formula_139 or dependent choice, these structures are isomorphic.

====Interval arithmetic====
Another approach is to define a real number as a certain subset of formula_140, holding pairs representing inhabited, pairwise intersecting intervals.

====Uncountability====
Recall that the preorder on cardinals &quot;formula_97&quot; in set theory is the primary notion defined as injection existence. As a result, the constructive theory of cardinal order can diverge substantially from the classical one. Here, sets like formula_16 or some models of the reals can be taken to be subcountable.

That said, Cantors diagonal construction proving uncountability of powersets like formula_143 and plain function spaces like formula_16 is intuitionistically valid. Assuming formula_6 or alternatively the countable choice axiom, models of formula_146 are always uncountable also over a constructive framework. One variant of the diagonal construction relevant for the present context may be formulated as follows, proven using countable choice and for reals as sequences of rationals:
:For any two pair of reals formula_147 and any sequence of reals formula_148, there exists a real formula_149 with formula_150 and formula_151.
Formulations of the reals aided by explicit moduli permit separate treatments.

According to Kanamori, &quot;a historical misrepresentation has been perpetuated that associates diagonalization with non-constructivity&quot; and a constructive component of the diagonal argument already appeared in Cantor&#x27;s work.

===Category and type theory===
All these considerations may also be undertaken in a topos or appropriate dependent type theory.

==Principles==
For practical mathematics, the axiom of dependent choice is adopted in various schools.

Markov&#x27;s principle is adopted in the Russian school of recursive mathematics. This principle strengthens the impact of proven negation of strict equality. A so-called analytical form of it grants formula_152 or formula_153. Weaker forms may be formulated.

The Brouwerian school reasons in terms of spreads and adopts the classically valid bar induction.

=== Anti-classical schools ===
Through the optional adoption of further consistent axioms, the negation of decidability may be provable. For example, equality-to-zero is rejected to be decidable when adopting Brouwerian continuity principles or Church&#x27;s thesis in recursive mathematics. The weak continuity principle as well as formula_154 even refute formula_155. The existence of a Specker sequence is proven from formula_154. Such phenomena also occur in realizability topoi. Notably, there are two anti-classical schools as incompatible with one-another. This article discusses principles compatible with the classical theory and choice is made explicit.

==Theorems==
Many classical theorems can only be proven in a formulation that is logically equivalent, over classical logic. Generally speaking, theorem formulation in constructive analysis mirrors the classical theory closest in separable spaces. Some theorems can only be formulated in terms of approximations.

===The intermediate value theorem===
For a simple example, consider the intermediate value theorem (IVT).
In classical analysis, IVT implies that, given any continuous function &quot;f&quot; from a closed interval [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;] to the real line &quot;R&quot;, if &quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) is negative while &quot;f&quot;(&quot;b&quot;) is positive, then there exists a real number &quot;c&quot; in the interval such that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;c&quot;) is exactly zero.
In constructive analysis, this does not hold, because the constructive interpretation of existential quantification (&quot;there exists&quot;) requires one to be able to &quot;construct&quot; the real number &quot;c&quot; (in the sense that it can be approximated to any desired precision by a rational number).
But if &quot;f&quot; hovers near zero during a stretch along its domain, then this cannot necessarily be done.

However, constructive analysis provides several alternative formulations of IVT, all of which are equivalent to the usual form in classical analysis, but not in constructive analysis.
For example, under the same conditions on &quot;f&quot; as in the classical theorem, given any natural number &quot;n&quot; (no matter how large), there exists (that is, we can construct) a real number &quot;c&quot;&quot;n&quot; in the interval such that the absolute value of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;c&quot;&quot;n&quot;) is less than 1/&quot;n&quot;.
That is, we can get as close to zero as we like, even if we can&#x27;t construct a &quot;c&quot; that gives us &quot;exactly&quot; zero.

Alternatively, we can keep the same conclusion as in the classical IVT—a single &quot;c&quot; such that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;c&quot;) is exactly zero—while strengthening the conditions on &quot;f&quot;.
We require that &quot;f&quot; be &quot;locally non-zero&quot;, meaning that given any point &quot;x&quot; in the interval [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;] and any natural number &quot;m&quot;, there exists (we can construct) a real number &quot;y&quot; in the interval such that |&quot;y&quot; - &quot;x&quot;| &lt; 1/&quot;m&quot; and |&quot;f&quot;(&quot;y&quot;)| &gt; 0.
In this case, the desired number &quot;c&quot; can be constructed.
This is a complicated condition, but there are several other conditions that imply it and that are commonly met; for example, every analytic function is locally non-zero (assuming that it already satisfies &quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) &lt; 0 and &quot;f&quot;(&quot;b&quot;) &gt; 0).

For another way to view this example, notice that according to classical logic, if the &quot;locally non-zero&quot; condition fails, then it must fail at some specific point &quot;x&quot;; and then &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) will equal 0, so that IVT is valid automatically.
Thus in classical analysis, which uses classical logic, in order to prove the full IVT, it is sufficient to prove the constructive version. From this perspective, the full IVT fails in constructive analysis simply because constructive analysis does not accept classical logic. Conversely, one may argue that the true meaning of IVT, even in classical mathematics, is the constructive version involving the &quot;locally non-zero&quot; condition, with the full IVT following by &quot;pure logic&quot; afterwards.
Some logicians, while accepting that classical mathematics is correct, still believe that the constructive approach gives a better insight into the true meaning of theorems, in much this way.

===The least-upper-bound principle and compact sets===
Another difference between classical and constructive analysis is that constructive analysis does not prove the least-upper-bound principle, i.e. that any subset of the real line R would have a least upper bound (or supremum), possibly infinite.
However, as with the intermediate value theorem, an alternative version survives; in constructive analysis, any &quot;located&quot; subset of the real line has a supremum.
(Here a subset &quot;S&quot; of R is &quot;located&quot; if, whenever &quot;x&quot; &lt; &quot;y&quot; are real numbers, either there exists an element &quot;s&quot; of &quot;S&quot; such that &quot;x&quot; &lt; &quot;s&quot;, or &quot;y&quot; is an upper bound of &quot;S&quot;.)
Again, this is classically equivalent to the full least upper bound principle, since every set is located in classical mathematics.
And again, while the definition of located set is complicated, nevertheless it is satisfied by many commonly studied sets, including all intervals and all compact sets.

Closely related to this, in constructive mathematics, fewer characterisations of compact spaces are constructively valid—or from another point of view, there are several different concepts that are classically equivalent but not constructively equivalent.
Indeed, if the interval [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;] were sequentially compact in constructive analysis, then the classical IVT would follow from the first constructive version in the example; one could find &quot;c&quot; as a cluster point of the infinite sequence (&quot;c&quot;&quot;n&quot;)&quot;n&quot;∈N.

<doc id="239855" wikidata="Q912243" url="?curid=239855" title="German alphabet">
<text>The modern German alphabet consists of the twenty-six letters of the ISO basic Latin alphabet:

German uses letter-diacritic combinations (Ä/ä, Ö/ö, Ü/ü) using the umlaut and one ligature (ẞ/ß (called &quot;eszett&quot; (sz) or &quot;scharfes S&quot;, sharp s)), but they do not constitute distinct letters in the alphabet. 

== Key characteristics ==
=== Umlaut diacritic usage ===
Although the diacritic letters represent distinct sounds in German phonology, they are almost universally not considered to be part of the alphabet. Almost all German speakers consider the alphabet to have the 26 cardinal letters above and will name only those when asked to say the alphabet.

The diacritic letters &quot;ä, ö&quot; and &quot;ü&quot; are used to indicate the presence of umlauts (frontalizations of back vowels). Before the introduction of the printing press, frontalization was indicated by placing an &quot;e&quot; after the back vowel to be modified, but German printers developed the space-saving typographical convention of replacing the full &quot;e&quot; with a small version placed above the vowel to be modified. In German Kurrent writing, the superscripted &quot;e&quot; was simplified to two vertical dashes, which have degenerated to dots in both handwriting and German typesetting. Although the two dots look like those in the diaeresis (trema) diacritical marking, a distinction should be made between umlaut and diaresis because the two have different functions.

When it is not possible to use the umlauts (for example, when using a restricted character set) the characters &quot;Ä, Ö, Ü, ä, ö, ü&quot; should be transcribed as &quot;Ae, Oe, Ue, ae, oe, ue&quot; respectively, following the earlier postvocalic-&quot;e&quot; convention; simply using the base vowel (e.g., &quot;u&quot; instead of &quot;ü&quot;) would be wrong and misleading. However, such transcription should be avoided if possible, especially with names. Names often exist in different variants, such as &quot;Müller&quot; and &quot;Mueller&quot;, and with such transcriptions in use one could not work out the correct spelling of the name.

Automatic back-transcribing is not only wrong for names. Consider, for example, &quot;das neue Buch&quot; (&quot;the new book&quot;). This should never be changed to &quot;das neü Buch&quot;, as the second &quot;e&quot; is completely separate from the &quot;u&quot;: &quot;neue&quot; is &quot;neu&quot; (the root for new) followed by an &quot;e&quot;, an inflection. The word &quot;neü&quot; does not exist in German.

Furthermore, in northern and western Germany, there are family names and place names in which &quot;e&quot; lengthens the preceding vowel, as in the former Dutch orthography, such as Straelen, which is pronounced with a long &quot;a&quot;, not an &quot;ä&quot;. Similar cases are Soest, Coesfeld and Bernkastel-Kues.

In proper names and ethnonyms, there may also appear a rare &quot;ë&quot; and &quot;ï&quot;, which are not letters with an umlaut, but a diaeresis, used as in French to distinguish what could be a digraph, for example, &quot;ai&quot; in Karaïmen, &quot;eu&quot; in Alëuten, &quot;ie&quot; in Ferdinand Piëch and &quot;oe&quot; in Bernhard Hoëcker (although Hoëcker added the diaeresis personally). To separate the &quot;au&quot; diphthong, as well as some others, which are graphically composed of potentially umlaut-holding letters, the acute accent is sometimes used (e.g. Saúdi-Arabien). 

Swiss typewriters and computer keyboards do not allow easy input of uppercase letters with umlauts (nor &quot;ß&quot;) for their positions are taken by the most frequent French diacritics. Uppercase umlauts were dropped because they are less common than lowercase ones (especially in Switzerland). Geographical names in particular are supposed to be written with &quot;A, O, U&quot; plus &quot;e&quot; except &quot;Österreich&quot; (Austria). The omission can cause some inconvenience since the first letter of every noun is capitalized in German.

Unlike in Hungarian, the exact shape of the umlaut diacritics, especially when handwritten, is not important, because they are the only ones in the language (except for the dot on &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot;). They will be understood whether they look like dots (¨), acute accents (̋), vertical bars (̎), a horizontal bar (macron, ¯), a breve (˘), a tiny N, a tilde (˜), and such variations are often used in stylized writing (e.g. logos). In the past, however, the breve was traditionally used in some scripts to distinguish a &quot;u&quot; from an &quot;n&quot;, as was the ring (°). In rare cases the &quot;n&quot; was underlined. The breved &quot;u&quot; was common in some Kurrent-derived handwritings; it was mandatory in Sütterlin.

===Sharp s===

The &quot;eszett&quot; or &quot;scharfes S&quot; (ß) represents the unvoiced s sound. The German spelling reform of 1996 somewhat reduced usage of this letter in Germany and Austria. It is not used in Switzerland and Liechtenstein.

As the ß derives from a ligature of lower-case letters, it is itself exclusively lower-case. The proper transcription when it cannot be used, or when writing a word in all capital letters, is &quot;ss&quot; or &quot;SS&quot;. This transcription can give rise to ambiguities, albeit rarely; one such case is &quot;in Maßen&quot; (in moderation) vs. &quot;in Massen&quot; (en masse). For all caps usage, an uppercase &quot;ß&quot; has been proposed for over a century, but has found neither general acceptance nor official recognition. In 2008, however, it was included in Unicode 5.1 as U+1E9E, and since 2010 its use is mandatory in official documentation when writing geographical names in all-caps.

Although nowadays substituted correctly only by &quot;ss&quot;, the letter actually originates from two distinct ligatures (depending on word and spelling rules): &quot;long s&quot; with &quot;round s&quot; (&quot;ſs&quot;) and &quot;long s&quot; with &quot;(round) z&quot; (&quot;ſz&quot;/&quot;ſʒ&quot;). Some people therefore prefer to substitute &quot;ß&quot; by &quot;sz&quot;. According to official rules this is incorrect, but it can avoid possible ambiguities (as in the above &quot;Maßen&quot; vs &quot;Massen&quot; example).

Incorrect use of the &quot;ß&quot; letter is a very common type of spelling error even among native German speakers. Although the spelling reform of 1996 was meant to simplify the rules concerning &quot;ß&quot; and &quot;ss&quot;, it also caused considerable confusion and is widely disregarded: some people even incorrectly assumed that the &quot;ß&quot; had been abolished completely.

=== Long s ===
In the Fraktur typeface and similar scripts, a long s (ſ) was used except in syllable endings (cf. Greek sigma) and sometimes it was historically used in antiqua fonts as well; but it went out of general use in the early 1940s along with the Fraktur typeface. An example where this convention would avoid ambiguity is &quot;Wachstube&quot;, which was written either &quot;Wachſtube&quot; = &quot;Wach-Stube&quot; (, guardhouse) or &quot;Wachstube&quot; = &quot;Wachs-Tube&quot; (, tube of wax).

=== Letter usage in loanwords ===
* Except for the common sequences &quot;sch&quot; (), &quot;ch&quot; (allophone: or ) and &quot;ck&quot; () the letter &quot;c&quot; appears only in loanwords or in proper nouns. In many loanwords, including most words of Latin origin, the letter &quot;c&quot; pronounced () has been replaced by &quot;k&quot;. German words which come from Latin words with &quot;c&quot; before &quot;e, i, y, ae, oe&quot; are usually pronounced with () and spelled with &quot;z&quot;.
* The letter &quot;q&quot; in German only ever appears in the sequence &quot;qu&quot; (), with the exception of loanwords, e.g., &quot;Coq au vin&quot; or &quot;Qigong&quot; (which is also written &quot;Chigong&quot;).
* The letter &quot;x&quot; (&quot;Ix&quot;, ) occurs almost exclusively in loanwords. Native German words that are now pronounced with a sound are usually written using &quot;chs&quot; or &quot;cks&quot;, as with &quot;Fuchs&quot; (fox). Some exceptions do occur, though, such as &quot;Hexe&quot; (witch), &quot;Nixe&quot; (mermaid) and &quot;Axt&quot; (axe).
* The letter &quot;y&quot; (&quot;Ypsilon&quot;, ) occurs almost exclusively in loanwords, especially words of Greek origin, although some such words (e.g., &quot;Typ&quot;) have become so common that they are no longer perceived as foreign. It used to be more common in German orthography in earlier centuries, and traces of this earlier usage persist in proper names. It is used either as an alternative letter for i, for instance in &quot;Mayer&quot; / &quot;Meyer&quot; (a common family name that occurs also in the spellings &quot;Maier&quot; / &quot;Meier&quot;), or – especially in the Southwest – as a representation of that goes back to an old IJ (digraph), for instance in &quot;Schwyz&quot; or &quot;Schnyder&quot; (an Alemannic German variant of the name &quot;Schneider&quot;). Another notable exception is &quot;Bayern&quot;, the German name of Bavaria, and derived words like &quot;bayerisch&quot; (Bavarian).

In loan words from the French language spelling and accents are usually preserved. For instance, &quot;café&quot; is always written &quot;Café&quot; in German when it means &quot;coffeehouse&quot;; &quot;Cafe&quot; would be considered erroneous and it cannot be written &quot;Kaffee&quot; either, because this means &quot;coffee&quot;. For this reason German typewriters and computer keyboards offer two dead keys, one for the acute and grave accents, and one for circumflex. Other letters occur less often, like &quot;ç&quot; in loan words from French or Portuguese, and &quot;ñ&quot; in loan words from Spanish.

=== Sorting ===
There are three ways to deal with the umlauts in alphabetic sorting.
# Treat them like their base characters, as if the umlaut was not present (DIN 5007-1, section 6.1.1.4.1). This is the preferred method for dictionaries, where umlauted words (&quot;Füße&quot;, feet) should appear near their origin words (&quot;Fuß&quot;, foot). In words which are the same except for one having an umlaut and one its base character (e.g., &quot;Müll&quot; vs. &quot;Mull&quot;), the word with the base character gets precedence.
# Decompose them (invisibly) to vowel plus &quot;e&quot; (DIN 5007-2, section 6.1.1.4.2). This is often preferred for personal and geographical names, wherein the characters are used unsystematically, as in German telephone directories (&quot;Müller, A.; Mueller, B.; Müller, C.&quot;).
# They are treated like extra letters either placed
## after their base letters (Austrian phone books have &quot;ä&quot; between &quot;az&quot; and &quot;b&quot; etc.) or
## at the end of the alphabet (as in Swedish or in extended ASCII).
Microsoft Windows in German versions offers the choice between the first two variants in its internationalisation settings.

&quot;Eszett&quot; is sorted as though it were &quot;ss&quot;. Occasionally it is treated as &quot;s&quot;, but this is generally considered incorrect. It is not used at all in Switzerland.

Accents in French loan words are always ignored in collation.

In rare contexts (e. g. in older indices) &quot;sch&quot; (equal to English &quot;sh&quot;) and likewise &quot;st&quot; and &quot;ch&quot; are treated as single letters, but the vocalic digraphs &quot;ai, ei&quot; (historically &quot;ay, ey&quot;), &quot;au, äu, eu&quot; and the historic &quot;ui&quot; and &quot;oi&quot; never are.

== Spelling alphabet ==
There is a German spelling alphabet similar to the ICAO spelling alphabet. The official version in Germany, laid down in DIN 5009, is as follows:

The spelling alphabet was changed several times during the 20th century, in some cases for political reasons. In 1934, &quot;Jewish&quot; names (i.e. those derived from the Hebrew Bible) were replaced by the Nazi regime. Thus, &quot;David, Jakob, Nathan, Samuel&quot; and &quot;Zacharias&quot; became &quot;Dora, Jot, Nordpol, Siegfried&quot; and &quot;Zeppelin&quot;. In Germany, the 1948 and 1950 versions reverted to some of the old versions but introduced additional changes. Many of the older, officially obsolete forms are still found in popular use, in particular &quot;Siegfried&quot; and &quot;Zeppelin&quot;. Some letter names are still official in Austria. The official Austrian version, as laid down in ÖNORM A 1081, differs from DIN 5009 in the following places:

&quot;Konrad&quot; is also used in Germany, although this is not and never was official there. &quot;Konrad&quot; can cause confusion since the first name &quot;Conrad&quot; (spelled with a &quot;C&quot;) also exists. Not following the norm, but not uncommon are &quot;CHarlotte&quot; and - especially in Austria - &quot;CHristine&quot;, &quot;Norbert&quot; and &quot;Zeppelin&quot;.

In Switzerland and Liechtenstein yet another slightly different spelling alphabet is used.

<text>The macaques () constitute a genus (Macaca) of gregarious Old World monkeys of the subfamily Cercopithecinae. The 23 species of macaques inhabit ranges throughout Asia, North Africa, and Europe (in Gibraltar). Macaques are principally frugivorous (preferring fruit), although their diet also includes seeds, leaves, flowers, and tree bark. Some species such as the long-tailed macaque (&quot;M. fascicularis&quot;; also called the crab-eating macaque) will supplement their diets with small amounts of meat from shellfish, insects, and small mammals. On average, a southern pig-tailed macaque (&quot;M. nemestrina&quot;) in Malaysia eats about 70 large rats each year. All macaque social groups are arranged around dominant matriarchs.

Macaques are found in a variety of habitats throughout the Asian continent and are highly adaptable. Certain species are synanthropic, having learned to live alongside humans, but they have become problematic in urban areas in Southeast Asia and are not suitable to live with, as they can carry transmittable diseases. 

Most macaque species are listed as vulnerable to critically endangered on the International Union of the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List.

==Description==
Aside from humans (genus &quot;Homo&quot;), the macaques are the most widespread primate genus, ranging from Japan to the Indian subcontinent, and in the case of the Barbary macaque (&quot;Macaca sylvanus&quot;), to North Africa and Southern Europe. Twenty-three macaque species are currently recognized. Macaques are robust primates whose arms and legs are about the same in length. The fur of these animals is typically varying shades of brown or black and their muzzles are rounded in profile with nostrils on the upper surface. The tail varies among each species, which can be long, moderate, short or totally absent. &quot; &quot;Although several species lack tails, and their common names refer to them as apes, these are true monkeys, with no greater relationship to the true apes than any other Old World monkeys. Instead, this comes from an earlier definition of &#x27;ape&#x27; that included primates generally.

In some species, skin folds join the second through fifth toes, almost reaching the first metatarsal joint. The monkey&#x27;s size differs depending on sex and species. Males from all species can range from 41 to 70 cm (16 to 28 inches) in head and body length, and in weight from 5.5 to 18 kg (12.13 to 39.7 lb). Females can range from a weight of 2.4 to 13 kg (5.3 to 28.7 lb). These primates live in troops that vary in size, where males dominate, however the order of dominance frequently shifts. Female dominance lasts longer and depends upon their genealogical position. Macaques are able to swim and spend most of their time on the ground and spend some time in trees. They have large pouches in their cheeks where they carry extra food. They are considered highly intelligent and are often used in the medical field for experimentation due to their remarkable similarity to humans in emotional and cognitive development. Extensive experimentation has led to the long-tailed macaque being listed as endangered.

==Distribution and habitat==
Macaques are highly adaptable to different habitats and climates and can tolerate a wide fluctuation of temperatures and live in varying landscape settings. They easily adapt to human-built environments and can survive well in urban settings if they are able to obtain food. They can also survive in completely natural settings absent of humans.

The ecological and geographic ranges of the macaque are the widest of any non-human primate. Their habitats include the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, Sri Lanka, India, arid mountains of Pakistan and Afghanistan, and temperate mountains in Algeria, Japan, China, Morocco, and Nepal. Some species also inhabit villages and towns in cities in Asia. There is also an introduced population of rhesus macaques in the US state of Florida consisting, essentially, of monkeys abandoned when a failed boat ride-safari was shut down in the mid-20th century.

A probable Early Pliocene macaque molar from the Red Crag Formation (Waldringfield, United Kingdom), represents one of the oldest and northernmost records of the genus in Europe reported to date.

==Ecology and behavior==
===Diet===
Macaques are mainly frugivorous, although some species have been observed feeding on insects. In natural habitats, they have been observed to consume certain parts of over one hundred species of plants including the buds, fruit, young leaves, bark, roots, and flowers. When macaques live amongst people, they raid agricultural crops such as wheat, rice, or sugarcane; and garden crops like tomatoes, bananas, melons, mangos, or papayas. In human settings, they also rely heavily on direct handouts from people. This includes peanuts, rice, legumes, or even prepared food.

===Group structure===
Macaques live in established social groups that can range from a few individuals to several hundred, as they are social animals. A typical social group possess between 20 and 50 individuals of all ages and of both sexes. The typical composition consists of 15% adult males, 35% adult females, 20% infants, and 30% juveniles, though there exists variation in structure and size of groups across populations.

Macaques have a very intricate social structure and hierarchy, with different classifications of despotism depending on species. If a macaque of a lower level in the social chain has eaten berries and none are left for a higher-ranking macaque, then the one higher in status can, within this social organization, remove the berries from the other monkey&#x27;s mouth.

===Reproduction and mortality===
The reproductive potential of each species differs. Populations of the rhesus macaque can grow at rates of 10% to 15% per year if the environmental conditions are favorable. However, some forest-dwelling species are endangered with much lower reproductive rates. After one year of age, macaques move from being dependent on their mother during infancy, to the juvenile stage, where they begin to associate more with other juveniles through rough tumble and playing activities. They sexually mature between three and five years of age. Females will usually stay with the social group in which they were born; however, young adult males tend to disperse and attempt to enter other social groups. Not all males succeed in joining other groups and may become solitary, attempting to join other social groups for many years. Macaques have a typical lifespan of 20 to 30 years.

===As invasive species===
Certain species under the genus &quot;Macaca&quot; have become invasive in certain parts of the world, while others that survive in forest habitats remain threatened. The long-tailed macaque (&quot;M. fascicularis&quot;) is listed as a threat and invasive alien species in Mauritius, along with the rhesus macaques (&quot;M. mulatta&quot;) in Florida. Despite this, the former is listed as endangered.

The long-tailed macaque causes severe damage to parts of its range where it has been introduced because the populations grow unchecked due to a lack of predators. On the island of Mauritius, they have created serious conservation concerns for other endemic species. They consume seeds of native plants and aid in the spread of exotic weeds throughout the forests. This changes the composition of the habitats and allows them to be rapidly overrun by invasive plants. 

Long-tailed macaques are also responsible for the near extinction of several bird species on Mauritius by destroying the nests of the birds as they move through their native ranges and eat the eggs of critically endangered species, such as the pink pigeon and Mauritian green parrot. They can be serious agricultural pests because they raid crops and gardens and humans often shoot the monkeys which can eliminate entire local populations.

In Florida, a group of rhesus macaques inhabit Silver Springs State Park. Humans often feed them, which may alter their movement and keep them close to the river on weekends where high human traffic is present. The monkeys can become aggressive toward humans (largely due to human ignorance of macaque behavior), and also carry potentially fatal human diseases, including the herpes B virus.

==Relations with humans==
Several species of macaque are used extensively in animal testing, particularly in the neuroscience of visual perception and the visual system.

Nearly all (73–100%) captive rhesus macaques are carriers of the herpes B virus. This virus is harmless to macaques, but infections of humans, while rare, are potentially fatal, a risk that makes macaques unsuitable as pets.

Urban performing macaques also carried simian foamy virus, suggesting they could be involved in the species-to-species jump of similar retroviruses to humans.

===Population control===
Management techniques have historically been controversial, and public disapproval can hinder control efforts. Previously, efforts to remove macaque individuals were met with public resistance. One management strategy that is currently being explored is that of sterilization. Natural resource managers are being educated by scientific studies in the proposed strategy. Effectiveness of this strategy is estimated to succeed in keeping populations in check. For example, if 80% of females are sterilized every five years, or 50% every two years, it could effectively reduce the population. Other control strategies include planting specific trees to provide protection to native birds from macaque predation, live trapping, and the vaccine porcine zona pellucida (PZP), which causes infertility in females.

===Cloning===
In January 2018, scientists in China reported in the journal &quot;Cell&quot; the first creation of two crab-eating macaque clones, named Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua, using somatic cell nuclear transfer – the same method that produced Dolly the sheep.

<text>Distribution is the process of making a product or service available for the consumer or business user who needs it, and a distributor is a business involved in the distribution stage of the value chain. Distribution can be done directly by the producer or service provider or by using indirect channels with distributors or intermediaries. Distribution (or place) is one of the four elements of the marketing mix: the other three elements being product, pricing, and promotion.

Decisions about distribution need to be taken in line with a company&#x27;s overall strategic vision and mission. Developing a coherent distribution plan is a central component of strategic planning. At the strategic level, as well as deciding whether to distribute directly or via a distribution network, there are three broad approaches to distribution, namely mass, selective and exclusive distribution. The number and type of intermediaries selected largely depends on the strategic approach. The overall distribution channel should add value to the consumer.

==Definition==
Distribution is fundamentally concerned with ensuring that products reach target customers in the most direct and cost-efficient manner. In the case of services, distribution is principally concerned with access. Although distribution, as a concept, is relatively simple, in practice distribution management may involve a diverse range of activities and disciplines including detailed logistics, transportation, warehousing, storage, inventory management as well as channel management, including selection of channel members and rewarding distributors.

==Strategies==
Before designing a distribution system, the supplier needs to determine what distribution channel to achieve in broad terms. The approach to distributing products or services depends on a number of factors including the type of product, especially perishability; the market served; the geographic scope of operations and the firm&#x27;s overall mission and vision. The process of setting out a broad statement of the aims and objectives of a distribution channel is a strategic level decision.

Strategically, there are three approaches to distribution:

* &quot;Mass distribution&quot; (also known as &quot;an&quot; &quot;intensive distribution&quot;): When products are destined for a mass market, the marketer will seek out intermediaries that appeal to a broad market base. For example, snack foods and drinks are sold via a wide variety of outlets including supermarkets, convenience stores, vending machines, cafeterias and others. The choice of distribution outlet is skewed toward those that can deliver to mass markets in a cost efficient manner.
* &quot;Selective distribution:&quot; A manufacturer may choose to restrict the number of outlets handling a product. For example, a manufacturer of premium electrical goods may choose to deal with department stores and independent outlets that can provide added value service level required to support the product. Dr. Scholl&#x27;s orthopedic sandals, for example, only sell their product through pharmacies because this type of intermediary supports the desired &quot;therapeutic&quot; positioning of the product. Some of the prestige brands of cosmetics and skincare, such as Estee Lauder, Jurlique and Clinique, insist that sales staff are trained to use the product range. The manufacturer will only allow trained clinicians to sell their products.
* &quot;Exclusive distribution:&quot; In an exclusive distribution approach, a manufacturer chooses to deal with one intermediary or one type of intermediary. The advantage of an exclusive approach is that the manufacturer retains greater control over the distribution process. In exclusive arrangements, the distributor is expected to work closely with the manufacturer and add value to the product through service level, after sales care or client support services. Another definition of exclusive arrangement is an agreement between a supplier and a retailer granting the retailer exclusive rights within a specific geographic area to carry the supplier&#x27;s product.

Summary of strategic approaches to distribution
===Push vs pull ===
In consumer markets, another key strategic level decision is whether to use a push or pull strategy. In a &quot;push strategy&quot;, the marketer uses intensive advertising and incentives aimed at distributors, especially retailers and wholesalers, with the expectation that they will stock the product or brand, and that consumers will purchase it when they see it in stores. In contrast, in a &quot;pull strategy&quot;, the marketer promotes the product directly to consumers hoping that they will pressure retailers to stock the product or brand, thereby pulling it through the distribution channel. The choice of a push or pull strategy has important implications for advertising and promotion. In a push strategy, the promotional mix would consist of trade advertising and sales calls while the advertising media would normally be weighted toward trade magazines, exhibitions, and trade shows while a pull strategy would make more extensive use of consumer advertising and sales promotions while the media mix would be weighted toward mass-market media such as newspapers, magazines, television, and radio.

==Channels and intermediaries==

Distribution of products takes place through a marketing channel, also known as a distribution channel. A marketing channel is the people, organizations, and activities necessary to transfer the ownership of goods from the point of production to the point of consumption. It is the way products get to the end-user, the consumer. This is mostly accomplished through merchant retailers or wholesalers or, in the international context, by importers. In certain specialist markets, agents or brokers may become involved in the marketing channel: for example in the insurance sector, the European Union has noted that &quot;insurance and reinsurance intermediaries play a central role in the distribution of insurance and reinsurance products&quot; . The EU introduced the Insurance Distribution Directive in 2016 to enhance a level of harmonisation in this market across EU member states.

Typical intermediaries involved in distribution include:

* Wholesaler: A merchant intermediary who sells chiefly to retailers, other merchants, or industrial, institutional, and commercial users mainly for resale or business use. The transactions are B2B (Business to Business). Wholesalers typically sell in large quantities. (Wholesalers, by definition, do not deal directly with the public).
* Retailer: A merchant intermediary who sells direct to the public. There are many different types of retail outlet - from hypermarts and supermarkets to small, independent stores. The transactions in this case are B2C (Business to Customer).
* Agent: An intermediary who is authorized to act for a principal in order to facilitate exchange. Unlike merchant wholesalers and retailers, agents do not take title to goods, but simply put buyers and sellers together. Agents are typically paid via commissions by the principal. For example, travel agents are paid a commission of around 15% for each booking made with an airline or hotel operator.
* Jobber: A special type of wholesaler, typically one who operates on a small scale and sells only to retailers or institutions. For example, rack jobbers are small independent wholesalers who operate from a truck, supplying convenience stores with snack foods and drinks on a regular basis.

==Channel design==

A firm can design any number of channels they require to reach customers efficiently and effectively. Channels can be distinguished by the number of intermediaries between producer and consumer. If there are no intermediaries then this is known as a &quot;zero-level&quot; distribution system or direct marketing. A &quot;level one&quot; (sometimes called &quot;one-tier&quot;) channel has a single intermediary. A &quot;level two&quot; (alternatively a &quot;two-tier&quot;) channel has two intermediaries, and so on. This flow is typically represented as being manufacturer to retailer to consumer, but may involve other types of intermediaries. In practice, distribution systems for perishable goods tend to be shorter - direct or single intermediary, because of the need to reduce the time a product spends in transit or in storage. In other cases, distribution systems can become quite complex involving many levels and different types of intermediaries.

==Channel mix==
In practice, many organizations use a mix of different channels; a direct sales force may call on larger customers. This may be complemented with other agents to cover smaller customers and prospects. When a single organization uses a variety of different channels to reach its markets, this is known as a &quot;multi-channel&quot; distribution network. In addition, online retailing or e-commerce is leading to disintermediation, the removal of intermediaries from a supply chain. Retailing via smartphone or m-commerce is also a growth area.

==Channel management==
The firm&#x27;s marketing department needs to design the most suitable channels for the firm&#x27;s products, then select appropriate channel members or intermediaries. An organization may need to train staff of intermediaries and motivate the intermediary to sell the firm&#x27;s products. The firm should monitor the channel&#x27;s performance over time and modify the channel to enhance performance.

===Motivation===

To motivate intermediaries the firm can use positive actions, such as offering higher margins to the intermediary, special deals, premiums and allowances for advertising or display. On the other hand, negative actions may be necessary, such as threatening to cut back on margin, or hold back delivery of product. Care must be exercised when considering negative actions as these may fall foul of regulations and can contribute to a public backlash and a public relations disaster. Manufacturer complacency has been highlighted as a risk leading distributors to move their business to other supply lines.

===Conflict===
Channel conflict can arise when one intermediary&#x27;s actions prevent another intermediary from achieving their objectives. Vertical channel conflict occurs between the levels within a channel, and horizontal channel conflict occurs between intermediaries at the same level within a channel. Channel conflict is a perennial problem. There are risks that a powerful channel member may coordinate the interests of the channel for personal gain. Territories are often seen as a source of conflict, sometimes because boundaries are only loosely defined.

==Trends==
===Distributor development===
American building materials supplier Johns Manville noted in the years before the US entered World War II that distributors needed support in a range of practical areas if they were going to be successful in connecting with housing developers, and instituted &quot;Housing Guilds&quot; which brought together the distributor (as the materials supplier), design services, sub-contractors, local realtors and housing financiers. Laurence C. Hart refers to the extensive development of these guilds and the &quot;Training Schools&quot; which they operated, converting these into a radio-based program from 1942. Hart, who worked for the supplier, put this experience forward to the American Marketing Association as &quot;an outstanding example of manufacturer-distributor collaboration on an industry-wide basis&quot;.

Companies wishing to grow through sales to new markets may need to identify and develop relationships with local distributors, for example to support export to new markets. In southeast Asia, for example, many distributors have a head office in Singapore which can be used by manufacturers outside the region to increase their regional market penetration and grow sales.

===Channel switching===

Channel-switching (not to be confused with zapping or channel surfing on TV) is the action of consumers switching from one type of channel intermediary to a different type of intermediary for their purchases. Examples include switching from brick-and-mortar stores to online catalogues and e-commerce providers; switching from grocery stores to convenience stores or switching from top tier department stores to mass market discount outlets. A number of factors have led to an increase in channel switching behaviour; the growth of e-commerce, the globalization of markets, the advent of category killers (such as Officeworks and Kids &#x27;R Us) as well as changes in the legal or statutory environment. For instance, in Australia and New Zealand, following a relaxation of laws prohibiting supermarkets from selling therapeutic goods, consumers have gradually switched away from pharmacies and toward supermarkets for the purchase of minor analgesics, cough and cold preparations and complementary medicines such as vitamins and herbal remedies.

For the consumer, channel switching offers a more diverse shopping experience, which may concern some sellers by its potential to erode market share. Evidence of channel switching can suggest that disruptive forces are at play, and that consumer behaviour is undergoing fundamental changes. A consumer may be prompted to switch channels when the product or service can be found at cheaper prices, when superior models become available, when a wider range is offered, or simply because it is more convenient to shop through a different channel (e.g. online or one-stop shopping). As a hedge against market share losses due to switching behaviour, some retailers engage in multi-channel retailing.

===Customer value===
The emergence of a service-dominant logic perspective has focused scholarly attention on how distribution networks serve to create customer value and to consider how value is co-created by all the players within the distribution chain, including the value created by customers themselves. This emphasis on value-creation is contributing to a change in terminology surrounding distribution processes; &quot;distribution networks&quot; are often termed &quot;value-chains&quot; while &quot;distribution centers&quot; are often termed &quot;customer fulfillment centers&quot;. For example, the retail giant Amazon, which utilizes both direct online distribution alongside bricks and mortar stores, now calls its distribution centers &quot;customer fulfillment centers&quot;. Although the term &quot;customer fulfillment center&quot; has been criticized on the grounds that it is a neologism, its use is becoming increasingly mainstream as it slowly makes its way into introductory marketing textbooks.

===Disintermediation===
Disintermediation occurs when manufacturers or service providers eliminate intermediaries from the distribution network and deal directly with purchasers. Disintermediation is found in industries where radically new types of channel intermediaries displace traditional distributors. The widespread public acceptance of online shopping has been a major trigger for disintermediation in some industries. Certain types of traditional intermediaries are dropping by the wayside.

<text>Wilhelm Friederich Hertenstein (5 May 1825, in Kyburg – 27 November 1888) was a Swiss politician.

Hertenstein was trained to manage forestries, and in 1847 he received the diploma of the Saxonian forest schools. From 1855 until 1872, he led the Canton of Zurich&#x27;s forestry department which was located in Fehraltorf. During most these years, he was a politician in the state&#x27;s legislative body. In the Swiss military, he served as an artillery officer, with a deployment during the Sonderbund war of 1847, and in 1872, he was made a colonel and also elected to the government of the Canton of Zurich. After a short stint in the Swiss Council of States beginning in 1878, Hertenstein was elected to the Swiss Federal Council on 21 March 1879 and died in office on 27 November 1888 following an emergency amputation of his leg. He was affiliated to the Free Democratic Party of Switzerland. During his office time he held the Military Department and was President of the Confederation in 1888. His funeral was a show of Swiss national unity.

Hertenstein died while in office as President of the Confederation and is so far the only holder of this office who did not finish his term.

<text>The University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) is a state-related research university in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. The university is composed of seventeen undergraduate and graduate schools and colleges at its urban Pittsburgh campus, home to the university&#x27;s central administration and around 28,000 undergraduate and graduate students. The 132-acre Pittsburgh campus includes various historic buildings that are part of the Schenley Farms Historic District, most notably its 42-story Gothic revival centerpiece, the Cathedral of Learning. Pitt is a member of the Association of American Universities and is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;. It is the second-largest non-government employer in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.

Pitt traces its roots to the Pittsburgh Academy founded by Hugh Henry Brackenridge in 1787. While the city was still on the edge of the American frontier at the time, Pittsburgh&#x27;s rapid growth meant that a proper university was soon needed, and Pitt&#x27;s charter was altered in 1819 to confer university status on it as the Western University of Pennsylvania. After surviving two devastating fires and several relocations, the university moved to its current location in Pittsburgh&#x27;s Oakland neighborhood, and by act of the state legislature was renamed the University of Pittsburgh in 1908. Pitt was a private institution until 1966, when it became part of the Commonwealth System of Higher Education.

The campus is situated adjacent to the flagship medical facilities of its closely affiliated University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) and its flagship hospital, UPMC Presbyterian, as well as the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, Schenley Park, and Carnegie Mellon University. The university also operates four undergraduate branch campuses in Western Pennsylvania, located in Bradford, Greensburg, Johnstown, and Titusville. In athletics, Pitt competes in Division I of the NCAA as the Pittsburgh Panthers, primarily as members of the Atlantic Coast Conference.

==History==

===Founding===
Founded by Hugh Henry Brackenridge as Pittsburgh Academy in 1787, the University of Pittsburgh is one of the few universities and colleges established in the 18th century in the United States. It is the oldest continuously chartered institution of learning in the U.S. west of the Allegheny Mountains. The school began as a preparatory school, presumably in a log cabin, possibly as early as 1770 in Western Pennsylvania, then a frontier. Brackenridge obtained a charter for the school from the state legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on February 28, 1787, just ten weeks before the opening of the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia. A brick building was erected in 1790 on the south side of Third Street and Cherry Alley for the Pittsburgh Academy. The small two-story brick building, with a gable facing the alley, contained three rooms: one below and two above.

===Western University of Pennsylvania===

Within a short period, more advanced education in the area was needed, so in 1819 the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania amended the school&#x27;s 1787 charter to confer university status. The school was named the Western University of Pennsylvania, or WUP, and was intended to be the western sister institution to the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. By 1830, WUP had moved into a new three-story, freestone-fronted building, with Ionic columns and a cupola, near its original buildings fronting the south side of Third Street, between Smithfield Street and Cherry Alley in downtown Pittsburgh. By the 1830s, the university faced severe financial pressure to abandon its traditional liberal education in favor of the state legislature&#x27;s desire for it to provide more vocational training. The decision to remain committed to liberal education nearly killed the university, but it persevered despite its abandonment by the city and state. It was also during this era that the founder of Mellon Bank, Thomas Mellon (Class of 1837), graduated and later taught at WUP.

The university&#x27;s buildings, along with most of its records and files, were destroyed in the Great Fire of 1845 that wiped out 20 square blocks of Pittsburgh. Classes were temporarily held in Trinity Church until a new building was constructed on Duquesne Way (on what was the site of the former Horne&#x27;s department store). Only four years later, in 1849, this building also was destroyed by fire. Due to the catastrophic nature of these fires, operations were suspended for a few years to allow the university time to regroup and rebuild. By 1854, WUP had erected a new building on the corner of Ross and Diamond (now Forbes Avenue) streets (site of the present day City-County building) and classes resumed in 1855. It is during this era, in 1867, that Samuel Pierpont Langley, astronomer, inventor, aviation pioneer and future Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, was chosen as director of the Allegheny Observatory that was donated to WUP in 1865. Langley was professor of astronomy and physics and remained at WUP until 1891, when he was succeeded by another prominent astronomer, James Keeler. Growing quickly during this period, WUP outgrew its downtown facilities and the university moved its campus to Allegheny City (present-day North Side).

The university eventually found itself on a site on the North Side&#x27;s Observatory Hill at the location of its Allegheny Observatory. There, it constructed two new buildings, Science Hall and Main Hall, that were occupied by 1889 and 1890 respectively. During this era, the first collegiate football team was formed at Pitt in 1889. In 1892, the Western Pennsylvania Medical College was amalgamated into the university (now the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine). By 1893, the university had graduated its first African-American, William Hunter Dammond. In 1895 WUP established its School of Law, and Andrew Carnegie and George Westinghouse were elected to the board of trustees, where they joined Andrew Mellon, who had been elected in 1894. The Pittsburgh College of Pharmacy and Pittsburgh Dental School also joined the university in 1896. In 1898, the first women, sisters Margaret and Stella Stein, graduated from the university. During this period, university engineering professor Reginald Fessenden was conducting pioneering work in radio broadcasting. By 1904, playing at Exposition Park, the university had its first undefeated football team.

===A new name and home===

Citing a need to avoid confusion, distinguish itself from the University of Pennsylvania, and return to its roots by identifying itself with the city, the Western University of Pennsylvania, by act of the state legislature, was renamed the University of Pittsburgh in the summer of 1908. During this time, the university had also outgrown its accommodations on what is now the North Side of Pittsburgh and its departments had been scattered throughout the city for years. To consolidate all of its components on one campus, WUP bought of land in December 1907 in what is now the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh and began relocating departments there by 1909. The initial campus plan for the new location centered on the winning submission from a national architectural contest that incorporated a Greek Acropolis design by Henry Hornbostel for 30 buildings. However, due to financial and other constraints, only four of the buildings were constructed in this style, of which only Thaw Hall remains today. In the fall of 1909, the university became the first college to adopt the panther as its mascot. It was also during this period that the university, led by Chancellor Samuel McCormick, again held off pressures to abandon the school&#x27;s commitment to liberal education in favor of more technical-based training. During his administration, McCormick also led the university into a new level of national recognition, expansion, and growth, as well as beginning institutional support of athletics.

In the 1920s, new university chancellor John Gabbert Bowman declared that he had a vision for a centerpiece &quot;tall building&quot; for the university. The Frick Acres property in Oakland was soon purchased and plans for the campus shifted focus from the hillside to a neo-Gothic Revival plan that today comprises the Cathedral of Learning, Heinz Memorial Chapel, Stephen Foster Memorial, and Clapp Hall buildings. By 1925, Bowman had settled on a design by Charles Klauder for the &quot;tall building&quot;: an attention-getting tower whose great height, with open spaces all around, would suggest the &quot;character that ought to be in an educated man.&quot; The building&#x27;s &quot;parallel lines going up and up...would express courage [and] fearlessness&quot; and it would &quot;unify Pittsburgh into a community conscious of its character.&quot; The cathedral is &quot;cut off&quot; flat at the top to suggest that its lines, like education, have no ending. The building was financed by donors and by a campaign to collect dimes from local school children. Bowman was a persuasive leader and although the Great Depression intervened, the Cathedral of Learning, on which construction was begun in 1926, began hosting classes in 1931 and was formally dedicated in 1937. Today, it remains the second tallest university building in the world and contains an equally impressive interior highlighted by a Gothic hall Commons Room with tall arches currently surrounded by 31 Nationality Rooms.

===Development of the polio vaccine===

In the early 20th century, epidemics of polio began to hit the United States and other industrialized countries. As hospitals filled with patients in iron lungs, and tens of thousands were left disabled, the fear of polio grew, leading to the closing of many public facilities. Meanwhile, Dr. Jonas Salk had set up the University of Pittsburgh&#x27;s Virus Research Lab in the basement of what is now Salk Hall. By 1951, Salk and his team had begun immunization experiments in monkeys using dead polio virus. Soon, however, Salk began to test inoculations in paralyzed polio patients and by 1953 human trials among the general population were initiated. By the spring of the following year, the largest controlled field trials in medical history were underway, and by 1955 the vaccine developed by Salk and his researchers was declared effective. By 1962, Salk&#x27;s vaccine had reduced the incidence of polio in the United States by 95 percent. The breakthroughs in immunology and vaccine development at Pitt by Salk and his team are considered one of the most significant scientific and medical achievements in history.

===State relations to present day===
In 1966, Pitt was designated by Pennsylvania as a state-related university. As such, Pitt receives public funds ($154.3 million in fiscal year 2016) covering about 7% of its operating budget, and offers reduced tuition to Pennsylvania residents. Pitt retains independent control. Upon affiliation with the state, subsidized tuition led to a massive influx of new students and rapid expansion of Pitt&#x27;s size and scope. In the 1970s, Pitt&#x27;s football team returned to greatness with a national championship season in 1976 led by Hall of Fame running back Tony Dorsett and continued success in the 1980s with players such as Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Marino. In the 1980s, significant medical research in the field of organ transplantation was conducted by Thomas Starzl, establishing Pitt as the world leader in the field of organ transplantation. In 1991, chancellor Wesley Posvar retired after 24 years in office. His administration is best known for elimination of the university&#x27;s debt from its 1960s financial crisis and for increasing the school&#x27;s prestige and endowment. Under Posvar, Pitt&#x27;s operating budget grew sevenfold to $630 million and its endowment tripled to $257 million.

Mark Nordenberg was chancellor of the university from 1995 to 2014 and led Pitt through a period of substantial progress, including a $2-billion capital-raising campaign that is over three quarters of the way toward achieving its goal and a $1-billion 12-year facilities plan. Major initiatives and events that have occurred during his tenure include the construction of the Petersen Events Center, a major expansion of on-campus housing, the growth of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and the restructuring of its relationship with the university, and a series of disruptive bomb threats that occurred in 2012.

Patrick D. Gallagher was named the 18th chancellor of the university and assumed the office on August 1, 2014.

==Campus==

The University of Pittsburgh&#x27;s main campus comprises approximately 132 urban acres (0.53 km2) located in Pittsburgh&#x27;s historic Oakland neighborhood. Much of the campus, including its centerpiece 42-story Cathedral of Learning, falls within the Oakland Civic Center/Schenley Farms National Historic District. The campus has been noted for its impressive architecture, and contains an eclectic mix of architecture that includes Greek revival, Neogothic, Italian Renaissance, and modern. It has been termed &quot;a theme park of replica buildings, representing the architecture of the past speaking to the present.&quot; The campus has won multiple Green Star Awards from the Professional Grounds Management Society.

The University of Pittsburgh&#x27;s main campus contains four contiguous sections: upper (sports complexes, residence halls); mid (Benedum, Chevron, Allen and Thaw Halls); lower (Cathedral of Learning, Union, Posvar Hall); and on the west end of campus, the medical center complex. The campus is bordered by Darragh Street/McKee Place to the west and Bellefield Avenue/Dithridge Street to the east; Forbes and Fifth avenues traverse the campus from west to east. Although generally within walking distance, the university also runs a bus and shuttle service between various campus locations and bordering neighborhoods.

The main campus is within walking distance of many recreational, cultural, and educational institutions in the Oakland neighborhood. The campus is adjacent to Schenley Plaza, the main branch of the Carnegie Public Library, the Carnegie Museums of Natural History and Art and the Carnegie Music Hall, as well as portions of Carnegie Mellon University. Carlow University is just west of campus, adjacent to the university&#x27;s medical center complexes. The main quad of Carnegie Mellon University, Central Catholic High School, and historic Schenley Park, site of the Phipps Conservatory &amp; Botanical Gardens, lie across Junction Hollow on the east end.

===Historic buildings===

Four Pitt buildings are individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places: Allegheny Observatory (in Pittsburgh&#x27;s Riverview Park on the Northside), the Cathedral of Learning, the Pittsburgh Athletic Association building, and the Ford Motor building. Twenty-one of Pitt&#x27;s buildings (including the 5 residence halls that make up Schenley Quadrangle, see below) are contributing properties to the Schenley Farms-Oakland Civic Center Historic District that has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district.

Due to the historical nature of various sites around Pitt&#x27;s buildings, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has placed historical markers outside the Allegheny Observatory, Posvar Hall, Salk Hall, Stephen Foster Memorial, and the William Pitt Union.
In addition, a Pennsylvania Historical Marker has been placed on campus near the Cathedral of Learning to mark the significance of the University of Pittsburgh itself. Another state historical marker has been placed to highlight the significance of Pitt&#x27;s involvement in the archaeological excavation at the Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Avella, Pennsylvania.

In addition, the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation has designated the following Pitt buildings as Pittsburgh Historic Landmarks: Allegheny Observatory, Allen Hall, Alumni Hall, Bellefield Hall, Chancellor&#x27;s Residence, Cathedral of Learning, the Cathedral of Learning interior rooms, Gardner Steel Conference Center, Heinz Memorial Chapel, Thaw Hall, Salk Hall, Schenley Quadrangle residence halls, Stephen Foster Memorial, the University Child Development Center, and the William Pitt Union.

Other Pitt buildings not designated individually as landmarks, but listed among the 16 Pitt-owned contributing properties to the Schenley Farms Historic District, include Clapp Hall, O&#x27;Hara Student Center, Ruskin Hall, Thackeray Hall, Frick Fine Arts Building, Music Building, and the University Club.

Historic structures within, adjacent to, or near Pitt&#x27;s campus, but not belonging to the university, include the Carnegie Museum buildings, Frick School, Forbes Field wall remnant, Magee Estate iron fence, the Schenley Fountain, Mellon Institute, Phipps Conservatory &amp; Botanical Gardens, the Pittsburgh Athletic Association, St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church, Schenley High School, Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall – where scenes of The Silence of the Lambs were filmed in 1990, and the Stephen Foster sculpture. Many of these buildings and their facilities are integrated into the events and activities of the university.

===Other buildings===
The majority of Pitt-owned facilities are clustered in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh which includes the Schenley Farms Historic District, however a few prominent facilities are scattered elsewhere throughout the city, including the adjacent Shadyside neighborhood. Pitt also maintains regional Pennsylvania campuses in Bradford, Greensburg, Johnstown, and Titusville, as well as a Computer Center in RIDC Park in Blawnox, the Plum Boro Science Center in Plum, the University of Pittsburgh Applied Research Center (U-PARC) in Harmarville, and the Pymatuning Laboratory of Ecology in Linesville. The university also has a major archeological research site, the Allen L. Cook Spring Creek Preserve, in Spring Creek, Wyoming.

Athletic facilities of the University of Pittsburgh Panthers that are located in Oakland in the upper campus and include the Charles L Cost Sports Center, Fitzgerald Field House, the Petersen Events Center, Trees Hall and Trees Field. An approximately $30 million upgrade of on-campus sports facilities, starting with the Petersen Sports Complex, includes new soccer, baseball, softball facilities, and helps clear a space for the future construction of a new track and field and band complex. Athletic facilities in Pittsburgh that are located outside of the Oakland neighborhood include Acrisure Stadium and the UPMC Sports Performance Complex.

Major on-campus residence halls include the Litchfield Towers, Schenley Quadrangle, Forbes Hall, Bouquet Gardens and Ruskin Hall located on the lower campus, Lothrop Hall on the medical campus, and Panther, Nordenberg Hall, and Sutherland halls located on the upper campus.

===University of Pittsburgh Medical Center===

The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) is consistently ranked in U.S. News &amp; World Report&#x27;s &quot;Honor Roll&quot; of America&#x27;s top hospitals and consists of the following hospitals and facilities in the Pittsburgh neighborhood of Oakland, many of which have shared uses with various University departments: UPMC Presbyterian Hospital, UPMC Montefiore Hospital, Magee-Women&#x27;s Hospital of UPMC, Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic in Thomas Detre Hall, Eye and Ear Institute, Forbes Tower (home to the School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences), Iroquois Building, Kaufman Medical Building, Medical Arts Building, 230 McKee Place, and UPMC University Center. UPMC academic hospitals and facilities elsewhere in Pittsburgh include the UPMC Children&#x27;s Hospital of Pittsburgh campus in the Lawrenceville neighborhood, the UPMC Sports Performance Complex on the South Side, and the UPMC Shadyside and the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute in the Hillman Cancer Center (both located in the Shadyside neighborhood adjacent to Oakland).

===Regional campuses===
Regional campuses offer master&#x27;s, bachelor&#x27;s, and associate degrees at four locations in Western Pennsylvania. They also allow students to take preliminary courses and relocate to other regional campuses or the Oakland campus to complete their degrees. They offer several degrees and certificates:
* University of Pittsburgh at Bradford – master&#x27;s, bachelor&#x27;s, associate&#x27;s and certificates
* University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg – master&#x27;s, bachelor&#x27;s and certificates
* University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown – bachelor&#x27;s and certificates
* University of Pittsburgh at Titusville – associate&#x27;s and certificates

==Community impact==

The University of Pittsburgh has been noted for both its role in community outreach and its impact on the economy of the city and the Western Pennsylvania region. In 2009, Pitt was ranked second overall, and the top public university in the nation, as a &quot;Best Neighbor&quot; for positive impact on its urban community, including both commercial and residential activities such as revitalization, cultural renewal, economics, and community service and development according to the &quot;Saviors of Our Cities&quot; ranking. Pitt was also listed as a &quot;best neighbor&quot; in the previous ranking released in 2006. These rankings reflect the statistics that each year Pitt spends more than $1.7 billion in the community and supports nearly 33,800 jobs in Allegheny County. The university is the Pittsburgh region&#x27;s second largest non-government employer behind its affiliated University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). Pitt&#x27;s research program alone imports more than $822 million into the region each year (more than $3.60 for each $1 of state appropriations), and supports some 23,100 local jobs. Pitt students also spend more than $213 million on goods, services, and rental payments within the local economy. Pitt ranked sixth in the number of startups spawned by technologies developed by its researchers according to Association of University Technology Managers.
Pitt and its medical school are the academic partners of the closely affiliated the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. With over 1450 employees and $1 billion annual revenue, UPMC is the largest non-government employer in Pennsylvania.

Through the Pitt Volunteer Pool, faculty and staff members donate more than 10,000 hours annually to community service projects for agencies such as the Salvation Army, Pittsburgh AIDS Task Force, and Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank.

Pitt is a leading producer of Peace Corps volunteers. According to the Peace Corps&#x27; 2008 ranking of colleges and universities, only 14 schools in the nation produced more Peace Corps volunteers. Pitt&#x27;s graduate school also ranked tenth for most alumni Peace Corps volunteers.

===Sustainability===

The University of Pittsburgh has undertaken programs to improve sustainability initiatives and practices. Pitt started programs in ecology and established biological field stations in 1926. In 1990, Pitt was one of the first 22 signatories of the Talloires Declaration. In 2003, Pitt founded its Mascaro Center for Sustainable Innovation. In 2013, Pitt released its first sustainability report and in 2014 celebrated a &quot;Year of Sustainability&quot; by launching a Student Office of Sustainability that now has over 25 affiliated student organizations. In 2018, Pitt published its first comprehensive &quot;Pitt Sustainability Plan&quot;, established the Office of Sustainability, and hired its first director of sustainability. In 2020, Pitt committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2037 (its 250th anniversary) and its first climate action plan came out in 2022.

Pitt received a AASHE STARS Gold rating in 2021, building on its Silver rating from 2018, has long been on The Princeton Review&#x27;s &quot;Green Colleges&quot; list, been included on the Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s Green Powered Universities list since 2018, won multiple Sustainable Pittsburgh Challenges, and has other third-party recognitions.

In 2018, the university announced its intention to buy all of the electricity from a run-of-the-river hydro power facility to be built by Rye Development at Allegheny Lock and Dam No. 2 on the Allegheny River in 2023. In 2020, the university announced a second local renewable power purchasing agreement, for solar power to be built on the border of Beaver and Allegheny counties near Pittsburgh International Airport.

The university has been criticized for some of its financial investments, namely those in the fossil fuel industry. In 2020, a Board report disclosed that endowment exposure to fossil fuels had decreased 42% between 2015 and 2020, with zero private investments in fossil fuels by the end of 2035.

==Organization and administration==

The university was chartered by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1787 and it operated as a fully private institution until an alteration to its charter in 1966 at which point it became part of the Commonwealth System of Higher Education. This conferred &quot;state-related&quot; status to the university making it a legal instrument of the Commonwealth which provides an annual financial appropriation, currently 7.7% of the university&#x27;s total operating budget, in exchange for the university offering tuition discounts to students who are residents of Pennsylvania. Legally, however, the university remains a private entity, operating under its nonprofit corporate charter, governed by its independent Board of Trustees, and with its assets under its own ownership and control. Therefore, it retains the freedom and individuality of a private institution, both administratively and academically, setting its own standards for admissions, awarding of degrees, faculty qualifications, teaching, and staff hiring.

The university&#x27;s board of trustees maintains ultimate legal authority, governance, and responsibility for the university but specifically reserves authority over selecting the university&#x27;s chancellor; approval of major policies, particularly those related to the fiduciary responsibilities of the board; and the definition of the university&#x27;s mission and goals. It is made up of 36 voting members: chancellor, 17 term trustees elected by the board, 6 alumni trustees elected by the board on nomination from the Alumni Association Board of directors, and 12 Commonwealth trustees. The governor of Pennsylvania, the president pro tempore of the Pennsylvania Senate, and the speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives each appoints four of the 12 Commonwealth trustees. Additional non-voting trustees include 14 special trustees and additional emeritus trustees selected by the board. Non-voting ex-officio members include the governor of Pennsylvania, the secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the chief executive of Allegheny County, and the mayor of Pittsburgh. There are three or more regular meetings of the Board of Trustees per year.

The Board of Trustees selects the university&#x27;s chancellor, who doubles as the chief academic officer and the chief executive of the university as well as serving as an ex officio voting member of the board of trustees. The chancellor is delegated with general administrative, academic, and management authority over the university. Under the chancellor are the provost and senior vice chancellor, the senior vice chancellor for health sciences, the deans of the various schools, the presidents of the regional campuses, department chairs, and the directors of university centers and institutes. The university is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools.

==Academics==
Throughout its history, Pitt has been committed to a liberal arts education with a curriculum in the arts, sciences, and humanities. Pitt also has emphasized undergraduate research experience and opportunities such as co-ops and internships. Undergraduate degrees can be earned as Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, and Bachelor of Philosophy. Along with providing certificate programs, graduate level master&#x27;s, professional, and doctoral degrees are also awarded. Pitt has also initiated a university-wide Outside the Classroom Curriculum (OCC) that includes a structured series of extracurricular programs and experiences designed to complement students&#x27; academic studies and help develop personal attributes and professional skills. Students who complete the OCC requirements receive an OCC &quot;transcript&quot; and a green cord of distinction to wear at commencement. Pitt offers free workshops and certification programs such as a pedagogy certification badge and a semester-long public education mentorship program. Distinguished undergraduate programs are offered through the David C. Frederick Honors College.

The freshman level entry schools include the Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences, the College of Business Administration, the Swanson School of Engineering, and the School of Nursing.

=== Undergraduate admissions ===
The 2022 annual ranking of &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; categorizes University of Pittsburgh as &quot;more selective&quot;. For the Class of 2026 (enrolled fall 2022), Pitt received 53,062 applications and accepted 26,077 (49.1%). Of those accepted, 4,399 enrolled, a yield rate (the percentage of accepted students who choose to attend the university) of 16.8%. Pitt&#x27;s freshman retention rate is 93.4%, with 84.3% going on to graduate within six years.

The university started test-optional admissions with the Fall 2021 incoming class in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and has extended this through Fall 2025. Of the 49% of enrolled freshmen in 2021 who submitted SAT scores; the middle 50 percent Composite scores were 1250–1470. Of the 16% of the incoming freshman class who submitted ACT scores; the middle 50 percent Composite score was between 28 and 33.

Pitt is a college-sponsor of the National Merit Scholarship Program and sponsored 3 Merit Scholarship awards in 2020. In the 2020–2021 academic year, 10 freshman students were National Merit Scholars.

===International studies===

The university&#x27;s historic emphasis on international studies is physically present in its collection of 31 Nationality Rooms on the first and third floors of the Cathedral of Learning. Pitt is also one of the country&#x27;s leading producers of both Fulbright scholars and Peace Corps volunteers, and one of fewer than 20 American universities to claim five or more area studies programs that have been competitively designated as National Resource Centers by the U.S. Department of Education.

Pitt&#x27;s National Resource Centers include Asian, European, Latin American, Russian and East European, and Global studies, as well as Pitt&#x27;s International Business Center. In addition, Pitt&#x27;s Asian Studies Center has been awarded status as a Confucius Institute by the Chinese Ministry of Education. Further, Pitt is home to one of just ten European Union Centers of Excellence in the U.S., funded by the European Commission.

The University Center for International Studies (UCIS) coordinates international education curricula, centers on topical specializations in international studies, and the centers for area studies, including the National Resource Centers, among existing faculty and departments throughout the university. It does not confer degrees, but awards certificates of attainment to degree candidates in the university&#x27;s schools and also operates certificate programs in African Studies (undergraduate) and in Global Studies (undergraduate &amp; graduate). UCIS also operates the Study Abroad Office, Nationality Rooms and Intercultural Exchange Programs.

Pitt&#x27;s study abroad program, under the auspices of UCIS, helps to facilitate student study in over a hundred different countries, and oversees a variety of programs including the Panther Programs, which are course taught abroad that have been developed and are accompanied by faculty of the university; two-way exchange agreements with foreign institutions; and Pitt-recognized, third-party exchange programs. The university also offers several study abroad scholarships, including those through the Nationality Rooms program. In addition, following the decision to end a 24-year sponsorship of the Semester at Sea program due to academic, administrative and safety concerns, Pitt has created a Multi-region Academic Program (PittMAP) that involves international travel, accompanied by university faculty, to three different continents for the comparative study of one of six rotating global study themes. Further, Pitt&#x27;s Swanson School of Engineering has also established a joint engineering institute and program with Sichuan University in Chengdu, and Pitt&#x27;s School of Medicine has established an exchange program for biomedical research students with Tsinghua University in Beijing, China.

==Research==

Pitt is a member of the Association of American Universities. The National Science Foundation ranked Pitt 18th among American universities for research and development expenditures in 2021 with $1.13 billion. Pitt ranked in the top 25 of all universities in the world for the impact and performance of its scientific public publications, including in the top ten for clinical medicine, according to the Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities produced by the Higher Education Evaluation and Accreditation Council of Taiwan. Pitt is also ranked 29th in the world based on Essential Science Indicators according to the Research Center for Chinese Science Evaluation of Wuhan University. Pitt places much emphasis on undergraduate research and has integrated such research experience as a key component of its undergraduate experience.

Pitt is a major center of biomedical research; in FY 2013, it ranked sixth in the nation in competitive peer-reviewed NIH funding allocations, and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center ranked tenth among hospitals nationwide by &quot;USNews&quot; in 2013.

Pitt neighbors the campus of Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), and in some cases, buildings of the two universities are intermingled. This helps to facilitate a myriad of academic and research collaborations between the two schools, including such projects as the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, the Pittsburgh Life Sciences Greenhouse, the Immune Modeling Center, the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition, the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, as well as the National Science Foundation-supported Pittsburgh Science of Learning Center. Further, the universities also offer multiple dual and joint degree programs such as the Medical Scientist Training Program, the Molecular Biophysics and Structural Biology Graduate Program, and the Law and Business Administration program. Some professors hold joint professorships between the two schools, and students at each university may take classes at the other (with appropriate approvals). Pitt students and faculty also have access to the CMU library system, as well as the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, through the Oakland Library Consortium. The two universities also co-host academic conferences, such as the 2012 Second Language Research Forum.

==Student life==
===Housing===

Undergraduate student housing comprises both traditional residence halls and apartment style housing.

===Traditions===
Several traditions have become part of student life at Pitt over the years. One of the oldest traditions is &quot;Lantern Night&quot;, an annual ceremony that serves as a formal induction for freshman women to university life. The tradition of sliding or stepping on the former home plate of Forbes Field embedded in the floor of Posvar Hall is performed by students in search of some good luck. Another good luck tradition involves rubbing the nose of the Millennium Panther outside the William Pitt Union prior to exams. Originated by students seeking good luck on exams, this tradition has further grown into one that is used by the wider university community when seeking general good fortune, particularly prior to football games or other athletic contests, and was featured in a national television advertisement for the 2012 Hyundai Tucson automobile. A romantic tradition involves the legend stating that if lovers kiss on the steps of Heinz Memorial Chapel, they are then destined to be married there. Perhaps the most prestigious tradition involves the Omicron Delta Kappa Walk, a stone walkway between the Cathedral of Learning and Heinz Chapel that contains the engraved names of Pitt&#x27;s Omicron Delta Kappa Senior of the Year award winners.

Annual traditional events include &quot;Fall Fest&quot;, and in the spring, &quot;Bigelow Bash&quot;. These festivals are held by the Pitt Program Council between the William Pitt Union and the Cathedral of Learning and involve a range of activities, novelties, and bands. Related to graduation, there is Honors Convocation, where awards and recognition are bestowed upon students, faculty, alumni, and staff throughout the schools and departments of the university. Also, the &quot;Panther Sendoff&quot; is a free annual reception typically held in Alumni Hall to congratulate each year&#x27;s graduating class and wish them well. A free event open to the public, the Nationality Rooms Open House occurs on a Sunday in early December each year in the Cathedral of Learning and involves the presentation of the rooms decorated in traditional holiday styles, day-long performances of dance and song by various ethnic groups, and food and crafts from many of the nationality room&#x27;s committees.
Traditions related to athletics include the &quot;Victory Lights&quot;, where golden flood lights illuminate the top of the Cathedral of Learning after every football victory and select other athletic achievements. The Annual Bonfire and Pep Rally which is hosted by the Pitt Program Council and is held prior to a select football game. Held on the lawn of the Cathedral of Learning, it often involves the band, cheerleaders, football team, visiting dignitaries, and giveaways. Homecoming, which revolves around another home football game each year, includes a traditional fireworks and a laser-light display between the William Pitt Union and the Cathedral of Learning. The Varsity Walk, a walkway between the Cathedral of Learning and Heinz Memorial Chapel, is carved each year the names of former Pitt athletes (each year since 1950) who have promoted the university through their athletic (Panther Award) or academic (Blue-Gold Award) achievements.

&quot;Greek Week&quot; is a yearlong initiative for the Greek organizations on campus to raise money for different charitable organizations through different events. The two biggest events each year are the Pitt Dance Marathon and Greek Sing. Yearlong fundraising activities are also held to support such charitable organizations such as the Ronald McDonald House, Make a Wish Foundation, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, and the Pittsburgh Food Bank. &quot;E-Week&quot; is a spring celebration organized by the Engineer Student Council for a week-long series of activities and competitions to demonstrate engineering skills and foster a spirit of camaraderie. Activities include games such as Monopoly, Ingenuity, Jeopardy, Assassins, and include a talent show, relay race, mini-Olympics, and blood drive. The festivities reach climax with a parade on Friday, a soapbox derby on Saturday, and the &quot;e-ball finale&quot; on Saturday evening. Each year, a unique theme is chosen. Each engineering department competes against the others, while some smaller departments join forces.

<doc id="239871" wikidata="Q716132" url="?curid=239871" title="Cordia">
<text>Cordia is a genus of flowering plants in the borage family, Boraginaceae. It contains 228 species of shrubs and trees, that are found in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. Many of the species are commonly called manjack, while  may refer to several Central American species in Spanish.

The generic name honours German botanist and pharmacist Valerius Cordus (1515–1544). Like most other Boraginaceae, the majority have trichomes (hairs) on the leaves.

==Taxonomy==
The taxonomy of &quot;Cordia&quot; is complex and controversial. Gottschling et al. (2005) say this is partly due to &quot;extraordinarily high intraspecific variability&quot; in some groups of species, making identification difficult, and partly due to new taxa having been &quot;airily described on the basis of poorly preserved herbarium specimens&quot;.

===Selected species===
*&quot;Cordia africana&quot; – White manjack
*&quot;Cordia alliodora&quot; – Spanish elm, Ecuador laurel, salmwood, bocote (Neotropics)
*&quot;Cordia boissieri&quot; – Anacahuita, Texas olive (southern Texas, Northern Mexico)
*&quot;Cordia curassavica&quot; – Black sage, wild sage
*&quot;Cordia dentata&quot; – White manjack
*&quot;Cordia dichotoma&quot; – Fragrant manjack, bird lime tree (Tropical Asia and Australasia)
*&quot;Cordia leucophlyctis&quot; – (endemic to the Galápagos Islands)
*&quot;Cordia lutea&quot; – Yellow cordia (western South America, including the Galápagos Islands)
*&quot;Cordia monoica&quot;
*&quot;Cordia myxa&quot; – Assyrian plum (South Asia)&quot;Cordia domestica&quot; is treated as a separate species by some sources, and as &quot;C. myxa&quot; var. &quot;domestica&quot; by others. &quot;Cordia obliqua&quot; (the clammy cherry) has been placed in the &quot;&quot;Cordia myxa&quot; complex&quot;, or treated as a synonym for &quot;Cordia dichotoma&quot;.
*&quot;Cordia platythyrsa&quot; – West African cordia
*&quot;Cordia rupicola&quot; – Puerto Rico manjack (Puerto Rico)
*&quot;Cordia sebestena&quot; – Geiger tree, large-leaf Geigertree (southern Florida, Greater Antilles, Central America)
*&quot;Cordia sinensis&quot; (=&quot;C. gharaf&quot;) – Grey-leafed saucerberry
*&quot;Cordia subcordata&quot; – &quot;Kou&quot;, &quot;tou&quot;, &quot;marer&quot; (Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia, northern Australia, Pacific Islands)
*&quot;Cordia sulcata&quot; – Mucilage manjack, laylay, white manjack, wild clammy cherry
*&quot;Cordia trichotoma&quot; 
===Formerly placed here===
* &quot;Carmona retusa&quot; (as &quot;C. retusa&quot; )

==Ecology==
&quot;Cordia&quot; species are used as food plants by the caterpillars of some Lepidoptera species, such as &quot;Endoclita malabaricus&quot;, &quot;Bucculatrix caribbea&quot;, and &quot;Bucculatrix cordiaella&quot;. The wild olive tortoise beetle (&quot;Physonota alutacea&quot;) feeds on &quot;C. boissieri&quot;, &quot;C. dentata&quot;, &quot;C. inermis&quot;, and &quot;C. macrostachya&quot;.

==Uses==
===Ornamental===
Many members of this genus have fragrant, showy flowers and are popular in gardens, although they are not especially hardy.

===As food===
A number of the tropical species have edible fruits, known by a wide variety of names including clammy cherries, glue berries, sebesten, or snotty gobbles. In India, the fruits of local species are used as a vegetable, raw, cooked, or pickled, and are known by many names, including &quot;lasora&quot; in Hindi. One such species is fragrant manjack (&quot;C. dichotoma&quot;), which is called &quot;gunda&quot; or &quot;tenti dela&quot; in Hindi and &quot;lasura&quot; in Nepali. The fruit of the fragrant manjack is called &quot;phoà-pò·-chí&quot; (破布子), 樹子仔, or 樹子(Pe̍h-ōe-jī: chhiū-chí) in Taiwan where they are eaten pickled.

===Glue===
The white, gooey inner pulp of the fruits is traditionally used to make glue.

=== Wood ===
The wood of several &quot;Cordia&quot; species is commercially harvested. Ecuador laurel (&quot;C. alliodora&quot;), &quot;ziricote&quot; (&quot;C. dodecandra&quot;), Spanish elm (&quot;C. gerascanthus&quot;), and &quot;C. goeldiana&quot; are used to make furniture and doors in Central and South America.

&quot;Ziricote&quot; and &quot;bocote&quot; are sometimes used as tonewoods for making the backs and sides of high-end acoustic guitars such as the Richard Thompson signature model from Lowden. Similarly, drums are made from &quot;C. abyssinica&quot;, &quot;C. millenii&quot;, and &quot;C. platythyrsa&quot; due to the resonance of the wood.

=== Smoking ===
Cordia leaves can be dried and used to smoke marijuana with.

<text>Fluvoxamine, sold under the brand name Luvox among others, is an antidepressant of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class. It is primarily used to treat major depressive disorder and, perhaps more-especially, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), but is also used to treat anxiety disorders such as panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder.

Fluvoxamine&#x27;s side-effect profile is similar to that of other SSRIs. Common adverse effects include constipation, gastrointestinal problems, headache, anxiety, irritation, sexual problems, dry mouth, sleep problems and an increased risk of suicide at the start of treatment. These effects appear to be significantly weaker than with other SSRIs, with the exception of gastrointestinal side-effects.

Fluvoxamine appears to be more tolerable than other SSRIs, particularly with respect to cardiovascular complications. Compared to escitalopram and sertraline, fluvoxamine&#x27;s gastrointestinal profile may be less intense, often being limited to nausea. Mosapride has demonstrated efficacy in treating fluvoxamine-induced nausea. It is also advised practice to divide total daily doses of fluvoxamine greater than 100 milligrams, with the higher fraction being taken in the evening (e.g., 50 mg at the beginning of the waking day and 200 mg at bedtime). In any case, high starting daily doses of fluvoxamine rather than the recommended gradual titration (starting at 50 milligrams and gradually titrating, up to 300 if necessary) may increase the likelihood of nausea.

It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.

==Medical uses==
In many countries (e.g., Australia, the United Kingdom, and Russia) it is commonly used for major depressive disorder. Fluvoxamine is also approved in the United States for obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), and social anxiety disorder. In Japan, it is also approved to treat OCD, social anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder. Fluvoxamine is indicated for children and adolescents with OCD. The NICE guidelines in the United Kingdom have, as of 2005, authorized its use for obsessive-compulsive disorder in adults and adolescents of any age and children over the age of 7.

There is evidence that fluvoxamine is effective for generalised social anxiety in adults, although, as with other SSRIs, some of the results may be compromised by having been funded by pharmaceutical companies. Of the SSRIs, however, fluvoxamine, paroxetine and sertraline do appear consistent as viable treatments for generalised social anxiety. 

Fluvoxamine is also effective for treating a range of anxiety disorders in children and adolescents, including generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder and separation anxiety disorder.

The drug works long-term, and retains its therapeutic efficacy for at least one year.

The average therapeutic dose for fluvoxamine is 100 to 300 mg/day, with 300 mg being the upper daily limit normally recommended. Obsessive-compulsive disorder, however, often requires higher doses; doses of up to 450 mg/day may be prescribed in this case. The (off-label) upper daily limits for other serotonin-reuptake inhibitors used in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder, by analogy, are 400mg for sertraline, 100 mg for paroxetine, 120 mg for both fluoxetine and citalopram, 60 mg for escitalopram and 300 mg for clomipramine.

In any case with fluvoxamine, treatment is generally begun at 50 mg and increased in 50 mg increments every 4 to 7 days until a therapeutic optimum is reached.

== Interactions ==

Fluvoxamine inhibits the following cytochrome P450 enzymes:
* CYP1A2 (strongly) which metabolizes agomelatine, amitriptyline, caffeine, clomipramine, clozapine, duloxetine, haloperidol, imipramine, phenacetin, tacrine, tamoxifen, theophylline, olanzapine, etc.
* CYP3A4 (moderately) which metabolizes alprazolam, aripiprazole, clozapine, haloperidol, quetiapine, pimozide, ziprasidone, etc.
* CYP2D6 (weakly) which metabolizes aripiprazole, chlorpromazine, clozapine, codeine, fluoxetine, haloperidol, olanzapine, oxycodone, paroxetine, perphenazine, pethidine, risperidone, sertraline, thioridazine, zuclopenthixol, etc.
* CYP2C9 (moderately) which metabolizes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, phenytoin, sulfonylureas, etc.
* CYP2C19 (strongly) which metabolizes clonazepam, diazepam, phenytoin, etc.
* CYP2B6 (weakly) which metabolizes bupropion, cyclophosphamide, sertraline, tamoxifen, valproate, etc.

By so doing, fluvoxamine can increase serum concentration of the substrates of these enzymes.

Fluvoxamine may also elevate plasma levels of olanzapine by approximately two times. Combined olanzapine and fluvoxamine, which may cause increased sedation, should be used cautiously and controlled clinically and by therapeutic drug monitoring to avoid olanzapine induced adverse effects and/or intoxication.

The plasma levels of oxidatively metabolized benzodiazepines (e.g., triazolam, midazolam, alprazolam and diazepam) are likely to be increased when co-administered with fluvoxamine. However, the clearance of benzodiazepines metabolized by glucuronidation (e.g., lorazepam; oxazepam, which is coincidentally a metabolite of diazepam; temazepam) are not affected by fluvoxamine and may be safely taken alongside fluvoxamine should concurrent treatment with a benzodiazepine be necessary. Additionally, it appears that benzodiazepines metabolized by nitro-reduction (clonazepam, nitrazepam) may also, in a somewhat similar vein, be unlikely to be affected by fluvoxamine.

Using fluvoxamine and alprazolam together can increase alprazolam plasma concentrations. If alprazolam is coadministered with fluvoxamine, the initial alprazolam dose should be reduced to the lowest effective dose.

Fluvoxamine and ramelteon coadministration is not indicated.

Fluvoxamine has been observed to increase serum concentrations of mirtazapine, which is mainly metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, by three- to four-fold in humans. Caution and adjustment of dosage as necessary are warranted when combining fluvoxamine and mirtazapine.

Fluvoxamine seriously affects the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine and increases the intensity and duration of its effects. Because of the potentially hazardous consequences, the concomitant use of tizanidine with fluvoxamine, or other potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, should be avoided.

When a beta-blocker is required, atenolol, pindolol and, possibly, metoprolol may be safer choices than propranolol, as the latter&#x27;s metabolism is seriously, potentially dangerously, inhibited by fluvoxamine. Indeed, fluvoxamine may increase propranolol blood-levels by five-fold.

Clomipramine increases fluvoxamine levels and, conversely-likewise, fluvoxamine increases clomipramine levels (thereby its serotoninergic potential) and inhibits its metabolism to its strongly-noradrenergic metabolite, norclomipramine.

==Pharmacology==
===Pharmacodynamics===
Fluvoxamine is a potent selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor with around 100-fold affinity for the serotonin transporter over the norepinephrine transporter. It has negligible affinity for the dopamine transporter or any other site, with the sole exception of the σ1 receptor. It behaves as a potent agonist at this receptor and has the highest affinity (36 nM) of any SSRI for doing so. This may contribute to its antidepressant and anxiolytic effects and may also afford it some efficacy in treating the cognitive symptoms of depression. It increases concentrations of the neurosteroid allopregnanolone, which may also contribute to its anxiolytic effects. Unlike some other SSRIs, fluvoxamine&#x27;s metabolites are pharmacologically neutral.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Literature reviews have stated that fluvoxamine is metabolized primarily by CYP2D6 and to a minor extent by CYP1A2. However, CYP2D6 poor metabolizers do not have considerably higher fluvoxamine levels than extensive metabolizers. The Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) label (last revised 2023) states that the specific enzymes involved in fluvoxamine are not definitively known and that &quot;in vitro&quot; data suggest that it is mainly metabolized by CYP1A2 and may also be metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 to a much lesser extent.

==History==
Fluvoxamine was developed by Kali-Duphar, part of Solvay Pharmaceuticals, Belgium, now Abbott Laboratories, and introduced as Floxyfral in Switzerland in 1983. It was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1994, and introduced as Luvox in the US. In India, it is available, among several other brands, as Uvox by Abbott. It was one of the first SSRI antidepressants to be launched, and is prescribed in many countries to patients with major depression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cochrane 2010/2013&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first SSRI, a non-TCA drug, approved by the U.S. FDA specifically for the treatment of OCD. At the end of 1995, more than ten million patients worldwide had been treated with fluvoxamine. Fluvoxamine was the first SSRI to be registered for the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder in children by the FDA in 1997. In Japan, fluvoxamine was the first SSRI to be approved for the treatment of depression in 1999 and was later in 2005 the first drug to be approved for the treatment of social anxiety disorder. Fluvoxamine was the first SSRI approved for clinical use in the United Kingdom. Manufacturers include BayPharma, Synthon, and Teva, among others.

== Research directions ==
While early studies have suggested potential benefits for fluvoxamine as an anti-inflammatory agent and a possible impact on reducing cytokine storms, further studies did not confirm this expected benefit on COVID-19 patients. A cytokine storm refers to an excessive immune response characterized by a release of large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

In May 2022, based on a review of available scientific evidence, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) chose not to issue an emergency use authorization covering the use of fluvoxamine to treat COVID-19, saying that, at the time, the data was not sufficient to conclude that fluvoxamine may be effective in treating non-hospitalized people with COVID-19 to prevent serious illness or hospitalization. The agency stated that study results suggest that further clinical trials may be warranted.

A large double-blind randomized controlled trial called ACTIV-6, published in 2023 in &quot;JAMA&quot;, revealed that taking 200 mg of fluvoxamine every day for about two weeks was not significantly better than placebo at shortening the duration of mild or moderate COVID-19 symptoms.

There is tentative evidence that fluvoxamine may reduce the overall morbidity of COVID-19 and complications thereof.

==Environment==
Fluvoxamine is a common finding in waters near human settlement. Christensen &quot;et al.&quot; 2007 finds it is &quot;very toxic to aquatic organisms&quot; by European Union standards.

<text>Sales promotion is one of the elements of the promotional mix. The primary elements in the promotional mix are advertising, personal selling, direct marketing and publicity/public relations. Sales promotion uses both media and non-media marketing communications for a predetermined, limited time to increase consumer demand, stimulate market demand or improve product availability. Examples include contests, coupons, freebies, loss leaders, point of purchase displays, premiums, prizes, product samples, and rebates.

Sales promotions can be directed at either the customer, sales staff, or distribution channel members (such as retailers). Sales promotions targeted at the consumer are called consumer sales promotions. Sales promotions targeted at retailers and wholesale are called trade sales promotions.

Sales promotion includes several communications activities that attempt to provide added value or incentives to consumers, wholesalers, retailers, or other organizational customers to stimulate immediate sales. These efforts can attempt to stimulate product interest, trial, or purchase. Examples of devices used in sales promotion include coupons, samples, premiums, point-of-purchase (POP) displays, contests, rebates, and sweepstakes.

Sales promotion is implemented to attract new customers, hold present customers, counteract competition, and take advantage of opportunities that are revealed by market research. It is made up of activities, both outside and inside activities, to enhance company sales. Outside sales promotion activities include advertising, publicity, public relations activities, and special sales events. Inside sales promotion activities include window displays, product and promotional material display and promotional programs such as premium awards and contests.

Sale promotions often come in the form of discounts. Discounts impact the way consumers think and behave when shopping. The type of savings and its location can affect the way consumers view a product and affect their purchase decisions. The two most common discounts are price discounts (&quot;on sale items&quot;) and bonus packs (&quot;bulk items&quot;). Price discounts are the reduction of an original sale by a certain percentage while bonus packs are deals in which the consumer receives more for the original price. Many companies present different forms of discounts in advertisements, hoping to convince consumers to buy their products.

== Definition ==
Sales promotion represents a variety of techniques used to stimulate the purchase of a product or brand. Sales promotion has a tactical, rather than strategic role in marketing communications and brand strategy, it is also a form of advertisement used within a short period of time. Researchers Farhangmehr and Brito reviewed the definitions of sales promotions in marketing texts and journals and identified a set of common characteristics of sales promotion, including:
* Short-term effects and duration;
* Operates and influences only the last phase of the purchase process;
* Exhibits a secondary role in relation to other forms of marketing communication;
* Performs an accessory role regarding the product&#x27;s core benefits
* Is not a single technique, rather it is a set of techniques used for a specific purpose
Both manufacturers and retailers make extensive use of sales promotions. Retailer-sponsored sales promotions are directed at consumers. Manufacturers use two types of sales promotion, namely:

:1. &quot;Consumer sales promotions&quot;: Sales promotions targeted at consumers or end-users and designed to stimulate the actual purchase
:2. &quot;Trade promotions&quot;: Sales promotions targeted at trade, especially retailers, designed to increase sales to retailers, to carry the product or brand or to support the retailer in consumer-oriented promotions

Sales promotion is useful when:
:1. The product is newly introduced.
:2. There is excess inventory.
:3. Penetration or entry into a competitors stronghold.
:4. The product are likely to be perished if not sold or used.

The effect of sales promotion may not persist unless other marketing is used to create brand loyalty.

== Types ==
Consumer sales promotions are short-term techniques designed to achieve short-term objectives, such as to stimulate a purchase, encourage store traffic or simply to build excitement for a product or brand. Traditional sales promotions techniques include:
* Price deal: A temporary reduction in the price, such as 50% off.
* Loyal Reward Program: Consumers collect points, miles, or credits for purchases and redeem them for rewards.
* Cents-off deal: Offers a brand at a lower price. The price reduction may be a percentage marked on the package.
* Price-pack/Bonus packs deal: The packaging offers a consumer a certain percentage more of the product for the same price (for example, 25 percent extra). This is another type of deal &quot;in which customers are offered more of the product for the same price&quot;. For example, a sales company may offer their consumers a bonus pack in which they can receive two products for the price of one. In these scenarios, this bonus pack is framed as a gain because buyers believe that they are obtaining a free product. The purchase of a bonus pack, however, is not always beneficial for the consumer. Sometimes consumers will end up spending money on an item they would not normally buy had it not been in a bonus pack. As a result, items bought in a bonus pack are often wasted and is viewed as a &quot;loss&quot; for the consumer.
* Coupons: Coupons have become a standard mechanism for sales promotions.
* Loss leader: The price of a popular product is temporarily reduced below cost in order to stimulate other profitable sales
* Free-standing insert (FSI): A coupon booklet is inserted into the local newspaper for delivery.
* Checkout dispensers: On checkout, the customer is given a coupon based on products purchased.
* Mobile couponing: Coupons are available on a mobile phone. Consumers show the offer on a mobile phone to a salesperson for redemption.
* Online interactive promotion game: Consumers play an interactive game associated with the promoted product.
* Rebates: Consumers are offered a money-back if the receipt and barcode are mailed to the producer.
* Contests/sweepstakes/games: The consumer is automatically entered into the event by purchasing the product.
* Point-of-sale displays:
** Aisle interrupter: A sign that juts into the aisle from the shelf.
** Dangler: A sign that sways when a consumer walks by it.
** Dump bin: A bin full of products dumped inside.
** Bidding portals: Getting prospects
** Glorifier: A small stage that elevates a product above other products.
** Wobbler: A sign that jiggles.
** Lipstick Board: A board on which messages are written in crayon.
** Necker: A coupon placed on the &#x27;neck&#x27; of a bottle.
** YES unit: &quot;Your extra salesperson&quot; is a pull-out fact sheet.
** Electroluminescent: Solar-powered, animated light in motion.
* Kids eat free specials: Offers a discount on the total dining bill by offering 1 free kids meal with each regular meal purchased.
* Sampling: Consumers get one sample for free, after their trial and then could decide whether to buy or not.

New technologies have provided a range of new opportunities for sales promotions. Loyalty cards, personal shopping assistants, electronic shelf labels, and electronic advertising displays allow for more personalized communications and more targeted information at the point of purchase. For example, shoppers may receive alerts for special offers when they approach a product in a specific aisle.

=== Online deals vs. In-store deals ===
There are different types of discounts available online versus in the stores. On-shelf couponing: Coupons are present at the shelf where the product is available. On-line couponing: Coupons are available online. Consumers print them out and take them to the store. Although discounts can be found online and in stores, there is a different thought process when shopping in each location. For example, &quot;online shoppers are more price-sensitive because of the readily available low search cost and direct price comparisons&quot;. Consumers can easily go to other websites and find better deals as opposed to physically going to various stores. In addition, buyers tend to refrain from purchasing bonus packs online because of the skepticism (of fraud and scams) that may come with the deal. Since &quot;...bonus packs are more difficult than price discounts to process online, they are more difficult and effortful for the consumer to understand&quot;. For example, a buy-one-get-one-free deal on a website requires more work than the same bonus pack offered in a store. Online, consumers have to deal with payment processing, shipping and handling fees, and days waiting for the products&#x27; arrival, while in a store, the products are available without those additional steps and delays.

== Trade promotion techniques ==
* Trade allowances: Short-term incentive offered to induce a retailer to stock up on a product.
* Dealer loader: An incentive given to induce a retailer to purchase and display a product.
* Trade contest: A contest to reward retailers that sell the most product.
* Point-of-purchase displays: Used to create the urge of &quot;impulse&quot; buying and selling your product on the spot.
* Training programs: Dealer employees are trained in selling the product.
* Push money: Also known as &quot;spiffs.&quot; An extra commission paid to retail employees to push products.
* Trade discounts (also called functional discounts): These are payments to distribution channel members for performing some function.

== Consumer thought process ==

=== Meaningful savings: gain or loss ===
Many discounts are designed to give consumers the perception of saving money when buying products, but not all discounted prices are viewed as favorable to buyers. Therefore, before making a purchase, consumers may weigh their options as either a gain or a loss to avoid the risk of losing money on a purchase. A &quot;gain&quot; view on a purchase results in chance taking For example, if there is a buy-one-get-one-half-off discount that seems profitable, a shopper will buy the product. On the other hand, a &quot;loss&quot; viewpoint results in consumer aversion to taking any chances. For instance, consumers will pass on a buy-three-get-one-half-off discount if they believe they are not benefitting from the deal. Specifically, consumers will consider their options because &quot;...the sensation of loss is 2.5 times greater than the sensation of gain for the same value&quot;.

=== Impulse buying ===
Impulse buying results from consumers&#x27; failure to weigh their options before buying a product. Impulse buying is &quot;any purchase that a shopper makes that has not been planned... [and is] sudden and immediate&quot;. For example, if a consumer has no intention of buying a product before entering a store, but purchases an item without any forethought, that was impulse buying. Product manufactures want to promote and encourage this instant purchase impulse in consumers. Buyers can be very quick to make purchases without thinking about the consequences when a product is perceived to be a good deal. Therefore, sales companies &quot;increasingly implement promotional campaigns that will be effective in triggering consumer impulse buying behavior&quot; to increase sales and profits

=== Comparing prices ===
Many consumers read left-to-right, and therefore, compare prices in the same manner. For example, if the price of a product is $93 and the sales price is $79, people will initially compare the left digits first (9 and 7) and notice the two digit difference. However, because of this habitual behavior, &quot;consumers may perceive the ($14) difference between $93 and $79 as greater than the ($14) difference between $89 and $75&quot;. As a result, consumers often mistakenly believe they are receiving a better deal with the first set of prices based on the left digits solely.

=== Right digit effect ===
The right digit effect focuses on the right digits of prices when the left digits are the same. In other words, prices like $45 and $42 force consumers to pay more attention to the right digits (the 2 and 5) to determine the discount received. This effect also &quot;implies that consumers will perceive larger discounts for prices with small right digit endings, than for large right digit endings. For example, in a $32-to-$31 price reduction, consumers will believe to have received a greater deal than a $39-to-$38 price reduction. As a result, companies may use discounts with smaller right digits to mislead consumers into thinking they are receiving a better deal and increasing profit. However, consumers also are deceived by the infamous 9-ending prices. &quot;The right digit effect [also] relates to consumers&#x27; tendency to identify 9-ending prices as sale (rather than regular) prices or to associate them with a discount.

=== Framing effect ===
The Framing effect is &quot;the phenomenon that occurs when there is a change in an individual&#x27;s preference between two or more alternatives caused by the way the problem is presented&quot;. In other words, the format in which something is presented will affect a person&#x27;s viewpoint. This theory consists of three subcategories: risky choice framing, attribute framing and goal framing. Risky choice framing references back to the gain-or-loss thought processes of consumers. Consumers will take chances if the circumstance is profitable for them and avoid chance-taking if it is not. Attribute framing deals with one key phrase or feature of a price discount that is emphasized to inspire consumer shopping. For example, the terms &quot;free&quot; and &quot;better&quot; are used commonly to lure in shoppers to buy a product. Goal framing places pressure on buyers to act hastily or face the consequences of missing out on a definite price reduction. A &quot;limited time only&quot; (LTO) deal, for example, attempts to motivate buyers to make a purchase quickly, or buy on impulse, before the time runs out.

=== Outside forces ===
Although there are aspects that can determine a consumer&#x27;s shopping behavior, there are many outside factors that can influence the shoppers&#x27; decision in making a purchase. For example, even though a product&#x27;s price is discounted, the quality of that product may dissuade the consumer from buying the item. If the product has poor customer reviews or has a short &quot;life span,&quot; shoppers will view that purchase as a loss and avoid taking a chance on it. A product can also be viewed negatively because of consumers&#x27; past experiences and expectations. For example, if the size of a product is misleading, buyers will not want to buy it. An item advertised as &quot;huge,&quot; but is only one inch tall, will ward off consumers. Also, &quot;the effects of personal characteristics, such as consumers&#x27; gender, subjective norms, and impulsivity&quot; can also affect a consumer&#x27;s purchase intentions. For example, a female will, generally, purchase a cosmetic product more often than a male. In addition, &quot;some...shoppers may be unable to buy [a product]...because of financial constraints&quot;.

== Regulation ==
Sales promotions have traditionally been heavily regulated in many advanced industrial nations, with the notable exception of the United States. For example, the United Kingdom formerly operated under a resale price maintenance regime in which manufacturers could legally dictate the minimum resale price for virtually all goods; this practice was abolished in 1964.

Most European countries also have controls on the scheduling and permissible types of sales promotions, as they are regarded in those countries as bordering upon unfair business practices. Germany is notorious for having the most strict regulations. Famous examples include the car wash that was barred from giving free car washes to regular customers and a baker who could not give a free cloth bag to customers who bought more than 10 rolls.

<text>Anthimus I of Constantinople (Greek: Ἄνθιμος; died 548) was a Miaphysite, patriarch of Constantinople from 535–536. He was the bishop or archbishop of Trebizond before accession to the Constantinople see. He was deposed by Pope Agapetus I for adhering to Miaphysitism (the belief that Jesus had only one nature completely divine and human) before 13 March 536, and later hidden by Theodora in her quarters for 12 years, until her death.

<doc id="239880" wikidata="Q22290476" url="?curid=239880" title="Reuptake">
<text>Reuptake is the reabsorption of a neurotransmitter by a neurotransmitter transporter located along the plasma membrane of an axon terminal (i.e., the pre-synaptic neuron at a synapse) or glial cell after it has performed its function of transmitting a neural impulse.

Reuptake is necessary for normal synaptic physiology because it allows for the recycling of neurotransmitters and regulates the level of neurotransmitter present in the synapse, thereby controlling how long a signal resulting from neurotransmitter release lasts. Because neurotransmitters are too large and hydrophilic to diffuse through the membrane, specific transport proteins are necessary for the reabsorption of neurotransmitters. Much research, both biochemical and structural, has been performed to obtain clues about the mechanism of reuptake.

==Protein structure==
The first primary sequence of a reuptake protein was published in 1990. The technique for protein sequence determination relied upon the purification, sequencing, and cloning of the transporter protein in question, or expression cloning strategies in which transport function was used as an assay for cDNA species coding for that transporter. After separation, it was realized that there were many similarities between the two DNA sequences. Further exploration in the field of reuptake proteins found that many of the transporters associated with important neurotransmitters within the body were also very similar in sequence to the GABA and norepinephrine transporters. The members of this new family include transporters for dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, glycine, proline and GABA. They were called Na+/Cl− dependent neurotransmitter transporters. Sodium and chloride ion dependence will be discussed later in the mechanism of action. Using the commonalities among sequences and hydropathy plot analyses, it was predicted that there are 12 hydrophobic membrane spanning regions in the &#x27;Classical&#x27; transporter family. In addition to this, the N- and C-termini exist in the intracellular space. These proteins also all have an extended extracellular loop between the third and fourth transmembrane sequences. Site-directed chemical labeling experiments verified the predicted topological organization of the serotonin transporter.

In addition to neurotransmitter transporters, many other proteins in both animals and prokaryotes were found with similar sequences, indicating a larger family of Neurotransmitter: Sodium Symporters (NSS). One of these proteins, LeuT, from &quot;Aquifex aeolicus&quot;, was crystallized by Yamashita et al. with very high resolution, revealing a molecule of leucine and two Na+ ions bound near the center of the protein. They found that the transmembrane (TM) helices 1 and 6 contained unwound segments in the middle of the membrane. Along with these two helices, TM helices 3 and 8 and the areas surrounding the unwound sections of 1 and 6 formed the substrate and sodium ion binding sites. The crystal structure revealed pseudo-symmetry in LeuT, in which the structure of TM helices 1-5 is reflected in the structure of helices 6–10.

There is an extracellular cavity in the protein, into which protrudes a helical hairpin formed by extracellular loop EL4. In TM1, an aspartate distinguishes monoamine NSS transporters from amino acid transporters which contain a glycine at the same position. External and internal &quot;gates&quot; were assigned to pairs of negatively and positively charged residues in the extracellular cavity and near the cytoplasmic ends of TM helices 1 and 8.

==Mechanism of action==
The classic transporter proteins use transmembrane ion gradients and electrical potential to transport neurotransmitter across the membrane of the presynaptic neuron. Typical neurotransmitter sodium symport (NSS) transporters, which are Na+ and Cl− ion dependent, take advantage of both Na+ and Cl− gradients, inwardly directed across the membrane. The ions flow down their concentration gradients, in many cases leading to transmembrane charge movement that is enhanced by the membrane potential. These forces pull the neurotransmitter substrate into the cell, even against its own concentration gradient. At a molecular level, Na+ ions stabilize amino acid binding at the substrate site and also hold the transporter in an outward-open conformation that allows substrate binding. The role of the Cl− ion in the symport mechanism has been proposed to be for stabilizing the charge of the symported Na+.

After ion and substrate binding have taken place, some conformational change must occur. From the conformational differences between the structure of TMs 1-5 and that of TMs 6–10, and from the identification of a substrate permeation pathway between the binding site of SERT and the cytoplasm, a mechanism for conformational change was proposed in which a four-helix bundle composed of TMs 1, 2, 6 and 7 changes its orientation within the rest of the protein. A structure of LeuT in the inward-open conformation subsequently demonstrated that the major component of the conformational change represents movement of the bundle relative to the rest of the protein.

==Mechanism of reuptake inhibition==
The main objective of a reuptake inhibitor is to substantially decrease the rate by which neurotransmitters are reabsorbed into the presynaptic neuron, increasing the concentration of neurotransmitter in the synapse. This increases neurotransmitter binding to pre- and postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptors. Depending on the neuronal system in question, a reuptake inhibitor can have drastic effects on cognition and behavior. Non-competitive inhibition of the bacterial homologue LeuT by tricyclic antidepressants resulted from binding of these inhibitors in the extracellular permeation pathway. However, the competitive nature of serotonin transport inhibition by antidepressants suggests that in neurotransmitter transporters, they bind in a site overlapping the substrate site.

==Human systems==

Horschitz et al. examined reuptake inhibitor selectivity among the rat serotonin reuptake protein (SERT) expressed in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-SERT). They presented SERT with varying doses of either citalopram (an SSRI) or desipramine (an inhibitor of norepinephrine reuptake protein, NET). By examining the dose-response curves (using a normal medium as control), they were able to quantify that citalopram acted on SERT as an SSRI, and that desipramine had no effect on SERT. In a separate experiment, Horschitz et al. exposed HEK-SERT with citalopram on a long-term basis. They noticed that long-term exposure led to a down-regulation of binding sites. These results suggest some mechanism for long-term changes in the pre-synaptic neuron after drug therapy. Horschitz et al. found that after removing citalopram from the system, normal levels of SERT binding site expression returned.

Depression has been suggested to be a result of a decrease of serotonin found in the synapse, although this hypothesis has been challenged since as early as the 1980s. It was initially supported by the successful reduction of depressive symptoms after administration of tricyclic antidepressants (such as desipramine) and SSRIs. Tricyclic antidepressants inhibit the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine by acting upon both the SERT and NET. SSRIs selectively inhibit the reuptake of serotonin by acting upon SERT. The net result is an increased amount of serotonin in the synapse, thus increasing the probability that serotonin will interact with a serotonin receptor of the postsynaptic neuron. There are additional mechanisms by which serotonin autoreceptor desensitization must occur, but the net result is the same. This increases serotonin signaling, which according to the hypothesis is believed to elevate mood and thus relieve depressive symptoms. This proposal for the antidepressant mechanism of serotonin reuptake inhibitors does not account for the time course of the therapeutic effect, which takes weeks to months, while transporter inhibition is essentially immediate.

The net effect of amphetamine (AMPH) use is an increase of dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin in the synapse. It has been shown that AMPH acts upon trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) to induce efflux and reuptake inhibition in the serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine transporters. This effect requires the transporter and TAAR1 to be co-localized (occur together) within the same neuron.

==Neuroprotective role==
Astrocytes seem to utilize reuptake mechanisms for a neuroprotective role. Astrocytes use excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2, aka GLT-1) to remove glutamate from the synapse. EAAT2 knockout mice were more prone to lethal and spontaneous seizures and acute brain injuries among the cortex. These effects could be linked to increased concentrations of glutamate in the brains of EAAT2 knockout mice, analyzed post-mortem.

<doc id="239887" wikidata="Q2516951" url="?curid=239887" title="Pricing">
<text>Pricing is the process whereby a business sets and displays the price at which it will sell its products and services and may be part of the business&#x27;s marketing plan. In setting prices, the business will take into account the price at which it could acquire the goods, the manufacturing cost, the marketplace, competition, market condition, brand, and quality of the product.

Pricing is a fundamental aspect of product management and is one of the four Ps of the marketing mix, the other three aspects being product, promotion, and place. Price is the only revenue generating element amongst the four Ps, the rest being cost centers. However, the other Ps of marketing will contribute to decreasing price elasticity and so enable price increases to drive greater revenue and profits.

Pricing can be a manual or automatic process of applying prices to purchase and sales orders, based on factors such as a fixed amount, quantity break, promotion or sales campaign, specific vendor quote, price prevailing on entry, shipment or invoice date, a combination of multiple orders or lines, and many others. An automated pricing system requires more setup and maintenance but may prevent pricing errors. The needs of the consumer can be converted into demand only if the consumer has the willingness and capacity to buy the product. Thus, pricing is the most important concept in the field of marketing, it is used as a tactical decision in response to changing competitive, market and organizational situations.

==Objectives of pricing==

The objectives of pricing should consider:
* the financial goals of the company (i.e. profitability)
* the fit with marketplace realities (will customers buy at that price?)
* the extent to which the price supports a product&#x27;s market positioning and be consistent with the other variables in the marketing mix
* the consistency of prices across categories and products (consistency indicates reliability and supports customer confidence and customer satisfaction)
* To meet or prevent competition

Price is influenced by the type of distribution channel used, the type of promotions used, and the quality of the product. Where manufacturing is expensive, distribution is exclusive, and the product is supported by extensive advertising and promotional campaigns, then prices are likely to be higher. Price can act as a substitute for product quality, effective promotions, or an energetic selling effort by distributors in certain markets.

From the marketer&#x27;s point of view, an efficient price is a price that is very close to the maximum that customers are prepared to pay. In economic terms, it is a price that shifts most of the consumer&#x27;s economic surplus to the producer. A good pricing strategy would be the one that could balance between the price floor (the price below which the organization ends up in losses) and the price ceiling (the price by which the organization experiences a no-demand situation).

==Pricing strategies==

Pricing is not always seen as a strategic process. Greg Cudahy of Accenture observed in 2007 that for some businesses, &quot;pricing is the last bastion of gut feel&quot;. Where pricing is strategic, marketers develop an overall pricing strategy which is consistent with the organization&#x27;s mission and values. This pricing strategy typically becomes part of the company&#x27;s overall long-term strategic plan. The strategy is designed to provide broad guidance for price-setters and ensures that the pricing strategy is consistent with other elements of the marketing plan. While the actual price of goods or services may vary in response to different conditions, the broad approach to pricing (i.e., the pricing strategy) remains a constant for the planning outlook period which is typically 3–5 years, but in some industries may be a longer period of 7–10 years. The pricing strategy established the overall, long-term goals of the pricing function, without specifying an actual price-point.

Broadly, there are six approaches to pricing strategy mentioned in the marketing literature:

: Operations-oriented pricing: where the objective is to optimize productive capacity, to achieve operational efficiencies or to match supply and demand through varying prices. In some cases, prices might be set to de-market.

: Revenue-oriented pricing: (also known as &quot;profit-oriented pricing&quot; or &quot;cost-based pricing&quot;) - where the marketer seeks to maximize the profits (i.e., the surplus income over costs) or simply to cover costs and break even. For example, dynamic pricing (also known as yield management) is a form of revenue oriented pricing.

: Customer-oriented pricing: where the objective is to maximize the number of customers; encourage cross-selling opportunities or to recognize different levels in the customer&#x27;s ability to pay.

: Value-based pricing: (also known as &quot;image-based pricing&quot;) occurs when the company uses prices to signal market value or associates price with the desired value position in the mind of the buyer. The aim of value-based pricing is to reinforce the overall positioning strategy, e.g., premium pricing posture to pursue or maintain a luxury image.

: Relationship-oriented pricing: where the marketer sets prices in order to build or maintain relationships with existing or potential customers.

: Socially-oriented pricing: Where the objective is to encourage or discourage specific social attitudes and behaviours. e.g. high tariffs on tobacco to discourage smoking.

: Optional pricing: Where the objective is to allow consumer to have an option on their purchase. e.g. buying a car optional to have CD player 

==Pricing tactics==

When decision-makers have determined the broad approach to pricing (i.e., the pricing strategy), they turn their attention to pricing tactics. Tactical pricing decisions are shorter term prices, designed to accomplish specific short-term goals. The tactical approach to pricing may vary from time to time, depending on a range of internal considerations (e.g. such as the need to clear surplus inventory) or external factors (e.g. a response to competitive pricing tactics). Accordingly, a number of different pricing tactics may be employed in the course of a single planning period or across a single year. Typically line managers are given the latitude necessary to vary individual prices providing that they operate within the broad strategic approach. For example, some premium brands never offer discounts because the use of low prices may tarnish the brand image. Instead of discounting, premium brands are more likely to offer customer value through price-bundling or giveaways.

When setting individual prices, decision-makers require a solid understanding of pricing economics, notably break-even analysis, as well as an appreciation of the psychological aspects of consumer decision-making including reservation prices, ceiling prices and floor prices. The marketing literature identifies literally hundreds of pricing tactics. It is difficult to do justice to the variety of tactics in widespread use. Rao and Kartono carried out a cross-cultural study to identify the pricing strategies and tactics that are most widely used. The following listing is largely based on their work.

===ARC/RRC pricing===
A traditional tactic used in outsourcing that uses a fixed fee for a fixed volume of services, with variations on fees for volumes above or below target thresholds. Charges for additional resources (&quot;ARCs&quot;) above the threshold are priced at rates to reflect the marginal cost of the additional production plus a reasonable profit. Credits (&quot;RRCs&quot;) granted for reduction in resources consumed or provided offer the enterprise customer some comfort, but the savings on credits tend not to be equivalent to the increased costs when paying for incremental resources in excess of the threshold.

===Complementary pricing===

Complementary pricing is an umbrella category of &quot;captive-market&quot; pricing tactics. It refers to a method in which one of two or more complementary products (a deskjet printer, for example) is priced to maximize sales volume, while the complementary product (printer ink cartridges) are priced at a much higher level in order to cover any shortfall sustained by the first product.

===Contingency pricing ===
Contingency pricing is the process where a fee is only charged contingent on certain results. Contingency pricing is widely used in professional services such as legal services and consultancy services. In the United Kingdom, a contingency fee is known as a conditional fee.

===Differential pricing ===

Differential pricing, also known as &quot;flexible pricing&quot;, &quot;multiple pricing&quot; or &quot;price discrimination&quot; , occurs where different prices are charged to different customers or market-segments, and may be dependent on the service provider&#x27;s assessment of the customer&#x27;s willingness or ability to pay. There are various forms of price difference including: the type of customer, the geographic area served, the quantity ordered, delivery time, payment terms, etc.

===Discrete pricing ===
Discrete Pricing occurs when prices are set at a level that the price comes within the competence of the decision making unit (DMU). This method of pricing is often used in B2B contexts where the purchasing officer may be authorized to make purchases up to a predetermined level, beyond which decisions must go to a committee for authorization. With the advent of data analytics differential price is becoming popular with most companies using customer specific data to give prices to specific customer.

===Discount pricing ===

Discount pricing is where the marketer or retailer offers a reduced price. Discounts in a variety of forms - e.g. quantity rebates, loyalty rebates, seasonal discounts, periodic or random discounts etc. Enormous retailers can request value limits from providers and make a rebate evaluating system powerful as they purchase in mass. It is normally difficult to rival these retailers dependent on a rebate estimating technique. This type of pricing strategy is a predominant showcasing procedure to draw in shoppers by providing an additional worth or motivator, which urges customers to buy the advanced items right away.

===Diversionary pricing ===
Diversionary Pricing is a variation of loss leading used extensively in services; a low price is charged on a basic service with the intention of recouping on the extras; can also refer to low prices on some parts of the service to develop an image of low price.

===Everyday low prices===

Everyday low prices refers to the practice of maintaining a regular low price - in which consumers are not forced to wait for discounting or specials. This method is used by supermarkets.

===Exit fees ===
Exit fees are fees charged to customers who depart from the service process prior to natural completion or the end of a contract. The objective of an exit fee is to deter premature exit. Exit fees are often found in financial services, telecommunications services and aged care facilities. Regulatory authorities, around the globe, have often expressed their discontent with the practice of exit fees as it has the potential to be anti-competitive and restricts consumers&#x27; abilities to switch freely, but the practice has not been proscribed.

===Experience curve pricing===
Experience curve pricing occurs when a manufacturer prices a product or service at a low rate in order to obtain volume and with the expectation that the cost of production will decrease with the acquisition of manufacturing experience. This approach, which is often used in the pricing of high technology products and services, is based on the insight that manufacturers learn to trim production costs over time in a phenomenon known as experience effects.

===Geographic pricing ===
Geographic pricing occurs when different prices are charged in different geographic markets for an identical product. For example, publishers often make text-books available at lower prices in Asian countries because average wages tend to be lower with implications for the customer&#x27;s ability to pay. In other cases, geographic variations in prices may reflect the different costs of distribution and servicing certain markets.

===Guaranteed pricing ===
Guaranteed pricing is a variant of contingency pricing. It refers to the practice of including an undertaking or promise that certain results or outcomes will be achieved. For instance, some business consultants undertake to improve productivity or profitability by 10%. In the event that the result is not achieved, the client does not pay for the service.

=== High-low pricing===
High-low pricing refers to the practice of offering goods at a high price for a period of time, followed by offering the same goods at a low price for a predetermined time. This practice is widely used by chain stores selling homewares. The main disadvantage of the high-low tactic is that consumers tend to become aware of the price cycles and time their purchases to coincide with a low-price cycle.

===Honeymoon pricing ===
Honeymoon Pricing refers to the practice of using a low introductory price with subsequent price increases once relationship is established. The objective of honeymoon pricing is to &quot;lock&quot; customers into a long-term association with the vendor. This approach is widely used in situations where customer switching costs are relatively high such as in home loans and financial investments. It is also common in categories where a subscription model is used, especially if this is coupled with automatic regular payments, such as in newspaper and magazine subscriptions, cable TV, broadband and cell phone subscriptions and in utilities and insurance.

===Loss leader===
A loss leader is a product that has a price set below the operating margin. Loss leading is widely used in supermarkets and budget-priced retail outlets where the store as a means of generating store traffic. The low price is widely promoted and the store is prepared to take a small loss on an individual item, with an expectation that it will recoup that loss when customers purchase other higher priced-higher margin items. In service industries, loss leading may refer to the practice of charging a reduced price on the first order as an inducement and with anticipation of charging higher prices on subsequent orders. Loss leading is often found in retail, where the loss leader is used to drive store traffic and generate sales of complementary items.

===Offset pricing===
Offset pricing (also known as &quot;diversionary pricing&quot;) is the service industry&#x27;s equivalent of loss leading. A service may price one component of the offer at a very low price with an expectation that it can recoup any losses by cross-selling additional services. For example, a carpet steam cleaning service may charge a very low basic price for the first three rooms, but charges higher prices for additional rooms, furniture and curtain cleaning. The operator may also try to cross-sell the client on additional services such as spot-cleaning products, or stain-resistant treatments for fabrics and carpets.

===Parity pricing===
Parity pricing refers to the process of pricing a product at or near a rival&#x27;s price in order to remain competitive. Markets can be sectioned empowering the firm to segregate between the fare and homegrown market it is indicated that the defectively serious firm can differentially cost. Besides, as the quantity of homegrown firms is expanded, and if these organizations can portion the market, the differential among homegrown and unfamiliar costs is diminished. The import equality cost might be charged in the homegrown market.

===Price bundling===

Price bundling (also known as product bundling) occurs where two or more products or services are priced as a package with a single price. There are several types of bundles: &quot;pure bundles&quot; where the goods can only be purchased as package or &quot;mixed bundles&quot; where the goods can be purchased individually or as a package. The prices of the bundle is typically less than when the two items are purchased separately.

===Peak and off-peak pricing===
Peak and off-peak pricing is a form of price discrimination where the price variation is due to some type of seasonal factor. The objective of peak and off peak pricing is to use prices to even out peaks and troughs in demand. Peak and off-peak pricing is widely used in tourism, travel and also in utilities such as electricity providers. Peak pricing has caught the public&#x27;s imagination since the ride-sharing service provider, Uber, commenced using &quot;surge pricing&quot; and has sought to patent the technologies that support this approach.

===Price discrimination===
Price discrimination is also known as variable pricing or &quot;differential pricing&quot;.

===Price lining===
&quot;Price lining&quot; is the use of a limited number of prices for all product offered by a business. Price lining is a tradition started in the old five and dime stores in which everything cost either 5 or 10 cents. In price lining, the price remains constant but quality or extent of product or service adjusted to reflect changes in cost. The underlying rationale of this tactic is that these amounts are seen as suitable price points for a whole range of products by prospective customers. It has the advantage of ease of administering, but the disadvantage of inflexibility, particularly in times of inflation or unstable prices. Price lining continues to be widely used in department stores where customers often note racks of garments or accessories priced at predetermined price points e.g. separate racks of men&#x27;s ties, where each rack is priced at $10, $20 and $40.

===Penetration pricing ===
Penetration pricing is an approach that can be considered at the time of market entry. In this approach, the price of a product is initially set low in an effort to penetrate the market quickly. Low prices and low margins also act as a deterrent, preventing potential rivals from entering the market since they would have to undercut the low margins to gain a foothold.

===Prestige pricing===
Prestige pricing is also known as &quot;premium pricing&quot; and occasionally &quot;luxury pricing&quot; or &quot;high price maintenance&quot; refers to the deliberate pursuit of a high price posture to create an image of quality.

===Price signaling ===
Price signaling is where the price is used as an indicator of some other attribute. For example, some travel resorts promote that when two adults make a booking, the kids stay for free. This type of pricing is designed to signal that the resort is a family friendly operation.

===Price skimming ===
Price skimming, also known as &quot;skim-the-cream pricing&quot; is a tactic that might be considered at market entry. The objective is to charge relatively high prices in order to recoup the cost of product development early in the life-cycle and before competitors enter the market.

===Promotional pricing===
Promotional pricing is a temporary measure that involves setting prices at levels lower than normally charged for a good or service. Promotional pricing is sometimes a reaction to unforeseen circumstances, as when a downturn in demand leaves a company with excess stocks; or when competitive activity is making inroads into market share or profits.

===Two-part pricing ===
Two-part pricing is a variant of captive-market pricing used in service industries. Two-part pricing breaks the actual price into two parts; a fixed service fee plus a variable consumption rate. Two-part pricing tactics are widely used by utility companies such as electricity, gas and water and services where there is a quasi- membership type relationship, credit cards where an annual fee is charged and theme parks where an entrance fee is charged for admission while the customer pays for rides and extras. One part of the price represents a membership fee or joining fee, while the second part represents the usage component.

===Psychological pricing===
Psychological pricing is a range of tactics designed to have a positive psychological impact. Price tags using the terminal digit &quot;9&quot;, ($9.99, $19.99 or $199.99) can be used to signal price points and bring an item in at just under the consumer&#x27;s reservation price. Psychological pricing is widely used in a variety of retail settings.

===Premium pricing===
&quot;Premium pricing&quot; (also called prestige pricing) is the strategy of consistently pricing at, or near, the high end of the possible price range to help attract status-conscious consumers. The high pricing of a premium product is used to enhance and reinforce a product&#x27;s luxury image. Examples of companies that partake in premium pricing in the marketplace include Rolex and Bentley. As well as brand, product attributes such as eco-labelling and provenance (e.g. &#x27;certified organic&#x27; and &#x27;product of Australia&#x27;) may add value for consumers and attract premium pricing. A component of such premiums may reflect the increased cost of production. People will buy a premium priced product because:
* They believe the high price is an indication of good quality
* They believe it to be a sign of self-worth - &quot;They are worth it;&quot; it authenticates the buyer&#x27;s success and status; it is a signal to others that the owner is a member of an exclusive group
* They require flawless performance in this application - the cost of product malfunction is too high to buy anything but the best - for example, a heart pacemaker.
The old association of luxury only being for the kings and queens of the world is almost non-existent in today&#x27;s world. People have generally become wealthier, therefore the mass marketing phenomenon of luxury has simply become a part of everyday life, and no longer reserved for the elite. Since consumers have a larger source of disposable income, they now have the power to purchase products that meet their aspirational needs. This phenomenon enables premium pricing opportunities for marketers in luxury markets. Luxurification in society can be seen when middle class members of society, are willing to pay premium prices for a service or product of the highest quality when compared with similar goods. Examples of this can be seen with items such as clothing and electronics. Charging a premium price for a product also makes it more inaccessible and helps it gain an exclusive appeal. Luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton and Gucci are more than just clothing and become more of a status symbol. (Yeoman, 2011).

Prestige goods are usually sold by companies that have a monopoly on the market and hold competitive advantage. Due to a firm having great market power they are able to charge at a premium for goods, and are able to spend a larger sum on promotion and advertising. According to Han, Nunes and Dreze (2015) figure on &quot;signal preference and taxonomy based on wealth and need for status&quot; two social groups known as &quot;Parvenus&quot; and &quot;Poseurs&quot; are individuals generally more self-conscious, and base purchases on a need to reach a higher status or gain a social prestige value. Further market research shows the role of possessions in consumer&#x27;s lives and how people make assumptions about others solely based on their possessions. People associate high priced items with success. (Han et al., 2010). Marketers understand this concept, and price items at a premium to create the illusion of exclusivity and high quality. Consumers are likely to purchase a product at a higher price than a similar product as they crave the status, and feeling of superiority as being part of a minority that can in fact afford the said product. (Han et al., 2010).

A price premium can also be charged to consumers when purchasing eco-labelled products. Market based incentives are given in order to encourage people to practice their business in an eco-friendly way in regard to the environment. Associations such as the MSC&#x27;s fishery certification program and seafood ecolabel reward those who practice sustainable fishing. Pressure from environmental groups have caused the implementation of Associations such as these, rather than consumers demanding it. The value consumer&#x27;s gain from purchasing environmentally conscious products may create a premium price over non eco-labelled products. This means that producers have some sort of incentive for supplying goods worthy of eco-labelling standard. Usually more costs are incurred when practicing sustainable business, and charging at a premium is a way businesses can recover extra costs.

===Competitive pricing===
Competitive pricing is a pricing tactic used by companies to set prices for their products or services based on the prices charged by their competitors. This pricing strategy involves closely monitoring the prices charged by competitors, and adjusting prices accordingly to remain competitive in the market. Companies may use a variety of pricing tactics to achieve this. Competitive pricing is not always the best pricing strategy for every company or market.

===Bundle pricing===
Bundle pricing is a pricing tactic in which multiple products or services are offered together as a package, at a discounted price. Bundle pricing can take various forms. It is important for businesses to carefully consider the products or services included in a bundle, as well as the price point of the bundle, to ensure that it is profitable for the company.

===Price discrimination===
Price discrimination is a pricing tactic where businesses charge different prices for the same product or service based on different customer groups. This tactic is used to maximize profits by charging customers the highest price they are willing to pay. Price discrimination can take various forms, such as charging different prices for the same product or service at different locations, offering discounts or promotions to certain groups of customers, or using dynamic pricing to adjust prices in real-time based on customer behavior or market conditions.

==Methods of setting prices==

Pricing factors include manufacturing cost, market place, competition, market condition, and the quality of product.

===Demand-based pricing===
&quot;Demand-based pricing&quot;, also known as dynamic pricing or yield management, is a pricing method that uses consumer demand – based on perceived value – as the central element. It is fundamentally a type of rationing: as shortages cause the price to rise, either demand weakens (as the price becomes too high to attract as many buyers) or the supply increases (as high profits encourage new suppliers to enter the market). 

Price modeling using econometric techniques can help measure price elasticity, and computer based modeling tools will often facilitate simulations of different prices and the outcome on sales and profit. More sophisticated tools help determine price at the SKU level across a portfolio of products. Retailers will optimize the price of their private label SKUs with those of national brands.

Uber&#x27;s pricing policy is an example of short-term demand-based dynamic pricing. It uses an automated algorithm to increase prices to &quot;surge price&quot; levels, responding rapidly to changes of supply and demand in the market. By responding in real-time, an equilibrium between demand and supply of drivers can be approached. Customers receive notice when making an Uber reservation that prices have increased. The company applied for a U.S. patent on surge pricing in 2013, though airlines are known to have been using similar techniques in seat pricing for years.

The practice has often caused passengers to become upset and invited criticism when it happens as a result of holidays, inclement weather, natural disasters, or other factors. During New Year&#x27;s Eve 2011, Uber prices were as high as seven times normal rates, causing outrage. During the 2014 Sydney hostage crisis, Uber implemented surge pricing, resulting in fares of up to four times normal charges; while it defended the surge pricing at first, it later apologized and refunded the surcharges. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has responded to criticism by saying: &quot;...because this is so new, it&#x27;s going to take some time for folks to accept it. There&#x27;s 70 years of conditioning around the fixed price of taxis.&quot;

Demand-based pricing is perceived by buyers as unfair, and during emergencies or other difficulties, as a type of price gouging. For example, rather than seeing the increased cost of an Uber ride on a holiday as a way of encouraging more drivers to work that day instead of celebrating the holiday themselves, through the mechanism of paying the drivers more to work during peak hours, or as a way of encouraging would-be buyers to reduce demand by using alternatives like carpooling or mass transit, the buyers see it as the company exploiting their increased need for services on holidays. 

===Multidimensional pricing===
&quot;Multidimensional pricing&quot; is the pricing of a product or service using multiple numbers. In this practice, price no longer consists of a single monetary amount (e.g., sticker price of a car), but rather consists of various dimensions (e.g., monthly payments, number of payments, and a downpayment). Research has shown that this practice can significantly influence consumers&#x27; ability to understand and process price information.

=== Personalized pricing ===

Personalized pricing uses information about the would-be buyers to offer different prices to different buyers, based on what the seller knows about the buyer. In principle, this would offer lower prices to customers who are price-sensitive or who are unlikely to buy the product or service, and higher prices to customers who are more able or willing to pay higher prices. This may be calculated from aggregated customer data (e.g., indicating that buyers from a high-income city will pay higher prices) or, during an individual negotiation, based on the seller&#x27;s beliefs about how much the buyer is willing to pay.

Student financial aid in the United States is an example of personalized pricing, as universities offer different amounts and types of discounts and loan options to different students based on what the school knows about the student&#x27;s family and income.

===Micromarketing===
Micromarketing is the practice of tailoring products, brands (microbrands), and promotions to meet the needs and wants of microsegments within a market. It is a type of market customization that deals with pricing of customer/product combinations at the store or individual level.

==Theoretical considerations in pricing==

===Price/quality relationship===
The &quot;price/quality relationship&quot; comprises consumers&#x27; perceptions of value. High prices are often taken as a sign of quality, especially when the product or service lacks search qualities that can be inspected prior to purchase. Understanding consumers’ perceptions of the price/quality relationship is most important in the case of complex products that are hard to test, and experiential products that cannot be tested until used (such as most services). The greater the uncertainty surrounding a product, the more consumers depend on the price/quality signal and the greater premium they may be prepared to pay.

Consumers can have different perceptions on premium pricing, and this factor makes it important for the marketer to understand consumer behaviour. According to Vigneron and Johnson&#x27;s figure on &quot;Prestige-Seeking Consumer Behaviours&quot;, Consumers can be categorized into four groups. These groups being; Hedonist &amp; Perfectionist, snob, bandwagon and veblenian. These categories rank from level of self-consciousness, to importance of price as an indicator of prestige. The Veblen Effect explains how this group of consumers makes purchase decisions based on conspicuous value, as they tend to purchase publicly consumed luxury products. This shows they are likely to make the purchase to show power, status and wealth. Consumers that fall under the &quot;Snob Effect&quot; can be described as individuals that search for perceived unique value, and will purchase exclusive products in order to be the first or very few who has it. They will also avoid purchasing products consumed by a general mass of people, as it is perceived that items in limited supply hold a higher value than items that do not. (Vigneron &amp; Johnson, 1999). The bandwagon effect explains that consumers that fit into this category make purchasing decisions to fit into a social group, and gain a perceived social value out of purchasing popular products within said social group at premium prices. Research shows that people will often conform to what the majority of the group they are a member of thinks when it comes to the attitude of a product. Paying a premium price for a product can act as a way of gaining acceptance, due to the pressure placed on them by their peers. The Hedonic effect can be described as a certain group of people whose purchasing decisions are not affected by the status and exclusivity gained by purchasing a product at a premium, nor susceptible to the fear of being left out and peer pressure. Consumers who fit into this category base their purchasing decisions on a perceived emotional value, and gain intangible benefits such as sensory pleasure, aesthetic beauty and excitement. Consumers of this type have a higher interest on their own wellbeing. (Vigneron &amp; Johnson, 1999). The last category on Vigneron and Johnson&#x27;s figure of &quot;Prestige-Seeking Consumer Behaviours&quot; is the perfectionism effect. Prestige brands are expected to show high quality, and it is this reassurance of the highest quality that can actually enhance the value of the product. According to this effect, those that fit into this group value the prestige&#x27;s brands to have a superior quality and higher performance than other similar brands. Research has indicated that consumer&#x27;s perceive quality of a product to be relational to its price. Consumers often believe a high price of a product indicates a higher level of quality.

Even though it is suggested that high prices seem to make certain products more desirable, consumers that fall in this category have their own perception of quality and make decisions based upon their own judgement. They may also use the premium price as an indicator of the product&#x27;s level of quality.

===Price sensitivity and consumer psychology===

In their book, &quot;The Strategy and Tactics of Pricing&quot;, Thomas Nagle and Reed Holden outline nine laws or factors that influence how a consumer perceives a given price and how price-sensitive s/he is likely to be with respect to different purchase decisions:

* Reference price effect: Buyer&#x27;s price sensitivity for a given product increases the higher the product&#x27;s price relative to perceived alternatives. Perceived alternatives can vary by buyer segment, by occasion, and other factors.
* Difficult comparison effect Buyers are less sensitive to the price of a known / more reputable product when they have difficulty comparing it to potential alternatives.
* Switching costs effect: The higher the product-specific investment a buyer must make to switch suppliers, the less price sensitive that buyer is when choosing between alternatives.
*:High switching costs: Organizations that produce that have scarcely any substitutes and require huge exertion to ace their utilization appreciate huge exchanging costs. Some firms has additionally fused membership deals, which add greater consistency to its plan of action and further secure their clients. Similarly as with numerous innovation organizations, vulnerability remains in regards to its new item improvement cycle and reception of new items.
*:Low switching costs: Organizations that offer items or administrations that are exceptionally simple to imitate at equivalent costs by contenders regularly have low exchanging costs. For example, clothing company have restricted exchanging costs among customers, who can discover garments bargains effectively and can rapidly think about costs by strolling starting with one store then onto the next. The ascent of Internet retailers and quick transportation has made it significantly simpler for customers to search for attire at their homes over numerous online stages.
* Price-quality effect: Buyers are less sensitive to price the more that higher prices signal higher quality. Products for which this effect is particularly relevant include: image products, exclusive products, and products with minimal cues for quality.
* Expenditure effect: Buyers are more price sensitive when the expense accounts for a large percentage of buyers’ available income or budget.
* End-benefit effect: The effect refers to the relationship a given purchase has to a larger overall benefit, and is divided into two parts:
*:Derived demand: The more sensitive buyers are to the price of the end benefit, the more sensitive they will be to the prices of those products that contribute to that benefit. 
*:Price proportion cost: The price proportion cost refers to the percent of the total cost of the end benefit accounted for by a given component that helps to produce the end benefit (e.g., think CPU and PCs). The smaller the given components share of the total cost of the end benefit, the less sensitive buyers will be to the component&#x27;s price.
* Shared-cost effect: The smaller the portion of the purchase price buyers must pay for themselves, the less price sensitive they will be.
* Fairness effect: Buyers are more sensitive to the price of a product when the price is outside the range they perceive as &quot;fair&quot; or &quot;reasonable&quot; given the purchase context.
* Framing effect: Buyers are more price sensitive when they perceive the price as a loss rather than a forgone gain, and they have greater price sensitivity when the price is paid separately rather than as part of a bundle.

==Approaches==
Pricing is the most effective profit lever.
Pricing can be approached at three levels: the industry, market, and transaction level.

* Pricing at the industry level focuses on the overall economics of the industry, including supplier price changes and customer demand changes.
* Pricing at the market level focuses on the competitive position of the price in comparison to the value differential of the product to that of comparative competing products.
* Pricing at the transaction level focuses on managing the implementation of discounts away from the reference, or list price, which occur both on and off the invoice or receipt.

A &quot;price waterfall&quot; analysis helps businesses and sales personnel to understand the differences which arise between the reference or list price, the invoiced sale price and the actual price paid by a customer taking account of contract, sales and payment discounts.

==Pricing display==

Pricing display refers to the manner in which current and previous prices are made known to customers, for example through labels on products or shelving or in promotional material. UK government guidance on food pricing display was adopted in 2012 by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) and later endorsed by the Competition and Markets Authority (who replaced the OFT). The guidance includes examples of good practice to be followed where a retailer wishes to draw attention both to a current price and the fact that the product was previously sold at a higher price.

==Pricing mistakes ==
Many companies make common pricing mistakes. Jerry Bernstein&#x27;s article &quot;Use Suppliers&#x27; Pricing Mistakes&quot; outlines several sales errors, which include:
* Weak controls on discounting (price override)
* Inadequate systems for tracking competitors&#x27; selling prices and market share (Competitive intelligence)
* Cost-plus pricing
* Price increases poorly executed
* Worldwide price inconsistencies
* Paying sales representatives on sales volume vs. addition of revenue measures

Contrary to common misconception, price is not the most important factor for consumers, when deciding to buy a product.

<text>A cleft lip contains an opening in the upper lip that may extend into the nose. The opening may be on one side, both sides, or in the middle. A cleft palate occurs when the palate (the roof of the mouth) contains an opening into the nose. The term orofacial cleft refers to either condition or to both occurring together. These disorders can result in feeding problems, speech problems, hearing problems, and frequent ear infections. Less than half the time the condition is associated with other disorders.
Cleft lip and palate are the result of tissues of the face not joining properly during development. As such, they are a type of birth defect. The cause is unknown in most cases. Risk factors include smoking during pregnancy, diabetes, obesity, an older mother, and certain medications (such as some used to treat seizures). Cleft lip and cleft palate can often be diagnosed during pregnancy with an ultrasound exam.
A cleft lip or palate can be successfully treated with surgery. This is often done in the first few months of life for cleft lip and before eighteen months for cleft palate. Speech therapy and dental care may also be needed. With appropriate treatment, outcomes are good.
Cleft lip and palate occurs in about 1 to 2 per 1000 births in the developed world. Cleft lip is about twice as common in males as females, while cleft palate without cleft lip is more common in females. In 2017, it resulted in about 3,800 deaths globally, down from 14,600 deaths in 1990. Cleft lips are commonly known as hare-lips because of their resemblance to the lips of hares or rabbits.
==Signs and symptoms==

=== Cleft lip ===
If the cleft does not affect the palate structure of the mouth, it is referred to as cleft lip. Cleft lip is formed in the top of the lip as either a small gap or an indentation in the lip (partial or incomplete cleft), or it continues into the nose (complete cleft). Lip cleft can occur as a one-sided (unilateral) or two-sided (bilateral) condition. It is due to the failure of fusion of the maxillary prominence and medial nasal processes (formation of the primary palate).

A mild form of a cleft lip is a microform cleft. A microform cleft can appear as small as a little dent in the red part of the lip or look like a scar from the lip up to the nostril. In some cases muscle tissue in the lip underneath the scar is affected and might require reconstructive surgery. It is advised to have newborn infants with a microform cleft checked with a craniofacial team as soon as possible to determine the severity of the cleft.

===Cleft palate===
Cleft palate is a condition in which the two plates of the skull that form the hard palate (roof of the mouth) are not completely joined. The soft palate is in these cases cleft as well. In most cases, cleft lip is also present.

Palate cleft can occur as complete (soft and hard palate, possibly including a gap in the jaw) or incomplete (a &#x27;hole&#x27; in the roof of the mouth, usually as a cleft soft palate). When cleft palate occurs, the uvula is usually split. It occurs due to the failure of fusion of the lateral palatine processes, the nasal septum, or the median palatine processes (formation of the secondary palate).

The hole in the roof of the mouth caused by a cleft connects the mouth directly to the inside of the nose.

Note: the next images show the roof of the mouth. The top shows the nose, the lips are colored pink. For clarity the images depict a toothless infant.

A result of an open connection between the mouth and inside the nose is called velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI). Because of the gap, air leaks into the nasal cavity resulting in a hypernasal voice resonance and nasal emissions while talking. Secondary effects of VPI include speech articulation errors (e.g., distortions, substitutions, and omissions) and compensatory misarticulations and mispronunciations (e.g., glottal stops and posterior nasal fricatives). Possible treatment options include speech therapy, prosthetics, augmentation of the posterior pharyngeal wall, lengthening of the palate, and surgical procedures.

Submucous cleft palate can also occur, which is a cleft of the soft palate with a split uvula, a furrow along the midline of the soft palate, and a notch in the back margin of the hard palate. The diagnosis of submucous cleft palate often occurs late in children as a result of the nature of the cleft. While the muscles of the soft palate are not joined, the mucosal membranes covering the roof of the mouth appear relatively normal and intact.

=== Teeth ===
Tooth development can be delayed with increasing severity of CLP. Some of the dental problems affect the primary teeth, but most of the problems arise after the permanent teeth erupt. Problems may include fused teeth, missing teeth, and extra teeth erupting behind normal teeth. Missing teeth or extra teeth are both normal occurrences. Typically, the lateral incisors are missing. The enamel (outermost layer of the tooth) is commonly found to be hypomineralized and hypoplastic, making the teeth more likely to decay. As CLP can make oral hygiene more difficult, there is an increased rate of cavities. In addition, abnormal positioning of individual teeth may affect occlusion, which can create an open bite or cross bite. This in turn can then affect the patient&#x27;s speech.

===Complications===

Cleft may cause problems with feeding, ear disease, speech, socialization, and cognition.

Due to lack of suction, an infant with a cleft may have trouble feeding. An infant with a cleft palate will have greater success feeding in a more upright position. Gravity will help prevent milk from coming through the baby&#x27;s nose if he/she has cleft palate. Gravity feeding can be accomplished by using specialized equipment, such as the Haberman Feeder. Another equipment commonly used for gravity feeding is a customized bottle with a combination of nipples and bottle inserts. A large hole, crosscut, or slit in the nipple, a protruding nipple and rhythmically squeezing the bottle insert can result in controllable flow to the infant without the stigma caused by specialized equipment.

Individuals with cleft also face many middle ear infections which may eventually lead to hearing loss. The Eustachian tubes and external ear canals may be angled or tortuous, leading to food or other contamination of a part of the body that is normally self-cleaning. Hearing is related to learning to speak. Babies with palatal clefts may have compromised hearing and therefore, if the baby cannot hear, it cannot try to mimic the sounds of speech. Thus, even before expressive language acquisition, the baby with the cleft palate is at risk for receptive language acquisition. Because the lips and palate are both used in pronunciation, individuals with cleft usually need the aid of a speech therapist.

Tentative evidence has found that those with clefts perform less well at language.

===Psychosocial issues===
There is research dedicated to the psychosocial development of individuals with cleft palate. A cleft palate/lip may impact an individual&#x27;s self-esteem, social skills and behavior. Self-concept may be adversely affected by the presence of a cleft lip or cleft palate, particularly among girls. Negative outcomes can also be associated with the long durations of hospitalization. Psychological issues could extend not just to the individual with CLP but also to their families, particularly their mothers, that experience varying levels of depression and anxiety.

Research has shown that during the early preschool years (ages 3–5), children with cleft lip or cleft palate tend to have a self-concept that is similar to their peers without a cleft. However, as they grow older and their social interactions increase, children with clefts tend to report more dissatisfaction with peer relationships and higher levels of social anxiety. Experts conclude that this is probably due to the associated stigma of visible deformities and possible speech impediments. Children who are judged as attractive tend to be perceived as more intelligent, exhibit more positive social behaviors, and are treated more positively than children with cleft lip or cleft palate. Children with clefts tend to report feelings of anger, sadness, fear, and alienation from their peers, but these children were similar to their peers in regard to &quot;how well they liked themselves.&quot;

The relationship between parental attitudes and a child&#x27;s self-concept is crucial during the preschool years. It has been reported that elevated stress levels in mothers correlated with reduced social skills in their children. Strong parent support networks may help to prevent the development of negative self-concept in children with cleft palate. In the later preschool and early elementary years, the development of social skills is no longer only impacted by parental attitudes but is beginning to be shaped by their peers. A cleft lip or cleft palate may affect the behavior of preschoolers. Experts suggest that parents discuss with their children ways to handle negative social situations related to their cleft lip or cleft palate. A child who is entering school should learn the proper (and age-appropriate) terms related to the cleft. The ability to confidently explain the condition to others may limit feelings of awkwardness and embarrassment and reduce negative social experiences.

As children reach adolescence, the period of time between age 13 and 19, the dynamics of the parent-child relationship change as peer groups are now the focus of attention. An adolescent with cleft lip or cleft palate will deal with the typical challenges faced by most of their peers including issues related to self-esteem, dating and social acceptance. Adolescents, however, view appearance as the most important characteristic, above intelligence and humor. This being the case, adolescents are susceptible to additional problems because they cannot hide their facial differences from their peers. Adolescent boys typically deal with issues relating to withdrawal, attention, thought, and internalizing problems, and may possibly develop anxiousness-depression and aggressive behaviors. Adolescent girls are more likely to develop problems relating to self-concept and appearance. Individuals with cleft lip or cleft palate often deal with threats to their quality of life for multiple reasons including unsuccessful social relationships, deviance in social appearance, and multiple surgeries.

==Cause==
Most clefts are polygenic and multifactorial in origin with many genetic and environmental factors contributing. Genetic factors cause clefts in 20% to 50% of the cases and the remaining clefts are attributable to either environmental factors (such as teratogens) or gene-environment interactions. The polygenic/multifactorial inheritance model predicts that most individuals will be born without clefts; however with a number of genetic or environmental factors, it can result in cleft formation.

The development of the face is coordinated by complex morphogenetic events and rapid proliferative expansion, and is thus highly susceptible to environmental and genetic factors, rationalising the high incidence of facial malformations. During the first six to eight weeks of pregnancy, the shape of the embryo&#x27;s head is formed. Five primitive tissue lobes grow:
If these tissues fail to meet, a gap appears where the tissues should have joined (fused). This may happen in any single joining site, or simultaneously in several or all of them. The resulting birth defect reflects the locations and severity of individual fusion failures (e.g., from a small lip or palate fissure up to a completely malformed face).

The upper lip is formed earlier than the palate, from the first three lobes named a to c above. Formation of the palate is the last step in joining the five embryonic facial lobes, and involves the back portions of the lobes b and c. These back portions are called palatal shelves, which grow towards each other until they fuse in the middle. This process is very vulnerable to multiple toxic substances, environmental pollutants, and nutritional imbalance. The biologic mechanisms of mutual recognition of the two cabinets, and the way they are glued together, are quite complex and obscure despite intensive scientific research.

Orofacial clefts may be associated with a syndrome (syndromic) or may not be associated with a syndrome (nonsyndromic). Syndromic clefts are part of syndromes that are caused by a variety of factors such as environment and genetics or an unknown cause. Nonsyndromic clefts, which are not as common as syndromic clefts, also have a genetic cause.

===Genetics===
Genetic factors contributing to cleft lip and cleft palate formation have been identified for some syndromic cases. Many clefts run in families, even though in some cases there does not seem to be an identifiable syndrome present. A number of genes are involved including cleft lip and palate transmembrane protein 1 and GAD1, One study found an association between mutations in the HYAL2 gene and cleft lip and cleft palate formation.

====Syndromes====
* The Van der Woude syndrome is caused by a specific variation in the gene &quot;IRF6&quot; that increases the occurrence of these deformities threefold. Mutations in interferon regulatory factor 6 (IRF6) that cause cleft lip palate are also implicated in neural tube defects such as spina bifida.
* Another syndrome, Siderius X-linked intellectual disability, is caused by mutations in the &quot;PHF8&quot; gene (); in addition to cleft lip or palate, symptoms include facial dysmorphism and mild intellectual disability.

In some cases, cleft palate is caused by syndromes that also cause other problems:
* Stickler syndrome can cause cleft lip and palate, joint pain, and myopia.
* Loeys–Dietz syndrome can cause cleft palate or bifid uvula, hypertelorism, and aortic aneurysm.
* Hardikar syndrome can cause cleft lip and palate, Hydronephrosis, Intestinal obstruction and other symptoms.
* Cleft lip/palate may be present in many different chromosome disorders including Patau syndrome (trisomy 13).
* Malpuech facial clefting syndrome
* Hearing loss with craniofacial syndromes
* Popliteal pterygium syndrome
* Cornelia de Lange syndrome
* Treacher Collins syndrome
* Pierre Robin syndrome

====Specific genes====
Many genes associated with syndromic cases of cleft lip/palate (see above) have been identified to contribute to the incidence of isolated cases of cleft lip/palate. This includes in particular sequence variants in the genes &quot;IRF6&quot;, &quot;PVRL1&quot; and &quot;MSX1&quot;. The understanding of the genetic complexities involved in the morphogenesis of the midface, including molecular and cellular processes, has been greatly aided by research on animal models, including of the genes &quot;BMP4&quot;, &quot;SHH&quot;, &quot;SHOX2&quot;, &quot;FGF10&quot; and &quot;MSX1&quot;.

===Environmental factors===
Environmental influences may also cause, or interact with genetics to produce, orofacial clefts. An example of the link between environmental factors and genetics comes from a research on mutations in the gene &quot;PHF8&quot;. The research found that &quot;PHF8&quot; encodes for a histone lysine demethylase, and is involved in epigenetic regulation. The catalytic activity of &quot;PHF8&quot; depends on molecular oxygen, a factor considered important from reports on increased incidence of cleft lip/palate in mice that have been exposed to hypoxia early during pregnancy.

Cleft lip and other congenital abnormalities have also been linked to maternal hypoxia caused by maternal smoking, with the estimated attributable fraction of orofacial clefts due to smoking in early pregnancy being 6.1%. Orofacial clefts occur very early in pregnancy and so smoking cessation right after recognition of pregnancy is unlikely to reduce the exposure during the critical time period.

Maternal alcohol use has also been linked to cleft lip and palate due to the effects on the cranial neural crest cells. The degree of the effect, however, is unknown and requires further research. Some forms of maternal hypertension treatment have been linked to cleft lip and palate. Other environmental factors that have been studied include seasonal causes (such as pesticide exposure); maternal diet and vitamin intake; retinoids (members of the vitamin A family); anticonvulsant drugs; nitrate compounds; organic solvents; parental exposure to lead; alcohol; cigarette use; and a number of other psychoactive drugs (e.g. cocaine, crack cocaine, heroin).

Current research continues to investigate the extent to which folic acid can reduce the incidence of clefting. Folic acid alone or in combination with vitamins and minerals prevents neural tube defects but does not have a clear effect on cleft lip palate incidence. The mechanism behind beneficial folate supplementation is due to folate playing a pivotal role in DNA synthesis and methylation and contributes to both development and gene expression.

==Diagnosis==
Traditionally, the diagnosis is made at the time of birth by physical examination. Recent advances in prenatal diagnosis have allowed obstetricians to diagnose facial clefts in utero with ultrasonography.

Clefts can also affect other parts of the face, such as the eyes, ears, nose, cheeks, and forehead. In 1976, Paul Tessier described fifteen lines of cleft. Most of these craniofacial clefts are even rarer and are frequently described as Tessier clefts using the numerical locator devised by Tessier.

===Classification===
Cleft lip and cleft palate is an &quot;umbrella term&quot; for a collection of orofacial clefts. It includes clefting of the upper lip, the maxillary alveolus (dental arch), and the hard or soft palate, in various combinations. Proposed anatomic combinations include:
* cleft lip
* cleft lip and alveolus
* cleft lip, alveolus, and palate
* cleft lip and palate (with an intact alveolus)
* cleft palate

=== Prenatal diagnosis ===
Cleft lip with or without palate is classified as the most common congenital birth defect. It has been noted that the prevalence of orofacial clefts varies by race. The highest number of cases have been recorded among Asians and Native Americans, followed by Europeans, Hispanics and African-Americans. The critical period for cleft development ranges from the 4th to the 12th week of intrauterine life. Clefts of the primary palate develop between the 4th and 7th weeks of intrauterine life, while clefts of the secondary palate develop between the 8th and 12th embryonic weeks.

Accurate evaluation of craniofacial malformations is usually possible with the ultrasound scan performed during pregnancy. This is however not a routine procedure according to the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine. The accuracy of ultrasonography for prenatal diagnosis of cleft lip +/- palate is dependent on the experience of the sonologist, maternal body type, foetal position, the amount of amniotic fluid and the type of cleft.

Prenatal diagnosis enables appropriate and timely education and discussion with parents by the cleft team. This helps improve the quality of treatment received by the child and improves quality of life.

An accurate prenatal diagnosis of the CLP anomaly is critical for establishing long-term treatment planning, prediction of treatment outcome, and discussion and education of the parent. Although there is no intrauterine treatment for CLP, both mother and child benefit from early diagnosis and education. A multidisciplinary team approach is now accepted as the standard of care in dealing with CLP patients.

The time period immediately after the diagnosis and the first year after the birth is most challenging for parents. A systematically planned treatment plan and support system will help assist parents. The ultimate aim is to help educate parents and create awareness so as to improve care provided for the child.

==Treatment==

Cleft lip and palate is very treatable; however, the kind of treatment depends on the type and severity of the cleft.

Most children with a form of clefting are monitored by a &quot;cleft palate team&quot; or &quot;craniofacial team&quot; through young adulthood. Care can be lifelong and are looked after by craniofacial cleft teams often consist of: cleft surgeons, orthodontists, speech and language therapists, restorative dentists, psychologists, ENT surgeons and audio-logical physicians. Treatment procedures can vary between craniofacial teams. For example, some teams wait on jaw correction until the child is aged 10 to 12 (argument: growth is less influential as deciduous teeth are replaced by permanent teeth, thus saving the child from repeated corrective surgeries), while other teams correct the jaw earlier (argument: less speech therapy is needed than at a later age when speech therapy becomes harder). Within teams, treatment can differ between individual cases depending on the type and severity of the cleft.

===Cleft lip===
Within the first 2–3 months after birth, surgery is performed to close the cleft lip. While surgery to repair a cleft lip can be performed soon after birth, often the preferred age is at approximately 10 weeks of age, following the &quot;rule of 10s&quot; coined by surgeons Wilhelmmesen and Musgrave in 1969 (the child is at least 10 weeks of age; weighs at least 10 pounds, and has at least 10g/dL hemoglobin). If the cleft is bilateral and extensive, two surgeries may be required to close the cleft, one side first, and the second side a few weeks later. The most common procedure to repair a cleft lip is the &quot;Millard procedure&quot; pioneered by Ralph Millard. Millard performed the first procedure at a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH) unit in Korea.

Often an incomplete cleft lip requires the same surgery as complete cleft. This is done for two reasons. Firstly the group of muscles required to purse the lips run through the upper lip. To restore the complete group a full incision must be made. Secondly, to create a less obvious scar the surgeon tries to line up the scar with the natural lines in the upper lip (such as the edges of the philtrum) and tuck away stitches as far up the nose as possible. Incomplete cleft gives the surgeon more tissue to work with, creating a more supple and natural-looking upper lip.

====Pre-surgical devices====

In some cases of a severe bilateral complete cleft, the premaxillary segment will be protruded far outside the mouth.

Nasoalveolar molding prior to surgery can improve long-term nasal symmetry where there is complete unilateral cleft lip–cleft palate, compared to correction by surgery alone, according to a retrospective cohort study. In this study, significant improvements in nasal symmetry were observed in multiple areas including measurements of the projected length of the nasal ala (lateral surface of the external nose), position of the superoinferior alar groove, position of the mediolateral nasal dome, and nasal bridge deviation. &quot;The nasal ala projection length demonstrated an average ratio of 93.0 percent in the surgery-alone group and 96.5 percent in the nasoalveolar molding group,&quot; this study concluded. A systematic review found in conclusion that nasoalveolar molding had a positive effect on the primary surgery of cleft lip/or palate treatment and aesthetics.

===Cleft palate===
Often a cleft palate is temporarily covered by a palatal obturator (a prosthetic device made to fit the roof of the mouth covering the gap). This device re-positions displaced alveolar segments and helps reduce the cleft lip separation. The obturator will improve speech as there&#x27;s now proper airflow and improve feeding and breathing as the gap in the hard and soft palate is closed over so cannot affect it.

Cleft palate can also be corrected by surgery, usually performed between 6 and 12 months. Approximately 20–25% only require one palatal surgery to achieve a competent velopharyngeal valve capable of producing normal, non-hypernasal speech. However, combinations of surgical methods and repeated surgeries are often necessary as the child grows. One of the new innovations of cleft lip and cleft palate repair is the Latham appliance. The Latham is surgically inserted by use of pins during the child&#x27;s fourth or fifth month. After it is in place, the doctor, or parents, turn a screw daily to bring the cleft together to assist with future lip or palate repair.

If the cleft extends into the maxillary alveolar ridge, the gap is usually corrected by filling the gap with bone tissue. The bone tissue can be acquired from the individual&#x27;s own chin, rib or hip.

At age 1–7 years the child is regularly reviewed by the cleft team.

Age 7–12 years, for the children born with alveolar clefts, they may need to have a secondary alveolar bone graft. This is where autogenous cancellous bone from a donor site (often the pelvic bone) is transplanted into the alveolar cleft region. This transplant of bone will close the osseous cleft of the alveolus, close any oro-nasal fistulae and will become integrated with the maxillary bone. It provides bone for teeth to erupt into and to allow implants to be placed as a possible future treatment option. The procedure should be carried out before the upper canine has erupted. Ideally the root of the canine should be one to two-thirds formed and that there is a space available to place the bone graft. Radio-graphs are taken to determine the quantity of missing bone in the cleft area.

==== Other surgeries ====
Orthognathic surgery – surgical cutting of bone to realign the upper jaw (osteotomy). The bone is cut then re-positioned and held together by wires or rigid fixation plates to ensure there&#x27;s no anterior-posterior discrepancy, also to reduce scarring as it reduces growth. Single piece or multi-piece osteotomy exist. Single piece osteotomy is carried out where there is sufficient alveolar continuity achieved from a successful bone graft. Multi piece osteotomy is performed when there is a notable residual alveolar defect with a dental gap and oronasal fistula (communication between the oral and nasal cavities). The goal of both single and multi piece osteotomy is to displace the maxilla forward to obtain adequate occlusion as well to provide better support for upper lip and the nose and to close any fistulae.

Distraction osteogenesis – bone lengthening by gradual distraction. This involves cutting bone and moving ends apart incrementally to allow new bone to form in the gap. This consists of several phases. After attachment of the distracting device and the bone cuts, there is a latency phase of 3–7 days when a callus forms. In the activation phase distraction of the callus induces bony ingrowth which can last up to 15 days depending on the required distraction. Once the required bone length is reached, the distraction device is left to remain in situ as it acts as a rigid skeletal fixation device until the new bone has matured (known as the consolidation period).

===Speech===
Velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI) can occur as a result of an unrepaired or repaired cleft lip and palate. VPI is the inability of the soft palate to close tightly against the back of the throat during speech, resulting in incomplete velopharyngeal closure. In turn, this results in speech abnormalities. Velopharyngeal closure is necessary during speech because it forms a seal between the nose and mouth, allowing the production of normal speech sounds. VPI can cause hypernasality (excessive nasal resonance), hyponasality (reduced nasal resonance), or a mixed nasal resonance, which is when hypernasality and hyponasality occur simultaneously. In addition, CLP may cause abnormal positioning of individual teeth, which can in turn affect the patient&#x27;s ability to make certain sounds when speaking such as the &quot;f&quot; or &quot;v&quot; sound and can also result in a lisp. The changes in speech may also be a manifestation on CLP&#x27;s effects on the patient&#x27;s occlusion.

===Hearing===
Children with cleft palate have a very high risk of developing a middle ear infection, specifically otitis media. This is due to the immature development of the different bones and muscles in the ear. Otitis media is caused by the obstruction of the Eustachian tube, negative middle ear pressure and fluid build-up in the normally air-filled space of the middle ear. This is associated with hearing impairment or loss. The insertion of a ventilation tube into the eardrum is a surgical treatment option commonly used to improve hearing in children with otitis media. In addition, breast milk has been proven to decrease the incidence of otitis media in infants with clefts.

=== Feeding ===
There are different options on how to feed a baby with cleft lip or cleft palate which include: breast-feeding, bottle feeding, spoon feeding and syringe feeding. Although breast-feeding is challenging, it improves weight-gain compared to spoon-feeding. Nasal regurgitation is common due to the open space between the oral cavity and the nasal cavity. Bottle feeding can help (with squeezable bottles being easier to use than rigid bottles). In addition, maxillary plates can be added to aid in feeding. Whatever feeding method is established, it is important to keep the baby&#x27;s weight gain and hydration monitored. Infants with cleft lip or palate may require supplemental feeds for adequate growth and nutrition. Breast feeding position as suggested by specialists can also improve success rate.

==== Breast-feeding ====
Babies with cleft lip are more likely to breastfeed successfully than those with cleft palate and cleft lip and palate. Larger clefts of the soft or hard palate may not be able to generate suction as the oral cavity cannot be separated from the nasal cavity when feeding which leads to fatigue, prolonged feeding time, impaired growth and nutrition. Changes in swallowing mechanics may result in coughing, choking, gagging and nasal regurgitation. Even after cleft repair, the problem may still persist as significant motor learning of swallowing and sucking was absent for many months before repair. These difficulties in feeding may result in secondary problems such as poor weight gain, excessive energy expenditure during feeding, lengthy feeding times, discomfort during feeding, and stressful feeding interactions between the infant and the mother. A potential source of discomfort for the baby during or after feeding is bloating or frequent &quot;spit up&quot; which is due to the excessive air intake through the nose and mouth in the open cleft. Babies with cleft lip and or palate should be evaluated individually taking into account the size and location of the cleft and the mother&#x27;s previous experience with breastfeeding.

Another option is feeding breast milk via bottle or syringe. Since babies with clip lip and cleft palate generate less section when breastfeeding, their nutrition, hydration and weight gain may be affected. This may result in the need for supplemental feeds. Modifying the position of holding the baby may increase the effectiveness and efficiency of breastfeeding.

==== Alternative Feeding Methods ====
Preoperative feeding – using a squeezable bottle instead of a rigid bottle can allow a higher volume of food intake and less effort to extract food. Using a syringe is practical, easy to perform and allows greater administered volume of food. It also means there will be weight gain and less time spent feeding.

Post-operative feeding (isolated lip repair, or lip repair associated or not with palatoplasty) – post palatoplasty, some studies believe that inappropriate negative pressure on the suture line may affect results. Babies can be fed by a nasogastric tube instead. Studies suggest babies required less analgesics and shorter hospital stay with nasogastric feeding post-surgery. With bottle-feeding, there was higher feeding rejection and pain and required more frequent and prolonged feeding times.

===Treatment schedule===
Each person&#x27;s treatment schedule is individualized. The table below shows a common sample treatment schedule. The colored squares indicate the average timeframe in which the indicated procedure occurs. In some cases, this is usually one procedure, for example lip repair. In other cases, it is an ongoing therapy, for example speech therapy. In most cases of cleft lip and palate that involve the alveolar bone, patients will need a treatment plan including the prevention of cavities, orthodontics, alveolar bone grafting, and possibly jaw surgery.
===Cleft team===
People with CLP present with a multiplicity of problems. Therefore, effective management of CLP involves a wide range of specialists. The current model for delivery of this care is the multidisciplinary cleft team. This is a group of individuals from different specialist backgrounds who work closely together to provide patients with comprehensive care from birth through adolescence. This system of delivery of care enables the individuals within the team to function in an interdisciplinary way, so that all aspects of care for CLP patients can be provided in the best way possible.

===Outcomes assessment===
Measuring the outcomes of CLP treatment has been laden with difficulty due to the complexity and longitudinal nature of cleft care, which spans birth through young adulthood. Prior attempts to study the effectiveness of specific interventions or overall treatment protocols have been hindered by a lack of data standards for outcomes assessment in cleft care.

The International Consortium for Health Outcome Measurement (ICHOM) has proposed the Standard Set of Outcome Measures for Cleft Lip and Palate. The ICHOM Standard Set includes measures for many of the important outcome domains in cleft care (hearing, breathing, eating/drinking, speech, oral health, appearance and psychosocial well-being). It includes clinician-reported, patient-reported, and family-reported outcome measures.

==Epidemiology==

Cleft lip and palate occurs in about 1 to 2 per 1000 births in the developed world.

Rates for cleft lip with or without cleft palate and cleft palate alone varies within different ethnic groups.

According to CDC, the prevalence of cleft palate in the United States is 6.35/10000 births and the prevalence of cleft lip with or without cleft palate is 10.63/10000 births. The highest prevalence rates for cleft lip, either with or without cleft palate are reported for Native Americans and Asians. Africans have the lowest prevalence rates.
* Native Americans: 3.74/1000
* Japanese: 0.82/1000 to 3.36/1000
* Chinese: 1.45/1000 to 4.04/1000
* White Americans: 1.43/1000 to 1.86/1000
* Latin Americans: 1.04/1000
* Africans: 0.18/1000 to 1.67/1000

Cleft lip and cleft palate caused about 3,800 deaths globally in 2017, down from 14,600 deaths in 1990.

Prevalence of &quot;cleft uvula&quot; has varied from 0.02% to 18.8% with the highest numbers found among Chippewa and Navajo and the lowest generally in Africans.

==Society and culture==
===Handicap law and abortion controversies===

In some countries, cleft lip or palate deformities are considered reasons (either generally tolerated or officially sanctioned) to perform an abortion beyond the legal fetal age limit, even though the fetus is not in jeopardy of life or limb. Some political opponents contend this practice amounts to eugenics based on cosmetic defects rather than practical definitions of a disability.

===Works of fiction===
The eponymous hero of J. M. Coetzee&#x27;s 1983 novel &quot;Life &amp; Times of Michael K&quot; has a cleft lip that is never corrected. In the 1920 novel &quot;Growth of the Soil,&quot; by Norwegian writer Knut Hamsun, Inger (wife of the main character) has an uncorrected cleft lip which puts heavy limitations on her life, even causing her to kill her own child, who is also born with a cleft lip. The protagonist of the 1924 novel &quot;Precious Bane&quot;, by English writer Mary Webb, is a young woman living in 19th-century rural Shropshire who eventually comes to feel that her deformity is the source of her spiritual strength. The book was later adapted for television by both the BBC and ORTF in France. Similarly, the main character in Graham Greene&#x27;s 1936 crime noir novel &quot;A Gun for Sale&quot;, Raven, has a cleft lip which he is sensitive about, and is described as &quot;an ugly man dedicated to ugly deeds&quot;. In the 1976 Patricia A. McKillip novel &quot;The Night Gift&quot;, one of the high-school aged protagonists is shy because she has a cleft lip, but learns to have more confidence in herself.

In the first edition of &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot;, one of the people Gilderoy Lockhart stole credit from was a witch with a harelip who banished the Bandon Banshee. In later editions, this was changed to a witch with a hairy chin.

In chapter 26 of Mark Twain&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot;, Huck Finn meets the three Wilks sisters, Mary Jane, Susan, and Joanna. Joanna is described as, &quot;the one who gives herself to good works and has a hare-lip.&quot; As a form of offensive synecdoche, Huck Finn refers to Joanna as &quot;the hare-lip&quot; rather than by her name.

Cleft lip and cleft palate are often portrayed negatively in popular culture. Examples include Oddjob, the secondary villain of the James Bond novel &quot;Goldfinger&quot; by Ian Fleming (the film adaptation does not mention this but leaves it implied) and serial killer Francis Dolarhyde in the novel &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and its screen adaptations, &quot;Manhunter&quot;, &quot;Red Dragon&quot;, and &quot;Hannibal&quot;. The portrayal of enemy characters with cleft lips and cleft palates, dubbed mutants, in the 2019 video game &quot;Rage 2&quot; left Chris Plante of &quot;Polygon&quot; wondering if the condition would ever be portrayed positively.

===Notable cases===


==Other animals==
Cleft lips and palates are occasionally seen in cattle and dogs, and rarely in goats, sheep, cats, horses, pandas and ferrets. Most commonly, the defect involves the lip, rhinarium, and premaxilla. Clefts of the hard and soft palate are sometimes seen with a cleft lip. The cause is usually hereditary. Brachycephalic dogs such as Boxers and Boston Terriers are most commonly affected. An inherited disorder with incomplete penetrance has also been suggested in Shih tzus, Swiss Sheepdogs, Bulldogs, and Pointers. In horses, it is a rare condition usually involving the caudal soft palate. In Charolais cattle, clefts are seen in combination with arthrogryposis, which is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. It is also inherited as an autosomal recessive trait in Texel sheep. Other contributing factors may include maternal nutritional deficiencies, exposure &quot;in utero&quot; to viral infections, trauma, drugs, or chemicals, or ingestion of toxins by the mother, such as certain lupines by cattle during the second or third month of gestation. The use of corticosteroids during pregnancy in dogs and the ingestion of &quot;Veratrum californicum&quot; by pregnant sheep have also been associated with cleft formation.

Difficulty with nursing is the most common problem associated with clefts, but aspiration pneumonia, regurgitation, and malnutrition are often seen with cleft palate and is a common cause of death. Providing nutrition through a feeding tube is often necessary, but corrective surgery in dogs can be done by the age of twelve weeks. For cleft palate, there is a high rate of surgical failure resulting in repeated surgeries. Surgical techniques for cleft palate in dogs include prosthesis, mucosal flaps, and microvascular free flaps. Affected animals should not be bred due to the hereditary nature of this condition.

<text>Virginia Tech (VT), officially the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (VPI), is a public land-grant research university with its main campus in Blacksburg, Virginia, United States. It was founded as the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College in 1872.

The university also has educational facilities in six regions statewide, a research center in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, and a study-abroad site in Riva San Vitale, Switzerland. Through its Corps of Cadets ROTC program, Virginia Tech is a senior military college.

Virginia Tech offers 280 undergraduate and graduate degree programs to its 37,000 students; as of 2016, it was the state&#x27;s second-largest public university by enrollment. It is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;.

The university&#x27;s athletic teams are known as the Virginia Tech Hokies and compete in Division I of the NCAA as members of the Atlantic Coast Conference.

==History==

In 1872, with federal funds provided by the Morrill Act of 1862, the Reconstruction-era Virginia General Assembly purchased the facilities of Preston and Olin Institute, a small Methodist school for boys in Southwest Virginia&#x27;s rural Montgomery County. That same year, of the adjoining Solitude Farm including the house and several farm buildings on the estate were acquired for $21,250 from Robert Taylor Preston, a son of Governor of Virginia, James Patton Preston. The commonwealth incorporated a new institution on the site, a state-supported land-grant military institute named Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College.

Virginia Tech&#x27;s first student, Addison &quot;Add&quot; Caldwell registered on October 1, 1872, after hiking over 25 miles from his home in Craig County, Virginia. A statue, located in the Upper Quad of campus commemorates Add&#x27;s journey to enroll. First-year cadets and their training cadre re-enact Addison Caldwell&#x27;s journey every year in the Caldwell March. They complete the first half of the 26-mile march in the fall and the second half in the spring.

The first five presidents of Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College served in the Confederate States Army or the Confederate government during the Civil War as did many of its early professors including the first Commandant, James H. Lane, a VMI graduate and former Confederate General who taught civil engineering and commerce at the college and is the namesake of Lane Hall, one of the oldest buildings on campus, built in 1888. Its third president, Thomas Nelson Conrad, was a notorious Confederate spy who ran a covert intelligence gathering operation from a home in the heart of Washington, D.C. Its sixth president, Paul Brandon Barringer, was a son of Confederate General Rufus Barringer and a nephew of Confederate Generals Stonewall Jackson and Daniel Harvey Hill.

In a nod to this southern heritage the Confederate Battle Flag was traditionally waved by cheerleaders at Virginia Tech football games and the Highty-Tighties played Dixie as a fight song when the Hokies scored a touchdown. A large Confederate flag also hung inside Cassell Coliseum where Virginia Tech basketball games are played. Since 1963, &quot;Skipper&quot;, a replica of a Civil War cannon has been fired at football games by members of the Corps of Cadets when the team scores. The Confederate Flag was also prominently featured on all Virginia Tech class rings. The display of the Confederate flag at athletic events ended in the late 1960s after Marguerite Harper, a black woman attending Virginia Tech on a Rockefeller Scholarship for culturally disadvantaged students, was elected to the student senate during her sophomore year and made a successful resolution to end the practice. Following the resolution there was a large demonstration in opposition to the removal of the Confederate flag. The campus was covered in Confederate flags and &quot;Dixie&quot; was blasting from dormitory windows. Harper and her white roommate received hate mail and threatening phone calls, but the resolution stood, and the display of the rebel flag ended in 1969. The Confederate flag on Virginia Tech class rings became optional in 1972 and could be left off of the ring at the student&#x27;s request. The Confederate flag has since been removed from class ring designs entirely.

Under the leadership of seventh president Joseph Dupuy Eggleston, who held the position from 1913 to 1919, the university established a Reserve Officer Training Corps to support national efforts during World War I.

Early on the morning of March 13, 1917, physics professor Charles E. Vawter, Jr. (son of Charles E. Vawter, who had served on the VPI board of visitors from 1886 to 1900), shot Stockton Heth, Jr., a scion of one of Montgomery County&#x27;s wealthiest families, in his campus home on faculty row. Heth, who lived at Whitethorne, an antebellum mansion on a 1,500-acre estate near Blacksburg, later died of his wounds in a Roanoke hospital. Due to the Heth family&#x27;s wealth and political connections, Vawter&#x27;s position as head of the VPI physics department, and the scandalous extramarital affair that led to the shooting, the resulting murder trial was one of the most sensational in Virginia history (Vawter was acquitted, and left the school). Eggleston attempted to suppress news of the affair in the media with considerable success, most likely due to the Russian Revolution and the US declaration of war on Germany that stole the headlines in the spring of 1917, rather than his efforts to protect VPI&#x27;s reputation.

===College reorganizations===
During Thomas Nelson Conrad&#x27;s tenure as president, the college switched from semesters to the quarter system, which remained in place until the late 1980s. Under the 1891–1907 presidency of John McLaren McBryde, the school organized its academic programs into a traditional four-year college and a graduate department was founded. The evolution of the school&#x27;s programs led to a name change in 1896 to Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College and Polytechnic Institute. The &quot;Agricultural and Mechanical College&quot; portion of the name was popularly omitted almost immediately; in 1944, the name was officially changed to Virginia Polytechnic Institute (VPI).

VPI admitted its first female students in 1921 as civilian day students; they did not live on campus. In 1923, VPI changed a policy of compulsory participation in the Corps of Cadets from four years to two years. In 1931, VPI began teaching classes at the Norfolk Division of the College of William and Mary (now Old Dominion University). This program eventually developed into a two-year engineering program that allowed students to transfer to VPI for their final two years of degree work.


The first women&#x27;s dormitory at VPI, Hillcrest Hall, was built in 1940. In 1943, VPI merged with Radford State Teachers College in nearby Radford, which became VPI&#x27;s women&#x27;s division; the merger was dissolved in 1964. Today, Radford University is a co-educational research university that enrolls nearly 10,000 students and offers more than 150 undergraduate and graduate programs.

===Post–World War II===

In 1953, under the leadership of President Walter Stephenson Newman, VPI became the first historically white, four-year public institution among the 11 states in the former Confederacy to admit a black undergraduate. Three more black students were admitted in 1954. At the time Virginia still enforced Jim Crow laws and largely practiced racial segregation in public and private education, churches, neighborhoods, restaurants, and movie theaters and these first black students at VPI were not allowed to live in residence halls or eat in the dining halls on campus. Instead, they boarded with African American families in Blacksburg. In 1958, Charlie L. Yates made history as the first African American to graduate from VPI. Yates earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in mechanical engineering, with honors, and was hailed as the first African American &quot;to be graduated from any major Southern engineering institute,&quot; according to news reports at the time.

VPI President T. Marshall Hahn, whose tenure ran from 1962 to 1974, was responsible for many of the programs and policies that transformed VPI from a small, historically white, predominately male, military institute with a primary focus on undergraduate teaching into a major co-educational research university. The student body that had been approximately 5,682 in 1962 increased by roughly 1,000 students each year, new dormitories and academic buildings were constructed, faculty members were added – in 1966, for instance, more than 100 new professors joined the faculty – and research budgets were increased. During Hahn&#x27;s tenure, not only did the university graduate its first Rhodes Scholar, W.W. Lewis, Class of 1963, the requirement for male students to participate in the Corps of Cadets for two years was dropped in 1964. Beginning in the fall of 1973, women could participate in the Corps, making Virginia Tech among the nation&#x27;s first senior military colleges to integrate women.

In 1970, the state legislature allowed VPI university status and gave it the present legal name, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. In the early 1990s, university administration authorized the official use of Virginia Tech as equivalent to the full legal name, officially adopting a nickname dating to the 1910s. &quot;Virginia Tech&quot; has been used as the first-reference name for the school&#x27;s athletic teams since the 1970s. However, diplomas and transcripts still spell out the formal name. Similarly, the abbreviation &quot;VT&quot; is far more common today than either VPI or VPI&amp;SU.

===Vietnam War era===
During the Vietnam War, students on college campuses across the nation protested the draft and U.S. involvement in the conflict. Despite its long history as a military school, Virginia Tech was no exception. Most protests at Virginia Tech were small sit-ins and teach-ins, but In mid-April 1970 a group of anti-war protesters including students and faculty members disrupted a Corps of Cadets drill on campus. The Virginia Tech administration under Hahn took swift action. The students involved were suspended and the faculty members involved were fired from the university and the administration went to court and obtained an injunction to prevent them from repeating the act. This succeeded in calming tensions on campus, but only for a few weeks.

Tensions on campus reached the boiling point several days following the Kent State Shootings when on May 12, 1970, a large mob including students and a number of non-student anti-war protesters enraged by the Kent State incident and angered by the administration&#x27;s disciplinary actions in response to a number of recent infractions by protesters including; vandalism of university property, a series of potentially dangerous fires set on campus, breaking and entering into a university building, and a sit-in in Cowgill Hill, seized Williams Hall and barricaded themselves inside. The administration responded quickly calling in law enforcement and early the following morning Virginia State Police forced their way into Williams Hall and began rounding up the protesters. Once inside the building the police discovered bomb making materials and determined that the students had apparently intended to build a firebomb. The first few protesters were dragged out of the building; the rest left peacefully and were arrested and taken to the Montgomery County jail. The students involved in the seizure, were suspended from Virginia Tech and given twenty-four hours to remove their belongings from campus after being released from jail.

Several more anti-war protests occurred at Virginia Tech during the early 1970s, but none turned violent.

===Late 20th century===

The university continued to expand through the last quarter of the 20th century. In 1975 William E. Lavery, who had joined the Virginia Tech faculty in 1966, took over as president when Hahn left the university to join Georgia-Pacific.

Desperate for additional farmland for the support of teaching, research, and extension programs in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Virginia Tech acquired Kentland Farm on December 31, 1986. Virginia Tech secretly traded about 250 acres of research orchards adjacent to a commercial area that would soon become Christiansburg&#x27;s main shopping district to a group of developers for the historic but long fallow 1,785-acre Kentland property. The developers on the other end of the swap, one of whom was a former Tech athletics official, quickly sold 40 acres of the former university farmland for $2.7 million. News of the land swap, and especially the fact that it was done behind closed doors, with no input from College of Agriculture faculty sparked outrage.

Also in 1986, Virginia Tech became embroiled in an athletic scandal sparked by allegations of illegal recruiting, the bitter departure of two athletic directors in less than a year and millions of dollars of debt run up by the university&#x27;s sports program due to mismanagement of financial resources, million dollar coaching contracts, and lavish expense accounts for athletics officials that led to a rebuke from Governor of Virginia, Gerald Baliles in 1987. Baliles, the featured speaker at the Virginia Tech&#x27;s 115th annual commencement exercises, scolded the Virginia Tech Board of Visitors for the scandal and warned other state-supported institutions in Virginia not to put athletics ahead of academics.

Lavery developed a reorganization plan for the troubled Athletic Department, and Frank Beamer was hired to replace Bill Dooley as head football coach, but with negative publicity continuing to swirl within and around the university, he announced his resignation on October 16, 1987, effective December 31, 1987, to prevent polarization of the campus. He was succeeded as president by James Douglas McComas who served until 1994.

Due to the unpopularity of US involvement in the Vietnam War enrollment in the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets spiraled downward through the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. In 1991 through the efforts of Henry Dekker (Class of 1944) The Corps of Cadets Alumni Inc. was created to save the corps, whose numbers had declined to only a few hundred students. In 1992 the alumni organization-initiated Corps Review, a newsletter that was expanded to a magazine in 2004 and targeted corps alumni. In the mid-1990s, the corps alumni organization set a goal of &quot;1000 in 2000&quot; and initiated a major campaign to push the number of cadets to 1,000 by the turn of the century. The goal was not reached, but membership in the corps did increase substantially by the end of the decade.

===21st century===
The early decades of this century have seen expansion across the university&#x27;s institutions in both physical and population sizes. In 2001, Virginia Tech acquired 326 acres of the Heth Farm adjacent to campus, increasing the College Farm to over 3,000 acres. The Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine and Research Institute was created with a strategic partnership with the Carilion Clinic and the governor of Virginia. These years also brought about the rapid development of the university&#x27;s professional schools of graduate education and business programs. Virginia Tech brought in over $500 million in research expenditures in 2014.

The establishment of scholarships for cadets and a resurgence of national patriotism after the September 11 attacks helped the corps recruit new cadets, increasing the ranks to 1,127 by 2018—the largest corps the university has seen since the mid-1960s. The Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets is poised to increase enrollment to 1,400 in coming years.

====2007 mass shooting====

On April 16, 2007, Virginia Tech student Seung-Hui Cho fatally shot 32 faculty members and students and wounded 17 others in two locations on campus before killing himself. The massacre is the deadliest mass shooting on an American college campus, surpassing the University of Texas tower shooting in 1966. Although it was at the time the deadliest mass shooting committed by a lone gunman in U.S. history, it has since been surpassed by two shootings at an Orlando nightclub and an outdoor music festival in Las Vegas. It is the second-deadliest school massacre in U.S. history, surpassed only by the Bath School bombing in 1927 that killed 44.

The Virginia Tech massacre led to an intense nationwide debate over gun rights, gun safety and efficacy of gun-free zones. It prompted many states to introduce legislation to prohibit public colleges and universities from banning concealed weapons on campus for permit holders. In 2013, at least 19 states introduced legislation to allow concealed carry on campus in some form, and in the 2014 legislative session, at least 14 states introduced similar legislation. On December 8, 2011, a campus police officer Deriek Crouse was fatally shot by Radford University student Ross Truett Ashley, 22, before he took his own life. In 2016, Tennessee passed a bill permitting faculty members to carry handguns on campus after notifying local law enforcement. In 2015, Texas became the eighth state to allow concealed weapons on college campuses. In December 2016, Governor John Kasich signed a bill into law that lifted Ohio&#x27;s statewide ban on firearms on college campuses, leaving the decision to the institutions. In 2017, Georgia became the tenth state to prohibit colleges and universities from banning concealed weapons on campus. Virginia law allows individual institutions to make the decision whether to allow concealed weapons on campus, but Virginia Tech continues to ban concealed carry permit holders from carrying guns on campus.
====Innovation Campus and further growth====
After Amazon unveiled its second headquarters in Crystal City, Virginia, Virginia Tech announced plans to build a $1 billion graduate research center adjacent to the facility. The Virginia Tech Innovation Campus will be housed at a million-square-foot campus in Alexandria. It is expected to educate hundreds of graduate students. The Innovation Campus will focus on computer science and software engineering, with specializations in areas including artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and data analytics.

Due to rapid growth of incoming freshmen classes, the university announced in 2019 that it would offer 1,559 incoming, in-state freshmen financial incentives to skip the 2019–20 school year in Blacksburg. Expecting a larger-than-planned class size, the university budgeted $3.3 million for the endeavor. Virginia Tech also waived the requirement that freshmen live on campus for the 2019–20 school year, leased an off-campus Holiday Inn, and converted its on-campus hotel to house students.

==Organization and administration==

Virginia Tech is a public university and one of Virginia&#x27;s two land-grant institutions. Its academic programs are administered by nine colleges, the Graduate School, and the Honors College.

==Academics==
Virginia Tech offers 116 bachelor&#x27;s degree programs through its nine undergraduate academic colleges, 160 master&#x27;s and doctoral degree programs through the Graduate School, and a professional degree from the Virginia–Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine. In addition, the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine and Research Institute is a public-private partnership jointly managed by Virginia Tech and the Carilion Clinic founded on January 3, 2007.

The typical student offered admission had a high-school grade point average of 4.00, with the middle 50 percent ranging from 3.84 and 4.27. The average cumulative SAT score was 1250 (out of 1600), with a middle range ranging from 1160 to 1340. Of the 5,518 students who accepted the offers of admission (for an admissions yield of 38%), 18 percent accepted under the Early Decision Plan. The Office of Undergraduate Admissions is located within the Visitor and Undergraduate Admissions Center.

Virginia Tech offers a highly selective Honors College, which provides undergraduate students 11 different ways to earn Honors credits towards one of the five Honors degree options. Once admitted, Honors students are required to maintain a 3.6 GPA in order to remain in the program. Roughly one-fourth of the approximately 1,600 University Honors students live in one of the two University Honors residential halls, the Honors Residential College located in East Ambler-Johnston and the Hillcrest Honors Community.

For the 2013–14 academic year, the Graduate School at Virginia Tech enrolled 6,723 graduate students (4,465 full-time; 2,258 part-time) in its masters and doctoral programs.

The Pamplin College of Business received 381 applications for its incoming Evening MBA program and offered admission to 142. The class&#x27;s average GMAT was 610, and mean undergraduate GPA was 3.4.

The Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine in Roanoke, Va., received 4,403 applications for its eighth incoming class, the class of 2021, and offered admission to 42. The class&#x27;s MCAT scores range was 503–520 (median 512, mean 512), and mean undergraduate GPA was 3.57.

In 2023, Virginia Tech became the second public university after the U.S. Supreme Court decided &quot;Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard&quot;, banning affirmative action in college admissions, to end its use of legacy admissions. The university also ended its binding early decision program because it &quot;created unneeded pressure on students [...] particularly those needing financial aid&quot;.

==Campus==
The Virginia Tech campus is in Blacksburg, Virginia. Most buildings are built of limestone in a neo-Gothic style. Notable green spaces include the Hahn Horticulture Garden, Virginia Tech Duck Pond, and the old-growth forest, Stadium Woods.

The central campus is roughly bordered by Prices Fork Road to the northwest, Plantation Drive to the west, Main Street to the east, and US 460 Bypass to the south, though it has several thousand acres beyond the central campus.

In the center of the Blacksburg campus lies the Drillfield, a large oval field running northeast to southwest, encircled by a one-way street that is known as Drillfield Drive. The Drillfield&#x27;s name, coined in 1926 after the completion of Virginia Tech&#x27;s first real stadium, Miles Stadium, stems from its use by the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets to conduct military drills. A waterway, Stroubles Creek, runs beneath the Drillfield on the south side. A three-sided conduit for the creek that retains the natural bed of the creek was installed in 1934, and, in 1971, the first two asphalt walks were added.

On the northwestern side of the Drillfield stand most of the university&#x27;s academic and administrative buildings, including Burruss and McBryde Halls. On the southeastern side of the Drillfield stand most of the residential buildings, including students&#x27; residence halls, dining halls, and War Memorial Gym. Newman Library is on the eastern side of campus and connects to Torgersen Bridge, which spans the main road into campus, Alumni Mall. North of the Drillfield and northwest of Alumni Mall lies the Upper Quad, known to many students as military campus. The Upper Quad is home to the Corps of Cadets&#x27; barracks.

On the main campus in Blacksburg, most of the buildings incorporate Hokie Stone as a building material. In 2010, the board of visitors passed a resolution about using the gray stone, shaded by hues of brown and pink, in all building projects.

===Extended campuses===
The university has established five branch campuses:
* Virginia Tech Hampton Roads Centers, Newport News and Virginia Beach

Smith, Jr., Eastern Shore, Eastern Virginia, Hampton Roads, Middleburg, Reynolds Homestead, Shenandoah Valley, Southern Piedmont, Southwest Virginia, Tidewater, and Virginia Seafood.

===Power plant===
Distinguished by a towering 180-foot-high radial brick smokestack, the university&#x27;s coal fired Central Steam Power Plant generates an annual steam output greater than 943 billion BTUs and provides campus buildings with a portion of their heat, hot water, and electricity needs. Nearly 90 percent of campus buildings are connected to the plant through an extensive network of tunnels—the main access point is on the Drillfield—and more than of steam lines and piping provide heat to more than 6.8 million square feet of campus buildings. Only personnel with confined-space training are permitted to enter the tunnel system, comprising of inaccessible tunnel and of piping; of direct-bury piping in the ground; and of accessible tunnel and of piping.

==Student life==
There are more than 700 student organizations on campus. Some of these organizations include Bolt at Virginia Tech which builds electric racing motorcycles; PRISM a student-run ad agency; BASIS at Virginia Tech the largest student-run fixed income portfolio group in the nation managing $5 million; the Chocolate Milk Club; and a Young Life Chapter. Over 9,300 Virginia Tech students reside on campus.

=== Campus residence halls ===
===Corps of Cadets===

Until 1923, every able-bodied male was required to participate for four years in the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets. The requirement was changed to two years until 1964, when participation became voluntary. Members of the ROTC program are required to participate in the Corps of Cadets. Virginia Tech remains one of three public universities in the United States with both an active corps of cadets and regular civilian students on its campus (Texas A&amp;M University and the University of North Georgia are the other two).

More than 1,000 cadets reside on the campus of Virginia Tech. The Corps of Cadets Community is located in the Upper Quad, which features some of the oldest buildings on campus. Cadet dorms are also known as &quot;cadet barracks&quot;. Two new dormitories were constructed on the Upper Quad to house all of the cadets. Pearson Hall replaced Rasche Hall in November 2015, and in August 2017, Brodie Hall was replaced by the New Cadet Dorm (a.k.a. &quot;New Brodie&quot;). Former cadet dorms, Thomas Hall and Monteith Hall were demolished in 2017. Their sites are planned to be used as green space for the foreseeable future.

===Greek life===
Virginia Tech hosts a number of fraternities and sororities across four governing councils. There are 23 IFC fraternities and 13 National Panhellenic Conference sororities recognized at Virginia Tech. The fraternity and sorority community currently encompasses more than 5,500 students which represents just about 20 percent of the undergraduate population. The Oak Lane Community houses those sororities and fraternities which have houses chartered on campus. A number of fraternities have chartered off-campus housing. There are also numerous other academic and service-related sororities and fraternities at the school, as well as various historically Black and cultural interest organizations.

There are also a number of fraternities at Virginia Tech that are not officially recognized by the university.

=== Clubs and student activities ===
Alongside fraternity and sorority life, Virginia Tech offers a variety of clubs and activities officially endorsed by the university. The university claims 800 official clubs as part of its student life and the Student Engagement and Campus Life office as a hub for information on said clubs. A website titled Gobblerconnect is often used by students to find clubs to take part in, while every year the campus holds a &quot;Gobblerfest&quot; where clubs showcase their activities to potential freshmen members.

Notable among these are student-lead production oriented clubs, such as radio station WUVT-FM, newspaper &quot;The Collegiate Times&quot;, and literary magazine &quot;Silhouette&quot;.

== Athletics ==


Virginia Tech teams are known as the Hokies. The HokieBird is a turkey-like creature whose form has evolved from the original school mascot of the Fighting Gobbler. While the modern HokieBird still resembles a Fighting Gobbler, the word &quot;Hokie&quot; has all but replaced Fighting Gobbler in terms of colloquial use. The term originated from the &quot;Old Hokie&quot; yell.

They compete as a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I level (Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) sub-level for football), primarily competing in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) for all sports since the 2004–05 season. The Hokies previously competed in the Big East Conference from 2000–01 to 2003–04 (football program from 1991–92 to 1999–2000); the Atlantic 10 Conference (A-10) from 1995–96 to 1999–2000; and the Metro Conference from 1978–79 to 1994–95.

Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, soccer, swimming and diving, tennis, track and field and wrestling. Women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, field hockey, golf, lacrosse, rowing, soccer, softball, swimming and diving, tennis, track and field and volleyball.

Virginia Tech&#x27;s fight song, &quot;Tech Triumph&quot;, was written in 1919 and remains in use today. The song is played at sporting events by both the Virginia Tech student band, The Marching Virginians, and the regimental Corps of Cadets&#x27; band, the Highty Tighties.

The most prominent athletic facilities are Lane Stadium, Cassell Coliseum, English Field, Thompson Field, Tech Softball Park, Rector Field House, the Beamer-Lawson Indoor Practice Facility, and the Christiansburg Aquatic Center.

==Controversial actions==
Jacques Toubon is known for the controversial so-called Toubon Law, enforcing the use of the French language in official French government publications, and advertisements published in France. Since the law can largely be described as being hostile to English, Jacques Toubon is sometimes referred to, jokingly, as &quot;Mr Allgood&quot; (&quot;All Good&quot; being a translation of &quot;Tout bon&quot;).

Jacques Toubon is also remembered for the &quot;helicopter affair&quot;. In 1996, an initial criminal enquiry had been opened by Laurent Davenas, then head prosecutor of Évry for alleged misuse of government funds, in which Xavière Tiberi, wife of then mayor of Paris Jean Tiberi (from Toubon&#x27;s party) was involved. &quot;(See corruption scandals in the Paris region&quot;). However, this was not a full criminal investigation and no investigative magistrate had been named. Davenas then went on vacation in the Himalaya. His deputy then announced his decision to open a full investigation. The Rally for the Republic leaders were frightened by the possible implications of such an investigation, and Jacques Toubon, then minister of justice, famously hired a helicopter to fetch the mountaineering prosecutor and convince him to rein in his deputy (Davenas refused). 

Jacques Toubon has been the topic of much lampooning. In addition to &quot;Mr Allgood&quot;, &quot;Les Guignols de l&#x27;info&quot; have referred to him as &quot;M. Bouffon&quot; (&quot;Mr Buffoon&quot;).

==Personal life==
He was married to art expert Lise Toubon.

<text>Viļāni () (, ) is a town in Rēzekne Municipality in the Latgale region of Latvia. The railway line Riga-Moscow, and the motor highway Riga-Moscow, and the road Preiļi-Balvi cross Viļāni. The Malta river flows through the town. The population in 2020 was 2,813.

==History==
The town was mentioned for the first time in 1495 with the name Wielona. In 1507, the largest estate of Latgale region became the property of de Overlak. In 1752, M. Riks, who was the ruler of Inflanty, bought the Viļāni estate. He was the first landlord who very positively influenced the development of the region. The monastery and the St. Michael church in the baroque style were built under his leadership. The monks of the Bernardine Order were housed in the monastery. Because of the revolt of the Poles in 1830, the monastery had a library with 463 church books in Latin and Polish.
The location on the trade road Riga-Rēzekne favoured the development of Viļāni. In 1839, the Viļāni estate became the property of Vincent Janovskis. At the beginning of the 1850s, Janovskis built a three-storied flax mill. There were only three such flax mills in Russian Empire at that time. In Viļāni there was the largest leather production factory in Russia. It supplied the tsarist army with belts, bags, footwear, saddles and leather accessories. In the estate, there were also several small factories, for example two limekilns, a brick factory, mills, breweries. In 1852, Viļāni was called a hamlet. There were 12 houses, the two-storied White tavern (once a horses&#x27; post station), and several shops and bakeries. In 1862, Viļāni received the official right of a hamlet.
In 1924, monks and priests B. Skrinda and B. Valpirts of the Marijani Congregation arrived to Viļāni. They revived the abbey, restored the monastery, adding the second floor to the building. In 1925, there were 4 schools in Viļāni. When Viļāni got the town right on February 25, 1928, it had a territory of 1.63 square kilometres and 65 trade enterprises. In the initial stage of Operation Barbarossa, on 2 July 1941, Viļāni was captured by troops of the German Army Group North. On 25 July 1941, the town was placed under the administration of the newly created Reichskommissariat Ostland. About a half of inhabitants of Viļāni was killed in World War II by the Nazis. The town was also destroyed. Viļāni was recaptured on 28 July 1944 by troops of the Soviet 2nd Baltic Front.

The Viļāni railway station is also an architecture monument that is worth seeing. The interior of this building in neo-eclectic traditions is well preserved.

The Lakstīgalu sala (&#x27;island of nightingales&#x27;) with an open-air stage, located not far from the Viļāni estate, is a favourite recreation place of the inhabitants of Viļāni.
The Viļāni museum tells about the history of Viļāni from the ancient times to nowadays. Approximately 100 animals, which are living in the forests of Latgale region, are exhibited in the Viļāni forest museum.

The memorial plaque for the victims of totalitarian regime was unveiled in 1995, the memorial plaque of the liberators of Viļāni on January 11, 1920, and the memorial cross of the national fighters against the Soviet regime in 1999.

==Economy==
There are 58 enterprises, including 8 branch offices, now in Viļāni. The woodworking enterprise, the charcoal producing enterprise and the printing house “Katoļu dzeive” are the largest of those. The local television was established in 1992. The Viļāni hydroelectric power station, built in 1950 and renewed in 1994, is the first renewed private hydroelectric power station in Latvia.

<doc id="239914" wikidata="Q1439629" url="?curid=239914" title="Providence College">
<text>Providence College is a private Catholic university in Providence, Rhode Island, United States. Founded in 1917 by the Dominican Order and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Providence, it offers 47 undergraduate majors and 17 graduate programs. 

The college requires all of its undergraduate students to complete 16 credits in the Development of Western Civilization, a major part of the college&#x27;s core curriculum. In the spring of 2021, it enrolled 4,128 undergraduate students and 688 graduate students for a total enrollment of 4,816 students.

In athletics, Providence College competes in NCAA Division I, and is a founding member of the original Big East Conference and Hockey East. It was part of the original six other basketball-centric Catholic colleges which broke off from the original Big East (today&#x27;s American Athletic Conference) to form the current Big East at the start of the 2013–14 academic year.

==History==

===Founding===
In 1917, Providence College was founded as an all-male school through the efforts of the Diocese of Providence and the Dominican Province of St. Joseph. The central figure in the college&#x27;s incorporation was Matthew Harkins, Bishop of Providence, who sought an institution that would establish a center of advanced learning for the Catholic youth of Rhode Island.

Opening its doors at the corner of Eaton Street and River Avenue with only one building, Harkins Hall, the college under inaugural president Dennis Albert Casey, O.P. (1917–1921), began with 71 students and nine Dominican faculty members. Under second president William D. Noon, O.P. (1921–1927), the college added its first lay faculty member and opened its first dormitory, Guzman Hall (now known as Martin Hall). Under President Lorenzo C. McCarthy, O.P. (1927–1936), Providence College athletics soon received their moniker as the &quot;Friars.&quot; With black and white as team colors, the school had early success in basketball, football, and baseball. In 1933, the school received regional accreditation by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges. The college conferred its first Master of Arts, Doctor of Philosophy, and Master of Science degrees by 1935, which was also the year that the school&#x27;s newspaper (&quot;The Cowl&quot;) was first published.

The college&#x27;s fundraising efforts during World War II spurred the physical growth of the campus. One of the most notable gifts came from a young MGM film star, Judy Garland, who at just fifteen years old, sold autographs in front of the Loew&#x27;s State Theater for $5-$10 per copy on February 18, 1938. Judy brought the gifts to a Bridge and Fashion Show and gave them to Father Dillon&#x27;s Aquinas Hall Fund.

By 1939, Aquinas Hall dormitory had been built to accommodate more students enrolling in general studies, but with the impact of World War II upon enrollment, President John J. Dillon, O.P. (1936–1944) lobbied Rhode Island&#x27;s congressional delegation to pressure the War Department to assign Providence College an Army Specialized Training Program unit. Unit #1188 arrived on campus in the summer of 1943, allowing the college to continue operation. A class of approximately 380 soldiers-in-training studied engineering at Providence College for a year before going overseas.

===Post-World War II expansion===
Robert J. Slavin, O.P. served as president from 1947 to 1961. During his tenure in 1955, Providence acquired the House of Good Shepard property that pushed the original boundaries of campus to Huxley Avenue. Slavin also oversaw the establishment of the Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (ROTC) on campus in 1951, and the Liberal Arts Honors Program in 1957.

The athletics program of the college gained acceptance into the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in 1948. Prior to the opening of Alumni Hall in 1955, the men&#x27;s basketball team played in local Providence high schools. The college also hired Joe Mullaney as the men&#x27;s basketball coach.

President Vincent C. Dore, O.P. (1961–1965) opened the doors of the college&#x27;s graduate school as well as a new dormitory building, now called Meagher Hall. President William P. Haas, O.P. (1965–1971) opened Phillips Memorial Library in 1969.

===Co-educational shift===
In 1967, the college added its first lay faculty members in its Departments of Theology and Philosophy, as well as its first full-time female faculty member. Two years later, the student dress code was abolished. In 1970, the college decided to admit women starting with the 1971–1972 school year. The same year, the first female administrator was hired. By 1975, the first year women graduated after completing a four-year course of study, women had attained highly visible positions in school organizations. Anne Martha Frank was the first women to edit &quot;The Cowl&quot;, the school weekly newspaper. Patricia Slonina became the first woman editor of the literary magazine, &quot;The Alembic&quot;. Ana Margarita Cabrera was the first woman to edit the school yearbook, &quot;The Veritas&quot;.

Subsequent president Thomas R. Peterson, O.P. (1971–1985) instituted the Development of Western Civilization program, while in 1974, the college acquired the property of the former Charles V. Chapin Hospital on the other side of Huxley Avenue. The campus was then split in half by Huxley Avenue, providing an &quot;Upper&quot; campus (due to the uphill nature of the landscape on Smith Hill) and &quot;Lower&quot; campus (the new, flatter area of the college). In 1974, the School of Continuing Education awarded the college&#x27;s first Associate&#x27;s degree.

With men&#x27;s basketball tickets becoming a hot commodity at the 2,600-seat Alumni Hall gymnasium, and with the opening of the Providence Civic Center in 1972, the Friars moved downtown in time for their Final Four appearance behind Providence natives Ernie DiGregorio and Marvin Barnes. Two years later, the men&#x27;s hockey team played their first season in the new home on campus, as Schneider Arena opened in 1974 with Ron Wilson leading the way.

In the early morning hours of December 13, 1977, a dormitory fire killed ten female residents of Aquinas Hall. Meanwhile, the demographics of the student body continued to change, as women outnumbered men in incoming classes and non-Rhode Island students soon outnumbered in-state students. In 1984, Peterson also opened St. Thomas Aquinas Priory at the entrance of campus to accommodate the growing number of Dominican brethren living on campus.

===Expansion===
John F. Cunningham, O.P. (1985–1994) succeeded Peterson as president in 1985 and saw the Friars men&#x27;s hockey team win the inaugural Hockey East Championship the same year over rival Boston College and reach the championship game of the NCAA tournament to lose 2–1 to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Men&#x27;s basketball again took center stage on the Providence campus, as coach Rick Pitino and senior Billy Donovan took the Friars to their second Final Four appearance in the 1987 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament. Cunningham used the exposure and fundraising opportunities to build two apartment-style residence halls on campus, Davis and Bedford Halls, providing an alternative to dormitory and off-campus housing for upperclassmen.

Philip A. Smith, O.P. (1994–2005) succeeded Cunningham in 1994 and oversaw the new influence of women&#x27;s athletics at Providence, as several alumni and then-current students won the gold medal for women&#x27;s ice hockey as part of the U.S. national team in the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan.

By 2001, a new on-campus chapel was built, St. Dominic Chapel, followed three years later by the construction of two other major buildings on &quot;Lower&quot; campus: Suites Hall, a suite-style residence hall to provide added upperclassmen housing, and the Smith Center for the Arts. President Brian J. Shanley, O.P. (2005–2020) oversaw the construction of the Concannon Fitness Center in 2007 as part of an overall renovation to Alumni Hall, as well as renovation and expansion of the Slavin Center in 2009. In 2012, a groundbreaking was held for the Ruane Center for the Humanities.

Shanley also removed the college&#x27;s SAT requirement for admissions in addition to transferring a significant portion of the school&#x27;s scholarship funds to need-based aid, in order to give more diverse students the opportunity to afford the college. In 2008, Shanley oversaw the founding of the Providence College School of Business, creating separate Schools of Arts and Sciences and Professional Studies.

In 2018, Providence College constructed a new building dedicated to the study of natural science, called the Science Complex. Furthermore, in 2018, Providence College opened the $30 million Ruane Friar Development Center (RFDC). The RFDC is a multi-purpose building that features improvements for student-athletes, including a new innovation lab, an expanded sports medicine center, and a student-athlete fueling station.

==Campus==

The college is located on a gated campus in the city&#x27;s Elmhurst neighborhood atop Smith Hill, the highest point in the city of Providence. The campus is located in a residential urban neighborhood about two miles west of downtown Providence. The Smith Hill neighborhood, which borders the east end of campus, is a predominantly low-income area with crime rates higher than the city average.

There are three main gates to campus, at Cunningham Square (the intersection of River Avenue and Eaton Street) and on Huxley Avenue to the upper campus, and at the southeast corner of the lower campus, along Eaton Street. The campus consists of nineteen academic and administrative buildings, nine dormitories, five apartment complexes, three residences, four athletic buildings, a power plant, a physical plant, and a security office gate house. There is also a Dominican cemetery, two quads, four athletic fields, a 25-meter swimming pool, a six-court tennis court complex, an artificial turf field, and several parking areas (including a structure below the turf field).

Renovations completed in 2009 to the Slavin Center, the campus student union, added solar panels and a bioretention system.

After purchasing Huxley Avenue in 2013, the college began a campus transformation project with plans to develop campus facilities to meet the growing needs of the students. The renovations as of October 2015 include the groundbreaking of the Arthur and Patricia Ryan Center for Business Studies, handicap accessibility to Aquinas Hall, and the addition to outdoor classrooms.

==Organization and administration==
Since 1934, Providence College has been governed by a 12-member corporation and a board of trustees consisting of 25 to 35 members.

The corporation consists of four ex officio members: the president of the college, the Prior Provincial of the Dominican Province of St. Joseph, the Bishop of the Diocese of Providence, and the chairman of the board of trustees. In addition, there are eight other members, each of whom serve three-year terms; four are Dominican friars and four are lay persons. The corporation has the &quot;ultimate authority to exercise control over ownership of property, to promulgate and amend the by-laws, to accept or reject the recommendation for election to the Presidency of the College by the Board of Trustees, and to elect members of the Corporation and of the Board of Trustees.&quot;

All other affairs of the college not reserved to the corporation are handled by the board of trustees, which meets three times a year. These duties include &quot;establishing major institutional goals, engaging in long-range planning and policy-making, overseeing the annual operating budget of the College and overseeing the review process and recommending a Dominican Friar for election to the Presidency of the College.&quot; All members of the corporation and the executive vice president of the college serve on the board of trustees as ex officio, in addition to candidates elected by the corporation who serve a maximum of three, three-year terms.

==Academics==
As of 2019, Providence College reports an undergraduate acceptance rate of 47.5 percent. The average class size is 21 students, with nearly half of all classes including fewer than 20 students. There is a student-to-faculty ratio of 12-to-1.

All classes are taught by full-time professors. The college offers 49 majors and 34 minors. The majority of students declare majors in the liberal arts or business. Regardless of major, all undergraduate students are required to complete a core curriculum which includes credits in the Development of Western Civilization, mathematics, philosophy, theology, natural science, English, fine arts, and social science. Beginning with the Class of 2016, the core curriculum was modified to reduce the required credits in natural science and social science, while adding credits in a &quot;core focus&quot; area, as well as proficiencies in intensive writing, oral communication, diversity, and civic engagement.

Constructed in 1969, the Phillips Memorial Library consists of 242,000 volumes and has access to 3.5 million volumes as a member of the HELIN library consortium of Rhode Island.

===Academic divisions===
Providence College comprises four schools: the School of Arts &amp; Sciences, the School of Business, the School of Education and Social Work and the School of Nursing and Health Sciences.

The School of Arts &amp; Sciences was created in 2008 as part of the college&#x27;s addition of a stand-alone School of Business. The school offers undergraduate degrees in social sciences, natural sciences, mathematics, the humanities, and fine arts. It also offers graduate programs with Masters of Arts in history, biblical studies, mathematics, and theology, as well as a Master of Theological Studies degree.

The School of Business was created in 2008 and immediately began the accreditation process for the AACSB. The college&#x27;s successful accreditation was received in 2012. The school offers four undergraduate degrees, in management, finance, accountancy, and marketing and two graduate programs, a Master of Business Administration (MBA) graduate program. and a Master of Science in Business Analytics. The school also offers three graduate certificates in business analytics, digital marketing, and sports management.

Created as a separate school in 2008, the School of Professional Studies includes undergraduate and graduate degree programs in education and special education, social work, and health policy. It also offers a certificate program in special education administration.

The School of Continuing Education offers courses to complete an associate&#x27;s degree or bachelor&#x27;s degree with programs including social sciences, theology, organizational studies, humanities, and liberal studies. In addition, it offers numerous certificate programs, including a Teacher Certification Program (TCP).

===Academic programs===

====Liberal Arts Honors Program====
The Liberal Arts Honors Program was created in 1957 and accepts approximately the top 125 students in each freshman class, offering three levels of academic scholarships for participation in the program. Honors students take separate Development of Western Civilization courses with smaller classes, in addition to one or two honors-level classes in other programs and a capstone honors &quot;colloquium&quot; course.

====Development of Western Civilization====

The Development of Western Civilization (commonly referred to by students as &quot;Civ&quot; or &quot;DWC&quot;) is a two-year-long program of courses required of all students attending the school, taken in students&#x27; first four semesters at the school. Meeting in the Ruane Center for the Humanities, a lecture hall specifically built in 2013 for the program, the class meets three days a week, with one day being typically reserved for seminar work and/or exams. The class is taught by a team of professors, usually three, who specialize in literature, theology, philosophy, or history. Students move through Western history, studying original texts in each of the four course disciplines. The new Development of Western Civilization Program, implemented in late 2012, features three semesters of standard lectures which move chronologically from ancient history to the modern period. The fourth and final semester of the program is organized into various colloquia, specialized courses taught by two professors that are more concentrated to students&#x27; interests and majors.

There is a tradition which has grown over time from the course called &quot;Civ Scream.&quot; The event takes place the night before DWC final exams in December and May, and is usually centered on the &quot;Quad&quot; area between Aquinas, Meagher, and McDermott Halls. It is intended to be a harmless gathering to let off steam from the long hours of studying for the intense course&#x27;s final exam, and is completely unsanctioned. As such, the &quot;Civ Scream&quot; can become loud and rowdy with wild behavior, partying, and streaking.

==Student life==

The Providence College student population is made up of about 3,852 undergraduates and 735 postgraduate students. As of 2012, 58 percent of the student body is female, while 42 percent is male. The student population is drawn mostly from the southern New England states of Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Connecticut, as well as New York, New Jersey, and other Mid-Atlantic states. About one-third of incoming students attended Catholic high schools.

=== Diversity ===
A 2007 survey published by &quot;The Princeton Review&quot; rated Providence College as having the most homogeneous student population in the country, as well as ranking the college eighth nationally in the survey&#x27;s &quot;little race/class interaction&quot; category. As of 2012, 88 percent of the student body is white or unreported, while four percent of students come from outside of the United States. In 2011, President Brian Shanley created an Office of Institutional Diversity, while hiring a Chief diversity officer, to &quot;help balance the College&#x27;s socioeconomic representation.&quot; In 2017, the school topped &quot;The Princeton Review&quot;&#x27;s list of most segregated colleges.

While 95 percent of the student population are residents, 17 percent live in nearby off-campus housing. Parietal rules applying to all undergraduate freshmen limit visitation hours of opposite-sex students in dormitories.

As of 2011, Providence College is ranked first in the country by &quot;The Princeton Review&quot; in the &quot;Lots of Hard Liquor&quot; category.

===Clubs and activities===
Students run the college&#x27;s radio station, WDOM, as well the on-campus television station, PCTV. The station was ranked the 11th-best college radio station in the country by the Princeton Review in 2011. The student-run campus newspaper since 1935 has been &quot;The Cowl.&quot;

The college does not officially sanction Greek life; there are no recognized fraternities or sororities on or off campus. Although there are a few unaffiliated fraternities and sororities that some Providence College students join from surrounding schools such as Brown University and Rhode Island College.

The college&#x27;s oldest club/student organization is Providence College Debate Society. It was founded in 1921 and has had several periods of inactivity and subsequent revival.

==Athletics==
The school&#x27;s 19 varsity men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s sports teams are called the &quot;Friars&quot;, after the Dominican Catholic order that runs the school. They are the only collegiate team to use that team name. All teams participate in the NCAA Division I and in the Big East Conference, except for the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s ice hockey programs, which compete in Hockey East. In 2015, the men&#x27;s hockey team won its first NCAA Division I National Championship.

The team colors are black and white, the same as the Dominicans, with silver as an accent color. The school&#x27;s current logos and identity marks were released in 2002, and feature the profile of a friar wearing the black cappa (hood) of the Dominicans, above the word mark. All teams use the primary logo except the hockey teams, which have used the &quot;skating Friar&quot; logo since 1973. In addition to the Friar mascot, the school&#x27;s animal mascot was a Dalmatian named &quot;Friar Boy.&quot; The school&#x27;s closest rivalries are Boston University and Boston College in hockey and the University of Connecticut and the University of Rhode Island in the school&#x27;s other sports, especially in soccer, tennis, swimming and diving, and basketball. Providence College once had a well-respected intercollegiate football team: two former students played professional football for the New York Football Giants (Charles Avedisian and Hank Soar). The Providence Friars football program was discontinued in 1941.

===Men&#x27;s basketball===
The Friars men&#x27;s basketball team is an original member of the Big East Conference, which was created in 1979 by a group led by former Providence coach Dave Gavitt and headquartered in Providence. The Friars play their home games at the 13,000-seat Amica Mutual Pavilion in downtown Providence, a facility that underwent an $80 million renovation completed in 2008. Despite having the smallest enrollment of any Big East Conference school, the Friars have routinely averaged over 10,000 fans per game during the 30-plus year history of the facility, all while earning postseason berths and placing many players in the National Basketball Association. In addition to producing NBA players, former Friars players and coaches have also gone on to become basketball icons in the coaching world, such as Rick Pitino, Billy Donovan, Lenny Wilkens, Pete Gillen, Rick Barnes, Johnny Egan, and John Thompson. They were coached by Ed Cooley from 2011 to 2023.

Providence College won the 1961 and 1963 NIT championship and participated in the 1973 and 1987 Final Four, and the 1965 and 1997 squads advanced to the NCAA Elite Eight. Overall, the team has earned 19 NCAA basketball tournament berths and 18 NIT berths, as well as having numerous players named All-Americans.

==Marks and seals==
The college&#x27;s graphic identity represents the shape of a window in Harkins Hall with a flame inside, representing &quot;Veritas&quot;, or &quot;Truth&quot;, the official college motto. The college motto was borrowed from the Dominican Order, and has been used since the college&#x27;s inception.

The official seal of Providence College is an ornate triangle, representing the Trinity, with the flame of learning and a scroll with the College Motto, &quot;Veritas&quot;, superimposed on it. The seal is surrounded by a ring with the words &quot;Sigillum Collegii Providentiensis&quot; (&quot;Seal of Providence College&quot;) inside it.

==Notable alumni==

A number of prominent local and national politicians and judges are Providence College alumni. Former United States Senator from Connecticut Chris Dodd graduated in 1966 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English literature, while his father, Thomas J. Dodd, also a long-serving U.S. Senator from Connecticut, graduated in 1930 with a degree in philosophy. Former United States Representative from Rhode Island Patrick J. Kennedy, the son of former United States Senator Ted Kennedy, earned a Bachelor of Science degree in 1991.

In addition, 1963 graduate and star basketball player Raymond Flynn (Class of 1963) earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in education–social studies before serving as a three-term Mayor of Boston and the United States Ambassador to the Holy See. Six-term Mayor of Chicago Richard M. Daley graduated in 1964 from Providence College. Former United States Attorney General, United States Senator from Rhode Island, and Governor of Rhode Island J. Howard McGrath was a 1926 graduate of the college.

In athletics, two Basketball Hall of Fame players or coaches have graduated from Providence College: Lenny Wilkens and John Thompson. In ice hockey, Olympic champion goalie Sara DeCosta, played for Providence as well as current NHL forward Brandon Tanev. In addition, two-time NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament champion, former University of Florida men&#x27;s basketball and current Chicago Bulls head coach Billy Donovan (Class of 1987), graduated from Providence College.
 Former Big East Conference commissioner John Marinatto (Class of 1979) is a Providence College graduate, while former Toronto Maple Leafs general manager Brian Burke (Class of 1977), former New Jersey Devils CEO/President and former Toronto Maple Leafs general manager and current New York Islander general manager Lou Lamoriello (Class of 1963), and Boston Celtics president Rich Gotham (Class of 1986) are also alumni.

Actor John O&#x27;Hurley (Class of 1976), film directors Peter Farrelly (Class of 1979) and James O&#x27;Brien (Class of 1992), actress and comedian Janeane Garofalo (Class of 1986) are graduates of Providence College, as are ESPN NBA and college basketball commentator Doris Burke (Class of 1987), and sports journalist Sean McAdam (Class of 1981).
