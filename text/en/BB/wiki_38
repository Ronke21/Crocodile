<text>The sorites paradox (), sometimes known as the paradox of the heap, is a paradox that results from vague predicates. A typical formulation involves a heap of sand, from which grains are removed individually. With the assumption that removing a single grain does not cause a heap not to be considered a heap anymore, the paradox is to consider what happens when the process is repeated enough times that only one grain remains and if it is still a heap. If not, then the question asks when it changed from a heap to a non-heap.

==Original formulation==
The word &quot;sorites&quot; () derives from the Greek word for &quot;heap&quot; (). The paradox is so named because of its original characterization, attributed to Eubulides of Miletus. The paradox is as follows: consider a of sand from which grains are removed individually. One might construct the argument from the following premises:

:&quot; grains of sand is a heap of sand&quot; (Premise 1)
:&quot;A heap of sand minus one grain is still a heap.&quot; (Premise 2)

Repeated applications of premise 2 (each time starting with one fewer grain) eventually forces one to accept the conclusion that a heap may be composed of just one grain of sand.
Read (1995) observes that &quot;the argument is itself a heap, or sorites, of steps of &quot;modus ponens&quot;&quot;:

:&quot; grains is a heap.&quot;
:&quot;If grains is a heap then grains is a heap.&quot;
:&quot;So grains is a heap.&quot;
:&quot;If grains is a heap then grains is a heap.&quot;
:&quot;So grains is a heap.&quot;
:&quot;If ...&quot;
:&quot;... So grain is a heap.&quot;
One grain of sand is not considered to be a heap of sand. So the argument, although seeming valid and with plausible premises, has a false conclusion, which makes it a paradox, according to a popular (though not universally accepted) academic definition of &quot;paradox&quot;.

==Variations==
There are many variations of the sorites paradox, some of which allow consideration of the difference between &quot;being&quot; and &quot;seeming&quot;, that is, between a question of fact and a question of perception; this may be seen to be relevant when the argument hinges on each change being &quot;imperceptible&quot;.

Another formulation is to start with a grain of sand, which is clearly not a heap, and then assume that adding a single grain of sand to something that is not a heap does not cause it to become a heap. Inductively, this process can be repeated as much as one wants without ever constructing a heap. A more natural formulation of this variant is to assume a set of colored chips exists such that two adjacent chips vary in color too little for human eyesight to be able to distinguish between them. Then by induction on this premise, humans would not be able to distinguish between any colors.

The removal of one drop from the ocean, will not make it &quot;not an ocean&quot; (it is still an ocean), but since the volume of water in the ocean is finite, eventually, after enough removals, even a litre of water left is still an ocean.

This paradox can be reconstructed for a variety of predicates, for example, with &quot;tall&quot;, &quot;rich&quot;, &quot;old&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;bald&quot;, and so on. The version about baldness, where it is argued that adding a single hair does not make a bald man no longer bald, is known as the &quot;falakros&quot;, from the Greek for &quot;bald&quot; (φαλακρός). Bertrand Russell argued that all of natural language, even logical connectives, is vague; moreover, representations of propositions are vague.

==General conditional sorites==
A formal generalization of the paradoxical sorites argument is as follows:

:&quot;formula_1&quot;.
:&quot;If formula_1, then formula_3.&quot;
:&quot;If formula_3, then formula_5.&quot;
:&quot;formula_6&quot;
:&quot;If formula_7, then formula_8.&quot;
:&quot;formula_9&quot; (where formula_10 can be arbitrarily large)
This formalization is in first-order logic, where formula_11 is a predicate and formula_12 are different subjects to which it may be applied; for each subject formula_13, the notation formula_14 signifies the application of the predicate formula_11 to formula_13, i.e., the proposition that &quot;formula_13 is formula_11&quot;. (Jonathan Barnes originally represented each &quot;if formula_8, then formula_20&quot; proposition using the symbol formula_21 for the material implication connective, so his argument originally ended with formula_22.)

Jonathan Barnes has discovered the conditions for an argument of this general form to be soritical. First, the series formula_23 must be ordered; for example, heaps may be ordered according to number of grains of sand in them, or, in the &quot;falakros&quot; version (see ), heads may be ordered according to the number of hairs on them. Second, the predicate formula_11 must be &quot;soritical relative to the series&quot; formula_23, which means: first, that it is, to all appearances, true of formula_26, the first item in the series; second, that it is, to all appearances, false of formula_27, the last item in the series; and third, that all adjacent pairs of subjects in the series, formula_13 and formula_29, are, to all appearances, so similar as to be indiscriminable in respect of formula_11 – that is, it must seem that either both of formula_13 and formula_29 satisfy formula_11, or neither do.

This last condition on the predicate is what Crispin Wright called the predicate&#x27;s &quot;tolerance&quot; of small degrees of change, and which he considered a condition of a predicate&#x27;s being vague. As Wright said, supposing that formula_34 is a concept related to a predicate formula_11 such that &quot;any object which formula_11 characterizes may be changed into one which it does not simply by sufficient change in respect of formula_34&quot;, then &quot;formula_11 is &quot;tolerant&quot; with respect to formula_34 if there is also some positive degree of change in respect of formula_34 insufficient ever to affect the justice with which formula_11 applies to a particular case.&quot;

==Proposed resolutions==
===Denying the existence of heaps===
One may object to the first premise by denying that grains of sand make a heap. But is just an arbitrary large number, and the argument will apply with any such number. So the response must deny outright that there are such things as heaps. Peter Unger defends this solution. However, A. J. Ayer repudiated it when presented with it by Unger: &quot;If we regard everything as being composed of atoms, and think of Unger as consisting not of cells but of the atoms which compose the cells, then, as David Wiggins has pointed out to me, a similar argument could be used to prove that Unger, so far from being non-existent, is identical with everything that there is. We have only to substitute for the premise that the subtraction of one atom from Unger&#x27;s body never makes any difference to his existence the premise that the addition of one atom to it never makes any difference either.&quot;

===Setting a fixed boundary===
A common first response to the paradox is to term any set of grains that has more than a certain number of grains in it a heap. If one were to define the &quot;fixed boundary&quot; at grains then one would claim that for fewer than , it is not a heap; for or more, then it is a heap.

Collins argues that such solutions are unsatisfactory as there seems little significance to the difference between grains and grains. The boundary, wherever it may be set, remains arbitrary, and so its precision is misleading. It is objectionable on both philosophical and linguistic grounds: the former on account of its arbitrariness and the latter on the ground that it is simply not how natural language is used.

===Unknowable boundaries (or epistemicism)===
Timothy Williamson and Roy Sorensen claim that there are fixed boundaries but that they are necessarily unknowable.

===Supervaluationism===
Supervaluationism is a method for dealing with irreferential singular terms and vagueness. It allows one to retain the usual tautological laws even when dealing with undefined truth values.
An example of a proposition about an irreferential singular term is the sentence &quot;&quot;Pegasus likes licorice&quot;.
Since the name &quot;Pegasus&quot; fails to refer, no truth value can be assigned to the sentence; there is nothing in the myth that would justify any such assignment. However, there are some statements about Pegasus which have definite truth values nevertheless, such as &quot;Pegasus likes licorice or Pegasus doesn&#x27;t like licorice&quot;&quot;. This sentence is an instance of the tautology &quot;formula_42&quot;, i.e. the valid schema &quot;&quot;formula_43 or not-formula_43&quot;. According to supervaluationism, it should be true regardless of whether or not its components have a truth value.

By admitting sentences without defined truth values, supervaluationism avoids adjacent cases such that grains of sand is a heap of sand, but grains is not;
for example, &quot; grains of sand is a heap&quot; may be considered a border case having no defined truth value. Nevertheless, supervaluationism is able to handle a sentence like &quot; grains of sand is a heap or grains of sand is not a heap&quot; as a tautology, i.e. to assign it the value &quot;true&quot;.

====Mathematical explanation====
Let formula_45 be a classical valuation defined on every atomic sentence of the language formula_46, and let formula_47 be the number of distinct atomic sentences in formula_48. Then for every sentence formula_48, at most formula_50 distinct classical valuations can exist. A supervaluation formula_51 is a function from sentences to truth values such that, a sentence formula_48 is super-true (i.e. formula_53) if and only if formula_54 for every classical valuation formula_45; likewise for super-false. Otherwise, formula_56 is undefined—i.e. exactly when there are two classical valuations formula_45 and formula_58 such that formula_59 and formula_60.

For example, let formula_61 be the formal translation of &quot;Pegasus likes licorice&quot;&quot;. Then there are exactly two classical valuations formula_45 and formula_58 on formula_61, viz. formula_65 and formula_66. So formula_61 is neither super-true nor super-false. However, the tautology formula_68 is evaluated to formula_69 by every classical valuation; it is hence super-true. Similarly, the formalization of the above heap proposition formula_70 is neither super-true nor super-false, but formula_71 is super-true.

===Truth gaps, gluts, and multi-valued logics===
Another method is to use a multi-valued logic. In this context, the problem is with the principle of bivalence: the sand is either a heap or is not a heap, without any shades of gray. Instead of two logical states, &quot;heap&quot; and &quot;not-heap&quot;, a three value system can be used, for example &quot;heap&quot;, &quot;indeterminate&quot; and &quot;not-heap&quot;. A response to this proposed solution is that three valued systems do not truly resolve the paradox as there is still a dividing line between &quot;heap&quot; and &quot;indeterminate&quot; and also between &quot;indeterminate&quot; and &quot;not-heap&quot;. The third truth-value can be understood either as a &quot;truth-value gap&quot; or as a &quot;truth-value glut&quot;.

Alternatively, fuzzy logic offers a continuous spectrum of logical states represented in the unit interval of real numbers [0,1]—it is a many-valued logic with infinitely-many truth-values, and thus the sand transitions gradually from &quot;definitely heap&quot; to &quot;definitely not heap&quot;, with shades in the intermediate region. Fuzzy hedges are used to divide the continuum into regions corresponding to classes like &quot;definitely heap&quot;, &quot;mostly heap&quot;, &quot;partly heap&quot;, &quot;slightly heap&quot;, and &quot;not heap&quot;. Though the problem remains of where these borders occur; e.g. at what number of grains sand starts being &quot;definitely&quot; a heap.

===Hysteresis===
Another method, introduced by Raffman, is to use hysteresis, that is, knowledge of what the collection of sand started as. Equivalent amounts of sand may be termed heaps or not based on how they got there. If a large heap (indisputably described as a heap) is diminished slowly, it preserves its &quot;heap status&quot; to a point, even as the actual amount of sand is reduced to a smaller number of grains. For example, grains is a pile and grains is a heap. There will be an overlap for these states. So if one is reducing it from a heap to a pile, it is a heap going down until . At that point, one would stop calling it a heap and start calling it a pile. But if one replaces one grain, it would not instantly turn back into a heap. When going up it would remain a pile until grains. The numbers picked are arbitrary; the point is, that the same amount can be either a heap or a pile depending on what it was before the change. A common use of hysteresis would be the thermostat for air conditioning: the AC is set at 77 °F and it then cools the air to just below 77 °F, but does not activate again instantly when the air warms to 77.001 °F—it waits until almost 78 °F, to prevent instant change of state over and over again.

===Group consensus===
One can establish the meaning of the word &quot;heap&quot; by appealing to consensus. Williamson, in his epistemic solution to the paradox, assumes that the meaning of vague terms must be determined by group usage. The consensus method typically claims that a collection of grains is as much a &quot;heap&quot; as the proportion of people in a group who believe it to be so. In other words, the &quot;probability&quot; that any collection is considered a heap is the expected value of the distribution of the group&#x27;s opinion.

A group may decide that:
*One grain of sand on its own is not a heap.
*A large collection of grains of sand is a heap.

Between the two extremes, individual members of the group may disagree with each other over whether any particular collection can be labelled a &quot;heap&quot;. The collection can then not be definitively claimed to &quot;be&quot; a &quot;heap&quot; or &quot;not a heap&quot;. This can be considered an appeal to descriptive linguistics rather than prescriptive linguistics, as it resolves the issue of definition based on how the population uses natural language. Indeed, if a precise prescriptive definition of &quot;heap&quot; is available then the group consensus will always be unanimous and the paradox does not occur.

===Resolutions in utility theory===
In the economics field of utility theory, the sorites paradox arises when a person&#x27;s preferences patterns are investigated.
As an example by Robert Duncan Luce, it is easy to find a person, say, Peggy, who prefers in her coffee 3 grams (that is, 1 cube) of sugar to 15 grams (5 cubes), however, she will usually be indifferent between 3.00 and 3.03 grams, as well as between 3.03 and 3.06 grams, and so on, as well as finally between 14.97 and 15.00 grams.

Two measures were taken by economists to avoid the sorites paradox in such a setting.

* Comparative, rather than positive, forms of properties are used. The above example deliberately does not make a statement like &quot;Peggy likes a cup of coffee with 3 grams of sugar&quot;, or &quot;Peggy does not like a cup of coffee with 15 grams of sugar&quot;. Instead, it states &quot;Peggy likes a cup of coffee with 3 grams of sugar more than one with 15 grams of sugar&quot;.
* Economists distinguish preference (&quot;Peggy likes ... more than ...&quot;) from indifference (&quot;Peggy likes ... as much as ... &quot;), and do not consider the latter relation to be transitive. In the above example, abbreviating &quot;a cup of coffee with x grams of sugar&quot; by &quot;&quot;c&quot;&quot;x&quot;&quot;, and &quot;Peggy is indifferent between &quot;c&quot;&quot;x&quot; and &quot;c&quot;&quot;y&quot;&quot; as the facts and and ... and do not imply 

Several kinds of relations were introduced to describe preference and indifference without running into the sorites paradox.
Luce defined semi-orders and investigated their mathematical properties; 
Amartya Sen performed a similar task for quasitransitive relations.
Abbreviating &quot;Peggy likes &quot;c&quot;&quot;x&quot; more than &quot;c&quot;&quot;y&quot;&quot; as and abbreviating or by it is reasonable that the relation &quot;&gt;&quot; is a semi-order while ≥ is quasitransitive.
Conversely, from a given semi-order &gt; the indifference relation ≈ can be reconstructed by defining if neither nor 
Similarly, from a given quasitransitive relation ≥ the indifference relation ≈ can be reconstructed by defining if both and 
These reconstructed ≈ relations are usually not transitive.

The table to the right shows how the above color example can be modelled as a quasi-transitive relation ≥. Color differences overdone for readability. A color &quot;X&quot; is said to be more or equally red than a color &quot;Y&quot; if the table cell in row &quot;X&quot; and column &quot;Y&quot; is not empty. In that case, if it holds a &quot;≈&quot;, then &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; look indistinguishably equal, and if it holds a &quot;&gt;&quot;, then &quot;X&quot; looks clearly more red than &quot;Y&quot;. The relation ≥ is the disjoint union of the symmetric relation ≈ and the transitive relation &gt;. Using the transitivity of &gt;, the knowledge of both &gt; and &gt; allows one to infer that &gt; . However, since ≥ is not transitive, a &quot;paradoxical&quot; inference like &quot; ≥ and ≥ , hence ≥ &quot; is no longer possible. For the same reason, e.g. &quot; ≈ and ≈ , hence ≈ &quot; is no longer a valid inference. Similarly, to resolve the original heap variation of the paradox with this approach, the relation &quot;&quot;X&quot; grains are more a heap than &quot;Y&quot; grains&quot; could be considered quasitransitive rather than transitive.

==Continuum fallacy==
The continuum fallacy (also known as the fallacy of the beard, line-drawing fallacy, or decision-point fallacy) is an informal fallacy related to the sorites paradox. Both fallacies cause one to erroneously reject a vague claim simply because it is not as precise as one would like it to be. Vagueness alone does not necessarily imply invalidity. The fallacy is the argument that two states or conditions cannot be considered distinct (or do not exist at all) because between them there exists a continuum of states.

Strictly, the sorites paradox refers to situations where there are many &quot;discrete&quot; states (classically between 1 and 1,000,000 grains of sand, hence 1,000,000 possible states), while the continuum fallacy refers to situations where there is (or appears to be) a &quot;continuum&quot; of states, such as temperature.

For the purpose of the continuum fallacy, one assumes that there is in fact a continuum, though this is generally a minor distinction: in general, any argument against the sorites paradox can also be used against the continuum fallacy. One argument against the fallacy is based on the simple counterexample: there do exist bald people and people who are not bald. Another argument is that for each degree of change in states, the degree of the condition changes slightly, and these slight changes build up to shift the state from one category to another. For example, perhaps the addition of a grain of rice causes the total group of rice to be &quot;slightly more&quot; of a heap, and enough slight changes will certify the group&#x27;s heap status – see fuzzy logic.

<doc id="231699" wikidata="Q83321" url="?curid=231699" title="Giacomo Casanova">
<text>Giacomo Girolamo Casanova (; ; 2 April 1725 – 4 June 1798) was an Italian adventurer who was born in the Republic of Venice and travelled extensively throughout Europe. He is chiefly remembered for his autobiography, written in French and published posthumously as (&quot;The Story of My Life&quot;). That work has come to be regarded as a unique and provocative source of information on the customs and norms of European social life in the 18th century.

Born to a family of actors, Casanova studied law at the University of Padua and received minor orders in the Catholic Church with a view towards pursuing a career as a canon lawyer. However, he had no enthusiasm for the law or vocation for the church, and he soon abandoned those plans and launched instead upon an itinerant life as a gambler, violinist, confidence trickster, and man of letters. Throughout his life, Casanova obtained money and other advantages from various aristocratic patrons by pretending to alchemical, cabbalistic, and magical secret knowledge. Among other exploits, Casanova escaped from the &quot;Piombi&quot; prison, to which he had been confined by order of the Venetian Council of Ten for offenses against religion and morals, and later helped convince the authorities of the Kingdom of France to establish a state lottery as a source of revenue.

Casanova, who often misrepresented himself as an aristocrat, used a variety of pseudonyms, including Baron or Count of Farussi (his mother&#x27;s maiden name) and the invented title Chevalier de Seingalt (). After he began writing in French, following his second exile from Venice, he often signed his works as &quot;Jacques Casanova de Seingalt&quot;. In his autobiography, Casanova reports encounters with popes, monarchs, and cardinals, as well as with major intellectual and artistic figures such as Voltaire, Goethe, and Mozart.

The most notorious aspect of Casanova&#x27;s career are his many complicated sexual affairs with women, stretching from his early adolescence to his old age, which he described in detail in his autobiography. As a consequence of this, Casanova&#x27;s name has become a byword for a male seducer and libertine, like &quot;Lothario&quot; or &quot;Don Juan&quot;. He spent his final years in Bohemia, where he served as librarian to the household of Count Waldstein and resided at Dux Castle.

==Biography==

===Youth===
Giacomo Girolamo Casanova was born in Venice in 1725 to actress Zanetta Farussi, wife of actor and dancer Gaetano Casanova. Giacomo was the first of six children, followed by Francesco Giuseppe (1727–1803), Giovanni Battista (1730–1795), Faustina Maddalena (1731–1736), Maria Maddalena Antonia Stella (1732–1800), and Gaetano Alvise (1734–1783).

At the time of Casanova&#x27;s birth, the city of Venice thrived as the pleasure capital of Europe, ruled by political and religious conservatives who tolerated social vices and encouraged tourism. It was a required stop on the Grand Tour, traveled by young men coming of age, especially those belonging to the British aristocracy. The famed Carnival, gambling houses, and beautiful courtesans were powerful drawcards. This environment provided many of his formative experiences.

His grandmother, Marzia Baldissera, cared for him while his mother toured about Europe in the theater. His father died when he was eight. As a child, Casanova suffered nosebleeds and his grandmother sought help from a witch: &quot;Leaving the gondola, we enter a hovel, where we find an old woman sitting on a pallet, with a black cat in her arms and five or six others around her.&quot; Though the unguent applied was ineffective, Casanova was fascinated by the incantation. Perhaps to remedy the nosebleeds (a physician blamed the density of Venice&#x27;s air), Casanova, on his ninth birthday, was sent to a boarding house on the mainland in Padua. For Casanova, the neglect by his parents was a bitter memory. &quot;So they got rid of me,&quot; he proclaimed.

Conditions at the boarding house were appalling, so he appealed to be placed under the care of Gozzi, his primary instructor, who tutored him in academic subjects, as well as the violin. Casanova moved in with the priest and his family and lived there through most of his teenage years. In the Gozzi household, Casanova first came into contact with the opposite sex, when Gozzi&#x27;s younger sister Bettina fondled him at the age of 11. Bettina was &quot;pretty, lighthearted, and a great reader of romances. ... The girl pleased me at once, though I had no idea why. It was she who little by little kindled in my heart the first sparks of a feeling which later became my ruling passion.&quot; Although she subsequently married, Casanova maintained a lifelong attachment to Bettina and the Gozzi family.

Casanova boasts of having demonstrated from early on a quick wit, an intense appetite for knowledge, and a perpetually inquisitive mind. He entered the University of Padua at 12 and graduated at 17, in 1742, with a &quot;laurea&quot; in law (a discipline for which he later declared his &quot;unconquerable aversion&quot;). His guardian&#x27;s hope was that he would become an ecclesiastical lawyer. Casanova had also studied moral philosophy, chemistry, and mathematics, and was keenly interested in medicine. (&quot;I should have been allowed to do as I wished and become a physician, in which profession quackery is even more effective than it is in legal practice.&quot;) He frequently prescribed his own treatments for himself and friends. While attending the university, Casanova began to gamble and quickly got into debt, causing his recall to Venice by his grandmother, but the gambling habit became firmly established.

Back in Venice, Casanova started his clerical law career and was admitted as an after being conferred minor orders by the Patriarch of Venice. He shuttled back and forth to Padua to continue his university studies. By now, he had become something of a dandy—tall and dark, his long hair powdered, scented, and elaborately curled. He quickly ingratiated himself with a patron (something he was to do all his life), 76-year-old Venetian senator Alvise Gasparo Malipiero, the owner of Palazzo Malipiero, close to Casanova&#x27;s home in Venice. Malipiero moved in the best circles and taught young Casanova a great deal about good food and wine, and how to behave in society. However, Casanova was caught dallying with Malipiero&#x27;s intended object of seduction, actress Teresa Imer, and the senator drove both of them from his house. Casanova&#x27;s growing curiosity about women led to his first complete sexual experience, with two sisters, Nanetta and Marton Savorgnan, then 14 and 16, who were distant relatives of the Grimanis. Casanova proclaimed that his life avocation was firmly established by this encounter.

===Early career in Italy and abroad===
Scandals tainted Casanova&#x27;s short church career. After his grandmother&#x27;s death, Casanova entered a seminary for a short while, but soon his indebtedness landed him in prison for the first time. An attempt by his mother to secure him a position with Bishop Bernardo de Bernardis was rejected by Casanova after a very brief trial of conditions in the bishop&#x27;s Calabrian see. Instead, he found employment as a scribe with the powerful Cardinal Acquaviva in Rome. On meeting Pope Benedict XIV, Casanova boldly asked for a dispensation to read the &quot;forbidden books&quot; and from eating fish (which he claimed inflamed his eyes). He also composed love letters for another cardinal. When Casanova became the scapegoat for a scandal involving a local pair of star-crossed lovers, Cardinal Acquaviva dismissed Casanova, thanking him for his sacrifice, but effectively ending his church career.

In search of a new profession, Casanova bought a commission to become a military officer for the Republic of Venice. His first step was to look the part:

He joined a Venetian regiment at Corfu, his stay being broken by a brief trip to Constantinople, ostensibly to deliver a letter from his former master the Cardinal. Finding his advancement too slow and his duty boring, he managed to lose most of his pay playing faro. Casanova soon abandoned his military career and returned to Venice.

At the age of 21, he set out to become a professional gambler, but losing all the money remaining from the sale of his commission, he turned to his old benefactor Alvise Grimani for a job. Casanova thus began his third career, as a violinist in the San Samuele Theater, &quot;a menial journeyman of a sublime art in which, if he who excels is admired, the mediocrity is rightly despised. ... My profession was not a noble one, but I did not care. Calling everything prejudice, I soon acquired all the habits of my degraded fellow musicians.&quot; He and some of his fellows, &quot;often spent our nights roaming through different quarters of the city, thinking up the most scandalous practical jokes and putting them into execution ... we amused ourselves by untying the gondolas moored before private homes, which then drifted with the current&quot;. They also sent midwives and physicians on false calls.

Good fortune came to the rescue when Casanova, unhappy with his lot as a musician, saved the life of a Venetian patrician of the Bragadin family, who had a stroke while riding with Casanova in a gondola after a wedding ball. They immediately stopped to have the senator bled. Then, at the senator&#x27;s palace, a physician bled the senator again and applied an ointment of mercury—an all-purpose but toxic remedy at the time—to the senator&#x27;s chest. This raised his temperature and induced a massive fever, and Bragadin appeared to be choking on his own swollen windpipe. A priest was called as death seemed to be approaching. However, despite protests from the attending physician, Casanova ordered the removal of the ointment and the washing of the senator&#x27;s chest with cool water. The senator recovered from his illness with rest and a sensible diet. Because of his youth and his facile recitation of medical knowledge, the senator and his two bachelor friends thought Casanova wise beyond his years, and concluded that he must be in possession of occult knowledge. As they were cabalists themselves, the senator invited Casanova into his household and became a lifelong patron.

Casanova stated in his memoirs:

For the next three years under the senator&#x27;s patronage, working nominally as a legal assistant, Casanova led the life of a nobleman, dressing magnificently and, as was natural to him, spending most of his time gambling and engaging in amorous pursuits. His patron was exceedingly tolerant, but he warned Casanova that some day he would pay the price; &quot;I made a joke of his dire Prophecies and went my way.&quot; However, not much later, Casanova was forced to leave Venice, due to further scandals. Casanova had dug up a freshly buried corpse to play a practical joke on an enemy and exact revenge, but the victim went into a paralysis, never to recover. In another scandal, a young girl accused him of rape and went to the officials. Casanova denied the rape, claiming that she had duped him. He was later acquitted of the crime for lack of evidence, by which time he had already fled from Venice.

Escaping to Parma, Casanova entered into a three-month affair with a Frenchwoman he named &quot;Henriette&quot;, perhaps the deepest love he ever experienced—a woman who combined beauty, intelligence, and culture. In his words, &quot;They who believe that a woman is incapable of making a man equally happy all the twenty-four hours of the day have never known an Henriette. The joy which flooded my soul was far greater when I conversed with her during the day than when I held her in my arms at night. Having read a great deal and having natural taste, Henriette judged rightly of everything.&quot; She also judged Casanova astutely. As noted Casanovist J. Rives Childs wrote:

===Grand tour===
Crestfallen and despondent, Casanova returned to Venice, and after a good gambling streak, he recovered and set off on a grand tour, reaching Paris in 1750. Along the way, from one town to another, he got into sexual escapades resembling operatic plots. In Lyon, he entered the society of Freemasonry, which appealed to his interest in secret rites and which, for the most part, attracted men of intellect and influence who proved useful in his life, providing valuable contacts and uncensored knowledge. Casanova was also attracted to Rosicrucianism. In Lyons, Casanova became companion and finally took the highest degree of Scottish Rite Master Mason.

Regarding his initiation to the Scottish Rite Freemasonry in Lyon, the &quot;Memoirs&quot; said:

Casanova stayed in Paris for two years, learned the language, spent much time at the theater, and introduced himself to notables. Soon, however, his numerous liaisons were noted by the Paris police, as they were in nearly every city he visited.

In 1752, his brother Francesco and he moved from Paris to Dresden, where his mother and sister Maria Maddalena were living. His new play, , now lost, was performed at the Royal Theatre, where his mother often played in lead roles. He then visited Prague, and Vienna, where the tighter moral atmosphere was not to his liking. He finally returned to Venice in 1753. There, Casanova resumed his escapades, picking up many enemies and gaining the scrutiny of the Venetian inquisitors. His police record became a lengthening list of reported blasphemies, seductions, fights, and public controversy. A state spy, Giovanni Manucci, was employed to draw out Casanova&#x27;s knowledge of cabalism and Freemasonry and to examine his library for forbidden books. Senator Bragadin, in total seriousness this time (being a former inquisitor himself), advised his &quot;son&quot; to leave immediately or face the stiffest consequences.

===Imprisonment and escape===
On 26 July 1755, at age 30, Casanova was arrested for affront to religion and common decency: &quot;The Tribunal, having taken cognizance of the grave faults committed by G. Casanova primarily in public outrages against the holy religion, their Excellencies have caused him to be arrested and imprisoned under the Leads.&quot; &quot;The Leads&quot; was a prison of seven cells on the top floor of the east wing of the Doge&#x27;s Palace, reserved for prisoners of higher status as well as certain types of offenders—such as political prisoners, defrocked or libertine priests or monks, and usurers—and named for the lead plates covering the palace roof. The following 12 September, without a trial and without being informed of the reasons for his arrest and of the sentence, he was sentenced to five years imprisonment.

He was placed in a single-person room with clothing, a pallet bed, table, and armchair in &quot;the worst of all the cells&quot;, where he suffered greatly from the darkness, summer heat, and &quot;millions of fleas&quot;. He was later housed with a series of cellmates. After five months and a personal appeal from Count Bragadin, he was given warm winter bedding and a monthly stipend for books and better food. During exercise walks he was granted in the prison garret, he found a piece of black marble and an iron bar which he smuggled back to his cell; he hid the bar inside his armchair. When he was temporarily without cellmates, he spent two weeks sharpening the bar into a spike on the stone. Then he began to gouge through the wooden floor underneath his bed, knowing that his cell was directly above the Inquisitor&#x27;s chamber. Just three days before his intended escape during a festival, when no officials would be in the chamber below, Casanova was moved to a larger, lighter cell with a view, despite his protests that he was perfectly happy where he was. In his new cell, &quot;I sat in my armchair like a man in a stupor; motionless as a statue, I saw that I had wasted all the efforts I had made, and I could not repent of them. I felt that I had nothing to hope for, and the only relief left to me was not to think of the future.&quot;

Casanova set upon another escape plan. He solicited the help of the prisoner in the adjacent cell, Father Balbi, a renegade priest. The spike, carried to the new cell inside the armchair, was passed to the priest in a folio Bible carried under a heaping plate of pasta by the hoodwinked jailer. The priest made a hole in his ceiling, climbed across and made a hole in the ceiling of Casanova&#x27;s cell. To neutralize his new cellmate, who was a spy, Casanova played on his superstitions and terrorized him into silence. When Balbi broke through to Casanova&#x27;s cell, Casanova lifted himself through the ceiling, leaving behind a note that quoted the 117th Psalm (from the Latin Vulgate): &quot;I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the Lord&quot;.

The spy remained behind, too frightened of the consequences if he were caught escaping with the others. Casanova and Balbi pried their way through the lead plates and onto the sloping roof of the Doge&#x27;s Palace, with a heavy fog swirling. The drop to the nearby canal being too great, Casanova prised open the grate over a dormer window, and broke the window to gain entry. They found a long ladder on the roof, and with the additional use of a bedsheet &quot;rope&quot; that Casanova had prepared, lowered themselves into the room whose floor was below. They rested until morning, changed clothes, then broke a small lock on an exit door and passed into a palace corridor, through galleries and chambers, and down stairs, where, by convincing the guard they had inadvertently been locked into the palace after an official function, they left through a final door. It was 6:00 in the morning and they escaped by gondola. Eventually, Casanova reached Paris, where he arrived on the same day (5 January 1757) that Robert-François Damiens made an attempt on the life of Louis XV. (Casanova would later witness and describe his execution.)

Thirty years later in 1787, Casanova wrote &quot;Story of My Flight&quot;, which was very popular and was reprinted in many languages, and he repeated the tale a little later in his memoirs. Casanova&#x27;s judgment of the exploit is characteristic:

===Return to Paris===
He knew his stay in Paris might be a long one and he proceeded accordingly: &quot;I saw that to accomplish anything I must bring all my physical and moral faculties in play, make the acquaintance of the great and the powerful, exercise strict self-control, and play the chameleon.&quot; Casanova had matured, and this time in Paris, though still depending at times on quick thinking and decisive action, he was more calculating and deliberate. His first task was to find a new patron. He reconnected with his old friend de Bernis, now the Foreign Minister of France. Casanova was advised by his patron to find a means of raising funds for the state as a way to gain instant favor. Casanova promptly became one of the trustees of the first state lottery, and one of its best ticket salesmen. The enterprise earned him a large fortune quickly. With money in hand, he traveled in high circles and undertook new seductions. He duped many socialites with his occultism, particularly the Marquise Jeanne d&#x27;Urfé, using his excellent memory which made him appear to have a sorcerer&#x27;s power of numerology. In Casanova&#x27;s view, &quot;deceiving a fool is an exploit worthy of an intelligent man&quot;.

Casanova claimed to be a Rosicrucian and an alchemist, aptitudes which made him popular with some of the most prominent figures of the era, among them Madame de Pompadour, the Count of Saint-Germain, d&#x27;Alembert, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. So popular was alchemy among the nobles, particularly the search for the &quot;philosopher&#x27;s stone&quot;, that Casanova was highly sought after for his supposed knowledge, and he profited handsomely. He met his match, however, in the Count of Saint-Germain: &quot;This very singular man, born to be the most barefaced of all imposters, declared with impunity, with a casual air, that he was three hundred years old, that he possessed the universal medicine, that he made anything he liked from nature, that he created diamonds.&quot;

De Bernis decided to send Casanova to Dunkirk on his first spying mission. Casanova was paid well for his quick work and this experience prompted one of his few remarks against the and the class on which he was dependent. He remarked in hindsight, &quot;All the French ministers are the same. They lavished money which came out of the other people&#x27;s pockets to enrich their creatures, and they were absolute: The down-trodden people counted for nothing, and, through this, the indebtedness of the State and the confusion of finances were the inevitable results. A Revolution was necessary.&quot;

As the Seven Years&#x27; War began, Casanova was again called to help increase the state treasury. He was entrusted with a mission of selling state bonds in Amsterdam, the Netherlands being the financial center of Europe at the time. He succeeded in selling the bonds at only an 8% discount, and the following year was rich enough to found a silk manufactory with his earnings. The French government even offered him a title and a pension if he would become a French citizen and work on behalf of the finance ministry, but he declined, perhaps because it would frustrate his wanderlust. Casanova had reached his peak of fortune, but could not sustain it. He ran the business poorly, borrowed heavily trying to save it, and spent much of his wealth on constant liaisons with his female workers who were his &quot;harem&quot;.

For his debts, Casanova was imprisoned again, this time at For-l&#x27;Évêque, but was liberated four days afterwards, upon the insistence of the Marquise d&#x27;Urfé. Unfortunately, though he was released, his patron de Bernis was dismissed by Louis XV at that time and Casanova&#x27;s enemies closed in on him. He sold the rest of his belongings and secured another mission to Holland to distance himself from his troubles.

===On the run===
This time, however, his mission failed and he fled to Cologne, then Stuttgart in the spring of 1760, where he lost the rest of his fortune. He was yet again arrested for his debts, but managed to escape to Switzerland. Weary of his wanton life, Casanova visited the monastery of Einsiedeln and considered the simple, scholarly life of a monk. He returned to his hotel to think on the decision, only to encounter a new object of desire, and reverting to his old instincts, all thoughts of a monk&#x27;s life were quickly forgotten. Moving on, he visited Albrecht von Haller and Voltaire, and arrived in Marseille, then Genoa, Florence, Rome, Naples, Modena, and Turin, moving from one sexual romp to another.

In 1760, Casanova started styling himself the Chevalier de Seingalt, a name he was to use increasingly for the rest of his life. On occasion, he would also call himself Count de Farussi (using his mother&#x27;s maiden name) and when Pope Clement XIII presented Casanova with the Papal Order of the Golden Spur, he had an impressive cross and ribbon to display on his chest.

Back in Paris, he set about one of his most outrageous schemes—convincing his old dupe the Marquise d&#x27;Urfé that he could turn her into a young man through occult means. The plan did not yield Casanova the big payoff he had hoped for, and the Marquise d&#x27;Urfé finally lost faith in him.

Casanova traveled to England in 1763, hoping to sell his idea of a state lottery to British officials. He wrote of the English, &quot;the people have a special character, common to the whole nation, which makes them think they are superior to everyone else. It is a belief shared by all nations, each thinking itself the best. And they are all right.&quot; Through his connections, he worked his way up to an audience with George III, using most of the valuables he had stolen from the Marquise d&#x27;Urfé. While working the political angles, he also spent much time in the bedroom, as was his habit. As a means to find females for his pleasure, not being able to speak English, he put an advertisement in the newspaper to let an apartment to the &quot;right&quot; person. He interviewed many young women, choosing one &quot;Mistress Pauline&quot; who suited him well. Soon, he established himself in her apartment and seduced her. These and other liaisons, however, left him weak with venereal disease and he left England impoverished and ill.

He went on to the Austrian Netherlands, recovered, and then for the next three years, traveled all over Europe, covering about by coach over rough roads, and going as far as Moscow and Saint Petersburg (the average daily coach trip being about ). Again, his principal goal was to sell his lottery scheme to other governments and repeat the great success he had with the French government, but a meeting with Frederick the Great bore no fruit and in the surrounding German lands, the same result. Lacking neither connections nor confidence, Casanova went to Russia and met with Catherine the Great, but she flatly turned down the lottery idea.

In 1766, he was expelled from Warsaw following a pistol duel with Colonel Franciszek Ksawery Branicki over an Italian actress, a lady friend of theirs. Both duelists were wounded, Casanova on the left hand. The hand recovered on its own, after Casanova refused the recommendation of doctors that it be amputated. From Warsaw, he traveled to Breslau in the Kingdom of Prussia, then to Dresden, where he contracted yet another venereal infection. He returned to Paris for several months in 1767 and hit the gambling salons, only to be expelled from France by order of Louis XV himself, primarily for Casanova&#x27;s scam involving the Marquise d&#x27;Urfé. Now known across Europe for his reckless behavior, Casanova would have difficulty overcoming his notoriety and gaining any fortune, so he headed for Spain, where he was not as notorious. He tried his usual approach, leaning on well-placed contacts (often Freemasons), wining and dining with nobles of influence, and finally arranging an audience with the local monarch, in this case Charles III. When no doors opened for him, however, he could only roam across Spain, with little to show for it. In Barcelona, he escaped assassination and landed in jail for 6 weeks. His Spanish adventure a failure, he returned to France briefly, then to Italy.

===Return to Venice===
In Rome, Casanova had to prepare a way for his return to Venice. While waiting for supporters to gain him legal entry into Venice, Casanova began his modern Tuscan-Italian translation of the &quot;Iliad&quot;, his &quot;History of the Troubles in Poland&quot;, and a comic play. To ingratiate himself with the Venetian authorities, Casanova did some commercial spying for them. After months without a recall, however, he wrote a letter of appeal directly to the Inquisitors. At last, he received his long-sought permission and burst into tears upon reading &quot;We, Inquisitors of State, for reasons known to us, give Giacomo Casanova a free safe-conduct ... empowering him to come, go, stop, and return, hold communication wheresoever he pleases without let or hindrance. So is our will.&quot; Casanova was permitted to return to Venice in September 1774 after 18 years of exile.

At first, his return to Venice was a cordial one and he was a celebrity. Even the Inquisitors wanted to hear how he had escaped from their prison. Of his three bachelor patrons, however, only Dandolo was still alive and Casanova was invited back to live with him. He received a small stipend from Dandolo and hoped to live from his writings, but that was not enough. He reluctantly became a correspondent again for Venice, paid by piece work, reporting on religion, morals, and commerce, most of it based on gossip and rumor he picked up from social contacts. He was disappointed. No financial opportunities of interest came about and few doors opened for him in society as in the past.

At age 49, the years of reckless living and the thousands of miles of travel had taken their toll. Casanova&#x27;s smallpox scars, sunken cheeks, and hook nose became all the more noticeable. His easygoing manner was now more guarded. Prince Charles de Ligne, a friend (and uncle of his future employer), described him around 1784:

Venice had changed for him. Casanova now had little money for gambling, few willing females worth pursuing, and few acquaintances to enliven his craven, impulsive tendencies. He heard of the death of his mother and, more paining, visited the deathbed of Bettina Gozzi, who had first introduced him to sex and who died in his arms. His &quot;Iliad&quot; was published in three volumes, but to limited subscribers and yielding little money. He got into a published dispute with Voltaire over religion. When he asked, &quot;Suppose that you succeed in destroying superstition. With what will you replace it?&quot; Voltaire shot back, &quot;I like that. When I deliver humanity from a ferocious beast which devours it, can I be asked what I shall put in its place.&quot; From Casanova&#x27;s point of view, if Voltaire had &quot;been a proper philosopher, he would have kept silent on that subject ... the people need to live in ignorance for the general peace of the nation&quot;.

In 1779, Casanova found Francesca, an uneducated seamstress, who became his live-in lover and housekeeper, and who loved him devotedly. Later that year, the Inquisitors put him on the payroll and sent him to investigate commerce between the papal states and Venice. Other publishing and theater ventures failed, primarily from lack of capital. In a downward spiral, Casanova was expelled again from Venice in 1783, after writing a vicious satire poking fun at Venetian nobility. In it, he made his only public statement that Grimani was his true father.

Forced to resume his travels again, Casanova arrived in Paris, and in November 1783 met Benjamin Franklin while attending a presentation on aeronautics and the future of balloon transport. For a while, Casanova served as secretary and pamphleteer to Sebastian Foscarini, Venetian ambassador in Vienna. He also became acquainted with Lorenzo Da Ponte, Mozart&#x27;s librettist, who noted about Casanova, &quot;This singular man never liked to be in the wrong.&quot; Notes by Casanova indicate that he may have made suggestions to Da Ponte concerning the libretto for Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;.

===Final years in Bohemia===
In 1785, after Foscarini died, Casanova began searching for another position. A few months later, he became the librarian to Count Joseph Karl von Waldstein, a chamberlain of the emperor, in the Castle of Dux, Bohemia (now the Czech Republic). The count—himself a Freemason, cabalist, and frequent traveler—had taken to Casanova when they had met a year earlier at Foscarini&#x27;s residence. Although the job offered security and good pay, Casanova describes his last years as boring and frustrating, though it was a productive time for him in writing. His health had deteriorated dramatically, and he found life among peasants to be less than stimulating. He was only able to make occasional visits to Vienna and Dresden for relief. Although Casanova got on well with the count, his employer was a much younger man with his own eccentricities. The count often ignored him at meals and failed to introduce him to important visiting guests. Moreover, Casanova, the testy outsider, was thoroughly disliked by most of the other inhabitants of the Castle of Dux. Casanova&#x27;s only friends seemed to be his fox terriers. In despair, Casanova considered suicide, but instead decided that he must live on to record his memoirs, which he did until his death.

He visited Prague, the capital city and principal cultural center of Bohemia, on many occasions. In October 1787, he met Lorenzo da Ponte, the librettist of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&#x27;s opera &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, in Prague at the time of the opera&#x27;s first production and likely met the composer, as well, at the same time. There is reason to believe that he was also in Prague in 1791 for the coronation of Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II as king of Bohemia, an event that included the first production of Mozart&#x27;s opera . Casanova is known to have drafted dialogue suitable for a Don Juan drama at the time of his visit to Prague in 1787, but none of his verses were ever incorporated into Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;.

In 1797, word arrived that the Republic of Venice had ceased to exist and that Napoleon Bonaparte had seized Casanova&#x27;s home city. It was too late to return home. Casanova died on 4 June 1798 at the age of 73. His last words are said to have been &quot;I have lived as a philosopher and I die as a Christian&quot;. Casanova was buried at Dux (nowadays Duchcov in the Czech Republic), but the location of his grave has been forgotten.

==Memoirs==

The isolation and boredom of Casanova&#x27;s last years enabled him to focus without distractions on his &quot;Histoire de ma vie&quot;, without which his memory would have been considerably diminished, if not blotted out entirely. He began to think about writing his memoirs around 1780 and began in earnest by 1789, as &quot;the only remedy to keep from going mad or dying of grief&quot;. The first draft was completed by July 1792, and he spent the next six years revising it. He puts a happy face on his days of loneliness, writing in his work, &quot;I can find no pleasanter pastime than to converse with myself about my own affairs and to provide a most worthy subject for laughter to my well-bred audience.&quot; His memoirs were still being compiled at the time of his death, his account having reached only the summer of 1774. A letter by him in 1792 states that he was reconsidering his decision to publish them, believing that his story was despicable and he would make enemies by writing the truth about his affairs, but he decided to proceed, using initials instead of actual names and toning down the strongest passages. He wrote in French instead of Italian because &quot;the French language is more widely known than mine&quot;.

The memoirs open with:

Casanova wrote about the purpose of his book:

He also advises his readers that they &quot;will not find all my adventures. I have left out those which would have offended the people who played a part in them, for they would cut a sorry figure in them. Even so, there are those who will sometimes think me too indiscreet; I am sorry for it.&quot; In the final chapter, the text abruptly breaks off with hints at adventures unrecorded: &quot;Three years later I saw her in Padua, where I resumed my acquaintance with her daughter on far more tender terms.&quot;

In their original publication, the memoirs were divided into twelve volumes, and the unabridged English translation by Willard R. Trask runs to more than 3,500 pages. Though his chronology is at times confusing and inaccurate, and many of his tales exaggerated, much of his narrative and many details are corroborated by contemporary writings. He has a good ear for dialogue and writes at length about all classes of society. Casanova, for the most part, is candid about his faults, intentions, and motivations, and shares his successes and failures with good humor. The confession is largely devoid of repentance or remorse. He celebrates the senses with his readers, especially regarding music, food, and women. &quot;I have always liked highly seasoned food. ... As for women, I have always found that the one I was in love with smelled good, and the more copious her sweat the sweeter I found it.&quot; He mentions over 120 sexual/romantic escapades with women and girls, with several veiled references to male lovers as well. He describes his duels and conflicts with scoundrels and officials, his entrapments and his escapes, his schemes and plots, his anguish and his sighs of pleasure. He demonstrates convincingly, &quot;I can say &quot;vixi&quot; (&#x27;I have lived&#x27;).&quot;

The manuscript of Casanova&#x27;s memoirs was held by his relatives until it was sold to F. A. Brockhaus publishers, and first published in heavily abridged versions in German around 1822, then in French. During World War II, the manuscript survived the Allied bombing of Leipzig. The memoirs were heavily pirated through the ages and have been translated into some twenty languages. Not until 1960 was the entire text published in its original language of French. In 2010 the manuscript was acquired by the National Library of France, which has started digitizing it.

==Relationships==
For Casanova, as well as his local contemporaries of the upper class, love and sex tended to be casual and not endowed with the solemnity characteristic of other Romantic literary works of the 19th century. Flirtations, bedroom games, and short-term liaisons were common among nobles who married for social connections rather than love.

Multi-faceted and complex, Casanova&#x27;s personality, as he described it, was dominated by his sensual urges: &quot;Cultivating whatever gave pleasure to my senses was always the chief business of my life; I never found any occupation more important. Feeling that I was born for the sex opposite of mine, I have always loved it and done all that I could to make myself loved by it.&quot; He noted that he sometimes used &quot;assurance caps&quot; to prevent impregnating his mistresses.

Casanova&#x27;s ideal liaison had elements beyond sex, including complicated plots, heroes and villains, and gallant outcomes. In a pattern he often repeated, he would discover an attractive woman in trouble with a brutish or jealous lover (Act I); he would ameliorate her difficulty (Act II); she would show her gratitude; he would seduce her; a short exciting affair would ensue (Act III); feeling a loss of ardor or boredom setting in, he would plead his unworthiness and arrange for her marriage or pairing with a worthy man, then exit the scene (Act IV). As William Bolitho points out in &quot;Twelve Against the Gods&quot;, the secret of Casanova&#x27;s success with women &quot;had nothing more esoteric in it than [offering] what every woman who respects herself must demand: all that he had, all that he was, with (to set off the lack of legality) the dazzling attraction of the lump sum over what is more regularly doled out in a lifetime of installments&quot;. Casanova proclaims, &quot;There is no honest woman with an uncorrupted heart whom a man is not sure of conquering by dint of gratitude. It is one of the surest and shortest means.&quot; Alcohol and violence, for him, were not proper tools of seduction. Instead, attentiveness and small favors should be employed to soften a woman&#x27;s heart, but &quot;a man who makes known his love by words is a fool&quot;. Verbal communication is essential—&quot;without speech, the pleasure of love is diminished by at least two-thirds&quot;—but words of love must be implied, not boldly proclaimed.

Casanova claimed to value intelligence in a woman: &quot;After all, a beautiful woman without a mind of her own leaves her lover with no resource after he had physically enjoyed her charms.&quot; His attitude toward educated women, however, was an unfavorable one: &quot;In a woman learning is out of place; it compromises the essential qualities of her sex ... no scientific discoveries have been made by women ... (which) requires a vigor which the female sex cannot have. But in simple reasoning and in delicacy of feeling we must yield to women.&quot;

Casanova&#x27;s actions can be considered by many in modern times to be predatory, despite his own claims to the contrary (&quot;my guiding principle has been never to direct my attack against novices or those whose prejudices were likely to prove an obstacle&quot;), especially since he frequently targeted young, insecure, or emotionally-exposed women.

==Gambling==
Gambling was a common recreation in the social and political circles in which Casanova moved. In his memoirs, Casanova discusses many forms of 18th-century gambling—including lotteries, faro, basset, piquet, biribi, primero, quinze, and whist—and the passion for it among the nobility and the high clergy. Cheats (known as &quot;correctors of fortune&quot;) were somewhat more tolerated than today in public casinos and in private games for invited players, and seldom caused affront. Most gamblers were on guard against cheaters and their tricks. Scams of all sorts were common, and Casanova was amused by them.

Casanova gambled throughout his adult life, winning and losing large sums. He was tutored by professionals, and he was &quot;instructed in those wise maxims without which games of chance ruin those who participate in them&quot;. He was not above occasionally cheating and at times even teamed with professional gamblers for his own profit. Casanova claims that he was &quot;relaxed and smiling when I lost, and I won without covetousness&quot;. However, when outrageously duped himself, he could act violently, sometimes calling for a duel. Casanova admits that he was not disciplined enough to be a professional gambler: &quot;I had neither prudence enough to leave off when fortune was adverse, nor sufficient control over myself when I had won.&quot; Nor did he like being considered as a professional gambler: &quot;Nothing could ever be adduced by professional gamblers that I was of their infernal clique.&quot; Although Casanova at times used gambling tactically and shrewdly—for making quick money, for flirting, making connections, acting gallantly, or proving himself a gentleman among his social superiors—his practice also could be compulsive and reckless, especially during the euphoria of a new sexual affair. &quot;Why did I gamble when I felt the losses so keenly? What made me gamble was avarice. I loved to spend, and my heart bled when I could not do it with money won at cards.&quot;

==Fame and influence==
Casanova was recognized by his contemporaries as an extraordinary person and a man of far-ranging intellect and curiosity. Casanova has been recognized by posterity as one of the foremost chroniclers of his age. He was a true adventurer, traveling across Europe from end to end in search of fortune, seeking out the most prominent people of his time to help his cause. He was a servant of the establishment and equally decadent as his times, but also a participant in secret societies and a seeker of answers beyond the conventional. He was religious, a devout Catholic, and believed in prayer: &quot;Despair kills; prayer dissipates it; and after praying man trusts and acts.&quot; Along with prayer he also believed in free will and reason, but clearly did not subscribe to the notion that pleasure-seeking would keep him from heaven.

He was, by vocation and avocation, a lawyer, clergyman, military officer, violinist, con man, pimp, gourmand, dancer, businessman, diplomat, spy, politician, medic, mathematician, social philosopher, cabalist, playwright, and writer. He wrote over twenty works, including plays and essays, and many letters. His novel &quot;Icosameron&quot; is an early work of science fiction.

Born of actors, he had a passion for the theater and for an improvised, theatrical life, but with all his talents he frequently succumbed to the quest for pleasure and sex, often avoiding sustained work and established plans, and got himself into trouble when prudent action would have served him better. His true occupation was living largely on his quick wits, steely nerves, luck, social charm, and the money given to him in gratitude and by trickery.

Prince Charles de Ligne, who understood Casanova well, and who knew most of the prominent individuals of the age, thought Casanova the most interesting man he had ever met: &quot;there is nothing in the world of which he is not capable.&quot; Rounding out the portrait, the Prince also stated:

&quot;Casanova&quot;, like &quot;Don Juan&quot;, is a long established term in the English language. According to &quot;Merriam Webster&#x27;s Collegiate Dictionary&quot;, 11th ed., the noun &quot;Casanova&quot; means &quot;Lover; &quot;esp&quot;: a man who is a promiscuous and unscrupulous lover&quot;. The first usage of the term in written English was around 1852. References in culture to Casanova are numerous—in books, films, theater, and music.

<doc id="231703" wikidata="Q8182" url="?curid=231703" title="Rastatt (district)">
<text>Rastatt is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in the west of Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Neighbouring districts are (from north clockwise) Karlsruhe, Calw, Freudenstadt and the Ortenaukreis. To the west it borders the French &quot;département&quot; Bas-Rhin. Rastatt completely surrounds the district-free city Baden-Baden.

==History==
The district was created in 1939 as the successor of the &quot;Oberamt Rastatt&quot; and later the &quot;Großkreis Baden&quot;. In 1973 it was merged with the majority of the neighboring district Bühl, and some small parts of the district Kehl.

==Geography==
The district is located in the Rhine valley. The south-east part, however, is part of the Northern Black Forest. The highest elevation is the Hoher Ochsenkopf.

The county has three small exclaves within the borough of Baden-Baden. The largest of these is home to the Waldenecksee and the smallest is the old .

==Partnerships==
Since 1968 the district has partnership with the Finnish city Vantaa. The partnership with the Italian Provincia di Pesaro e Urbino was started in 1996.
It is twinned with Fano in Italy, New Britain, Connecticut in the USA and also twinned with Woking, England in 2000. It is also twinned with the Czech town from which its Princess came from during the Baroque period and for whom the summer palace was built.

==Coat of arms==
The top-left corner of the coat of arms show a wine ladder, the symbol of the city Rastatt. The grapes in the top-right symbolize the viticulture in the area around Bühl. The red bar on yellow ground in the bottom-right is the symbol of Baden, and the rose in bottom-left is the symbol of the counts of Eberstein.

<doc id="231704" wikidata="Q1585046" url="?curid=231704" title="Hard disk recorder">
<text>A hard disk recorder (HDR) is a system that uses a high-capacity hard disk to record digital audio or digital video. Hard disk recording systems represent an alternative to reel-to-reel audio tape recording and video tape recorders, and provide non-linear editing capabilities unavailable using tape recorders. Audio HDR systems, which can be standalone or computer-based, are typically combined with provisions for digital mixing and processing of the audio signal to produce a digital audio workstation (DAW).

Direct-to-disk recording (DDR) refers to methods which may also use optical disc recording technologies such as DVD, and Compact disc.

==History==
Prior to the 1980s, most recording studios used analog multitrack recorders, typically based on reel-to-reel tape. The first commercial hard disk recording system was the Sample-to-Disk 16-bit, 50 kHz digital recording option for the New England Digital Synclavier II in 1982. Stereo audio was not immediately available due to data input and output limitations on hard drives of that time. The high cost and limited capacity of these solutions limited their use to large professional audio recording studios, and even then, they were usually reserved for specific applications such as film post-production.

With the arrival of the compact disc in 1982, digital recording became a major area of development by equipment makers. Several affordable solutions were released during the late 1980s and early 90s; many of these continued to use tape, either in reels or in more manageable videocassettes. In 1993, iZ Technology Corporation developed RADAR (Random Access Digital Audio Recorder distributed by Otari), designed to replace 24-track tape machines. By the mid-1990s, with the steady decline of hard disk prices and the corresponding increases in capacity and portability, the cost of hard disk recording systems had dropped to the point where they became affordable for even smaller studios. Hard disk systems have since become the preferred method for studio recording.

On January 14, 2004, Engineers from Fairlight, WaveFrame and AMS were awarded Academy Scientific and Technical Awards for the development of hard disk recording technology

==Operation==
One major advantage of recording audio to a hard disk is that it allows for non-linear editing. Audio data can be accessed randomly and therefore can be edited non-destructively, that is, the original material is not changed in any way. Non-linear editing is not inherent to every hard-disk recording system, however. Different manufacturers implement different degrees of this facility.

Hard disk recorders are often combined with a digital mixing console and are an integral part of a digital audio workstation (DAW). In this form, complex tasks can be automated, freeing the audio engineer from performing a final mix in real time.

A personal computer can be used as a hard disk recorder with appropriate software; nowadays this solution is often preferred, as it provides a more flexible interface to the studio engineer. Many studio-grade systems provide external hardware, particularly for the analog-to-digital conversion stages, while less expensive software systems can use the sound card included with any modern computer.

The major constraints on any hard disk recording system are the storage capacity, transfer rate, and processor speed. Some systems use lossy audio compression to minimize the first two factors. This solution is becoming increasingly rare, thanks to rapid increases in hard disk capacity.

==Products==
Stand-alone hard disk recorders are able to record audio or video without requiring a computer. Examples of notable stand-alone hard disk recorders and manufacturers include Alesis, Akai, Fostex, Korg, Mackie, TASCAM, Roland Corporation, Yamaha Pro Audio, RADAR and Zoom HD8 and HD16.

Miniaturization of recording and storage technology for consumer video already allows the non-professional user to directly record home movies to a permanent storage medium like DVD.

DDRs have replaced Magnetic tape based DV, Digital8, 8mm Video Format, VHS and MicroMV video tape recorders.

Professional television studio DDRs video servers are being used to replace video tape recorders (VTR)s and VTR Cart machines, that playout television commercials and TV shows. DAWs are used in professional audio recording studios. Computer software can implement a hard disk recorder function.

==Applications==
Consumer applications include camcorders to high-end tapeless camcorders, digital video recorder (DVR) and set top box models like TiVo and personal computer based recorders. More professional applications include non-linear editing (NLE) systems like Avid Technology video editing systems, recording television productions/filmmaking in the field with professional video cameras in digital cinematography for digital cinema productions. Hard disk recorders are used in professional television studio from small systems able to record 2 hours to large multi-port playout systems supporting hundreds of hours of material.

<text>Sexual desire is an emotion and motivational state characterized by an interest in sexual objects or activities, or by a drive to seek out sexual objects or to engage in sexual activities. It is an aspect of sexuality, which varies significantly from one person to another and also fluctuates depending on circumstances.

It may be the single most common sexual event in human life.

Sexual desire is a subjective feeling state that can be triggered by both internal and external cues, and that may or may not result in overt sexual behaviour. Desire can be aroused through imagination and sexual fantasies, or by perceiving an individual whom one finds attractive. It is also created and amplified through sexual tension, which is caused by sexual desire that has yet to be acted on. Physical manifestations of sexual desire in humans include licking, sucking, tongue protrusion, and puckering and touching the lips.

Desire can be spontaneous or responsive, positive or negative, and can vary in intensity along a spectrum.

== Theoretical perspectives ==
Theorists and researchers employ two frameworks in their understanding of human sexual desire. The first is a biological framework, also known as &quot;sex drive&quot; (or &quot;libido&quot;), in which sexual desire comes from an innate motivational force like an instinct, drive, need, urge, wish, or want. The second is a sociocultural theory in which desire is conceptualized as one factor in a much larger context (e.g., relationships nested within societies, nested within cultures).

=== Biological framework ===
The biological approach views sexual drives as similar to other physical drives, such as hunger. An individual will seek out food—or, in the case of desire, pleasure—in order to reduce or avoid pain. Sex drive can be thought of as a biological need or craving that inspires individuals to seek out and become receptive to sexual experiences and sexual pleasure. Incentive motivation theory exists under this framework and states that the strength of motivation toward sexual activity depends on the strength or immediacy of the stimuli. If satiety is achieved, the strength of the incentive will increase in the future.

Sex drive is strongly tied to biological factors such as &quot;chromosomal and hormonal status, nutritional status, age, and general health&quot;. Sexual desire is the first of four phases of the human sexual response cycle, followed by arousal, orgasm, and resolution. However, while it is part of the response cycle, desire is believed to be distinct from genital sexual arousal. It has also been argued that desire is not a distinct phase in sexual response, but rather something that persists through arousal and orgasm or even longer. Although orgasm might make it difficult for a man to maintain his erection or a woman to continue with vaginal lubrication, sexual desire can persist nevertheless.

=== Sociocultural framework ===
In the sociocultural framework, desire indicates a longing for sexual activity for its own sake and not for any other purpose other than enjoyment, satisfaction, or the release of sexual tension. Sexual desire and activity may be produced to help achieve other means or to gain non-sexual rewards, such as increased closeness and attachment between partners. Under this framework, sexual desire is not an urge, implying that individuals have more conscious control over their desire.

Sociocultural influences may push males and females into gender-specific roles in which social scripts dictate the appropriate feelings and responses to desire. This may lead to frustration if an individual&#x27;s wants remain unfulfilled due to anticipated social consequences. 

Some theorists suggest that the experience of sexual desire may be socially constructed. Others argue that, although sociocultural factors greatly influence desire, they do not play a large role until after biological factors initiate it. Another view is that sexual desire is neither a social construction nor a biological drive. According to James Giles, it is an existential need based on the sense of incompleteness that arises from the experience of being gendered.

Many researchers believe that relying on a single approach to the study of human sexuality is counterproductive, and that the integrations of and interactions among multiple approaches allow for the most comprehensive understanding. Sexual desire can manifest itself in more than one way; it is a &quot;variety of different behaviours, cognitions, and emotions, taken together&quot;.

Levine suggests that sexual desire has three components that link several theoretical perspectives together: 
*Drive: The biological component. This includes anatomy and neuroendocrinology.
*Motivation: The psychological component. This includes personal mental states (mood), interpersonal states (e.g., mutual affection or disagreement), and social context (e.g., relationship status).
*Wish: The cultural component. This includes cultural ideals, values, and rules about sexual expression that are external to the individual.

== Sex differences ==

In early life, usually before puberty, males are quite flexible regarding their preferred sexual incentive, but they later become inflexible. Females, on the other hand, remain flexible throughout their life cycle. This change in sexuality due to variations in situational, cultural, and social factors is called erotic plasticity. Beyond this, very little is known about sexual desire and sexual arousal in prepubescent children, or whether any feelings they may have are comparable to what they will experience as an adult.

Boys typically experience and commence sexual interest and activity before girls do. Men, on average, also have higher sex drives and desire for sexual activity than women do; this is correlated with the finding that men report more lifetime sexual partners, although mathematicians say it is logically impossible for heterosexual men to have more partners on average than heterosexual women. Sex drive is also related to sociosexuality scores: The higher the sex drive, the less restricted the sociosexual orientation (i.e., the willingness to have sex outside of a committed relationship). This is especially the case for women.

Lippa used data from a BBC internet survey to examine cross-cultural patterns in sex differences for three traits: sex drive, sociosexuality, and height. These traits all showed consistent sex differences across nations, although women were found to be more variable than men in their sex drive. On average, male sexual desire is stronger and more frequent than women&#x27;s, and lasts longer into the life cycle. Though women do not experience sexual desire as often as men, when they do, the intensity of the experience is equal to that of men. Societal perceptions of men and women—in addition to perceptions about acceptable sexual behaviour (e.g., men are expected to be more sexual and sometimes insatiable, while women are expected to be more reserved)—may contribute to expressed levels of sexual desire and satisfaction.

DeLamater and Sill found that affect and feelings concerning the importance of sexual activity can affect levels of desire. In their study, women who said that sexual activity was important to the quality of their lives and relationships demonstrated low desire, while women who placed less emphasis on sexual activity in their lives demonstrated high desire. Men presented similar results. These findings were corroborated by Conaglen and Evans, who assessed whether levels of sexual desire influenced emotional responses and cognitive processing of sexual pictorial stimuli. They found that women with lower sexual desire responded to sexual stimuli more quickly in the picture recognition task, but rated the sexual images as less arousing and less pleasant than women with higher sexual desire.

When presented with explicit sexual imagery and stimuli, women can become physically aroused without experiencing psychological desire or arousal. In one study, 97% of women reported having had sexual intercourse without experiencing sexual desire, while only 60% of men reported the same thing. Also, women may form a more significant association between sexual desire and attachment than men.

Women may be more prone to fluctuations in desire due to the many phases and biological changes the female body experiences, such as menstrual cycles, pregnancy, lactation, and menopause. Though these changes are occasionally unnoticeable, women seem to have increased levels of sexual desire during ovulation and decreased levels during menstruation. An abrupt decline in androgen production can cause cessation of sexual thoughts and failure to respond to sexual cues and triggers that would previously have elicited desire. This is seen especially in postmenopausal women who have low levels of testosterone. Doses of testosterone administered transdermally have been found to improve sexual desire and sexual functioning.

Older individuals are less likely to describe themselves as being at the extremes of the sexual desire spectrum. By the time individuals reach middle and old age, there is a natural decline in sexual desire, sexual capacity, and the frequency of sexual behaviour. DeLamater and Sill found that the majority of men and women do not officially report themselves as having low levels of sexual desire until they are 76 years old. Many attribute this decline to partner familiarity, alienation, or preoccupation with nonsexual matters such as social, relational, and health concerns.

== Measuring and assessing ==
Defining sexual desire is a challenge because it can be conceptualized in many ways. Researchers consider the definition used in the American Psychiatric Association&#x27;s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV-TR (DSM-IV-TR), as well as what men and women understand their own desire to be. The lack of agreed-upon parameters for normal versus abnormal levels of sexual desire creates challenges in the measurement of desire and the diagnosis of sexual desire disorders.

Many researchers seek to assess sexual desire by examining self-reported data and observing the frequency of participants&#x27; sexual behaviour. This method can pose a problem because it emphasizes only the behavioural aspects of sexual desire and does not account for cognitive or biological influences that motivate people to seek out and become receptive to sexual opportunities.

Several scales have been developed to measure the factors influencing the development and expression of sexual desire. One is the Sexual Desire Inventory (SDI), a self-administered questionnaire that defines sexual desire as &quot;interest in or wish for sexual activity&quot;. The SDI measures thoughts and experiences. Fourteen questions assess the strength, frequency, and importance of an individual&#x27;s desire for sexual activity with others and by themselves. The scale proposes that desire can be split into two categories: dyadic and solitary desire. Dyadic desire refers to an &quot;interest in or a wish to engage in sexual activity with another person and desire for sharing and intimacy with another&quot;, while solitary desire refers to &quot;an interest in engaging in sexual behaviour by oneself, and may involve a wish to refrain from intimacy and sharing with others&quot;.

The Sexual Interest and Desire Inventory-Female (SIDI-F) was the first validated instrument developed to specifically assess the severity of hypoactive sexual desire disorder and responses to treatment for the disorder in females. The SIDI-F consists of thirteen items that assess a woman&#x27;s satisfaction with her relationship; her recent sexual experiences, both with her partner and alone; her enthusiasm for, desire for, and receptivity to sexual behaviour; distress over her level of desire; and arousal. The scale has a maximum score of 51, with higher scores representing increased levels of sexual functioning.

== Factors affecting ==
Levels of sexual desire may fluctuate over time due to internal and external factors.

=== Social and relationship influences ===

One&#x27;s social situation can refer to the social circumstances of life, their present stage of life, or the state of their romantic relationship. It may also refer to their non-relationship status. Whether people think that their experience of desire or lack of experience is problematic depends on social circumstances such as the presence or absence of a partner. As social beings, many people seek lifetime partners and wish to experience that connection and intimacy. People often consider sexual desire essential to romantic attraction and relationship development. The experience of desire can ebb and flow with time, increasing familiarity with one&#x27;s partner, and changes in relationship dynamics and priorities.

=== Disorders ===
Two sexual desire disorders are listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV-TR (DSM-5-TR):

* Hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) is defined as persistently or recurrently deficient (or absent) sexual fantasies and desire for sexual activity which causes marked distress or interpersonal difficulty. This definition has been criticized for placing too much emphasis on sexual fantasies, which are usually used to supplement arousal. As a result, a group of sexuality researchers and clinicians have proposed the addition of sexual desire/interest disorder (SDID) to the DSM in hopes that it may more accurately encompass concerns experienced by women in particular. SDID is defined as low sexual desire, absent sexual fantasies, and a lack of responsive desire.
* Sexual aversion disorder (SAD) is defined as persistent or recurrent, extreme aversion to and avoidance of all or almost all genital sexual contact with a sexual partner. SAD is considered more severe than HSDD. Some have questioned its placement within the sexual dysfunction category of the DSM and have called for it to be moved to the specific phobia grouping as an anxiety disorder.

Both HSDD and SAD have been found to be more prevalent in females than males; this is especially the case with SAD.

Hypersexual disorder is associated with sexual addiction and sexual compulsivity. According to a proposed revision to the DSM, which would include it in future publications, hypersexual disorder is defined as recurrent and intense sexual fantasies, sexual urges, and sexual behavior where the individual is consumed with excessive sexual desire and repeatedly engages in sexual behaviour in response to dysphoric mood states and stressful life events.

=== Health ===
A serious or chronic illness can have an enormous effect on sexual desire. An individual in poor health may be able to experience desire but not have the motivation or strength to have sex. Chronic disorders like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, arthritis, enlarged prostate (in men), Parkinson&#x27;s disease, cancer, and high blood pressure can negatively affect sexual desire, sexual functioning, and sexual response.

There have been conflicting findings on the effect of diabetes on sexual desire, especially in men. Some studies have found that diabetic men show lower levels of desire than healthy, age-matched counterparts, while others have found no difference.

=== Medications ===
Certain medications can cause changes in the level of sexual desire through nonspecific effects on well-being, energy, and mood. Declining sexual desire has been linked to the use of anti-hypertension medication and many psychiatric medications, including antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine-oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and sedatives. The psychiatric medications that most severely decrease sexual desire are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Higher dosages of these medications are also correlated with a lowering of sexual desire. 

In women, anticoagulants, cardiovascular medications, statins, and anti-hypertension drugs contribute to low levels of desire. However, in men, only anticoagulants and anti-hypertension medications have been found to be related. Oral contraceptives can also lower sexual desire in as many as one in four women who use them. They are known to increase levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) in the body, and high SHBG levels are in turn associated with a decline in desire.

Methamphetamine and other amphetamines increase sexual desire as a result of their effect on motivational salience.

=== Hormones ===
Sexual desire is said to be influenced by androgens in men and by both androgens and estrogens in women.

Many studies associate the sex hormone testosterone with sexual desire. Another hormone thought to influence sexual desire is oxytocin. Exogenous administration of moderate amounts of oxytocin has been found to stimulate females to desire and seek out sexual activity. In women, oxytocin levels are at their highest during sexual activity.

=== Interventions ===
Medical interventions are available for individuals who feel sexually bored, experience performance anxiety, or are unable to orgasm.

For everyday life, a 2013 fact sheet from the Association for Reproductive Health Professionals recommends erotic literature and recalling instances when one felt sexy and sexual.

== Social and religious views ==

Views on sexual desire and how it should be expressed vary significantly among societies and religions. Ideologies range from sexual repression to hedonism.

Laws concerning specific forms of sexual activity, such as homosexual acts and sex outside marriage, vary by geography. In some countries, such as Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Kuwait, Maldives, Morocco, Oman, Mauritania, United Arab Emirates, Sudan, and Yemen, any form of sexual activity outside marriage is illegal.

Some societies have a double standard regarding male and female expressions of desire. Female genital mutilation is practiced in some regions in an attempt to prevent women from acting on their sexual desires.

<text>George Goring, 1st Earl of Norwich (28 April 1585 – 6 January 1663) was an English soldier and politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1621 and 1628 when he was raised to the peerage.

== Biography ==
Goring was the son of George Goring of Hurstpierpoint and Ovingdean, Sussex, and his wife Anne Denny, sister of Edward Denny, 1st Earl of Norwich. He matriculated from Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge in 1600, and may subsequently have spent some time in Flanders. He was knighted in 1608, became a favourite at court and benefitted from successful overseas policy and monopolies granted by King Charles I. In 1621 he was elected Member of Parliament for Lewes. He was made Knight Marshal in 1623. He was re-elected MP for Lewes in, 1624, 1625, 1626 and 1628. In 1628 he was created Baron Goring. He became a privy councillor in 1639 and Vice-Chamberlain of the Household.

One year later the troubles between Charles and his Parliament became acute and Goring devoted his fortune freely to the royal cause; the king in November 1644 recreated for him the title which he created in 1628 for Lord Denny, Earl of Norwich, his uncle, which had just become extinct on his death. He went with Queen Henrietta Maria to the Netherlands in 1642 to raise money for the king, and in the autumn of the next year he was seeking arms and money from Cardinal Mazarin in Paris. His acts were revealed to the parliament in January 1644 by an intercepted letter to Henrietta Maria. He was consequently impeached of high treason but prudently remained abroad until 1647, albeit deprived of his lands and income, when he received a pass from parliament under a pretext of seeking reconciliation.Thus he was able to take a prominent part in the Second Civil War of 1648. He commanded the Kentish levies, which Fairfax dispersed at Maidstone and elsewhere and was forced to surrender unconditionally at Colchester. Norwich&#x27;s refusal to surrender, even after the cause was known to be hopeless and the people of the town begged him to surrender, was considered to be against the rules of war. Two of his commanders were executed after the siege for their part in it. Norwich was condemned to exile in November 1648 by a vote of the House of Commons, but the next month the vote was annulled.

Early in the next year a court formed under John Bradshaw and tried: Norwich, the Duke of Hamilton, Lord Capel, the Earl of Holland and Sir John Owen. Each received a death sentence on 6 March 1649, but petitions for mercy were presented to parliament, and Norwich&#x27;s life was spared by the Speaker&#x27;s casting vote. Shortly after his liberation from prison in May 1649, he joined the exiled court of Charles II who employed him in fruitless negotiations with the duke of Lorraine. He became captain of the king&#x27;s guard at the Restoration, and in consideration of the fortune he had spent or income he had foregone in the king&#x27;s service a pension of 2000 pounds per year was granted him.

Norwich died at Brentford on 6 January 1663.

==Children==
By his wife Mary Nevill (died 1648), daughter of Edward Nevill, 8th Baron Bergavenny and Rachel Lennard, he had four daughters and two sons: George, Lord Goring; and Charles, who fought in the Civil War, succeeded his father in the earldom, and died without heirs in March 1671.

*Lady Elizabeth Goring (d. c. Nov. 1687), who married William Brereton, 2nd Baron Brereton
*Lady Catherine Goring, who married Edward Scott of Scot&#x27;s Hall and had several children whose paternity her husband refused to acknowledge, on the grounds of her notorious infidelity (Prince Rupert was said to be one of her lovers); her son Thomas succeeded to the estates after Edward belatedly acknowledged him as his lawful son. Thomas married in 1663 Caroline Carteret, daughter of Sir George Carteret, 1st Baronet.
*Lady Lucy Goring, who married Sir Drue Deane
*Lady Diana Goring, who married firstly Thomas Covert of Slaugham, Sussex, and secondly George Porter, eldest son of the noted courtier Endymion Porter
*George Goring, Lord Goring (14 Jul 1608 – 25 Jul 1657)
*Charles Goring, 2nd Earl of Norwich (c. 1615 – 3 Mar 1671)

<text>The Communications Security Establishment (CSE; , &quot;CST&quot;), formerly (from 2008-2014) called the Communications Security Establishment Canada (CSEC), is the Government of Canada&#x27;s national cryptologic agency. It is responsible for foreign signals intelligence (SIGINT) and communications security (COMSEC), protecting federal government electronic information and communication networks, and is the technical authority for cyber security and information assurance.

Formally administered under the Department of National Defence (DND), the CSE is now a separate agency under the National Defence portfolio. The CSE is accountable to the Minister of National Defence through its deputy head, the Chief of CSE. The National Defence Minister is in turn accountable to the Cabinet and Parliament. The current Chief of the CSE is Caroline Xavier, who assumed the office on 31 August 2022.

In 2015, the agency built a new headquarters and campus encompassing . The facility totals a little over and is adjacent to CSIS.

==History==
CSE originates from Canada&#x27;s joint military and civilian code-breaking and intelligence efforts during the Second World War.

=== Examination Unit ===
The Examination Unit (XU) was established during the Second World War, in June 1941, as a branch of the National Research Council. It was the first civilian office in Canada solely dedicated to decryption of communications signals; until then, SIGINT was entirely within the purview of the Canadian military, and mostly limited to intercepts.

In March 1942, XU moved next door to Laurier House in Sandy Hill, Ottawa; this location was chosen because they felt it would draw no suspicion to the enemies. In September, the Department of External Affairs established its Special Intelligence Section at XU with the purpose of reviewing decoded SIGINT with other collateral information to produce intelligence summaries.

The original mandate of the Examination Unit was to intercept the communications of Vichy France and Germany. Its mandate later expanded to include interception and decryption of Japanese communications after Japan entered the war. The unit was estimated to have had 50 staff members at any one time. In total 77 people worked there.

By 1945, the disparate SIGINT collection units of the Canadian Navy, Army, and Air Force, were consolidated into the Joint Discrimination Unit (JDU), which was headquartered in Ottawa in the same building as the XU. By the end of the War, the military JDU and the civilian XU were able to coordinate SIGINT collection, analysis, and dissemination so efficiently that it led officials to consider the establishment of peacetime SIGINT operations. In September 1945, U.S. President Harry Truman declared it would be vital to carry out such operations, and Canadian authorities came to the same conclusion in December later that year.

On 13 April 1946, a secret Order in Council allowed for postwar continuation of wartime cryptologic efforts and thus the Communications Branch of the National Research Council of Canada (CBNRC) was founded. This agency would be the predecessor to today&#x27;s Communications Security Establishment (CSE).

=== Communications Branch of the National Research Council ===
Beginning operations on 3 September 1946, the Communications Branch of the National Research Council (CBNRC) was the first peace-time cryptologic agency and was kept secret for much of its beginning. The CBNRC was established through a secret Order in Council signed on 13 April 1946, combining the civilian Examination Unit (XU) and the military Joint Discrimination Unit (JDU) and was located at LaSalle Academy.

With Edward Drake as its first director, the agency worked with intercepted foreign electronic communications, collected largely from the Royal Canadian Signal Corps (RCCS) station at Rockcliffe Airport in Ottawa. CSE also worked with Canadian Forces Station Leitrim (CFS Leitrim; formerly 1 Special Wireless Station till 1949, and Ottawa Wireless Station till 1966), Canada&#x27;s oldest operational signal intelligence (SIGINT) collection station, established by the RCCS in 1941 and located just south of Ottawa. In 1946, the station&#x27;s complement was 75 personnel (compared to its around 2,000 employees in 2013–2014). This unit successfully decrypted, translated, and analyzed these foreign signals, and turned that raw information into useful intelligence reports during the course of the war.

CBNRC finally began domestic COMSEC efforts on 1 January 1947. During the Cold War, the CBNRC was primarily responsible for providing SIGINT data to the Department of National Defence regarding the military operations of the Soviet Union.

In February 1950, R. S. McLaren was appointed the first CBNRC Senior Liaison Officer (CBSLO) to Washington, D.C. In March 1962: CBNRC installed its first IBM supercomputer, costing CA$372k. In December 1964, CBNRC began collaboration on &quot;Canadian ALVIS&quot; (CID 610), the first and only Canadian cipher machine to be mass-produced; based on the British ALVIS (BID 610).

CBNRC and the information it gathered and shared was kept secret for 34 years until 9 January 1974, when CBC Television aired a documentary titled &quot;The Fifth Estate: The Espionage Establishment&quot;. This was the first time that the organization had ever been mentioned in public. This resulted in an outcry in the House of Common and an admission by the Canadian government that the organization existed.

=== Communications Security Establishment ===
In 1975, the CBNRC was transferred to the Department of National Defence (DND) by an Order in Council, and became the Communications Security Establishment. CSE was now publicly known, and had diversified since the Cold War becoming the primary SIGINT resource in Canada.

In 1988, CSE created the Canadian System Security Centre to establish a Canadian computer security standard among other goals. This led to the publication of the Canadian Trusted Computer Product Evaluation Criteria.

Following the September 11 attacks in 2001, Canada&#x27;s &quot;Anti-terrorism Act&quot; (&quot;ATA&quot;) was ratified, receiving royal assent on 18 December 2001. It amended the &quot;National Defence Act&quot; to formally acknowledge and mandate the activities of CSE. It also made amendments to the &quot;Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act&quot;, the &quot;Criminal Code&quot;, and the &quot;Official Secrets Act&quot; (later the &quot;Security of Information Act&quot;).

In early 2008, in line with the Federal Identity Program (FIP) of the Government of Canada, which requires all federal agencies to have the word &quot;Canada&quot; in their name, CSE adopted the applied title Communications Security Establishment Canada (CSEC; , CSTC). Since mid-2014, the organization has used its legal name (Communications Security Establishment) and initials (CSE) on its website and in public statements.

In November 2011, CSE was made an independent agency, though still operating under the National Defence portfolio and constrained by the &quot;National Defence Act&quot;.

In June 2019, the &quot;Communications Security Establishment Act&quot; was passed as part of an omnibus national security bill called the &quot;National Security Act 2017&quot;. Coming into force two months later, in August, the act set out the mandate and powers of CSE. As part of the omnibus bill, oversight of CSE activities was assumed by the newly created National Security and Intelligence Review Agency (NSIRA).

On October 11, 2023, CSE Chief Caroline Xavier said in an interview with CBC News that CSE offices in various cities may be opened to alleviate staffing shortages.

== Insignia ==

CSE uses generic identifiers imposed by the Federal Identity Program. However, CSE is one of several federal departments and agencies (primarily those having law enforcement, security or regulatory functions) that have been granted a badge by the Canadian Heraldic Authority. The badge was granted in 1994, while CSE&#x27;s pennant was first raised in 1996 to mark the organization&#x27;s 50th anniversary.

From the 1990s to the mid 2000s, CSE&#x27;s Information Technology Security program used a logo to identify its products and publications. The triangle represented threats, while the arc symbolized protection.

==Operations==
Unique within Canada&#x27;s security and intelligence community, the Communications Security Establishment employs code-makers and code-breakers (cryptanalysis) to provide the Government of Canada with information technology security (IT Security) and foreign signals intelligence services. CSE also provides technical and operational assistance to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and federal law enforcement and security agencies, including the Canada Border Services Agency and the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority.

===Signal intelligence===
CSE relies on its closest foreign intelligence allies, the US, UK, Australia and New Zealand to share the collection burden and the resulting intelligence yield. Canada is a substantial beneficiary and participant of the collaborative effort within the partnership to collect and report on foreign communications.

During the Cold War, CSE&#x27;s primary client for signals intelligence was National Defence, and its focus was the military operations of the then Soviet Union. Since the end of the Cold War, Government of Canada requirements have evolved to include a wide variety of political, defence, and security issues of interest to a much broader range of client departments.

While these continue to be key intelligence priorities for Government of Canada decision-makers, increasing focus on protecting the safety of Canadians is prompting greater interest in intelligence on transnational issues, including terrorism.

====Code breaking equipment====
CSE code breaking capabilities degraded substantially in the 1960s and 1970s but were upgraded with the acquisition of a Cray X-MP/11 (modified) supercomputer delivered to the Sir Leonard Tilley building in March 1985 and the hiring of code breaking analysts. It was, at the time, the most powerful computer in Canada. In the early 1990s, the Establishment purchased a Floating Point Systems FPS 522-EA supercomputer at a cost of $1,620,371. This machine was upgraded to a Cray S-MP superserver after Cray acquired Floating Point Systems in December 1991 and used the Folklore Operating System supplied by the NSA in the US. These machines are now retired.

Little information is available on the types of computers used by the CSE since then. However, Cray in the US has produced a number of improved supercomputers since then. These include the Cray SX-6, early 2000s, the Cray X1, 2003 (development funded in part by the NSA), Cray XD1, 2004, Cray XT3, Cray XT4, 2006, Cray XMt, 2006 and Cray CX1, 2008. It is possible that some of these models have been used by the CSE and are in use today.

=== Canadian Centre for Cyber Security ===
The Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS or Cyber Centre; ) is the Government of Canada authority responsible for monitoring threats, protecting national critical infrastructure against cyber incidents, and coordinating the national response to any incidents related to cyber security.

As a unit under the Communications Security Establishment (CSE), the agency is Canada&#x27;s computer emergency response team (CSIRT) and the Canadian government&#x27;s computer Incident response team (CIRT).

Officially created on 1 October 2018, CCCS consolidated the existing operational cyber-security units of several federal government organizations, including Public Safety Canada&#x27;s Canadian Cyber Incident Response Centre, Shared Services Canada&#x27;s Security Operations Centre, and the CSE&#x27;s Information Technology Security branch.

====History====
Formerly known as communications security (COMSEC), the CSE&#x27;s Information Technology Security branch grew out of a need to protect sensitive information transmitted by various agencies of the government, especially the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT), Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA), DND, and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP).

The Cyber Centre was developed in response to CSE&#x27;s consultations with Canadians in 2016 which identified various issues pertaining to cyber security in relation to the federal government, including accountability, departmental coordination, and leadership. In February 2018, the federal budget allocated funds for CSE, in collaboration with Public Safety Canada and Shared Services Canada, to launch the Cyber Centre.

Officially created on 1 October 2018, CCCS consolidated the existing operational cyber-security units of several federal government organizations, including the Canadian Cyber Incident Response Centre of Public Safety Canada; the Security Operations Centre of Shared Services Canada; and the Information Technology Security branch of CSE.

Prior to opening, in June 2018, Minister Ralph Goodale appointed Scott Jones the head of the new Centre.

=== Tutte Institute for Mathematics and Computing ===
The Tutte Institute for Mathematics and Computing (TIMC) is a research institute programme of the Government of Canada responsible for conducting classified research in the areas of cryptology and knowledge discovery to support the Canadian Cryptologic Program and its Five-Eyes international partners.

Though officially founded in 2009, TIMC officially opened and formally named in September 2011. Named after cryptanalyst and mathematician William T. Tutte, TIMC is based within CSE&#x27;s Edward Drake Building in Ottawa.

Sponsored and funded by the Communications Security Establishment, the institute is partnered with Institutes for Defence Analyses, CCR Princeton, CCR La Jolla, CCS Bowie, the Heilbronn Institute for Mathematical Research, Carleton University, and the University of Calgary and is working to create partnerships with other research institutes, government agencies and universities.

Researchers Leland McInnes and John Healy at the Tutte Institute developed a technique called Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), originally designed to analyze malware. The algorithm and software of UMAP has since been released by TIMC to the open-source community, and is now being used to answer questions about COVID-19.

== Facilities ==
CSE occupies several buildings in Ottawa, including the Edward Drake Building and, formerly, the Sir Leonard Tilley Building.

CSE moved to the Tilley Building in June 1961. On 26 February 2015, CSE officially inaugurated their headquarters at the new Edward Drake Building, named for Lt. Colonel Edward Drake, a pioneer of the Canadian signals intelligence.

With the rapid expansion in the number of CSE personnel since the 9/11 attack in the US, the CSE has built new facilities. A new CA$1.2 billion facility, encompassing , has been built in the eastern part of Ottawa, immediately west of the headquarters building for the Canadian Security Intelligence Service. Construction began in early 2011 and was completed in 2015.

==Governance and mandate==

=== Legislation ===
In addition to those mentioned below, CSE is bound by all other Canadian laws, including the Criminal Code, the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;, the &quot;Privacy Act&quot;, &quot;Security of Information Act&quot;, and the &quot;Avoiding Complicity in Mistreatment by Foreign Entities Act&quot;.

In December 2001, the Canadian government passed omnibus bill C-36 into law as the &quot;Anti-Terrorism Act&quot;. The Act amended portions of the &quot;National Defence Act&quot; and officially recognized CSE&#x27;s three-part mandate:
* To acquire and use information from the global information infrastructure for the purpose of providing foreign intelligence, in accordance with Government of Canada intelligence priorities.
* To provide advice, guidance and services to help ensure the protection of electronic information and of information infrastructures of importance to the Government of Canada.
* To provide technical and operational assistance to federal law enforcement and security agencies in the performance of their lawful duties.

The &quot;Anti-Terrorism Act&quot; also strengthened CSE&#x27;s capacity to engage in the war on terrorism by providing needed authorities to fulfill its mandate.

In the 2007 Proceedings of the Canadian Senate Standing Committee on National Security and Defence, then-CSE Chief John Adams indicated that the CSE is collecting communications data when he suggested that the legislation was not perfect in regard to interception of information relating to the &quot;envelope.&quot;

==== &quot;Communications Security Establishment Act&quot; ====
In June 2019, the Communications Security Establishment Act (&quot;CSE Act&quot;) was passed, as part of the &quot;National Security Act 2017&quot;. The Act, which came into force two months after passing, notes that there are five aspects of CSE&#x27;s mandate:
*The acquisition of foreign intelligence (SIGINT)
*Cybersecurity and information assurance to help protect electronic information and information infrastructures of the Canadian government and those designated to be of importance to the government
*Defensive cyber operations
*Active cyber operations
*Technical and operational assistance to federal law enforcement and security agencies, the Canadian Forces, and the Department of National Defence.

The &quot;CSE Act&quot; requires that CSE activities do not target Canadians anywhere in the world, or any person in Canada, &quot;unless there are reasons to believe that there is an imminent danger of death or serious bodily harm. The Act also requires the CSE protect the privacy of Canadians and persons in Canada. As such, CSE is forbidden, by law, to intercept domestic communications. When intercepting communications between a domestic and foreign source, the domestic communications are destroyed or otherwise ignored. (After the September 11 attacks on the United States in 2001, however, CSE&#x27;s powers expanded to allow the interception of foreign communications that begin or end in Canada, as long as the other party is outside the border and ministerial authorization is issued specifically for this case and purpose.)

===Governance and oversight===
The Minister of National Defence guides and authorizes the activities of CSE using ministerial directives, ministerial authorizations, and ministerial orders, all of which are based on the &quot;government’s intelligence priorities as set out by Cabinet through discussion and consultations with the security and intelligence community.&quot; The Defence Minister cannot authorize any activities that are not included in the CSE mandate or grant CSE any powers that do not exist in Canadian law.

Ministerial directives are how the Minister of National Defence instructs the Chief of CSE.

CSE operates under a system of independent oversight:

* National Security and Intelligence Review Agency (NSIRA) – NSIRA is fully independent of government and of CSE. Its committee members are appointed by the sitting Prime Minister in consultation with Parliamentary leaders, and handle complaints against all Canadian national security agencies.
* Intelligence Commissioner – the Intelligence Commissioner is independent of CSE and has oversight of all national security and intelligence gathering activities of the Government of Canada, including CSE. The Commissioner issues an annual report to the Prime Minister, who must table it in Parliament after removing confidential and classified information. The Commissioner is entitled to receive all reports that are compiled by NSIRA.
* National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians (NSICOP) – NSICOP is a committee of Parliamentarians that have the security clearances to review and report on any aspect of CSE&#x27;s activities.

CSE activities are also subject to several external oversight and review bodies.

As with any other federal department or agency of Canada, the activities of CSE are also subject to review by various federal bodies, including:

* the Privacy Commissioner
* the Information Commissioner
* the Auditor General
* the Canadian Human Rights Commission
* the Commissioner of Official Languages

====Heads of the CSE====
====Communications Security Establishment Commissioner====
Oversight over CSE was formerly provided by the Office of the Communications Security Establishment Commissioner (OCSEC; , BCCST), which was created on 19 June 1996 to review CSE&#x27;s activities for compliance with the applicable legislation, accept and investigate complaints regarding the lawfulness of the agency&#x27;s activities, and to perform special duties under the &#x27;Public Interest Defence&#x27; clause of the &quot;Security of Information Act&quot;. The Commissioner provided an annual public report on his activities and findings to Parliament, through the Minister of National Defence.

Between 1996 and 2019, there were six Commissioners:
* Claude Bisson (1996 June 19 – 2003)
* Antonio Lamer (2003 June 19 – 2006)
* Charles Gonthier (2006 August 1 – 2009)
* Peter Cory (2009 December 14 – 2010)
* Robert Décary (2010 June 18 – 2013)
* Jean-Pierre Plouffe (2013–2019)

As part of an omnibus national security bill (the &quot;National Security Act 2017)&quot; passed by Parliament in 2019, the OCSEC was abolished and its responsibilities divided between two newly created entities: employees of the OCSEC were transferred to the Office of the Intelligence Commissioner; and the review functions of the former OCSEC were assumed by the National Security and Intelligence Review Agency (NSIRA).

The previous Commissioner of CSE, Jean-Pierre Plouffe, was appointed to the role of Intelligence Commissioner on 18 July 2019.

==ECHELON==
Under the 1948 UKUSA agreement, CSE&#x27;s intelligence is shared with the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD), and New Zealand&#x27;s Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB).

Along with these services from the United States, the UK, New Zealand, and Australia, CSE is believed to form the ECHELON system. Its capabilities are suspected to include the ability to monitor a large proportion of the world&#x27;s transmitted civilian telephone, fax and data traffic. The intercepted data, or &quot;dictionaries&quot; are &quot;reported linked together through a high-powered array of computers known as &#x27;Platform&#x27;.&quot;

==Controversies==
CBNRC and the information it gathered and shared was kept secret for 34 years until 9 January 1974, when the CBC Television documentary show, &quot;The Fifth Estate&quot;, aired an episode focused on the organization, with research by James Dubro. This was the first time that the organization had ever been mentioned in public. This resulted in an outcry in the House of Commons and an admission by the Canadian government that the organization existed.

A former employee of the organization, Mike Frost, claimed in a 1994 book, &quot;Spyworld&quot;, that the agency eavesdropped on Margaret Trudeau to find out if she smoked marijuana and that CSE had monitored two of former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s dissenting cabinet ministers in London on behalf of the UK&#x27;s secret service.

In 1996, it was suggested that CSE had monitored all communications between National Defence Headquarters and Somalia, and were withholding information from the Somalia Inquiry into the killing of two unarmed Somalis by Canadian soldiers.

In 2006, CTV Montreal&#x27;s program &quot;On Your Side&quot; conducted a three-part documentary on CSE naming it &quot;Canada&#x27;s most secretive spy agency&quot; and that &quot;this ultra-secret agency has now become very powerful,&quot; conducting surveillance by monitoring phone calls, e-mails, chat groups, radio, microwave, and satellite.

In 2007, former Ontario lieutenant-governor, James Bartleman, testified at the Air India Inquiry on May 3 that he saw a CSE communications intercept warning of the June 22, 1985 bombing of Air India Flight 182 before it occurred. Two former CSE employees have since testified that no CSE report was ever produced.

In 2013, a coalition of civil liberties associations launched a campaign directed against the government&#x27;s perceived lack of transparency on issues related to the agency, demanding more information on its purported domestic surveillance activities.

Further criticism has arisen surrounding the construction costs of the agency&#x27;s new headquarters in Ottawa. The project is slated to cost over CA$1.1 billion, making it the most expensive government building in Canadian history.

In 2014, a leaked, top-secret presentation entitled “IP Profiling Analytics &amp; Mission Impacts” summarized experiments tracking the cellphones of travellers passing through Toronto Pearson International Airport. Critics argued that the experiment was invasive and indiscriminate, while CSE countered that it was consistent with all relevant laws and mandates.

In 2016, the CSE Commissioner found that one of the agency&#x27;s metadata activities did not comply with the law. Specifically, CSE had failed to properly minimize certain Canadian identity information before sending it to foreign governments, contravening parts of the &quot;National Defence Act&quot; and the &quot;Privacy Act&quot;.

===Media portrayal===
In &quot;The Good Wife&quot; episode &quot;Landing,&quot; both the NSA and the CSE are shown monitoring personal phone calls and hacking private cell phones&#x27; recording devices in order to listen in on personal conversations. One plaintiff describes the CSE as &quot;the Canadian version of the NSA.&quot;

<doc id="231715" wikidata="Q248255" url="?curid=231715" title="Melisma">
<text>Melisma (, , ; from , plural: &quot;melismata&quot;) is the singing of a single syllable of text while moving between several different notes in succession. Music sung in this style is referred to as &quot;melismatic&quot;, as opposed to syllabic, in which each syllable of text is matched to a single note. An informal term for melisma is a vocal run. The term roulade is also sometimes used interchangeably with melisma. 

==History==

===General===
The term &quot;melisma&quot; may be used to describe music of any genre, including baroque singing, opera, and later gospel. Within the tradition of Religious Jewish music, melisma is still commonly used in the chanting of Torah, readings from the Prophets, and in the body of a service.

Today, melisma is commonly used in Middle Eastern, African, and African American music, Irish sean nós singing, and flamenco. African music infused the blues with melisma. Due to the influences of African-American music, melisma is also commonly featured in Western popular music. Gaelic music&#x27;s use of melisma commonly appears in early Appalachian music and has been a constant feature of American country and western music since its inception.

===Prevalence in western popular music===
The use of melisma is a common feature of artists such as Deniece Williams, Stevie Wonder, Luther Vandross, Whitney Houston, Céline Dion, Mariah Carey, Christina Aguilera, Brandy, Beyoncé, among others. The use of melismatic vocals in pop music slowly grew in the 1980s. In the following two decades, melismatic vocals became the standard used to judge a singer’s skill. This is partially why singers who are proficient in this singing style consistently make the lists of best singers of all time. Deniece Williams topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart in May 1984, with &quot;Let&#x27;s Hear It for the Boy&quot; with her melismatic vocals. Although other artists used melisma before, Houston&#x27;s rendition of Dolly Parton&#x27;s ballad &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; pushed the technique into the mainstream in the 1990s. The trend in R&amp;B singers is considered to have been popularized by Mariah Carey&#x27;s song &quot;Vision of Love&quot;, which was released and topped the U.S. charts in 1990, and went on to be certified gold.

As late as 2007, melismatic singers such as Leona Lewis were still scoring big hits, but around 2008–2009, this trend reverted to how it was prior to Carey, Dion, and Houston&#x27;s success – singers with less showy styles such as Kesha and Cheryl Cole began to outsell new releases by Carey and Christina Aguilera, ending nearly two decades of the style&#x27;s dominance of pop-music vocals.

==Examples==

The traditional French carol tune to which the hymn &quot;Angels We Have Heard on High&quot; is usually sung (and &quot;Angels from the Realms of Glory&quot; in Great Britain), contains one of the most well known melismatic sequences in Christian hymn music. Twice in its refrain, the &quot;o&quot; of the word &quot;Gloria&quot; is held through 16 different notes.

George Frideric Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot; contains numerous examples of melisma, as in the following excerpt from the chorus &quot;For Unto Us a Child Is Born&quot; (Part I, No. 12). The soprano and alto lines engage in a 57-note melisma on the word &quot;born&quot;.

<doc id="231716" wikidata="Q1476462" url="?curid=231716" title="The BFG">
<text>The BFG (short for The Big Friendly Giant) is a 1982 children&#x27;s novel by British author Roald Dahl. It is an expansion of a short story from Dahl&#x27;s 1975 novel &quot;Danny, the Champion of the World&quot;. The book is dedicated to Dahl&#x27;s oldest daughter, Olivia, who had died of measles encephalitis at the age of seven in 1962.

An animated adaptation was released in 1989 with David Jason providing the voice of the BFG and Amanda Root as the voice of Sophie. It has also been adapted as a theatre performance. A theatrical Disney live-action adaptation directed by Steven Spielberg was released in 2016.

As of 2009, the novel has sold 37 million copies, with more than one million copies sold around the world yearly. In 2003, &quot;The BFG&quot; was listed at number 56 in &quot;The Big Read&quot;, a BBC survey of the British public. In 2012, the novel was ranked number 88 among all-time best children&#x27;s novels in a survey published by &quot;School Library Journal&quot;, a US monthly. That same year, the BFG and Sophie appeared on Royal Mail commemorative postage stamps.

==Plot==
Sophie, an young girl in an orphanage, cannot sleep. Looking out of her window, she sees a mysterious Giant Man in the street, carrying a suitcase and a trumpet. The giant sees Sophie, who tries to hide in bed, but the giant picks her up through the window. Sophie is carried to a large cave in the middle of a desolate land, where the giant sets her down. Believing that he intends to eat her, Sophie pleads for her life, but the giant laughs and dismisses the idea. He explains that although most giants do eat humans, he does not because he is the Big Friendly Giant, or BFG; he had carried Sophie off merely so she would not reveal that she had seen a real giant, which would put him at risk of being captured for a zoo-exhibit.

The BFG explains, in a unique and messy speech, that his nine neighbours are much bigger and stronger giants, who all happily eat humans every night. They vary their choice of destination both to avoid detection and because the humans&#x27; origins affect their taste. For example, people from Greece taste greasy, so no giant goes there, while people from Panama taste like hats. As he will never allow Sophie to leave in case she tells anyone of his existence, the BFG reveals the purpose of his suitcase and trumpet: he catches dreams in Dream Country, collects them in jars, and gives the good ones to children all around the world, but destroys the bad ones. Since he does not eat people, he must eat the only crop which grows on his land —-- the repulsive snozzcumber, which looks like a cucumber.

When the Bloodbottler, one of the other giants, enters the cave uninvited, Sophie hides in the snozzcumber; not knowing this, the BFG, in the hope that its revolting taste will drive the Bloodbottler away and thus prevent him from discovering Sophie, tricks the Bloodbottler into eating the vegetable. The Bloodbottler takes a bite of the snozzcumber; unknowingly putting Sophie in his mouth. Luckily, the larger giant spits her out unnoticed and leaves in disgust, much to the BFG&#x27;s and Sophie&#x27;s relief. They then drink frobscottle, a delicious fizzy drink where the bubbles sink downwards rather than upwards, causing powerful and noisy flatulence, which the BFG calls &quot;whizzpopping&quot;.

The BFG takes Sophie to Dream Country but is bullied along the way by his neighbors, led by Fleshlumpeater, the largest and strongest. Sophie watches the BFG catch two dreams—while one would be a good dream, the other is a nightmare. Resentful of the other giants&#x27; mistreatment of him earlier that day, the BFG sneaks up to where they are napping and looses the nightmare on Fleshlumpeater, who has a dream about a giant killer named Jack and accidentally starts a brawl with his companions due to his indiscriminate flailing and thrashing about while still asleep.

Sophie persuades the BFG to approach the Queen of England for help with the other giants. She navigates the giant to Buckingham Palace, where he places Sophie in the Queen&#x27;s bedroom. He then gives the Queen a nightmare that closely parallels actual events; because the BFG setting Sophie in her bedroom was part of the dream, the Queen believes her and speaks with the giant over breakfast. Fully convinced, she authorizes a task force to travel to the giants&#x27; homeland and secure them as they sleep.

The BFG guides a fleet of helicopters to the sleeping giants. Eight are successfully shackled, but the Fleshlumpeater awakes; Sophie and the BFG trick him into being tied up. Having collected the BFG&#x27;s dream collection, the helicopters carry all nine giants back to England, where they are imprisoned in a massive pit.

Every country that the giants had visited in the past sends thanks and gifts to the BFG and Sophie, for whom residences are built in Windsor Great Park. Tourists come in huge numbers to watch the giants in the pit, who are only fed snozzcumbers (although they receive an unexpected welcome snack when three drunks manage to climb the safety fence one night and fall in). The BFG receives the official title of Royal Dream-Blower, and continues bestowing dreams upon children; he also learns to speak and write more intelligibly, writing a book identified as the novel itself, under another&#x27;s name.

==Characters==
* Sophie: The imaginative, creative, nearsighted and kind-hearted protagonist of the story who becomes a brave international heroine. Named after Dahl&#x27;s first grandchild, Sophie Dahl. Voiced by Amanda Root in the 1989 film and portrayed by Ruby Barnhill in the 2016 film.
* The BFG: A friendly 24-foot-tall giant who has superhuman hearing and immense speed. His primary occupation is the collection and distribution of good dreams to children. He also appears in another novel, &quot;Danny, the Champion of the World&quot;, in which he is introduced as a folkloric character. His name is an initialism of &#x27;Big Friendly Giant&#x27;. Voiced by David Jason in the 1989 film and motion-captured by Mark Rylance in the 2016 film.
* The Queen: The British monarch. Firm, bold, and ladylike, she plays an important role in helping Sophie and the BFG. Voiced by Angela Thorne in the 1989 film and portrayed by Penelope Wilton in the 2016 film.
* Mary: The Queen&#x27;s maid. Voiced by Mollie Sugden in the 1989 film and portrayed by Rebecca Hall in the 2016 film.
* Mr. Tibbs: The Queen&#x27;s butler. Voiced by Frank Thornton in the 1989 film and portrayed by Rafe Spall in the 2016 film.
* Mrs. Clonkers: The unseen director of the orphanage in which Sophie lives at the start of the novel; described as cruel to her charges. Voiced by Myfanwy Talog in the 1989 film and portrayed by Marilyn Norry in the 2016 film.
* The Heads of the Army and the Air Force: Two officers answering to the Queen. Voiced by Michael Knowles and Ballard Berkeley in the 1989 film and portrayed by Chris Shields and Matt Frewer in the 2016 film.
* Nine Man-Eating Giants: Each man-eating giant is about 50-feet-tall and proportionately broad and powerful. Their only clothes are skirt-like coverings around their waists. According to the BFG, the flavours of the humans that the man-eating giants dine on depends on their country of origin: Turks taste like turkey, Greeks are too greasy (and hence apparently no giant ever visits that country), people from Panama taste like hats, the Welsh taste like fish, people from Jersey taste like cardigans, and the Danes taste like dogs.
** The Fleshlumpeater: The leader of the nine man-eating giants and the largest and most horrible of the bunch. He shows no mercy for eating so many humans over the years, and is happy with what he has done and would continue it if he could. Voiced by Don Henderson in the 1989 film and motion-captured by Jemaine Clement in the 2016 film.
** The Bloodbottler: Second-in-command to the Fleshlumpeater and also the smartest of the bunch. He has a fondness for the taste of human blood. Voiced by Don Henderson in the 1989 film and motion-captured by Bill Hader in the 2016 film.
** The Manhugger: One of the nine man-eating giants. Motion-captured by Adam Godley in the 2016 film.
** The Meatdripper: One of the nine man-eating giants. He pretends to be a tree in a park so that he can pick off the humans that go under him or families that stop to have a picnic underneath him. Motion-captured by Paul Moniz de Sa in the 2016 film.
** The Childchewer: One of the nine man-eating giants. He is best friends with the Meatdripper and, true to the name, he enjoys the taste of children the most of all. Motion-captured by Jonathan Holmes in the 2016 film.
** The Butcher Boy: The youngest of the nine man-eating giants. Motion-captured by Michael Adamthwaite in the 2016 film.
** The Maidmasher: One of the nine man-eating giants. The name suggests he mashes maidens, but further details are never provided. Motion-captured by Ólafur Darri Ólafsson in the 2016 film.
** The Bonecruncher: One of the nine man-eating giants. He crunches up two humans for dinner every night and especially enjoys eating people from Turkey, making him the picky eater of the bunch, although he will go to other countries such as joining the other eight in a trip to England. Motion-captured by Daniel Bacon in the 2016 film.
** The Gizzardgulper: The shortest of the nine man-eating giants. He often lies above the rooftops of the cities to grab people walking down the streets. Motion-captured by Chris Gibbs in the 2016 film.
==2023 censorship controversy==

Despite Roald Dahl having enjoined his publishers not to &quot;so much as change a single comma in one of my books&quot;, in February 2023 Puffin Books, a division of Penguin Books, announced it would be re-writing portions of many of Dahl&#x27;s children&#x27;s novels, changing the language to, in the publisher&#x27;s words, &quot;ensure that it can continue to be enjoyed by all today.&quot; The decision was met with sharp criticism from groups and public figures including authors Salman Rushdie and Christopher Paolini, British prime minister Rishi Sunak, Queen Camilla, Kemi Badenoch, PEN America, and Brian Cox. Dahl&#x27;s publishers in the United States, France, and the Netherlands announced they had declined to incorporate the changes.

In &quot;The BFG&quot;, more than eighty changes were made, including changing or removing references to colour in people (such as changing &quot;Something very tall and very black and very thin&quot; to &quot;Something very tall and very dark and very thin&quot;, &quot;the flashing black eyes&quot; to &quot;the flashing eyes&quot;, &quot;their skins were burnt brown by the sun&quot; to &quot;their skins were burnt by the sun&quot;, &quot;white as a sheet&quot; to &quot;still as a statue&quot;, and removing &quot;His skin was reddish-brown&quot;), changing &quot;mother and father&quot; to &quot;parents&quot; and &quot;boys and girls&quot; to &quot;children&quot;, and changing &quot;Esquimo&quot; to &quot;Inuit&quot;, &quot;Sultan of Baghdad&quot; to &quot;Mayor of Baghdad&quot;, and &quot;man-eating giants&quot; to &quot;human-eating giants&quot;.

==References in other Roald Dahl books==
The BFG first appears as a story told to Danny by his father in &quot;Danny, the Champion of the World&quot;. The ending is almost the same as &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot;, when he writes a story about himself, by himself. Also, Mr. Tibbs relates to Mrs. Tibbs, the friend of Mr. Gilligrass, the U.S. president in &quot;Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator&quot;.

==Awards and recognition==
&quot;The BFG&quot; has won numerous awards including the 1985 Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis as the year&#x27;s best children&#x27;s book, in its German translation &quot;Sophiechen und der Riese&quot; and the 1991 Read Alone and Read Aloud BILBY Awards from the Children&#x27;s Book Council of Australia.

In 2003 it was ranked number 56 in The Big Read, a two-stage survey of the British public by the BBC to determine the &quot;Nation&#x27;s Best-loved Novel&quot;. The U.S. National Education Association listed &quot;The BFG&quot; among the &quot;Teachers&#x27; Top 100 Books for Children&quot; based on a 2007 online poll. In 2012, it was ranked number 88 among all-time children&#x27;s novels in a survey published by &quot;School Library Journal&quot;, a monthly with primarily U.S. audience. It was the fourth of four books by Dahl among the Top 100, more than any other writer. In 2023, the novel was ranked by BBC at no. 41 in their poll of &quot;The 100 greatest children&#x27;s books of all time&quot;.

<doc id="231718" wikidata="Q298559" url="?curid=231718" title="Johnny Logan (singer)">
<text>Seán Patrick Michael Sherrard (born 13 May 1954), also known professionally as Johnny Logan, is an Australian-born Irish singer, songwriter and musician. He is known for being the first of only two performers to win the Eurovision Song Contest as a lead singer twice. 

Logan won the Eurovision Song Contest in 1980 with the song &quot;What&#x27;s Another Year&quot;, which topped the charts in eight countries. He won for a second time in 1987 with the song &quot;Hold Me Now&quot;, which topped the charts in Israel, Ireland and Belgium and was a top ten hit in ten other music markets. For 36 years he was only solo artist to have won the contest twice, until Loreen&#x27;s second victory in 2023. 

Logan has also composed two Eurovision songs for Linda Martin, &quot;Terminal 3&quot; in 1984 and &quot;Why Me?&quot; in 1992. The former placed second, while the latter came first; therefore making Logan one of only five people to have composed two winning Eurovision entries.

==Early life==
Johnny Logan was born Seán Patrick Michael Sherrard on 13 May 1954 in Frankston, Victoria. His father, Charles Alphonsus Sherrard, was a Derry-born Irish tenor better known as Patrick O&#x27;Hagan, and happened to be touring Australia at the time of Logan&#x27;s birth. The family moved back to Ireland when Logan was three years old. He settled in Howth, Co. Dublin and learnt the guitar and began composing his own songs by the age of 13. On leaving school, he apprenticed as an electrician while performing in pubs and cabaret acts. His earliest claim to fame was starring as Adam in the 1977 Irish musical &quot;Adam and Eve&quot;, and Joseph in &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot;.

==Career==
===1978–1986: First Eurovision win===
Logan adopted the stage name Johnny Logan after the main character of the film &quot;Johnny Guitar&quot; and released his first single in 1978. He first attempted to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1979, when he placed third in the Irish National Final with the song &quot;Angie&quot;. Readers of &quot;The Connaught Telegraph&quot; in Ireland voted Logan as Best New Male Artist.

In 1980, Logan again entered the Irish National selection for the Eurovision Song Contest with the Shay Healy song &quot;What&#x27;s Another Year&quot;, winning the Irish final on 9 March in Dublin. Representing Ireland in the Netherlands, Logan won the Eurovision Song Contest on 19 April. The song became a hit all over Europe and reached number one in the UK.

&quot;In London&quot; was released in June and &quot;Save Me&quot; shortly after. With confusion by radio stations over which to play, both singles flopped. Another single released in late 1980, a cover of a recent Cliff Richard song, &quot;Give A Little Bit More&quot; was a more concerted effort and although it narrowly missed the chart. Logan blames his lack of success in the UK on poor management and his inexperience.

In early 1983, Logan attempted a comeback in the UK with the song &quot;Becoming Electric&quot; with a new sound and image and promotional push, but the song failed to chart. In 1985, Logan released his third studio album &quot;Straight From The Heart&quot; which failed to chart. 
He also collaborated on the chart topping charity single &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot; in aid of the Bradford City Disaster Fund. In 1986, Logan rebranded himself as &quot;Logan&quot; with the song &quot;Stab in the Back&quot;, which also failed to chart.

===1987–1991: Second Eurovision win===

In 1987, Logan made another attempt at Eurovision and with his self-penned song, &quot;Hold Me Now&quot;, he represented Ireland at the Eurovision Song Contest in Belgium. The song won the contest and Logan became the first person to win the contest twice. &quot;Hold Me Now&quot; became a major European hit and reached number two in the UK. Logan released a cover of the 10cc song &quot;I&#x27;m Not in Love&quot;, produced by Paul Hardcastle as a follow-up, and an album &quot;Hold Me Now&quot;. In 1988, Logan released &quot;Heartland&quot; which became a hit in the Irish charts and from then on, concentrated on his career in Ireland and Europe.

In 1990, Logan recorded a country version of &quot;Miss You Nights&quot; with Elvis Presley&#x27;s backing band The Jordanaires. He also wrote and sang the theme song Angels Don&#x27;t Hide for the German television show Blue Blood.

===1992–2000: Third Eurovision win===

Having composed the Irish Eurovision Song Contest 1984 entry for Linda Martin, &quot;Terminal 3&quot; (which finished in second place), Logan repeated the collaboration in 1992 when he gave Martin another of his songs, &quot;Why Me&quot;. The song became the Irish entry at the finals in Sweden. The song took the title and cemented Logan as the most successful artist in Eurovision history with three wins.

Author and historian John Kennedy O&#x27;Connor notes in his book &quot;The Eurovision Song Contest – The Official History&quot; that Logan is the only lead singer to have sung two winning entries and one of only five authors/composers (all men) to have written/composed two winning songs.

On 16 April 1997 Logan left his handprints in concrete on the Walk of Fame in Rotterdam; The largest Star Boulevard in Europe.

===2000–present: Recent career ===
Logan continues to perform and write songs. He is sometimes referred to as &quot;Mister Eurovision&quot; by fans of the contest and the media at large. He has continued his love of participating in musical theatre, having toured Norway with &quot;Which Witch&quot;, an opera-musical originating in that country.

In October 2005, &quot;Hold Me Now&quot; was voted as the third most popular song in Eurovision history at the 50th anniversary concert in Copenhagen, Denmark. &quot;What&#x27;s Another Year&quot; was also nominated amongst the 14 finalists. Logan has sold more than 3 million copies worldwide. &quot;Hold Me Now&quot; is also a global million-seller.

Logan has continued to have success, particularly in the Scandinavian countries. His 2007 album, &quot;The Irish Connection&quot; went platinum in Denmark, twice platinum in Norway and gold in Sweden.

In 2009 and 2010, he performed in the Celtic rock opera &quot;Excalibur&quot;, and continued to do so in 2011.

Logan was one of the recording artists that appeared in the Irish TV series &quot;The Hit&quot; going against Duke Special. He shortlisted the song &quot;Prayin&#x27;&quot; by Alan Earls and Jamie Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Rain&quot; from the pitching rooms. He chose to release &quot;Prayin&#x27;&quot; for the chart battle against Special who chose a song called &quot;1969&quot; by Aaron Hackett. Logan won the chart battle with his song charting at number three in the charts while Special&#x27;s charted at number five. Logan returned for the final where he performed &quot;Prayin&quot; with the RTÉ Concert Orchestra and was runner-up to Finbar Furey.

In 2024, he appeared in Malmö during the first semi-final of that year&#x27;s Eurovision Song Contest, covering &quot;Euphoria&quot; by Loreen.

==In popular culture==
In 2002, he took part in the UK television quiz show &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot; as a team panelist in a Eurovision-special.

&quot;Hold Me Now&quot; has been adopted by fans of Bohemian F.C. (Bohemians) as their anthem and it is played in Dalymount and sung with gusto at both home and away matches.

In 2007, Logan advertised McDonald&#x27;s Eurosaver menu in Ireland. In 2007, he sang &quot;A State of Happiness&quot;, advertising the Dutch Center Parcs.

In 2011, Logan received some publicity over comments perceived as an attack on Jedward, that year&#x27;s Irish Eurovision entry. When the identical twins appeared on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;, presenter Ryan Tubridy asked them how they felt about Logan calling them &quot;an embarrassment to Ireland&quot;. Logan later clarified those comments: &quot;What I said was that I find them embarrassing to watch. It&#x27;s like watching two Frank Spencers in &quot;Some Mothers Do &#x27;Ave &#x27;Em&quot;. It&#x27;s like watching a train crash – you can&#x27;t look away, but at the same time you don&#x27;t want to see it&quot;. He subsequently refused an interview with RTÉ broadcaster Derek Mooney as, according to Mooney, &quot;he thought we were going to stitch him up&quot;. Logan gave an interview to Today FM broadcaster Ray D&#x27;Arcy instead.

On 16 December 2012, Logan appeared as musical guest on Romanian edition of &quot;X Factor&quot;.

In May 2012, Anmary, the Latvian representative to 2012 Eurovision Song Contest held in Baku, Azerbaijan sang &quot;Beautiful Song&quot; where, in the opening lyrics, she sings: &quot;I was born in distant 1980 / The year that Irish Johnny Logan won / Thirty years or more, they still remember / So dream away, today&#x27;s the day I&#x27;m singing my song&quot; referring to Logan&#x27;s 1980 Eurovision win &quot;What&#x27;s Another Year&quot;.

In 2020, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; revealed a movie about the life and career of Logan was in the works - called &quot;Mr Eurovision&quot;.

Logan performed &quot;What&#x27;s Another Year&quot; during the &quot;&quot; programme, held on 16 May 2020 as a replacement for the cancelled Eurovision Song Contest 2020. He performed the song with the programme&#x27;s presenters Chantal Janzen, Edsilia Rombley and Jan Smit, alongside a choir of Eurovision fans. 

In June 2021 Logan released a new single &quot;Just one look&quot; with Finnish singer Jannike.
In 2022, he was a contestant in the second season of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; in Belgium, as &#x27;the red deer&#x27;.

==Personal life==
Logan lives part-time in Ireland and part-time in Germany with his girlfriend and manager Tanja Surmann. Logan has three sons Adam, Fionn and Jack from his marriage to Ailis Sherrard. He also has a daughter, Robyn (born in 1988) with Turkish dancer and actress Burçin Orhon. He rarely gives media interviews, claiming to have been frequently misquoted.

<doc id="231728" wikidata="Q132905" url="?curid=231728" title="Humpback whale">
<text>The humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) is a species of baleen whale. It is a rorqual (a member of the family Balaenopteridae) and is the only species in the genus Megaptera. Adults range in length from and weigh up to . The humpback has a distinctive body shape, with long pectoral fins and tubercles on its head. It is known for breaching and other distinctive surface behaviors, making it popular with whale watchers. Males produce a complex song that typically lasts from 4 to 33 minutes.

Found in oceans and seas around the world, humpback whales typically migrate up to each year. They feed in polar waters and migrate to tropical or subtropical waters to breed and give birth. Their diet consists mostly of krill and small fish, and they usually use bubbles to catch prey. They are polygynandrous breeders, with both sexes having multiple partners. Orcas are the main natural predators of humpback whales. The bodies of humpbacks host barnacles and whale lice.

Like other large whales, the humpback was a target for the whaling industry. Humans once hunted the species to the brink of extinction: its population fell to around 5,000 by the 1960s. Numbers have partially recovered to some 135,000 animals worldwide, but entanglement in fishing gear, collisions with ships, and noise pollution continue to affect the species.

== Taxonomy ==
The humpback was first identified as by Mathurin Jacques Brisson in his &quot;Regnum Animale&quot; of 1756. In 1781, Georg Heinrich Borowski described the species, converting Brisson&#x27;s name to its Latin equivalent, &quot;Balaena novaeangliae&quot;. In 1804, Bernard Germain de Lacépède renamed it &quot;B. jubartes&quot;. In 1846, John Edward Gray created the genus &quot;Megaptera&quot;, classifying the humpback as &quot;Megaptera longipinna&quot;, but in 1932, Remington Kellogg reverted the species name to use Borowski&#x27;s &quot;novaeangliae&quot;. The common name is derived from the curving of the whales&#x27; backs when diving. The genus name, &quot;Megaptera&quot;, from the Ancient Greek &quot;mega-&quot; (&quot;giant&quot;) and &quot;ptera&quot; (&quot;wing&quot;), refer to their large front flippers. The species name means &quot;New Englander&quot; and was probably given by Brisson due to regular sightings of humpbacks off the coast of New England.

Humpback whales are rorquals, members of the family Balaenopteridae, which includes the blue, fin, Bryde&#x27;s, sei, and minke whales. A 2018 genomic analysis estimated that rorquals diverged from other baleen whales in the late Miocene, between 10.5 and 7.5 million years ago. The humpback and fin whales were found to be sister taxons (see the phylogenetic tree below). There is reference to a humpback–blue whale hybrid in the South Pacific, attributed to marine biologist Michael Poole.

Modern humpback whale populations originated in the southern hemisphere around 880,000 years ago and colonized the northern hemisphere 200,000 to 50,000 years ago. A 2014 genetic study suggested that the separate populations in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and Southern Oceans have had limited gene flow and are distinct enough to be subspecies, with the scientific names of &quot;M. n. novaeangliae&quot;, &quot;M. n. kuzira&quot;, and &quot;M. n. australis&quot;, respectively. A non-migratory population in the Arabian Sea has been isolated for 70,000 years.

== Characteristics ==
The adult humpback whale is generally long, though individuals up to long have been recorded. Females are usually longer than males. The species can reach body masses of . Calves are born at around long with a mass of . The species has a bulky body with a thin rostrum and proportionally long flippers, each around one-third of its body length. It has a short dorsal fin that varies from nearly nonexistent to somewhat long and curved. Like other rorquals, the humpback has grooves between the tip of the lower jaw and the navel. The grooves are relatively few in number in this species, ranging from 14 to 35. The upper jaws is lined with baleen plates, which number 540–800 in total and are black in color.

The dorsal or upper side of the animal is generally black; the ventral or underside has various levels of black and white coloration. Whales in the southern hemisphere tend to have more white pigmentation. The flippers can vary from all-white to white only on the undersurface. Some individuals may be all white, notably Migaloo who is a true albino. The varying color patterns and scars on the tail flukes distinguish individual animals. The end of the genital slit of the female is marked by a round feature, known as the hemispherical lobe, which visually distinguishes males and females.

Unique among large whales, humpbacks have bumps or tubercles on the head and front edge of the flippers; the tail fluke has a jagged trailing edge. The tubercles on the head are thick at the base and protrude up to . They are mostly hollow in the center, often containing at least one fragile hair that erupts from the skin and is thick. The tubercles develop early in gestation and may have a sensory function, as they are rich in nerves. Sensory nerve cells in the skin are adapted to withstand the high water pressure of diving.

In one study, a humpback whale brain measured long and wide at the tips of the temporal lobes, and weighed around . The humpback&#x27;s brain has a complexity similar to that of the brains of smaller whales and dolphins. Computer models of the middle ear suggest that the humpback can hear at frequencies between 15Hz and 3kHz &quot;when stimulated at the tympanic membrane&quot;, and between 200Hz and 9kHz &quot;if stimulated at the thinner region of the tympanic bone adjacent to the tympanic membrane&quot;. These ranges are consistent with their vocalization ranges. As in all cetaceans, the respiratory tract of the humpback whale is connected to the blowholes and not to the mouth, although the species appears to be able to unlock the epiglottis and larynx and move them towards the oral cavity, allowing humpbacks to blow bubbles from their mouths. The vocal folds of the humpback are more horizontally positioned than those of land mammals which allows them to produce underwater calls. These calls are amplified by a laryngeal sac.

== Behavior and ecology ==
Humpback whale groups, aside from mothers and calves, typically stay together for days or weeks at the most. They are normally sighted in small groups, though large aggregations form during feeding and among males competing for females. Humpbacks may interact with other cetacean species, such as right whales, fin whales, and bottlenose dolphins. Humpbacks are highly active at the surface, performing aerial behaviors such as breaching, surface slapping with the tail fluke (lobtailing) and flippers, and peduncle throws, which involve the tail crashing sideways on the surface. These may be forms of play and communication, and may help to remove parasites. The species is a slower swimmer than other rorquals, cruising at . When threatened, a humpback may speed up to . Their proportionally long pectoral fins give them great propulsion and allow them to swim in any direction, independently of the movements of the tail. Humpbacks are able to flap and rotate their flippers in a manner similar to California sea lions.

Humpbacks rest at the surface with their bodies lying horizontally. They frequent shallow seamounts, commonly exploring depths of up to and occasionally diving as deep as . These deeper descents are believed to serve various purposes, including navigational guidance, communication with fellow humpback whales, and facilitation of feeding activities. Dives typically do not exceed five minutes during the summer but are normally 15–20 minutes during the winter. As it dives, a humpback typically raises its tail fluke, exposing the underside. Humpbacks have been observed to produce oral &quot;bubble clouds&quot; when near another individual, possibly in the context of &quot;aggression, mate attraction, or play&quot;. Humpbacks may also use bubble clouds as &quot;smoke screens&quot; to escape from predators.

Humpback whales feed from spring to fall. They are generalist feeders; their main food items are krill, copepods, other plankton, and small schooling fish. The most common krill species eaten in the southern hemisphere is the Antarctic krill. Farther north, the northern krill and various species of &quot;Euphausia&quot; and &quot;Thysanoessa&quot; are consumed. Fish prey include herring, capelin, sand lances, and Atlantic mackerel. Like other rorquals, humpbacks are &quot;gulp feeders&quot;, swallowing prey in bulk, while right whales and bowhead whales are skimmers. The whale increases its mouth gape by expanding the grooves. Water is pushed out through the baleen. 

In the southern hemisphere, humpbacks have been recorded foraging in large, compact gatherings numbering up to 200 individuals. A study undertaken in May 2009 found a super-aggregation of krill in Wilhelmina Bay, on the west side of the Antarctic Peninsula, with a large number of humpback whales feeding on the krill. Researchers counted a density of 5.1 whales per square kilometer. Smaller and less dense aggregations of krill and whales were also found in Andvord Bay to the south. Krill and humpback whales are abundant in late autumn along the western Antarctic Peninsula, particularly in Wilhelmina Bay, where the whales seem to eat as much as possible in preparation for the winter.

Humpbacks typically hunt their prey with bubble nets, which is considered to be a form of tool use. Bubble-net feeding allows whales to consume more food per mouthful while using less energy; it is particularly useful for low-density prey patches. A group swims in a shrinking circle while blowing air from their blowholes, capturing prey above in a cylinder of bubbles. They may dive up to while performing this technique. Bubble-netting comes in two main forms: upward spirals and double loops. Upward spirals involve the whales blowing air from their blowholes continuously as they circle towards the surface, creating a spiral of bubbles. Double loops consist of a deep, long loop of bubbles that herds the prey, followed by slapping the surface and then a smaller loop of bubbles that precedes the final capture. Combinations of spiraling and looping have been recorded. After the humpbacks create the &quot;nets&quot;, the whales swim into them with their mouths gaping and ready to swallow. Bubble-net feeding has also been observed in solitary humpbacks. 

Using network-based diffusion analysis, one study argued that whales learned lobtailing from other whales in their group over 27 years in response to a change in primary prey. The tubercles on the flippers stall the angle of attack, which both maximizes lift and minimizes drag (see tubercle effect). This, along with the shape of the flippers, allows the whales to make the abrupt turns necessary during bubble-feeding.

At Stellwagen Bank off the coast of Massachusetts, humpback whales have been recorded foraging at the seafloor for sand lances. This involves the whales flushing out the fish by brushing their jaws against the bottom.

=== Courtship and reproduction ===

Mating takes place during the winter months, which is when females reach estrus and males reach peak testosterone and sperm levels. Humpback whales are polygynandrous (both sexes have multiple partners). Males frequently trail both lone females and cow–calf pairs. These males are known as &quot;escorts&quot;; the male that is closest to the female is known as the &quot;principal escort&quot;, and fights off the other suitors, known as &quot;challengers&quot;. Other males, called &quot;secondary escorts&quot;, trail farther behind and are not directly involved in the conflict. Agonistic behavior between males consists of tail slashing, ramming, and head-butting. Males have also been observed engaging in copulation with each other.

Gestation in the species lasts 11.5 months, and females reproduce every two years. Fetuses start out with teeth and develop their baleen during the last months of their gestation. Humpback whale births have rarely been observed by humans. One birth witnessed off Madagascar occurred within four minutes. Mothers typically give birth in mid-winter, usually to a single calf. Before birth, a mother whale will move to shallower water near the coast, which reduces her chances of being harassed by escort males. It is common for the mother to help her newborn calf reach the surface. Young start out with furled dorsal fins, which straighten and stiffen as the calves get older. Calves with furled fins spend more time traveling and surfacing to breathe; calves with straighter fins can hold their breath longer and can rest and circle at the surface more. Older calves are away from their mothers more than younger calves. Calves suckle for up to a year but can eat adult food at six months. Humpbacks are sexually mature at 5–10 years, depending on the population. They may live for over 50 years.

=== Vocalizations ===

Male humpback whales produce complex songs during the winter breeding season. These vocals range in frequency between 100 Hz and 4 kHz, with harmonics reaching up to 24 kHz or more, and can travel at least . Males may sing for between 4 and 33 minutes, depending on the region. In Hawaii, humpback whales have been recorded vocalizing for as long as seven hours. Songs are divided into &quot;subunits&quot;, &quot;units&quot;, &quot;subphrases&quot;, &quot;phrases&quot;, and &quot;themes&quot;. A subunit refers to the discontinuities or inflections of a sound, while full units are individual sounds, similar to musical notes. A succession of units creates a subphrase, and a collection of subphrases make up a phrase. Similar-sounding phrases are repeated in a series grouped into themes, and multiple themes create a song. Humpback whale songs appear to follow Zipf&#x27;s law, similar to human languages.

The function of these songs has been debated, and they may have multiple purposes. There is little evidence to suggest that songs establish dominance among males. However, there have been observations of non-singing males disrupting singers, possibly in aggression. Those who join singers are males who were not previously singing. Females do not appear to approach singers that are alone, but may be drawn to gatherings of singing males, much like a lek mating system. Another possibility is that songs bring in foreign whales to populate breeding grounds. It has also been suggested that humpback whale songs have echolocating properties and may serve to locate other whales. A 2023 study found that as humpback whale numbers have recovered from whaling, singing has become less common.

Whale songs are similar among males in a specific area. Males may alter their songs over time, and others in contact with them copy these changes. Songs have been shown in some cases to spread between neighboring populations throughout successive breeding seasons. In the northern hemisphere, songs change more gradually, while southern hemisphere songs go through cyclical &quot;revolutions&quot;.

Humpback whales are reported to make other vocalizations. &quot;Snorts&quot; are quick, low-frequency sounds, commonly heard among animals in groups consisting of a mother–calf pair and one or more male escorts. These likely function to mediate interactions within these groups. &quot;Grumbles&quot; are also low in frequency but last longer and are more often made by groups containing one or more adult males. They appear to signal body size and may serve to establish social status. &quot;Thwops&quot; and &quot;wops&quot; are frequency-modulated vocals that may serve as contact calls both within and between groups. High-pitched &quot;cries&quot;, &quot;violins&quot;, and modulated &quot;shrieks&quot; are normally heard in groups with two or more males and are associated with competition. Humpback whales produce short, low-frequency &quot;grunts&quot; and short, modulated &quot;barks&quot; when joining new groups.

===Predation===
Visible scars indicate that orcas prey upon juvenile humpbacks. A 2014 study in Western Australia observed that when available in large numbers, young humpbacks can be attacked and sometimes killed by orcas. Mothers and (possibly related) adults escort calves to deter such predation. The suggestion is that when humpbacks suffered near-extinction during the whaling era, orcas turned to other prey but are now resuming their former practice. There is also evidence that humpback whales will defend against or mob orcas who are attacking either humpback calves or juveniles as well as members of other species, including seals. The humpback&#x27;s protection of other species may be unintentional, a &quot;spillover&quot; of mobbing behavior intended to protect members of its species. The powerful flippers of humpback whales, often infested with large, sharp barnacles, are formidable weapons against orcas. When threatened, they will thrash their flippers and tails, keeping the orcas at bay.

The great white shark is another confirmed predator of the humpback whale. In 2020, Marine biologists Dines and Gennari et al. published a documented incident of a pair of great white sharks attacking and killing a live adult humpback whale. A second incident of a great white shark killing a humpback whale was documented off the coast of South Africa. Working alone, the shark attacked a , emaciated and entangled humpback whale by attacking the whale&#x27;s tail to cripple and bleed the whale before she managed to drown the whale by biting onto its head and pulling it underwater.

===Infestations and health threats===

Humpback whales often have barnacles living on their skin, the most common being the acorn barnacle species &quot;Coronula diadema&quot; and &quot;Coronula reginae&quot;, which in turn are sites for attachment for goose barnacle species like &quot;Conchoderma auritum&quot; and &quot;Conchoderma virgatum&quot;. They are most abundant at the lower jaw tip, along the middle ventral groove, near the genital slit, and between the bumps on the flippers. &quot;C. reginae&quot; digs deep into the skin, while attachments by &quot;C. diadema&quot; are more superficial. The size of the latter species provides more sites for attachment by other barnacles. Barnacles are considered to be epibionts rather than parasites, as they do not feed on the whales, though they can affect their swimming by increasing drag. 

The whale louse species &quot;Cyamus boopis&quot; is specialized for feeding on humpback whales and is the only species in its family found on them. Internal parasites of humpbacks include protozoans of the genus &quot;Entamoeba&quot;, tapeworms of the family Diphyllobothriidae, and roundworms of the infraorder Ascaridomorpha.

Saxitoxin, a paralytic shellfish poisoning from contaminated mackerel, has been implicated in humpback whale deaths. 

==Range==

Humpback whales are found in marine waters worldwide, except for some areas at the equator and High Arctic and some enclosed seas. The farthest north they have been recorded is at 81°N around northern Franz Josef Land. They are usually coastal and tend to congregate in waters within continental shelves. Their winter breeding grounds are located around the equator; their summer feeding areas are found in colder waters, including near the polar ice caps. Humpbacks go on vast migrations between their feeding and breeding areas, often crossing the open ocean. The species has been recorded traveling up to in one direction. 

===Northern Hemisphere===

In the North Atlantic, there are two separate wintering populations, one in the West Indies, from Cuba to northern Venezuela, and the other in the Cape Verde Islands and northwest Africa. During summer, West Indies humpbacks congregate off New England, eastern Canada, and western Greenland, while the Cape Verde population gathers around Iceland and Norway. There is some overlap in the summer ranges of these populations, and West Indies humpbacks have been documented feeding farther east. Whale visits into the Gulf of Mexico have been infrequent but have occurred in the gulf historically. They were considered to be uncommon in the Mediterranean Sea, but increased sightings, including re-sightings, indicate that more whales may colonize or recolonize it in the future.

The North Pacific has at least four breeding populations: off Mexico (including Baja California and the Revillagigedos Islands), Central America, the Hawaiian Islands, and both Okinawa and the Philippines. The Mexican population forages from the Aleutian Islands to California. During the summer, Central American humpbacks are found only off Oregon and California. In contrast, Hawaiian humpbacks have a wide feeding range, but most travel to southeast Alaska and northern British Columbia. The wintering grounds of the Okinawa/Philippines population are mainly around the Russian Far East. There is some evidence for a fifth population somewhere in the northwestern Pacific. These whales are recorded to feed off the Aleutians, with a breeding area somewhere south of the Bonin Islands.

An isolated, non-migratory population feeds and breeds in the northern Indian Ocean, mainly in the Arabian Sea around Oman. This population has also been recorded in the Gulf of Aden, the Persian Gulf, and off the coasts of Pakistan and India.

===Southern Hemisphere===

In the Southern Hemisphere, humpback whales are divided into seven breeding stocks, some of which are further divided into sub-structures. These include the southwestern Atlantic (stock A), the southeastern Atlantic (stock B), the southwestern Indian Ocean (stock C), the southeastern Indian Ocean (stock D), the southwestern Pacific and Oceania (stocks E and F), and the southeastern Pacific (stock G). Stock G breeds in tropical and subtropical waters off the west coast of Central and South America and forages along the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula, the South Orkney Islands, and to a lesser extent Tierra del Fuego. Stock A winters off Brazil and migrates to summer grounds around South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. Some stock A individuals have also been recorded off the western Antarctic Peninsula, suggesting an increased blurring of the boundaries between the feeding areas of stocks A and G.

Stock B breeds on the west coast of Africa and is further divided into Bl and B2 subpopulations, the former ranging from the Gulf of Guinea to Angola and the latter ranging from Angola to western South Africa. Stock B whales have been recorded foraging in waters to the southwest of the continent, mainly around Bouvet Island. Comparison of songs between those at Cape Lopez and the Abrolhos Archipelago indicate that trans-Atlantic mixings between stock A and stock B whales occur. Stock C whales winter around southeastern Africa and surrounding waters. This stock is further divided into C1, C2, C3, and C4 subpopulations; C1 occurs around Mozambique and eastern South Africa, C2 around the Comoro Islands, C3 off the southern and eastern coast of Madagascar, and C4 around the Mascarene Islands. The feeding range of this population is likely between coordinates 5°W and 60°E and south of 50°S. There may be overlap in the feeding areas of stocks B and C.

Stock D whales breed off the western coast of Australia and forage in the southern region of the Kerguelen Plateau. Stock E is divided into E1, E2, and E3 subpopulations. E1 whales have a breeding range off eastern Australia and Tasmania; their main feeding range is close to Antarctica, mainly between 130°E and 170°W. The Oceania stock is divided into the New Caledonia (E2), Tonga (E3), Cook Islands (F1), and French Polynesia (F2) subpopulations. This stock&#x27;s feeding grounds mainly range from around the Ross Sea to the Antarctic Peninsula.

== Human relations ==
=== Whaling ===

Humpback whales were hunted as early as the late 16th century. They were often the first whale species to be harvested in an area due to their coastal distribution. North Pacific kills alone are estimated at 28,000 during the 20th century. In the same period, over 200,000 humpbacks were taken in the Southern Hemisphere. North Atlantic populations dropped to as low as 700 individuals. In 1946, the International Whaling Commission (IWC) was founded to oversee the industry. They imposed hunting regulations and created hunting seasons. To prevent extinction, the IWC banned commercial humpback whaling in 1966. By then, the global population had been reduced to around 5,000. The Soviet Union deliberately under-recorded its catches: the Soviets reported catching 2,820 between 1947 and 1972, but the true number was over 48,000.

As of 2004, hunting was restricted to a few animals each year off the Caribbean island of Bequia in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. The take is not believed to threaten the local population. Japan had planned to kill 50 humpbacks in the 2007–08 season under its JARPA II research program. The announcement sparked global protests. After a visit to Tokyo by the IWC chair asking the Japanese for their co-operation in sorting out the differences between pro- and anti-whaling nations on the commission, the Japanese whaling fleet agreed to take no humpback whales during the two years it would take to reach a formal agreement. In 2010, the IWC authorized Greenland&#x27;s native population to hunt a few humpback whales during the following three years.

=== Whale-watching ===

Much of the growth of commercial whale watching was focused on the humpback whale. The species&#x27; highly active surface behaviors and tendency to become accustomed to boats have made them easy to observe, particularly for photographers. In 1975, humpback whale tours were established in New England and Hawaii. This business brings in a revenue of $20 million per year for Hawaii&#x27;s economy. While Hawaiian tours have tended to be commercial, New England and California whale watching tours have introduced educational components. 

Although whale watching can raise awareness of humpback whale conservation, whale watching boats can have negative impacts on humpbacks whales, including causing stress and disturbing behaviors like feeding, mating and socializing. This is particularly deleterious for mothers with calves. Regulations on whale vessels have included restrictions on how close the vessels can get to the whales.

== Conservation status ==

As of 2018, the IUCN Red List lists the humpback whale as of least concern, with a worldwide population of around 135,000 whales, of which around 84,000 are mature individuals, and an increasing population trend. Regional estimates are around 13,000 in the North Atlantic, 21,000 in the North Pacific, and 80,000 in the southern hemisphere. For the isolated population in the Arabian Sea, only around 80 individuals remain, and this population is considered to be endangered. In most areas, humpback whale populations have recovered from historic whaling, particularly in the North Pacific. Such recoveries have led to the downlisting of the species&#x27; threatened status in the United States, Canada, and Australia. In Costa Rica, Ballena Marine National Park was established for humpback protection.

Humpbacks still face man-made threats, including entanglement by fishing gear, vessel collisions, human-caused noise and traffic disturbance, coastal habitat destruction, and climate change. Like other cetaceans, humpbacks can be injured by excessive noise. In the 19th century, two humpback whales were found dead near repeated oceanic sub-bottom blasting sites, with traumatic injuries and fractures in their ears. While oil ingestion is a risk for whales, a 2019 study found that oil did not foul baleen and instead was easily rinsed by flowing water.

NOAA recorded 88 stranded humpback whales between January 2016 and February 2019 along the Atlantic coast of the US. This is more than double the number of whales stranded between 2013 and 2016. Because of the increase in stranded whales, NOAA declared an unusual mortality event in April 2017. Virginia Beach Aquarium&#x27;s stranding response coordinator, Alexander Costidis, concluded that the two causes of these unusual mortality events were vessel interactions and entanglements. 

Around the Strait of Magellan, humpbacks have been the whale species that is most commonly reported to be involved in ship–whale collisions since at least 2013. To decrease the number of collisions, speed limits have been proposed in the area around the Francisco Coloane Marine and Coastal Protected Area.

<text>NIMBY (, or nimby), an acronym for the phrase &quot;not in my back yard&quot;, is a characterization of opposition by residents to proposed real estate development and infrastructure developments in their local area, as well as support for strict land use regulations. It carries the connotation that such residents are only opposing the development because it is close to them and that they would tolerate or support it if it were built farther away. The residents are often called nimbys, and their viewpoint is called nimbyism. The opposite movement is known as YIMBY for &quot;yes in my back yard&quot;.

Some examples of projects that have been opposed by nimbys include housing development (especially for affordable housing or trailer parks), high-speed rail lines, homeless shelters, day cares, schools, universities and colleges, bike lanes and transportation planning that promotes pedestrian safety infrastructure, solar farms, wind farms, incinerators, sewage treatment systems, fracking, and nuclear waste repositories.

==Rationale==
Developments likely to attract local objections include:

* Infrastructure development, such as new roads and rest areas, railway, light rail and metro lines, airports, power plants, retail developments, sales of public assets, electrical transmission lines, wastewater treatment plants, landfills, sewage outfalls and prisons;
* Waste facility development, e.g. exploration of disposal sites for nuclear/radiation waste;
* The extraction of mineral resources including ore, aggregates and hydrocarbons from mines, quarries and oil wells or gas wells, respectively;
* Renewable energy generators, such as wind farms and solar panels;
* Businesses trading in goods perceived as immoral, such as adult video, liquor stores, and cannabis dispensaries;
* Accommodations perceived as primarily benefiting disadvantaged people, such as subsidized housing for the financially disadvantaged, supportive housing for the mentally ill, congregate living care homes (as for the developmentally disabled), halfway houses for drug addicts and criminals, and homeless shelters.
* Services catering to certain stigmatized groups (for example, injection drug users), such as methadone clinics, syringe exchange programmes, drug detoxification facilities, supervised injection site;
* Large-scale developments of all kinds, such as big-box stores and housing subdivisions.

The claimed reasons against these developments vary, and some are given below.

* Increased traffic: more jobs, more housing or more stores correlates to increased traffic on local streets and greater demand for parking spots. Industrial facilities such as warehouses, factories, or landfills often increase the volume of truck traffic.
* Harm to locally owned small businesses: the development of a big box store may provide too much competition to a locally owned store; similarly, the construction of a new road may make the older road less traveled, leading to a loss of business for property owners. This can lead to excessive relocation costs, or to loss of respected local businesses.
* Loss of residential property value: homes near an undesirable development may be less desirable for potential buyers. The lost revenue from property taxes may, or may not, be offset by increased revenue from the project.
* Environmental pollution of land, air, and water: power plants, factories, chemical facilities, crematoriums, sewage treatment facilities, airports, and similar projects may—or may be claimed to—contaminate the land, air, or water around them. Especially facilities assumed to smell might cause objections.
* Light pollution: projects that operate at night, or that include security lighting (such as street lights in a parking lot), may be accused of causing light pollution.
* Noise pollution: in addition to the noise of traffic, a project may inherently be noisy. This is a common objection to wind power, airports, roads, and many industrial facilities, but also stadiums, festivals, and nightclubs which are particularly noisy at night when locals want to sleep.
* Visual blight and failure to &quot;blend in&quot; with the surrounding architecture: the proposed project might be ugly or particularly large, or cast a shadow over an area due to its height.
* Loss of a community&#x27;s small-town feel: proposals that might result in new people moving into the community, such as a plan to build many new houses, are often claimed to change the community&#x27;s character.
* Strain of public resources and schools: this reason is given for any increase in the local area&#x27;s population, as additional school facilities might be needed for the additional children, but particularly to projects that might result in certain kinds of people joining the community, such as a group home for people with disabilities, or immigrants.
* Disproportionate benefit to non-locals: the project appears to benefit distant people, such as investors (in the case of commercial projects like factories or big-box stores) or people from neighboring areas (in the case of regional government projects, such as airports, highways, sewage treatment, or landfills).
* Increases in crime: this is usually applied to projects that are perceived as attracting or employing low-skill workers or racial minorities, as well as projects that cater to people who are thought to often commit crimes, such as the mentally ill, the poor, and drug addicts. Additionally, certain types of projects, such as pubs or medical marijuana dispensaries, might be perceived as directly increasing the amount of crime in the area.
* Risk of an (environmental) disaster, such as with drilling operations, chemical industry, dams, or nuclear power plants.
* Historic districts: the affected area is on a heritage register, because of its many older properties that are being preserved as such.

The cause of NIMBYism is seen by some due to spatially concentrated costs and diffuse benefits together with regulatory transaction costs which result in a failure of conflict resolution.

As hinted by the list, protests can occur for opposite reasons. A new road or shopping center can cause increased traffic and work opportunities for some, and decreased traffic for others, harming local businesses.

People in an area affected by plans sometimes form an organization which can collect money and organize the objection activities. NIMBYists can hire a lawyer to file formal appeals, and contact media to gain public support for their case.

==Origin and history==
The acronym first appeared in a February 1979 newspaper article in Virginia&#x27;s &quot;Daily Press&quot;. 
The article may have been quoting Joseph A. Lieberman, a member of the United States Atomic Energy Commission. The phrase &#x27;&quot;not in my back yard&quot; syndrome,&#x27; without the acronym, also appeared in an environmental journal in February 1980. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;&#x27;s earliest citation is a &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; article from November 1980, although even there the author indicates the term is already used in the hazardous waste industry.
The concept behind the term, that of locally organized resistance to unwanted land uses, is likely to have originated earlier. One suggestion is it emerged in the 1950s.

In the 1980s, the term was popularized by British politician Nicholas Ridley, who was the Conservative Secretary of State for the Environment. Comedian George Carlin used the term in 1992 for his &quot;Jammin&#x27; in New York&quot; special, implying that people had already heard of it.

The NIMBY acronym has also been used by social scientists since the early 1980s to describe the resistance of communities to the siting of controversial facilities and land use.

The term&#x27;s connotation has harshened since its introduction in the 1980s. Beyond their impact on any single development or neighborhood, NIMBY organizations and policies are now painted as worsening racial segregation, deepening economic inequality, and limiting the overall supply of affordable housing. There have been a variety of books and articles on how to address NIMBY perspectives. One such article discussing NIMBY opposition to affordable housing by the National Low Income Housing Coalition.

==Variations==
&quot;NIMBY&quot; and its derivative terms &quot;nimbyism&quot;, &quot;nimbys&quot;, and &quot;nimbyists&quot;, refer implicitly to debates of development generally or to a specific case. As such, their use is inherently contentious. The term is usually applied to opponents of a development, implying that they have narrow, selfish, or myopic views. Its use is often pejorative.

===Not in my neighborhood===

The term &quot;Not in my neighborhood&quot;, or &quot;NIMN&quot;, is also frequently used. &quot;NIMN&quot; additionally refers to legislative actions or private agreements made with the sole purpose of maintaining racial identity within a particular neighborhood or residential area by forcefully keeping members of other races from moving into the area. In that regard, &quot;Not in My Neighborhood,&quot; by author and journalist Antero Pietila, describes the toll NIMN politics had on housing conditions in Baltimore throughout the 20th century and the systemic, racially based citywide separation it caused.

===BANANA and CAVE ===

&quot;BANANA&quot; is an acronym for &quot;build absolutely nothing anywhere near anything&quot; (or &quot;anyone&quot;). The term is most often used to criticize the ongoing opposition of certain advocacy groups to land development. The term is commonly used within the context of planning in the United Kingdom. Sunderland City Council lists the term in their online dictionary of jargon.

In the United States, the related phenomenon CAVE people or &quot;CAVE dwellers&quot; serves as an acronym for &quot;citizens against virtually everything.&quot; It is a pejorative term for citizens who regularly oppose any changes in their community, organization or workplace. A reference to the term &quot;CAVE dwellers&quot; can be found in the September 30, 1990, edition of the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot;. The term apparently existed before the publication of the article.

CAVE/BANANA people are characterized by implacable opposition to change in any form, regardless of what other local residents and stakeholders feel. This attitude is manifested in opposition to changes in public policy as varied as tax levies, sewer rates, public transportation routes, parking regulations and municipal mergers or annexations. CAVE/BANANA people often express their views publicly by attending community meetings, writing letters to the local newspaper, or calling in to talk radio shows, similar to NIMBYs.

The terms &quot;CAVE people&quot; and &quot;BANANAs&quot; were used in a 2022 op-ed to describe the populace of Stamford, Connecticut. The op-ed was written by a former municipal employee and described CAVE people as seeing &quot;no issue simultaneously arguing conflicting points so long as nothing changes.&quot;

Similar is &quot;NIABY&quot; or &quot;not in anyone&#x27;s backyard&quot;.

===PIBBY===

&quot;PIBBY&quot; is an acronym for &quot;place in blacks&#x27; back yard.&quot; This principle indicates that the people with perceived social, racial, and economic privileges object to a development in their own back yards, and if the objectionable item must be built, then it should be built so that its perceived harms disproportionately affect poor, socially disadvantaged people. Economically disadvantaged people might not be willing or able to hire a lawyer to appeal the right way, or might have more immediate troubles than a new nearby construction project. The environmental justice movement has pointed out nimbyism leads to environmental racism. Robert D. Bullard, Director of the Environmental Justice Resource Center at Clark Atlanta University, has argued that official responses to NIMBY phenomena have led to the PIBBY principle.

===Reverse NIMBY===
Reverse NIMBY is a phenomenon opposite to the widely known concept of NIMBY. Instead of arguing that it is troublesome that a hazardous facility is located in my backyard, proponents and people who exploit the concept of reverse NIMBY would say that &quot;If it happens in my backyard, it matters more because, well, it&#x27;s my backyard.&quot; It appears within the U.S. Congress where politicians actively use the mentality after major catastrophic events to garner recovery funds from the federal government. This is a viable strategy for members of Congress to garner benefits for their constituents because it is difficult for the federal government to understand needs at the local level.

==Points of debate==
Although often used rather pejoratively, the use of the concept NIMBY and similar terms have been critiqued by those who have been called NIMBYs. For instance, the term is frequently used to dismiss groups as selfish or ill-informed, even though these same groups claim to have virtues that are overlooked.

===In favor of development===

YIMBY, an acronym for &quot;yes, in my back yard&quot;, is a pro-development movement in contrast and opposition to the NIMBY phenomenon.

Frequently argued debate points in favor of development include higher employment, tax revenue, marginal cost of remote development, safety, and environmental benefits. Proponents of development may accuse locals of egotism, elitism, parochialism, drawbridge mentality, racism and anti-diversity, the inevitability of criticism, and misguided or unrealistic claims of prevention of urban sprawl. If people who do not want to be disturbed see the general need of an establishment, such as an airport, they generally suggest another location. But seen from society&#x27;s perspective, the other location might not be better, since people living there get disturbed instead. Strict land use regulations are an important driver of racial housing segregation in the United States. White communities are more likely to have strict land use regulations (and white people are more likely to support those regulations).

===In favor of local sovereignty===
Those labeled as NIMBYs may have a variety of motivations and may be unified only because they oppose a particular project. For example, some may oppose any significant change or development, regardless of type, purpose, or origin. Others, if the project is seen as being imposed by outsiders, may hold strong principles of self-governance, local sovereignty, local autonomy, and home rule. These people believe that local people should have the final choice, and that any project affecting the local people should clearly benefit themselves, rather than corporations with distant investors or central governments. Still others may object to a particular project because of its nature, e.g., opposing a nuclear power plant over fear of radiation, or opposing a local apartment complex due to worries about overcrowding or crime, but accepting a local waste management facility as a municipal necessity.

==Effects==
===Housing price===
Studies show that stricter land use regulation, such as the kind that arises from NIMBY advocacy, raises the price of housing, and consequently increases cost of living. Housing prices are affected by demand and supply of housing. The effect of moving chains is shown for change of housing prices.

===Social effects===
Homelessness is connected to lower housing supply and higher rents. Strict land use regulations contribute to racial housing segregation in the United States.

===Economy===
A study by economists Chang-Tai Hsieh and Enrico Moretti estimated that the housing restrictions brought on by NIMBY activists are costing US workers $1 trillion in reduced wages (several thousand dollars per worker) by making it unaffordable to relocate to higher-productivity cities.

===Opposition by type of use===
A 1994 paper by Michael Gerrard found that NIMBY movements generally oppose three types of facilities: waste disposal, low-income housing, and social services (such as homeless shelters). While opposition to waste disposal may have community benefits by encouraging recycling, it has also perpetuated the existence of those facilities in minority communities, while opposition to low-income housing and social services facilities has significant negative effects for society at large.

==Examples==
===Australia===
An Australian politician, Zali Steggall, representing Sydney Manly Beach, advocates action on climate change, including the installation of wind turbines. Suspecting the political proposal is to install wind turbines, Not In My Backyard, a tongue-in-cheek, online petition was set up to assess support for the establishment of wind farms on the Manly Beach.

===Canada===
====British Columbia====
In Vancouver, the city hall&#x27;s licensing department rejected a day care&#x27;s expansion from 8 to 16 kids after a small number of neighbors attended public meetings in 2023 to discuss the parking issues, noise, and traffic the additional children would bring to the neighborhood. According to city projections, Vancouver has a shortfall of 14,911 licensed child-care spaces.

====Nova Scotia====

In July 2012, residents of Kings County rallied against a bylaw, developed over three years of consultation and hearings, allowing wind generators to be constructed nearby. A similar theme arose in September 2009, where residents there rallied against a wind generator in Digby Neck. In January 2011, residents of Lawrencetown in Halifax County openly opposed a cellular telephone tower being built. A proposed development of downtown Dartmouth in August 2012 was also contested by residents. In February 2013, some residents of Lunenburg County opposed wind farms being built in the area, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s health and it&#x27;s property devaluation&quot; and &quot;This is an industrial facility put in the middle of rural Nova Scotia. It does not belong there.&quot;

In March 2013, some residents of the community of Blockhouse opposed the building and development of a recycling plant, referred to by one business owner as a &quot;dump.&quot; The plant would offer 75 jobs to the community of roughly 5,900 people. In the same month, the municipal councilors of Chester approved the building of wind turbines in the area in a 6–1 vote, despite some local opposition.

===China===
There have been successful NIMBY movements in China over the last few decades. In May 2014, in the city of Yuhang in Zhejiang Province, a NIMBY movement prevented the construction of a giant refuse incinerator. The victory came at enormous costs with many grassroot leaders arrested and many government infrastructures destroyed. However, in the case of China, many socially harmful projects simply continue their operation or relocate once media attention subsides and government authorities start to .

The Chinese government has also been accused of &quot;weaponizing&quot; NIMBY movements abroad through influence operations that drive opposition against perceived economic threats such as the development projects that compete with the rare earth industry in China.

===Ireland===
In 2020, there was significant opposition to the development of 650 apartments in the grounds of St Paul&#x27;s College school in the Dublin suburb of Raheny. 650 individual objections were received against the planning submission as well as several protests held.

Court challenges were taken by residents groups against the permission which was granted on the basis of not adequately addressing the EU habitats directive. Following a revised submission with a report on the effects to light-bellied Brent geese and other protected birds, the development was finally granted permission in August 2020.

===Italy===

The No TAV opposition to the Turin–Lyon high-speed railway is often characterized as a NIMBY movement.

===Japan===
====Narita Airport====
Starting in 1966, the Sanrizuka Struggle movement opposed the construction of Narita International Airport. Originally the plan for the airport also included a high speed railway line that was later scrapped. NIMBYs also prevented extension of the airport&#x27;s short second runway (unusable for anything but short-haul narrow-body aircraft) until the late 2000s, when cross-town Haneda Airport was opened to international traffic, as additional runways on landfill were completed at an extra cost of billions of dollars; the second runway was extended to .

====Odakyu Double Tracking====
Odakyu Electric Railway, now providing transit along a corridor with 5 million people living in walking distance of its rail and feeder bus service area, was originally built in the pre-war era, and as the city of Tokyo&#x27;s population ballooned, rail demand in suburbs exploded. By the 1960s, &quot;oshiya&quot; pushers were required to squash people into packed trains, and Odakyu Railway sought to expand its two-track lines to four, thus allowing more passing trains and faster run times as well as less crowding and congestive wait and hold of trains. NIMBY residents living near the line in the Setagaya ward fought attempts by the railway to acquire land; Odakyu attempted to buy each piece of land individually, offering high prices. The Setagaya Residents&#x27; opposition established a long-term and remarkable NIMBY case in the courts and legislature. By 1993, after three decades of trying, it was apparent this plan was failing, and the company decided to go for a multi-billion dollar solution: tunneling two lines underground, and then adding back two new lines stacked on top, to make four tracks in each direction for 12 stations and 10.4 km, instead of acquiring the land. The company&#x27;s decision began in 1993 and completed in 2004 for one critical section, meanwhile, for the second smaller section, this same decision was made in 2003 with project completion finally approaching fruition in March 2018, nearly six decades later.

===Serbia===

There is mounting opposition to the exploitation of lithium at the Jadar mine site by Rio Tinto in Western Serbia. The local residents are concerned about the impact of lithium mining on the local environment including water pollution with no regard to the economic and other environmental benefits including battery production reducing reliance on oil, less air pollution and lower emissions.. Opposition to lithium mining has been expressed by the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts and most Serbian opposition parties and organisations
. In September 2021, a series of environmental protests began in Belgrade and other locations in Serbia. Protesters demanded the rejection of Rio Tinto&#x27;s mine investment and the withdrawal of proposed changes to the Expropriation and Referendum Laws.

===United Kingdom===
====Oxford Memorial====

The Oxford Spanish Civil War memorial, built in 2017, is dedicated to locals who served the International Brigades against Spanish nationalist forces backed by Hitler and Mussolini. The memorial sits outside the city centre because all planning proposals to erect the memorial in the centre were rejected for numerous reasons, with Liberal Democrat councillors opposing all the suggested locations. The creation of the monument was also opposed by the Oxford Preservation Trust and the London Place Residents&#x27; Association. The current placement of the memorial was the third proposed location, with the previous two having their planning applications rejected by Oxford City Council. The first proposed spot was Bonn Square which was rejected citing that granite was not a stone native to Oxford. The second proposed location was St Giles&#x27; which was also rejected by councillors, claiming that the close proximity of an anti-fascist memorial to current war memorials would insult the memory of people who died during the Second World War. Some objected to the memorial because it did not honour &quot;both sides ... in a spirit of reconciliation and forgiveness&quot;, and called the design &quot;aggressive towards the memory of the victims of conflict&quot;.

Liberal Democrat councillor Elizabeth Wade opposed each proposed location for a monument in Oxford, although she claimed she was never opposed in principle. She described the second proposal on St Giles&#x27; near Oxford&#x27;s First and Second World War memorials as “aggressive and triumphalist”. Describing herself as a historian and speaking to the &quot;Oxford Mail&quot;, she then opposed the third and current location because she believed a monument with a red flag would glorify communism, despite no red flag ever being proposed to appear on the monument. Her rejection of every proposal led to Britain&#x27;s largest and longest running left-wing newspaper, the &quot;Morning Star&quot;, labelling her as a NIMBY.

====Ashtead, Surrey====
In 2007, residents of the affluent English village of Ashtead, Surrey, which lies on the outskirts of London, objected to the conversion of a large, £1.7 million residential property into a family support centre for relatives of wounded British service personnel. The house was to be purchased by a registered charity, SSAFA Forces Help. Local residents objected to the proposal out of fear of increased traffic and noise, as well as the possibility of an increased threat of terrorism. They also contended that the SSAFA charity is actually a business, thereby setting an unwelcome precedent. British newspapers ran articles titled &quot;No heroes in my backyard&quot;.

Ex-servicemen and several members of the British general public organised a petition in support of SSAFA, and even auctioned the &quot;Self Respect of Ashtead&quot; on eBay.

====High Speed 2====
Particularly in the time period preceding the final decision on the route of the high-speed railway known as High Speed 2, BBC News Online reported that many residents of conservative constituencies were launching objections to the HS2 route based on the effects it would have on them, whilst also showing concerns that HS2 is unlikely to have a societal benefit at a macro level under the current economic circumstances. Likewise, Labour MP Natascha Engel—through whose constituency the line will pass—offered a &quot;passionate defence of nimbyism&quot; in the House of Commons, with regards to the effects the line would have on home- and business-owning constituents. HS2 has also been opposed by residents of the Chilterns and Camden who argue that there is an insufficient business case for the line. On 17 March 2014, it was announced that Camden residents were successful in their campaign to prevent the construction of the HS1–HS2 link railway.

====Heathrow Airport====
In November 2007, a consultation process began for the building of a new third runway and a sixth terminal and it was controversially approved on 15 January 2009 by UK government ministers. The project was then cancelled on 12 May 2010 by the Cameron Government. The project was adopted by the House of Commons in June 2018. NIMBYs and political protestors appealed to the courts, but lost in the UK Supreme Court in December 2020.

====Coventry Airport====
Coventry Airport is owned by CAFCO (Coventry) Limited, a joint venture between Howard Holdings plc and Convergence-AFCO Holdings Limited (CAFCOHL). In June 2007, it had its application to build permanent terminal and passenger facilities rejected by the UK government due to public pressure.

====Wimbledon, London====
The London Borough of Merton did not have enough school places for local children who would be reaching school age in 2012 and 2013. Almost all local schools had expanded, but the group &quot;Save Our Rec&quot; (recreation ground) (dedicated in the preservation of green areas in the local community) opposed the expansion of Dundonald School as their interest was focused on protecting one of the few green spaces left in the Borough of Merton. Those that disagreed with the &quot;Save our Rec&quot; group labelled the group NIMBYs. Despite efforts to protect green spaces, the expansion proceeded onto a portion of the park and the park&#x27;s pavilion.

====Portland Migrant Barge====
In April 2023, the UK Government announced a plan to use the engineless barge, the Bibby Stockholm, to house around 500 asylum seekers in Portland Harbour, in an attempt to save money housing asylum seekers. Whilst most of the controversy outside of the town of Portland stemmed from its apparent overcrowding, ethical issues, and economic inefficiency, many protests from the inside of the town were because of impacts on the towns tourism industry, and a possible increase in crime and anti-social behaviour, with some saying it puts the women of the town at risk. They were dubbed as NIMBYs by some facets of the media.

===United States===
Research shows that conservatives and liberals are equally likely to oppose new housing developments in their localities. White neighborhoods and cities tend to favor more restrictive housing development policy. A study in &quot;Perspectives on Politics&quot; found that &quot;individuals who are older, male, longtime residents, voters in local elections, and homeowners are significantly more likely to participate&quot; in local government, and that &quot;these individuals overwhelmingly (and to a much greater degree than the general public) oppose new housing construction.&quot; Nimbys tend to be homeowners, and have been described as acting to keep home prices high in self-interest and as working against their financial interests. Some economists believe that this is due to a public misunderstanding of how the new construction of housing affects housing prices. For example, only 30-40% of Americans believe that new housing construction reduces housing prices, and meanwhile a comparable amount of Americans believe that new construction increases housing prices.

According to a 2017 report from the National Low Income Housing Coalition, there is a shortage of 7.4 million affordable homes available for rent to extremely low income (ELI) households in the United States. As a result, seventy-one percent of ELI households are forced to spend over half of their income on housing costs, leading to severe financial burdens. Despite this apparent need for more affordable housing, opposition from NIMBY activists presents significant challenges to affordable housing developments, resulting in costly design changes, construction delays, and permit denials. However, research suggests that proactive outreach and communication by affordable housing developers and proponents through the leveraging of social marketing and positive messaging can overcome common NIMBY barriers.

====California====
Many local residents (including farmers) in Hanford, California and surrounding areas are opposed to the California High-Speed Rail Authority building high-speed rail near farmland, citing that it will bring environmental and economic problems.

Wealthy residents of southern Orange County, California defeated a local measure that proposed to convert the decommissioned El Toro Marine Base into a commercial airport, claiming that the airport would be &quot;unsafe&quot; during landings and takeoffs, as well as create air quality issues. The real issue was the FAA planned the flight paths for the airport over expensive neighborhoods of south Orange County and residents feared that their property values would decrease. The airport proposal, however, was strongly supported by northern Orange County residents. The defeat of the local measure resulted in the creation of the Orange County Great Park.

For over 60 years, environmentalists, historic preservationists and long-time residents of South Pasadena, California have been opposing the completion of the highly controversial State Route 710 through the cities of Los Angeles (El Sereno), South Pasadena and Pasadena. In 1973, a federal injunction was granted, halting the construction of the surface freeway pending an environmental impact analysis. The Federal Highway Administration withdrew support for the surface freeway in 2003.

On 29 September 2017, 15 housing bills were signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown to combat the state&#x27;s housing shortage. Many of these bills are considered direct attempts to reduce the ability of private citizens to suppress housing construction, even being referred to by some as &quot;Anti-NIMBY&quot; bills.

In 2022, California governor Gavin Newsom declared that &quot;nimbyism is destroying the state&quot; and promised to hold cities and counties accountable for stopping new housing development.

=====San Francisco=====
Nimbyism in San Francisco, including several members of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, has led to a suppression of new housing construction, transit expansion, bike infrastructure, and new retail stores in the city. Nimbys have cited negative impact on local communities, low affordable housing quotas, restrictions on buildings&#x27; shadows, increased car traffic, and concerns with parking as reasons for opposing projects. Those who favor housing developments argue that new housing construction makes housing more affordable, thereby reducing displacement, personal property tax burdens, and homelessness. Examples of nimbyism in San Francisco include 8 Washington housing project, 1846 Grove Street housing, 1060 Folsom housing, 1979 Mission housing, 2675 Folsom housing, 250 Laguna Honda Boulevard housing, 770 Woolsey, UCSF Parnassus Heights hospital expansion, and the Polk Street bike lane.

San Francisco nimbys have also been described as &quot;housing conservatives&quot;.

=====Marin County=====
Many residents of Marin County, an affluent bedroom community in the San Francisco Bay Area, have for many years exemplified the idea of nimbyism through their ardent resistance to housing developments and housing quotas. Residents believe housing developments will lead to increased population density which can lead to increased traffic, increased pollution, crowded schools, a lack of open space, and a poor quality of life.

In 2018, some Marin residents started the NIMBY group Livable California.

====Florida====
A minority of residents in St. Lucie County, Florida have vehemently opposed the construction of wind turbines in the county. The construction of the wind turbines was strongly supported by over 80% of county residents according to a 2008 Florida Power and Light (FPL) poll. Additionally, the power company proposed building the turbines in a location on a beach near a prior existing nuclear power plant owned by the company.

In the 1980s, plans were made to develop a series of east/west highways to connect Palm Beach County&#x27;s suburbs with downtown West Palm Beach. Many residents in the area opposed the plan, largely due to the highway expansion requiring the demolition of over 100 homes. Ultimately, the plan was revised to transform the existing SR-80 (Southern Boulevard) into a full expressway to minimize disruptions to local residents and businesses, however all of the proposals were later abandoned.

====Illinois====
In 1959, when Deerfield officials learned that a developer building a neighborhood of large new homes planned to make houses available to African Americans, they issued a stop-work order. An intense debate began about racial integration, property values, and the good faith of the residents, community officials and builders. For a brief time, Deerfield was spotlighted in the national news as &quot;the Little Rock of the North.&quot; Supporters of integration were denounced and ostracized by residents. Eventually, the village passed a referendum to build parks on the property, thus putting an end to the housing development. Two model homes already partially completed were sold to village officials. Otherwise, the land lay dormant for years before it was developed into what is now Mitchell Pool and Park and Jaycee Park. The first black family did not move into Deerfield until much later, and in years since Deerfield has seen a greater influx of minorities, including Jews, Asians, Greeks and others. This episode in Deerfield&#x27;s history is described in &quot;But Not Next Door&quot; by Harry and David Rosen, both residents of Deerfield.

====Minnesota====

In the late 1990s a proposal for commuter rail on the Dan Patch Corridor between Minneapolis and Northfield was studied. In 2002, due to opposition from neighborhoods along the corridor, two state representatives from the suburbs of Bloomington and Edina passed a legislative ban that prohibited further study, discussion, funding, and construction of the project. Several attempts have been made to lift the ban, and in 2023 it was finally lifted. As of 2023 the communities along the route have no official position on the Dan Patch Corridor except Lakeville, Minnesota, which is opposed.

In 2018, Minneapolis became the first US city to end single-family zoning, with a guiding framework called the &quot;Minneapolis 2040 Comprehensive Plan&quot;. The plan faced years of legal challenges, and eventually required intervention from the state legislature to proceed.

====New York====
In 1858, a group of residents in Staten Island burned down the New York Marine Hospital, at the time the largest quarantine facility in the United States, citing its negative effect on local property values.

On Long Island, various electrification and expansion projects of the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) were substantially delayed due to the protests of people living near the railroad. For example, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority built a third track on the Main Line from Floral Park station to Hicksville station in order to increase capacity. Although most communities along the route supported grade crossing eliminations as part of the project, there was fierce opposition for building a third track from the villages of Floral Park, New Hyde Park, and Garden City, which said the construction and the resulting increased train service will reduce the quality of life in their neighborhoods. The third track project was suspended indefinitely in 2008, but new funding for the project was included in a 2016 infrastructure improvement plan announced by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, which included measures intended to mitigate locals&#x27; concerns. Despite the promise of mitigation efforts, several local politicians denounced the governor&#x27;s plan within a day of its announcement. In December 2017, the LIRR awarded a contract to build the third track. It was completed in October 2022 and a new service pattern was ultimately implemented in February 2023, concurrent with the full opening of Grand Central Madison.

In Port Washington, New York, a dispute broke out between the town of North Hempstead and the LIRR over a proposed yard expansion at Port Washington station. To expand the yard, a parking lot belonging to the town would need to be reduced in size, but a local councilperson stated that the addition of the tracks &quot;will completely ruin the character of the town.&quot; The LIRR was able to expand the yard without the agreement of North Hempstead by tearing up 140 parking spaces of its own parking lot, also adjacent to the station.

Community opposition also led to the cancellation of a proposed extension of the New York City Subway&#x27;s Astoria Line (carrying the ) to LaGuardia Airport. Similarly, opposition has stopped any proposal to build a bridge or tunnel across the Long Island Sound with some believing it will harm their communities with an influx of unwanted traffic as well as concerns regarding the environment and the number of homes that would be cleared as a result.

====Tennessee====
In early 2020, in Campbell County, Tennessee, complaints occurred after an out-of-state company began controlled blasting at a rock quarry in the county. Campbell County Schools had dismissed their schools early due to the quarry, located less than 2,000 feet from the high school, performing a scheduled blast. Residents gathered for pleas to shut down the quarry. Campbell County officials later passed a resolution banning the development of quarries within 2,000 feet of a public building or power grid structure.

In 2009, Norfolk Southern Railway released plans of a proposed intermodal freight transport truck-and-train facility in Jefferson County, Tennessee as a part of the Crescent Corridor project in a private-public partnership with state and Jefferson County officials. The proposed facility, if completed, would have generated 77 on-site jobs, 1,700 related-industry jobs in Jefferson and surrounding counties, and the potential of an annual income of dollars a year. The project received extensive backlash from an organized group of affected property owners and farmers, citing the massive loss of land as a negative impact on Jefferson County&#x27;s agricultural industry. The project status has remained stagnant since 2015, as Norfolk had no plans of constructing the facility in the short-term future, but plans on having the site property as a &quot;long-term investment&quot; according to a press release by the company&#x27;s public relations director.

====Virginia====
In 1994, opposition from residents and historians contributed to the cancellation of the Disney&#x27;s America theme park outside of Haymarket, Virginia.

====Washington====
In 1988, residents of Seattle&#x27;s Broadmoor golf course and gated community successfully opposed the construction of a bike path between Washington Park Arboretum and Madison Park.

==Political implications==
According to &quot;New York Times&quot; opinion writer Farhad Manjoo, &quot;What Republicans want to do with I.C.E. and border walls, wealthy progressive Democrats are doing with zoning and Nimbyism. Preserving “local character,” maintaining “local control,” keeping housing scarce and inaccessible—the goals of both sides are really the same: to keep people out.&quot;

In a 2020 paper exploring the relationship between homeowners&#x27; self-interest and pro-NIMBY attitudes among both self-identified liberals and conservatives, William Marble and Clayton Nall note: “Whether they are responding to different housing policies, responding to persuasive political messaging, or evaluating hypothetical proposals for local development, homeowners remain opposed to local development policies that threaten their self-interest.“

Historian Nancy Shoemaker cites &quot;Not-in-My-Backyard Colonialism&quot; as one of twelve types of colonialism, in which an area is colonized to dispose of convicts or conduct dangerous experiments. She cites Australia and the Marshall Islands—used as a nuclear test site by the United States—as examples.

==Overcoming==
Various means to overcome NIMBY opposition to infrastructure or development have been used, including persuasion, leaving the decision to an appointed board, or broadening the decision-making community (such as by overriding municipal zoning rules with countywide or statewide regulations). Another proposal is to pay neighbors of new housing developments, so that they experience benefits as well as costs, giving them an incentive to express political support.

<text>VR-Group Plc (, ), commonly known as VR, is a government-owned railway company in Finland. VR&#x27;s most important function is the operation of Finland&#x27;s passenger rail services with 250 long-distance and 800 commuter rail services every day. With 7,500 employees and net sales of €1,251 million in 2017, VR is one of the most significant operators in the Finnish public transport market area.

VR was created in 1995 after being known as , Finnish: Suomen Valtion Rautatiet (Finnish State Railways) from 1862 to 1922, and &quot;Valtionrautatiet&quot; (&#x27;State Railways&#x27;, ) from 1922 to 1995.

As part of the concern, Avecra is a subsidiary for onboard catering service, Pohjolan Liikenne for bus traffic, VR Track for developing and maintaining of infrastructure and VR Transpoint for freight. Since 2017, its headquarters is located at the building, previously occupied by the state-owned broadcasting company Yle, in northern-central Helsinki.

==History==

Rail transport started in Finland in 1862 between Helsinki and Hämeenlinna, and multiple main lines and smaller private railways were built in the following decades. VR mainly operated on the high-demand main lines. During the twentieth century, most private railway companies were shut down and VR assumed a monopoly in rail transport. In 1995 the company went through a process of corporatization to become the VR Group.

Since 2010, the maintenance and the construction of the railway network have been the responsibility of the Finnish Transport Infrastructure Agency (). The operation and network were originally carried out by the parent company &quot;Valtionrautatiet&quot; until 1995, when it was split into VR and the rail administration entity Ratahallintokeskus.

==Organization==
Companies in the group provide road freight and bus services, catering and real estate management, and provide data, technological, and telecommunications services for the transport and logistics sectors. The group owns a bus company, Pohjolan Liikenne, and a road freight haulage company VR Transpoint.

Altogether the group includes 21 companies employing a total of about 14,400 people.

==Services==

Because in most parts of Finland the density of population is low, Finland is not optimally suited for railways. Commuter services are nowadays rare outside the Helsinki area, but express trains interconnect most cities. As in France, the majority of passenger services are connections to the capital, Helsinki. In the 2010s, VR has made connections faster by reducing stops at minor stations and increasing running speeds with new locomotives and renovated high-speed trains.

VR provides motorail services. Cars can be loaded onto and unloaded from trains at seven stations: Helsinki, Turku and Tampere in the south, Oulu further north, and Rovaniemi, Kemijärvi and Kolari in Lapland. Car transport trains stop at other stations along the way for normal passenger transport and is available as daily service to Rovaniemi and Kemijärvi and several times a week to Kolari. Finland is the only Nordic country to offer car transport on trains; however, car transport on trains is available in many European countries outside the Nordic countries. In August 2021 VR began operating the Tampere light rail.

In March 2022, VR acquired the Swedish bus and rail company Arriva Sverige, which operates urban transport in Stockholm and regional transport in southern and southeastern Sweden. Arriva Sverige was part of Arriva and owned by Deutsche Bahn. Following the acquisition, it was announced that Arriva Sverige would become an independent company within the VR Group.

===Commuter rail===

VR operates the commuter traffic in the Helsinki area on behalf of HSL and its own commuter rail services in southern Finland.

===International services===
There are plans to open a new passenger rail service between Finland and Sweden in the end of 2024, between Haparanda in northern Sweden and Helsinki. The cross-border railway will be electrified according to Finnish standards by then.

Before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, VR operated jointly with Russian Railways a passenger rail service named Allegro between Helsinki and Saint Petersburg. However due to sanctions imposed on Russia as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, all passenger rail traffic between Finland and Russia has been suspended in March 2022, and the rolling stock has since been parked. These trains were in late 2023 taken over by VR, and are planned to be used in domestic traffic in Finland beginning 2025.

If and when the proposed Helsinki–Tallinn Tunnel is built, trains may be run by VR, Elron or a joint-venture similar to the former arrangement with Russia.

===Freight===
Domestic and international freight services are provided by VR Transpoint, a part of VR. In 2009, both domestic and international freight traffic declined, which worsened VR&#x27;s financial position. International freight traffic was concentrated to the four railways across the Russian border but there is also a connection to the Swedish rail network through Tornio. Train ferry connections from Turku to Stockholm, Sweden, and to Travemünde, Germany have previously existed.

==Rolling stock==


=== Locomotives ===

VR operated steam locomotives until 1975. Although the regular use of steam traction for scheduled passenger services ended in 1970, occasional use continued until 1975. As of 2011, the company operates two classes of electric locomotives (Sr1 and Sr2) and three classes of diesel locomotives (Dv12, Dr14 and Dr16). The use of diesel locomotive hauled passenger trains has declined due to electrification of all main lines and the (re)introduction of railbuses (Dm12) on secondary routes.

In October 2010, VR announced plans to renew its locomotive fleet by ordering around 200 new locomotives, which are expected to enter service in 2015–25.

On 20 December 2013, VR announced plans to purchase 80 new electric locomotives, with 97 options. The upcoming Sr3 will be based on the Vectron and will replace the aging Sr1. The locomotives will be fitted with helper diesel engines that can be used for shunting in partly unelectrified railyards. Deliveries will occur between 2017 and 2026.

==== Locomotive classification system ====

At the beginning of traffic, locomotives were distinguished by their names, and by 1865 also by their numbers. In 1887, the locomotives were given their original classification system. It was based on the wheel arrangement of the locomotives: each wheel arrangement was assigned a letter of the alphabet, which was followed by a serial number. The assignment of letters to different wheel arrangements was made when the first locomotive using it was brought into service; the letter A signified a 4-4-0 wheelbase in the Whyte notation, B signified a 0-4-2ST locomotive, C a 0-6-0 locomotive, and so on.

On 8 October 1942, the notation system was changed to two letters and a serial number. The first letter in the designation now signified the types of trains the locomotive was generally planned to haul:
* H () for passenger trains,
* P () for local (commuter) trains,
* T () for freight trains,
* S () for mixed freight-passenger trains and
* V (&quot;vaihto&quot;, literally &quot;switch&quot;) for a switcher locomotive.
The second small letter indicated the weight of the locomotive:
* r (raskas) = heavy (axle load over 14.1 t)
* v (väliraskas) = midweight (axle load 11.1–14.0 t)
* k (kevyt) = light (axle load under 11.0 t)
* m = mechanical transmission (in multiple units)
* s (sähkö &#x27;electric(ity)&#x27;) = electrical transmission (in multiple units).

When diesel locomotives were taken into service in the 1950s, they were additionally differentiated by the steam locomotive classes by beginning their numbering from 11 instead of the next free number in running order. As a result, the last steam-powered heavy passenger locomotive class was designated Hr3, and its first diesel-powered counterpart Hr11.

The current VR locomotive classification system was taken into use on 1 January 1976. The first (capital) letter was now used to differentiate between locomotive types: S () for electric, D for diesel and T () for maintenance equipment. The serial numbers of diesel locomotive classes were not changed, the Hr11 class becoming Dr11. In addition to this the borderline between midweight and heavy locomotives was changed to 15.1 tons and the second letter in multiple units is always m (for ).

===Carriages===

The wide Finnish loading gauge allows the passenger coaches to be considerably wider than most European passenger coaches. The aisle and seats are wider than in other European trains in the standard 2+2 configuration, and in commuter traffic 3+2 seat configuration is used to allow more seats for the same train length. The last wooden-bodied carriages were withdrawn by the mid-1980s. Prior to the 1970s these had been the mainstay of VR&#x27;s passenger rolling stock.

VR has three types of locomotive hauled passenger coaches:

* Double-deck InterCity carriages are the common coaches in the long-distance trains and the mainstay of VR&#x27;s network. There are several variants, including coaches with first class service, family-friendly coaches and coaches with bike as baggage capability. The coaches are built in Finland by Transtech Oy and they VR&#x27;s most modern carriages. More coaches has been ordered to replace the last blue carriages and to increase capacity on the most popular routes. Their top speed is 200 km/h.
* Single-deck InterCity carriages are used to increase capacity whenever double-deck coaches are not available. Top speed is 200 km/h.
*&quot;Blue&quot; carriages, as they are popularly known as such due to their blue and light gray liveries, are used on night express trains from Helsinki to Kolari and Kemijärvi. Top speed is 140 or 160 km/h.

In addition to these, VR has ordered 12+13 Class Edo control cars from Transtech, eight of which have been in regular passenger traffic since 29 October 2013. The cars are used in InterCity connections with the Sr2 and the upcoming Sr3 locomotives pushing the train.

First class, or &quot;Extra&quot; as VR calls it, is marked with Extra signs outside of the coaches on InterCity trains. Even restaurant coaches are marked similarly.

On the &quot;Blue&quot; carriages, first class used to be distinguished by a yellow stripe above the windows and restaurant cars by a red stripe. Cars equipped with diesel generators, which are used to provide electricity to InterCity or sleeper wagons on non-electrified tracks, can be distinguished by a blue stripe above the windows.

====Sleeper cars====

VR operates sleeper services between Helsinki/Turku and Lapland, which also include car-carrying (motorail) wagons. Double-deck sleeping carriages (including rooms with &quot;en suite&quot; showers and toilets) were introduced on the Helsinki–Rovaniemi service in the 2000s. These wagons are painted in a green-and-white livery similar to the InterCity coaches. Since 2016, the new coaches have begun to replace the blue carriages even on the way to Kolari.

Electrification extends from Oulu northwards to Kemijärvi. In 2006, direct sleeper services were discontinued beyond Rovaniemi (to Kemijärvi) because the new double-deck sleeping carriages were unable to operate with diesel haulage. The sleeper service to Kemijärvi was restarted in March 2008, by adding to the train in Rovaniemi a new diesel generator car supplying 1 500 V electricity for the sleeper cars between Rovaniemi and Kemijärvi; this setup was continued in use until the electrification extension to Kemijärvi was completed at the end of 2013. Sleeper services between Turku and Joensuu and Helsinki and Kajaani were withdrawn in 2006, but with the new direct line between Lahti and Kerava, the daytime services were made quicker.

On 12 January 2009, VR announced they had requested tenders for the purchase of 20 new sleeping cars, valued at €60–70 million. The two bidders interested were Alstom, which manufactures the Pendolino and some commuter trains for VR, and Finnish Transtech, which manufactured VR&#x27;s new sleeping cars. The decision led to the resignation of the President and CEO of VR-Group, Henri Kuitunen, and the group&#x27;s Chairman of the Board, Antti Lagerroos. Helsingin Sanomat reported they had wanted to defer the replacement of older sleeping car rolling stock until 2012 at the earliest. However, the decision went ahead because VR is a state owned business and there was pressure to seek orders from Finnish Transtech, which is currently struggling due to market downturns, in order to secure jobs.

===Freight wagons===
The Finnish loading gauge allows the operation of freight vehicles considerably larger than most other railways in the European Union. Road trailers (often of VR&#x27;s subsidiary Transpoint) can be easily accommodated on ordinary flat wagons. Much of the freight on the VR network is carried from Russia in Russian wagons, including large capacity eight-axle oil tank wagons.

VR also has a one-third ownership of SeaRail, a specialist operator of freight wagons designed for through running (via ferry) to Sweden and elsewhere in Western Europe.

===Multiple units===

The Sm3 class Pendolino is the VR&#x27;s &quot;flagship&quot;, mainly connecting largest cities to the capital with top running speed up to 220 km/h. Other EMUs in use are the Sm2 and Sm4 on commuter rail services. In addition, VR operates Pääkaupunkiseudun Junakalusto Oy -owned Sm5 class EMUs in Helsinki local traffic.

VR currently operates one class of diesel-powered multiple units: the Czech-built single carriage Dm12, which is used mainly on secondary lines.


====Multiple unit classification system====
The multiple unit classification system follows a similar logic as the locomotive classification system: the first letter signifies the power source (in addition to electric and diesel, gasoline (B, &quot;bensiini&quot;) and wood gas (P, &quot;puukaasu&quot;) have been used), followed by the letter m (&quot;moottorivaunu&quot;) signifyng a multiple unit, followed by a serial number.

== Operations in Sweden ==
In July 2022, VR Group established operations in Sweden by acquiring Arriva Sverige AB from the German state-owned company Deutsche Bahn. As part of this acquisition, which was finalised on 1st July 2022, VR Group gained control over extensive local and regional public transportation operations, including bus, tram and train services in Stockholm, Östergötland, and Skåne, including Skånetrafiken&#x27;s Pågatåg. This acquisition brought approximately 2,300 employees into the VR Group. The acquired operations include 740 buses, 180 trains, and 70 trams, facilitating around 58 million bus journeys and 54 million train journeys annually. 

Following the acquisition, Arriva Sverige was rebranded as VR Sverige and operates under the VR Group brand. Since 2022, VR has grown in Sweden with contracts that include train services in regions like Bergslagen and Gävleborg. VR Sverige also secured a 10-year contract to operate bus services for SL in Tyresö, Stockholm, beginning in July 2025. This contract is valued at approximately €215 million and involves around 190 employees.

In addition to the purchase of Arriva Sweden, VR Group has also strengthened its presence in the Swedish rail market through the acquisition of MTRX, a high-speed train operator on the Stockholm-Gothenburg route. Acquired in 2024, MTRX was rebranded as VR Snabbtåg Sverige and became part of VR Group’s long-distance operations. The MTRX acquisition included six Stadler Flirt X74 EMUs, which operate over 120 weekly services on the route.

==Livery==

VR has used several liveries in the past. When InterCity traffic started during the 1980s, VR&#x27;s colour scheme was changed to red and white. In 2009, VR changed its corporate colour to green and all the coaches have been repainted in green and white except the Cemt and Eifet carriages.

<text>UPM-Kymmene Oyj is a Finnish forest industry company. UPM-Kymmene was formed by the merger of Kymmene Corporation with Repola Oy and its subsidiary United Paper Mills Ltd in 1996. UPM consists of six business areas: UPM Fibres, UPM Energy, UPM Raflatac, UPM Specialty Papers, UPM Communication Papers and UPM Plywood. The Group employs around 17,000 people and it has production plants in 11 countries. UPM shares are listed on the NASDAQ OMX Helsinki stock exchange. UPM is the only paper company which is listed in the global Dow Jones Sustainability Index and also a member of the United Nations Global Compact organization.

UPM is the owner and maintainer of the Verla mill, which has been a museum since 1972 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1996.

==History==

The company&#x27;s oldest mill was Papeteries de Docelles located in northeastern France, which produced traditional handpaper at the end of 15th century. The mill got its first paper making machine in the 1830s. UPM Docelles was disbanded in 2014.

The company has a long tradition of forest industries in Finland. There the company&#x27;s first paper mills and sawmills were put into operation in the beginning of the 1870s. Pulp manufacturing began in the 1880s and paper converting in the 1920s. The company started manufacturing plywood in the 1930s. Several Finnish forest industry companies have merged with the forerunner companies of UPM, such as: Walkiakoski, Jämsänkoski, Kaukas, Halla, Kajaani, Toppila, Kymmene, Kuusankoski, Kymi, Voikkaa, Lohjan Paperi Oy, Wilh. Schauman, W. Rosenlew, Raf. Haarla and Myllykoski.

The company logo, the griffin, was designed by Hugo Simberg in 1899. It is probable that the griffin was chosen as the company logo because it represents a guardian of the northern forests. The griffin logo is the oldest continuous company logo in Finland.

===2000–2010===
Due to worldwide overproduction of paper UPM announced a cost reduction program in 2006. Voikkaa paper mill in Kuusankoski was closed. Nearly 3,000 employees in Finland were laid off. After the closure the area has been transformed into Voikkaa business area.

The Miramichi paper mill in New Brunswick, which UPM acquired in 2000, was closed in 2007. Also a number of plywood mills and sawmills were closed during the years. In December 2008 UPM closed Kajaani paper mill and Tervasaari pulp mill in Valkeakoski. 1,100 employees were laid off. The former premises of the Kajaani mill were turned into a business park called Renforsin Ranta.

===2011–2020===
The overcapacity continued in graphic paper business and in 2011, UPM acquired Myllykoski Corporation and Rhein Papier GmbH, which consists of seven publication paper mills in Germany, Finland and the United States. In France, UPM closed Stracel paper mill in 2013 and Docelles paper mill in 2014. Madison paper mill in the USA was closed in 2016.The Schwedt paper mill in Germany was sold in 2017. Specialty paper production expanded to China and Germany in 2015 and 2019, respectively. Kaipola paper mill in Finland was closed in 2020.

In 2015, the production of wood-based biofuels started at the biorefinery in Lappeenranta, Finland.

In July 2019, UPM announced that it will invest US$2.7 billion in a eucalyptus pulp mill near Paso de los Toros in central Uruguay. The new pulp mill was started up in April 2023 with a total investment of US$3.47 billion and has a production capacity of 2.1 million tonnes of pulp per year. This is the second pulp mill the company opened in Uruguay, after the UPM Fray Bentos, which makes 1.3 million tonnes of pulp per year.

In January 2020, UPM announced that it will invest EUR 550 million in an industrial scale biorefinery to convert solid wood into next-generation biochemicals: bio-monoethylene glycol (BioMEG) and lignin-based renewable functional fillers. The biorefinery will also produce bio-monopropyleneglycol (BioMPG) and industrial sugars. The total annual capacity of the biorefinery will be 220,000 tonnes. The facility is scheduled to start up by the end of 2023. The capital expenditure estimate has been increased to EUR 750 million.

=== Table of production sites ===


== Biofuels ==
UPM is developing new business on wood based biofuels for transport. The brand name for the biofuels of UPM is UPM BioVerno. The production concepts are based on non-food raw materials and they result in a significant reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The UPM Biofuels surpass both the EU and Finnish requirements for sustainable biofuels.

===Biorefinery===
UPM has invested in a biorefinery producing biofuels from crude tall oil in Lappeenranta, Finland. The biorefinery produces annually approximately 130,000 tonnes of advanced second generation biodiesel for transport. Construction of the biorefinery began in the summer of 2012 at UPM&#x27;s Kaukas mill site and was completed in 2014. UPM&#x27;s total investment amounted to approximately EUR 179 million. The construction of the biorefinery offered work for nearly 200 people for approximately two years. The biorefinery directly employs nearly 50 people and indirectly about 150 people.

Development is currently ongoing, with the aim of expanding the biofuels business with new types of technology concepts and biomass-based raw materials. In January 2021, UPM started the basic engineering phase of a potential new biorefinery, with site option assessment primarily in two locations: Kotka, Finland and Rotterdam, the Netherlands. In January 2022 UPM decided that the work continues in Rotterdam.

UPM Plywood has developed a new way to manufacture layered composites and the new form of plywood is called UPM Grada. At the core of the new technology is a special adhesive film, which allows the plywood to be formed after manufacturing. UPM Grada Plywood can be safely recycled or burned at the end of its lifecycle. UPM Grada Plywood can be used e.g. in furniture. The Finnish furniture manufacturer Isku has introduced the new Kaava chair which demonstrates the capabilities of UPM Grada Plywood.

===UPM ProFi===
UPM ProFi composite is a Biofore material that combines the characteristics of cellulose fibres and plastic. Manufactured mainly from recycled raw material, the composite is suitable for use in patios, terraces, piers and playgrounds. The material does not require polishing, lacquer finishing or other surface finishing. The material was a result of UPM&#x27;s own research and product development.
UPM ProFi has been used in the manufacture of a pedestrian walkway in the previously historic city of Ghent, Belgium.

===UPM Formi===
UPM Formi is a recyclable and odorless composite which can be used to replace plastic in many instances. UPM Formi composite granulates are manufactured from clean polymers and pulp. UPM offers the granulates in three grades for injection molding – Formi GP for general use, Formi SP for special surface, and Formi TP for technical applications. The UPM Formi -material has already been used in the manufacture of a mobile phone microscope, launched by KeepLoop Oy. The Finnish company, MySoda, designs and manufactures the first-ever sparkling water makers made of wood-based biocomposite, UPM Formi EcoAce. The biocomposite is made using certified renewable fibres and polymers derived from UPM BioVerno naphtha.

<doc id="231734" wikidata="Q80732" url="?curid=231734" title="Tenzing Norgay">
<text>Tenzing Norgay (; &quot;tendzin norgyé&quot;; May 1914 – 9 May 1986), born Namgyal Wangdi, and also referred to as Sherpa Tenzing, was a Nepalese-Indian Sherpa mountaineer. On 29 May 1953, he and Edmund Hillary were the first confirmed to have reached the summit of Mount Everest, as part of the 1953 British Mount Everest expedition. &quot;Time&quot; named Norgay one of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century.

==Early life==
There are conflicting accounts of Tenzing&#x27;s early life. In his autobiography, he wrote that he was a Sherpa born and raised in Tengboche, Khumbu, in northeastern Nepal. In a 1985 interview with All India Radio, he said his parents came from Tibet, but that he was born in Nepal. According to many later accounts, including a book co-written by his son Jamling Tenzin Norgay, he was born in Tibet, at Tse Chu in the Kama Valley, and grew up in Thame. He spent his early childhood in Kharta, near the north of the country. Norgay went to Nepal as a child to work for a Sherpa family in Khumbu.

Khumbu lies near Mount Everest, which the Tibetans and Sherpas call &quot;Chomolungma&quot;; in Standard Tibetan, that name means &quot;Holy Mother&quot;, or the goddess of the summit. Buddhism is the traditional religion of the Sherpas and Tibetans, and Norgay was Buddhist.

Although his exact date of birth is unknown, he knew it was in late May by the weather and the crops. After his ascent of Everest on 29 May 1953, he decided to celebrate his birthday on that day thereafter. His year of birth, according to the Tibetan calendar, was the Year of the Rabbit, making it likely that he was born in 1914. This agrees with Hunt&#x27;s statement that he was 39 in 1953, and had &quot;established himself (as) not only the foremost climber of his race but as a mountaineer of world standing&quot;.

Tenzing was originally called &quot;Namgyal Wangdi&quot;, but as a child his name was changed on the advice of the head lama and founder of Rongbuk Monastery, Ngawang Tenzin Norbu. &quot;Tenzing Norgay&quot; translates as &quot;wealthy-fortunate-follower-of-religion&quot;. His father, a Tibetan yak herder, was Ghang La Mingma (d. 1949), and his mother, who was Tibetan, was Dokmo Kinzom. She lived to see him climb Everest. Tenzing was the 11th of 13 children, several of whom died young.

Tenzing ran away from home twice in his teens, first to Kathmandu and later to Darjeeling, India (which at that time was the starting point for most expeditions in the eastern Himalayas), and eventually acquired Indian citizenship. He was once sent to Tengboche Monastery to become a monk, but he decided that was not for him and left. At the age of 19 he settled in the Sherpa community in the Too Song Busti district of Darjeeling.

==Mountaineering==
Norgay received his first opportunity to join an Everest expedition at age 20, when Eric Shipton was assembling the 1935 British Mount Everest reconnaissance expedition. After two other prospective team members failed their medical tests, Norgay was pushed forward by his friend Ang Tharkay, a Sherpa &quot;sirdar&quot; who had been on the 1933 British Mount Everest expedition. His attractive smile caught the eye of Shipton, who decided to take him on.

Norgay participated as a high-altitude porter in three official British attempts to climb Everest from the northern Tibetan side in the 1930s. On the 1936 expedition, he worked with John Morris. He also took part in other climbs in various parts of the Indian subcontinent. For a time in the early 1940s, Norgay lived in the princely state of Chitral (then in India, later a part of Pakistan) as batman to a Major Chapman. Norgay&#x27;s first wife died and was buried there during his sojourn in the state. He returned to Darjeeling with his two daughters during the Indian partition of 1947, and managed to cross India by train without a ticket and without being challenged by wearing one of Major Chapman&#x27;s old uniforms.

In 1947, Norgay participated in an unsuccessful summit attempt of Everest. The Canadian-born mountaineer Earl Denman, Ange Dawa Sherpa, and Norgay entered Tibet illegally to attempt the climb, an attempt which ended when a strong storm hit at . Denman admitted defeat, and all three turned around, returning safely. In 1947, Norgay became a &quot;sirdar&quot; of a Swiss expedition for the first time after having helped to rescue Sirdar Wangdi Norbu, who had fallen and been seriously injured. The expedition reached the main summit of Kedarnath at in the western Garhwal Himalaya with Norgay among the summit party. In 1951 he joined the 1951 British Mount Everest reconnaissance expedition.

==1952 Swiss Mount Everest expedition==

In 1952, he took part in the two Swiss expeditions led by Edouard Wyss-Dunant (spring) and Gabriel Chevalley (autumn), the first serious attempts to climb Everest from the southern (Nepalese) side, after two previous US and British reconnaissance expeditions in 1950 and 1951. Raymond Lambert and Tenzing Norgay were able to reach a height of about on the southeast ridge, setting a new climbing altitude record. The expedition opened up a new route on Everest that was successfully climbed the next year. Norgay and Raymond Lambert reached on 28 May the then-record height of , and this expedition, during which Norgay was for the first time considered a full expedition member (&quot;the greatest honour that had ever been paid me&quot;) forged a lasting friendship between Norgay and his Swiss friends, in particular Raymond Lambert. During the autumn expedition, the team was stopped by bad weather after reaching an altitude of .

==Success on Mount Everest==
In 1953, Tenzing Norgay took part in John Hunt&#x27;s expedition; Tenzing had previously been to Everest six times (and Hunt three). A member of the team was Edmund Hillary, who fell into a crevasse but was saved from hitting the bottom by Norgay&#x27;s prompt action in securing the rope using his ice axe, which led Hillary to consider him the climbing partner of choice for any future summit attempt.

At the time, newspaper reports variously referred to him as Tensing, Tenzing, Tenzing Bhotia, Tenzing Norgay, Tensing Norkey, Tenzing Sherpa or Dan Shin, as one Indian academic suggested.

The Hunt expedition totalled over 400 people, including 362 porters, 20 Sherpa guides and of baggage, and like many such expeditions, was a team effort.

The expedition set up base camp in March 1953. Hillary wrote in 1975 about first meeting Norgay in Kathmandu on 5 March 1953:

Working slowly, the expedition set up their penultimate camp at the South Col, at . On 26 May, Tom Bourdillon and Charles Evans attempted the climb, but turned back when Evans&#x27; oxygen system failed. The pair had reached the South Summit, coming within 300 vertical feet (91 m) of the summit. Hunt then directed Norgay and Hillary to go for the summit.

Snow and wind held the pair up at the South Col for two days. They set out on 28 May with a support trio comprising Ang Nyima, Alfred Gregory and George Lowe. Norgay and Hillary pitched a tent at on 28 May while their support group returned down the mountain. On the following morning, Hillary discovered that his boots had frozen solid outside the tent. He spent two hours warming them before he and Tenzing attempted the final ascent, wearing packs. The last part of the ascent comprised a rock face later named the &quot;Hillary Step&quot;. Hillary saw a means to wedge his way up a crack in the face between the rock wall and the ice, and Norgay followed.

From there, the following effort was relatively simple. They reached Everest&#x27;s summit, the highest point on Earth, at 11:30 a.m. As Hillary put it, &quot;A few more whacks of the ice axe in the firm snow, and we stood on top.&quot;
They spent only about 15 minutes at the summit. Hillary took the famous photo of Norgay posing with his ice-axe, but since Norgay had never used a camera, Hillary&#x27;s ascent went unrecorded. However, according to Norgay&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Man of Everest&quot;, when Norgay offered to take Hillary&#x27;s photograph Hillary declined—&quot;I motioned to Hillary that I would now take his picture. But for some reason he shook his head; he did not want it.&quot; Additional photos were taken looking down the mountain, in order to re-assure that they had made it to the top and to document that the ascent was not faked. The two had to take care on the descent after discovering that drifting snow had covered their tracks, complicating the task of retracing their steps. The first person they met was Lowe, who had climbed up to meet them with hot soup.

Afterwards, Norgay was met with great adulation in Nepal and India. Hillary and Hunt were knighted by Queen Elizabeth II, while Norgay received the George Medal for his efforts on the expedition. It has been suggested that Indian prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru refused permission for Norgay to be knighted.

Nonetheless, there was some inequity, according to &quot;National Geographic&quot;,&quot;Hillary was knighted for being the first known person to climb to the top of Mount Everest. But Tenzing, who simultaneously reached its summit, only received an honorary medal. In the years since there&#x27;s been growing disquiet at the lack of official recognition.&quot;

Norgay and Hillary were the first people to conclusively set foot on the summit of Mount Everest, but journalists were persistently repeating the question: &quot;Which of the two men had the right to the glory of being the first one, and who was merely the second, the follower?&quot; Colonel Hunt, the expedition leader, declared, &quot;They reached it together, as a team.&quot;

Norgay eventually ended the speculation by revealing that Hillary was first in his 1955 autobiography. It was ghost-written by American writer James Ramsay Ullman as Tenzing could speak several languages but could not read or write. They were roped six feet apart, with most of the 30 foot rope in loops in his hand:
==After Everest==
Tenzing Norgay became the first Director of Field Training of the Himalayan Mountaineering Institute in Darjeeling, when it was set up in 1954.
In January 1975, with permission of the King of Bhutan, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, Norgay served as &quot;sirdar&quot; (guide) for the first American tourist party allowed into the country. Brought together by a company then called Mountain Travel (now called Mountain Travel-Sobek), the group first met Norgay in India before beginning the trek. The official trek began in Paro, northern Bhutan and included a visit to Tiger&#x27;s Nest (Paro Taktsang), the ancient Buddhist monastery, before returning to India via Nepal and Sikkim. Norgay even introduced his group to the King of Sikkim (the last king of Sikkim, as Sikkim is now a part of India) and also brought them to his home in India for a farewell celebration.

In 1978 Norgay founded Tenzing Norgay Adventures, a company providing trekking adventures in the Himalayas. As of 2021, the company was run by his son Jamling Tenzing Norgay, who himself reached the summit of Everest in 1996.

On 10 May 1984 Tenzing Norgay, together with Grp Capt A. J. S. Grewal, Principal of the Himalayan Mountaineering Institute, attended the 10th-anniversary celebrations of The School of Adventure, Mysore, Karnataka held at the Mysore Institution of Engineers&#x27; auditorium.

==Honours==
In 1938, after Norgay&#x27;s third Everest expedition as a porter, the Himalayan Club awarded him its Tiger Medal for high-altitude work.

On 7 June 1953, it was announced that the newly crowned Queen Elizabeth II wished to recognize Norgay&#x27;s achievements. 10 Downing Street announced on 1 July that, following consultation with the governments of India and Nepal, the Queen had approved awarding Norgay the George Medal. He also received, along with the rest of the Everest party, the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal. In May 2013, Norgay&#x27;s grandson, Tashi Tenzing, said he believed his grandfather should have been knighted, not just given &quot;a bloody medal&quot;.

In 1953, King Tribhuvan of Nepal presented him with the Order of the Star of Nepal, 1st Class (&quot;Supradipta-Manyabara-Nepal-Tara&quot;).

In 1959, the Government of India awarded him the Padma Bhushan, the third-highest civilian award of India. Indian Mountaineering Foundation presented him with its gold medal.

On 1 March 1963, Norgay was awarded the honorary title of &quot;Merited Master of Sport of the USSR&quot; by the Soviet Union, becoming the first foreigner to receive this distinction.

In September 2013, the Government of Nepal proposed naming a mountain in Nepal Tenzing Peak in Norgay&#x27;s honour. Both Tenzing Peak and Hillary Peak are points on the long Ridge from Cho Oyu to Gyuchung Kang with Tenzing Peak nearer to Cho Oyu.

In July 2015, the highest-known, mountain range on the dwarf planet Pluto was named Tenzing Montes.

== Personal life and death ==

Norgay was married three times. His first wife, Dawa Phuti, died young in 1944. They had a son, Nima Dorje, who died at the age of four, and two daughters: Pem Pem, whose son, Tashi Tenzing, climbed Everest, and Nima, who married a Filipino graphic designer, Noli Galang.

Norgay&#x27;s second wife was Ang Lahmu, a cousin of his first wife. They had no biological children, but she was adoptive mother to their daughters from his earlier marriage with her cousin.

His third wife was Dakku, whom he married while his second wife was still alive, as allowed by Sherpa custom (see polygyny). They had three sons (Norbu, Jamling and Dhamey), and one daughter, Deki, who married American lawyer Clark Trainor. Jamling would join Peter Hillary, Edmund Hillary&#x27;s son, in climbing Everest in 2003 on the 50th anniversary of their fathers&#x27; climb.

Other relatives include Norgay&#x27;s nephews, Nawang Gombu and Topgay, who took part in the 1953 Everest expedition; and his grandsons, Tashi Tenzing, who lives in Sydney, Australia, and the Trainor grandsons: Tenzing, Kalden, and Yonden. Tenzing Trainor is an actor who appeared on the Disney Channel comedy &quot;Liv and Maddie&quot;.
Norgay died of a cerebral hemorrhage in Darjeeling, West Bengal, India, on 9 May 1986 at the age of 71. His remains were cremated in the Himalayan Mountaineering Institute, Darjeeling, his favourite haunt. His widow, Dakku, died in 1992.

<text>The is a Japanese group of manufacturing companies. They are the world&#x27;s largest zipper manufacturer, also producing other fastening products, architectural products, plastic hardware and industrial machinery.

The initials YKK stand for , which was the name of the company from 1945 until 1994. YKK produces fasteners and architectural products at 112 YKK facilities in 70 countries worldwide.

==History==

===Before World War II===
What would later become YKK operated initially as San-es Shokai and was founded by Tadao Yoshida in Higashi Nihonbashi, Tokyo in January 1934. The company specialized in marketing of fastening products. In February 1938, San-es Shokai was renamed to Yoshida Kogyosho. WWII was underway by 1939, and the next major corporate event would not take place until February 1942 when the company reorganized as a limited corporation.

===After World War II===
In January 1946, the company registered the YKK trademark. A major technological change came in 1950, when the company purchased a chain machine from the U.S. that allowed the automation of the zipper making process. Previously, YKK zippers were made by hand, and hence had an inferior quality compared to automated zippers from abroad.

In March 1951, YKK relocated its headquarters to Chūō, Tokyo. In May 1955, a new plant was opened in Kurobe, Toyama. In August 1958, the headquarters was again relocated to Taitō, Tokyo. In this year, the company also introduced its new &quot;Conceal&quot; brand that does not show the teeth of the zippers. Another major step came in November 1959, with the opening of its first overseas location, producing YKK zippers in New Zealand. YKK&#x27;s first US office opened in New York City in 1960 and is now the country&#x27;s top supplier of zippers and other fastening devices such as snaps and buttons. As the company grew, it brought every step of manufacturing in-house, including smelting brass and dyeing cloth.

===Diversification===
In November 1961, the product line was diversified to include aluminium products for buildings. In June 1963, the company relocated its headquarters again to Chiyoda, Tokyo, the current location of the company. In 1966, a new product &quot;YZip&quot; was introduced, an extra strong and durable zipper for jeans. The development of a machine that automatically included the &quot;YZip&quot; zipper into the stitching process of jeans further increased sales, especially in the USA. In 1968, YKK opened its first branch in Canada. Its Canadian headquarters are currently in Montreal, Quebec. There was further expansion in the 1970s, with the opening of three new plants in Utazu, Kagawa in April 1972, in Sanbongi, Miyagi in June 1974, and in Yatsushiro, Kumamoto in February 1975. YKK also opened a fastener-making factory in Eswatini which has grown to supply the entire sub-Saharan region, including Madagascar and Mauritius.

More product lines became available with the &quot;Quicklon&quot; (sometimes called &quot;Cosmolon&quot;) fasteners in December 1981. International and product expansion continued during the 1980s, with a real estate business in Singapore in December 1984, an agricultural business in Brazil in January 1985, and a plant in Indonesia in September 1986 producing zippers and aluminium parts for buildings. The company was finally renamed &quot;YKK&quot; in August 1994.

===New millennium===
In July 2000, the company established &quot;YKK Newmax Co., Ltd&quot;, specializing in the production of snaps and buttons. In December 2002, a machine company was established in Suzhou, China. In April 2003, a research and development facility was established in Hokkaido, Japan. A company specializing in sales, &quot;YKK Fastening Products Sales Inc.&quot; was established in February 2003. &quot;YKK AP Inc.&quot; was founded in October 2003, specializing in architectural products.
Overall, the organization operates 111 affiliated companies in 71 countries, with 42,154 employees.

====Price fixing====
On September 19, 2007, YKK was fined €150.3 million by the European Commission for running worldwide price-fixing cartels and sharing markets with zipper-makers Prym and Coats. Coats of Britain and Prym of Germany were fined €122.4 million and €40.5 million respectively for their participation in cartel behaviour. YKK lost its appeal to the General Court on June 27, 2012. It then launched an appeal to the European Court of Justice on September 5, 2012.

In October 2014, part of the fine was reduced by the European high court from €19.25 million to €2.79 million.

<text>Issyk-Kul () or Ysyk-Köl (, ; ) is an endorheic saline lake in the western Tianshan Mountains in eastern Kyrgyzstan, just south of a dividing range separating Kyrgyzstan from Kazakhstan. It is the eighth-deepest lake in the world, the eleventh-largest lake in the world by volume (though not in surface area), the deepest lake whose deepest point is above sea level (939 meters or 3,080 feet), and the third-largest saline lake. Although it is located at a lofty elevation of and subject to severe cold during winter, it rarely freezes over due to high salinity, hence its name, which in the Kyrgyz language means &quot;warm lake&quot;.

The lake is a Ramsar site of globally significant biodiversity and forms part of the Issyk-Kul Biosphere Reserve.

==Geography==
Issyk-Kul Lake is long, up to wide and its surface area is . It is the second-largest mountain lake in the world behind Lake Titicaca in South America. It is at an altitude of and reaches in depth.

About 118 rivers and streams flow into the lake; the largest are the Jyrgalang and Tüp. It is fed by springs, including many hot springs and snow melt. The lake has no current outlet, but some hydrologists hypothesize that the lake&#x27;s water filters deep underground into the Chu River. The bottom of the lake contains the mineral monohydrocalcite: one of the few known lacustrine deposits.

The lake&#x27;s southern shore is dominated by the ruggedly beautiful Teskey Ala-Too Range of the Tian Shan mountains. The northern slopes of the range are long and send a considerable flow to Issyk-Kul. Numerous streams taking their rise at the slopes flow together into comparatively large rivers. They deeply dissect the range and flow in wide valleys. On exit from mountains the rivers form large alluvial cones. In eastern part of Issyk-Kul they flow into Jyrgalang river. 
The Kungey Alatau of the Tian Shan runs parallel to the north shore. The southern slopes of the Kungey Alatau are comparatively short. Therefore, the rivers rising on them are relatively small and do not have a chance to flow together to form larger hydrographic systems. As a result, they separately empty either into Issyk-Kul or into Tüp river flowing along the range.

The lake water&#x27;s salinity is approx. 0.6% – compared to 3.5% salinity of typical seawater – and, although the lake level is still currently some 8 metres (26 ft) higher than in medieval times, its level now drops by approximately per year due to water diversion.

Administratively, the lake and the adjacent land are within Issyk-Kul Region of Kyrgyzstan.

==Tourism==
During the Soviet era, the lake became a popular vacation resort, with numerous sanitoria, boarding houses and vacation homes along its northern shore, many concentrated in and around the town of Cholpon-Ata. These fell on hard times after the break-up of the USSR, but now hotel complexes are being refurbished and simple private bed-and-breakfast rentals are being established for a new generation of health and leisure visitors.

The city of Karakol (formerly Przhevalsk, after the Russian explorer Przhevalsky, who died there) is the administrative seat of Issyk-Kul Region of Kyrgyzstan. It is near the east tip of the lake and is a good base for excursions into the surrounding area. Its small old core contains an impressive wooden mosque, built without metal nails by the Dungan people and a wooden Orthodox church that was used as a stable during Soviet times.

==History==

Issyk-Kul Lake was a stopover on the Silk Road, a land route for travelers from the Far East to Europe. The great Chinese Buddhist scholar-monk Xuanzang passed by this lake and noted the details in the classic travelogue &quot;Great Tang Records on the Western Regions&quot; in the 7th century. The lake was once a part of the territory of Qing dynasty of China and was ceded to Russia – along with the surrounding territory – after the Treaty of Tarbagatai.

Many historians believe that the lake was the point of origin for the Black Death that plagued Europe and Asia during the early and mid-14th century. In 2022, researchers reported on the analysis of preserved genetic material from seven individuals buried in two cemeteries near Issyk-Kul and determined that the Black Death was present there in 1338 or 1339. The plague first infected people in a small, nearby settlement of traders eight years before it devastated Eurasia, killing 60 percent of the population, having traveled along trade routes. The lake&#x27;s status as a byway for travelers allowed the plague to spread across these continents via medieval merchants who unknowingly carried infested vermin along with them.
The lake level is some higher than in medieval times. Divers have found the remains of submerged settlements in shallow areas around the lake.

Articles identified as the world&#x27;s oldest extant coins were found underwater, with gold wire rings used as small change and a large hexahedral goldpiece. Also found was a bronze cauldron with a level of craftsmanship that is today achieved by using an inert gas environment.

In 1916 the monastery at Issyk-Kul was attacked by Kyrgyz rebels, and seven monks were killed.

==Environment==
===Specially protected areas===

The first nature reserve in Kyrgyzstan, Issyk-Kul State Reserve was established in 1948 to protect unique nature landscapes and waterfowl at Issyk-Kul. In 1975, it was acknowledged as a Ramsar site. Biosphere Reserve Issyk-Kul covered by UNESCO World Network of Biosphere Reserves was established in year 2000 within the administrative borders of Issyk-Kul Region.

===Fish===
The lake contains highly endemic fish biodiversity, and some of the species, including four endemics, are seriously endangered. In recent years yields of all fish species have declined markedly, due to a combination of overfishing, heavy predation by two of the introduced invasive species (the pike perch and the rainbow trout), and the cessation of lake restocking with juvenile fish from hatcheries. At least four commercially targeted endemic fish species are sufficiently threatened to be included in the Red Book of the Kyrgyz Republic — Schmidt&#x27;s dace (&quot;Leuciscus schmidti&quot;), Issyk-Kul dace (&quot;Leuciscus bergi&quot;), Ili marinka (&quot;Schizothorax pseudoaksaiensis issykkulensis&quot;), and sheer or naked osman (&quot;Gymnodiptychus dybowskii&quot;). Five other indigenous species — Issyk-kul minnow (&quot;Phoxinus issykkulensis&quot;), Issykul gudgeon (&quot;Gobio gobio latus&quot;), spotted thicklip loach (&quot;Triplophysa strauchii ulachilicus&quot;), grey stone loach (&quot;Triplophysa dorsalis&quot;), asp (&quot;Leuciscus aspius iblioides&quot;) — are almost certainly threatened as bycatch or are indirectly impacted by fishing activity and changes to the ecological structure and balance of the lake&#x27;s fish population.

Sevan trout, a fish endemic to Lake Sevan in Armenia, was introduced into Issyk-Kul in the 1970s. While this fish is an endangered species in its native waters, it has a much better chance to survive in Lake Issyk-Kul where it has actively predated on other species, but is limited in habitat for reproduction and in food.

===Birds===
The lake supports large numbers of wintering waterfowl as well as waders and passerines on passage migration. Both the western and eastern ends of the lake have been recognised as Important Bird Areas (IBAs) by BirdLife International.

===Dead Lake===
There is a small lake below the water level of Issyk Kul at the south-west side of the lake. This lake is called Tyz köl (salt lake) in Kyrgyz due to its very high saline content and swimming in the Issyk Kul salt lake is a very different experience from less salty water. The lake receives its water from small cold springs at the beach which lead the cold, less heavy water to the top of the lake and often the salty, heavy water below is oddly more warm than the water on the surface.

==Russian Navy test site==
During the Soviet period, the Soviet Navy operated an extensive facility at the lake&#x27;s east end, where submarine and torpedo technology was evaluated. In March 2008, Kyrgyz newspapers reported that around the Karabulan Peninsula on the lake would be leased for an indefinite period to the Russian Navy, which is planning to establish new naval testing facilities as part of the 2007 bilateral Agreement on Friendship, Cooperation, Mutual Help, and Protection of Secret Materials. The Russian military will pay $4.5 million annually to lease the area. India also plans to invest in the facility to test all types of torpedoes such as heavy weight torpedoes and those that have thermal navigation system. Another advantage that works for the testing center is that the torpedoes fired can also be recovered allowing scientists to make physical verification of a torpedo structure for further study. India is also planning to use the torpedo test facility to test the autonomous underwater vehicle being developed by NSTL. For this, India has proposed to engage local companies with know-how in torpedo technology to further co-develop the facility.

<text>The Tommyknockers is a 1987 science fiction novel by Stephen King. While maintaining a horror style, the novel is an excursion into the realm of science fiction for King, as the residents of the Maine town of Haven gradually fall under the influence of a mysterious object buried in the woods. King has since soured on &quot;The Tommyknockers&quot;, describing it as &quot;an awful book&quot;, due to his drug addiction while writing the novel, though acknowledges the story&#x27;s potential: &quot;There&#x27;s really a good book in here, underneath all the sort of spurious energy that cocaine provides, and I ought to go back.&quot; A miniseries adaptation of the same name was released in 1993.

==Plot==
While walking in the woods near the small town of Haven, Maine, Roberta &quot;Bobbi&quot; Anderson, a writer of Wild West-themed fiction, stumbles upon a metal object that turns out to be a protrusion of a long-buried alien spacecraft. Once exposed, the spacecraft begins to release an invisible gas into the atmosphere that gradually transforms people into beings similar to the aliens who populated the ship. The transformation, or &quot;becoming&quot;, provides them with a limited form of genius which makes them very inventive but does not provide any philosophical or ethical insight into their inventions, and they often do not understand the principles of the inventions (one of them admits, &quot;We&#x27;re builders, not understanders&quot;). The spacecraft also prevents those affected by it from leaving town, provokes psychotic violence in some people, and causes the disappearance of a young boy, David Brown, whose older brother Hilly teleports him to the planet referred to as Altair 4 by the Havenites (a reference to &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;).

The book&#x27;s central character is James Eric Gardener, a poet and friend of Bobbi, who goes by the nickname &quot;Gard&quot;. He is somewhat immune to the ship&#x27;s effects because of the steel plate in his head, a souvenir of a teenage skiing accident. Gard is also an alcoholic and is prone to binges that result in violent outbursts followed by lengthy blackouts.

As Bobbi is almost totally overcome by the euphoria of &quot;becoming&quot; one with the spacecraft, Gard increasingly sees her health worsen and her sanity disappear. Gard feels he has little to live for aside from his friendship with Bobbi and decides to stay with her to try to halt her decline. He witnesses the transformation of the townspeople, discovers the torture and mutilation of Bobbi&#x27;s dog Peter, and people being killed or worse when they pry too deeply into the strange events.

Over the course of several weeks, Gard, Bobbi, and others continue to unearth the ship. Bobbi and Gard eventually enter the ship; as they explore the ship, Gard realizes that the ship crashed because the crew was fighting with each other, and that the Tommyknockers have no moral limits to keep them from using living beings as organic batteries. As they leave the ship and return to Bobbi&#x27;s home, Gard plans to kill Bobbi as he can see she is no longer human. Using a gun, Bobbi forces Gard to swallow a lethal dose of Valium. As they talk, he shields his mind, pulls his own gun out, and shoots Bobbi. As Bobbi dies, she telepathically screams and alerts the townspeople, who then swarm to her home, intent on killing Gard for fear that he intends to harm the ship. Ev Hillman, David and Hilly&#x27;s grandfather, helps Gard escape into the woods in exchange for saving David Brown from Altair 4.

Gard enters the ship, near death after his struggle with the townspeople. With his last ounce of strength, he activates the ship and telepathically launches it into space. This results in the eventual deaths of nearly all of the changed townspeople, but prevents the possibly disastrous consequences of the ship&#x27;s influence spreading to the outside world. Very shortly afterward, agents from the FBI, CIA, and &quot;The Shop&quot; invade Haven and take as many of the Havenites as possible (killing nearly a quarter of the survivors), along with a few of the devices created by the altered people of Haven. In the last pages, David Brown is discovered safe in Hilly Brown&#x27;s hospital room.

==Influences==
In his autobiography &quot;On Writing&quot;, King attributes the basic premise to the short story &quot;The Colour Out of Space&quot; by H. P. Lovecraft. He also used a poem from his childhood for the book&#x27;s preamble:

The writer and critic Kim Newman said of the novel that King had &quot;more or less rewritten &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot;&quot;, a television serial from the late 1950s in which an alien spacecraft excavated in London evokes latent psychic abilities in some of the people who come near it. King wrote &quot;The Tommyknockers&quot; at a time when substance abuse was a significant part of his life. Metaphors for the stranglehold of addiction can be found throughout the book. In a 2014 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, King acknowledged that the quality of his writing suffered during his period of drug use, saying &quot;&quot;The Tommyknockers&quot; is an awful book. That was the last one I wrote before I cleaned up my act&quot;, adding he believes it could be a good book if it was rewritten to about half its original length.

Other themes in the book include the dangers of unchecked technological advancement and the corrupting influence of power. Bobbi uses the threat of stupid people in charge (&quot;the Dallas Police&quot;, referring to how poorly the Dallas police handled the JFK assassination) to get Gardener to help her until Gardener realizes that also applied to the Tommyknockers themselves. Gardener obsesses over the subject of &quot;the nukes&quot;, the reckless use of atomic power and the dangerous mishandling of nuclear material. The physical transformation of the townspeople resembles the toxic effects of ionizing radiation.

==Adaptations==
A two-part television miniseries based on the novel was shown in 1993 on ABC, starring Jimmy Smits as Jim Gardner and Marg Helgenberger as Bobbi Anderson. King has stated that he &quot;didn&#x27;t like it&quot;, commenting that &quot;it felt kind of cheap and thrown together&quot;. NBC announced in July 2013 that they would be producing a new miniseries based on &quot;The Tommyknockers&quot;. &quot;THR&quot; reported on March 29, 2018, that &quot;The Conjuring&quot; filmmaker James Wan and the 2017 &quot;It&quot; producer Roy Lee will join up with producer Larry Sanitsky to create a feature film version of &quot;The Tommyknockers&quot;.

<doc id="231761" wikidata="Q2900370" url="?curid=231761" title="Bevanism">
<text>Bevanism was a movement on the left wing of the Labour Party in the late 1950s led by Aneurin Bevan which also included Richard Crossman, Michael Foot and Barbara Castle. Bevanism was opposed by the Gaitskellites, moderate social democrats within the party. The Gaitskellites typically won most of the battles inside Parliament, but Bevanism was stronger among local Labour activists. The Bevanites split over the issue of nuclear weapons, and the movement faded away after Bevan died in 1960.

== History ==
Bevanism was influenced by Marxism; Bevan&#x27;s biographer and later Leader of the Labour Party Michael Foot said that Bevan&#x27;s &quot;belief in the class conflict stayed unshaken&quot;, while acknowledging that Bevan was not a traditional Marxist. Despite declaring inspiration from Karl Marx, Bevan did not visibly support insurrectionist concepts of proletarian revolution, arguing that revolution depended on the circumstances, or the typical organisational model of many Communist parties. According to Ed Balls, Bevan and his supporters instead preferred a strident but pluralist conception of democratic socialism, tempered by pragmatic sensibilities and practical application.

The Bevanite Group of MPs, of which there were about three dozen, coalesced following Bevan&#x27;s resignation from the Cabinet in 1951 when the health service started charging for previously free services such as spectacles in order to help pay for Britain&#x27;s involvement in the Korean War. Bevanites Harold Wilson and John Freeman resigned with Bevan himself. The group in Parliament drew heavily from the previous &quot;Keep Left&quot; group, which had previously dissented from the pro-American foreign policy of the 1945–1951 Labour government favoured by Clement Attlee, his Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin and Hugh Gaitskell. According to Crossman in December 1951 the group was not organised, and Bevan could not be persuaded to have any consistent or coherent strategy, but they did have a group who met regularly and liked each other and came to represent &quot;real Socialism&quot; to a large number of Party members. &quot;Picture Post&quot; called them the &quot;Bevanly Host&quot; in April 1952.

== Local organisations ==
Bevanites organised in Constituency Labour Parties across Britain, and set up local discussion groups known as &quot;Brains Trusts&quot;, also a legacy of the &quot;Keep Left&quot; group.

Brains Trusts organised in support of the newspaper favoured by Bevanites, &quot;Tribune&quot; magazine, allocating left-wing MPs and campaigners to form speaking panels around the country. &quot;Tribune&quot; itself provided an important print voice for Bevanite politicians and was in wide circulation.

== Objectives ==
The main Bevanite objectives were:

*State ownership of the &quot;commanding heights of the economy&quot;. Many nationalisations had made up the bedrock of Labour&#x27;s previous manifestos, such as &quot;Let us face the future&quot;. Bevanites&#x27; views towards nationalisation mirrored those of Vladimir Lenin, in that state control was only seen as necessary in the context of exchange or distribution, as opposed to the total and immediate appropriation of as much private property as possible.
* A comprehensive and completely free &#x27;cradle to grave&#x27; system of welfare, health provision and education.
* Housing for all.
* Full employment.
*The nationalisation of the steel industry, contrary to the views of many colleagues.
* Contempt for dogma as a modus operandi; an open-minded approach to democratic socialism.
* Respect for the arts.
* General unwillingness to yield upon the perceived gains made since 1945, for example, opposition to means testing for social security benefits, and opposition to prescription charges as military spending increased.
* A complementary ability to drop unpopular policies.
* Freedom of debate, opinion and criticism within the Labour Party.
* Scepticism towards most American foreign policy, especially the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and West German rearmament.
* Greater industrial democracy and workers&#x27; control of nationalized industries, which Bevan believed were governed unconstitutionally due to their lack of public accountability.

== Party role ==
Historian Kenneth O. Morgan says. &quot;Bevan alone kept the flag of left-wing socialism aloft throughout – which gave him a matchless authority amongst the constituency parties and in party conference.&quot; At the 1952 Labour Party Conference, Bevanites were elected to six of the seven places on the National Executive Committee by constituency representatives.

== Split over nuclear disarmament ==
Later in his political career, Bevan began advocating the maintenance of Britain&#x27;s nuclear deterrent, against those who became associated with the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), saying that without them a future British foreign secretary would be going &quot;naked into the conference chamber.&quot; This split the Bevanites; many, such as leading Bevanite Michael Foot, continued to oppose Britain&#x27;s nuclear weapons, with Labour&#x27;s 1983 manifesto under Foot&#x27;s leadership of the party calling for unilateral nuclear disarmament.

The lands of Mey belonged to the Bishops of Caithness. The Castle of Mey was built between 1566 and 1572, possibly on the site of an earlier fortification, by George Sinclair, 4th Earl of Caithness. According to a February 2019 report: &quot;The castle was probably built between 1566 and 1572 by George Sinclair, 4th Earl of Caithness [and] includes a dominating tower with a series of tall ranges to the side and rear creating a three-sided courtyard open to the north and the sea.&quot;Originally a Z-plan tower house of three storeys, it had a projecting wing at the south-east, and a square tower at the north-west. The castle passed to Lord Caithness&#x27;s younger son William, founder of the Sinclairs of Mey, although it later became the seat of the earls. The castle&#x27;s name was changed to Barrogill, and the structure was extended several times, in the 17th and 18th centuries, and again in 1821 when Tudor Gothic style alterations were made, to designs by William Burn. Barrogill passed out of the Sinclair family in 1889, on the death of George Sinclair, 15th Earl of Caithness, when it passed to F. G. Heathcote (later Sinclair). In 1929 it was bought by Captain Frederic Bouhier Imbert-Terry.

The castle was used as an officers&#x27; rest home during the Second World War, and in 1950 the estate farms were sold off. By that time, only the tower was habitable.

===Royal residence===

Barrogill Castle was in a semi-derelict state when, in 1952, the estate was bought by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, the widow of George VI, who had died earlier that year.

The Queen Mother set about restoring the castle for use as a holiday home, removing some of the 19th-century additions, and reinstated the castle&#x27;s original name. As part of the restoration, the castle was for the first time supplied with electricity and water.

Other work done in 1953–1954 included making the castle weathertight and habitable, as well as painting and plastering. The castle interior was also refurbished over the next few years. The west wing restoration was not completed until 1960.

The Queen Mother hung several portraits of the previous owners, the Earls of Caithness, around the castle. She regularly visited it in August and October from 1955 until her death in March 2002; the last visit was in October 2001.

In July 1996, the Queen Mother made the property, the and the farm over to the Queen Elizabeth Castle of Mey Trust, which has opened the castle and garden to the public regularly since her death. It is now open seven days a week from 1 May until 30 September each year, with a closed period of ten days at the end of July and the beginning of August, when King Charles III and Queen Camilla usually stay at Mey. The Trust opened a new Visitor Centre in early 2007, and the visitor numbers for that year topped 29,000.

===The Castle of Mey Trust===
The Castle of Mey Trust was established by a Deed of Trust executed on 11 June 1996. Its president was the then Prince of Wales. The Trust would manage the property; its mandate was &quot;to secure the future of the building, advance historical and architectural education, to develop the native breeds of Aberdeen Angus and Cheviot sheep and to undertake projects for the benefit of the local community&quot;, according to one report. After 2002, the Trust opened the castle for five months each summer to generate revenue that would sustain the property. In 2018, nearly 30,000 visits were recorded.

As of March 2014, the Trustees included former royal equerry Ashe Windham (chairman), Malcolm Sinclair, 20th Earl of Caithness, John Thurso, 3rd Viscount Thurso, and Sir Ian David Grant. There are also a number of Honorary Patrons associated with the trust: Lady Elizabeth Anson, Ken Bruce, Susan Hampshire, Kirsty King, Khalid bin Mahfouz, and Alan Titchmarsh (who is noted as being the first Honorary Patron). The trust together with the Friends and Patrons helped to maintain and promote the castle and all fundraising events.

Maintenance work completed by the Trust in 2018, including roof repairs, rewiring of the interior and lime harling of the exterior.

====New stewardship====
On 1 January 2019, stewardship of the Trust passed to The Prince&#x27;s Foundation. The president of the Foundation is Charles III. Since 1 January 2019, he has been not only the president of the Castle of Mey Trust but also its sole Trustee, through the Foundation. The Foundation stated its intention to retain the Trust&#x27;s goals: &quot;...the preservation of buildings and monuments; the promotion of historical and architectural education; the preservation of the Aberdeen Angus breed of cattle, and the championing of wider benefits to the community, while the Duke of Rothesay and The Prince&#x27;s Foundation is certain to make the continuation of his grandmother’s legacy a priority.&quot;

====The Granary Lodge bed and breakfast====
In early May 2019, the Prince of Wales (now Charles III) formally opened a new building, Granary Lodge, as a 10-bedroom bed and breakfast on the castle grounds. This building combined the previous stables and granary. During the planning stages, it was decided to have &quot;eco-heating&quot; and to use local materials and craftsmen where possible.

Granary Lodge is one of the first ventures under the stewardship of The Prince&#x27;s Foundation. The business is owned and operated by the Trust and planned to accept guests starting on 15 May 2019. Profits will go to maintaining and operating the estate as a tourist destination.

====Public use====
In January 2023, it was reported that the castle tearoom would be open to the public every Tuesday until March as a warming centre, an initiative by the Prince&#x27;s Foundation.

==In popular culture==
The ruins of Barrogill Castle are the scene of a black mass in the Nick Carter-Killmaster series novel &quot;Spy Castle&quot; (1966).

The Queen Mother&#x27;s purchase of the castle is featured in the Netflix show &quot;The Crown&quot; (episode 8 of the first season, &quot;Pride &amp; Joy&quot;).

<doc id="231775" wikidata="Q4751681" url="?curid=231775" title="Anarchy in Action">
<text>Anarchy in Action by Colin Ward explores anarchist thought and practice. It was initially published by Allen %26 Unwin in 1973, and was subsequently published in America and, in translation, in Dutch, Italian, Spanish and Japanese A second edition was published by Freedom Press in 2008. He explained, in its &quot;Introduction&quot;, that his book &#x27;is simply an extended, updating footnote to Kropotkin&#x27;s &quot;Mutual Aid&quot;.&#x27; 

The book is a introduction to anarchism but differs considerably from other introductions by concentrating on the possibility of an anarchism rooted in everyday experience that is not necessarily linked to industrial and political struggles. 

Ward based his book on evidence from sociology, anthropology, cybernetics, industrial psychology, and from the experience of housing, town planning, education, work, play and social welfare. Ward argued for anarchist alternatives to the universal governmental and hierarchical systems of social organisation, including the welfare state.

== Quotation ==
&quot;The argument of this book is that an anarchist society, a society which organizes itself without authority, is always in existence, like a seed beneath the snow, buried under the weight of the state and its bureaucracy, capitalism and its waste, privilege and its injustices, nationalism and its suicidal loyalties, religious differences and their superstitious separatism.&quot;

<text>The Aerobee rocket was one of the United States&#x27; most produced and productive sounding rockets. Developed by the Aerojet Corporation, the Aerobee was designed to combine the altitude and launching capability of the V-2 with the cost effectiveness and mass production of the WAC Corporal. More than 1000 Aerobees were launched between 1947 and 1985, returning vast amounts of astronomical, physical, aeronomical, and biomedical data.

==Development==

Research using V-2 rockets after World War II produced valuable results concerning the nature of cosmic rays, the solar spectrum, and the distribution of atmospheric ozone. However, the limited supply and the expense of assembling and firing the V-2 rockets, as well as the small payload capacity of the first purpose-built sounding rocket, the WAC Corporal, created demand for a low cost sounding rocket to be used for scientific research. An Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) effort led by James Van Allen led to a contract presented 17 May 1946 by the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) to Aerojet, at the time a producer of WAC Corporal rockets, for the procurement of 20 liquid-fueled sounding rockets capable of carrying a payload to an altitude of . 15 of the new rockets would be allocated to APL, and 5 to NRL. Aerojet was to be the prime contractor while Douglas Aircraft, also a producer of WAC Corporals, would provide aerodynamic engineering and take on some of the production.

The Aerojet designation for the new rocket was &quot;Aerobee&quot;, a contraction of Aerojet, manufacturer of the engine, and Bumblebee, a Navy guided missile program. It was a single-stage, liquid-fueled, fin-stabilized rocket, using a solid-propellant rocket motor as a booster. This booster was jettisoned after 2.5 seconds of operation. The nose cone containing the telemetry transmitter and the scientific payload was recoverable and returned to earth on a parachute. As with its progenitor, the WAC Corporal, the Aerobee required a tall launch tower to provide the necessary stability until the relatively slowly accelerating rocket gained enough speed for its fins to be effective in controlling attitude. Launch towers were adjustable in inclination and azimuth to compensate for wind.

On 25 September 1947, a dummy Aerobee attached to a live booster engine was launched from White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico for flight testing. This was followed (after two more dummy tests in October) by the first complete Aerobee launch on 24 November. The flight was terminated after 35 seconds when the rocket&#x27;s tail began yawing back and forth. This Aerobee was the first rocket fired by the US Navy at White Sands and the subject of the first comprehensive missile range safety program.

The next Aerobee launch, on 5 March 1948, was a complete success, achieving an altitude of and breaching the boundary of space (as defined by the World Air Sports Federation).

==Operational history==
===Early launches===
The original Aerobee design was designated RTV-N-8 by the Navy and XASR-1 by Aerojet and the Army. This rocket was powered by the XASR-1, a version of the 21AL-2600 engine also used in the Nike Ajax.

The XASR-1 engine was superseded by the XASR-2, which used helium for fuel tank pressurization instead of compressed air. First flying in late 1949, Aerobees using the new engine were designated RTV-N-10(a) by the Navy and RTV-A-1 by the Air Force. Variants on this design employed by the Air Force included the RTV-A-1a, which used an Aerojet AJ10-25 sustainer with of thrust, but with a shorter duration; the RTV-A-1c, identical but without a solid rocket booster; the RTV-A-1b, using the XASR-1 engine, but with chemical pressurization; and the RTV-A-1d, using the engine of the −1a, with chemical pressurization, and launched without booster.

The Navy also evolved their XASR-2 Aerobees. The RTV-N-10b used a variant of the −10a&#x27;s engine with a higher specific impulse; the RTV-N-10c was a production variant of the −10b. The USAF fielded a production version of the RTV-N-10b, which did not get an official designation.

On 2 December 1949, the Air Force launched its first Aerobee from Holloman AFB Launch Complex A. Though the rocket flew to nearly in altitude and took the first color motion-pictures of the Earth from space, the payload was lost and not recovered until 13 July 1950, by which point the film (as well as x-ray emulsions that has also been carried aboard) were unsalvageable. This inauspicious beginning was followed by 32 more Aerobee flights, most of which were successful, including the first successful flight of a monkey, on 18 April 1951.

By the early 1950s Aerobee was the sounding rocket of choice being flown by the Navy Research Laboratory, USAF, and Army Signal Corps. The cost of lofting a pound of scientific payload to altitude was significantly lower than that of any competitor. In 1955, the USAF&#x27;s RTV-A-1 rockets were redesignated X-8 (X-8a-d corresponding with the old RTV-A-1a-d series).

===Later versions===
The first major derivative version, the Aerobee-Hi (first launched in 1955) featured an increase in length, fuel capacity and improved engineering design. There were two versions of the Aerobee-Hi. The Air Force Aerobee Hi, (MX-1960, XRM-84) and the slightly longer Navy Aerobee-Hi (RV-N-13, PWN-2A). Engine development continued with the AJ11-6, AJ11-18, AJ11-20, AJ11-21, and AGVL0113C/F/H/I of the Aerobee-Hi. The Aerobe-Hi was boosted by the 2.5KS-18000 booster. The Navy Aerobee-Hi was considerably different from the Air Force Aerobee-Hi, using the fuel pressure regulator from the Nike Ajax, a delayed start function and a pressure sealed tail cone to allow better measurement of the external upper atmosphere.

Following the creation of NASA, development of Aerobees became largely guided by NASA. Exceptions developed for the armed services included the Aerobee 170, aka Nike-Aerobee, which combined the Nike M5E1 booster with the Aerobee 150, and the Aerobee 300 which used a AIM-7 Sparrow missile motor in its second stage; the Aerobee 300 was also known as the Sparrowbee. There were versions of Aerobee-Hi such as the Aerobee 150 and 150A in which case the difference was in the number of fins, the 150 having three and the 150A four. The Aerobee 100 was essentially a shortened Aerobee 150 with an AJ11 engine. By far the largest of the Aerobee series was the Aerobee 350, composed of four clustered Aerobee 150s boosted by a Nike M5E1. Though they bore the Aerobee appellation, the Aerobee 75 and proposed Aerobee 90 were not actually related to the others in that they were solid propellant rockets with the 75 having a HAWK motor, the 90 was a 75 with a Sparrow second stage.

Over the decades of development Aerobees were flown with many related engines including the XASR-1 (21AL-2600), 45AL-2600, AJ10-24, AJ10-25, AJ10-27, AJ10-34, AJ11-6, and AJ60-92. Later versions of the AJ10 and AJ-11 engines produced of thrust. Boosters included surplus Nike M5E1 boosters and VKM-17 and VKM-20s as we&#x27;ll as the original 2.5KS-18000.

Launch towers for Aerobee rockets were built at the White Sands Missile Range and Holloman AFB in New Mexico; Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia; Eglin AFB in Florida; Churchill Rocket Research Range in Manitoba, Canada; and Woomera, South Australia. Aerobees were also launched from Centro de Lancamento da Barreira do Inferno (CLBI), Natal, Rio Grande N, Brazil; Kauai Test Facility, Barking Sands, Kauai; Nouadhibou, Dakhlet Nouadhibou, Mauritania; Vandenberg AFB, California; Walker&#x27;s Cay, Bahamas; and aboard the research vessel USS &quot;Norton Sound&quot;. Two Seabee missiles were launched from the sea off Point Mugu, California. The Seabee&#x27;s (Sea launched Aerobees) were launched from a position floating in water as part of Robert Truax&#x27;s Sea Dragon project for Aerojet. The Aerobees launched from overseas locations such as the Bahamas used a modified launch tower that had originally been used on the USS &quot;Norton Sound&quot;. NASA further modified that tower into the Mobile Aerobee Launch Facility (MALF) which was first used in 1966 for launches from Natal, Brazil.

A total of 1,037 Aerobees (including variants) were launched from all locations with a success rate in excess of 97%. More than half of these were Aerobee 150/150As. The last Aerobee, a 150 MI, flew an Airglow payload at White Sands on 17 January 1985.

===Australian launches===
The &quot;Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the United States of America regarding the Launching of Three Aerobee Rockets&quot; was established in Canberra, March 1970. A similar treaty was agreed to in 1973 for seven launches, and in 1977 for six launches for various astronomical and solar experiments conducted by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.

In 1974, the US DARPA through Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratory and Australia agreed to launch three rockets under project &quot;Hi Star South&quot;.

A total of 20 Aerobee launches were made at Woomera Test Range:
* Series 150: 3 launches in May/June 1970
* Series 170: 7 launches in November 1973 and 2 launches February 1977
* Series 200: 3 launches in September 1974
* Series 200A: 5 launches in February 1977

==Accomplishments==

===Science===

The scientific research done with the Aerobee family included photography, biomedical research, biology, the study of energetic particles, ionospheric physics, meteorology, radio astronomy, solar physics, aeronomy, spectrometry, signals intelligence research, infrared studies, magnetometry, ultraviolet and X-ray astronomy, as well as many other fields such as aerodynamic research and missile technology development. Aerobees were a vital part of America&#x27;s efforts in the International Geophysical Year, comprising more than half of the allocated IGY sounding rocket budget.

The earliest space biomedical missions were launched via Aerobee: Three Air Force missions carrying mice and monkeys, launched 1951–52, determined that the brief (~15 minutes) exposure to acceleration, reduced gravity, and high altitude cosmic radiation did not have significant negative effects.

An Aerobee 150 launched on 19 June 1962 (UTC) detected the first X-rays emitted from a source outside our solar system (Scorpius X-1).

===First payload to interplanetary space===

On 16 October 1957, Aerobee USAF-88 was launched from Holloman LC-A in New Mexico to hurl the first artificial objects into interplanetary space. Several varieties of aluminum cones packed with explosive charges were mounted in the rocket&#x27;s nose cone. 91 seconds after liftoff, at an altitude of , the charges were fired. A bright green flash ensued, observable from Palomar Observatory away. Post-launch analysis suggested that at least two fragments from the exploding charges had soared away from the Earth with twice the kinetic energy necessary to reach escape velocity and become the first artificial satellites of the Sun. When the achievement was announced the following month, it was compared favorably in the contemporary press to the Soviet launch of the first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, just 12 days before the Aerobee launch. However, subsequent analysis by space historian Jonathan McDowell suggests that none of the payload fragments actually achieved escape velocity.

==Legacy==
An artifact of the Aerobee programs, which remains in use today, is the large enclosed launch tower built for the Aerobee 350 at White Sands Launch Complex 36.

==Technical data==

An additional 36 Aerobees of unknown type were launched by the Army, Navy and Air Force between 1957 and 1959:

<doc id="231787" wikidata="Q947905" url="?curid=231787" title="Public holidays in Finland">
<text>All official holidays in Finland are established by acts of Parliament. The official holidays can be divided into Christian and non-Christian holidays. The main Christian holidays are Christmas, New Year&#x27;s Day, Epiphany, Easter, Ascension day, Pentecost, Midsummer Day, and All Saints&#x27; Day. The non-Christian holidays are May Day and the Independence Day of Finland.

In addition to this all Sundays are official holidays but they are not as important as the special holidays. The names of the Sundays follow the liturgical calendar and they can be categorized as Christian holidays. When, in the late 1960s, the standard working week in Finland was reduced to 40 hours by an act of Parliament, it also meant that all Saturdays became a sort of &quot;de facto&quot; public holidays, though not &quot;official&quot; ones. Easter Sunday and Pentecost are Sundays that form part of a &quot;main&quot; holiday and they are preceded by a kind of &quot;special&quot; Saturdays.

Several Christian holidays traditionally falling on working days or on fixed dates have been moved to Saturdays and Sundays. In 1955, Midsummer day was moved to the Saturday following 19 June, the feast of the Annunciation to the Sunday following 21 March (or, if this coincides with Easter or with Palm Sunday, the Sunday before Palm Sunday), and All Saints&#x27; Day to the Saturday following 30 October. More holidays were moved in 1973: Epiphany to the Saturday following 5 January and Ascension Day to the Saturday before the traditional Thursday, but these revisions were reversed in 1991.

== Tradition ==
Christmas Eve and Midsummer Eve might very well be the single most important holidays during the entire year for Finns. Surprisingly they are not officially called holidays and are not so marked in calendars, but for most people, are not working days, and in practice they differ from official holidays only in that most shops are open on those days from early morning till noon. They hold this &quot;de facto&quot; status partly due to some statements in legislation but also because most employment contracts provides for these days as full holidays. A number of the less important main holidays are also preceded by &quot;de facto&quot; half days, meaning that in some (but not all) offices working hours are then shorter than normally. These are Maundy Thursday, the day before May Day and New Year&#x27;s Eve.

Already before the 5 days working week was generally adopted in Finland in the late 1960s, working hours in most cases were shorter on Saturdays (4...5 h) than on other weekdays (8 h), but they were equally shorter also on all eves of public holidays, for example on the eve of Epiphany, the eve of All Saints&#x27; Day, and even including Christmas Eve and Midsummer Eve. But when Saturdays ceased to be working days, new contracts removed these shortenings from other holiday eves, except from Midsummer and Christmas Eve which also became &quot;de facto&quot; holidays.

The Finnish calendar also provides for special flag flying days. A day&#x27;s status as a flag flying day has no formal link with an eventual status as an official or as a &quot;de facto&quot; holiday. However, May Day, Midsummer Day and Independence Day have the status of both a flag flying day and a public holiday. Midsummer Day is also Flag Day.

Finland has an official National Day, 6 December. Some minor observances are also denoted in the Finnish calendar, though they have not been judged worthy of either holiday or flag flying day status.

<doc id="231789" wikidata="Q738695" url="?curid=231789" title="Prime Minister of Finland">
<text>The prime minister of Finland (; ) is the leader of the Finnish Government. The prime minister and their cabinet exercise executive authority in the state. The prime minister is formally ranked third in the protocol after the president of Finland and the speaker of the Parliament but is in practice the most powerful officeholder. Finland&#x27;s first prime minister, Pehr Evind Svinhufvud (also later the 3rd president of Finland), was appointed on 27 November 1917, just a few days before the country declared its independence. 

The incumbent prime minister is Petteri Orpo of the National Coalition Party. Orpo was sworn in on 20 June 2023.

==History==
In 1918, the Senate of Finland was transformed into the Government of Finland, and the position of vice-chairman of the Economic Division was transformed into that of the prime minister. Kesäranta, located in the westerly Meilahti subdivision of Helsinki, has been the official residence of the prime minister of Finland since 1919.

Since its independence in 1917, Finland has had 72 cabinets. The longest lasting have been the two cabinets of prime minister Paavo Lipponen (Lipponen I and Lipponen II), both lasting the entire parliamentary term, or 1,464 days.

==Appointment==
The prime minister&#x27;s appointment follows the parliamentary election, which are scheduled to be held once every four years.

Under the provisions of the Constitution of Finland, the president nominates a prime minister after the parties in the parliament have negotiated the distribution of seats in the new cabinet and the government&#x27;s programme. The parliament must ratify the nominated prime minister with an absolute majority in a confidence vote without other candidates. If the nominee doesn&#x27;t receive sufficient support, a new round of negotiations and a second nomination by the President follows. If the second nominee also fails to gain an absolute majority, a third vote is held, in which any member of parliament can nominate a candidate; in this round a plurality is sufficient for election. 

The above procedure was first used to elect Anneli Jäätteenmäki to the premiership in 2003. Previously it was assumed that the president would nominate the candidate who, in a third round of voting, would have gained a relative majority, this usually being the leader of the party with the largest seat share in parliament. Before the 2000 constitution was enacted, full formal powers to appoint the prime minister and the rest of the government had been the privilege of the president, who was free to diverge from parliamentary principles, although the ministers appointed had to have the confidence of the parliament.

Formally, the prime minister nominates the remaining members of the government, who are then, with the consent of Parliament, appointed by the president. In practice, the seats are divided between parties during the negotiations to form the government, so that the prime minister candidate must take into account the opinions of the participating parties and cannot nominate or remove whoever they wish.

==Salary and benefits==
The prime minister&#x27;s salary is €12,173 per month. In addition, the prime minister receives half of the parliamentary salary. The full parliamentary salary is, as of 1 May 2011, at least €6,335 a month, so the Finnish prime minister receives at least €14,842 per month in total. The salary is subject to income tax. 

The prime minister is entitled to 30 vacation days during each calendar year. The maintenance, staff and services of Kesäranta, the official residence, are paid for by the government. The prime minister&#x27;s benefits do not include free meals or meal allowance. 

The prime minister has transportation and security services at their disposal at all times.

<text>The Archpoet ( 1130 – c. 1165), or  (in Latin and German), is the name given to an anonymous 12th-century author of ten medieval Latin poems, the most famous being his &quot;Confession&quot; found in the manuscript (under CB 191). Along with Hugh Primas of Orléans (with whom he has sometimes been confused), he is cited as the best exemplar of Goliardic poetry and one of the stellar poets of the Latin Middle Ages.

Knowledge about him comes essentially from his poems found in manuscripts: his noble birth in an unspecified region of Western Europe, his respectable and classical education, his association with Archchancellor Rainald of Dassel&#x27;s court, and his poetic activity linked to it in both content and purpose. As such, it has been speculated that the , extravagant personality emanating from his work could be only serving as a despite its apparent autobiographical trend.

==Biography==
===Identity and nickname===
His existence has been elaborated upon the authorial superscription &quot;&quot; appearing with the poems now ascribed to him in a small number of manuscripts. While some recent—and so far inconclusive—attempts have been made to identify the Archpoet as either one of two Rodulfuses from the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa&#x27;s entourage, his real identity has never been found and is most likely lost for good.

It has been suggested by W. H. T. Jackson and others that his nickname could be a play on his patron Rainald of Dassel&#x27;s title of Archchancellor ( in Latin), even if its exact origins are ultimately left open to speculation. Moreover, it is not known how he came to earn the nickname or who bestowed it to him: whether as a mark of esteem from the audiences, other poets, Rainald himself; as a satirical jest on his patron&#x27;s title; or as an ironical mock self-attribution. There has been report of at least two other &quot;, itinerant clerics, bearing the &quot; pseudonym or title around that time: one Nicholas who briefly resided with the Cistercians at their abbey, and Henry of Avranches (around 1250); yet both are distinct from the &quot;&quot; of Barbarossa&#x27;s reigning period (1155–1190).

===Conjectured life===
The Archpoet&#x27;s living circumstances have been surmised from the indicative content of his poems but mostly from the life of Rainald of Dassel. Because he designates Rainald as Archbishop of Cologne, it shows that he must have been alive and active for at least some time between 1159 (when Rainald became archbishop) and 1167 (when he died); furthermore, all of his datable poems fall within 1162 and 1164. With the passing of his patron in 1167, no more is heard from the Archpoet. Also, in poem X, Peter Dronke writes, &quot;he counts himself among the : while technically a can be any age between twenty-one and fifty, it would seem plausible to imagine the Archpoet as thirty or thirty-five at the time of this composition, and to set his birth not too far from 1130.&quot;

Several indications concur as to establish that the Archpoet came from a place north of the Alps, although no solid claim can be made as to which country, even though Germany has repeatedly and traditionally being taken as his birthplace. He refers to himself as &quot;&quot;, of knightly birth, and, coming from such a high class, was most certainly well-educated in the liberal arts, theology and the classics. In poem IV, he states that he chose the pursuit of poetry (as symbolized by the Roman poet Virgil) over a career in the military (as symbolized by the Trojan warrior Paris) as his birth permitted and disposed him to. It has been deduced from the same poem that he first traveled to Salerno in order to pursue medical studies but that due to ill health, he had to abandon this project.

It was probably then that he began working—possibly as a &quot;&quot;, a &quot;master of the art of writing letters&quot;—at the court of Rainald of Dassel, the bishop elector of Cologne and Archchancellor to Frederick Barbarossa, Holy Roman Emperor, about which he wrote, according to Ernst Robert Curtius, &quot;[t]he most brilliant stanzas&quot; among the many written about and/or for him during the 35 years of his reign. His references to Salerno, Vienna, and Cologne in his poems, as well as several details gleaned from the Archchancellor&#x27;s court displacements, suggest that he did travel around northern Italy, Provence, Burgundy, Austria and Germany during his life. It is known that the Archpoet lived for some time—possibly the last years of his life—at the monastery of St. Martin in Cologne. As is the case with many medieval and/or anonymous authors, very little else can be said with certainty about his life.

===Modern critical reassessment===
While it is still commonly assumed that the Archpoet was a follower of the Goliard tradition—writing student drinking songs, parodies critical of the Church and satires on the life of itinerant clergy in the Middle Ages—, the noted scholar Peter Dronke proposed a very different portrait in his 1968 book &quot;The Medieval Lyric&quot;:

This view of the Archpoet and his milieu, severely contrasting with that of the previous generations of researchers and writers such as J. A. Symonds and Helen Waddell, created a break in modern High Middle Ages scholarship about the Goliards and, in spite of not creating consensus within the academic community, has since been embraced by many scholars. Summarizing Dronke&#x27;s view by using English writer Geoffrey Chaucer as an example of differentiation between actual (historical) self and poetic (fictional) persona, Jan Ziolkowski wrote that the Archpoet&#x27;s shenanigans &quot;may be little more than a stance struck by the poet to entertain his audience; the persona could be as far from the reality as that of Chaucer the character was from Chaucer the poet or man.&quot; Dronke further argued that the Archpoet could well have been Hugh Primas&#x27;s student in Orléans, getting acquainted through him with various rare Classical poets and also with his personal style (themes and techniques).

==Works==
===Overview===
The Archpoet is known to us today through ten Latin poems or (plural form of &quot;carmen&quot;, Latin equivalent of &quot;song&quot; or &quot;chant&quot;) found in various manuscripts dating back to the 12th and 13th centuries. Listed here are the poems, identified, as is customary, by their incipit:

* I: &quot;
* II: &quot;
* III: &quot;
* IV: &quot;
* V: &quot;

* VI: &quot;
* VII: &quot;
* VIII: &quot;
* IX: &quot;
* X: &quot; (&quot;Confession&quot;)
The works of the Archpoet have been found and preserved in the following manuscripts, among others:
* Univ. Bibl. Göttingen Codex philol. 170 (12th century): I-VII; first stanza of VIII.
* Brussels Bibliothèque Royale 2071 (13th century): IX and X; stanzas 1–5 of VII.
* Codex Buranus: München Bayer. Staatsbibl. Clm 4660/4660a (13th century): X; 4 stanzas of IV.

The thus contains the 25-stanza &quot;&quot; (X) under the reference number CB 191 as well as 4 stanzas from &quot;&quot; (IV) under CB 220, starting with &quot;&quot; in the collection.

===Presentation===
Despite being quite dissimilar from one another in terms of tone and intent, the ten poems are all &quot;occasional&quot; in the sense that they have been written for a specific purpose under precise circumstances, whether to celebrate an event or respond to a request; in the Archpoet&#x27;s case, concerning the court of his patron: eight of them are directed to Rainald of Dassel, while the two others are addressed to Frederick Barbarossa himself. For example, the fourth poem, &quot;&quot;, was most probably written as a plaintive answer to what he felt was the unreasonable demand from Rainald that he write within one week an epic recounting the Emperor&#x27;s campaign in Italy.

The Archpoet&#x27;s poems are known for appearing &quot;intensely personal&quot;: he features in almost all of them, and deals in an outspoken manner with intimate subjects such as his material (e.g. poverty, wandering) and spiritual (e.g. distress, anger, love) condition, his flawed and sinful nature, his wishes and aspirations. Many of his poems, whether panegyric or not, amount to very elaborate pleas to obtain food, drink, clothing, and money from his powerful patron. Yet far from falling into mere lyricism or honest confidence, they are often undermined by subtle sarcasm and disguised , fitting with the persona the Archpoet seems to have created for himself as a free-spirited, vagabond hedonist, unrepentant in his propensity to overindulge and unblushing in the judgment of his self-worth. Aside from their recognized technical merits, the poems are imbued with a strong and pervading sense of humor manifested in the consummate use and manipulation of classical and biblical sources for parodic, sarcastic and ironic purposes.
===&quot;Confession&quot;===
Described as &quot;the prototype of the goliardic songs&quot; as well as &quot;the masterpiece of the [Goliardic] school&quot;, the best known poem of the Archpoet is his tenth, &quot;&quot;, commonly called the Goliardic &quot;Confession&quot; (sometimes &quot;, &quot; or &quot;Confession of Golias&quot;), a metrical composition of ironical tone wherein he confesses his love of women, gambling, and drinking. It is purported to have been written in Pavia around the year 1163 for his patron as a confession and defense of his sins after a rival of the Archpoet witnessed and subsequently reported his reprobate behavior. For example, the oft-cited twelfth stanza goes:

The parodic and satirical effect is mainly produced by the replacement of (&quot;sinner&quot;) by (&quot;drunkard&quot;), a reference to the Scripture: &quot;&quot;(Luke 18:13) The poem relies heavily on ambiguity for its overall effect: on one hand, the narrator poses as a penitent dissolute, while on the other he is not being apologetic at all.

The &quot;Confession&quot; was very famous in the Archpoet&#x27;s time: compared to his other poems, which are mostly found in only one manuscript, &quot;&quot; has been copied in more than thirty, and it almost single-handedly accounts for his enduring appeal as the writer of one of the most popular medieval Latin poems.

==Interpretation and appraisal==
* In her influential study &quot;The Wandering Scholars of the Middle Ages&quot;, Helen Waddell laudingly writes of the poem, stating that &quot;Confessio Goliae&quot; is something more than the arch-type of a generation of vagabond scholars, or the greatest drinking song in the world: it is the first defiance by the artist of that society which it is his thankless business to amuse: the first cry from the House of the Potter, &quot;Why hast thou made me thus?&quot;.&quot;
* Reading the medieval &quot;Confession&quot; with the perspective of a modern cultural critic, philosopher Herbert Marcuse wrote of the Archpoet&#x27;s artistic posture and keen sense of his particular situation: &quot;Archipoeta is perhaps the first artist with the artist&#x27;s genuine awareness of himself, who comprehended and openly emphasized that his vagabond life and his opposition to the surrounding world were an artistic necessity... The splendid strophes of his vagabond&#x27;s confession resonate with the elevated consciousness of the authentic lifestyle of the freelance artist&quot;.

==In popular culture==
* A section of the &quot;Confession&quot; supplies the text for the aria (&quot;Burning with inner rage&quot;) that was set to music by Carl Orff in his 1935–1936 &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; cantata.
* John Myers Myers&#x27;s 1949 novel &quot;Silverlock&quot; features Golias, the mythical patron saint of the Goliardic , as one of the main characters, drawing heavily on the Archpoet&#x27;s &quot;Confession&quot; for his portrayal.
* An old commercium song titled &quot;&quot; () is composed from stanzas 12, 13, 15, 17, 19, and 18 of the &quot;Confession&quot;.
* The Archpoet is a character in Italian writer Umberto Eco&#x27;s 2000 novel &quot;Baudolino&quot;.
* &quot;Mystics, Spirit, Voices&quot;, the 2000 debut album of the German musical project Lesiëm, features a song titled &quot;&quot; () which contains a fragment of the &quot;Confession&quot;.
* The German darkwave band Helium Vola recorded versions of &quot;&quot; (II) on their 2001 studio album &quot;Helium Vola&quot; (track 7, ), and of &quot;&quot; (X) on their 2004 studio album &quot;Liod&quot; (track 10, ).

<text>Dennis Eric Danell 
(June 24, 1961 – February 29, 2000) was an American musician, guitarist and co-founding member of the Southern California punk rock band Social Distortion.

==Biography==
Danell joined Social Distortion in 1979 while he and frontman Mike Ness attended Troy High School (Fullerton, CA) together. Mike recruited him to play guitar despite not yet knowing how to play an instrument. Due to this, the other members, Casey Royer and Rikk Agnew left as they did not want to wait for him to learn. When Social Distortion recorded its first single in 1981, &quot;Mainline/Playpen&quot;, Danell was the bassist, choosing this because it was &quot;easier to play. I only had to hit single notes rather than forming chords&quot;. Shortly after the brief bass stint, Danell switched to guitar after Ness taught him how to play. His steady, melodic playing helped define the group&#x27;s signature jangle on such albums as &quot;Mommy&#x27;s Little Monster&quot; (1983), &quot;Prison Bound&quot; (1988), &quot;Social Distortion&quot; (1990), &quot;Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell&quot; (1992) and &quot;White Light, White Heat, White Trash&quot; (1996).

After Social Distortion went on hiatus following the release of &quot;Live at the Roxy&quot; in 1998, Danell produced numerous local bands at the group&#x27;s recording studio, Casbah, in Fullerton, California. His production credits included Fanmail (BEC Records), Value Pac (Four Door Entertainment), Fraidy Cats (Bulletproof Records), The Deluxtone Rockets (Tooth &amp; Nail Records), and Rock Star Barbecue, the debut artist on Danell&#x27;s new independent label, Masterpiece Records. By 2000, Danell was quickly becoming a much sought-after producer in the Orange County area.

Danell also started a new side band called Strung Gurus, with Michael Knott of the Orange County band, Aunt Betty&#x27;s (formerly on Elektra). Danell produced, co-wrote and played guitar for them, whilst working on their first full-length album. The Strung Gurus debut, to be the second release on Masterpiece Records, was nearly completed.

==Death==
Danell remained the guitarist for Social Distortion until his untimely death on Leap Day, 2000. Danell, aged 38, was at his Newport Beach, California home when he suddenly died in the driveway during a move to a new residence. The band&#x27;s longtime manager reported that Danell died of cerebral aneurysm. According to other sources, the Orange County Coroner&#x27;s Office lists his death as &quot;Idiopathic Dilated Cardiomyopathy.&quot; Mike Ness stated on the DVD commentary of &quot;Another State of Mind&quot; that Dennis died from a heart condition.

In May 2000, several stalwart Southern California punk bands performed a benefit concert for Danell&#x27;s family at the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre. The Offspring, X, TSOL, and Pennywise appeared, and Social Distortion performed with new member Johnny 2 Bags from Cadillac Tramps stepping in for Dennis.

He later joined Danzig in 1987, playing on the band&#x27;s first four albums as well as their first EP before leaving in 1994. Most recently, he played in Social Distortion from 1996 to 1999.

==Career==

===Musical Influence===
Biscuits has named his main influences as John Bonham, Rat Scabies of the Damned, Topper Headon of the Clash, Keith Moon and Stewart Copeland.

===Black Flag &amp; Circle Jerks Era===
Biscuits is the brother of Ken &quot;Dimwit&quot; Montgomery, a fixture on the Vancouver music scene—at different times, both brothers played drums for D.O.A. Biscuits joined Black Flag in 1982 and toured with them for five months. His only studio recordings for the band were the 1982 demos for the &quot;My War&quot; album, which have been widely bootlegged.

However, Biscuits and Henry Rollins had clashing personalities, and problems with their record label nudged the drummer to jump ship and join original Black Flag singer Keith Morris’s influential band, the Circle Jerks. Biscuits played with the Circle Jerks relatively briefly until he joined Floorlords. Biscuits planned to quit the music business and took art and electrical engineering courses when that band broke up. He briefly filled in on drums for a few shows for the Red Hot Chili Peppers during their &quot;Freaky Styley tour&quot; in 1986.

===Danzig Era===
In 1987, producer Rick Rubin invited Biscuits to become the drummer for Danzig. Biscuits had been vocalist/songwriter Glenn Danzig&#x27;s first choice as drummer for his band.

Biscuits joined Danzig in 1987 and appeared on the band&#x27;s first four albums and one EP. In 1990 he recorded drums for one track on Glenn Danzig&#x27;s final album with the band Samhain. In 1994 he became the first member of the original Danzig line-up to leave the band, citing a contract dispute as the reason for his departure.

===Social Distortion===
Biscuits left Danzig in 1994 over royalty disagreements. He was replaced by a pre–Queens Of The Stone Age Joey Castillo, after Dave Grohl turned down an offer to join. Biscuits tried to rejoin the group but were rejected and forced to find another group to play with.
In 1996 Biscuits hooked up with another big act from the punk scene, joining Social Distortion between the recording and release of the band’s White Light, White Heat, White Trash album. Biscuits is credited on the album’s liner notes, although Deen Castronovo’s playing was featured on the record. 
Biscuits participated in a special concert held on December 28, 1994, to honor the lifetime achievements of his brother Ken, who had died earlier in the year of a drug overdose.

===Death Hoax===
On October 27, 2009, a blogger named James Greene Jr. who claimed to have been in recent contact with Biscuits posted a report on his blog announcing that the drummer had died on October 24 of throat cancer. This report quickly circulated to multiple media sources, but was soon questioned by Biscuits&#x27; friends and family as a hoax. That evening, Biscuit&#x27;s sister-in-law e-mailed Greene to confirm that the musician was still alive. Biscuits himself never released a statement concerning the death hoax, and Greene would later argue that Biscuits was entirely responsible for the false report.

==Equipment==
Biscuits used Pro-Mark DC-10 marching sticks to drum. His drumkit at the beginning of Danzig was a black Premier Resonator, though he switched to a chrome covered 1970s era Ludwig Classic maple kit for &quot;Danzig II&quot;, and continued with that kit to record and tour for &quot;Danzig III&quot; and &quot;Danzig IV&quot;. Biscuits was usually seen using Zildjian cymbals. His regular ride cymbal sound during his work with Danzig was a Zildjian 22&quot; Earth Ride. Biscuits also favored Paiste Rude cymbals. He used medium and rock ride cymbals as crashes. Biscuits&#x27; mainstay snare with Danzig was a Sonor steel model, though he also used a Ludwig piccolo snare.

With D.O.A. and Black Flag, Biscuits used an older blonde maple Slingerland kit and was also photographed using various colored Ludwig drums. For Social Distortion, Biscuits used a Boom Theory kit, including a Bridgedeck snare built by Al Adinolfi.

<doc id="231798" wikidata="Q767975" url="?curid=231798" title="Goliards">
<text>The goliards were a group of generally young clergy in Europe who wrote satirical Latin poetry in the 12th and 13th centuries of the Middle Ages. They were chiefly clerics who served at or had studied at the universities of France, Germany, Spain, Italy, and England, who protested against the growing contradictions within the church through song, poetry and performance. Disaffected and not called to the religious life, they often presented such protests within a structured setting associated with carnival, such as the Feast of Fools, or church liturgy.

==Etymology==
The derivation of the word is uncertain. It may come from the Latin &quot;gula,&quot; gluttony. It may also originate from a mythical &quot;Bishop Golias&quot;, a medieval Latin form of the name Goliath, the giant who fought King David in the Bible—thus suggestive of the monstrous nature of the goliard or, notes historian Christopher de Hamel, as &quot;those people beyond the edge of society&quot;. Another source may be &quot;gailliard,&quot; a &quot;gay fellow&quot;.

Many scholars believe the term &quot;goliard&quot; is derived from a letter between Bernard of Clairvaux and Pope Innocent II in which Bernard referred to Peter Abelard as Goliath, thus creating a connection between Goliath and the student adherents of Abelard. By the 14th century, the word goliard became synonymous with minstrel, and no longer referred to a particular group of clergy.

==Origins of the goliardic tradition==
The goliardic class is believed to have arisen from the need of younger sons to develop means of support. The medieval social convention of primogeniture meant that the eldest son inherited title and estate. This practice of bestowing the rights of inheritance upon the eldest son forced younger sons to seek other means by which to support themselves. Often, these younger sons went, or were sent, to the universities and monasteries of the day, where theology and preparation for clergy careers were a major focus. Many felt no particular affinity for religious office, and often could not secure an office even if they desired one because of an overabundance of those educated in theology. Consequently, over-educated, under-motivated clerics often adopted not the life of an ordered monk, but one mainly intent on the pursuit of carnal pleasures.

==Goliardic poetry==
The goliards, as scholars, often wrote their poetry in Latin. As a kind of traveling entertainer, the goliards composed many of their poems to be sung. These poems, or lyrics, focus on two overarching themes: depictions of the lusty lifestyle of the vagrant and satirical criticisms of society and the church.

Expressing their lusty lifestyle, the goliards wrote about the physicality of love, in contrast to the chivalric focus of the troubadours. They wrote drinking songs and reveled in riotous living. Their satirical poems directed at the church were inspired by their daily worlds, including mounting corruption in monasteries and escalating tensions among religious leaders. As a result of their rebellious writings against the church, the goliards were eventually denied the privileges of the clergy. Their strained relationship with the church, along with their vagabond lifestyle, also contributed to many poems describing the complaints of such a lifestyle. One of the largest and most famous collections of goliardic poetry is the &quot;Carmina Burana,&quot; translated as &quot;Songs from Beuern&quot;. It includes about 300 poems written mostly in Latin; &quot;few are in Old French, Provencal and Middle German.&quot;

==Satirical poets==
The satires were meant to mock and lampoon the church. For example, at St. Remy, the goliards went to mass in procession, with each trailing a herring on a string along the ground. The game was to step on the herring in front and keep your own herring from being trod upon. In some districts, goliards staged a celebration of the ass, in which a donkey dressed in a silly costume was led to the chancel rail where a cantor chanted a song of praise. When he paused, the audience would respond: &quot;He Haw, Sire Ass, He haw!&quot;. The University of Paris complained: 
Priests and clerks... dance in the choir dressed as women... they sing wanton songs. They eat black pudding at the altar itself, while the celebrant is saying Mass. They play dice on the altar. They cense with stinking smoke from the soles of old shoes. They run and leap throughout the church, without a blush of their own shame. Finally they drive about the town and its theatres in shabby carriages and carts, and rouse the laughter of their fellows and the bystanders in infamous performances, with indecent gestures and with scurrilous and unchaste words.

The goliards used sacred sources such as texts from the Roman Catholic Mass and Latin hymns and played upon them to secular and satirical purposes in their poems (such as in the Drinkers Mass). The jargon of scholastic philosophy also is frequently featured in their poems, either for satirical purposes, or because these concepts were familiar parts of the writers&#x27; working vocabulary. Their satires were almost uniformly directed against the church, attacking even the pope.

==Significance==
The word &quot;goliard&quot; outlived the original meaning. It was absorbed into the French and English literature of the 14th century, generally meaning &quot;jongleur&quot; or wandering minstrel, and no longer related to the original clerical association. It is thus used in &quot;Piers Plowman&quot;, and by Chaucer.

==Revisionist view==
This belief that the goliards were the authors of vast parts of this satirical and worldly poetry that originated in the twelfth and early thirteenth century has been criticized in recent revisionist work on the grounds that most traceable goliardic poets were an integral part of church hierarchy and often worked as teachers in the secular clergy. It also claims that they had no communality nor a single provable point of contact with the historical goliards. Instead, the revisionist thesis posits that the cathedral schools of northern France were the decisive historical context of goliardic poetry. Thus, it argues that &quot;goliardic poets&quot; on the one hand and &quot;goliards&quot; on the other hand need to be strictly distinguished. This fringe view runs contrary to the conclusions drawn from established and widely accepted historical and philological research.

<doc id="231804" wikidata="Q2665614" url="?curid=231804" title="Fran Brill">
<text>Fran Brill (born September 30, 1946) is an American retired actress and puppeteer, best known for her roles on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, as well as playing Sally Hayes in the Hal Ashby film &quot;Being There&quot; (1979), Dana Mardukas in the Martin Brest film &quot;Midnight Run&quot; (1988) and Lily Marvin in the Frank Oz film &quot;What About Bob?&quot; (1991).

Brill was honored with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 3rd Children&#x27;s and Family Emmy Awards in 2025.

==Life and career==
Brill was born in Chester, Pennsylvania, and is a native of Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, the daughter of Dr. and Mrs. Joe Brill. Her father was a physician. She is a graduate of Boston University College of Fine Arts. Her early experience in acting came when she was 15 and performed in summer stock theater.

She began her career in theater, making her Broadway debut portraying a student leader in &quot;Red, White and Maddox&quot; (1969). Her other theatrical roles include leads at the Roundabout Theatre, Manhattan Theater Club, Playwrights Horizons and many regional theaters including the Long Wharf, Yale Repertory Theatre, Arena Stage, the Mark Taper Forum and the Actors Theatre of Louisville. She has been nominated twice for a Drama Desk Award, for &quot;What Every Woman Knows&quot; (1976) and for &quot;Knuckle&quot; (1981), respectively.

From 1974-1975, Brill played Fran Bachman on NBC&#x27;s daytime drama &quot;How to Survive a Marriage&quot;. Her character struggled with sudden widowhood, and Brill received many condolence letters. Brill was also featured in episodes of &quot;The Guiding Light&quot;, &quot;All My Children&quot;, &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;, &quot;Lip Service&quot; and &quot;Kate and Allie&quot;.

In 1975, Brill portrayed first lady Rachel Jackson in &quot;First Ladies&#x27; Diaries&quot; on NBC-TV. She has also guest-starred on nighttime dramas such as &quot;Third Watch&quot;, &quot;Against the Law&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, and &quot;Law &amp; Order: SVU&quot;.

She has one known animation credit when she guest starred as Elisa and Eliza Stitch in &quot;Courage the Cowardly Dog&quot;.

Brill had no experience as a puppeteer when she joined &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, for which she has won an Emmy Award, and created Prairie Dawn. She also created and puppeteered the Muppets Zoe, Little Bird, and Betty Lou, among others. Playing Zoe, Brill appeared on the TV-series &quot;The West Wing&quot; as well as many home videos including &quot;Zoe&#x27;s Dance Moves&quot;. With the Muppets she did &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, &quot;The Jim Henson Hour&quot;, &quot;Dog City&quot;, and &quot;The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland&quot;.

She has also made commercials, preferring to do voiceovers rather than appearing on-camera, and has appeared in such films as &quot;Being There&quot;, &quot;What About Bob?&quot;, &quot;Midnight Run&quot;, and &quot;City Hall&quot;.

==Retirement==
In 2014, Brill announced that she was retiring from puppeteering on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;.

<doc id="231813" wikidata="Q891905" url="?curid=231813" title="Scottish independence">
<text>Scottish independence (; ) is the idea of Scotland regaining its independence and once again becoming a sovereign state, independent from the United Kingdom. The term Scottish independence refers to the political movement that is campaigning to bring it about.

Scotland was an independent kingdom through the Middle Ages, and fought wars to maintain its independence from England. The two kingdoms were united in personal union in 1603 when the Scottish King James VI became James I of England, and the two kingdoms united politically into one kingdom called Great Britain in 1707. This movement united the countries which ended the wars of independence and created relative peace. Political campaigns for Scottish self-government began in the 19th century, initially in the form of demands for home rule within the United Kingdom. Two referendums on devolution were held in 1979 and 1997, with a devolved Scottish Parliament being established on 1 July 1999.

The pro-independence Scottish National Party first became the governing party of the devolved parliament in 2007, and it won an outright majority of seats at the 2011 Scottish Parliament election. This led to an agreement between the Scottish and UK governments to hold the 2014 Scottish independence referendum. Voters were asked: &quot;Should Scotland be an independent country?&quot; 44.7 percent of voters answered &quot;Yes&quot; and 55.3 percent answered &quot;No&quot;, with a record voter turnout of 85 percent. This resulted in Scotland remaining in the United Kingdom.

A second referendum on independence has been proposed, particularly since the UK voted to leave the European Union in a June 2016 referendum and since pro-independence parties increased their majority in the 2021 Scottish Parliament election. In June 2022 Nicola Sturgeon proposed the date of 19 October 2023 for a new referendum on Scottish independence, subject to confirmation of its legality and constitutionality. In November 2022 the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom ruled that the Scottish Parliament did not have the power to legislate for a second referendum.

==History==
===Kingdom of Scotland===
Scotland emerged as an independent polity during the Early Middle Ages with some historians dating its foundation from the reign of Kenneth MacAlpin in 843. The level of independence of the Scottish kingdom was fought over by the Scottish kings and by the Norman and Angevin rulers of England who petitioned the Pope and other foreign rulers.

A watershed in the Scottish kingdom&#x27;s history was a succession crisis that erupted in 1290 when Edward I of England claimed the right of appointment to the Scottish throne. The Auld Alliance of Scotland and France against English interests was first invoked at that time and remained active through to the 16th century. The Wars of Scottish Independence ended in a renewed kingdom under Robert the Bruce (crowned 1306), whose grandson Robert II of Scotland was the first Scottish king of the House of Stuart.

===Union===
From 1603 Scotland and England shared the same monarch in a personal union when James VI of Scotland was declared King of England and Scotland in what was known as the Union of the Crowns. After James II and VII was deposed in 1688 amid Catholic-Protestant disputes, and as the line of Protestant Stuarts showed signs of failing (as indeed occurred in 1714), English fears that Scotland would select a different monarch, potentially causing conflict within Great Britain, and the bankruptcy of many Scottish nobles through the Darien scheme led to the formal union of the two kingdoms in 1707, with the Treaty of Union and subsequent Acts of Union, to form the Kingdom of Great Britain. Scottish Jacobite resistance to the union, led by descendants of James II and VII including Bonnie Prince Charlie, continued until 1746.

The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was formed by the Acts of Union 1800, which united the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland. Following the Irish War of Independence (1919–21) and the Anglo-Irish Treaty that ended the war, Ireland was partitioned into two states: Southern Ireland, which opted to become independent (and is now known as Republic of Ireland), and Northern Ireland, which – given its geographical extent which tended to ensure a Unionist majority – chose to remain within the United Kingdom.

===Home rule movement===

The &quot;Home Rule&quot; movement for a Scottish Assembly was first taken up in 1853 by the National Association for the Vindication of Scottish Rights, a body close to the Conservative Party. A key element in this movement was the comparison with Ireland. The original movement broadened its political appeal and soon began to receive Liberal Party backing. In 1885, the post of Secretary for Scotland and the Scottish Office were re-established to promote Scotland&#x27;s interests and express its concerns to the UK Parliament. In 1886, however, Liberal Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone introduced the Irish Home Rule Bill. It was not regarded as an immediate constitutional priority however, particularly when the Irish Home Rule Bill was defeated in the House of Commons.

Immediately before the First World War, the Liberal Government led by H. H. Asquith supported the concept of &quot;Home Rule all round&quot;, whereby Scottish home rule would follow the Irish home rule proposed in the Government of Ireland Act 1914. Asquith believed that there was an iniquity in that the component parts of the United Kingdom could come together to act together in common purposes, but those components could not deal with internal matters that did not require consent across the UK. This was not a nationalist philosophy, but instead Asquith was acting in the belief that federalism was the &quot;true basis of union&quot; and that centralising power in Westminster was a political blunder. A Scottish Home Rule bill was first presented to Parliament in 1913, but its progress was soon ended as Parliament focused on emergency measures necessitated by the First World War.

Unlike Ireland, which rebelled in the Easter Rising and fought a War of Independence, Scotland did not resist central rule. There was, however, a persistent demand for Scottish home rule. The Scottish Office was relocated to St Andrew&#x27;s House in Edinburgh during the 1930s. The Scottish Covenant was a petition to the UK Government asking for home rule. It was first proposed in 1930 by John MacCormick and formally written in 1949. The petition &quot;was eventually signed by two million people&quot; (the population of Scotland was recorded as 5,100,000 in the 1951 UK Census). The covenant was ignored by the main political parties. In 1950 the Stone of Destiny was removed from Westminster Abbey by a group of Scottish nationalist students.

The question of full independence, or the less controversial home rule, did not re-enter the political mainstream until 1960, after the famous Wind of Change speech by Conservative Prime Minister Harold Macmillan. This speech marked the start of a rapid decolonisation in Africa and the end of the British Empire. The UK had already suffered the international humiliation of the 1956 Suez Crisis, which showed that it was no longer the superpower it had been before World War II. For many in Scotland, this served to undermine one of the principal for the United Kingdom and also symbolised the end of popular imperialism and the Imperial unity that had united the then-prominent Scottish Unionist Party. The Unionist Party subsequently suffered a steady decline in support.

===1979 First devolution referendum===
The Scottish National Party (SNP) won their second-ever seat in the House of Commons in 1967, when Winnie Ewing was the unexpected winner of the 1967 Hamilton by-election. The seat was previously a safe Labour Party seat, and this victory brought the SNP to national prominence, leading to Edward Heath&#x27;s 1968 Declaration of Perth and the establishment of the Kilbrandon Commission. The discovery of North Sea oil off the east coast of Scotland in 1970 further invigorated the debate over Scottish independence. The SNP organised a hugely successful campaign entitled &quot;It&#x27;s Scotland&#x27;s oil&quot;, emphasising how the discovery of oil could benefit Scotland&#x27;s struggling deindustrialising economy and its populace. At the February 1974 general election, seven SNP MPs were elected. The general election resulted in a hung parliament, so Prime Minister Harold Wilson called a second election for October 1974, when the SNP performed even better than in February, winning 11 seats and obtaining over 30% of the total vote in Scotland.

In January 1974, the Conservative government had commissioned the McCrone report, written by Professor Gavin McCrone, a leading government economist, to report on the viability of an independent Scotland. He concluded that oil would have given an independent Scotland one of the strongest currencies in Europe. The report went on to say that officials advised government ministers on how to take &quot;the wind out of the SNP sails&quot;. A common myth regarding the report is that when handed over to the incoming Labour government and classified as secret because of Labour fears over the surge in Scottish National Party popularity, the document came to light only in 2005, when the SNP obtained the report under the Freedom of Information Act 2000. McCrone himself has rejected this claim.

The Labour Party, led by Harold Wilson, won the October 1974 general election with the very narrow majority of only three seats. Following their election to Parliament, the SNP MPs pressed for the creation of a Scottish Assembly: a viewpoint which was given added credibility by the conclusions of the Kilbrandon Commission. However, opponents demanded that a referendum be held on the issue. Although the Labour Party and the Scottish National Party both officially supported devolution, support was split in both parties. Labour was divided between those who favoured devolution and those who wanted to maintain a full central Westminster government. In the SNP, there was division between those who saw devolution as a stepping stone to independence and those who feared it might detract from that ultimate goal. The resignation of Harold Wilson from office in 1976 brought James Callaghan to power, but his small majority was eroded by several by-election losses, and the government became increasingly unpopular. Deals were made with the SNP and Plaid Cymru to hold referendums on devolution in exchange for their support, helping to prolong the government&#x27;s life.

The result of the referendum in Scotland was a narrow majority in favour of devolution (52% to 48%), but a condition of the referendum was that 40% of the total electorate should vote in favour in order to make it valid. But the turnout was only 63.6%, so only 32.9% of the electorate voted &quot;Yes&quot;. The Scotland Act 1978 was consequently repealed in March 1979 by a vote of 301–206 in Parliament. In the wake of the referendum, the supporters of the bill conducted a protest campaign under the slogan &quot;Scotland said yes&quot;. They said that the 40% rule was undemocratic and that the referendum results justified the establishment of the assembly. Campaigners for a &quot;No&quot; vote countered that voters had been told before the referendum that failing to vote was as good as a &quot;No&quot;. It was therefore incorrect to conclude that the relatively low turnout was entirely due to voter apathy.

In protest, the SNP withdrew their support from the government. A motion of no confidence was then tabled by the Conservatives and supported by the SNP, the Liberals and Ulster Unionists. It passed by one vote on 28 March 1979, forcing the May 1979 general election, which was won by the Conservatives led by Margaret Thatcher. Prime Minister Callaghan described the decision of the SNP to bring down the Labour government as &quot;turkeys voting for Christmas&quot;. The SNP group was reduced from 11 MPs to 2 at the 1979 general election, while devolution was opposed by the Conservative governments led by Margaret Thatcher and John Major.

===1997 Second devolution referendum===
Supporters of Scottish independence continued to hold mixed views on the Home Rule movement, which included many supporters of union who wanted devolution within the framework of the United Kingdom. Some saw it as a stepping stone to independence, while others wanted to go straight for independence.

In the years of the Conservative government after 1979, the Campaign for a Scottish Assembly was established, eventually publishing the Claim of Right 1989. This led to the Scottish Constitutional Convention. The convention promoted consensus on devolution on a cross-party basis, though the Conservative Party refused to co-operate and the Scottish National Party withdrew from the discussions when it became clear that the convention was unwilling to discuss Scottish independence as a constitutional option. Arguments against devolution and the Scottish Parliament, levelled mainly by the Conservative Party, were that the Parliament would create a &quot;slippery slope&quot; to Scottish independence and provide the pro-independence Scottish National Party with a route to government. Prime Minister John Major campaigned during the 1997 general election on the slogan &quot;72 hours to save the union&quot;. His party ultimately suffered the worst electoral defeat in 91 years.

The Labour Party won the 1997 general election in a landslide, and Donald Dewar as Secretary of State for Scotland agreed to the proposals for a Scottish Parliament. A referendum was held in September and 74.3% of those who voted approved the devolution plan (44.87% of the electorate). The Parliament of the United Kingdom subsequently approved the Scotland Act 1998 which created an elected Scottish Parliament with control over most domestic policy. In May 1999, Scotland held its first election for a devolved parliament, and in July 1999, the Scottish Parliament held session for the first time since the previous parliament had been adjourned in 1707, after a gap of 292 years. Donald Dewar of the Labour Party subsequently became the First Minister of Scotland, while the Scottish National Party became the main opposition party. The egalitarian song &quot;A Man&#x27;s A Man for A&#x27; That&quot;, by Robert Burns, was performed at the opening ceremony.

The Scottish Parliament is a unicameral legislature comprising 129 members. 73 members (57 pc) represent individual constituencies and are elected on a first past the post system. 56 members (43 pc) are elected in eight different electoral regions by the additional member system. Members serve for a four-year term. The monarch appoints one Member of the Scottish Parliament, on the nomination of the Parliament, to be First Minister, with the convention being that the leader of the party with the largest number of seats is appointed First Minister, although any member who can command the confidence of a majority of the chamber could conceivably be appointed First Minister. All other Ministers are appointed and dismissed by the First Minister, and together they make up the Scottish Government, the executive arm of government.

The Scottish Parliament has legislative authority for all non-reserved matters relating to Scotland, and has a limited power to vary income tax, nicknamed the Tartan Tax, a power it did not exercise and which was later replaced by wider tax-varying powers. The Scottish Parliament can refer devolved matters back to Westminster to be considered as part of United Kingdom-wide legislation by passing a Legislative Consent Motion if United Kingdom-wide legislation is considered to be more appropriate for certain issues. The programmes of legislation enacted by the Scottish Parliament since 1999 have seen a divergence in the provision of public services compared to the rest of the United Kingdom. For instance, the costs of a university education, and care services for the elderly are free at point of use in Scotland, while fees are paid in the rest of the UK. Scotland was the first country in the UK to ban smoking in enclosed public places in March 2006.

===2014 independence referendum===


In its manifesto for the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, the Scottish National Party (SNP) pledged to hold an independence referendum by 2010. After winning the election, the SNP-controlled Scottish Government published a white paper entitled &quot;Choosing Scotland&#x27;s Future&quot;, which outlined options for the future of Scotland, including independence. Scottish Labour, the Scottish Conservatives and Scottish Liberal Democrats opposed a referendum offering independence as an option. Prime Minister Gordon Brown also publicly attacked the independence option. The three main parties opposed to independence instead formed a Commission on Scottish Devolution, chaired by Kenneth Calman. This reviewed devolution and considered all constitutional options apart from independence. In August 2009, the Scottish Government announced that the Referendum (Scotland) Bill, 2010, which would detail the question and conduct of a possible referendum on the issue of independence, would be part of its legislative programme for 2009–10. The Bill was not expected to be passed, because of the SNP&#x27;s status as a minority government and the opposition of all other major parties in Parliament. In September 2010, the Scottish Government announced that no referendum would occur before the 2011 Scottish Parliament election.

The SNP won an overall majority in the Scottish Parliament at the 2011 Scottish election. First Minister Alex Salmond stated his desire to hold a referendum &quot;in the second half of the parliament&quot;, which would place it in 2014 or 2015. In January 2012, the UK Government offered to provide the Scottish Parliament with the specific powers to hold a referendum, providing it was &quot;fair, legal and decisive&quot;. Negotiations continued between the two governments until October 2012, when the Edinburgh Agreement was reached. The Scottish Independence Referendum (Franchise) Act 2013 was passed by the Scottish Parliament on 27 June 2013 and received Royal Assent on 7 August 2013. On 15 November 2013, the Scottish Government published &quot;Scotland&#x27;s Future&quot;, a 670-page white paper laying out the case for independence and the means through which Scotland might become an independent country.

After a protracted period of negotiation, a public debate between Salmond and Better Together leader Alistair Darling was arranged. On the morning before the televised debate, a joint statement, pledging greater devolved powers to Scotland in the event of a &quot;No&quot; vote, was signed by Prime Minister David Cameron (Leader of the Conservative Party), Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg (Leader of the Liberal Democrats), and Leader of the Opposition Ed Miliband (Leader of the Labour Party).

The BBC website announced the final result of the referendum at 06:24 on 19 September 2014: the &quot;No&quot; vote prevailed with 55% (2,001,926) of the votes from an overall voter turnout of 84.5%. Chief counting officer Mary Pitcaithly stated: &quot;It is clear that the majority of people voting have voted No to the referendum question.&quot; The &quot;Yes&quot; vote received 45% (1,617,989) support—the winning total needed was 1,852,828. Results were compiled from 32 council areas, with Glasgow backing independence—voting 53.5% &quot;Yes&quot; to 46.5% &quot;No&quot; (turnout in the area was 75%)—and Edinburgh voting against independence by 61% to 39% (turnout in the area was 84%). Darling stated in his post-result speech, &quot;The silent have spoken&quot;, while Salmond stated, &quot;I accept the verdict of the people, and I call on all of Scotland to follow suit in accepting the democratic verdict&quot;.

===UK withdrawal from the European Union===

In 2016, the UK voted to leave the EU in the Brexit referendum, however Scotland voted to remain by 62% to 38%. Leading pro-independence figures suggested a second independence referendum. For example, First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon said that she was looking at all options to &quot;secure our place in the EU&quot;, and that a second referendum was &quot;highly likely&quot;. However, a spokesperson for Prime Minister Theresa May said that &quot;The prime minister and the government does not believe that there is a mandate for [a second referendum]. There was one only two years ago. There was an extremely high turnout and there was a resounding result in favour of Scotland remaining in the UK&quot;.

At the 2019 United Kingdom general election, the SNP won 48 out of 59 Scottish seats. Sturgeon asked Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his consent to hold another referendum. However, Johnson declined her request. He said that Sturgeon and her predecessor Alex Salmond had promised that the 2014 referendum would be a &quot;once in a generation&quot; vote.

Shortly before the UK left the European single market, the Boris Johnson regime sought through the United Kingdom Internal Market Act 2020 to restrict the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament. The primary purpose of the act is to constrain the capacity of the devolved institutions to use their regulatory autonomy. The legislation undermines the capability of the Scottish legislature to make different economic or social choices from those made in Westminster. In a January 2021 editorial concerning rising support for independence and its potential to break up the union, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; indicates that the Internal Market Act may serve to further the cause of independence: This view was mirrored by the Scottish Government in a report published in March 2021, which states that the act is &quot;radically undermining the powers and democratic accountability of the Scottish Parliament.&quot;

=== 2021 Scottish elections ===
In January 2021, Nicola Sturgeon said that another referendum would be held if pro-independence parties won a majority of seats at the 2021 Scottish Parliament election. Opposition parties criticised the SNP, stating that they were putting independence ahead of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Although the SNP fell one seat short of winning outright, the eight seats won by the Scottish Greens meant that pro-independence parties had won a majority of seats in the election. Speaking after the election, both SNP and Conservative representatives said that a referendum would not occur during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

The Scottish Government plans to hold a second independence referendum before the end of the current Scottish Parliament. Nicola Sturgeon has indicated the vote would be held by 2023. Boris Johnson has stated that he would not grant authorisation for a referendum, but the SNP has indicated it is prepared to hold a referendum regardless. According to a poll of 1000 voters conducted for &quot;Politico Europe&quot;, 43% said they agreed that Scotland should only hold a second independence referendum if the U.K. government agrees to it.

In January 2022, &quot;The Herald&quot; reported that the Scottish Government were paying eleven civil servants a total of £700,000 per year to plan for Scottish independence. In its response to the newspaper, the government stated &quot;As set out in the 2021/22 Programme for Government (PfG), the Scottish Government will work to ensure that a legitimate and constitutional referendum can be held within this Parliament, and if the Covid crisis is over, within the first half of this Parliament.&quot; The Scottish Conservatives constitution spokesperson Donald Cameron and Scottish Liberal Democrats leader Alex Cole-Hamilton opposed the spending. Cole-Hamilton said &quot;to spend more than £500,000 on a fool&#x27;s errand of another prospectus for independence makes it less of a white paper and more of a white elephant&quot; and suggested the SNP and Green Party are &quot;off their rockers&quot;. SNP President Michael Russell remarked that the SNP and Green Party&#x27;s victory in the election indicated they have a mandate to hold a second referendum to make Scotland an independent country.

=== Proposed 2023 independence referendum ===

On 28 June 2022, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon proposed to hold a second Scottish independence referendum on 19 October 2023, provided that the legality and constitutionality of the referendum is guaranteed. She set out a three-stage process, starting with the Scottish Government making a request for a Section 30 order (parliamentary powers) to hold a referendum. If that was rejected, it would ask the UK Supreme Court to adjudicate whether the Scottish Parliament could legislate for a referendum without that transfer of powers. If that was also rejected, she wished to turn the next UK general election into a &quot;de facto&quot; referendum.

A week later, Prime Minister Boris Johnson rejected the request for a Section 30 transfer of powers. The Scottish Government lodged a case with the Supreme Court to determine whether the powers to hold a referendum are within the competence of the Scottish Parliament. A hearing took place on 11 and 12 October 2022, and a month later the Supreme Court ruled that the Scottish Parliament does not have the power to legislate for an independence referendum.

Before the Supreme Court hearing Nicola Sturgeon said that, in the eventuality of the Court ruling that the Scottish Parliament did not have the authority to act unilaterally, the SNP would contest the next UK general election as a &quot;de facto&quot; referendum on independence. This tactic has been previously used by Irish and Catalan nationalists. It has been criticised on the grounds that &quot;elections and [...] referendums [...] are quite distinct&quot; and that general elections &quot;[are] often about a range of issues&quot; and &quot;it&#x27;s not for a political party to dictate the terms of an election&quot;. Prof Jim Gallagher, chair of Our Scottish Future, said that &quot;whatever UK government emerges won&#x27;t treat it as having been an independence referendum&quot;.

==Legal position==
=== Power to declare independence ===
While in Northern Ireland, the system of devolution includes a provision for independence referendums, under the Scottish devolution framework, there is no equivalent provision. Therefore, Scottish independence would need to be enacted exceptionally by a competent authority. Due to the UK having no codified constitution, there is dispute over which authorities have competence to enact Scottish independence.

The UK Parliament retains parliamentary sovereignty over the United Kingdom as a whole. Under this principle, the UK Parliament could enact Scottish independence without the need for a referendum. In &quot;AXA General Insurance Ltd and others v HM Advocate and others&quot;, the Deputy President of the Supreme Court, Lord Hope of Craighead, stated that &quot;the sovereignty of the Crown in Parliament [...] is the bedrock of the British constitution. Sovereignty remains with the United Kingdom Parliament.&quot; However, the application of the principle of parliamentary sovereignty to Scotland has been disputed. In &quot;MacCormick v The Lord Advocate&quot;, the Lord President of the Court of Session, Lord Cooper of Culross stated &quot;obiter dicta&quot; that &quot;the principle of the unlimited sovereignty of Parliament is a distinctively English principle which has no counterpart in Scottish Constitutional Law.&quot; It has been suggested that the doctrine of popular sovereignty, proclaimed in the 1320 Declaration of Arbroath , articulated by Scottish political thinkers like George Buchanan and reasserted by the Claim of Right 1989 (signed by nearly every Labour and Liberal Democrat MP in Scotland at the time), is of greater relevance to Scotland.

Some lawyers have said that Parliament cannot repeal the Acts of Union because the &quot;Treaty of Union&quot; is a treaty in international law, made by two no longer existing, independent states. The law scholar David Walker wrote that regardless of any amendment or repeal of the Acts, the &quot;Treaty&quot; would remain in force because Parliament cannot alter the terms of international treaties. Professors James Crawford and Alan Boyle write that it is unlikely the &quot;Treaty of Union&quot; can be considered a treaty, but rather, as Smith wrote, it was a &#x27;record of negotiations&#x27; and that the UK could not &#x27;be bound by a treaty to which it was not party&#x27;. This notion that Parliament cannot amend the terms of the Union&#x27;s creation is challenged by the fact that the Acts have been successfully amended by the Parliament several times. David Walker writes that simply because Parliament purports to amend an Act does not mean it has done so. When HM Government ratifies a treaty, it does not however bring it into domestic law, it only creates certain rights or duties for the Government. An Act is only brought into domestic law by Parliament legislating thus. According to a 2017 Supreme Court ruling, ministers cannot make changes to UK constitutional arrangements without an Act of Parliament. There is no legal role for the Scottish Parliament or Government in treaties and under devolution, treaty-making is the sole responsibility of the UK Government.

The legality of any UK constituent country attaining &quot;de facto&quot; independence or declaring unilateral independence outside the framework of British constitutional convention is debatable. Under international law, a unilateral declaration might satisfy the principle of the &quot;declarative theory of statehood&quot;, but not the &quot;constitutive theory of statehood&quot;. Some legal opinion following the Supreme Court of Canada&#x27;s decision on what steps Quebec would need to take to secede is that Scotland would be unable to unilaterally declare independence under international law if the UK Government permitted a referendum on an unambiguous question on secession. The SNP have not sought a unilateral act, but rather state that a positive vote for independence in a referendum would have &quot;enormous moral and political force... impossible for a future [Westminster] government to ignore&quot;, and hence would give the Scottish Government a mandate to negotiate for the passage of an act of the UK Parliament providing for Scotland&#x27;s secession, in which Westminster renounces its sovereignty over Scotland.

The United Nations Charter enshrines the right of peoples to self-determination, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights also guarantees peoples&#x27; right to change nationality; the UK is a signatory to both documents. Politicians in both the Scottish and UK parliaments have endorsed the right of the Scottish people to self-determination, including former UK Prime Ministers John Major and Margaret Thatcher.

=== Power to hold an independence referendum ===

The issue of the Scottish Government&#x27;s power to hold and the Scottish Parliament&#x27;s competence to legislate for an independence referendum is a subject of intense debate both inside and outside Scotland. In November 2022 the UK Supreme Court gave a judgment that the Scottish Parliament does not have the power to legislate for an independence referendum. The Scotland Act 1998 reserved powers over &quot;the Union of the Kingdoms of Scotland and England&quot; to the UK Parliament. Any provision is outwith the competence of the Scottish Parliament if &quot;it relates to reserved matters&quot; under Section 29(2) of the Act. This formed the basis of the UK Supreme Court&#x27;s judgment on the Scottish Parliament&#x27;s competence to legislate on the matter.

To ensure the undisputed constitutional legality of the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, the Scottish and UK Governments signed the Edinburgh Agreement stating that both would accept and &quot;continue to work together constructively in the light of the outcome [of the referendum], whatever it is, in the best interests of the people of Scotland and of the rest of the United Kingdom&quot;. The agreement, with the subsequent approval of the UK Parliament, gave the Scottish Parliament special legal authority to hold an independence referendum before the end of 2014.

No such agreement has been reached in respect of a second referendum, throwing doubt over its legal status. In December 2019, Martin Keatings, a pro-independence independent candidate, sought a declarator to the Court of Session. However Lady Carmichael said the case lacked standing due to its hypothetical nature. Nevertheless, Mr Keatings brought an appeal forward in April 2021 as the Scottish Government had now published a bill, however this appeal was lost.

With the publication of the draft Independence Referendum Bill on 22 March 2021 the question of legality was raised again. On 28 June 2022, Sturgeon proposed to hold a referendum in 2023, provided that the legality and constitutionality of the referendum is guaranteed. The Scottish Government stated that their proposed referendum is &quot;consultative, not self-executing&quot;. In UK law, a referendum can be consultative (such as the Brexit referendum) or determinative (such as the AV referendum, which, if passed, would have automatically brought in provisions for the Alternative Vote). The Scotland Act does not explicitly state whether non-binding referendums on reserve powers were reserved. In the Scottish Government&#x27;s written case published in July 2022, the Lord Advocate observed that &quot;the Union of the Kingdoms of Scotland and England has been superseded as a matter of law and exists only as an historical fact. The [Scotland Act] would therefore reserve something that no longer exists.&quot;

The Scottish Government lodged a case with the Supreme Court to determine whether the powers to hold a referendum are within the competence of the Scottish Parliament, and a hearing took place on 11 and 12 October 2022. A month later, the UK Supreme Court gave a judgment that the Scottish Parliament does not have the power to hold an independence referendum because it relates to the Union of England and Scotland and the sovereignty of the UK Parliament, which are matters reserved to the UK Parliament.

==Issues==

=== Culture ===
In 2014, the Scottish Government wrote that &quot;[Scotland&#x27;s] approach [to culture] has been, and will continue to be, distinct from that of Westminster&quot;. The Scottish Government position was that Scottish independence would give the Scottish Government more powers to encourage culture and creative sectors. In the event of independence, the Scottish Government planned to increase domestic creative production opportunities, such as by setting up a new national broadcaster, while maintaining access to current TV channels and with no additional cost to viewers and listeners.

=== Democracy ===
The concept of a democratic deficit is the most frequently invoked argument in favour of independence. England has a majority (84%) of the UK population. Thus, constituency results for Scotland rarely affect the outcome of general elections. From the 1960s onwards, average voting patterns in Scotland and England have diverged. Scotland has only elected a majority of governing MPs in three of the 11 UK general elections since 1979. Devolution was intended to close this deficit, but Brexit, which happened despite 62% of voters in Scotland voting against it, has highlighted this concern. The Conservative Party, which often forms the UK Government by winning general elections, has not won a plurality of seats in Scotland since 1955.

Underpinning the democratic deficit argument is an assumption that Scotland is a nation with a right to self-determination. Were Scotland independent, Scotland&#x27;s population would possess full decision-making power in regard to the political affairs of its nation. Alex Salmond stated in a May 2012 launch that &quot;the people who live in Scotland are best placed to make the decisions that affect Scotland.&quot;

In January 2023, the UK Government blocked the Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill from going to royal assent after it passed the Scottish Parliament 86 to 39. The UK Government overruled the bill by using for the first ever time Section 35 powers under the Scotland Act; the justification for the move was that they believed it would impact equalities legislation, which is reserved to Westminster. Nicola Sturgeon responded, arguing that the block had &#x27;no grounds&#x27; and constituted a &#x27;full-frontal attack on democracy&#x27;.

=== Nationality and citizenship ===
The United Kingdom is a plurinational, rather than multinational, state, where overlapping national identities exist. According to Keating, both Scottishness and Britishness can be understood as a national identity and one can hold one of them alone or both at the same time. Many people in Scotland have multiple national identities. 59% in Scotland surveyed by the BBC in 2018 said they felt strongly British, though the figure is lower than the equivalent in Wales (79%) and England (82%). However, the majority of Scots feel closer affinity to a Scottish, rather than a British national identity. In a 2021 survey, when asked about their national identity and only allowed to pick one option, 64% of Scottish residents identify as Scottish and 29% as British. Furthermore, many in Scotland do not feel a national affinity to the UK at all. In a poll taken in early 2021 by Panelbase, a third of respondents in Scotland said they felt Scottish but not British.

A category of &#x27;Scottish citizenship&#x27; does not currently exist, as nationality law is reserved to Westminster. In the event of independence, Scotland and the rest of the UK would need to set new citizenship laws to allocate British and/or Scottish citizenship to existing British citizens and set out Scotland&#x27;s new nationality laws. For the 2014 referendum, the Yes side said Scotland would tolerate dual citizenship. British citizens habitually resident in Scotland and Scottish-born British citizens elsewhere would have been able to become Scottish citizens automatically. SNP MP Pete Wishart said in 2013 that Scots would &#x27;of course&#x27; be able to keep a UK passport, but Home Secretary Theresa May said Scots may not have that option.

=== Economy ===

Independence would mean a much greater change for business than devolution. While Scottish nationalists generally assert that independence would not be economically disruptive, unionists and the UK government tend to assert the opposite. Journalist Peter Jones writes that calculating the real economic impacts of independence (i.e. whether Scotland would be richer or poorer outwith the UK) is &quot;an extremely hazard, if not impossible, task&quot;.

If businesses concluded that independence would yield benefits, there could be positive economic effects. However, if businesses do not, they could postpone spending or investment plans or even leave Scotland entirely. Uncertainty caused by independence referendums can also have negative implications for financial markets and the wider economy, depending on the likelihood that separation wins. This uncertainty has impacts not only in Scotland, but in the whole of the UK. Due to the relative size of Scotland in the UK, any negative economic effects would be felt worse in Scotland.

Economic modelling by the Centre for Economic Performance found that independence would hit Scotland&#x27;s economy ‘two to three times’ harder than Brexit. According to their model, leaving the UK after Brexit could reduce Scottish income per capita between 6.5 per cent and 8.7 per cent, depending on trade barriers. Rejoining the EU would do little to mitigate the costs of Brexit, because the cost of removing trade barriers with the EU is outweighed by the cost of erecting trade barriers with the UK. Scotland&#x27;s largest trading partner is the rest of the UK, which accounts for £51.2 billion in exported goods and services, compared to only £16.1 billion to EU countries. According to Nicola Sturgeon, a customs border with the rest of the UK would be needed. 42% of those in Scotland think it would be financially worse off outside the Union (compared to 36% who think it would be better).

==== Natural resources ====
The nationalist position is that only an independent Scotland can fully utilise and exploit its national resources, including North Sea oil and gas, for the benefit of its population. According to the Scottish Government led by Alex Salmond in 2014, 64% of the EU&#x27;s oil reserves existed in Scottish waters, while the David Hume Institute think tank estimated that &quot;Scotland is sitting on oil and gas reserves worth up to £4 trillion&quot;. Investment in and production from the North Sea oilfields dropped sharply after Conservative chancellor George Osborne imposed punitive taxes, undercutting the projected revenue an independent Scotland could claim.

David Maddox, writing for &quot;The Scotsman&quot; in 2008, pointed to a future Peak oil decline in North Sea oil revenue, within ten years oil revenue had fallen to 10% of the 2008 peak. Some, such as Ruth Davidson of the Scottish Conservatives, wish to reduce public spending and devolve more fiscal powers to the Scottish Parliament in order to address this issue within the broader framework of the Union. Outlying regions such as Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles would be disadvantaged or deserve a greater share of oil revenue.

==== Public finances ====
An independent Scotland would have full autonomy over decisions on tax, spending and borrowing. Scotland would be able to issue sovereign debt and set fiscal limits. According to the Scottish Government, it is clear that Scotland currently pays its way within the UK. The Scottish Government has proposed setting up a &#x27;New Scotland Fund&#x27; to provide capital investment and boost growth. According to the charity &quot;Institute for Fiscal Studies&quot;, this fund would likely need to be funded by additional borrowing.

According to an analysis by the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, an independent Scotland would have a large hole in its public finances. The paper&#x27;s analysis suggests this would be due to the combined effect of lower than expected tax revenues, Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic, which have increased the country&#x27;s budget deficit. A publication by the charity &quot;Institute for Fiscal Studies&quot; claims that in 2020-21 (during the COVID-19 pandemic), the national deficit of Scotland was between 22% and 25% of national income, though this is predicted to fall after the pandemic. The same publication claims that if it leaves the UK by the middle of the decade, Scotland would have a deficit of almost 10 per cent of GDP. If correct, this would mean Scotland would need to raise taxes or cut public spending by the equivalent of £1765 per person after independence to make the deficit sustainable. Short-term forecasts of public spending are inherently uncertain, but can still provide useful predictions. A report published by the Sustainable Growth Commission set up by the SNP to make recommendations on the economy of an independent Scotland stated that the deficit would need to be cut to 3 per cent of GDP.

==== Currency ====
Before the 2014 referendum, there were questions over the currency of an independent Scotland and whether it would continue to use the Pound sterling, adopt the Euro, or introduce a Scottish currency (often referred to as the &quot;Scottish pound&quot;). Uncertainty could be brought in the immediate aftermath of independence, particularly disagreement as to how Scotland would be treated in relation to the European Union, and the unlikelihood of the Bank of England accepting a currency union with an independent Scotland. The chairman of HSBC, Douglas Flint, warned in August 2014 of uncertainty if there was an independent Scottish currency, or if Scotland joined the Eurozone, which could result in capital flight. In 2018, the SNP suggested keeping the pound for a period after Scottish independence. Dame DeAnne Julius, a founding member of the Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee, has called this a &quot;hugely risky experiment for Scotland&quot;.

Nicola Sturgeon announced in October 2022 her intention for Scotland to continue using the pound sterling after independence. Monetary policy in this period would be set by the Bank of England. Scotland would subsequently develop a central Scottish bank and would move to a Scottish pound &quot;when the economic conditions were right&quot;. The establishment of a Scottish pound would be at the decision of the Scottish Parliament, once the Scottish Central Bank has established credibility, foreign exchange reserves are sufficient and Scotland is fiscally sustainable. The Scottish pound could run on a fixed or floating exchange rate.

=== Defence ===
With control over defence and foreign policy, an independent Scotland could demand the removal of Trident nuclear weapons, which are based in the Firth of Clyde. Nuclear disarmament is an issue long associated with the campaign for an independent Scotland, as outlined in the House of Commons Defence Committee&#x27;s white paper &quot;The future of the UK&#x27;s strategic nuclear deterrent: the White Paper&quot; of 2006–2007. The Scottish Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament supports independence on this basis.

Scottish voters are in favour of the Trident nuclear deterrent being in Scotland. Even in the event of a vote for independence, 45 per cent of Scots polled in 2022 think the nuclear deterrent should be maintained in Scotland, compared to 34 percent against. While in the Union, 58% of Scots believe in the retention of the nuclear deterrent and only 20% definitely want it axed. In the event that Scottish independence meant the nuclear deterrent could no longer be in Scotland, there is a risk that the costs of relocation would make keeping a nuclear deterrent in the British Isles unfeasible. In 2019, the NATO Secretary General said the maintenance of a British nuclear deterrent is important to NATO. In 2022, 73 percent of Scots would want an independent Scotland to be part of NATO and only 8 percent oppose this.

The &quot;UK Defence Journal&quot; writes that the defence of Scotland is best served as part of the UK. Scotland is said to benefit from a collective defence force and an independent Scotland would weaken the UK&#x27;s defence posture. There are many UK defence installations in Scotland other than Trident and many Scottish people serve in the British Armed Forces. There are 12,000 service personnel in Scotland and a further 18,500 civilian jobs in the armed forces defence industry. It is expected Scotland would lose defence jobs. For example, Lord West said Scotland could lose 20,000 or 25,000 jobs.

In 2014, a UK Government report stated that Scotland &quot;plays an integral part in all aspects of the UK&#x27;s defence&quot;. The report said the new Scottish Government would need to set up much defence infrastructure and services from scratch, and that existing defence assets in Scotland are well integrated into a UK-wide defence structure. According to the UK Government, it would be difficult for an independent Scotland to co-opt existing UK armed force units based or recruited in Scotland.

=== Foreign affairs ===

Under the Scottish Government&#x27;s 2014 plans for independence, Scotland would have applied to become a full and equal member of the United Nations, NATO and the European Union and many other international organisations. With an voice in international politics, Scottish independence campaigners believe the nation&#x27;s global influence would increase in regard to the defence of its national interests and the promotion of its values. Furthermore, Scottish embassies could be established globally to promote Scotland internationally, and to lobby other governments on the nation&#x27;s behalf.

During the 2014 referendum, a major argument against independence was that Scotland would be outside the EU. Scotland is very supportive of EU membership, with 62% voting to remain in the 2016 EU referendum. Since Brexit, many have called for a second independence referendum to have a chance to re-enter the EU.

As part of the UK, Scotland is part of NATO, the G7, and as a permanent member of the UN Security Council. 82% of Scots believe that UK membership of these organisations is important. Opponents of further integration of the European Union have stated that independence, within Europe but outside the &quot;EU three&quot;, would mean that Scotland would be more marginalised because, as a relatively small independent country, Scotland would be unable to resist the demands of larger member states.

=== Links with the rest of the UK ===

There are strong historical and contemporary ties between Scotland and the rest of the UK from the Reformation and Union of Crowns, to Scottish involvement in the growth and development of the British Empire and contribution of the Scottish Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution. Contemporary popular culture is also shared, primarily through the prevalence of the English language. Almost half of the Scottish population have relatives in England. At the time of the 2011 census, approximately 700,000 adults who were born in Scotland lived in the rest of the UK, while about 470,000 adults who were born elsewhere in the UK had moved to live in Scotland. There are also significant economic links with the Scottish military-industrial complex, and as argued by David Cameron, close links within the financial sector.

In &quot;Scotland&#x27;s Future&quot;, the Scottish Government wrote that an independent Scotland would &quot;not affect the many other ties that bind Scotland to the other nations of the UK&quot; and that there will still be a social union of family, history, culture and language within the British Isles. The UK Government wrote that a relationship of two sovereign states based on self-interest is &#x27;profoundly differently&#x27; from being part of one state, and thus any co-operation would need to be in the interest of the rest of the UK, as well as Scotland. In the &quot;Building a New Scotland&quot; series of papers, published to support the argument for independence in a proposed second independence referendum, the Scottish Government advocates that &quot;independence would mark a new phase in the evolution of Scotland’s relationships with the UK and Ireland. While the ‘social union’ of shared histories, sport, culture, languages, and family ties would continue as before, a renewed Scottish democracy would be a force for good across these islands&quot;. The Scottish Government advocates that an independent Scotland &quot;will have close, mutually beneficial relationships across these islands on defence and security matters&quot;.

The Scottish Government proposes that a reformed British-Irish Council would &quot;provide a formal forum for managing some of these relationships, complementing regular bilateral discussions&quot;.

Beginning close to the time of the 2014 referendum, it became a topic of discussion across British news outlets that Doncaster in South Yorkshire, England has a claim to belonging to Scotland, by technicality. This originates from the 1136 and 1139 Treaties of Durham, in which David I of Scotland and his son Henry were granted the Lordship of Doncaster by Stephen of England to dissuade David from invading England. Historians observed that no known agreement in writing ever returned to Doncaster to England, unlike other territory offered from the north by Stephen, which is more commonly documented as being returned as a condition of the 1157 Treaty of Chester. Despite the 2014 referendum not winning a majority vote, the claim popularised the idea of Doncaster joining Scotland in the future event of independence to the extent that on 8th October 2020, and again on 29th March 2022, petitions were submitted to the UK Parliament petitions website titled &quot;Affirm that Doncaster is legally part of Scotland&quot; and &quot;Honour Scotland&#x27;s claim on Doncaster by giving them power over Doncaster&quot;. In response to both on their respective webpages, Parliament confirmed that in the event of another independence referendum, the UK Government would allow Doncaster a local referendum on leaving the United Kingdom to join the new independent Scotland as an exclave if it was demanded by petition first, provided that the independent Scotland consented to taking the city&#x27;s territory on top of a majority &quot;Yes&quot; vote. It was only not specified whether this would be applied to Doncaster itself, or all of the wider Metropolitan Borough of Doncaster, covering separate towns such as Dunscroft/Hatfield and Mexborough. Just eight months after the second petition was submitted, the borough acquired city status.

=== Comparison to Brexit ===
The &quot;Centre for Constitutional Change&quot; stated during the 2016 EU referendum campaign that the &quot;international relations aspect of the Brexit debate looks somewhat similar to the debate about Scottish independence&quot;. There is no agreed process for Scottish independence and there would be no negotiations of the terms of independence before a positive referendum result. Ruth Davidson has described &quot;independence because of Brexit&quot; as &quot;amputating your foot because you&#x27;ve stubbed your toe&quot;. The common use of the term Brexit has led some sources to describe Scottish independence as &quot;Scexit&quot;, a portmanteau of Scotland + exit.

==Support for independence==

Scottish independence is supported most prominently by the Scottish National Party, but other parties also support independence. Other pro-independence parties which have held representation in the Scottish Parliament or the UK Parliament include the Scottish Greens, the Alba Party and the Scottish Socialist Party. Other parties which support Scottish independence include the Independence for Scotland Party, and the Scottish Libertarian Party. At the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, 72 of the 129 seats available were won by pro-independence parties (64 SNP and 8 Greens). The independence movement consists of many factions with varying political views. The SNP wants Scotland to keep the monarchy (see personal union) and become an independent Commonwealth realm, similar to Canada, Australia or New Zealand. All of the other aforementioned pro-independence parties want Scotland to become an independent republic. The SSP has led republican protests and authored the Declaration of Calton Hill, calling for an independent republic.

The Independence Convention was set up in 2005, seeking &quot;Firstly, to create a forum for those of all political persuasions and none who support independence; and secondly, to be a national catalyst for Scottish independence.&quot; The Scottish Republican Socialist Movement is a Pan-Socialist independence movement that believes that Scotland should be made an independent republic. This movement has a Firebrand socialist ethos, however is not affiliated with the SSP or the Scottish Communist Party. It believes that a failure to become independent should lead to mass emigration elsewhere, or as put as a slogan &quot;Independence or Desertion&quot;.

Apart from the official Yes Scotland campaign for independence in the 2014 referendum, other groups in support of independence were formed at that time. This included the National Collective, an artist-driven movement which describes itself as &quot;an open and non-party political collaboration of talent focused on driving social and political change in Scotland through a variety of the arts&quot;. It was responsible for organising a mock referendum held at the University of Glasgow in February 2013. Another group, the Radical Independence Campaign, described itself as &quot;fighting for an independent Scotland that is for the millions not the millionaires&quot;. RIC was formed after the Radical Independence Conference 2012 in Glasgow, which was attended by at least 650 people and has been described as a &quot;[bringing together of] the Scottish Greens, the Scottish Socialists, some of the more militant trade unionists, nuclear-disarmament campaigners and anti-monarchist republicans&quot;.

During the 2014 referendum campaign, independence attracted little support from newspapers. The &quot;Sunday Herald&quot; was the only publication to endorse a &quot;Yes&quot; vote in the referendum. &quot;The National&quot;, a daily newspaper supporting independence, was launched in November 2014, in wake of the Yes Scotland campaign&#x27;s defeat.

In October 2014, the lobby group All Under One Banner (AUOB) was formed. AUOB stages regular public marches in support of Scottish independence throughout Scotland.

Proponents of Brexit and Scotland&#x27;s independence share relatively similar, but incompatible, objectives and difficulties. Despite this, those who voted for Brexit in 2016 tend to be more unionist than those who voted to remain. The BBC reported that 39% of those who voted Leave in 2016 would vote Yes, while 59% of those who voted Remain would do the same.

==Unionism==

The Conservative Party, Labour Party and Liberal Democrats, which all have seats in the Scottish Parliament, are in favour of unionism. In 2012 they established the cross-party Better Together campaign. Other parties that oppose Scottish independence include the UK Independence Party (UKIP), All for Unity, Reform UK, Abolish the Scottish Parliament, the British National Party (BNP), Britain First, the Scottish Unionist Party (SUP), and the Ulster unionist parties.

The campaign called &quot;Scotland in Union&quot; emerged after the 2014 independence referendum. It has encouraged a positive outlook on unionism, tactical voting in elections and promoted the Union more generally.&#x27;Scotland in Union&#x27; has been subject to criticism after records of its donor base were leaked, including many of the UK&#x27;s wealthy elite, with major landowners, Lords, aristocrats and CEOs of companies all listed. Scotland in Union claims to be a “grassroots” campaign. In late 2017, a new group called &quot;Unity UK&quot; was formed. Its supporters said that Unionists needed to be more supportive of Brexit and were critical of Scotland in Union&#x27;s &quot;agnostic&quot; stance on the issue.

Many leaders of foreign nations expressed support for Unionism during the 2014 independence referendum. Barack Obama expressed his support for a &quot;strong, robust and united&quot; UK. Then-Swedish Foreign Minister and former prime minister Carl Bildt opposed the &quot;Balkanisation&quot; of the British Isles.

The Orange Order, a Protestant brotherhood with thousands of members in Scotland, campaigned against Scottish independence, and formed a campaign group called British Together. In September 2014, it held a march of at least 15,000 Orangemen, loyalist bands and supporters from Scotland and across the UK; described as the biggest pro-Union demonstration of the campaign.

==Third option==

=== Potential UK Confederation membership ===

A Confederal UK has been proposed as a concept of constitutional reform of the United Kingdom, in which the countries of the United Kingdom; England, Scotland, Wales, as well as Northern Ireland become separate sovereign groups or states that pool certain key resources within a confederal system.

==Public opinion==
===Polling ahead of the 2014 referendum===

Many opinion polls were conducted about Scottish independence during the 2014 referendum campaign. Professor John Curtice stated in January 2012 that polling had shown support for independence at between 32% and 38% of the Scottish population. This had fallen somewhat since the SNP were first elected to become the Scottish Government in 2007. The research also showed, however, that the proportion of the population strongly opposed to independence had also declined. Curtice stated in April 2014 that support for independence had increased since December 2013, although there was disagreement between the polling companies as to the true state of public opinion. Polls in the run-up to the referendum vote showed a closing of the gap, with one YouGov poll giving the Yes campaign a 51–49 lead. In the referendum Scotland voted against independence by 55.3% to 44.7%, with an overall turnout of 84.5%.

===Polling since the 2014 referendum===

Since six weeks after the 2014 referendum, opinion polls have asked how people would vote in a proposed second referendum. Twenty-five polls were conducted in the year after the referendum, with seventeen of them having &quot;No&quot; as the predominant answer, seven having &quot;Yes&quot;, and one having an equal proportion of respondents for each opinion.

In the year from September 2016 to September 2017, 25 of 26 polls conducted showed &quot;No&quot; as the most popular answer and only one showed &quot;Yes&quot; as the most popular answer. &quot;No&quot; continued to show a lead in opinion polls until July 2019, when one poll by Lord Ashcroft showed a narrow majority for &quot;Yes&quot;. Professor John Curtice said after this poll was released that there had recently been a swing towards &quot;Yes&quot;, and that this was concentrated among people who had voted to &quot;Remain&quot; in the 2016 Brexit referendum.

This pro-independence trend continued into 2020, as three polls in the early part of the year put &quot;Yes&quot; support at between 50% and 52%. In October 2020, an Ipsos MORI/STV News poll saw support for independence at its highest ever level, with 58% saying they would vote &quot;Yes&quot;. As of December 2020, fifteen consecutive opinion polls had shown a lead for &quot;Yes&quot;. The run of polls showing a &quot;Yes&quot; lead continued into January 2021, although the average support for Yes was down by two percentage points compared to polls by the same companies in late 2020. Polls conducted in early March 2021, following testimony by Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon at a Holyrood parliamentary inquiry, showed narrow leads for &quot;No&quot;.

Support for independence in opinion polling depends upon the format of the question being asked. Polling company Survation have asked Scottish voters the question &quot;Should Scotland remain in the United Kingdom or leave the United Kingdom?&quot;. Since 2018, none of these polls have shown a lead for Remain of less than 10%. The rest of the UK generally supports Scotland remaining a part of the UK. YouGov polling between late 2019 and early 2022 shows that support for Scottish independence is at around 30%, while support for Scotland remaining in the UK is at around 45%.

Following the Supreme Court Judgement of 23 November 2022, determining that the Scottish Government did not have the power to conduct a consultative independence referendum, the first five polls showed majority support for independence in the range of 51% - 56%. In a separate UK-wide poll, for the first time majority support (55%) was expressed across the UK for the right of the Scottish Government to hold an independence referendum.

<text>Windows-1252 or CP-1252 (Windows code page 1252) is a legacy single-byte character encoding that is used by default (as the &quot;ANSI code page&quot;) in Microsoft Windows throughout the Americas, Western Europe, Oceania, and much of Africa.

Initially the same as ISO 8859-1, it began to diverge starting in Windows 2.0 by adding additional characters in the 0x80 to 0x9F (hex) range (the ISO standards reserve this range for C1 control codes). Notable additional characters include curly quotation marks and all printable characters from ISO 8859-15. 

It is the most-used single-byte character encoding in the world. Although almost all websites now use the multi-byte character encoding UTF-8, 1.1% of websites declared ISO 8859-1 which is treated as Windows-1252 by all modern browsers (as required by the HTML5 standard), plus 0.3% declared Windows-1252 directly, for a total of 1.4%. Some countries or languages show a higher usage than the global average, in 2024 Brazil according to website use, use is at 2.9%, and in Germany at 2.5% (these are the sums of ISO-8859-1 and CP-1252 declarations).

==Name==
It is known to Windows by the code page number 1252, and by the IANA-approved name &quot;windows-1252&quot;.

Historically, the phrase &quot;ANSI Code Page&quot; was used in Windows to refer to non-DOS encodings; the intention was that most of these would be ANSI standards such as ISO-8859-1. Even though Windows-1252 was the first and by far most popular code page named so in Microsoft Windows parlance, the code page has never been an ANSI standard. Microsoft explains, &quot;The term ANSI as used to signify Windows code pages is a historical reference, but is nowadays a misnomer that continues to persist in the Windows community.&quot;

LaTeX can input Windows-1252 by using &quot;inputenc.sty&quot; with parameter &quot;ansinew&quot; (and more recently &quot;cp1252&quot;).
IBM uses code page 1252 (CCSID 1252 and euro sign extended CCSID 5348) for Windows-1252.
It is called &quot;WE8MSWIN1252&quot; by Oracle Database.

== History ==

* The first version of the codepage was used in Microsoft Windows 1.0. It matched the ISO-8859-1 standard (including leaving code points 0xD7 and 0xF7 undefined, as they were not in the standard at that time).
* The second version of the codepage was introduced in Microsoft Windows 2.0. In this version, code points 0xD7, 0xF7, 0x91, and 0x92 are defined.
* The third version of the codepage was introduced in Microsoft Windows 3.1. It defined all code points used in the final version except the euro sign and the Z with caron character pair.
* The final version (shown below) was introduced in Microsoft Windows 98.

Starting in the 1990s, many Microsoft products that could produce HTML included Windows-1252-exclusive characters, but marked the encoding as ISO-8859-1, ASCII, or undeclared. Characters exclusive to Windows-1252 would render incorrectly on non-Windows operating systems (often as question marks). In particular, typographers&#x27; quotes—curly variants of the standard straight apostrophes and quotation marks in US-ASCII—were commonly used in files produced in Windows applications such as Microsoft Word due to the smart quotes feature, which can automatically convert straight apostrophes and quotation marks to the curly variants. To fix this, by 2000 most web browsers and e-mail clients treated the charsets ISO-8859-1 and US-ASCII as Windows-1252—this behavior is now required by the HTML5 specification. Undeclared charsets in HTML are also assumed to be Windows-1252.

Although Windows NT supported Unicode and attempted to encourage programs to use it, it only provided the 16-bit code units of UCS-2/UTF-16, despite the existing support for other multibyte character encodings such as Shift-JIS. As many applications preferred to use 8-bit strings, Windows-1252 remained the most popular encoding on Windows. UTF-8 has been supported since Windows 10 so this is gradually changing.

==Codepage layout==
The following table shows Windows-1252. Differences from ISO-8859-1 have the Unicode code point number below the character, based on the Unicode.org mapping of Windows-1252 with &quot;best fit&quot;. A tooltip, generally available only when one points to the immediate right of the character, shows the Unicode code point name and the decimal Alt code.
According to the information on Microsoft&#x27;s and the Unicode Consortium&#x27;s websites, positions 81, 8D, 8F, 90, and 9D are unused; however, the Windows API codice_1 maps these to the corresponding C1 control codes. The &quot;best fit&quot; mapping documents this behavior, too.

==Related encodings==
===OS/2 extensions===
The OS/2 operating system supports an encoding by the name of Code page 1004 (CCSID 1004) or &quot;Windows Extended&quot;. This mostly matches code page 1252, with the exception of certain C0 control characters being replaced by diacritic characters.

===MS-DOS extensions (rare)===
There is a rarely used, but useful, graphics extended code page 1252 where codes 0x00 to 0x1f allow for box drawing as used in applications such as MSDOS Edit and Codeview. One of the applications to use this code page was an Intel Corporation Install/Recovery disk image utility from mid/late 1995. These programs were written for its P6 User Test Program machines (US example). It was used exclusively in its then EMEA region (Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa). In time the programs were changed to use code page 850.

<text>The Adolescents are an American punk rock band formed in Fullerton, California in 1979. Part of the hardcore punk movement in southern California in the early 1980s, they were one of the main punk acts to emerge from Orange County, along with their peers in Agent Orange and Social Distortion. Founding bassist Steve Soto was the sole constant member of the band since its inception until his 2018 death, with singer Tony Reflex being in the group for all but one album.

During the 1980s the band went through several lineup changes, breakups, and reunions, most involving drummer Casey Royer and guitarist brothers Rikk, Frank, and Alfie Agnew. During that decade, they released three albums: &quot;Adolescents&quot; (1981), &quot;Brats in Battalions&quot; (1987), and &quot;Balboa Fun*Zone&quot; (1988, without Reflex), then broke up in April 1989. Most of the members remained active in other musical projects, and a reunion of most of the early members in 2001 resulted in the comeback album &quot;OC Confidential&quot; (2005). Soto and Reflex have been the band&#x27;s only constant members and primary songwriters since then, anchoring lineups that have released five more studio albums: &quot;The Fastest Kid Alive&quot; (2011), &quot;Presumed Insolent&quot; (2013), &quot;La Vendetta...&quot; (2014), &quot;Manifest Density&quot; (2016) and &quot;Cropduster&quot; (2018). On June 27, 2018, Soto died at the age of 54, leaving Reflex as the only original founding member. Brad Logan replaced Soto and the band&#x27;s tenth album, &quot;Russian Spider Dump&quot;, was released in October 2020. The band released their eleventh album, &quot;Caesar Salad Days&quot;, in July 2023.

==History==
===Formation and first recordings: 1980===
Prior to forming the Adolescents, the early band members were part of various formative punk rock groups in Fullerton, California during their teenage years in the late 1970s: Guitarist Rikk Agnew and drummer Casey Royer had played in the Detours and with Agnew&#x27;s younger brother Frank in the early lineup of Social Distortion, while bassist Steve Soto was a founding member of Agent Orange. Soto met Tony Brandenburg at an Agent Orange show in November 1979, and the two, both aged 16, formed a bond, as Soto recalled: &quot;I struck up a conversation with Tony. He was out of control and we became fast friends&quot;. &quot;We would talk about music and the problems we were having in high school and about our weight problems&quot;, Brandenburg later recalled; &quot;We found that we had a lot in common weight-wise—we were polar opposites [Soto was overweight while Brandenburg was tall and thin]—but neither of us could change it. All of our problems on the high school scene were caused by our musical taste and our weight. We were the object of constant ridicule, but what was worse was we couldn&#x27;t get girls&quot;.

Soto thought Brandenburg would make a good singer, and suggested this to Rikk Agnew, who at the time used the stage name General Hospital (after the television show). Soto said: &quot;The General was going to start a new band and I suggested Tony as the singer. He was into the idea but for some reason he ended up reuniting with his old band the Detours instead.&quot; Soto left Agent Orange in late 1979 because bandleader Mike Palm wouldn&#x27;t include Soto&#x27;s songs in the band&#x27;s set, and started a new band in January 1980 with Brandenburg, who used the stage name Tony Cadena. Soto invited Rikk Agnew to join them in the group; he declined but suggested his younger brother Frank. &quot;[Frank] was 15,&quot; recalled Brandenburg; &quot;Steve told Frank that he was putting together a band and I was going to sing. Frank thought I was kinda weird but decided to try it out anyway&quot;. The lineup was completed with guitarist John O&#x27;Donovan and drummer Greg Williams (who went by the stage name Peter Pan), and the new group began practicing, first in Williams&#x27; garage and then at the Detours&#x27; rehearsal space, a modified chicken coop behind a house. &quot;The band made life liveable&quot;, recalled Brandenburg; &quot;High school was still hell, and when a couple of people found out I was in a punk band the ridicule escalated&quot;.

The group began performing as the Adolescents, a name taken from an all-female band from Petaluma who had discarded it. Their first show was in early 1980 at a Boys Club in Yorba Linda, playing with Social Distortion and Agent Orange. &quot;We played six songs, all originals&quot;, said Brandenburg; &quot;This is the irony of punk in Orange County: The only bands that played their own material were beginning punk bands. All the rock bands played cover songs&quot;. The Adolescents also played at Soto&#x27;s high school (El Dorado High School in Placentia) and O&#x27;Donavan&#x27;s (Servite High School in Anaheim), the latter ending chaotically. Brandenburg recalled: &quot;John set up the gig. We played at lunch. We were pelted with garbage and the set ended with me insulting them through the P.A. I kept asking &#x27;Where are your girlfriends?&#x27; and calling them fags. John was suspended and Servite swore there would never be another rock and roll band allowed there&quot;. The band recorded their first demo tape that March in Brandenburg&#x27;s mother&#x27;s garage in Anaheim, and played their first show with Los Angeles bands the following month, opening for the Germs at the Fleetwood in Redondo Beach. They recorded a second demo that May at a studio in Midway City, including the songs &quot;I Hate Children&quot;, &quot;No Friends&quot;, &quot;Who Is Who&quot;, and &quot;Wrecking Crew&quot;. The recordings of &quot;Who Is Who&quot; and &quot;Wrecking Crew&quot; from this tape were released two years later on BYO Records&#x27; inaugural release, the compilation album &quot;Someone Got Their Head Kicked In!&quot;; these were the only recordings released by the Adolescents&#x27; original lineup until 2005&#x27;s &quot;The Complete Demos 1980–1986&quot;.

O&#x27;Donovan and Williams both left the band in June 1980. Soto later recalled &quot;John was more concerned with acting like Johnny Thunders instead of playing like him, and Pan refused to shave his sorry excuse of a teenage mustache. I think Pan&#x27;s girlfriend was supposed to pay for our first demo and then pleaded broke when it came time to pay the man&quot;. Rikk Agnew joined the band, initially as drummer: &quot;Rikk started as our drummer and let me tell you, as a drummer Rikk was second only to Keith Moon&quot;, said Brandenburg; &quot;He didn&#x27;t have much of a drum kit...we had to borrow stuff at gigs, and Rikk kept breaking stuff that belonged to other people (he had this bad habit of kicking the drum kit over). For the sake of survival in an environment of increasingly hostile peer-bands, Rikk switched over to guitar, and Rikk&#x27;s ex-Detours bandmate &#x27;Uncle&#x27; Casey Royer joined on drums&quot;. Rikk and Royer brought with them several songs written for the Detours, including &quot;Amoeba&quot;, &quot;No Way&quot;, &quot;Creatures&quot;, &quot;Rip It Up&quot;, and &quot;Kids of the Black Hole&quot;. &quot;With the addition of Rikk and Casey, we&#x27;d moved to the next level&quot;, recalled Frank Agnew, &quot;They were older and more experienced, so we improved quickly&quot;.

KROQ-FM disc jockey Rodney Bingenheimer played the band&#x27;s second demo tape on his &quot;Rodney on the ROQ&quot; program showcasing local punk acts, giving them the encouragement to record another. They recorded a third demo that July with Chaz Ramirez and Eddie Joseph of local band Eddie and the Subtitles as audio engineers. This demo included &quot;Creatures&quot;, &quot;Amoeba&quot;, &quot;Self Destruct&quot;, and &quot;Do the Eddie&quot;, a joke song written about Joseph. Joseph became the band&#x27;s manager and began shopping their demo to local record labels. &quot;He even got us an advance check that he promptly cashed and left town...Thanks Eddie&quot;, Soto later recalled. The Adolescents continued performing locally and gained in popularity. &quot;After the second party in a row we played turned into a bloodbath/riot (punks and longhairs fighting, then the cops coming and beating everyone up) we quit playing parties&quot;, said Brandenburg. &quot;We had popularity with people in the Hollywood crowd because we&#x27;d stand up to our audience if they got violent, and wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to stop a show if there was a fight. We felt it was inappropriate for punks to be fighting punks&quot;.

Bingenheimer approached the band to record a track for his &quot;Rodney on the ROQ&quot; compilation album (Posh Boy Records, 1980), which featured other Los Angeles and Orange County bands including Agent Orange, Black Flag, and the Circle Jerks. The Adolescents provided a recording of &quot;Amoeba&quot; which became a hit on KROQ that December; Posh Boy owner Robbie Fields presented them with gold singles for the track at a show at the Starwood in West Hollywood in early 1981, and the label later released this version of the song as a single in 1990 and included as a soundtrack for Sony PlayStation Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater video game. The Adolescents also opened for the Germs at the Germs&#x27; final show, on December 3, 1980 at the Starwood.

===First album, &quot;Welcome to Reality&quot; EP, and breakup: 1981–1985===

The band gained the attention of local label Frontier Records, who signed them in January 1981. That March the Adolescents recorded their debut album, &quot;Adolescents&quot;, also known as &quot;The Blue Album&quot; due to its simple blue cover with the band&#x27;s name in red typeface. Engineered and mixed by Thom Wilson and produced by Middle Class bassist Mike Patton, it was recorded, mixed, and mastered in only four days and featured most of the band&#x27;s oeuvre at the time, including songs from their demos and Royer and Rikk Agnew&#x27;s Detours songs. Released the following month, it was one of the first hardcore punk records to be widely distributed throughout the United States, and became one of the best-selling California hardcore albums behind the Dead Kennedys&#x27; &quot;Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables&quot; (1980), selling over 10,000 copies.

Though Rikk Agnew had contributed heavily to the album, tensions between him and the other band members were leading to frequent arguments. Just a few months after the album&#x27;s release, during a performance at the Starwood, he abruptly threw his guitar and walked offstage, quitting the band. &quot;Rikk and I began to have conflicting ideas and Rikk left, citing musical differences&quot;, said Brandenburg. Rikk briefly rejoined the Detours until their breakup in 1982, then joined the gothic rock band Christian Death, playing on their 1982 album &quot;Only Theatre of Pain&quot;, and released a solo album, &quot;All by Myself&quot; (1982). He was replaced in the Adolescents by Pat Smear, formerly of the Germs. The band was planning their first tour, to begin late that summer and last into the fall. &quot;We needed to tour to survive&quot;, recalled Brandenburg. &quot;We had been banned from every club in Hollywood that could hold us—the Starwood, the Roxy, and the Whisky—and a lot of people wouldn&#x27;t go to Pasadena (Perkins Palace) or East L.A. (The Vex) to see us&quot;. Smear, however, did not want to tour, and so left the band in June after only three months to allow them to find a guitar player who would tour. He was replaced by Royer&#x27;s roommate, Steve Roberts, and in July the new lineup recorded a three-song EP, &quot;Welcome to Reality&quot;, produced by Thom Wilson.

Despite the success of the album, the planned release of the EP, and the forthcoming tour, the Adolescents broke up in August 1981. &quot;Oddly enough, we&#x27;d never even made it out of California&quot;, Frank Agnew later reflected. Brandenburg later cited disagreements over the band&#x27;s direction and his personal discomfort with their sudden popularity as reasons for the breakup:

There were big fights between me and most of the band for my refusal to take out the word &quot;fuck&quot; and change it to &quot;suck&quot;. The parents of two members were upset by the profanity — this was our big chance to become junior pop stars; they wanted to tone it down for a wider audience. I looked at groups like Stiff Little Fingers and said &quot;This is where that leads to&quot;. They wanted to sell out; I wasn&#x27;t comfortable with being anybody&#x27;s role model. I was an awkward, nerdy, goofy teen — within two years I was suddenly some spokesman for the angry teenager. I wasn&#x27;t anyone&#x27;s spokesperson; I could barely speak for myself! Everybody hated me, then they all loved me. I didn&#x27;t have enough real friends around to differentiate between what friendship was and what was a passing infatuation. It just wasn&#x27;t comfortable for me.

&quot;Welcome to Reality&quot; was released that October but was not well received. &quot;It went over like a lead balloon and we threw in the towel&quot;, said Brandenburg. After the breakup, Brandenburg formed a new band, the Abandoned, who released one album, &quot;Killed by Faith&quot; (1985). Soto and Frank Agnew joined Los Angeles punk band Legal Weapon, playing on their 1982 album &quot;Death of Innocence&quot;; Agnew remained with them for &quot;Your Weapon&quot;, released later that year, then moved on to Hvy Drt, playing on their 1985 &quot;Hvy Drt&quot; EP. Royer, meanwhile, started D.I., taking on the role of singer. He was joined by Frederic Taccone, Tim Maag, Rikk Agnew, and former Social Distortion drummer Derek O&#x27;Brien for the &quot;D.I.&quot; EP (1983). Agnew then brought in his younger brother, Alfie Agnew, and the two remained in D.I. until 1987, playing on the albums &quot;Ancient Artifacts&quot; (1985) and &quot;Horse Bites Dog Cries&quot; (1986), and the &quot;Team Goon&quot; EP (1987).

===Reunion, &quot;Brats in Battalions&quot;, and &quot;Balboa Fun*Zone&quot;: 1986–1989===
The &quot;Blue Album&quot; lineup of the Adolescents (Brandenburg, now using the stage name Tony Montana; Soto; Royer; and Rikk and Frank Agnew) played a reunion show in April 1986 at Fender&#x27;s Ballroom in Long Beach, California which led to the band re-forming. They played more shows and began working on material for a new album, recording a demo of two new songs, &quot;The Liar&quot; and &quot;Peasant Song&quot;. Frank Agnew left the band after a few months, however, and was replaced by his younger brother Alfie, then Royer left the group that August and was replaced by Sandy Hanson, formerly of the Mechanics. &quot;Casey wanted to keep D.I. going, and I lost interest&quot;, said Frank. &quot;I think that when Casey left, the band lost a major part of its sound&quot;, reflected Brandenburg in 1989. &quot;Casey always played this kinda surf beat. On top of that, he was a major part of the vocal attack. When Casey left, the band...changed&quot;. The new lineup recorded the &quot;Brats in Battalions&quot; album that summer; it included new recordings of all three songs from &quot;Welcome to Reality&quot;, a new version of &quot;Do the Eddie&quot; (retitled &quot;Do the Freddie&quot;), and cover versions of &quot;The House of the Rising Sun&quot; and the Stooges&#x27; &quot;I Got a Right&quot;. After touring through much of the second half of 1986, Alfie Agnew left the band at the end of the year to attend college and was replaced by Dan Colburn.

The lineup of Brandenburg, Soto, Colburn, Hanson, and Rikk Agnew toured for most of 1987, and &quot;Brats in Battalions&quot; was released that August on the group&#x27;s own label, SOS Records. The band also contributed a cover version of the Kinks&#x27; &quot;All Day and All of the Night&quot; to the compilation &quot;Rat Music for Rat People Vol. III&quot; that year. By the end of 1987, however, Brandenburg and Colburn both left the band. Brandenburg stated in 1989, &quot;I was interested in other things (I had joined another band, the Flower Leperds), and the Adolescents touring cut into my school work&quot;. He went on to record three studio albums with the Flower Leperds: &quot;Dirges in the Dark&quot; (1988), &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Closed&quot; (1989), and &quot;Purple Reign&quot; (1990), sometimes using the stage name Tony Adolescent. Soto, Hanson, and Rikk Agnew decided to continue as the Adolescents with Soto and Agnew sharing lead vocal duties, and recruited guitarist Paul Casey, who left after a few months of touring. Frank Agnew rejoined the band and they recorded the album &quot;Balboa Fun*Zone&quot; (1988), released by Triple X Records. The band began working on a follow-up album with the same line-up as &quot;Balboa Fun*Zone&quot;, but eventually broke up in April 1989 before it could be completed. Triple X released the album &quot;Live 1981 &amp; 1986&quot; in 1989, combining recordings from two live performances. The &quot;Blue Album&quot; lineup reunited for a show in December 1989 at the Reseda Country Club, which was recorded and released eight years later as the live album &quot;Return to the Black Hole&quot; (Amsterdamned Records, 1997).

===Post-Adolescents projects: 1990–2000===
Following the Adolescents&#x27; breakup, most of the members remained active in other projects. Soto formed the parody group Manic Hispanic in 1992 with Gabby Gaborno and other Chicano punk musicians, issuing their first album, &quot;The Menudo Incident&quot;, that year. He, Hanson, and Frank Agnew simultaneously started a band called Joyride, but Frank soon left to focus on his family life. He was replaced by guitarist Mike McKnight, who had played additional guitar on the &quot;Brats in Battalions&quot; track &quot;The Liar&quot;, and Joyride continued until 1996, issuing two studio albums, &quot;Johnny Bravo&quot; (1992) and &quot;Another Month of Mondays&quot; (1994). Soto and Hanson subsequently formed 22 Jacks; Hanson left after the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Uncle Bob&quot; (1996). 22 Jacks continued until 2001, issuing two more albums: &quot;Overserved&quot; (1998) and &quot;Going North&quot; (1999).

Royer remained active with D.I., who released &quot;What Good Is Grief to a God?&quot; in 1988 and &quot;Tragedy Again&quot; in 1989. Alfie Agnew rejoined D.I. from 1990 to 1992, joined by ex-Adolescent Dan Colburn on bass guitar; the two performed on the live album &quot;Live at a Dive&quot; (1993). Rikk Agnew, meanwhile, briefly rejoined Christian Death (performing on the live album &quot;Sleepless Nights: Live 1990&quot;) and released another solo album, &quot;Emotional Vomit&quot; (1990), under the name Rikk Agnew&#x27;s Yard Sale; it featured contributions from his brothers Frank and Alfie. His third solo album, &quot;Turtle&quot;, was released in 1992. Following the Flower Leperds, Tony Brandenburg started a new group, Sister Goddamn, who issued two albums, &quot;Portrait in Crayon&quot; (1992) and &quot;Folksongs of the Spanish Inquisition&quot; (1995).

In 1992, the Adolescents&#x27; &quot;Blue Album&quot; members reunited in two projects. Brandenburg and Rikk and Frank Agnew joined other Southern California punk musicians including Bruce Duff (of 45 Grave, Twisted Roots, Sister Goddamn, and several Jeff Dahl projects), Jonny Wickersham, and Warner Young for &quot;Pinups&quot;, an album of cover versions of punk rock songs from the 1970s and early 1980s on which Soto sang backing vocals alongside Dave Naz (of the Chemical People, Down by Law, and the Last) and Rik L. Rik (of F-Word! and the Slaves). Brandenburg (now using the stage name Tony Reflex), Royer, and Rikk Agnew also formed ADZ; the group&#x27;s name was a shortened form of Adolescents. Royer and Agnew both left ADZ after the band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Where Were You?&quot; (1992); both had substance abuse issues. Royer was addicted to heroin, while Agnew abused a variety of drugs and drank alcohol excessively throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, becoming obese in the process. Royer resumed recording with D.I., issuing &quot;State of Shock&quot; in 1994, and continued to perform with various lineups throughout the decade. Rikk Agnew briefly rejoined Christian Death, playing on the live album &quot;Iconologia&quot; (1993). Brandenburg continued ADZ with other members, issuing two more albums during the 1990s: 1995&#x27;s &quot;Piper at the Gates of Downey&quot; (with Frank Agnew playing lead guitar on five tracks) and 1998&#x27;s &quot;Transmissions from Planet Speedball&quot;.

===Reunion and &quot;OC Confidential&quot;: 2001–2005===
The &quot;Blue Album&quot; lineup of Reflex, Soto, Royer, and Rikk and Frank Agnew reunited again in 2001 to play a birthday party for Reflex&#x27;s wife. Over the next few years the band played sporadically, including opening for Bad Religion at a benefit for &quot;Flipside&quot; and a headlining slot at Los Angeles&#x27; Galaxy Theater. During this time the band members remained active in their other projects: Royer released D.I.&#x27;s &quot;Caseyology&quot; in 2002, Reflex did one more studio album with ADZ, 2002&#x27;s &quot;American Steel&quot;, while Soto did two more with Manic Hispanic, &quot;The Recline of Mexican Civilization&quot; (2001) and &quot;Mijo Goes to Jr. College&quot; (2003). Royer left the Adolescents again, going on to release &quot;On the Western Front&quot; with D.I. in 2007. He was replaced by drummer Derek O&#x27;Brien, formerly of Social Distortion, D.I., Agent Orange, and Extra Fancy. Encouraged by the response to their reunion shows, Reflex suggested that the band start writing new material. The Adolescents issued an EP titled &quot;Unwrap and Blow Me!&quot; in 2003, limited to 100 copies and consisting of six new songs: &quot;Hawks and Doves&quot;, &quot;Where the Children Play&quot;, &quot;California Son&quot;, &quot;OC Confidential&quot;, &quot;Pointless Teenage Anthem&quot;, and &quot;Within These Walls&quot;. They performed a show on October 3, 2003 at the House of Blues at Downtown Disney, which was filmed and recorded for Kung Fu Records&#x27; live series &quot;The Show Must Go Off!&quot;. The resulting live album and DVD, titled &quot;Live at the House of Blues&quot;, was released February 24, 2004 and featured songs from &quot;Adolescents&quot; and &quot;Welcome to Reality&quot; along with the new songs &quot;OC Confidential&quot;, &quot;California Son&quot;, &quot;Lockdown America&quot;, &quot;Hawks and Doves&quot;, and &quot;Within These Walls&quot;.

Rikk Agnew, however, continued to drink excessively and was not invested in the reunion. He left the band by the end of 2003, halfway through the recording process for a new album. &quot;None of it made me happy anymore,&quot; he reflected 11 years later, &quot;I loathed it&quot;. He continued to struggle with alcoholism, drug abuse, depression, and morbid obesity over the next several years, despite being taken to drug rehabilitation by some of his former Detours bandmates in 2006. This resulted in a number of serious health problems, and by early 2010 his doctors predicted he would not live beyond three more months. He gave up hard drugs and alcohol, began dieting and exercising, and lost a significant amount of weight. By 2014 he was engaged to former Christian Death member Gitane DeMone, had started his own group, the Rikk Agnew Band, and had reunited with his first band, the Detours, which now included his brother Alfie.
Rikk&#x27;s departure stalled the Adolescents&#x27; recording plans. Soto recorded another album with Manic Hispanic, 2005&#x27;s &quot;Grupo Sexo&quot;. The Adolescents decided to continue as a quartet, re-recording the new songs they had done with Rikk and recording several more for their comeback album, &quot;OC Confidential&quot; (2005), which ultimately took over two years to complete. Prior to its release, they issued &quot;The Complete Demos 1980–1986&quot;, a compilation of all of the early lineups&#x27; demo recordings, released by Frontier Records in March 2005. &quot;OC Confidential&quot; followed that July through Finger Records. For touring in support of the album, the band was joined by Frank Agnew&#x27;s son, Frank Agnew, Jr., on second guitar. Reflex wrapped up ADZ by recording a live album that September, released the following year as &quot;Live Plus Five&quot;.

===Reflex and Soto-led lineups, Soto&#x27;s death, &quot;Russian Spider Dump&quot; and &quot;Caesar Salad Days&quot;: 2006–present===
The Adolescents toured in support of &quot;OC Confidential&quot;, but Frank Agnew left the band in 2006. Rotating through as the band&#x27;s live guitarists over the next few years were Matt Beld, Joe Harrison, and Soto&#x27;s former Joyride bandmate Mike McKnight. O&#x27;Brien left the band in 2008 and was replaced by Armando Del Rio. Reflex and Soto became the band&#x27;s sole constant members and primary songwriters from this point forward, and signed the Adolescents to German label Concrete Jungle Records. A split EP with the band Burning Heads was released in 2009. For the band&#x27;s next album, 2011&#x27;s &quot;The Fastest Kid Alive&quot;, the lineup was Reflex, Soto, Del Rio, McKnight, and Harrison. The band also contributed a cover version of the Runaways&#x27; &quot;School Days&quot; to the tribute album &quot;Take It or Leave It: A Tribute to the Queens of Noise&quot; that year.

Dan Root took Harrison&#x27;s guitar position in 2010, and the Adolescents released the &quot;American Dogs in Europe&quot; EP in conjunction with a European tour. This was followed by the band&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Presumed Insolent&quot; (2013). Del Rio was replaced by Mike Cambra, and McKnight by Leroy Merlin, for 2014&#x27;s &quot;La Vendetta...&quot;, which was given a North American release the following year by Frontier Records. &quot;Hot War&quot;, a split EP with Russian band Svetlanas, followed in 2015, containing one song from &quot;Presumed Insolent&quot; and one from &quot;La Vendetta...&quot; The Adolescents&#x27; released &quot;Manifest Density&quot;, was released July 8, 2016 by Concrete Jungle, with Ian Taylor taking Merlin&#x27;s place as rhythm guitarist.

On June 27, 2018, bassist and founding member Steve Soto died at the age of 54, days after completing an East coast tour with the band. Cause of death is unknown. Tony Reflex released a statement saying &quot;With heavy heart I share the passing of Steve Soto, my friend and bandmate since 1979. I don&#x27;t know what to do. Or to say. Goodbye my brother.&quot; The band released &quot;Cropduster&quot;, their ninth album and final album with Soto, on July 20, 2018. On July 16, 2018, Leftöver Crack&#x27;s Brad Logan joined band following Soto&#x27;s passing. The band released &quot;Russian Spider Dump&quot;, their tenth album and first without Soto and first with Logan, on October 23, 2020. On July 14, 2023, the band released their eleventh studio album, &quot;Caesar Salad Days&quot;.

<doc id="231819" wikidata="Q1506792" url="?curid=231819" title="George Washington-class submarine">
<text>The &quot;George Washington&quot; class was a class of nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines deployed by the United States Navy. &quot;George Washington&quot;, along with the later , , , and classes, comprised the &quot;41 for Freedom&quot; group of submarines that represented the Navy&#x27;s main contribution to the nuclear deterrent force through the late 1980s.

==Development==
In 1957, the US Navy began using submarines in the nuclear deterrent role, when a pair of World War II vintage diesel-electric boats, and , converted to be able to carry a pair of Regulus cruise missiles, began operating deterrent patrols. These two were soon joined by a pair of purpose built diesel boats, and a nuclear powered boat, . However, the use of Regulus in the deterrent role showed a number of limitations; as a cruise missile, it was vulnerable to interception by fighter aircraft, it was limited to subsonic speed, and had a range of less than 1000 km, while the largest of the Regulus armed boats could carry a maximum of five missiles. Additionally, the submarine had to surface to launch a missile, and the missile was guided by a radio signal transmitted from either ship, aircraft or ground station. To overcome these limitations, the Navy turned to ballistic missiles.

The commissioning of &quot;George Washington&quot; on 30 December 1959, the first submarine Polaris launch on 20 July 1960, and her first deterrent patrol November 1960 – January 1961 were the culmination of four years of intense effort. The Navy initially worked on a sea-based variant of the US Army Jupiter intermediate-range ballistic missile, projecting four of the large, liquid-fueled missiles per submarine. Rear Admiral W. F. &quot;Red&quot; Raborn was appointed by Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Arleigh Burke to head a Special Project Office to develop Jupiter for the Navy, beginning in late 1955. However, at the Project Nobska submarine warfare conference in 1956, physicist Edward Teller stated that a compact one-megaton warhead could be produced for the relatively small, solid-fueled Polaris missile, and this prompted the Navy to leave the Jupiter program in December of that year. Soon Admiral Burke concentrated all Navy strategic research on Polaris, still under Admiral Raborn&#x27;s Special Project Office. The problems of submerged launch, designing a submarine for 16 missiles, precise navigation for accurate missile targeting, and numerous others were all solved quickly. By comparison, the contemporary Soviet and ballistic missile submarines only carried three missiles each; the Soviets did not commission an SSBN comparable to the &quot;George Washington&quot; class until 1967 with the introduction of the s.

==Construction==
The Navy ordered a class of nuclear-powered submarines armed with long-range strategic missiles on 31 December 1957, and tasked Electric Boat with converting two existing attack submarine hulls to ballistic missile-carrying boats to quickly create the deterrent force. To accomplish this conversion, Electric Boat persuaded the Navy in January 1958 to slip the launch dates for two fast attack submarines, the just-begun and the not-yet-started . On 12 February 1958, President Dwight D. Eisenhower authorized funding for three ballistic missile submarines.

The &quot;George Washington&quot; class were essentially &quot;Skipjack&quot;-class submarines with a missile compartment, inserted between the ship&#x27;s control/navigation areas and the nuclear reactor compartment. Contrary to some popular accounts, the &quot;Skipjack&quot;s were not literally &quot;cut in half&quot; to become ballistic missile submarines. &quot;Scorpion&quot; had only been under construction for two months at Electric Boat in Groton, Connecticut before she was reordered as . Material and equipment ordered for &quot;Scamp&quot; and &quot;Sculpin&quot; were used to build and at Electric Boat and Mare Island Naval Shipyard, respectively. Newport News Shipbuilding and Portsmouth Naval Shipyard built and without any components ordered for &quot;Skipjack&quot;-class submarines. The original hull classification of the first three units was SSGN(FBM) (Guided Missile Submarine, Fleet Ballistic Missile) which was changed to SSBN on 26 June 1958.

The &quot;George Washington&quot; class carried the Polaris A1 missile on their patrols until 2 June 1964, when she changed out her A1 missiles for Polaris A3s. The last member of this class, &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; swapped out her A1s for A3s on 14 October 1965.

==Withdrawal from strategic role==
By the end of 1979, to make room within the limitations imposed by SALT II for the ballistic missile submarines, and performing shortened patrols of six weeks due to reduced reactor fuel, &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; and &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; offloaded their missiles at the newly established Explosives Handling Wharf at Bangor, Washington. Eventually their missile compartments were completely removed and they were decommissioned by the end of 1982. For the same reason, by 1983 &quot;George Washington&quot;, &quot;Patrick Henry&quot;, and &quot;Robert E. Lee&quot; had their missiles removed and were reclassified as attack submarines nicknamed, &quot;slow attacks&quot;, a role in which they served briefly in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, prior to being decommissioned by early 1985.

&quot;George Washington&quot;″s sail is preserved at the Submarine Force Library and Museum at Groton, Connecticut.

<text>41 for Freedom refers to the US Navy Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM) submarines from the , , , , and es. All of these submarines were commissioned 1959–1967, as the goal was to create a credible, survivable sea-based deterrent as quickly as possible. These submarines were nicknamed &quot;41 for Freedom&quot; once the goal of 41 nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) was established in the early 1960s. The 1972 SALT I Treaty limited the number of American submarine-launched ballistic missile tubes to 656, based on the total missile tubes of the forty-one submarines, in line with the treaty&#x27;s goal of limiting strategic nuclear weapons to the number already existing.

== Overview ==
The United States had deployed nuclear weapons aboard submarines for the purpose of deterrence since 1959, using the SSM-N-8 Regulus cruise missile. However, this was intended to act merely as a stop-gap, as the Regulus was limited both by its size – the greatest number of missiles capable of being taken to sea was five aboard – range and speed, as well as the fact that the submarine was required to surface to launch a missile. The intention was that the main element of the US Navy&#x27;s contribution to the strategic nuclear deterrent be a ballistic missile armed submarine. The &quot;41 for Freedom&quot; nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) were armed with submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) to create a deterrent force against the threat of nuclear war with any foreign power threatening the United States during the Cold War.

The US Navy created a new submarine classification for these boats: SSBN. The first of the &quot;41 for Freedom&quot; submarines to be completed was , which was commissioned on 30 December 1959. The final boat to enter service was , which was commissioned on 1 April 1967. The 41 submarines were ultimately superseded in service by the , the first of which was commissioned in 1981.

, operating as a SEAL platform in her later years, was decommissioned on 2 April 2002, the last boat of the original &quot;41 for Freedom&quot; submarines in commission, and the oldest submarine in the US Navy. Almost 37 years old, she held the record for the longest service lifetime of any nuclear-powered submarine. As of 2014, two boats, and , though decommissioned, continue to serve as moored training ships, attached to Naval Nuclear Power School at Charleston, South Carolina.

<text>A seismometer is an instrument that responds to ground displacement and shaking such as caused by quakes, volcanic eruptions, and explosions. They are usually combined with a timing device and a recording device to form a seismograph. The output of such a device—formerly recorded on paper (see picture) or film, now recorded and processed digitally—is a &quot;seismogram&quot;. Such data is used to locate and characterize earthquakes, and to study the internal structure of Earth.

== Basic principles ==

A simple seismometer, sensitive to up-down motions of the Earth, is like a weight hanging from a spring, both suspended from a frame that moves along with any motion detected. The relative motion between the weight (called the mass) and the frame provides a measurement of the vertical ground motion. A rotating drum is attached to the frame and a pen is attached to the weight, thus recording any ground motion in a seismogram.

Any movement from the ground moves the frame. The mass tends not to move because of its inertia, and by measuring the movement between the frame and the mass, the motion of the ground can be determined.

Early seismometers used optical levers or mechanical linkages to amplify the small motions involved, recording on soot-covered paper or photographic paper. Modern instruments use electronics. In some systems, the mass is held nearly motionless relative to the frame by an electronic negative feedback loop. The motion of the mass relative to the frame is measured, and the feedback loop applies a magnetic or electrostatic force to keep the mass nearly motionless. The voltage needed to produce this force is the output of the seismometer, which is recorded digitally.

In other systems the weight is allowed to move, and its motion produces an electrical charge in a coil attached to the mass which voltage moves through the magnetic field of a magnet attached to the frame. This design is often used in a geophone, which is used in exploration for oil and gas.

Seismic observatories usually have instruments measuring three axes: north-south (y-axis), east–west (x-axis), and vertical (z-axis). If only one axis is measured, it is usually the vertical because it is less noisy and gives better records of some seismic waves.

The foundation of a seismic station is critical. A professional station is sometimes mounted on bedrock. The best mountings may be in deep boreholes, which avoid thermal effects, ground noise and tilting from weather and tides. Other instruments are often mounted in insulated enclosures on small buried piers of unreinforced concrete. Reinforcing rods and aggregates would distort the pier as the temperature changes. A site is always surveyed for ground noise with a temporary installation before pouring the pier and laying conduit. Originally, European seismographs were placed in a particular area after a destructive earthquake. Today, they are spread to provide appropriate coverage (in the case of weak-motion seismology) or concentrated in high-risk regions (strong-motion seismology).

== Nomenclature ==

The word derives from the Greek σεισμός, &quot;seismós&quot;, a shaking or quake, from the verb σείω, &quot;seíō&quot;, to shake; and μέτρον, &quot;métron&quot;, to measure, and was coined by David Milne-Home in 1841, to describe an instrument designed by Scottish physicist James David Forbes.

&quot;Seismograph&quot; is another Greek term from &quot;seismós&quot; and γράφω, &quot;gráphō&quot;, to draw. It is often used to mean &quot;seismometer&quot;, though it is more applicable to the older instruments in which the measuring and recording of ground motion were combined, than to modern systems, in which these functions are separated. Both types provide a continuous record of ground motion; this record distinguishes them from seismoscopes, which merely indicate that motion has occurred, perhaps with some simple measure of how large it was.

The technical discipline concerning such devices is called seismometry, a branch of seismology.

The concept of measuring the &quot;shaking&quot; of something means that the word &quot;seismograph&quot; might be used in a more general sense. For example, a monitoring station that tracks changes in electromagnetic noise affecting amateur radio waves presents an &quot;rf seismograph&quot;. And helioseismology studies the &quot;quakes&quot; on the Sun.

== History ==

The first seismometer was made in China during the 2nd century. It was invented by Zhang Heng, a Chinese mathematician and astronomer. The first Western description of the device comes from the French physicist and priest Jean de Hautefeuille in 1703. The modern seismometer was developed in the 19th century.

Seismometers were placed on the Moon starting in 1969 as part of the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package. In December 2018, a seismometer was deployed on the planet Mars by the &quot;InSight&quot; lander, the first time a seismometer was placed onto the surface of another planet.

=== Ancient era ===

In Ancient Egypt, Amenhotep, son of Hapu invented a precursor of seismometer, a vertical wooden poles connected with wooden gutters on the central axis functioned to fill water into a vessel until full to detect earthquakes.

In AD 132, Zhang Heng of China&#x27;s Han dynasty is said to have invented the first seismoscope (by the definition above), which was called &quot;Houfeng Didong Yi&quot; (translated as, &quot;instrument for measuring the seasonal winds and the movements of the Earth&quot;). The description we have, from the History of the Later Han Dynasty, says that it was a large bronze vessel, about 2 meters in diameter; at eight points around the top were dragon&#x27;s heads holding bronze balls. When there was an earthquake, one of the dragons&#x27; mouths would open and drop its ball into a bronze toad at the base, making a sound and supposedly showing the direction of the earthquake. On at least one occasion, probably at the time of a large earthquake in Gansu in AD 143, the seismoscope indicated an earthquake even though one was not felt. The available text says that inside the vessel was a central column that could move along eight tracks; this is thought to refer to a pendulum, though it is not known exactly how this was linked to a mechanism that would open only one dragon&#x27;s mouth. The first earthquake recorded by this seismoscope was supposedly &quot;somewhere in the east&quot;. Days later, a rider from the east reported this earthquake.

=== Early designs (1259–1839) ===
By the 13th century, seismographic devices existed in the Maragheh observatory (founded 1259) in Persia, though it is unclear whether these were constructed independently or based on the first seismoscope. French physicist and priest Jean de Hautefeuille described a seismoscope in 1703, which used a bowl filled with mercury which would spill into one of eight receivers equally spaced around the bowl, though there is no evidence that he actually constructed the device. A mercury seismoscope was constructed in 1784 or 1785 by Atanasio Cavalli, a copy of which can be found at the University Library in Bologna, and a further mercury seismoscope was constructed by Niccolò Cacciatore in 1818. James Lind also built a seismological tool of unknown design or efficacy (known as an earthquake machine) in the late 1790s.

Pendulum devices were developing at the same time. Neapolitan naturalist Nicola Cirillo set up a network of pendulum earthquake detectors following the 1731 Puglia Earthquake, where the amplitude was detected using a protractor to measure the swinging motion. Benedictine monk Andrea Bina further developed this concept in 1751, having the pendulum create trace marks in sand under the mechanism, providing both magnitude and direction of motion. Neapolitan clockmaker Domenico Salsano produced a similar pendulum which recorded using a paintbrush in 1783, labelling it a &quot;geo-sismometro&quot;, possibly the first use of a similar word to &quot;seismometer&quot;. Naturalist Nicolo Zupo devised an instrument to detect electrical disturbances and earthquakes at the same time (1784).

The first moderately successful device for detecting the time of an earthquake was devised by Ascanio Filomarino in 1796, who improved upon Salsano&#x27;s pendulum instrument, using a pencil to mark, and using a hair attached to the mechanism to inhibit the motion of a clock&#x27;s balance wheel. This meant that the clock would only start once an earthquake took place, allowing determination of the time of incidence.

After an earthquake taking place on October 4, 1834, Luigi Pagani observed that the mercury seismoscope held at Bologna University had completely spilled over, and did not provide useful information. He therefore devised a portable device that used lead shot to detect the direction of an earthquake, where the lead fell into four bins arranged in a circle, to determine the quadrant of earthquake incidence. He completed the instrument in 1841.

=== Early Modern designs (1839–1880) ===
In response to a series of earthquakes near Comrie in Scotland in 1839, a committee was formed in the United Kingdom in order to produce better detection devices for earthquakes. The outcome of this was an inverted pendulum seismometer constructed by James David Forbes, first presented in a report by David Milne-Home in 1842, which recorded the measurements of seismic activity through the use of a pencil placed on paper above the pendulum. The designs provided did not prove effective, according to Milne&#x27;s reports. It was Milne who coined the word &quot;seismometer&quot; in 1841, to describe this instrument. In 1843, the first horizontal pendulum was used in a seismometer, reported by Milne (though it is unclear if he was the original inventor). After these inventions, Robert Mallet published an 1848 paper where he suggested ideas for seismometer design, suggesting that such a device would need to register time, record amplitudes horizontally and vertically, and ascertain direction. His suggested design was funded, and construction was attempted, but his final design did not fulfill his expectations and suffered from the same problems as the Forbes design, being inaccurate and not self-recording.

Karl Kreil constructed a seismometer in Prague between 1848 and 1850, which used a point-suspended rigid cylindrical pendulum covered in paper, drawn upon by a fixed pencil. The cylinder was rotated every 24 hours, providing an approximate time for a given quake.

Luigi Palmieri, influenced by Mallet&#x27;s 1848 paper, invented a seismometer in 1856 that could record the time of an earthquake. This device used metallic pendulums which closed an electric circuit with vibration, which then powered an electromagnet to stop a clock. Palmieri seismometers were widely distributed and used for a long time.

By 1872, a committee in the United Kingdom led by James Bryce expressed their dissatisfaction with the current available seismometers, still using the large 1842 Forbes device located in Comrie Parish Church, and requested a seismometer which was compact, easy to install and easy to read. In 1875 they settled on a large example of the Mallet device, consisting of an array of cylindrical pins of various sizes installed at right angles to each other on a sand bed, where larger earthquakes would knock down larger pins. This device was constructed in &#x27;Earthquake House&#x27; near Comrie, which can be considered the world&#x27;s first purpose-built seismological observatory. As of 2013, no earthquake has been large enough to cause any of the cylinders to fall in either the original device or replicas.

=== The first seismographs (1880-) ===
The first seismographs were invented in the 1870s and 1880s. The first seismograph was produced by Filippo Cecchi in around 1875. A seismoscope would trigger the device to begin recording, and then a recording surface would produce a graphical illustration of the tremors automatically (a seismogram). However, the instrument was not sensitive enough, and the first seismogram produced by the instrument was in 1887, by which time John Milne had already demonstrated his design in Japan.

In 1880, the first horizontal pendulum seismometer was developed by the team of John Milne, James Alfred Ewing and Thomas Gray, who worked as foreign-government advisors in Japan, from 1880 to 1895. Milne, Ewing and Gray, all having been hired by the Meiji Government in the previous five years to assist Japan&#x27;s modernization efforts, founded the Seismological Society of Japan in response to an Earthquake that took place on February 22, 1880, at Yokohama (Yokohama earthquake). Two instruments were constructed by Ewing over the next year, one being a common-pendulum seismometer and the other being the first seismometer using a damped horizontal pendulum. The innovative recording system allowed for a continuous record, the first to do so. The first seismogram was recorded on 3 November 1880 on both of Ewing&#x27;s instruments. Modern seismometers would eventually descend from these designs. Milne has been referred to as the &#x27;Father of modern seismology&#x27; and his seismograph design has been called the first modern seismometer.

This produced the first effective measurement of horizontal motion. Gray would produce the first reliable method for recording vertical motion, which produced the first effective 3-axis recordings.

An early special-purpose seismometer consisted of a large, stationary pendulum, with a stylus on the bottom. As the earth started to move, the heavy mass of the pendulum had the inertia to stay still within the frame. The result is that the stylus scratched a pattern corresponding with the Earth&#x27;s movement. This type of strong-motion seismometer recorded upon a smoked glass (glass with carbon soot). While not sensitive enough to detect distant earthquakes, this instrument could indicate the direction of the pressure waves and thus help find the epicenter of a local quake. Such instruments were useful in the analysis of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Further analysis was performed in the 1980s, using these early recordings, enabling a more precise determination of the initial fault break location in Marin county and its subsequent progression, mostly to the south.

Later, professional suites of instruments for the worldwide standard seismographic network had one set of instruments tuned to oscillate at fifteen seconds, and the other at ninety seconds, each set measuring in three directions. Amateurs or observatories with limited means tuned their smaller, less sensitive instruments to ten seconds.
The basic damped horizontal pendulum seismometer swings like the gate of a fence. A heavy weight is mounted on the point of a long (from 10 cm to several meters) triangle, hinged at its vertical edge. As the ground moves, the weight stays unmoving, swinging the &quot;gate&quot; on the hinge.

The advantage of a horizontal pendulum is that it achieves very low frequencies of oscillation in a compact instrument. The &quot;gate&quot; is slightly tilted, so the weight tends to slowly return to a central position. The pendulum is adjusted (before the damping is installed) to oscillate once per three seconds, or once per thirty seconds. The general-purpose instruments of small stations or amateurs usually oscillate once per ten seconds. A pan of oil is placed under the arm, and a small sheet of metal mounted on the underside of the arm drags in the oil to damp oscillations. The level of oil, position on the arm, and angle and size of sheet is adjusted until the damping is &quot;critical&quot;, that is, almost having oscillation. The hinge is very low friction, often torsion wires, so the only friction is the internal friction of the wire. Small seismographs with low proof masses are placed in a vacuum to reduce disturbances from air currents.

Zollner described torsionally suspended horizontal pendulums as early as 1869, but developed them for gravimetry rather than seismometry.

Early seismometers had an arrangement of levers on jeweled bearings, to scratch smoked glass or paper. Later, mirrors reflected a light beam to a direct-recording plate or roll of photographic paper. Briefly, some designs returned to mechanical movements to save money. In mid-twentieth-century systems, the light was reflected to a pair of differential electronic photosensors called a photomultiplier. The voltage generated in the photomultiplier was used to drive galvanometers which had a small mirror mounted on the axis. The moving reflected light beam would strike the surface of the turning drum, which was covered with photo-sensitive paper. The expense of developing photo-sensitive paper caused many seismic observatories to switch to ink or thermal-sensitive paper.

After World War II, the seismometers developed by Milne, Ewing and Gray were adapted into the widely used Press-Ewing seismometer.

== Modern instruments ==


Modern instruments use electronic sensors, amplifiers, and recording devices. Most are broadband covering a wide range of frequencies. Some seismometers can measure motions with frequencies from 500 Hz to 0.00118 Hz (1/500 = 0.002 seconds per cycle, to 1/0.00118 = 850 seconds per cycle). The mechanical suspension for horizontal instruments remains the garden-gate described above. Vertical instruments use some kind of constant-force suspension, such as the LaCoste suspension. The LaCoste suspension uses a zero-length spring to provide a long period (high sensitivity). Some modern instruments use a &quot;triaxial&quot; or &quot;Galperin&quot; design, in which three identical motion sensors are set at the same angle to the vertical but 120 degrees apart on the horizontal. Vertical and horizontal motions can be computed from the outputs of the three sensors.

Seismometers unavoidably introduce some distortion into the signals they measure, but professionally designed systems have carefully characterized frequency transforms.

Modern sensitivities come in three broad ranges: geophones, 50 to 750 V/m; local geologic seismographs, about 1,500 V/m; and teleseismographs, used for world survey, about 20,000 V/m. Instruments come in three main varieties: short period, long period and broadband. The short and long period measure velocity and are very sensitive, however they &#x27;clip&#x27; the signal or go off-scale for ground motion that is strong enough to be felt by people. A 24-bit analog-to-digital conversion channel is commonplace. Practical devices are linear to roughly one part per million.

Delivered seismometers come with two styles of output: analog and digital. Analog seismographs require analog recording equipment, possibly including an analog-to-digital converter. The output of a digital seismograph can be simply input to a computer. It presents the data in a standard digital format (often &quot;SE2&quot; over Ethernet).

=== Teleseismometers ===
The modern broadband seismograph can record a very broad range of frequencies. It consists of a small &quot;proof mass&quot;, confined by electrical forces, driven by sophisticated electronics. As the earth moves, the electronics attempt to hold the mass steady through a feedback circuit. The amount of force necessary to achieve this is then recorded.

In most designs the electronics holds a mass motionless relative to the frame. This device is called a &quot;force balance accelerometer&quot;. It measures acceleration instead of velocity of ground movement. Basically, the distance between the mass and some part of the frame is measured very precisely, by a linear variable differential transformer. Some instruments use a linear variable differential capacitor.

That measurement is then amplified by electronic amplifiers attached to parts of an electronic negative feedback loop. One of the amplified currents from the negative feedback loop drives a coil very like a loudspeaker. The result is that the mass stays nearly motionless.

Most instruments measure directly the ground motion using the distance sensor. The voltage generated in a sense coil on the mass by the magnet directly measures the instantaneous velocity of the ground. The current to the drive coil provides a sensitive, accurate measurement of the force between the mass and frame, thus measuring directly the ground&#x27;s acceleration (using f=ma where f=force, m=mass, a=acceleration).

One of the continuing problems with sensitive vertical seismographs is the buoyancy of their masses. The uneven changes in pressure caused by wind blowing on an open window can easily change the density of the air in a room enough to cause a vertical seismograph to show spurious signals. Therefore, most professional seismographs are sealed in rigid gas-tight enclosures. For example, this is why a common Streckeisen model has a thick glass base that must be glued to its pier without bubbles in the glue.

It might seem logical to make the heavy magnet serve as a mass, but that subjects the seismograph to errors when the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field moves. This is also why seismograph&#x27;s moving parts are constructed from a material that interacts minimally with magnetic fields. A seismograph is also sensitive to changes in temperature so many instruments are constructed from low expansion materials such as nonmagnetic invar.

The hinges on a seismograph are usually patented, and by the time the patent has expired, the design has been improved. The most successful public domain designs use thin foil hinges in a clamp.

Another issue is that the transfer function of a seismograph must be accurately characterized, so that its frequency response is known. This is often the crucial difference between professional and amateur instruments. Most are characterized on a variable frequency shaking table.

=== Strong-motion seismometers ===
Another type of seismometer is a digital strong-motion seismometer, or accelerograph. The data from such an instrument is essential to understand how an earthquake affects man-made structures, through earthquake engineering. The recordings of such instruments are crucial for the assessment of seismic hazard, through engineering seismology.

A strong-motion seismometer measures acceleration. This can be mathematically integrated later to give velocity and position. Strong-motion seismometers are not as sensitive to ground motions as teleseismic instruments but they stay on scale during the strongest seismic shaking.

Strong motion sensors are used for intensity meter applications.

=== Other forms ===


Accelerographs and geophones are often heavy cylindrical magnets with a spring-mounted coil inside. As the case moves, the coil tends to stay stationary, so the magnetic field cuts the wires, inducing current in the output wires. They receive frequencies from several hundred hertz down to 1 Hz. Some have electronic damping, a low-budget way to get some of the performance of the closed-loop wide-band geologic seismographs.

Strain-beam accelerometers constructed as integrated circuits are too insensitive for geologic seismographs (2002), but are widely used in geophones.

Some other sensitive designs measure the current generated by the flow of a non-corrosive ionic fluid through an electret sponge or a conductive fluid through a magnetic field.

=== Interconnected seismometers ===
Seismometers spaced in a seismic array can also be used to precisely locate, in three dimensions, the source of an earthquake, using the time it takes for seismic waves to propagate away from the hypocenter, the initiating point of fault rupture (See also Earthquake location). Interconnected seismometers are also used, as part of the International Monitoring System to detect underground nuclear test explosions, as well as for Earthquake early warning systems. These seismometers are often used as part of a large scale governmental or scientific project, but some organizations such as the Quake-Catcher Network, can use residential size detectors built into computers to detect earthquakes as well.

In reflection seismology, an array of seismometers image sub-surface features. The data are reduced to images using algorithms similar to tomography. The data reduction methods resemble those of computer-aided tomographic medical imaging X-ray machines (CAT-scans), or imaging sonars.

A worldwide array of seismometers can actually image the interior of the Earth in wave-speed and transmissivity. This type of system uses events such as earthquakes, impact events or nuclear explosions as wave sources. The first efforts at this method used manual data reduction from paper seismograph charts. Modern digital seismograph records are better adapted to direct computer use. With inexpensive seismometer designs and internet access, amateurs and small institutions have even formed a &quot;public seismograph network&quot;.

Seismographic systems used for petroleum or other mineral exploration historically used an explosive and a wireline of geophones unrolled behind a truck. Now most short-range systems use &quot;thumpers&quot; that hit the ground, and some small commercial systems have such good digital signal processing that a few sledgehammer strikes provide enough signal for short-distance refractive surveys. Exotic cross or two-dimensional arrays of geophones are sometimes used to perform three-dimensional reflective imaging of subsurface features. Basic linear refractive geomapping software (once a black art) is available off-the-shelf, running on laptop computers, using strings as small as three geophones. Some systems now come in an 18&quot; (0.5 m) plastic field case with a computer, display and printer in the cover.

Small seismic imaging systems are now sufficiently inexpensive to be used by civil engineers to survey foundation sites, locate bedrock, and find subsurface water.

=== Fiber optic cables as seismometers ===
A new technique for detecting earthquakes has been found, using fiber optic cables.
In 2016 a team of metrologists running frequency metrology experiments in England observed noise with a wave-form resembling the seismic waves generated by earthquakes. This was found to match seismological observations of an {{m|w|6.0|link=y}} earthquake in Italy, ~1400 km away. Further experiments in England, Italy, and with a submarine fiber optic cable to Malta detected additional earthquakes, including one 4,100 km away, and an {{m|l|3.4|link=y}} earthquake 89 km away from the cable.

Seismic waves are detectable because they cause micrometer-scale changes in the length of the cable. As the length changes so does the time it takes a packet of light to traverse to the far end of the cable and back (using a second fiber). Using ultra-stable metrology-grade lasers, these extremely minute shifts of timing (on the order of femtoseconds) appear as phase-changes.

The point of the cable first disturbed by an earthquake&#x27;s p wave (essentially a sound wave in rock) can be determined by sending packets in both directions in the looped pair of optical fibers; the difference in the arrival times of the first pair of perturbed packets indicates the distance along the cable. This point is also the point closest to the earthquake&#x27;s epicenter, which should be on a plane perpendicular to the cable. The difference between the P wave/S wave arrival times provides a distance (under ideal conditions), constraining the epicenter to a circle. A second detection on a non-parallel cable is needed to resolve the ambiguity of the resulting solution. Additional observations constrain the location of the earthquake&#x27;s epicenter, and may resolve the depth.

This technique is expected to be a boon in observing earthquakes, especially the smaller ones, in vast portions of the global ocean where there are no seismometers, and at a cost much cheaper than ocean bottom seismometers.

=== Deep-Learning ===
Researchers at Stanford University created a deep-learning algorithm called UrbanDenoiser which can detect earthquakes, particularly in urban cities. The algorithm filters out the background noise from the seismic noise gathered from busy cities in urban areas to detect earthquakes.

{{further|Seismogram}}

Today, the most common recorder is a computer with an analog-to-digital converter, a disk drive and an internet connection; for amateurs, a PC with a sound card and associated software is adequate. Most systems record continuously, but some record only when a signal is detected,
as shown by a short-term increase in the variation of the signal, compared to its long-term
average (which can vary slowly because of changes in seismic noise){{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}, also known as a STA/LTA trigger.

Prior to the availability of digital processing of seismic data in the late 1970s, the records were done in a few different forms on different types of media. A &quot;Helicorder&quot; drum was a device used to record data into photographic paper or in the form of paper and ink. A &quot;Develocorder&quot; was a machine that record data from up to 20 channels into a 16-mm film. The recorded film can be viewed by a machine. The reading and measuring from these types of media can be done by hand. After the digital processing has been used, the archives of the seismic data were recorded in magnetic tapes. Due to the deterioration of older magnetic tape medias, large number of waveforms from the archives are not recoverable.

<text>Magnolia is a 1999 American drama film written, directed and co-produced by Paul Thomas Anderson. It stars an ensemble cast, including Jeremy Blackman, Tom Cruise, Melinda Dillon, Philip Baker Hall, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Ricky Jay, William H. Macy, Alfred Molina, Julianne Moore, John C. Reilly, Jason Robards (in his final film role) and Melora Walters. The film is an epic mosaic of interrelated characters in search of happiness, forgiveness and meaning in the San Fernando Valley. The script was inspired by the music of Aimee Mann, who contributed several songs to its soundtrack.

The film had a limited theatrical release on December 17, 1999, before expanding wide on January 7, 2000. &quot;Magnolia&quot; received acclaim from critics. It grossed $48.5 million against a $37 million budget. Of the ensemble cast, Cruise was nominated for Best Supporting Actor at the 72nd Academy Awards and won the award in that category at the Golden Globes. It has been regarded by many sources as one of the greatest films of all time.

==Plot==
Los Angeles police officer Jim Kurring investigates a disturbance at a woman&#x27;s apartment, finding a body in a closet. Dixon, a neighborhood boy, unsuccessfully tries to tell him who committed the murder. Jim goes to the apartment of Claudia Wilson, whose neighbors called the police after she argued with her estranged father, Jimmy Gator, and blasted music while snorting cocaine. Seemingly oblivious, Jim asks her on a date.

Jimmy hosts a quiz show called &quot;What Do Kids Know?&quot; and is dying of cancer. The newest child prodigy on the show, Stanley Spector, is hounded by his father Rick for the prize money and demeaned by the adults, who prevent him from using the bathroom during a commercial break. When the show resumes, Stanley wets himself. As the show continues, a drunken Jimmy sickens, ordering the show to go on after he collapses. After Rick berates him, Stanley runs away.

Former &quot;What Do Kids Know?&quot; champion Donnie Smith, whose parents took all his prize money, has been fired from his job due to performance issues and is in love with a male bartender with braces. Donnie wants to get braces himself, thinking the bartender will love him back. He hatches a plan to steal the money from his former boss for the surgery.

The show&#x27;s former producer, Earl Partridge, is also dying of cancer. Earl&#x27;s trophy wife, Linda, collects his prescriptions while he is cared for by a nurse, Phil Parma. Earl asks Phil to find his estranged son, Frank Mackey, a motivational speaker and pickup artist. Frank is interviewed by a journalist who knows Frank took care of his dying mother after Earl left. Frank storms out of the interview, after which Phil tries to contact him.

Linda goes to see Earl&#x27;s lawyer, hoping to change his will. She married Earl for the money, but now loves him and does not want it. The lawyer suggests she renounce the will and decline the money, which would go to Frank. Linda rejects his advice and berates Phil for seeking out Frank, but later apologizes. She drives to a vacant parking lot and attempts suicide by drug overdose. Dixon finds Linda near death in the car, takes the money from her purse, and calls an ambulance.

Jim loses his gun while trying to catch a suspect. When he meets Claudia, they promise to be honest with each other, so he confesses his ineptitude as a cop and admits he has not been on a date since he divorced three years earlier. Claudia says he will hate her because of her problems, but Jim assures her that her past does not matter. They kiss, but she leaves him.

Jimmy goes home to his wife, Rose, and confesses that he cheated on her. She asks why Claudia does not talk to him, and Jimmy admits that Claudia believes he molested her. Rose demands to know if it is true, but Jimmy says he cannot remember. Rose leaves him. Elsewhere, Donnie steals the money, but when he decides to return it, he cannot get back inside the office. While Donnie climbs a utility pole to the roof to try to return the money, Jim sees him and feels compelled to investigate.

Suddenly, frogs begin falling from the sky. One of them hits Donnie, and he falls from the pole and smashes his teeth. As Jimmy is about to kill himself, frogs fall through his skylight, causing him to shoot the television and cause a house fire. Rose crashes her car near Claudia&#x27;s apartment but makes it inside and reconciles with her daughter. Earl is awakened and sees Frank beside him before dying. Linda&#x27;s ambulance crashes near the hospital. Donnie is rescued by Jim, and Jim&#x27;s lost gun falls from the sky.

Jim helps Donnie return the money. Frank goes to the hospital to be with Linda, who will recover. Stanley tells his father, Rick, that he needs to be nice to him, but Rick tells him to go to bed. Jim goes to see Claudia, telling her he wants to make things work between them. As Jim is explaining this, Claudia smiles.

==Production==
===Development===
Paul Thomas Anderson started to get ideas for &quot;Magnolia&quot; during the long editing period of &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; (1997). As he got closer to finishing the film, he started writing down material for his new project. After the critical and financial success of &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;, New Line Cinema, who backed that film, told Anderson that he could do whatever he wanted and Anderson realized that, &quot;I was in a position I will never ever be in again.&quot; Michael De Luca, then head of production at New Line Cinema, made the deal for &quot;Magnolia&quot;, granting Anderson final cut without hearing an idea for the film. Originally, Anderson had wanted to make a film that was &quot;intimate and small-scale,&quot; something that he could shoot in 30 days. He had the title of &quot;Magnolia&quot; in his head before he wrote the script.

As he started writing, the script &quot;kept blossoming&quot; and he realized that there were many actors he wanted to write for and then decided to put &quot;an epic spin on topics that don&#x27;t necessarily get the epic treatment&quot;. He wanted to &quot;make the epic, the all-time great San Fernando Valley movie&quot;. Anderson started with lists of images, words and ideas that &quot;start resolving themselves into sequences and shots and dialogue,&quot; actors, and music. The first image he had for the film was the smiling face of actress Melora Walters. The next image that came to him was of Philip Baker Hall as her father. Anderson imagined Hall walking up the steps of Walters&#x27; apartment and having an intense confrontation with her. Anderson also did research on the magnolia tree and discovered a concept that eating the tree&#x27;s bark helped cure cancer.

Before Anderson became a filmmaker, one of the jobs he had was as an assistant for a television game show, &quot;Quiz Kid Challenge&quot;, an experience he incorporated into the script for &quot;Magnolia&quot;. He also claimed in interviews that the film is structured somewhat like &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; by The Beatles, and &quot;it kind of builds up, note by note, then drops or recedes, then builds again&quot;.

===Screenplay===
By the time he started writing the script, Anderson was listening to the music of his friend Aimee Mann. He used her first two solo albums and demo tracks for her upcoming third album, &quot;Bachelor No. 2 or, the Last Remains of the Dodo&quot;, as a basis and inspiration; he said he &quot;sat down to write an adaptation of Aimee Mann songs&quot;. In particular, Mann&#x27;s song &quot;Deathly&quot; inspired the character of Claudia. Claudia uses part of the lyric as dialogue in the film (&quot;Now that I&#x27;ve met you / Would you object to / Never seeing each other again&quot;). The film also features a sequence in which the characters sing along to Mann&#x27;s song &quot;Wise Up&quot;.

The character of Jim Kurring originated in 1998, when John C. Reilly grew a moustache out of interest and started putting together an unintelligent cop character. He and Anderson did a few parodies of &quot;COPS&quot; with Anderson chasing Reilly around the streets with a video camera. Jennifer Jason Leigh made an appearance in one of these videos. Some of Kurring&#x27;s dialogue came from these sessions. This time around, Reilly wanted to do something different and told Anderson that he was &quot;always cast as these heavies or these semi-retarded child men. Can&#x27;t you give me something I can relate to, like falling in love with a girl?&quot; Anderson also wanted to make Reilly a romantic lead because it was something different that the actor had not done before.

For Philip Seymour Hoffman, Anderson wanted him to play a &quot;really simple, uncomplicated, caring character&quot;. Hoffman described his character as someone who &quot;really takes pride in the fact that every day he&#x27;s dealing with life and death circumstances&quot;. With Julianne Moore in mind, Anderson wrote a role for her to play a crazed character using many pharmaceuticals. According to Moore, &quot;Linda doesn&#x27;t know who she is or what she&#x27;s feeling and can only try to explain it in the most vulgar terms possible&quot;. Anderson said that Linda&#x27;s story was inspired by his own father&#x27;s wife. For William H. Macy, Anderson felt that Macy was scared of big, emotional parts and wrote &quot;a big tearful, emotional part&quot; for him.

While convincing Philip Baker Hall to do the film by explaining the significance of the rain of frogs, Hall told him a story about when he was in the mountains of Italy and got caught in bad weather—a mix of rain, snow and tiny frogs. Hall had to pull off the road until the storm passed. According to an interview, Hall said that he based the character of Jimmy Gator on real-life TV personalities such as Bob Barker and Arthur Godfrey. The rain of frogs was inspired by the works of Charles Fort, and Anderson claims that he was unaware that it was also a reference in The Bible when he first wrote the sequence. At the time Anderson came across the notion of a rain of frogs, he was &quot;going through a weird, personal time&quot;, and he started to understand &quot;why people turn to religion in times of trouble, and maybe my form of finding religion was reading about rains of frogs and realizing that makes sense to me somehow&quot;.

===Casting===
Tom Cruise was a fan of Anderson&#x27;s previous film, &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;, and contacted Anderson while he was working on Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; (1999). Anderson met with Cruise on the set of Kubrick&#x27;s film and Cruise told him to keep him in mind for his next film. After Anderson finished the script, he sent Cruise a copy and the next day, Cruise called him. Cruise was interested but nervous about the role. Anderson met with Cruise along with De Luca who helped convince Cruise to do the film. Frank T.J. Mackey, the character that Cruise would play in the film, was based in part on an audio-recording done in an engineering class taught by a friend that was given to Anderson. It consisted of two men, &quot;talking all this trash&quot; about women and quoting a man named Ross Jeffries, who was teaching a new version of the Eric Weber course, &quot;How to Pick Up Women,&quot; but utilizing hypnotism and subliminal language techniques. Anderson transcribed the tape and did a reading with Reilly and Chris Penn. Anderson then incorporated this dialogue and his research on Jeffries and other self-help gurus into Mackey and his sex seminar. Anderson felt that Cruise was drawn to the role because he had just finished making &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;, playing a repressed character, and was able to then play a character that was &quot;outlandish and bigger-than-life&quot;. Anderson filmed a full-length infomercial with Cruise and even bought time on late night TV to play it on.

Anderson wrote the role of Earl Partridge for Jason Robards, but Robards could not do it due to a staph infection. After George C. Scott declined the role, Robards managed to take it. He said of his character, &quot;It was sort of prophetic that I be asked to play a guy going out in life. It was just so right for me to do this and bring what I know to it&quot;. According to Hall, much of the material with Partridge was based on Anderson watching his father die of cancer. Anderson wanted Burt Reynolds to star in the film after working on &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;, but Reynolds declined it.

===Filming===
Filming began on January 12, 1999, and was initially scheduled to be 79 days, but ending up lasting until June 24, 1999, making a total of 90 filming days plus 10 days of second unit filming.

Anderson is known for the use of long takes in his films that move along considerable distances with complex camera movements and transitions with actors and the sets. Of the long takes in &quot;Magnolia&quot;, the most notable may be the 2 minutes 15 seconds where character Stanley Spector arrives at the studio for a taping of &quot;What Do Kids Know?&quot;, the camera seamlessly moving through multiple rooms and hallways and transitioning to follow different characters throughout the single take.

For the look of the film, the production designers analyzed films with close, tight and warm color palettes and applied it to &quot;Magnolia&quot;. They also wanted to evoke the colors of the magnolia flower: greens, browns and off-whites. For the section of the prologue that is set in 1911, Anderson used a hand-cranked Pathé camera that would have been used at the time. Some of the actors were nervous about their scene singing the lyrics to Mann&#x27;s &quot;Wise Up&quot;, so Anderson asked Moore to go first to help set the pace which everyone else followed.

Anderson and New Line Cinema reportedly had intense arguments about how to market &quot;Magnolia&quot;. He felt that the studio did not do a decent enough job on &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; and did not like the studio&#x27;s poster or trailer for &quot;Magnolia&quot;. Anderson ended up designing his own poster, cut together a trailer himself, wrote the liner notes for the soundtrack album, and pushed to avoid hyping Cruise&#x27;s presence in the film in favor of the ensemble cast. Even though Anderson ultimately got his way, he realized that he had to &quot;learn to fight without being a jerk. I was a bit of a baby. At the first moment of conflict, I behaved in a slightly adolescent knee-jerk way. I just screamed.&quot;

==Music and soundtracks==

Anderson met Aimee Mann in 1996 when he asked her husband, Michael Penn, to write the score and songs for his film, &quot;Hard Eight&quot;. Mann had songs on soundtracks before but never &quot;in such an integral way&quot;, she said in an interview. She gave Anderson rough mixes of songs and found that they both wrote about the same kinds of characters. He encouraged her to write songs for the film by sending her a copy of the script. Anderson said that &quot;Simon and Garfunkel is to &quot;The Graduate&quot; as Aimee Mann is to &quot;Magnolia&quot;&quot;.

Two songs were written expressly for the film: &quot;You Do&quot;, which was based on a character later cut from the film, and &quot;Save Me&quot;, which closes the film; the latter was nominated in the 2000 Academy Awards and Golden Globes and in the 2001 Grammys. Most of the remaining seven Mann songs were demos and works in progress; &quot;Wise Up&quot;, which is at the center of a sequence in which all of the characters sing the song, was originally written for the 1996 film &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot;. At the time, Mann&#x27;s record label had refused to release her songs on an album. The song that plays at the opening of the film is Mann&#x27;s cover of &quot;One&quot; by Harry Nilsson. Mann&#x27;s track &quot;Momentum&quot; is used as the loud playing music in Claudia&#x27;s apartment scene when Officer Jim arrives and was also featured in the trailer for the film.

The soundtrack album, released in December 1999 on Reprise Records, features the Mann songs, as well as a section of Jon Brion&#x27;s score and tracks by Supertramp and Gabrielle that were used in the film. Reprise released a full score album in March 2000.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Magnolia&quot; initially opened in a limited release on December 17, 1999, in seven theaters grossing $193,604. The film was given a wide release on January 7, 2000, in 1,034 theaters grossing $5.7 million on its opening weekend. It has grossed $22.5million in the United States and Canada, and $26.0million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $48.5million, against a budget of $37million.

=== Critical response ===

 Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C-&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

&quot;USA Today&quot; gave the film three and a half stars out of four and called it &quot;the most imperfect of the year&#x27;s best movies&quot;. Roger Ebert from the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; awarded the film four stars out of four, praising it in both of his reviews from 2000 and 2008, and as his second favorite film of 1999, behind &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot;. He said in the first review, &quot;&quot;Magnolia&quot; is the kind of film I instinctively respond to. Leave logic at the door. Do not expect subdued taste and restraint, but instead a kind of operatic ecstasy&quot;. After rewatching it in 2008, he added the film to his &#x27;Great Movies&#x27; list. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a &quot;B+&quot; rating, praising Cruise&#x27;s performance: &quot;It&#x27;s with Cruise as Frank T.J. Mackey, a slick televangelist of penis power, that the filmmaker scores his biggest success, as the actor exorcises the uptight fastidiousness of &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; ... Like John Travolta in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, this cautiously packaged movie star is liberated by risky business&quot;. &quot;The Independent&quot; said that the film was &quot;limitless. And yet some things do feel incomplete, brushed-upon, tangential. &quot;Magnolia&quot; does not have the last word on anything. But is superb&quot;. Kenneth Turan, in his review for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, praised Tom Cruise&#x27;s performance: &quot;Mackey gives Cruise the chance to cut loose by doing amusing riffs on his charismatic superstar image. It&#x27;s great fun, expertly written and performed, and all the more enjoyable because the self-parody element is unexpected&quot;. In his review for &quot;The New York Observer&quot;, Andrew Sarris wrote, &quot;In the case of &quot;Magnolia&quot;, I think Mr. Anderson has taken us to the water&#x27;s edge without plunging in. I admire his ambition and his very eloquent camera movements, but if I may garble something Lenin once said one last time, &#x27;You can&#x27;t make an omelet without breaking some eggs&#x27;.&quot;

In her review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin wrote, &quot;But when that group sing-along arrives, &quot;Magnolia&quot; begins to self-destruct spectacularly. It&#x27;s astonishing to see a film begin this brilliantly only to torpedo itself in its final hour,&quot; but went on to say that the film &quot;was saved from its worst, most reductive ideas by the intimacy of the performances and the deeply felt distress signals given off by the cast&quot;. Philip French, in his review for &quot;The Observer&quot;, wrote, &quot;But is the joyless universe he (Anderson) presents any more convincing than the Pollyanna optimism of traditional sitcoms? These lives are somehow too stunted and pathetic to achieve the level of tragedy&quot;. The &quot;Time&quot; critic Richard Schickel wrote: &quot;The result is a hard-striving, convoluted movie, which never quite becomes the smoothly reciprocating engine Anderson (who did &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;) would like it to be.&quot;

In an interview, Ingmar Bergman mentioned &quot;Magnolia&quot; as an example of the &quot;strength of American cinema&quot;. Roger Ebert included the work in his &quot;Great Movies&quot; list in November 2008, saying, &quot;As an act of filmmaking, it draws us in and doesn&#x27;t let go.&quot; &quot;Total Film&quot; magazine placed it at number 4 in their list of 50 Best Movies in Total Film&#x27;s lifetime. In 2008, it was named the 89th greatest movie of all time by &quot;Empire&quot; magazine in its issue of &quot;The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time&quot;. It received eight votes – five from critics and three from directors – in the British Film Institute&#x27;s 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; polls.

Following the film&#x27;s release, Anderson said: &quot;I really feel ... That &quot;Magnolia&quot; is, for better or worse, the best movie I&#x27;ll ever make.&quot; Later he came to consider it overlong; when asked in an interview what he would tell himself to do if he could go back to when he shot the film, his response was &quot;Chill The Fuck Out and Cut Twenty Minutes.&quot;

===Accolades===
* In 2004, the American Film Institute nominated the song &quot;Save Me&quot; from this film for AFI&#x27;s 100 Years ... 100 Songs.

==Themes==
Essays have been written on the themes in &quot;Magnolia&quot;, such as regret; loneliness; the cost of failed relationships as a result of parents, particularly fathers, who have failed their children; and cruelty to children and its lasting effect (as demonstrated by the sexual assault perpetrated on Claudia by Jimmy).

===Raining frogs and Exodus (Bible) reference===

At the end of the film, frogs rain from the sky. Throughout the film, there are references to the Book of Exodus 8:2 &quot;And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs.&quot;

The film has an underlying theme of unexplained events, taken from the 1920s and 1930s works of Charles Fort. Fortean author Loren Coleman&#x27;s 2001 book &quot;Mysterious America: The Revised Edition&quot; includes a chapter entitled &quot;The Teleporting Animals and &quot;Magnolia&quot;&quot;, addressing the film. The chapter discusses how one of Fort&#x27;s books is visible on the table in the library and the film&#x27;s end credit thanking Charles Fort.

The only character who seems to be unsurprised by the falling frogs is Stanley. He calmly observes the event, saying, &quot;This happens. This is something that happens.&quot; This has led to the speculation that Stanley is a prophet, allegorically akin to Moses, and that the &quot;slavery&quot; to which the film alludes is the exploitation of children by adults. These &quot;father issues&quot; persist throughout the film, as seen in the abuse and neglect of Claudia, Frank, Donnie, Stanley, and Dixon.

==Home media==
The DVD release includes a lengthy behind-the-scenes documentary, &quot;That Moment&quot;.

<text>The C preprocessor (CPP) is a text file processor that is used with C, C++ and other programming tools. The preprocessor provides for file inclusion (often header files), macro expansion, conditional compilation, and line control. Although named in association with C and used with C, the preprocessor capabilities are not inherently tied to the C language. It can and is used to process other kinds of files.

C, C++, and Objective-C compilers provide a preprocessor capability, as it is required by the definition of each language. Some compilers provide extensions and deviations from the target language standard. Some provide options to control standards compliance. For instance, the GNU C preprocessor can be made more standards compliant by supplying certain command-line flags.

The C# programming language also allows for directives, even though they cannot be used for creating macros. C# seldom requires the use of the directives, for example code inclusion is handled similarly to Java - the keyword codice_1 is used rather than an codice_2 directive.

Features of the preprocessor are encoded in source code as directives that start with codice_3.

Although C++ source files are often named with a codice_4 extension, that is an abbreviation for &quot;C plus plus&quot;; not C preprocessor.

== History ==
The preprocessor was introduced to C around 1973 at the urging of Alan Snyder and also in recognition of the usefulness of the file inclusion mechanisms available in BCPL and PL/I. The first version offered file inclusion via codice_2 and parameterless string replacement macros via codice_6. It was extended shortly after, firstly by Mike Lesk and then by John Reiser, to add arguments to macros and to support conditional compilation.

The C preprocessor was part of a long macro-language tradition at Bell Labs, which was started by Douglas Eastwood and Douglas McIlroy in 1959.

== Phases ==
Preprocessing is defined by the first four (of eight) &quot;phases of translation&quot; specified in the C Standard.

# Trigraph replacement: The preprocessor replaces trigraph sequences with the characters they represent. This phase will be removed in C23 following the steps of C++17.
# Line splicing: Physical source lines that are continued with escaped newline sequences are &quot;spliced&quot; to form logical lines.
# Tokenization: The preprocessor breaks the result into &quot;preprocessing tokens&quot; and whitespace. It replaces comments with whitespace.
# Macro expansion and directive handling: Preprocessing directive lines, including file inclusion and conditional compilation, are executed. The preprocessor simultaneously expands macros and, since the 1999 version of the C standard, handles codice_7 operators.

== Features ==

=== File inclusion ===
To include the content of one file into another, the preprocessor replaces a line that starts with codice_2 with the content of the file specified after the directive. The inclusion may be logical in the sense that the resulting content may not be stored on disk and certainly is not overwritten to the source file. 

In the following example code, the preprocessor replaces the line codice_9 with the content of the standard library header file named &#x27;stdio.h&#x27; in which the function codice_10 and other symbols are declared.
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(void) {
 printf(&quot;Hello, World!\n&quot;);
 return 0;


In this case, the file name is enclosed in angle brackets to denote that it is a system file. For a file in the codebase being built, double-quotes are used instead. The preprocessor may use a different search algorithm to find the file based on this distinction.

For C, a header file is usually named with a codice_11 extension. In C++, the convension for file extension varies with common extensions codice_11 and codice_13. But the preprocessor includes a file regardless of the extension. In fact, sometimes code includes codice_14 or codice_4 files.

To prevent including the same file multiple times which often leads to a compiler error, a header file typically contains an include guard or if supported by the preprocessor codice_16 to prevent multiple inclusion.

=== Conditional compilation ===
Conditional compilation is supported via the if-else core directives codice_17, codice_18, codice_19, and codice_20 and with contraction directives codice_21 and codice_22 which stand for and , respectively. In the following example code, the codice_10 call is only included for compilation if codice_24 is defined.
#ifdef VERBOSE
 printf(&quot;trace message&quot;);
#endif
The following demonstrates more complex logic:
#if !(defined __LP64__ || defined __LLP64__) || defined _WIN32 &amp;&amp; !defined _WIN64
 // code for a 32-bit system
#else
 // code for a 64-bit system
#endif
=== Macro string replacement ===

;Object-like
A macro specifies how to replace text in the source code with other text. An &quot;object-like&quot; macro defines a token that the preprocessor replaces with other text. It does not include parameter syntax and therefore cannot support parameterization. The following macro definition associates the text &quot;1 / 12&quot; with the token &quot;VALUE&quot;:
#define VALUE 1 / 12
;Function-like
A &quot;function-like&quot; macro supports parameters; although the parameter list can be empty. The following macro definition associates the expression &quot;(A + B)&quot; with the token &quot;ADD&quot; that has parameters &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;.
#define ADD(A, B) (A + B)
A function-like macro declaration cannot have whitespace between the token and the first, opening parenthesis. If whitespace is present, the macro is interpreted as object-like with everything starting at the first parenthesis included in the replacement text.

;Expansion
The preprocessor replaces each token of the code that matches a macro token with the associated replacement text in what is known as &quot;macro expansion&quot;. Note that text of string literals and comments is not parsed as tokens and is therefore ignored for macro expansion. For a function-like macro, the macro parameters are also replaced with the values specified in the macro reference. For example, codice_25 expands to codice_26.

;Variadic
A variadic macro (introduced with C99) accepts a varying number of arguments which is particularly useful when wrapping functions that accept a variable number of parameters, such as codice_27.

;Order of expansion
&quot;Function-like&quot; macro expansion occurs in the following stages:

# Stringification operations are replaced with the textual representation of their argument&#x27;s replacement list (without performing expansion).
# Parameters are replaced with their replacement list (without performing expansion).
# Concatenation operations are replaced with the concatenated result of the two operands (without expanding the resulting token).
# Tokens originating from parameters are expanded.
# The resulting tokens are expanded as normal.

This may produce surprising results:
#define HE HI
#define LLO _THERE
#define HELLO &quot;HI THERE&quot;
#define CAT(a,b) a##b
#define XCAT(a,b) CAT(a,b)
#define CALL(fn) fn(HE,LLO)
CAT(HE, LLO) // &quot;HI THERE&quot;, because concatenation occurs before normal expansion
XCAT(HE, LLO) // HI_THERE, because the tokens originating from parameters (&quot;HE&quot; and &quot;LLO&quot;) are expanded first
CALL(CAT) // &quot;HI THERE&quot;, because this evaluates to CAT(a,b)
===Undefine macro===

A macro definition can be removed from the preprocessor context via codice_28 such that subsequent reference to the macro token will not expand. For example:
#undef VALUE
===Predefined macros===

The preprocessor provides some macro definitions automatically. The C standard specifies that codice_29 expands to the name of the file being processed and codice_30 expands to the number of the line that contains the directive. The following macro, codice_31, formats and prints a message with the file name and line number.
#define DEBUGPRINT(_fmt, ...) printf(&quot;[%s:%d]: &quot; _fmt, __FILE__, __LINE__, __VA_ARGS__)
For the example code below that is on line 30 of file codice_32 and for count 123, the output is: codice_33.
DEBUGPRINT(&quot;count=%d\n&quot;, count);
The first C Standard specified that codice_34 expand to &quot;1&quot; if the implementation conforms to the ISO standard and &quot;0&quot; otherwise and that codice_35 expand to a numeric literal specifying the version of the standard supported by the implementation. Standard C++ compilers support the codice_36 macro. Compilers running in non-standard mode must not set these macros or must define others to signal the differences.

Other standard macros include codice_37, the current date, and codice_38, the current time.

The second edition of the C Standard, C99, added support for codice_39, which contains the name of the function definition within which it is contained, but because the preprocessor is to the grammar of C, this must be done in the compiler itself using a variable local to the function.

One little-known usage pattern of the C preprocessor is known as X-Macros. An X-Macro is a header file. Commonly, these use the extension codice_40 instead of the traditional codice_11 . This file contains a list of similar macro calls, which can be referred to as &quot;component macros.&quot; The include file is then referenced repeatedly.

Many compilers define additional, non-standard macros. A common reference for these macros is the Pre-defined C/C++ Compiler Macros project, which lists &quot;various pre-defined compiler macros that can be used to identify standards, compilers, operating systems, hardware architectures, and even basic run-time libraries at compile-time.&quot;

Most compilers targeting Microsoft Windows implicitly define codice_42. This allows code, including preprocessor commands, to compile only when targeting Windows systems. A few compilers define codice_43 instead. For such compilers that do not implicitly define the codice_42 macro, it can be specified on the compiler&#x27;s command line, using codice_45.
#ifdef __unix__ /* __unix__ is usually defined by compilers targeting Unix systems */
# include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#elif defined _WIN32 /* _WIN32 is usually defined by compilers targeting 32 or 64 bit Windows systems */
# include &lt;windows.h&gt;
#endif
The example code tests if a macro codice_46 is defined. If it is, the file codice_47 is then included. Otherwise, it tests if a macro codice_42 is defined instead. If it is, the file codice_49 is then included.

===Line control===
The values of the predefined macros codice_29 and codice_30 can be set for a subsequent line via the codice_52 directive. In the code below, codice_30 expands to 314 and codice_29 to &quot;pi.c&quot;.
#line 314 &quot;pi.c&quot;
printf(&quot;line=%d file=%s\n&quot;, __LINE__, __FILE__);
===Token stringification===
The stringification operator (a.k.a. stringizing operator), denoted by codice_3 converts a token into a string literal, escaping any quotes or backslashes as needed. For definition:
#define str(s) #s
codice_56 expands to codice_57 and codice_58 expands to codice_59.

If stringification of the expansion of a macro argument is desired, two levels of macros must be used. For definition:
#define xstr(s) str(s)
#define str(s) #s
#define foo 4
codice_60 expands to &quot;foo&quot; and codice_61 expands to &quot;4&quot;.

A macro argument cannot be combined with additional text and then stringified. However, a series of adjacent string literals and stringified arguments, also string literals, are concatenated by the C compiler.

===Token concatenation===
The token pasting operator, denoted by codice_62, concatenates two tokens into one. For definition:
#define DECLARE_STRUCT_TYPE(name) typedef struct name##_s name##_t
codice_63 expands to codice_64.

=== Abort ===
Processing can be aborted via the codice_65 directive. For example:
#if RUBY_VERSION == 190
#error Ruby version 1.9.0 is not supported
#endif
=== Binary resource inclusion ===
C23 and C++26 introduce the codice_66 directive for binary resource inclusion which allows including the content of a binary file into a source even though it&#x27;s not valid C code.
This allows binary resources (like images) to be included into a program without requiring processing by external tools like codice_67 and without the use of string literals which have a length limit on MSVC. Similarly to codice_67 the directive is replaced by a comma separated list of integers corresponding to the data of the specified resource. More precisely, if an array of type is initialized using an codice_66 directive, the result is the same as-if the resource was written to the array using codice_70 (unless a parameter changes the embed element width to something other than codice_71). Apart from the convenience, codice_66 is also easier for compilers to handle, since they are allowed to skip expanding the directive to its full form due to the as-if rule.

The file to embed is specified the same as for codice_2 either with brackets or double quotes. The directive also allows certain parameters to be passed to it to customize its behavior. The C standard defines some parameters and implementations may define additional. The codice_74 parameter is used to limit the width of the included data. It is mostly intended to be used with &quot;infinite&quot; files like urandom. The codice_75 and codice_76 parameters allow for specifying a prefix and suffix to the embedded data. Finally, the codice_77 parameter replaces the entire directive if the resource is empty. All standard parameters can be surrounded by double underscores, just like standard attributes on C23, for example codice_78 is interchangeable with codice_75 . Implementation-defined parameters use a form similar to attribute syntax (e.g., codice_80) but without the square brackets. While all standard parameters require an argument to be passed to them (e.g., limit requires a width), this is generally optional and even the set of parentheses can be omitted if an argument is not required, which might be the case for some implementation-defined parameters.

==Non-standard features ==

;Pragma
The codice_81 directive is defined by standard languages, but with little or no requirements for syntax after its name so that compilers are free to define subsequent syntax and associated behavior. For instance, a pragma is often used to allow suppression of error messages, manage heap and stack debugging and so on.

C99 introduced a few standard pragmas, taking the form codice_82, which are used to control the floating-point implementation. The alternative, macro-like form was also added.

;Trigraphs
Many implementations do not support trigraphs or do not replace them by default.

;Warning
Many implementations (such as the C compilers by GNU, Intel, Microsoft and IBM) provide a non-standard directive to print a message without aborting, typically to warn about the use of deprecated functionality. For example:
// GNU, Intel and IBM
#warning &quot;Do not use ABC, which is deprecated. Use XYZ instead.&quot;

// Microsoft
#pragma message(&quot;Do not use ABC, which is deprecated. Use XYZ instead.&quot;)
C23 and C++23 standardize .

;Assertion
Some Unix preprocessors provided an assertion feature which has little similarity to standard library assertions.

;Include next
GCC provides codice_83 for chaining headers of the same name.

;Import
Unlike C and C++, Objective-C includes an codice_84 directive that is like codice_2 but results in a file being included only once eliminating the need for include guards and codice_16.

The Objective-C directive should not be confused with the C++ keyword codice_87, which is used to import C++ modules (since C++20), and is not a preprocessor directive.

== Other uses ==
Traditionally, the C preprocessor was a separate development tool from the compiler with which it is usually used. In that case, it can be used separately from the compiler. Notable examples include use with the (deprecated) imake system and for preprocessing Fortran. However, use as a general purpose preprocessor is limited since the source code language must be relatively C-like for the preprocessor to parse it. 

The GNU Fortran compiler runs &quot;traditional mode&quot; CPP before compiling Fortran code if certain file extensions are used. Intel offers a Fortran preprocessor, fpp, for use with the ifort compiler, which has similar capabilities.

CPP also works acceptably with most assembly languages and Algol-like languages. This requires that the language syntax not conflict with CPP syntax, which means no lines starting with codice_3 and that double quotes, which CPP interprets as string literals and thus ignores, don&#x27;t have syntactical meaning other than that. The &quot;traditional mode&quot; (acting like a pre-ISO C preprocessor) is generally more permissive and better suited for such use.

Some modern compilers such as the GNU C Compiler provide preprocessing as a feature of the compiler; not as a separate tool.

==Limitations==

=== Text substitution limitations ===
Text substitution has a relatively high risk of causing a software bug as compared to other programming constructs.

;Hidden multiple evaluation

Consider the common definition of a &quot;max&quot; macro:
#define max(a,b) (((a) &gt; (b)) ? (a) : (b))
The expressions represented by &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are both evaluated two times due to macro expansion, but this aspect is not obvious in the code where the macro is referenced. If the actual expressions have constant value, then multiple evaluation is not problematic from a logic standpoint even though it can affect runtime performance. But if an expression evaluates to a different value on subsequent evaluation, then the result may be unexpected. For example, given codice_89, the result of codice_90 is 2. If &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; were only evaluated once, the result of codice_91 would be the same, but with double evaluation the result is 3.

;Hidden order of operation

Failure to bracket arguments can lead to unexpected results. For example, a macro to double a value might be written as:
#define double(x) 2 * x
But codice_92 expands to codice_93 which due to order of operations, evaluates to 4 when the expected is 6. To mitigate this problem, a macro should bracket all expressions and substitution variables:
#define double(x) (2 * (x))
===Not general purpose===

The C preprocessor is not Turing-complete, but comes close. Recursive computations can be specified, but with a fixed upper bound on the amount of recursion performed. However, the C preprocessor is not designed to be, nor does it perform well as, a general-purpose programming language. As the C preprocessor does not have features of some other preprocessors, such as recursive macros, selective expansion according to quoting, and string evaluation in conditionals, it is very limited in comparison to a more general macro processor such as m4.

==Phase out==
Due to its limitations, C and C++ language features have been added over the years to minimize the value and need for the preprocessor. 

;Constant
For a long time, a preprocessor macro provided the preferred way to define a constant value. An alternative has always been to define a codice_94 variable, but that results in consuming runtime memory. A newer language construct (since C++11 and C23), codice_95 allows for declaring a compile-time constant value that need not consume runtime memory.

;Inline function
For a long time, a function-like macro was the only way to define function-like behavior that did not incur runtime function call overhead. Via the codice_96 keyword and optimizing compilers that inline automatically, some functions can be invoked without call overhead.

;Import
The include directive limits code structure since it only allows including the content of one file into another. More modern languages support a module concept that has public symbols that other modules import instead of including file content. Many contend that resulting code has reduced boilerplate and is easier to maintain since there is only one file for a module; not both a header and a body. C++20 adds modules, and an codice_87 statement that is not handled via preprocessing. Modules in C++ compile faster and link faster than traditional headers, and eliminate the necessity of guards or .
