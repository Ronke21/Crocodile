<text>Coconut oil (or coconut fat) is an edible oil derived from the kernels, meat, and milk of the coconut palm fruit. Coconut oil is a white solid fat below around , and a clear thin liquid oil at higher temperatures. Unrefined varieties have a distinct coconut aroma. Coconut oil is used as a food oil, and in industrial applications for cosmetics and detergent production. The oil is rich in medium-chain fatty acids. 

Due to its high levels of saturated fat, numerous health authorities recommend limiting its consumption as a food.

Coconut oil is widely used for cooking and baking due to its high smoke point and distinct flavor. 

== Manufacturing ==
Coconut oil can be extracted through a wet or dry process. More simply (but perhaps less effectively), oil can be produced by heating the meat via boiling water, the sun or a slow fire.

===Wet process===
[[ File:9129Processing and cooking of coconut healing oil in the Philippines 43.jpg | thumb | Traditional () extraction directly from [[coconut milk|the milk]] in the [[Philippines]]. The process also produces &quot;[[latik]]&quot; (curds), used as a [[Garnish (food)|garnish]] in Filipino desserts.
The all-wet process uses [[coconut milk]] extracted from raw coconut rather than dried [[copra]]. The proteins in the coconut milk create an [[emulsion]] of oil and water. The more problematic step is breaking up the emulsion to recover the oil. This used to be done by prolonged boiling, but this produces a discolored oil and is not economical. Modern techniques use [[centrifuge]]s and pre-treatments including cold, heat, acids, salts, [[enzyme]]s, [[electrolysis]], shock waves, [[steam distillation]], or some combination thereof. Despite numerous variations and technologies, wet processing is less viable than dry processing due to a 10–15% lower yield, even taking into account the losses due to spoilage and pests with dry processing. Wet processes also require investment in equipment and energy, incurring high capital and operating costs.

===Dry process===
[[ File:Coconut oil making Seychelles.jpg | thumb | Traditional manufacturing in [[Seychelles]] | alt=Traditional way of making coconut oil using an [[ox]]-powered mill in [[Seychelles]]
Dry processing requires that the meat be extracted from the shell and dried using fire, sunlight, or [[kiln]]s to create copra. The copra is pressed or dissolved with [[solvent]]s, producing the coconut oil and a high-[[protein]], high-[[dietary fiber|fiber]] mash. The mash is of poor quality for human consumption and is instead fed to [[ruminant]]s; there is no process to extract protein from the mash.

Proper harvesting of the coconut (the age of a coconut can be 2 to 20 months when picked) makes a significant difference in the efficacy of the oil-making process. Copra made from immature nuts is more difficult to work with and produces an inferior product with lower yields.

Conventional coconut oil processors use [[hexane]] as a solvent to extract up to 10% more oil than is produced with just [[mill (grinding)|rotary mills]] and [[expeller pressing|expellers]]. They then refine the oil to remove certain [[free fatty acids]] to reduce susceptibility to rancidification. Other processes to increase shelf life include using copra with a moisture content below 6%, keeping the moisture content of the oil below 0.2%, heating the oil to and adding [[salt]] or [[citric acid]].

===Virgin oil===
Virgin coconut oil (VCO) can be produced from fresh coconut milk, meat, or residue. Producing it from the fresh meat involves either wet-milling or drying the residue, and using a [[screw press]] to extract the oil. VCO can also be extracted from fresh meat by grating and drying it to a moisture content of 10–12%, then using a manual press to extract the oil. Producing it from coconut milk involves grating the coconut and mixing it with water, then squeezing out the oil. The milk can also be fermented for 36–48 hours, the oil removed, and the cream heated to remove any remaining oil. A third option involves using a centrifuge to separate the oil from the other liquids. Coconut oil can also be extracted from the dry residue left over from the production of coconut milk.

A thousand mature coconuts weighing approximately yield around of copra from which around of coconut oil can be extracted.

===Refined oil===
[[ File:Coconut-oil-on-wooden-spoon.jpg |thumb|Coconut oil on a wooden spoon]]
Refined, bleached, and deodorized (RBD) oil is usually made from copra and dried coconut kernels, which are pressed in a heated [[hydraulic press]] to extract the oil. This yields practically all the oil present, amounting to more than 60% of the dry weight of the coconut. This crude coconut oil is not suitable for consumption because it contains contaminants and must be refined with further heating and filtering.

Another method for extraction of coconut oil involves the [[enzymatic]] action of [[alpha-amylase]], [[polygalacturonase]]s, and [[protease]]s on diluted coconut paste.

Unlike virgin coconut oil, refined coconut oil has no coconut taste or aroma. RBD oil is used for home cooking, commercial food processing, and cosmetic, industrial, and pharmaceutical purposes.

=== Hydrogenation ===
RBD coconut oil can be processed further into partially or fully [[Fat hydrogenation|hydrogenated]] oil to increase its melting point. Since virgin and RBD coconut oils melt at , foods containing coconut oil tend to melt in warm climates. A higher melting point is desirable in these warm climates, so the oil is hydrogenated. The melting point of hydrogenated coconut oil is .

In the process of hydrogenation, unsaturated fats (monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids) are combined with hydrogen in a catalytic process to make them more saturated. Coconut oil contains only 6% monounsaturated and 2% polyunsaturated fatty acids. In the partial hydrogenation process, some of these are transformed into [[trans fatty acids]].

=== Fractionation ===
[[Fractionated]] coconut oil provides fractions of the whole oil so that its different fatty acids can be separated for specific uses. [[Lauric acid]], a 12-carbon chain fatty acid, is often removed because of its high value for industrial and medical purposes. The fractionation of coconut oil can also be used to isolate [[caprylic acid]] and [[capric acid]], which are [[medium-chain triglycerides]], as these are used for medical applications, special diets and cosmetics, sometimes also being used as a carrier oil for fragrances.
===Standards===

The World Health Organization&#x27;s &quot;[[Codex Alimentarius]]&quot; guidelines on food, food production, and food safety, published by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]], includes standards for commercial partners who produce coconut oil for human consumption.

The [[Asian and Pacific Coconut Community]] (APCC), whose 18 members produce about 90 per cent of the coconut sold commercially, has published its standards for virgin coconut oil (VCO), defining virgin coconut oil as obtained from fresh, mature coconut kernels through means that do not &quot;lead to alteration of the oil.&quot; 

===Pests===
Oil quality and production are dependent upon palm cultivation, which is threatened by [[coconut pest]]s, such as the &quot;[[Oryctes]]&quot; rhinoceros beetles especially the Asiatic rhinoceros beetle (&quot;[[Oryctes rhinoceros|O. rhinoceros]]&quot;) and the red palm weevil (&quot;[[Rhynchophorus ferrugineus]]&quot;).

==Production==
In 2020, world production of coconut oil was , led by the [[Philippines]] and [[Indonesia]] accounting together for 60% of the world total.

==Composition and comparison==
Coconut oil contains only trace amounts of free fatty acids (about 0.03% by mass). Most of the fatty acids are present in the form of esters. In the following content, the expressions &quot;fatty acids&quot; and &quot;acid&quot; below refer to [[esters]] rather than [[carboxylic acids]].

The approximate concentration of fatty acids in coconut oil (midpoint of range in source):
The following table provides information about the composition of coconut oil and how it compares with other vegetable oils.
==Health concerns==
Many health organizations advise against the consumption of coconut oil owing to its high levels of [[saturated fat]], including the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]], [[World Health Organization]], the United States [[Department of Health and Human Services]], [[American Dietetic Association]], [[American Heart Association]], British [[National Health Service]], [[British Nutrition Foundation]], and [[Dietitians of Canada]].

Marketing of coconut oil has created the inaccurate belief that it is a &quot;healthy food&quot;. Instead, studies have found that coconut oil consumption has health effects similar to those of other unhealthy fats, including [[butter]], [[beef fat]], and [[palm oil]]. Coconut oil contains a high amount of [[lauric acid]], a saturated fat that raises total blood cholesterol levels by increasing the amounts of both [[high-density lipoprotein]] (HDL) cholesterol and [[low-density lipoprotein]] (LDL) cholesterol. Although lauric acid consumption may create a more favorable total blood cholesterol profile, this does not exclude the possibility that persistent consumption of coconut oil may actually increase the risk of [[cardiovascular disease]]s through other mechanisms, particularly via the marked increase in total blood cholesterol induced by lauric acid. Because the majority of saturated fat in coconut oil is lauric acid, coconut oil may be preferred over [[hydrogenation|partially hydrogenated vegetable oil]] when solid fats are used in the diet.

===Clinical research===
A 2017 review of clinical research by experts associated with the American Heart Association recommended against consumption of coconut oil due to its propensity for increasing blood levels of LDL as a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.

A 2020 [[systematic review]] and [[meta-analysis]] of [[clinical trial]]s on whether chronic consumption of coconut oil might affect [[Risk factor (epidemiology)|risk factor]]s for [[cardiovascular disease]]s found that [[low-density lipoprotein]] (LDL) cholesterol (but also [[high-density lipoprotein]] (HDL)) concentrations were elevated compared with non-tropical [[vegetable oil]]s. The review stated that &quot;coconut oil should not be viewed as healthy oil for cardiovascular disease risk reduction, and limiting coconut oil consumption because of its high saturated fat content is warranted.&quot;

==Uses==
===Nutrition and fat composition===
Coconut oil is 99% fat, composed mainly of saturated fats (82% of total; table). In a 100 gram reference amount, coconut oil supplies 890 [[calories]]. Half of the saturated fat content of coconut oil is lauric acid (41.8 grams per 100 grams of total composition), while other significant saturated fats are [[myristic acid]] (16.7g), [[palmitic acid]] (8.6g), and [[caprylic acid]] (6.8g). [[Monounsaturated fat]]s are 6% of total composition, and [[polyunsaturated fat]]s are 2% (table). Coconut oil contains [[phytosterols]], whereas there are no [[micronutrient]]s in significant content (table).
===In food===
Coconut oil has a long history in [[Asia]], particularly in tropical regions where the plant is abundant, where it has been used for cooking. It is the oil of choice in [[Sri Lankan cuisine]], where it is used for sautéing and frying, in both savoury and sweet dishes. It also plays a prominent role in the cuisines of [[Thailand]] and [[Kerala]].

As an oil relatively recently introduced to Western countries, coconut oil is commonly used in baked goods, pastries, and [[sauté]]s, having a nut-like quality with some sweetness. It is sometimes used by movie theatre chains to pop [[popcorn]].

Other culinary uses include replacing solid fats produced through [[hydrogenation]] in baked and [[confectionery]] goods. [[Trans fat|Hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated coconut oil]] is often used in [[non-dairy creamer]]s and snack foods. In frying, the [[smoke point]] of coconut oil is .

===Industry===

Coconut oil has been tested for use as a feedstock for [[biodiesel]] to use as a [[diesel engine]] fuel. In this manner, it can be applied to power [[Engine-generator|generator]]s and transport using diesel engines. Since straight coconut oil has a high [[gel]]ling temperature (), a high [[viscosity]], and a minimum [[combustion chamber]] temperature of (to avoid [[polymerization]] of the fuel), coconut oil typically is [[transesterified]] to make biodiesel. Use of B100 (100% biodiesel) is possible only in temperate climates, as the gel point is approximately . The oil must meet the [[Weihenstephan Standards|Weihenstephan standard]] to use pure vegetable oil as a fuel. Moderate to severe damage from [[carbonisation]] and clogging would occur in an unmodified engine.

The Philippines, [[Vanuatu]], [[Samoa]], and several other tropical island countries use coconut oil as an alternative fuel source to run automobiles, trucks, and buses, and to power generators. Biodiesel fuel derived from coconut oil is currently used as a fuel for transport in the Philippines. Further research into the potential of coconut oil as a fuel for electricity generation is being carried out in the islands of the Pacific, although to date it appears that it is not useful as a fuel source due to the cost of labour and supply constraints.

Coconut oil has been tested for use as an [[Motor oil|engine lubricant]] and as a [[transformer oil]]. Coconut oil (and derivatives, such as coconut fatty acid) are used as raw materials in the manufacture of [[surfactants]] such as [[cocamidopropyl betaine]], [[cocamide MEA]], and [[cocamide DEA]].

Acids derived from coconut oil can be used as [[herbicide]]s. Treatment with catalytic lipase has reportedly given coconut oil antimicrobial characteristics. Before the advent of electrical lighting, coconut oil was the primary oil used for illumination in India and was exported as cochin oil.

===Soap===
Coconut oil is an important base ingredient for the manufacturing of soap. Soap made with coconut oil tends to be hard, though it retains more water than soap made with other oils and thus increases manufacturer yields. It is more soluble in hard water and salt water than other soaps allowing it to lather more easily.

=== Other uses ===
It can be used as fuel for burning in a [[torch]] or dripped into fire to create [[Insect repellent|insect-repelling]] smoke. It also protects metal from corrosion.

<text>Francesco Clemente Giuseppe Sparanero (born 23 November 1941), known professionally as Franco Nero, is an Italian actor. His breakthrough role was as the title character in the Spaghetti Western film &quot;Django&quot; (1966), which made him a pop culture icon and launched an international career that includes over 200 leading and supporting roles in a wide variety of films and television productions.

During the 1960s and 1970s, Nero was actively involved in many popular Italian &quot;genre trends&quot;, including &quot;polizieschi&quot;, &quot;gialli&quot; and Spaghetti Westerns. His best-known films include: &quot;The Bible: In the Beginning...&quot; (1966), &quot;Camelot&quot; (1967), &quot;The Day of the Owl&quot; (1968), &quot;The Mercenary&quot; (1968), &quot;Battle of Neretva&quot; (1969), &quot;Tristana&quot; (1970), &quot;Compañeros&quot; (1970), &quot;Confessions of a Police Captain&quot; (1971), &quot;The Fifth Cord&quot; (1971), &quot;High Crime&quot; (1973), &quot;Street Law&quot; (1974), &quot;Keoma&quot; (1976), &quot;Hitch-Hike&quot; (1977), &quot;Force 10 from Navarone&quot; (1978), &quot;Enter the Ninja&quot; (1981), &quot;Die Hard 2&quot; (1990), &quot;Letters to Juliet&quot; (2010), &quot;Cars 2&quot; (2011), &quot;John Wick: Chapter 2&quot; (2017), and &quot;The Pope&#x27;s Exorcist&quot; (2023). 

Nero has had a long relationship with Vanessa Redgrave, which began during the filming of &quot;Camelot&quot;. With Redgrave, Nero starred in two films directed by Tinto Brass: &quot;Dropout&quot; (1970) and &quot;La Vacanza&quot; (1971). They were married in 2006, and are the parents of the actor Carlo Gabriel Nero (b.1969).

==Early life==
Francesco Clemente Giuseppe Sparanero was born in San Prospero Parmense (Parma, Emilia-Romagna), the son of a commissioned officer in the Carabinieri. His parents were originally from San Severo (Foggia, Apulia). He grew up in Bedonia and in Milan. He studied briefly at the Economy and Trade faculty of the local university, before leaving to study at the Piccolo Teatro di Milano.

==Career==
Nero&#x27;s first film role was a small part in &quot;Pelle viva&quot; (1962), and he had his first lead role in Sergio Corbucci&#x27;s &quot;Django&quot; (1966) a Spaghetti Western and one of his best-known films. In 1966 from &quot;Django&quot; he went on to appear in eight more films released that year including &quot;Texas, Adios&quot; (1966) and &quot;Massacre Time&quot;.

In 1967, he appeared in &quot;Camelot&quot; as Lancelot, where Nero met his longtime romantic partner, and later his wife, Vanessa Redgrave. Following this he appeared in the mafia film &quot;Il The Day of the Owl&quot; opposite Claudia Cardinale released in 1968.

A lack of proficiency in English tended to limit these roles, although Nero also appeared in other English-language films including &quot;The Virgin and the Gypsy&quot; (1970), &quot;Force 10 from Navarone&quot; (1978), &quot;Enter the Ninja&quot; (1981) and &quot;Die Hard 2&quot; (1990).

Although often typecast in films like &quot;Los amigos&quot; (1973) or &quot;Keoma&quot; (1976) he has attempted an impressive range of characters, such as Abel in John Huston&#x27;s epic &quot;The Bible: In The Beginning&quot; (1966), the humiliated engineer out for revenge in &quot;Street Law&quot;, the gay lieutenant in &quot;Querelle&quot; (1982), and Serbian mediaeval hero in &quot;The Falcon&quot; (1983). Nero has appeared in over 150 films, and has written, produced and starred in one: &quot;Jonathan degli orsi&quot; (1993).

More recently, Nero starred in Hungarian director &#x27;s &quot;Honfoglalás (Conquest)&quot; in 1996, in &quot;Li chiamarono... briganti!&quot; (1999) by Pasquale Squitieri and subsequently in Koltay&#x27;s &quot;Sacra Corona (Holy Crown)&quot; in 2001.

In 2009, Nero played an eccentric author called &quot;Mario Puzzo&quot; in &quot;Mord ist mein Geschäft, Liebling&quot; (&quot;Murder is my trade, darling&quot;, Italian title &quot;Tesoro, sono un killer&quot;). German critics found his performance was the best part of the film: &quot;Having Franco Nero playing in this film is really a great joy – it is only regrettable that after his appearances there is still so much film left.&quot;

In 2010, Nero appeared in the film &quot;Letters to Juliet&quot; with Redgrave. In 2011, he appeared as a guest star on the season 13 premiere episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;. His character, although Italian, was based on Dominique Strauss-Kahn. In the same year, he received a star on the Italian Walk of Fame in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

In 2012, Nero made a cameo appearance in the film &quot;Django Unchained&quot; in one scene alongside Jamie Foxx, who stars as Django Freeman in the film. Nero, playing the original Django, questions Foxx&#x27;s Django about how his name is spelled, and asks him to spell it, referencing a scene from Nero&#x27;s role as Django in the original &quot;Django&quot; film. Upon learning that their names are spelled the same way, Nero&#x27;s Django says &quot;I know&quot; to Foxx&#x27;s Django.

In 2016 and 2017, he interpreted Gabriele Tinti&#x27;s poetry, giving voice to the masterpieces in the National Roman Museum.

Nero appears in the dark comedy feature film &quot;The Immortalist&quot; in 2020, along with Sherilyn Fenn, Paul Rodriguez, Aries Spears and Jeff DuJardin, directed by Vlad Kozlov.

In June 2024, principal photography was completed on &quot;The Estate,&quot; a feature drama, executive produced by Nero, his wife Vanessa Redgrave, and son Carlo Gabriel Nero. The film is written and directed by his son, and stars Nero and Vanessa Redgrave.

==Personal life==

His romantic involvement with English actress Vanessa Redgrave began in 1966 when they met on the set of &quot;Camelot&quot;. In 1969, they had a son, Carlo Gabriel Redgrave Sparanero (known professionally as Carlo Gabriel Nero), a screenwriter and director. After separating for many years, during which they both had relationships with other people, they reunited and married on 31 December 2006. Carlo Nero directed Redgrave in the cinematic adaptation of Wallace Shawn&#x27;s play &quot;The Fever&quot;.

Nero dated actresses Catherine Deneuve, Goldie Hawn and Ursula Andress in the 1970s.

In 1983, he had a second son, Frank Sparanero (also known as Frankie Nero or Frank Nero Jr). Born in Rome by Danica Pevec (a.k.a. Alexandra Romanov), Frankie began his acting career with Pupi Avati in 1996 at a film &quot;Festival&quot; and then 1999 with the film &quot;Buck and the Magic Bracelet&quot; by Tonino Ricci. In addition to being an actor, he is also an artist, architect and photographer. 

In December 1987, a paternity suit was filed against him in court in Colombia where he was filming a movie. Mauricia Mena claimed that Nero had fathered her son Franquito after a brief romantic affair.

In 1994, Nero walked his future stepdaughter Natasha Richardson (1963–2009) down the aisle when she married actor Liam Neeson. Her father, Tony Richardson, had died in 1991.

<doc id="239918" wikidata="Q506004" url="?curid=239918" title="Tap water">
<text>Tap water (also known as running water, piped water or municipal water) is water supplied through a tap, a water dispenser valve. In many countries, tap water usually has the quality of drinking water. Tap water is commonly used for drinking, cooking, and washing. Indoor tap water is distributed through indoor plumbing, which has been around since antiquity but was available to very few people until the second half of the 19th century when it began to spread in popularity in what are now developed countries. Tap water became common in many regions during the 20th century, and is now lacking mainly among people in poverty, especially in developing countries.

Governmental agencies commonly regulate tap water quality. Calling a water supply &quot;tap water&quot; distinguishes it from the other main types of fresh water which may be available; these include water from rainwater-collecting cisterns, water from village pumps or town pumps, water from wells, or water carried from streams, rivers, or lakes (whose potability may vary).

== Terminology ==
A synonym for &quot;tap water&quot; is &quot;piped water,&quot; a term used by the Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) for Water Supply and Sanitation by WHO and UNICEF to describe the situation for access to drinking water in developing countries. Piped water is not necessarily of drinking water quality but does count as an &quot;improved water source&quot; in the logic of Sustainable Development Goal 6. Other improved water sources include boreholes, protected dug wells or springs, rainwater, and bottled or water delivered by tanker.

==Fixtures and appliances==
Everything in a building that uses water falls under one of two categories; fixture or appliance. As the consumption points above perform their function, most produce waste/sewage components that will require removal by the waste/sewage side of the system. The minimum is an air gap. See cross connection control &amp; backflow prevention for an overview of backflow prevention methods and devices currently in use, both through the use of mechanical and physical principles.

Fixtures are devices that use water without an additional source of power.

===Fittings and valves===
Potable water supply systems are composed of pipes, fittings, and valves.

==== Water flow reduction ====
Water flow through a tap can be reduced by inexpensive small plastic flow reducers. These restrict flow between 15 and 50%, aiding water conservation and reducing the burden on both water supply and treatment facilities.

===Materials===

The installation of water pipes can be done using the following plastic and metal materials:

====Plastic====
* polybutylene (PB)
* high density cross-linked polyethylene (PE-X)
* block copolymer of polypropylene (PP-B)
* the polypropylene copolymer (PP-H)
* random copolymer of polypropylene (random) (PP-R)
* Layer: cross-linked polyethylene, aluminum, high-density polyethylene (PE-X / Al / PE-HD)
* Layer: polyethylene crosslinked, aluminum, cross-linked polyethylene (PE-X / Al / PE-X)
* Layer copolymer of a random polypropylene, aluminum, polypropylene random copolymer (PP-R / Al / PP-R)
* polyvinyl chloride, chlorinated (PVC-C)
* polyvinyl chloride - not softened(only cold water) (PVC-U)

====Metals====
* carbon steel, ordinary galvanized
* corrosion resistant steel
* Deoxidized High Phosphorus copper (Cu-DHP)
* lead (no longer used for new installations due to its toxicity)

Other materials, if the pipes made from them have been let into circulation and the widespread use in the construction of the water supply systems.

==== Lead pipes ====
For many centuries, water pipes were made of lead, because of its ease of processing and durability. The use of lead pipes was a cause of health problems due to ignorance of the dangers of lead on the human body, which causes miscarriages and high death rates of newborns. Lead pipes, which were installed mostly in the late 1800s in the US, are still common today, much of which are located in the Northeast and the Midwest. Their impact is relatively small due to the fouling of pipes and stone cessation of the evolution of lead in the water; however, lead pipes are still detrimental. Most of the lead pipes that exist today are being removed and replaced with the more common material, copper or some type of plastic.

==Distribution systems and contamination==
Modern plumbing delivers clean, safe, and potable water to each service point in water distribution system, including taps. It is important that the clean water not be contaminated by the wastewater (disposal) side of the process system. Historically, this contamination of drinking water has been one of the largest killers of humans.

Most of the mandates for enforcing drinking water quality standards are not for the distribution system, but for the treatment plant. Even though the water distribution system is supposed to deliver the treated water to the consumers&#x27; taps without water quality degradation, complicated physical, chemical, and biological factors within the system can cause contamination of tap water.

Tap water can sometimes appear cloudy and is often mistaken for mineral impurities in the water. It is usually caused by air bubbles coming out of solution due to change in temperature or pressure. Because cold water holds more air than warm water, small bubbles will appear in water. It has a high dissolved gas content that is heated or depressurized, which reduces how much dissolved gas the water can hold. The harmless cloudiness of the water disappears quickly as the gas is released from the water.

== Water supply ==
==Comparison to bottled water==

=== United States ===
Contaminant levels found in tap water vary between households and plumbing systems. While the majority of US households have access to high-quality tap water, demand for bottled water increases. In 2002, the Gallup Public Opinion Poll revealed that the possible health risk associated with tap water consumption is one of the main reasons that cause American consumers to prefer bottled water over tap water.

The trust level towards tap water depends on various criteria, including the existing governmental regulations towards the water quality and their appliance. In 1993, the cryptosporidium outbreak in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, led to a massive hospitalization of more than 400,000 residents and was considered the largest in US history. Severe violations of tap water standards influence the decrease in public trust.

The difference in water quality between bottled and tap water is debatable. In 1999, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) released controversial findings from a 4-year study on bottled water. The study claimed that one-third of the tested waters were contaminated with synthetic organic chemicals, bacteria, and arsenic. At least one sample exceeded state guidelines for contamination levels in bottled water.

In the United States, some municipalities make an effort to use tap water over bottled water on governmental properties and events. Voters in Washington State repealed a bottled water tax via citizen initiative.

<doc id="239919" wikidata="Q1143726" url="?curid=239919" title="Bunt (baseball)">
<text>A bunt is a batting technique in baseball or fastpitch softball. Official Baseball Rules define a bunt as follows: &quot;A bunt is a batted ball not swung at, but intentionally met with the bat and tapped slowly within the infield.&quot; To bunt, the batter loosely holds the bat in front of home plate and intentionally taps the ball into play. A properly executed bunt will create weak contact with the ball and/or strategically direct it, forcing the infielders to make a difficult defensive play to record an out.

==Technique==
The strategy in bunting is to ground the ball into fair territory, as far from the fielders as possible but within the infield. This requires not only physical dexterity and concentration, but also an awareness of the fielders&#x27; positions in relation to the baserunner or baserunners, their likely reactions to the bunt, and knowledge of the pitcher&#x27;s most likely pitches.

The bunt is typically executed by the batter turning his body toward the pitcher and sliding one hand up the barrel of the bat to help steady it. This is called &quot;squaring up&quot;. Depending on the situation, the batter might square up either before the pitcher winds up, or as the pitched ball approaches the plate. Sometimes, a batter may square up, then quickly retract the bat and take a full swing as the pitch is delivered.

==Types==

===Sacrifice bunt===
In a sacrifice bunt, the batter will put the ball into play with the intention of advancing a baserunner, in exchange for the batter being thrown out. The sacrifice bunt is most often used to advance a runner from first to second base, though the runner may also be advanced from second to third base, or from third to home. The sacrifice bunt is most often used in close, low-scoring games, and it is usually performed by weaker hitters. A sacrifice bunt is not counted as an at-bat. In general, when sacrifice bunting, a batter will square to bunt well before the pitcher releases the ball.

The squeeze play occurs when the batter sacrifices with the purpose of scoring a runner from third base. In the &quot;suicide squeeze&quot;, in which the runner on third base starts running for home plate as soon as the pitcher starts to pitch the ball, it is integral that the batter bunt the ball successfully, or the runner will likely be tagged out easily. Due to the high-risk nature of this play, it is not often executed, but can often be an exciting moment within the game. Alternatively, in the lower-risk &quot;safety squeeze&quot;, the runner on third waits for the ball to be bunted before breaking for home. If a runner scores in a squeeze play, the batter may be credited with an RBI.

===Bunting for a base hit===
A batter may also &quot;bunt for a base hit&quot;. This is not a sacrifice play, because the batter is trying to reach base safely, without any intention of advancing a runner. A batter may try to bunt for a base hit while there are runners on base. In this case, if the runner advances and the batter is thrown out, and if the official scorer judges that the intention of the batter was to bunt for a base hit, then the batter will not receive credit for a sacrifice bunt. A batter bunting for a base hit will often hold back his bunt while the pitcher begins delivering the ball, in order to surprise the fielders. If successful, the bunt is scored as a hit single. Rarely does a bunt result in a double, and never has one resulted in a triple in MLB.

Often when attempting to bunt for a base hit, the batter will begin running as he is bunting the ball. This is called a &quot;drag bunt&quot;. Left-handed batters perform this more often than right-handed hitters, because their stance in the batter&#x27;s box is closer to first base, and they do not need to run across home plate, where the ball will be pitched, as they bunt.

The action of squaring to bunt is compromised during a drag bunt, as the feet are not set. Players sometimes get one hand up the barrel, and other times bunt with both hands at the base of the bat. There have been instances of one-handed drag bunts as well; Rafael Furcal has been known to try such a bunt.

===Swinging bunt===
A &quot;swinging bunt&quot; occurs when a poorly hit ball rolls a short distance into play, much like a bunt. A swinging bunt is often the result of a checked swing, and only has the appearance of a bunt. It is not a true bunt, and if the scorer judges that the batter intended to hit the ball, it cannot be counted as a sacrifice. There is also a &quot;slug&quot; bunt that is intended to surprise the opposing defense, as the desired effect is a hard-hit ball into the infield defense that is expecting a standard bunt.

==Fielding a bunt==

Fielding a bunt can be more difficult than fielding a normally batted ball. Bunted balls are typically slow, so fielders must &quot;charge&quot; the ball to get to it quickly, in order to throw out a runner in time. Well-placed bunts can sometimes be impossible to field, and result in base hits. The tactic in bunting for a base hit is to hit the ball fast enough to get it past the pitcher, but slow enough to not allow time for the other infielders to make a play. Bunting a ball into &quot;no-man&#x27;s land&quot; – the triangle between the locations of the pitcher, first baseman, and second baseman, or between the pitcher, catcher and third baseman – can succeed because of uncertainty among the fielders as to which should field the ball and which should receive the throw to first base. It is not unusual for all three fielders to try to field the ball, and for nobody to cover the bag, or for no one to try to field the ball, assuming someone else will handle it. Teams use a &quot;rotation play&quot; to defend against the bunt: the first baseman will charge the bunt and the second baseman &quot;rotates&quot; out of his usual position to cover first base and receive the throw. The shortstop covers the base towards which the runner is headed.

==Special rules==
A foul bunt that is not caught in flight is always counted as a strike, even if it is a third strike and thus results in a strikeout of the batter. This is distinct from all other foul balls which, if not caught in flight, are only counted as a strike if &quot;not&quot; a third strike. This special exception applies only to true bunts, not on any bunt-like contacts that might occur during a full swing or check-swing. If a batter bunts the ball and his bat hits the ball again after initial contact, it is a dead ball even if by accident.

Additionally, the infield fly rule is not applied to bunts popped-up in the air. Instead, the intentional drop rule (Rule 6.05k) that also applies to line drives can be invoked.

==History==
It is not known when the bunt was introduced; the earliest known reference to a bunt-like hit appears in the account of a game played in 1864 between the junior squads (&quot;muffins&quot;) of the Brooklyn Excelsior and Enterprise clubs: &quot;The feature of the play was the batting of Prof. Bassler of the Enterprise team...Being an original of the first water, he adopted an original theory in reference to batting, which we are obliged to confess is not of the most striking character. His idea is not a bad one though, it being to hit the ball slightly so as to have it drop near the home base, therefore necessitating the employment of considerable skill on the part of the pitcher to get at the ball, pick it up and throw it accurately to first base.&quot; But the batting technique now known as the bunt was almost certainly perfected by Dickey Pearce, one of baseball&#x27;s early stars. For much of his career, Pearce used his &#x27;tricky hit&#x27; to tremendous effect as the rules permitted it to roll foul and still be counted as a hit. The bunt was not common until the 1880s, and was not an accepted part of baseball strategy until the 20th century. The bunt has enjoyed periodic waves of popularity throughout baseball history, coinciding with the periodic shifts of dominance between pitching and hitting over the decades.

During periods of pitching dominance, for example, during the dead-ball era or the 1960s, bunting was an important offensive weapon. Conversely, during periods of hitting dominance, for example, the 1990s and 2000s, the value of the bunt has often been questioned. Teams following the &quot;&quot; school of baseball thought (such as the Oakland Athletics, the Boston Red Sox, and the 2004–2005 Los Angeles Dodgers) have shown a tendency to shun the sacrifice bunt almost entirely. However, a canvass of the 2002–2005 World Series champions (the 2002 Los Angeles Angels being the &quot;small ball&quot; trendsetter for the 2000s) reveals that each team used bunting frequently in order to overcome power hitting teams. Nevertheless, the role of the bunt in baseball strategy is one of the perennial topics of discussion for baseball fans.

<text>Prinia is a genus of small insectivorous birds belonging to the passerine bird family Cisticolidae. They were at one time classed in the Old World warbler family, Sylviidae.

The prinias are sometimes referred to as wren-warblers. They are a little-known group of the tropical and subtropical Old World, the roughly thirty species being divided fairly equally between Africa and Asia.

These are birds mainly of open habitats such as long grass or scrub, in which they are not easily seen. They are mainly resident, migration being limited to local cold weather movements. Non-breeding birds may form small flocks.

Prinias have short wings but long tapering tails. They are fairly drab birds, brown or grey above (sometimes with dark streaks) and whitish below. Some species have different breeding and non-breeding plumages. The bill is a typical insectivore&#x27;s, thin and slightly curved.

==Taxonomy==
The genus was erected by the American naturalist Thomas Horsfield in 1821. The type species is the bar-winged prinia (&quot;Prinia familiaris&quot;). The name of the genus is derived from the Javanese &quot;prinya&quot;, the local name for the bar-winged prinia.

A molecular phylogenetic study of the Cisticolidae published in 2013 found that the rufous-vented grass babbler did not lie within the clade containing the other prinias. Based on this analysis the rufous-vented prinia and the closely related swamp grass babbler were moved to the reinstated genus &quot;Laticilla&quot; in the family Pellorneidae.

===Species===
The genus contains 30 species:

Species formerly in &quot;Prinia&quot; but now moved to &quot;Laticilla&quot; in family Pellorneidae:
* Rufous-vented grass babbler, &quot;Laticilla burnesii&quot;
* Swamp grass babbler, &quot;Laticilla cinerascens&quot;

<text>The Volvo 66 is an automobile developed from the DAF 66, which was originally styled by Giovanni Michelotti. The compact car was introduced in August 1975, almost exactly a year after Volvo bought DAF, and before production of the Volvo 300 Series began.

The Volvo 66 was known for its continuously variable transmission, the Variomatic. The Volvo version of the car was slightly restyled and given larger bumpers compared with those of the original DAF model. Although this was in keeping with Volvo&#x27;s emphasis on safety, it also increased its cost of production.

The Volvo 66 was available as a two-door saloon and three-door estate, whilst the two-door Coupé bodystyle available on the DAF 66 was dropped.

The other major features in which the Volvo 66 differs from the DAF 66 are also mostly safety-related. It has different seats featuring headrests, a safety steering wheel, steel side-impact bars in the doors, and a de-clutching servo which enabled the driver to change gear with the choke engaged (In the older DAF models this was not possible, because the increased idle caused the centrifugal clutch to engage). The Volvo 66 also has a &#x27;park&#x27; mode in the CVT, which locks the driveline. From 1977 the estate version featured a window wiper on the bootlid.

== Number produced ==

Volvo produced roughly 106,000 units of both the saloon and estate 66, and no more than 14,000 were sold in the United Kingdom. The majority were sold in continental Europe rather than in Sweden, where the car was never accepted by traditional Volvo buyers.

<text>Water treatment is any process that improves the quality of water to make it appropriate for a specific end-use. The end use may be drinking, industrial water supply, irrigation, river flow maintenance, water recreation or many other uses, including being safely returned to the environment. Water treatment removes contaminants and undesirable components, or reduces their concentration so that the water becomes fit for its desired end-use. This treatment is crucial to human health and allows humans to benefit from both drinking and irrigation use.

== Types ==

=== Drinking water treatment ===

Water contamination is primarily caused by the discharge of untreated wastewater from enterprises. The effluent from various enterprises, which contains varying levels of contaminants, is dumped into rivers or other water resources. The wastewater may have a high proportion of organic and inorganic contaminants at the initial discharge. Industries generate wastewater as a result of fabrication processes, processes dealing with paper and pulp, textiles, chemicals, and from various streams such as cooling towers, boilers, and production lines.
Treatment for drinking water production involves the removal of contaminants and/or inactivation of any potentially harmful microbes from raw water to produce water that is enough for human consumption without any short term or long term risk of any adverse health effect. In general terms, the greatest microbial risks are associated with ingestion of water that is contaminated with human or animal (including bird) feces. Feces can be a source of pathogenic bacteria, viruses, protozoa and helminths. The removal or destruction of microbial pathogens is essential, and commonly involves the use of reactive chemical agents such as suspended solids, to remove bacteria, algae, viruses, fungi, and minerals including iron and manganese. Research including Professor Linda Lawton&#x27;s group at Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen is working to improve detection of cyanobacteria. These substances continue to cause great harm to several less developed countries who do not have access to effective water purification systems.

Measures taken to ensure water quality not only relate to the treatment of the water, but to its conveyance and distribution after treatment. It is therefore common practice to keep residual disinfectants in the treated water to kill bacteriological contamination during distribution and to keep the pipes clean.

Water supplied to domestic properties such as for tap water or other uses, may be further treated before use, often using an in-line treatment process. Such treatments can include water softening or ion exchange. 

=== Wastewater treatment ===
=== Industrial water treatment ===

== Processes ==

For the elimination of hazardous chemicals from the water, many treatment procedures have been applied.

The processes involved in removing the contaminants include physical processes such as settling and filtration, chemical processes such as disinfection and coagulation, and biological processes such as slow sand filtration.

A combination selected from the following processes (depending on the season and contaminants and chemicals present in the raw water) is used for municipal drinking water treatment worldwide.

=== Chemical ===
Different chemical procedures for the conversion into final products or the removal of pollutants are used for the safe disposal of contaminants.
* Pre-chlorination for algae control and arresting biological growth.
* Aeration along with pre-chlorination for removal of dissolved iron when present with relatively small amounts of manganese.
* Disinfection for killing bacteria, viruses and other pathogens, using chlorine, ozone and ultra-violet light.

=== Physical ===
Physical techniques of water/waste water treatment rely on physical phenomena to complete the removal process, rather than biological or chemical changes.

Most common physical techniques are:
* Sedimentation is one of the most important main wastewater treatment procedures. Gravity settling is a method of separating particles from a fluid. The particle in suspension remains stable in quiescent conditions due to the decrease in water velocity throughout the water treatment process, following which the particles settle by gravitational force. For solids separation that is the removal of suspended solids trapped in the floc.
* Filtration is the technique of removing pollutants based on their particle size. Pollutant removal from waste water permits water to be reused for a variety of purposes. The types of filters used in the procedure differ depending on the contaminants present in the water. Particle filtration and Membrane filtration are the two main forms of waste water filtration.
* Dissolved air flotation (Degasification) is the process of removing dissolved gases from a solution . Henry&#x27;s law states that the amount of dissolved gas in a liquid is proportionate to the partial pressure of the gas. Degasification is a low-cost method of removing carbon dioxide gas from waste water that raises the pH of the water by removing the gas.
* Deaerator is used to reduce oxygen and nitrogen in boiler feed water applications.

=== Physico-chemical ===
Also referred to as &quot;Conventional&quot; Treatment
* Coagulation for flocculation. The addition of coagulants destabilizes colloidal suspensions by neutralizing their charges, resulting in the aggregation of smaller particles during the coagulation process.
* Coagulant aids, also known as polyelectrolytes – to improve coagulation and for more robust floc formation.
* Polyelectrolytes or also known in the field as polymers, usually consist of either a positive or negative charge. The nature of the polyelectrolyte used is purely based on the source water characteristics of the treatment plant.
* These will usually be used in conjunction with a primary coagulant such as ferric chloride, ferric sulfate, or alum.
Chemical precipitation is a common process used to reduce heavy metals concentrations in wastewater. The dissolved metal ions are transformed to an insoluble phase by a chemical interaction with a precipitant agent such as lime. In industrial applications stronger alkalis may be used to effect complete precipitation. In drinking water treatment, the common-ion effect is often used to help reduce water hardness.

Flotation uses bubble attachment to separate solids or dispersed liquids from a liquid phase.

==== Membrane filtration ====
Membrane filtration can remove suspended solids and organic components, and inorganic pollutants such heavy metals. For heavy metal removal, several forms of membrane filtration, such as ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, and reverse osmosis, can be used depending on the particle size that can be maintained. Aminophosphonates can be added for antiscalant properties to maintain filtration.

==== Ion exchange ====
Ion exchange is a reversible ion exchange process in which an insoluble substance (resin) takes ions from an electrolytic solution and releases additional ions of the same charge in a chemically comparable amount without changing the resin&#x27;s structure.

==== Electrochemical treatment techniques ====
* Electrodialysis (ED)
* Membrane electrolysis (ME)
* Electrochemical precipitation (EP)

==== Adsorption ====
Adsorption is a mass transfer process in which a substance is transported from the liquid phase to the surface of a solid/liquid (adsorbent) and becomes physically and chemically bonded (adsorbate). Adsorption can be classified into two forms based on the type of attraction between the adsorbate and the adsorbent: physical and chemical adsorption, commonly known as physisorption and chemisorptions.

===== Activated carbon =====
Activated carbons (ACs) or biological-activated carbon (BAC) are effective adsorbents for a wide variety of contaminants. The adsorptive removal of color, aroma, taste, and other harmful organics and inorganics from drinking water and wastewater is one of their industrial applications.

Both a high surface area and a large pore size can improve the efficiency of activated carbon. Activated carbon was utilized by a number of studies to remove heavy metals and other types of contaminants from wastewater. The cost of activated carbon is rising due to a shortage of commercial activated carbon (AC). Because of its high surface area, porosity, and flexibility, activated carbon has a lot of potential in wastewater treatment.

=== Biological ===
This is the method by which dissolved and suspended organic chemical components are eliminated through biodegradation, in which an optimal amount of microorganism is given to re-enact the same natural self-purification process. Through two distinct biological process, such as biological oxidation and biosynthesis, microorganisms can degrade organic materials in wastewater. Microorganisms involved in wastewater treatment produce end products such as minerals, carbon dioxide, and ammonia during the biological oxidation process. The minerals (products) remained in the wastewater and were discharged with the effluent. Microorganisms use organic materials in wastewater to generate new microbial cells with dense biomass that is eliminated by sedimentation throughout the biosynthesis process.

== Standards ==

Many developed countries specify standards to be applied in their own country. In Europe, this includes the European Drinking Water Directive and in the United States the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) establishes standards as required by the Safe Drinking Water Act. For countries without a legislative or administrative framework for such standards, the World Health Organization publishes guidelines on the standards that should be achieved. China adopted its own drinking water standard GB3838-2002 (Type II) enacted by Ministry of Environmental Protection in 2002.

Where drinking water quality standards do exist, most are expressed as guidelines or targets rather than requirements, and very few water standards have any legal basis or, are subject to enforcement. Two exceptions are the European Drinking Water Directive and the Safe Drinking Water Act in the United States, which require legal compliance with specific standards.

==Developing countries==

Appropriate technology options in water treatment include both community-scale and household-scale point-of-use (POU) or self-supply designs. Such designs may employ solar water disinfection methods, using solar irradiation to inactivate harmful waterborne microorganisms directly, mainly by the UV-A component of the solar spectrum, or indirectly through the presence of an oxide photocatalyst, typically supported TiO2 in its anatase or rutile phases. Despite progress in SODIS technology, military surplus water treatment units like the ERDLator are still frequently used in developing countries. Newer military style Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Units (ROWPU) are portable, self-contained water treatment plants are becoming more available for public use.

For waterborne disease reduction to last, water treatment programs that research and development groups start in developing countries must be sustainable by the citizens of those countries. This can ensure the efficiency of such programs after the departure of the research team, as monitoring is difficult because of the remoteness of many locations.

Energy Consumption: Water treatment plants can be significant consumers of energy. In California, more than 4% of the state&#x27;s electricity consumption goes towards transporting moderate quality water over long distances, treating that water to a high standard. In areas with high quality water sources which flow by gravity to the point of consumption, costs will be much lower.
Much of the energy requirements are in pumping. Processes that avoid the need for pumping tend to have overall low energy demands. Those water treatment technologies that have very low energy requirements including trickling filters, slow sand filters, gravity aqueducts.

A 2021 study found that a large-scale water chlorination program in urban areas of Mexico massively reduced childhood diarrheal disease mortality rates.

==Materials==

Stainless steels, such as Type 304L and 316L, are used extensively in the fabrication of water treatment plants due to their corrosion resistance to water and to the corrosivity of chlorination used for disinfection.

<doc id="239929" wikidata="Q1543111" url="?curid=239929" title="Volvo Amazon">
<text>The Volvo Amazon was a mid-sized car that was manufactured and marketed by Volvo Cars from 1956 to 1970. It was introduced in the United States as the &quot;122S&quot; at the 1959 New York International Auto Show.

The Amazon shared the wheelbase, tall posture and high H-point seating of its predecessor, the PV444/544, and was offered in two-door sedan, four-door sedan, and five-door wagon body styles — all noted for their &quot;ponton&quot; styling. In 1959 Volvo became the world&#x27;s first manufacturer to provide front seat belts as standard equipment — by providing them on all Amazon models, including the export models — and later becoming the first car featuring three-point seat belts as standard equipment.

When introduced, the car was named the Amason (with an &#x27;s&#x27;), deriving from the fierce female warriors of Greek mythology, the Amazons. German motorcycle manufacturer Kreidler had already registered the name, and the two companies agreed that Volvo could only use the name domestically (i.e., within Sweden), modifying the spelling to Amazon. Subsequently, Volvo began its tri-digit nomenclature and the line became known as the 120 Series.

The Amazon was originally manufactured at Volvo&#x27;s Lundby plant in Gothenburg and subsequently at the company&#x27;s Torslandaverken plant, which began operating in 1964. By the end of production, 234,653 four-door models, 359,917 two-door models and 73,220 station wagons had been produced, of which 60% were exported; for a total of 667,791 vehicles.

==Styling and design==
The Amazon sedan&#x27;s ponton genre, three-box styling was inspired by US cars of the early 1950s, strongly resembling the Chrysler New Yorker sedan and the Chrysler 300C hardtop Coupe. According to designer Jan Wilsgaard, the Amazon&#x27;s styling was inspired by a Kaiser he saw at the Gothenburg harbour.

The Amazon featured strong articulation front to rear, pronounced &quot;shoulders&quot;, and slight but visible tailfins. These features became inspiration for Peter Horbury when reconceiving Volvo&#x27;s design direction with the V70 after decades of rectilinear, slab-sided, boxy designs.

The Amazon&#x27;s bodywork was constructed of phosphate-treated steel (to improve paint adhesion) and with heavy use of undercoating and anti-corrosive oil treatment.

===Station wagon===
The station wagon (estate) version was introduced at the 1962 Stockholm Auto Show, and Volvo manufactured 73,000 examples between 1962 and 1969. The Amazon estate featured a two-piece tailgate, with the lower section folding down to provide a load surface and the upper section that hinged overhead. The vehicle&#x27;s rear license plate, attached to the lower tailgate, could fold &quot;up&quot; such that when the tailgate was lowered and the vehicle in use, the license plate was still visible. This idea was used by the original 1959 Mini. In recent years a similar arrangement was used on the tailgate of the Subaru Baja.

The Amazon platform was used as the basis for the P1800 and 1800ES.

==History==
Under prototype designation 1200, following the PV444&#x27;s internal designation as the 1100, the Amazon was released in the press in February 1956, with production initially set to begin in July of the same year, and deliveries commenced in August 1956 — under the now modified internal designation 120 series. Further iterations included the 121, the base model with a single carburetor engine, the 122S introduced in 1958 as a performance model equipped with a dual carburetor engine. The Amazon&#x27;s handbrake location, outboard of the driver&#x27;s seat, was intended to accommodate subsequent bench seat models with column shift transmissions- these were produced in small numbers and made available to certain export markets. Buyers began to receive the first cars in February 1957, and initial models were two-tone red and black with light gray roof, light grey with a black roof, followed by a dark blue with gray roof in 1958.

The Volvo Amazon in station wagon form would become the first foreign market police car introduced to any police force of the United Kingdom in 1965. Having trialled it against a Citroën DS19 Safari and Humber Super Snipe station wagon, Hampshire Constabulary purchased a white Volvo Amazon 1800 station wagon with a Ruddspeed upgraded engine initially for use as an accident tender, carrying equipment used by the police when attending scenes of road accidents, before transferring onto traffic policing duties alongside the Humber Super Snipe. In total, five white Volvo Amazon station wagons were acquired by Hampshire Constabulary&#x27;s traffic division, however the purchase of foreign police cars was the subject of local controversy, with letters of complaint written to Hampshire&#x27;s Chief Constable and in &quot;Autocar&quot; magazine; Hampshire Constabulary would later find themselves the subject of national controversy and faced heavy criticism by the Home Office for purchasing multiple Volvo 144 saloons for traffic police use.

In 1966 the Volvo PV ended production, replaced by the Amazon , a less expensive version of the Amazon, without exterior chrome trim, a passenger-side sunshield or cigarette lighter, and with a three-speed rather than four-speed transmission — available in black with red interior and later white or black with red interior. The newer Volvo 140 was becoming the company&#x27;s mainstream model, and the last of the four-door 120 saloons were produced in 1967. In 1967 came the 123GT, which was a Model 130 with high-compression four-cylinder B18B engine (from the Volvo P1800), M41 gearbox, fully reclining seats, front fog and driving lights (on some markets), alternator, fender mounted mirrors, special steering wheel, dash with a shelf and tachometer, and other cosmetic upgrades. In 1967 the 4-door saloon was discontinued due to the introduction of 140-series. In 1969 the displacement of the old B18 engine was increased and the engine was called the B20. Of note: Volvo Cars arriving in Canada at the port of Halifax, Nova Scotia would have the (not-yet-legal) radial tires removed and replaced with bias-ply tires of-the-day before being accepted by DOT for delivery. Also, the European &#x27;Flash-to-Pass&#x27; feature of the turn signal toggle would be disconnected for the British market as it did not have Department of Transport approval. Somehow, whereas most North American vehicles would only have lap safety belts until 1968, both driver and passenger got the &#x27;three-point&#x27; shoulder belts, a Volvo safety feature. Fortunately, these remained in place for the new owners and doubtless saving many from death and injury from accidents. 1970 was the last year for the Amazon, and only the 2-door version was left, since the estate wagon was cancelled.

The last Amazon was manufactured on 3 July 1970.

==Features==
Original specifications for the Amazon included the new Volvo B16 engine, a 3-speed manual gearbox (H6) and rear-wheel drive. In 1958 the sport model, &quot;Amazon Sport&quot;, was released and later the same year the Amazon became the first series produced car with a three-point safety belt in the front seats as standard. In 1962, Volvo introduced a two-door version, a five-door wagon, and the new B18 engine, deleting two-tone paint and upholstery. In 1965 the Amazon color-coordinated embossed vinyl upholstery and door panels became available. The new gearbox selections were the three-speed M30 (briefly offered with an automatic electric clutch), the four-speed M40 and the M41 with four-speed and overdrive. The M31 gearbox was also introduced in 1961 but was only available that year (a three-speed fully synchronized gearbox with overdrive on both second and third direct gears). Gearbox options on the 121 were the M30, M31 and M40 while gearbox options on the 122S were the M40 and M41 gearboxes. In 1964 the Borg-Warner BW35 three-speed automatic transmission also became available on the four-door and two-door. From 1967 to 1968 the BW35 was also available on the five-door wagon.

==History==


===Founding===
Temple University was founded in 1884 by Grace Baptist Church of Philadelphia and its pastor Russell Conwell, a Yale-educated lawyer, orator, and ordained Baptist minister, who served in the Union Army during the American Civil War. Conwell came to Pennsylvania in 1882 to lead the Grace Baptist Church. One evening in June 1884, a young aspiring minister named Charles Davies approached Conwell after a service to express his desire to prepare for the ministry, but did not have the means to attend college. Conwell offered to teach Davies, who showed up to the first class with six friends. By the third class, this number had reached forty. where he began tutoring working-class citizens at night in the basement of Conwell&#x27;s Baptist Temple (hence the origin of the university&#x27;s name and mascot).

Conwell&#x27;s night classes quickly grew popular within the North Philadelphia area. The Grace Baptist Church created a board of trustees, which named Russell Conwell president of the Temple College. Following an unsuccessful meeting with 34 Philadelphia Baptist churches, the Grace Baptist Church appointed a new board of trustees, printed official admissions files, and issued stock to raise funds for new teaching facilities. The church provided classrooms, and teachers, and financed the school in its early years. The church and Conwell&#x27;s desire was &quot;to give education to those who were unable to get it through the usual channels&quot;.

In 1891, Temple&#x27;s first graduating class of eighteen men received the Bachelor of Oratory degree. However, state and federal education agencies would not identify Temple as a legitimate college level institution. Philadelphia granted a charter in 1888 to establish the Temple College of Philadelphia, but the city refused to grant authority to award academic degrees. By 1888, the enrollment of the college was nearly 600: because of Temple&#x27;s aim of offering an education to Philadelphia&#x27;s working class, there were no admissions requirements and tuition was free.

Over time, Temple expanded. Samaritan Hospital (now Temple University Hospital) was founded by the Grace Baptist Church in 1892, and Temple added a medical school in 1901. Temple merged with Garretson Hospital the Philadelphia Dental College in 1906. After the merger, Temple officially reincorporated as Temple University on December 12, 1907. The School of Nursing was established in 1911, followed by the Teacher&#x27;s College in 1914. Russell Conwell died in 1925 after a 38-year presidency at Temple, and is buried at the Founder&#x27;s Garden on campus.

===20th century expansion===
In 1954, Temple&#x27;s board of trustees made a pledge to grow the campus to 210 acres. That year, Temple University agreed to terms to purchase of the adjacent Monument Cemetery and repurpose it for athletic fields and a parking lot. Families of the deceased claimed about 8,000 of the 28,000 bodies on the site and the rest were moved to an unmarked mass grave at Lawnview Memorial Park. Many of the remaining headstones from the cemetery, including a monument to George Washington and Marquis de Lafayette, were used as riprap for the Betsy Ross Bridge. This land is now an athletic field, student recreation center, and parking lot, and is slated to be a new media and performance center.

Temple hired Philadelphia architecture firm Nolen &amp; Swinburne Associates to devise a university expansion plan in 1955. The plan called for the demolition of historic row houses and proposed a classic campus quadrangle comprising large Modernist towers, a central plaza, a bell tower, walkways, lawns, and cloistered gardens. 
 The firm complained that the “squeeze of the slum area is becoming intolerable” and went on to say that Temple was positioned, finally, “to wipe the slate clean from the ground up. Hundreds of North Philadelphia residents were displaced when Temple demolished rowhomes, churches, and businesses to make room for its expansion. In 1966, Nolen &amp; Swinburne returned to work for Temple University, this time creating a development plan. All that remains of the 1800 block of Park Avenue is a group of facades that have been incorporated into a single building (called 1810 Liacouras Walk) and a small church (Shusterman Hall).

The Ambler Junior College of Temple University was formed by the merging of the Pennsylvania School of Horticulture for Women with Temple University. This created Temple University Ambler, which is approximately from Temple&#x27;s Main Campus. That same year, the Ambler Campus of Temple University began accepting men, two of which applied that year.

In 1965, Temple became a Pennsylvania state-related university, meaning the university receives state funds, subject to state appropriations, but is independently operated. It is one of four schools to have this designation, alongside Lincoln University, Pennsylvania State University, and the University of Pittsburgh. This is the only public-private hybrid system of higher education of its particular type in the United States.

In the spring of 1969, the Steering Committee for Black Students pushed for more community voices involved in Temple’s plans for expansion, as well as an Afro-Asian Institute and special admissions for Hispanic and African-American students. Then-university President Paul R. Anderson feigned cooperation, but meetings between the committee and school administration went nowhere. It wasn&#x27;t until Pennsylvania Governor Raymond Shafer forced one: Temple would limit the height of buildings on the campus perimeter and keep 10 of 22 disputed acres.

Marvin Wachman, Anderson&#x27;s successor, sought to be more open with students than Anderson was. When students protested over campus cafeteria food prices and seating arrangements, Wachman delivered what the students wanted: food trucks on campus. To this day, food trucks line the streets of Temple&#x27;s Main Campus, offering students an alternative to the dining halls.

Peter J. Liacouras, namesake of the Liacouras Center and Liacouras Walk, served as Temple’s seventh president from 1982 to 2000. Under Liacouras, Temple&#x27;s profile began to grow: men&#x27;s basketball coach John Chaney helped the team reach national prominence. Temple&#x27;s iconic &quot;T&quot; logo was designed under Liacouras&#x27;s presidency. Liacouras expanded both the school&#x27;s academics and budget: the university’s endowment rose from $15 million in 1982 to $109 million in 1999.

===21st century===
In 2016, Temple was classified by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching as a research university with very high research activity, with research expenditures reaching $242 million.

On March 13, 2020, the university ended in-person instruction due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Liacouras Center, Temple&#x27;s basketball arena, was converted into a 200-bed “COVID-19 Surge Facility” due to the potential of hospitals reaching patient capacity, although only 14 patients were admitted. Temple reopened Main Campus for the Fall 2020 semester under a hybrid model, offering a mix of online classes and in-person learning. The university required COVID-19 tests for all students moving into campus housing, face coverings to be worn in all buildings, and students and faculty maintain six feet of physical distance from one another to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. However, in September, Temple suspended in-person classes for remainder of fall semester, three days after deciding to stop in-person classes for two weeks as a precaution after 103 students on campus tested positive for COVID-19. In May 2022, Temple held its first in-person, university-wide graduation ceremony since 2019.

On November 29, 2021, Moshe Porat, former dean of Temple University&#x27;s business school was convicted on charges of conspiracy and wire fraud for a scheme in which he and others used false data to boost the school&#x27;s position on the &quot;US News &amp; World Report&quot; rankings.

On January 31, 2023, the graduate student workers&#x27; union at Temple University declared an ongoing labor strike, following a year of stalled negotiations for a labor contract. Temple University retaliated on February 8 by terminating the strikers&#x27; health insurance and tuition benefits, an action that propelled the strike to national news. The strike ended in mid-March.

Shortly after graduate student strike ended, university president Jason Wingard resigned. In the months prior to his resignation, he had come under fire for his decisions during the strike as well as a rise in crime and violence on and near the university&#x27;s campus. Shortly before his resignation, the university&#x27;s board of trustees had announced increased oversight of the university. The university&#x27;s faculty had also planned a no-confidence vote. JoAnne Epps was named Acting President on April 11, 2023. Epps died after suffering a sudden, as yet undisclosed, medical episode during a university event on September 19, 2023.

In October of 2023, Temple University students protested against the Israel–Hamas war  and criticized the administration&#x27;s pro-Israel stance. The protesters called for justice in Palestine and demanded financial divestment from companies that profit from the war in Gaza. The ACLU became involved when administration started disciplinary action against students for participating in a “Gaza Solidarity” encampment off-campus. The protests continued into the next academic year with the University amending its campus guidelines to discourage further protests.

On July 3, 2024, Temple&#x27;s Board of Trustees announced it has appointed John Fry as its 15th president.

===Traditions===
====Cherry and White====
Cherry and White are the official school colors of Temple University. Temple was the first school in the nation officially to use cherry as one of its colors. Cherry (both the color and less often, the fruit) is a common motif at Temple, from the Cherry Crusade fan club to the Cherry and White Directory. In 2008, Temple standardized the cherry color to be Pantone Matching System (PMS) 201.

====The Temple &quot;T&quot;====

The university&#x27;s symbol, the Temple &quot;T&quot;, was designed by students in a graphic arts and design class in the Tyler School of Art and Architecture in 1983. It is, of course, cherry and white. The &quot;T&quot; represents strength and positive character, with the open ends showing the free exchange of ideas that is the hallmark of a Temple education.

====The Owl====

The owl has been the symbol and mascot for Temple University since its founding in the 1880s, making it the first school in the United States to adopt the owl as its symbol. The nocturnal hunter symbolized Temple&#x27;s early mission as a night school for ambitious young people of limited means. Russell Conwell encouraged these students, saying, &quot;The owl of the night makes the eagle of the day.&quot; In addition to being a universal symbol for wisdom and knowledge, the owl was the symbol of Athena, Greek goddess of wisdom and warfare. Due to this, the owl was decided to be a suitable mascot for not only the university as a center of learning, but for the athletic teams as well.

In 1977, Temple introduced &quot;Victor T. Owl&quot;, a costumed mascot, which was then renamed Hooter in 1984, and has remained Temple&#x27;s mascot at sports games and events since. Stella, Temple&#x27;s live owl mascot, was hatched in 2009 in Washington State and raised by a master falconer. She arrived in Pennsylvania in 2011 and lives in the Elmwood Park Zoo in Norristown, Pennsylvania. Stella is one of two live owl mascots in Division I athletics, the other being Florida Atlantic University&#x27;s Hera. Temple University is one of three schools in the American Athletic Conference to use the owl as a mascot, alongside Florida Atlantic University and Rice University.

Formed in 1997, TUGSA is a union that advocates for graduate students that are employed by the university as teaching or research assistants.

====Main Campus Program Board====

A staff of 25 plus more than 150 writers design, report and edit the 20-page paper. In 2008, the paper&#x27;s Web site, temple-news.com, received the National Online Pacemaker Award from the Associated Collegiate Press. In 2015, the paper also won the print counterpart, the National Pacemaker Award. In 2009, the paper&#x27;s staff won eight Keystone Press Awards. &quot;Templar&quot;, Temple University&#x27;s annual undergraduate yearbook, was created in 1924. During 2017, the yearbook received a national second-place award from the American Scholastic Press Association. WHIP, an acronym that stands for We Have Infinite Potential, is Temple University&#x27;s student radio station. It started broadcasting using Carrier Current in the Student Center before moving its studios to the TECH center. WHIP also gets increased visibility in a top-five media market as one of iHeartRadio&#x27;s top college radio stations. Temple also has TUTV, a digital cable station that broadcasts to Philadelphia. TUTV features programs from Klein College School of Media and Communication, other colleges and schools at Temple, community and professional broadcasting partners.

==Athletics==

Temple University&#x27;s sports teams are the Owls: a name born from Temple&#x27;s early days when it was a night school. The sports teams all participate in the NCAA&#x27;s Division I and the American Athletic Conference (The American). The Owls moved after spending the previous 31 years in the Atlantic 10 Conference (A-10). The field hockey team are affiliate members of the Big East Conference. The Owls are also part of the Philadelphia Big 5, the Philadelphia-area basketball rivalry. Temple University was among the first institutions in the United States to sponsor extracurricular athletic activities for its students when both the football and basketball programs were inaugurated in 1894 under the direction of Coach Charles M. Williams.

===Football===

Temple&#x27;s football program dates back to 1894 and currently plays Division I FBS football in the American Athletic Conference.

On December 17, 2012, Matt Rhule [pronounced rule] was named Temple&#x27;s 26th head football coach. He had most recently served as the assistant offensive line coach with the New York Giants. Rhule was an assistant coach for the Owls for six seasons, ending in 2010–11 when the program went 9–4 and played in the fourth bowl game in school history, the Gildan New Mexico Bowl, where the Owls defeated Wyoming, 37–15 – Temple&#x27;s first postseason victory since the 1979 Garden State Bowl. In 2015, they posted a school-record-tying 10 wins and 4 losses.

Temple posted another 10-4 record in 2016, when they won the 2016 American Athletic Conference Football Championship Game to secure its first conference championship since 1967. On December 13, 2016, Geoff Collins was named Temple&#x27;s 27th head football coach. Before taking the position, Collins had served as defensive coordinator for the University of Florida Gators that ranked among the nation&#x27;s best during his two seasons on staff. Collins took the Temple Owls to the Bad Boy Mowers Gasporilla Bowl in 2017 in which the Owls defeated the Florida International Golden Panthers 28 to 3.

The team is currently coached by Stan Drayton.

===Men&#x27;s basketball===
The Temple Men&#x27;s basketball program was ranked fifth in all-time NCAA wins with 1,903 starting the 2017–2018 season. Only Kentucky, Kansas, North Carolina, and Duke have a higher total.

Temple is recognized as having won the first-ever National Collegiate basketball championship in 1938, under Coach James Usilton. That Owls team, which finished with a 23–2 record, won the inaugural National Invitation Tournament by routing Colorado, 60–36, in the championship final. Because the NCAA Tournament was not held until the following year, Temple&#x27;s NIT championship earned the Owls the first national college basketball title. During the 1950s, the Temple basketball team made two NCAA Final Four appearances (1956 and 1958) under Head Coach Harry Litwack. Litwack would be inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame after concluding a 21-year coaching career that included 373 wins.

Head Coach John Chaney, who is also a Hall of Fame coach, won a total of 724 career games and took Temple to the NCAA tournament 17 times. His 1987–88 Owls team entered the NCAA tournament ranked No. 1 in the country, and he has reached the Elite Eight on five occasions. He was consensus national coach of the year in 1988.

On April 10, 2006, University of Pennsylvania head coach and La Salle University alumnus Fran Dunphy was named the new Temple&#x27;s men&#x27;s head basketball coach after Chaney&#x27;s retirement in conclusion of the 2006 season. Dunphy had coached the Quakers for 17 straight seasons prior to the move. Dunphy and the Owls won three straight Atlantic-10 tournaments in 2008, 2009 and 2010, with the third marking a conference-leading ninth A-10 title. In the 2011–12 season, the Owls won the A-10 regular season title.

The team is currently coached by Adam Fisher.

==Alumni and faculty==
There are more than 365,000 Temple alumni currently living in 50 states and 152 countries. As of 2024, the university&#x27;s alumni include a Rhodes Scholar, five Marshall Scholars, and many Fulbright Scholars. Temple has many notable alumni, such as Bill Cosby, Bob Saget, Daryl Hall, John Oates, Irvin Kershner, Diplo, and Karen Patricia Williams (women&#x27;s cancer prevention). Temple University employs over 3,100 educators and has a student to faculty ratio of 14:1.

<text>The Volvo Duett is an automobile from Volvo that was in production from 1953 until 1969.

The name &quot;Duett&quot; was intended to signify a car that could be used as a delivery vehicle during the week and as a comfortable sedan away from work.

The Duett was produced in three body styles: an estate car (or station wagon), a panel van, and, in small numbers, a bare chassis with no body from the windshield rearward.

==Ladder frame design==
The design is based on the Volvo PV sedan and shares its engine and front suspension with that model. However, unlike the PV, which had a unibody design and a coil spring rear suspension, the Duett used a ladder frame with leaf springs supporting the rear.
While the Duett has been criticised as a regressive design by those who point out that the ladder-frame car was based on Volvo&#x27;s first unibodied car; the use of a separate ladder chassis provided Volvo with an easy solution in their desire to produce a suitable commercial vehicle. The availability of the bare chassis also allowed Swedish coach builders such as Grip, Valbo and Nordbergs to build Duett-based pickup trucks, convertibles and specialised commercial vehicles. The versatility of the ladder-frame design also made the Duett a popular choice as a base for customised vehicles such as hot rods and .

The Duett was the only automobile marketed by Volvo in the United States that used a separate frame. All other models were of unibody construction.

==Model designations==

===PV445===
The PV445″s bodywork was based on the PV444 saloon car and shared its two-piece flat paned windshield.

===P210===
The P210 replaced the P445 in the fall of 1960. It is most easily distinguishable from the PV445 by its use of a single-piece curved windshield, which it shares with the PV544.

==Demise and replacement==
The final P210 rolled off the line in 1969, four years after the end of production of the PV544 on which it was based. The Duett was replaced by the Volvo 145 Express, a more modern design by Jan Wilsgaard which is an evolutionary advancement from his earlier work on the platform of the Volvo Amazon and it is unrelated to the Duett in terms of its engineering.

<doc id="239932" wikidata="Q268534" url="?curid=239932" title="Flush toilet">
<text>A flush toilet (also known as a flushing toilet, water closet (WC); see also toilet names) is a toilet that disposes of human waste (i.e., urine and feces) by collecting it in a bowl and then using the force of water to channel it (&quot;flush&quot; it) through a to another location for treatment, either nearby or at a communal facility. Flush toilets can be designed for sitting or squatting (often regionally differentiated). Most modern sewage treatment systems are also designed to process specially designed toilet paper, and there is increasing interest for flushable wet wipes. Porcelain (sometimes with vitreous china) is a popular material for these toilets, although public or institutional ones may be metal, etc.

Flush toilets are a type of plumbing fixture, and usually incorporate a bend called a &quot;trap&quot; (S-, U-, J-, or P-shaped) that causes water to collect in the toilet bowl – to hold the waste and act as a seal against noxious sewer gases. Urban and suburban flush toilets are connected to a sewerage system that conveys wastewater to a sewage treatment plant; rurally, a septic tank or composting system is mostly used.

The opposite of a flush toilet is a dry toilet, which uses no water for flushing. Associated devices are urinals, which primarily dispose of urine, and bidets, which use water to cleanse the anus, perineum, and vulva after using the toilet. 

==Operation==

A typical flush toilet is a fixed, vitreous ceramic bowl (also known as a pan) which is connected to a drain. After use, the bowl is emptied and cleaned by the rapid flow of water into the bowl. This flush may flow from a dedicated tank (cistern), a high-pressure water pipe controlled by a flush valve, or by manually pouring water into the bowl. Tanks and valves are normally operated by the user, by pressing a button, pushing down on a handle, pulling a lever or pulling a chain. The water is directed around the bowl by a molded flushing rim around the top of the bowl or by one or more jets, so that the entire internal surface of the bowl is rinsed with water.

===Mechanical flush from a cistern===
A typical toilet has a tank fixed above the bowl which contains a fixed volume of water, and two devices. The first device allows part of the contents of the tank (usually in the range) to be discharged rapidly into the toilet bowl, causing the contents of the bowl to be swept or sucked out of the toilet and into the drain, when the user operates the flush. The second device automatically allows water to enter the tank until the water level is appropriate for a flush.

The water may be discharged through a &quot;toilet flapper valve&quot; (not to be confused with a type of check valve), or through a siphon. A float usually controls the refilling device.

=== Mechanical flush from a high-pressure water supply ===
Toilets without cisterns are often flushed through a simple flush valve or &quot;Flushometer&quot; connected directly to the water supply. These are designed to rapidly discharge a limited volume of water when the lever or button is pressed then released.

===Manual flush (pour flush)===

A toilet does not need be connected to a water supply, but may be pour-flushed. This type of flush toilet has no cistern or permanent water supply, but is flushed by pouring in a few litres of water from a container. The flushing can use as little as . This type of toilet is common in many Asian countries. The toilet can be connected to one or two pits, in which case it is called a &quot;pour flush pit latrine&quot; or a &quot;twin pit pour flush pit latrine&quot;. It can also be connected to a septic tank.

===Vacuum toilet===

A vacuum toilet is a flush toilet that is connected to a vacuum sewer system, and removes waste by suction. They may use very little water (less than per flush) or none. Some flush with coloured disinfectant solution rather than with water. They may be used to separate blackwater and greywater, and process them separately (for instance, the fairly dry blackwater can be used for biogas production, or in a composting toilet).

Passenger train toilets, aircraft lavatories, bus toilets, and ships with plumbing often use vacuum toilets. The lower water usage saves weight and avoids water slopping out of the toilet bowl in motion. Aboard vehicles, a portable collection chamber is used; if it is filled by positive pressure from an intermediate vacuum chamber, it need not be kept under vacuum.

==Flushing systems==
The flushing system provides a large flow of water into the bowl. They normally take the form of either fixed tanks of water or flush valves.

=== Flush tanks ===
Flush tanks or cisterns usually incorporate a mechanism to release water from the tank and an automatic valve to allow the cistern to be refilled automatically.

This system is suitable for locations plumbed with water pipes which cannot supply water quickly enough to flush the toilet; the tank is needed to supply a large volume of water in a short time. The tank typically collects between of water over a period of time. In modern installations the storage tank is usually mounted directly above and behind the bowl.

Older installations, known as &quot;high suite combinations&quot;, used a high-level cistern (tank), fitted above head height, activated by a pull chain connected to a flush lever on the cistern. When more modern close-coupled cistern and bowl combinations were first introduced, these were first referred to as &quot;low suite combinations&quot;. Modern versions have a neater-looking low-level cistern with a lever that the user can reach directly, or a close-coupled cistern that is even lower down and fixed directly to the bowl. In recent decades the close coupled tank–bowl combination has become the most popular residential system, as it has been found by ceramic engineers that improved waterway design is a more effective way to enhance the bowl&#x27;s flushing action than high tank mounting.

====Tank fill valve====

Tank fill valves are found in all tank-style toilets. The valves are of two main designs: the side-float design and the concentric-float design. The side-float design has existed for over a hundred years. The concentric design has only existed since 1957 but is gradually becoming more popular than the side-float design.

The side-float design uses a float on the end of a lever to control the fill valve. The float is usually shaped like a ball, so the mechanism is often called a ball-valve or a ballcock (cock in this context is an alternative term for valve; see, for example, stopcock). Historically floats were made from copper sheet, but are now usually plastic. The float is located to one side of the main valve tower or inlet at the end of a rod or arm. As the float rises, so does the float-arm. The arm connects to the fill valve that shuts off the inflow of water when the float reaches a level at which the volume of water in the tank is sufficient to provide another flush.
The newer concentric-float fill valve consists of a tower which is encircled by a plastic float assembly. Operation is otherwise the same as a side-float fill valve, even though the float position is somewhat different. By virtue of its more compact layout, interference between the float and other obstacles (tank insulation, flush valve, and so on) is greatly reduced, thus increasing reliability. The concentric-float fill valve is also designed to signal to users automatically when there is a leak in the tank, by making much more noise when a leak is present than the older style side-float fill valve, which tends to be nearly silent when a slow leak is present.

Newer fill valves have a delayed action that will not start filling the tank/cistern until the flapper/drop valve has closed which saves some water.

====Flapper-flush valve or drop valve====

In tanks using a flapper-flush valve, the outlet at the bottom of the tank is covered by a buoyant (plastic or rubber) cover, or flapper, which is held in place against a fitting (the &quot;flush valve seat&quot;) by water pressure. The user pushes a lever to flush the toilet, which lifts the flush valve from the valve seat. The valve then floats clear of the seat, allowing the tank to empty quickly into the bowl. As the water level drops, the floating flush valve descends back to the bottom of the tank and covers the outlet pipe again. This system is common in homes in North America and in continental Europe. From 2001, due to a change in regulations, this flush system has also become available in the UK, where prior to that the siphon-type flush was mandated.

Dual flush versions of this design with push buttons are widely available. They have one level of water for liquid waste and a higher level for solid waste.

In North America, newer toilets have a flapper-flush valve. Older toilets have a flapper-flush valve. The larger flapper-flush valve is used on toilets that use less water, such as per flush. Some have a bell inlet for a faster more effective flush.

A problem with the valve type flush mechanism is that it invariably starts to leak after a couple of years use due to wear and tear of the valve, particles, etc. trapped in the valve. Quite often this leakage is barely noticeable but adds up to a considerable water wastage. In the UK it has been found that between 5 and 8% of toilets (mostly dual flush drop valves) are leaking, each one between on average per day. Whilst they save more water than they leak, regular maintenance or use of a non-leaking flush mechanism will maximise water savings.

====Siphon-flush mechanism====

This system, invented by Albert Giblin and common in the UK, uses a storage tank similar to that used in the flapper-flush-valve system above. This flush valve system is sometimes referred to as a &quot;valveless&quot; system, since no valve as such is required.

The siphon is formed of a vertical pipe that links the flush pipe to a domed chamber inside the cistern. A perforated disc, covered by a flexible plate or flap, is fitted inside this chamber and is joined by a rod to the flush lever.

Pressing the lever raises the disc, forces water over the top of the siphon into the vertical pipe, and starts the siphonic flow. Water flows through the perforated disc past the flap until the cistern is empty, at which point air enters the siphon and the flush stops.

The advantage of a siphon over the flush valve is that it has no sealing washers that can wear out and cause leaks, whereas other valve types - flapper, drop valve do leak, invariably after a couple of years of use and they have reduced water savings due to the valves not being maintained in practice. The siphon membrane will require occasional replacement.

Until 1 January 2001, the use of siphon-type cisterns was mandatory in the UK but after that date the regulations additionally allowed pressure flushing cisterns and pressure flushing valves (though the latter remained forbidden in houses). Siphons can sometimes be more difficult to operate than a &quot;flapper&quot;-based flush valve because moving the lever requires more torque than a flapper system. This additional torque is required because a certain amount of water must be lifted up into the siphon passageway in order to initiate the siphon action in the tank. Splitting or jamming of the flexible flap covering the perforated disc can cause the cistern to stop working.

Dual-flush versions of the siphon cistern provide a shorter flush option by allowing air into the siphon to stop the siphon action before the tank is empty.

The siphon system can also be combined with an air box to allow multiple siphons to be installed in a single trough cistern.

====High-pressure or pressure-assisted tanks====
Pressure-assisted toilets are sometimes found in both private (single, multiple, and lodging) installations as well as light commercial installations (such as offices). Products from several companies use per flush.

The mechanism consists of a plastic tank hidden inside the typical ceramic cistern or an exposed metal tank/cistern.
When the tank fills with water, the air trapped inside compresses. When the air pressure inside the plastic tank reaches a certain level, the tank stops filling with water. A high-pressure valve located in the center of the vessel holds the air and water inside until the user flushes the toilet.

During flushing, the user activates the valve via a button or lever, which releases the pressurized water into the bowl at a flow rate much higher than a conventional gravity-flow toilet. One advantage to this is lower water consumption than a gravity-flow toilet, or more effectiveness with a similar amount of water. As a result, the toilet does not clog as easily as those using non-pressurized mechanisms.

However, there are some financial and safety disadvantages. These toilets are generally more expensive to purchase, and the plastic tanks need to be replaced about every 10 years. They also have a noisier flush than other models. In addition, pressure-assisted tanks have been known to explode, causing serious injuries and property damage, resulting in a massive recall beginning in 2012 of over 1.4 million toilets equipped with the tank.

Some newer toilets use similar pressure-assist technology, along with a bowl and trapway designed to enhance the siphon effect; they use only per flush, or / for dual flush models. This design is also much quieter than other pressure-assist or flushometer toilets.

====Tipping bucket type valve====
A number of tipping bucket type cisterns have been developed. In the cistern is placed a tipping bucket with its axis aligned or perpendicular with the cistern. They have a lever which is rotated emptying the bucket which allows a variable flush. Usually the quantity of water is marked on the cistern and depending on the performance of the bowl a dual flush can be achieved e.g. ,  L (), , , etc. A normal or delayed action refill valve is used.

===Tankless style with high-pressure (flushometer) valve===

In 1906, William Sloan first made available his &quot;flushometer&quot; style toilet flush valve, incorporating his patented design. The design proved to be very popular and efficient and remains so to this day. Flushometer toilet flush valves are still often installed in commercial restrooms, and are frequently used for both toilets and urinals. Since they have no tank, they have no fill delay and can be used again immediately. They can be easily identified by their distinctive chrome pipe-work, and by the absence of a toilet tank or cistern, wherever they are employed.

Some flushometer models require the user to either depress a lever or press a button, which in turn opens a flush valve allowing mains-pressure water to flow directly into the toilet bowl or urinal. Other flushometer models are electronically triggered, using an infrared sensor to initiate the flushing process. Typically, on electronically triggered models, an override button is provided in case the user wishes to manually trigger flushing earlier. Some electronically triggered models also incorporate a true mechanical manual override which can be used in the event of the failure of the electronic system. In retrofit installations, a self-contained battery-powered or hard-wired unit can be added to an existing manual flushometer to flush automatically when a user departs.

Once a flushometer valve has been flushed, and after a preset interval, the flushometer mechanism closes the valve and stops the flow. The flushometer system requires no storage tank, but uses a high rate of water flow for a very short time. Thus a 22-mm/-inch pipe at minimum, or preferably a 29-mm/1-inch pipe, must be used. Water main pressures must be above . The higher water pressure employed by a flushometer valve scours the bowl more efficiently than a gravity-driven system, and fewer blockages typically occur as a result of this higher water pressure. Flushometer systems require approximately the same amount of water as a gravity system to operate.

==Bowl design==
The &quot;bowl&quot; or &quot;pan&quot; of a toilet is the receptacle that receives bodily waste. A toilet bowl is most often made of a ceramic, but can sometimes be made of stainless steel or composite plastics. Toilet bowls are mounted in any one of three basic manners: above-floor mounted (pedestal), wall mounted (cantilever), or in-floor mounted (squat toilet).

Within the bowl, there are three main waterway design systems: the siphoning trapped system (found primarily in North American residential installations, and in North American light commercial installations), the non-siphoning trapped system (found in most other installations), and the valve-closet system (found in trains, passenger aircraft, buses, and other such installations around the world). Older style toilets called &quot;washout&quot; toilets are now only found in a few locations.

=== Siphonic bowls ===

====Single trap siphonic toilet====

The siphonic toilet, also called &quot;siphon jet&quot; and &quot;siphon wash&quot;, is perhaps the most popular design in North America for residential and light commercial toilet installations. All siphonic toilets incorporate an S-shaped waterway.

Standing water in the bowl acts as a barrier to sewer gas coming out of the sewer through the drain, and also as a receptacle for waste. Sewer gas is vented through a separate vent pipe attached to the sewer line. The water in the toilet bowl is connected to the drain by a drainpipe shaped like an extended &quot;S&quot; which curves up behind the bowl and down to the drain. The portion of the channel behind the bowl is arranged as a siphon tube, whose length is greater than the depth of the water in the bowl. The top of the curving tube limits the height of the water in the bowl before it flows down the drain. The waterways in these toilets are designed with slightly smaller diameters than a non-siphonic toilet, so that the waterway will naturally fill up with water each time it is flushed, creating the siphon action.

At the top of the toilet bowl is a rim with many angled drain holes that are fed from the tank, which fill, rinse, and induce swirling in the bowl when it is flushed. Some designs use a large hole in the front of the rim to allow faster filling of the bowl. There may also be a siphon jet hole about diameter in the bottom of the toilet bowl trap.

If the toilet is flushed from a tank, a large holding cistern is mounted above the toilet, containing approximately of water in modern designs. This tank is built with a large drain diameter hole at its bottom covered by a flapper valve that allows the water to rapidly leave the holding tank when the flush is activated. Alternatively, water may be supplied directly via a flush valve or &quot;flushometer&quot;.

The rapid influx of water into the bowl causes the standing water in the bowl to rise and fill the S-shaped siphon tube mounted in the back of the toilet. This starts the toilet&#x27;s siphonic action. The siphon action quickly &quot;pulls&quot; nearly all of the water and waste in the bowl and the on-rushing tank water down the drain in about 4–7 seconds —it flushes. When most of the water has drained out of the bowl, the continuous column of water through the siphon is broken when air enters the siphon tube. The toilet then gives its characteristic gurgle as the siphonic action ceases and no more water flows out of the toilet.

A &quot;true siphonic toilet&quot; can be easily identified by the noise it makes. If it can be heard to suck air down the drain at the end of a flush, then it is a true siphonic toilet. If not, then it is either a double trap siphonic or a non-siphonic toilet.

If water is poured slowly into the bowl it simply flows over the rim of the waterway and pours slowly down the drain—thus the toilet does not flush properly.

After flushing, the flapper valve in the water tank closes or the flush valve shuts; water lines and valves connected to the water supply refill the toilet tank and bowl. Then the toilet is again ready for use.

If the forward (&quot;flush&quot;) jet connection to the upper inlet in the toilet clogs, poor or no flushing action may result. 

====Double trap siphonic toilet====

The double trap siphonic toilet is a less common type that is exceptionally quiet when flushed. A device known as an aspirator uses the flow of water in a flush to pull air from the cavity between the two traps, reducing the air pressure inside and creating a siphon which pulls water and waste from the toilet bowl. Towards the end of the flush cycle the aspirator ceases being immersed in water, thus allowing air to enter the cavity between the traps and break the siphon, without the gurgling noise, while the final flush water fills the pan.

=== Non-siphonic bowls ===

==== Washdown toilet ====
Washdown toilets are the most common form of pedestal and cantilever toilets outside the Americas. The bowl has a large opening at the top which tapers down to a water trap at the base. It is flushed from the top by water discharged through a flushing rim or jets. The force of the water flowing into the bowl washes the waste through the trap and into the drains.

Washdown bowls developed from earlier &quot;hopper&quot; closets, which were simple conical bowls connected to a drain. However, waste is typically excreted towards the back of the toilet, rather than the exact center, and the backs of the hoppers were prone to becoming soiled. The modern washdown bowl has a steeply sloping back and a more gently sloping or curving front, so the water trap is off-center, towards the rear of the toilet. With this &quot;eccentric cone&quot; design, most waste drops into the pool of water at the base of the bowl, rather than onto the surface of the toilet. Early washdown closets had a large water area at the base to minimize soiling, which required a large volume of water to clear them effectively. Modern bowls have a smaller area, which reduces the volume of water needed to flush them; however, that water area is always small compared to the water area of a typical North American siphonic bowl, and this makes the washdown bowl prone to soiling.

====Washout toilet====
Washout, or &quot;Flachspüler&quot; (&quot;shallow flush&quot;), toilets have a flat platform with a shallow pool of water. They are flushed by a jet of water from the back that drives waste into the trap below. From there, the water flow removes it into the sewage system. An advantage of the design is that users will not get splashed from below. Taking of stool samples is also simplified. Washout toilets have a shallow pool of water into which waste is deposited, with a trapped drain just behind this pool. Waste is cleared out from this pool of water by being swept over into the trap (usually either a P-trap or an S-trap) and then beyond into a sewer by water from the flush. Washout pans were among the first types of ceramic toilets invented and since the early 1970s are now only found in a decreasing number of localities in Europe. A washout toilet is a kind of flush toilet which was once predominantly used in Germany, Austria and France. It was patented in Britain by George Jennings in 1852 and remained the standard toilet type in Britain throughout the 19th century.

Examples of this type of toilet can be found in Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, and some regions of Poland, although it is becoming less common.

One disadvantage of this design is that it may require the more intense use of a toilet brush to remove bits of feces that may have left marks on the shelf. Additionally, this design presents the disadvantage of creating a strong lingering odor since the feces are not submerged in water immediately after excretion.

==== Squat toilet ====
In many parts of Asia, people traditionally use the toilet in a squatting position. This applies to defecation and urination by males and females. Therefore, homes and public washrooms have squat toilets, with the toilet bowl installed in the floor. This has the advantages of not needing an additional toilet seat and also being more convenient for cultures where people use water to wash their genitals instead of toilet paper. However, Western-style toilets that are mounted at sitting height and have a plastic seat have become popular as well. Many public washrooms have both squatting and sitting toilets.

In Western countries, instructions have been put up in some public toilets used by people accustomed to squat toilets, on the correct use of a sitting-style toilet. This is to avoid breaking the toilet or seat if someone attempts to squat on the edges.

The &quot;Anglo-Indian&quot; design used in India allows the same toilet to be used in the sitting or the squatting position.

===Valve closet===
The valve closet has a valve or flap at the exit of the bowl, often with a watertight seal to retain a pool of water in the pan. When the toilet is flushed, the valve is opened and the water in the pan flows rapidly out of the bowl into the drains, carrying the waste with it.

The earliest type of toilet, the valve closet is now rarely used for water-flush toilet systems. More complicated in design than other toilets, this design has lower reliability and is more difficult to maintain or repair. The most common use for valve closets is now in portable closets for caravans, camping, trains, and aircraft, where the flushing fluid is recycled. This design is also used in train carriages for use in areas where the waste is allowed to be simply dumped between the tracks (the flushing of such toilets is generally prohibited when the train is in a station).

Simple valve closets are used on most older style Russian trains, made in Eastern Germany ( factory, design dated probably to the 1950s), employing a pan-like shutter valve at the base of the pan and discharging waste directly onto the trackbed below. Usage of this type of toilet is permitted only while the train is moving, and outside of major cities. These designs are being phased out, together with the old trains, and are being replaced with modern vacuum systems.

The British singer Ian Wallace composed and performed the humorous song &quot;Never Do It at the Station&quot;, which mentioned the old-fashioned trackbed dumping toilets which were still in use during the mid-20th century in Britain. The song first advised frugal travelers to save money by avoiding pay toilets in train stations, but also reminded polite passengers not to use the onboard &quot;loo&quot; while the train was stopped at a station.

==Low-flow and high-efficiency flush toilets==

Since 1994, there is a significant move towards using less water for flushing toilets. This has resulted in the emergence of low flush toilet designs and local or national standards on water consumption for flushing. As an alternative some people modify an existing high flush toilet to use less water by placing a brick or water bottle into the toilet&#x27;s water tank. Other modifications are often done on the water system itself (such as by using greywater), or a system that pollutes the water less, for more efficient water use.

Urine diversion flush toilets, which were developed in Sweden, save water by using less water, or even no water, for the urine flush compared to about the feces flush.

===US standards for new toilets===
Pre-1994 residential and pre-1997 commercial flush toilets in the United States typically used of water per flush (gpf or lpf). The United States Congress passed the Energy Policy Act of 1992, which mandated that from 1994 common flush toilets use only . In response to the Act, manufacturers produced &quot;low-flow&quot; toilets, which many consumers did not like because they often required more than one flush to remove solids. People unhappy with the reduced performance of the low-flow toilets resorted to driving across the border to Canada or Mexico or buying salvaged toilets from older buildings. Manufacturers responded to consumers&#x27; complaints by improving the toilets. The improved products are generally identified as &quot;high efficiency toilets&quot; or HETs. HETs possess an effective flush volume of or less. They may be &quot;single-flush&quot; or &quot;dual-flush&quot;. A dual-flush toilet permits selection between different amounts of water for solid or liquid waste. Some HETs are &quot;pressure-assisted&quot; (or power, pump, or vacuum assisted).

The performance of a flush-toilet may be rated by a Maximum Performance (MaP) score. The low end of MaP scores is 250 (250 grams of simulated fecal matter). The high end of MaP scores is 1,000. A toilet with a MaP score of 1,000 should provide trouble-free service. It should remove all waste with a single flush; it should not plug; it should not harbor any odor; it should be easy to keep clean. The United States Environmental Protection Agency uses a MaP score of 350 as the minimum performance threshold for HETs. 1.6 gpf toilets are also sometimes referred as Ultra Low Flow (ULF).

Methods used to make up for the inadequacies of low flow toilets include using thinner toilet paper, plungers, and adding extra cups of water to the bowl manually.

==Maintenance and hygiene==

===Clogging===
If clogging occurs, it is usually the result of an attempt to flush unsuitable items, or as feces size often increases with age or too much toilet paper. Clogging can occur spontaneously due to limescale fouling of the drain pipe, or by overloading the stool capacity of the toilet. Stool capacity varies among toilet designs and is based on the size of the drainage pipe, the capacity of the water tank, the velocity of a flush, and the method by which the water attempts to vacate the bowl of its contents. The size and consistency of the stool is a hard-to-predict contributory factor.

In some countries, clogging has become more frequent due to regulations that require the use of small-tanked low-flush toilets in attempt to conserve water. Designs which increase the velocity of flushed water or improve the travel path can improve low-flow reliability.

Partial clogging is particularly insidious, as it is usually not discovered immediately, but only later by an unsuspecting user trying to flush an incompletely emptied toilet. Overflowing of the water mixed with excrement may then occur, depending on the bowl volume, tank capacity and severity of clogging. For this reason, rooms with flush toilets may be designed as wet rooms, with a second drain on the floor, and a shower head capable of reaching the whole floor area. Common means to remedy clogging include use of a toilet plunger, drain cleaner, or a plumber&#x27;s snake.

===Aerosols===

A &quot;toilet plume&quot; is the dispersal of microscopic particles into the air as a result of flushing a toilet. Normal use of a toilet by healthy people is considered unlikely to be a major health risk. There is indirect evidence that specific pathogens such as norovirus or SARS coronavirus could potentially be spread through toilet aerosols, but as of 2015 no direct experimental studies had clearly demonstrated or refuted actual disease transmission from toilet aerosols. It has been hypothesized that dispersal of pathogens may be reduced by closing the toilet lid before flushing, and by using toilets with lower flush energy.

==History==
===Pre-modern flush toilet systems===
Forms of water flushed latrines have been found to exist since the Neolithic period. The Mesopotamians introduced the world to clay sewer pipes around 4000 BCE, with the earliest examples found in the Temple of Bel at Nippur and at Eshnunna, utilised to remove wastewater from sites, and capture rainwater, in wells. The city of Uruk hosts the earliest known examples of brick constructed Latrines, both squat and pedestal, from 3200 BCE. Clay pipes were later used in the Hittite city of Hattusa. They had easily detachable and replaceable segments, and allowed for cleaning.

Flushed toilet systems were constructed by people of the Indus Civilization at some places, and later Egyptians and the Minoan civilization did so next, while the latter developed by the second millennium BC flushable pedestal toilets, with examples excavated at Knossos and Akrotiri.

The oldest neolithic village in Britain, dating from circa 31st century BC, Skara Brae, Orkney, used a form of hydraulic technology for sanitation. The village&#x27;s design used a stream, and connecting drainage system to wash waste away.

Communal latrines were in use throughout the Roman Empire, feeding into either primary or secondary sewers, from the first through fifth centuries AD. A very well-preserved example are the latrines at Housesteads on Hadrian&#x27;s Wall in Britain. Such toilets did not flush in the modern sense, but had a continuous stream of running water to wash away waste. With the fall of the Western Roman Empire, these communal toilet systems fell into disuse in Western Europe, though continued in the Eastern Byzantine Roman Empire, with records of toilet pipes being renewed, and sewers repaired.

In February 2023 archeologists in China announced the discovery of the remains of what may be the world&#x27;s oldest known flush toilet. Broken parts of the 2,400-year-old lavatory, as well as a bent flush pipe, were unearthed among ancient palace ruins in the Yueyang archaeological site in the central city of Xi&#x27;an by researchers from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences&#x27; Institute of Archeology.

=== Development of the modern flush toilet ===

In 1596 Sir John Harington (1561–1612) published &quot;A New Discourse of a Stale Subject, Called the Metamorphosis of Ajax&quot;, describing a forerunner to the modern flush toilet installed at his house at Kelston in Somerset. The design had a flush valve to let water out of the tank, and a wash-down design to empty the bowl. He installed one for his godmother Queen Elizabeth I at Richmond Palace.

With the onset of the Industrial Revolution and related advances in technology, the flush toilet began to emerge into its modern form. A crucial advance in plumbing was the S-trap, invented by the Scottish mechanic Alexander Cumming in 1775, and still in use today. This device uses the standing water to seal the outlet of the bowl, preventing the escape of foul air from the sewer. His design had a sliding valve in the bowl outlet above the trap. Two years later, Samuel Prosser applied for a British patent for a &quot;plunger closet&quot;.
Prolific inventor Joseph Bramah began his professional career installing water closets (toilets) that were based on Alexander Cumming&#x27;s patented design of 1775. He found that the current model being installed in London houses had a tendency to freeze in cold weather. In collaboration with a Mr. Allen, he improved the design by replacing the usual slide valve with a hinged flap that sealed the bottom of the bowl.

He also developed a float valve system for the flush tank. Obtaining the patent for it in 1778, he began making toilets at a workshop in Denmark Street, St Giles. The design was arguably the first practical non-manual flush toilet, and production continued well into the 19th century, used mainly on boats. Thomas Bowdich, an English traveller, visited Kumasi, capital of the Ashanti Empire in 1817 and mentioned that majority of the houses in the city especially those near the king&#x27;s palace included indoor toilets that were flushed with gallons of boiling water.

=== Industrial production ===
It was only in the mid-19th century, with growing levels of urbanisation and industrial prosperity, that the flush toilet became a widely used and marketed invention. This period coincided with the dramatic growth in the sewage system, especially in London, which made the flush toilet particularly attractive for health and sanitation reasons.

George Jennings established a business manufacturing water closets, salt-glaze drainage, sanitary pipes and sanitaryware at Parkstone Pottery in the 1840s, where he popularized the flush toilet to the middle class. At The Great Exhibition at Hyde Park held from 1 May to 15 October 1851, George Jennings installed his Monkey Closets in the Retiring Rooms of The Crystal Palace. These were the first public pay toilets (free ones did not appear until later), and they caused great excitement. During the exhibition, 827,280 visitors paid one penny to use them; for the penny they got a clean seat, a towel, a comb, and a shoe shine. &quot;To spend a penny&quot; became a euphemism, for going to the toilet.
When the exhibition finished and moved to Sydenham, the toilets were to be closed down. However, Jennings persuaded the organisers to keep them open, and the toilet went on to earn over £1,000 a year. He opened the first underground convenience at the Royal Exchange in 1854. He received a patent in 1852 for an improved construction of water-closet, in which the pan and trap were constructed in the same piece, and so formed that there was always a small quantity of water retained in the pan itself, in addition to that in the trap which forms the water-joint. He also improved the construction of valves, drain traps, forcing pumps and pump-barrels. By the end of the 1850s building codes suggested that most new middle-class homes in British cities were equipped with a water closet.

Another pioneering manufacturer was Thomas William Twyford, who invented the single piece, ceramic flush toilet. The 1870s proved to be a defining period for the sanitary industry and the water closet; the debate between the simple water closet trap basin made entirely of earthenware and the very elaborate, complicated and expensive mechanical water closet would fall under public scrutiny and expert opinion. In 1875 the &quot;wash-out&quot; trap water closet was first sold, and was found as the public&#x27;s preference for basin type water closets. By 1879 Twyford had devised his own type of the &quot;wash out&quot; trap water closet; he titled it the &quot;National&quot;, and it became the most popular wash-out water closet.

By the 1880s the free-standing water closet was on sale and quickly gained popularity; the free-standing water closet was able to be cleaned more easily and was therefore a more hygienic water closet. Twyford&#x27;s &quot;Unitas&quot; model was free-standing and made completely of earthenware. Throughout the 1880s he submitted further patents for improvements to the flushing rim and the outlet. Finally, in 1888 he applied for a patent protection for his &quot;after flush&quot; chamber; the device allowed the basin to be refilled by a lower quantity of clean water in reserve after the water closet was flushed. The modern pedestal &quot;flush-down&quot; toilet was demonstrated by Frederick Humpherson of the Beaufort Works, Chelsea, England in 1885.

The leading companies of the period issued catalogues, established showrooms in department stores and marketed their products around the world. Twyford had showrooms for water closets in Berlin, Germany; Sydney, Australia; and Cape Town, South Africa. The Public Health Act 1875 set down stringent guidelines relating to sewers, drains, water supply and toilets and lent tacit government endorsement to the prominent water closet manufacturers of the day.

Contrary to popular legend, Sir Thomas Crapper did not invent the flush toilet. He was, however, in the forefront of the industry in the late 19th century, and held nine patents, three of them for water closet improvements such as the floating ballcock. In 1880, Thomas Crapper introduced the U-shaped trap. His flush toilets were designed by inventor Albert Giblin, who received a British patent for the &quot;Silent Valveless Water Waste Preventer&quot;, a siphon discharge system. Crapper popularized the siphon system for emptying the tank, replacing the earlier floating valve system which was prone to leaks.
Rev. Edward Johns, introduced his &quot;Dolphin toilet&quot; to the United States at the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, attributed to Edward Johns &amp; Co of Armitage, Staffordshire,&lt;ref name=&quot;leeds.gov.uk/IMG_20210721_134652.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/1992/01/23/english-bathrooms&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jldr/crapperloo&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;google/patent/GB528110&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;baus.org.uk/museum/164&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;The American slang term for the toilet, “the john,” is said to be derived from the flushing water closets at Harvard University installed in 1735, and emblazoned with the manufacturer’s name, Rev. Edward Johns.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;surfacesreporter/10241&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spread and further developments ===
Although flush toilets first appeared in Britain, they soon spread to the Continent. The first such examples may have been the three &quot;waterclosets&quot; installed in the new town house of banker &quot;Nicolay August Andresen&quot; on 6 Kirkegaten in Christiania, insured in January 1859. The toilets were probably imported from Britain, as they were referred to by the English term &quot;waterclosets&quot; in the insurance ledger. Another early watercloset on the European continent, dating from 1860, was imported from Britain to be installed in the rooms of Queen Victoria in Ehrenburg Palace (Coburg, Germany); she was the only one who was allowed to use it. Flush toilets were sold in Batavia, Dutch East Indies in 1872.

In America, the chain-pull indoor toilet was introduced in the homes of the wealthy and in hotels, soon after its invention in England in the 1880s. Flush toilets were introduced in the 1890s. William Elvis Sloan invented the Flushometer in 1906, which used pressurized water directly from the supply line for faster recycle time between flushes. The Flushometer is still in use today in public restrooms worldwide. The vortex-flushing toilet bowl, which creates a self-cleansing effect, was invented by Thomas MacAvity Stewart of Saint John, New Brunswick, in 1907. Philip Haas of Dayton, Ohio, made some significant developments, including the flush rim toilet with multiple jets of water from a ring and the water closet flushing and recycling mechanism similar to those in use today.

The company Caroma in Australia developed the Duoset cistern with two buttons and two flush volumes as a water-saving measure in 1980. Modern versions of the Duoset are now available worldwide, and save the average household 67% of their normal water usage.

==Manufacture==
A toilet&#x27;s body is typically made from vitreous china, which starts out as an aqueous suspension of various minerals called a slip. It takes about of slip to make a toilet.

In traditional casting, the slip is poured into the space between plaster of Paris molds. The toilet bowl, rim, tank and tank lid require separate molds. The molds are assembled and set up for filling and the slip-filled molds sit for about an hour after filling. This allows the plaster molds to absorb moisture from the slip, which makes it semi-solid next to the mold surfaces but lets it remain liquid further from the surface of the molds. Then, the workers remove plugs to allow any excess liquid slip to drain from the cavities of the mold (this excess slip is recycled for later use). The drained-out slip leaves hollow voids inside the fixture, using less material to keep it both lighter and easier to fire in a kiln. This molding process allows the formation of intricate internal waste lines in the fixture; the drain&#x27;s hollow cavities are poured out as slip.

At this point, the toilet parts without their molds look like and are about as strong as soft clay. After about one hour the top core mold (interior of toilet) is removed. The rim mold bottom (which includes a place to mount the holding tank) is removed, and it then has appropriate slanted holes for the rinsing jets cut, and the mounting holes for tank and seat are punched into the rim piece. Valve holes for rapid water entry into the toilet are cut into the rim pieces. The exposed top of the bowl piece is then covered with a thick slip and the still-uncured rim is attached on top of the bowl so that the bowl and hollow rim are now a single piece. The bowl plus rim is then inverted, and the toilet bowl is set upside down on the top rim mold to hold the pieces together as they dry. Later, all the rest of the mold pieces are removed. As the clay body dries further it hardens more and continues to shrink. After a few hours, the casting is self-supporting, and is called greenware.

After the molds are removed, workers use hand tools and sponges to smooth the edges and surface of the greenware, and to remove the mold joints or roughness: this process is called &quot;fettling&quot;. For large scale production pieces, these steps may be automated. The parts are then left outside or put in a warm room to dry, before going through a dryer at about , for about 20–36 hours.
After the surfaces are smoothed, the bowls and tanks are sprayed with glaze of various kinds to get different colors. This glaze is designed to shrink and contract at the same rate as the greenware while undergoing firing. After being sprayed with glaze, the toilet bowls, tanks, and lids are placed in stacks on a conveyor belt or &quot;car&quot; that slowly goes through a large kiln to be fired. The belt slowly moves the glaze-covered greenware into a tunnel kiln, which has different temperature zones inside it starting at about at the front, increasing towards the middle to over degrees, and exiting at about . During the firing in the kiln, the greenware and glaze are vitrified as one solid finished unit. Transiting the kiln takes glaze-covered greenware around 23–40 hours.

After the pieces are removed from the kiln and fully cooled, they are inspected for cracks or other defects. Then, the flushing mechanism may be installed on a one-piece toilet. On a two-piece toilet with a separate tank, the flushing mechanism may only be placed into the tank, with final assembly at installation.

A two-piece attaching seat and toilet bowl lid are typically mounted over the bowl to allow covering the toilet when it is not in use and to provide seating comfort. The seat may be installed at the factory, or the parts may be sold separately and assembled by a plumbing distributor or the installer.

==Water usage==
The amount of water used by conventional flush toilets is usually a significant portion of personal daily water usage: for example, five flushes per day use .

Modern low-flush toilet designs allow the use of much less water per flush, per flush.

Dual flush toilets allow the user to select between a flush for urine or feces, saving a significant amount of water over conventional units. Dual flush may be accomplished by pushing the flush handle up or down, or a two-segment flush pushbutton may be used whereby pressing the smaller section releases less water.

===Flushing with non-potable water sources===
Raw water flushing, including seawater flushing, is a method of water conservation, where raw water, such as seawater, is used for flush toilets. Such systems are used in places such as the majority of cities and towns in Hong Kong (see water supply and sanitation in Hong Kong), Gibraltar, and Avalon, California, United States. Heads (on ships) are typically flushed with seawater.

Flush toilets may, if plumbed for it, use greywater (water previously used for washing dishes, laundry and bathing) for flushing rather than drinkable potable water.

== Etymology ==
===Water closet===

The word &quot;toilet&quot; initially meant &quot;wash-room&quot;, without reference to sanitary facilities. Early indoor toilets were known as garderobes because they were used to store clothes, as the smell of ammonia was found to deter fleas and moths. However, an outhouse was usual until the nineteenth century, and only a few wealthy houses and luxury hotels had indoor toilets connected to drains and sewers. Lidded &quot;chamber pots&quot;, kept in specially designed bedside cabinets and used in bedrooms by ladies and invalids, and portable bathtubs, could be emptied and washed in an outhouse.

From the sixteenth century in England, a private room (a closet) with a flushing toilet was referred to as a Water Closet (&quot;WC&quot;), in contrast with an Earth Closet (&quot;EC&quot;), an abbreviation still used in 1960s Oxfordshire cottage sales.

The descriptive terms &quot;wash-down closet&quot; or &quot;water closet&quot; only reached the United States in the 1880s. By 1890 there was increased public awareness of disease and of carelessly disposed human waste being infectious.

In common North American usage, a residential &quot;bathroom&quot; usually contains a toilet, a lavatory, and a bath. However, a commercial bathroom (or “restroom”) contains toilets or urinals but no bath, to the confusion of foreigners. In the UK, Australia and NZ, &quot;bathroom&quot; or bath-room refers to a room with a fixed bathtub and not necessarily a toilet. The terms &quot;bathroom&quot;, and &quot;toilet&quot; or &quot;loo&quot; (amongst other euphemisms) indicate distinct functions, although bathrooms may often include toilets.

The term &quot;water closet&quot;, refers to a room that has both a toilet and other plumbing fixtures such as a sink or a bathtub. American plumbers and codes use the term &quot;water closet&quot; or &quot;WC&quot; to denote a small room or enclosure with a toilet which is usually located within a larger bathroom that contains other fixtures such as a sink and tub. 

Many European languages refer to a toilet as a &quot;water&quot; or &quot;WC&quot;. The Royal Spanish Academy Dictionary accepts &quot;váter&quot; as a name for a toilet or bathroom, which is derived from the British term &quot;water closet&quot;. France uses the expressions &quot;aller aux waters&quot; (&quot;to go to the waters&quot;) derived from &quot;water closet&quot;, and &quot;w.-c.&quot; . Likewise the Romanian word &quot;&quot;veceu&quot; , and the Finnish word &quot;vessa&quot; derive from a shortened version of the abbreviation. In German, the expression &quot;Klo&quot; (first syllable of &quot;Klosett&quot;&quot;) is used alongside &quot;WC&quot;. In Italian WC or , and &quot;water&quot; , are very common terms to refer to the flushing toilet. In Dutch WC is the most common term.

== Society and culture ==

=== Swirl direction myth ===
It is a common misconception that when flushed, the water in a toilet bowl swirls one way if the toilet is north of the equator and the other way if south of the equator, due to the Coriolis effect – usually, counter clockwise in the northern hemisphere, and clockwise in the southern hemisphere. In reality, the direction that the water takes is much more determined by the direction that the bowl&#x27;s rim jets are pointed, and it can be made to flush in either direction in either hemisphere by simply redirecting the rim jets during manufacture. The relative importance of the Coriolis force can be determined by a ratio known as the Rossby number. When this number is much larger than 1, the Coriolis force is insignificant compared to the inertia effects. On the scale of bathtubs and toilets, the Rossby number is on the order of billions, and so the Coriolis effect is too weak to be observed except under carefully controlled laboratory conditions.

=== Courtesy flush ===
Since the 1990s, the slang term &quot;courtesy flush&quot; refers to a mid-defecation flush of the toilet as a courtesy to other bathroom users or other prisoners in a cell. A courtesy flush can serve to reduce odor and cover noise.

== Geography ==
A part of the district is located in the Black Forest, other landscapes covered are the &quot;Oberes Gäu&quot; and the &quot;Schönbuch&quot;. The highest elevation is the 626 m high &quot;Kühlenberg&quot; in the municipality Jettingen; the lowest point, at 315 m, is in the valley of the Glems at the northern boundary of the district.

== Coat of arms ==

<doc id="239947" wikidata="Q236853" url="?curid=239947" title="Ludovico Sforza">
<text>Ludovico Maria Sforza (; 27 July 1452 – 27 May 1508), also known as Ludovico il Moro (; &#x27;the Moor&#x27;), and called the &quot;arbiter of Italy&quot; by historian Francesco Guicciardini, was an Italian nobleman who ruled as the Duke of Milan from 1494 to 1499.

Although he was the fourth son and excluded from his family&#x27;s succession, Ludovico was ambitious and managed to obtain dominion over Milan. He first assumed the regency from his sister-in-law Bona, then took over from his deceased nephew Gian Galeazzo, whom some say he poisoned. Considered enlightened, generous, and peaceful, he became a patron of artists and writers. His court in Milan became one of the most important in Europe during the Italian Renaissance.

Somewhat contrarily, Ludovico was also considered fearful and of a fickle nature. To face the threats of King Alfonso II of Naples, Ludovico called the French to Italy; when threatened by the French, he could not face the danger, and was saved only thanks to the intervention of his wife, Beatrice. When she died, he went into a depression and the state of his court fell from jubilance to despair. He finally succumbed to King of France Louis XII, who imprisoned him in France where he died.

==Early life==

===Childhood===
Ludovico Sforza was born on 3 August 1452 at Milan, in what is now Lombardy. His position as the fourth son of Francesco I Sforza and Bianca Maria Visconti meant that he was not expected to become ruler of Milan, but his mother still encouraged a broad education.

====Education====
Despite being a fourth-born son and therefore unlikely to rise to the position of duke, his mother, Bianca, wanted him to be well-educated. In the style of the Renaissance spirit, Ludovico received a varied education, especially in the field of classical readings. Under the tutelage of many teachers, including the humanist Francesco Filelfo and the poet Giorgio Valagussa, Ludovico received lessons in Greek, Latin, theology, painting, sculpture, as well as being instructed in matters of government and administration of the state. His tutelage also included physical exercise in the form of fencing, hunting, wrestling, horseback riding, jumping, dancing, and the game of ropeball.
Cicco Simonetta described him as the most well-versed and rapid learner among the children of Francesco Sforza, his father. His father and mother showed him particular attention, as evidenced by the extensive correspondence between them. At the age of seven, together with his mother and brothers, he welcomed Pope Pius II to Mantua on a visit to the city, marking Ludovico&#x27;s first public outing on an official occasion. At the age of eleven, he dedicated an oration in Latin to his father. Ludovico spent his childhood with his brothers and sisters in the Broletto Vecchio palace in Milan and in the Visconti Castle in Pavia.

====Under the rule of Galeazzo Maria====
When their father Francesco died in 1466, the family titles passed to Galeazzo Maria, the eldest brother. Ludovico was conferred the courtesy title of Count of Mortara.

Within ten days, Ludovico was in Cremona to keep the lands of the duchy united and encourage the inhabitants of the city to pay tributes of loyalty to the new duke.

He continued to deal with diplomatic missives, remaining in Cremona until the following year, when he went to Genoa to welcome his sister Ippolita, wife of Alfonso of Aragon. On 6 June 1468 he was again in Genoa to welcome Bona of Savoy and escorted her together with his brother Tristan to Milan where, on 7 July, her wedding with Duke Galeazzo Maria took place. He was later appointed as the ambassador to the King of France and then to Bologna. In January 1471 he went to Venice on behalf of the duke. He was able to improve diplomatic relations between the Duchy of Milan and the Republic of Venice by giving a speech which was well received by the doge. In March 1471 he accompanied Duke Galeazzo Maria on his journey to Florence, and in August of the same year to Rome for the coronation of Pope Sixtus IV. In September 1471 he journeyed to the court of Turin.

Duke Galeazzo Maria seemed to have a particular fondness for Ludovico. In 1471, the Duke established in his will that should he die without grandchildren, the Duchy of Milan would pass to Ludovico even before the other brothers. Ludovico hid the Duke&#x27;s well-known relationship with Lucia Marliani. A clear change occurred in 1476 when Ludovico was sent to France together with his brother Tristan in a sort of disguised exile. The Duke&#x27;s wife, Bona, accused the two of having plotted to assassinate the duke, only to deny the accusation once she had made peace with Ludovico. It is unknown whether this was the reason for that exile, because according to the official version of Galeazzo Maria, it was his own brothers who asked him for permission to &quot;go and see the world&quot;.

==Rise to power==
Duke Galeazzo Maria was assassinated on 26 December 1476, at the hands of several high-ranking officials in the Milanese court. He was succeeded by his son Gian Galeazzo Maria, then only seven years old. Upon hearing the news, Ludovico hastily returned from France. Together with two other brothers, Ascanio and Ottaviano, as well as the condottieri Roberto Sanseverino, Donato del Conte, and Ibletto Fieschi, Ludovico tried to oppose the regency of Bona, believing the duchy was in fact in the hands of the ducal councilor Cicco Simonetta. The attempt failed and Ludovico was exiled to Pisa, Sforza Maria to Bari, and Ascanio to Perugia. Octavian tried to wade across the Adda to escape and drowned. Roberto Sanseverino fled to France, Donato del Conte was imprisoned in Monza, and Ibletto Fieschi was imprisoned in the Castello Sforzesco.

In February 1479, Ludovico and Sforza Maria, supported by Ferrante of Aragon, entered the Republic of Genora with an army, where they joined Roberto Sanseverino and Ibletto Fieschi. The Duchess Bona and Cicco Simonetta convinced Federico Gonzaga and Ercole d&#x27;Este to gather a rival army and come to their rescue.

On 1 March 1479, Ludovico and his brother were declared rebels and enemies of the Duchy, and were denied the income they received by virtue of their mother&#x27;s dowry. After carrying out looting in Pisa, the two returned to La Spezia. In mid-May, peace negotiations began between the two sides.

On 29 July, Sforza Maria died near Varese Ligure, allegedly poisoned on the order of Cicco Simonetta. Ferrante appointed Ludovica as the Duke of Bari, succeeding his brother. Following Roberto Sanseverino, on 20 August Ludovico resumed the march to Milan at the head of an army of 8,000 men, crossing the Passo di Centocroci and going up the Sturla Valley. On 23 August he took the citadel of Tortona after having convinced the Castellan Rafagnino Donati to join his cause. He then marched through to Sale, Castelnuovo Scrivia, Bassignana and Valenza.

After these successes, Simonetta sent Ercole d&#x27;Este, Duke of Ferrara, to stop the rebels. Many nobles close to the duchess pushed for reconciliation. Bona finally allowed herself to be persuaded by her lover, Antonio Tassino, who was probably in league with Ludovico, to forgive her brother-in-law. On 7 September, Ludovico entered the castle of Milan. Simonetta was untrusting of Ludovico, and firmly opposed reconciliation. He reportedly said to the Duchess Bona &quot;I will lose my head and you, in time, will lose the state&quot;.

The Milanese Ghibelline nobility, which included Pietro Pusterla, took advantage of Ludovico&#x27;s presence in Milan to try to convince him to get rid of Simonetta, reminding him of all the sufferings that he and his brothers had suffered because of Simonetta. Ludovico, however, did not consider Simonetta a danger and judged it unnecessary to condemn to death a man now quite old and sick with gout. Pietro Pusterla planned an armed revolt against the Simonetta and sought the support of the Marquis of Mantua and Monferrato as well as Giovanni Bentivoglio and Alberto Visconti.

Ludovico, fearing a popular uprising, was forced to imprison Simonetta and his brother Giovanni, who were held in the prisons of the castle of Pavia.

===Death of Cicco Simonetta and exile of Duchess Bona===
Having secured the city, Ludovico recalled his brother Ascanio and Roberto Sanseverino to Milan. He sent envoys to forge or re-establish alliances with Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici, King Ferrante, and Pope Sixtus IV, and to prevent an alliance against him between the Swiss and the Republic of Venice.

Meanwhile, the Ghibelline nobility who had helped him in his rise to power, had lost Ludovico&#x27;s favor and aligned themselves with his brother Ascanio. Ludovico, persuaded by Sanseverino, ordered the arrest of his brother and his exile in Ferrara. Pietro Pusterla, Giovanni Borromeo, Antonio Marliani, and many others of the Ghibelline faction were also exiled.

On 30 October, Cicco Simonetta was beheaded at Visconti Castle in Pavia, overlooking Visconteo Park. The death of Simonetta benefited Antonio Tassino, Simonetta&#x27;s rival at court, who became increasingly arrogant. The Corio tells that when Ludovico and other Milanese nobles went to visit Tassino he would make them wait a long time outside the door until he had finished combing his hair. Tassino managed to convince Duchess Bona to replace Filippo Eustachi, prefect of the castle of Porta Giovia, with his father Gabriello. The prefect did not comply with the request and kept the oath made to the late Duke Galeazzo Maria to keep the castle until the age of majority of Gian Galeazzo.

Ludovico decided to secretly bring his nephews Gian Galeazzo and Ermes into the castle, under the pretext of protecting them from the ambition of Tassino. He convened his council, and Bona was forced to sign the sentence of exile for Tassino and his family. Due to the forced separation from her lover, Bona gave signs of so-called hysteria. She tried to leave the duchy and threatened suicide if she was prevented, which persuaded Ludovico and Roberto Sanseverino to let her leave for France. On 3 November 1480, Bona ceded the regency to Ludovico, who was appointed tutor of the young duke Gian Galeazzo, At the insistence of his son, Ludovico decided to no longer reside in Abbiategrasso.In 1481, perhaps orchestrated by Bona, there was an attempted poisoning against Ludovico and Roberto Sanseverino perpetrated by Cristoforo Moschioni, along with co-conspirators, the secretary of the Duchess Luigi Becchetti and the doctor Ambrogio Grifi. Moschioni was found innocent. The same year there was a second conspiracy planned by the Duchess against Ludovico, but once again it failed. The intercession of the Kingdom of France and the Duchy of Savoy prevented Bona from facing trial.

===To the regency of the duchy (1480–1494)===

====Engagement to Beatrice d&#x27;Este====
Ludovico initially planned to become Duke of Milan by marrying his sister-in-law Bona. Bona, however, was in love with Tassino, and so sought an alternative marriage for Ludovico. In 1480, she attempted to arrange a marriage with Ercole d&#x27;Este&#x27;s eldest daughter Isabella. Unbeknownst to Bona, a few days earlier Isabella had been promised to Francesco Gonzaga, Marquis of Mantua. The second daughter Beatrice, at the time only five years old, was instead selected for Ludovico. Ludovico was persuaded by Bona and was supportive of the marriage. The engagement promised to be more convenient, as Beatrice lived at that time at the Aragonese court of Naples. Beatrice had been raised by King Ferrante, her grandfather, who was very fond of her. Ludovico saw this as an opportunity for an alliance with the king of Naples as well as with the Duke of Ferrara. King Ferrante accepted the engagement and the two were betrothed. Beatrice remained in Ferrara until 1485, when Ludovica persuaded her family to allow her to return to Milan to be educated in a court more suited to her role.

====War of Ferrara====

In 1482, the Republic of Venice along with the Papal States entered into war against the Duchy of Ferrara. Ludovico and the Duchy of Milan entered the war in favour of his future father-in-law, Ercole d&#x27;Este. To support the war, Ludovico sent forces commanded by Federico da Montefeltro, then, after the death of da Montefeltro, his half-brother Sforza Secondo. The Venetian army was commanded by Roberto Sanseverino d&#x27;Aragona. On 6 January 1483, Pope Sixtus IV abandoned the alliance with the Venetians and allied with Ferrara. The Venetians, with the help of Costanzo Sforza, devised a plan to make Ludovico abandon his alliance with Ferrara. On 15 July, the Venetian army crossed the Adda. Ludovico met with Alfonso of Aragon and other representatives of the alliance in Cremona and decided to immediately counterattack the Venetians. On 22 July, King Alfonso gathered the army in Monza. The following day the Venetian army led by Roberto Sanseverino, realizing that their plan had failed, retreated to Bergamo.

In the summer of 1483, Gian Francesco and Galeazzo Sanseverino, Roberto&#x27;s sons, defected from the Venetian camp to pass respectively to the service of Alfonso of Aragon and Ludovico. Ludovico and Galeazzo would become close friends, and they remained as such throughout their lives. On 10 August, Ludovico and his brother Ascanio marched to Bergamo, forcing the surrender of many castles and threatening Bergamo itself. They managed to capture Romano after a three-day siege after which Ludovico returned to Milan.

Despite repeated success, Ferrara and its allies were unable to deal a decisive defeat to the Venetians. On 24 April 1484, the allies of Ferrara held a war council, meeting in the castle of Porta Giovia. There they decided to continue the war against the Republic of Venice, however, disagreements soon arose between Ludovico and Alfonso of Aragon. The Venetians, knowing that Ludovico had incurred massive debts in support of his father-in-law, offered him peace in exchange for money, provided that they retained control of the Polesine. Ludovico accepted and signed the agreement on 7 August in Bagnolo, against Ercole d&#x27;Este&#x27;s wishes.

===Marriage and private life===
After the war, Ludovico&#x27;s fiancée Beatrice had reached an age suitable for the wedding and her father was eager for a date to be set. Ludovico, however, as the Este ambassador recorded, had met a woman named Cecilia Gallerani. She was described as being very beautiful and was often at Ludovico&#x27;s side. Ludovico postponed his marriage to Beatrice three times, frustrating his future in-laws, who believed that he no longer intended to marry their daughter. Those close to Ludovico had been pressuring him for years to replace his nephew as the Duke of Milan, and wished for Beatrice to have a legitimate heir for him as soon as possible. In 1490, after thirteen months away, Ludovico&#x27;s brother Gian Galeazzo consummated the marriage with his wife Isabella of Aragon, who within a few days found herself pregnant. This event caused on the one hand the irritation Ludovico&#x27;s allies, and on the other convinced him of the need to marry Beatrice.

The wedding was set for the following January, and on 29 December 1490, the wedding procession left Ferrara to bring Beatrice to Milan. She was accompanied by her mother and other relatives. Beatrice&#x27;s brother Alfonso and cousin Ercole were to be married to two princesses of the Sforza house on the same occasion: the first Anna Maria, daughter of the late Galeazzo Maria and niece of Ludovico, the second Angela, daughter of Carlo Sforza and Bianca Simonetta (daughter of Cicco Simonetta).
On 18 January 1491, in a simple ceremony, Ludovico married Beatrice in the Ducal Chapel of the castle of Pavia. He had wanted the wedding to be celebrated in Pavia and not in Milan so as not to give the impression of attempting to challenge Gian Galeazzo, who had married Isabella of Aragon in the Duomo a few months earlier.

The marriage was declared to have been immediately consummated and the next morning Ludovico left for Milan to finish the preparations for the wedding party. In truth, the marriage remained secretly unconsummated for over a month, as the spouses had only met in person the day prior to the wedding. Additionally Ludovico, who at the time was thirty-eight years old, respected the youth and innocence of his bride, then fifteen, and did not want to force her to consume in a hurry. This aroused new concerns from his father-in-law Ercole, who urged for the marriage to be consummated immediately.

====Marital bond====
After the marriage, Ludovico became enamoured with his new wife. &quot;S.r Ludovico hardly ever takes his eyes off the Duchess of Bari&quot; wrote Tebaldo Tebaldi in August 1492, and already a short time after the wedding Galeazzo Visconti declared &quot;There is such a great love between them that I don&#x27;t think two people can love each other more&quot;. Ludovico was often seen kissing and caressing his wife, and he would stand beside bed for most of the day when she was sick. In a letter he wrote of her: &quot;she is dearer to me than the light of the sun&quot;. It is uncertain whether Beatrice reciprocated this affection, but some historians believe she did. Ludovico&#x27;s contemporaries noted, not without amazement, that Beatrice followed him everywhere, even in the course of her pregnancies. Her commitment to following Ludovico sometimes endangered her life, contrary to the custom of the time where women often remained to govern the house during their husbands absences. They were, in the short years they lived together, the model of an ideal couple.

The 15-year-old princess quickly charmed the Milanese court with her joyfulness and laughter. She loved extravagance, and helped make a reputation for Sforza Castle as a place of sumptuous festivals and balls. She enjoyed entertaining philosophers, poets, diplomats, and soldiers. Beatrice had good taste, and it is said that under her prompting her husband&#x27;s patronage of artists became more selective. During this time artists such as Leonardo da Vinci and Donato Bramante were employed at the court. She would go on to give birth to Maximilian Sforza and Francesco II Sforza, future Dukes of Milan.

Correspondences between Ludovico and those close to him demonstrate the affection he held for Beatrice. In a letter written to his mother-in-law a few months after the birth of his first son, Ludovico told her how he approved of the baby and how &quot;my wife and I, naked, carry him sometimes and we keep him between the two of us&quot;. Ludovico is noted for his concern to ensure his wife was satisfied at every whim. His correspondences also show a worry that she would discover times where he lied to her, for fear that she would no longer love him. He also attempted to shield her from tragedy, such as when Beatrice&#x27;s mother passed in 1493. In a letter to his father-in-law, he apologized for the delaying the mourning ceremonies in Milan, as he was waiting for a better moment to tell Beatrice about her mother&#x27;s death.

===Ascension as Duke of Milan and the Italian Wars===

Gian Galeazzo and his wife Isabella, after their lavish marriage, left Milan to set up court in Pavia. Gian Galeazzo did not have the desire to rule and he was happy to leave his uncle Ludovico in charge. His wife Isabella, however, turned out to be more ambitious and came into conflict with her cousin Beatrice. After Beatrice gave birth on 25 January 1493 to their first son, Ercole Massimiliano, she wished to have him, and not Isabella&#x27;s son, appointed as Count of Pavia . The title of Count of Pavia was typically reserved for the heir to the Duchy of Milan.

Isabella requested the intervention of her grandfather King Ferrante of Naples, so that her husband, now of age, would be given control of the duchy. Ferrante, however, had no desire to intercede, fearing the possibility of starting a war. He declared that he loved both granddaughters in the same way and asked them to settle matters while he was alive. When Ferrante died, his successor Alfonso sided with his daughter Isabella. In an act of aggression against Ludovico, he occupied the city of Bari.

To respond to the occupation, Ludovico allied himself with Emperor Maximilian and with the King of France Charles VIII. King Charles mobilized his armies south and conquered the kingdom of Naples, which Charles considered his legitimate possession, having allegedly been stolen from France by the Argonese. Emperor Maximilian promised to publicly recognize Ludovico&#x27;s succession to the duchy and to defend his interests, thus legitimizing the usurpation. To solidify the pact he married Bianca Maria Sforza, sister of the young Gian Galeazzo. This marriage brought him the sum of 400,000 ducats as a dowry, plus another 100,000 for the investiture, as well as many gifts.

On 11 September 1494, Charles VIII arrived in Asti and was received with great honors by Ludovico and Beatrice. With him also came his cousin Louis d&#x27;Orléans, who believed he was entitled to the title Duke of Milan, being a descendant of Valentina Visconti. Despite the latent hostilities, the first months of the visit passed without issue, and Ludovico used the charm of his wife Beatrice to placate the French and thus distract them. Eventually, Ludovico became jealous of a relationship forming between the Baron of Beauvau and his wife Beatrice, and he chose to send Beatrice back to Milan.

==Duke of Milan==
On 22 October 1494, Duke Gian Galeazzo died under mysterious circumstances. Officially, his was said to have died as a result of having not followed the treatment prescribed by his personal doctors for a long-term illness he suffered, and for the immoderate life he led. Unofficially, in the opinion of many prominent contemporaries such as Niccolò Machiavelli and Francesco Guicciardini, it was believed that the Duke was poisoned by his uncle Ludovico. Historian Malaguzzi Valeri disagrees with this opinion, pointing to how Ludovico was interested in the approval of his nephew, how he often sent him gifts such as dogs, horses and falcons, and how he was kept constantly informed of the care given to him. Valeri also notes that Gian Galeazzo had suffered stomach disorders since age 13 and that he continuously disobeyed the recommendations of doctors, continuing to drink large quantities of wine, going on fatiguing hunting trips, an engaging in a promiscuous sex life.

Ludovico immediately succeeded him with the support of the Milanese nobles, supplanting the legitimate heirs, thus reaching the apex of political power in the region.

It was during this time that Charles VIII conquered Naples, however, neither Ludovico nor his wife were particularly pleased with this victory. They had hoped Charles&#x27; campaign would frighten King Alfonso II and keep him engaged on another front, so as to distract him from Milan. Ludovico had counted on the fact that the lords of Italy, and especially Florence, would not let Charles pass. This defense was undermined by Piero de&#x27; Medici, who until then had been the strongest ally of the king of Naples. Frightened, Piero ended up throwing himself at the feet of the king of France, granting him not only free passage to Tuscany but even Pisa and Livorno, plus the sum of 120,000 florins. At this point Ludovico began to worry about the excessive interference of the French in the region, and the blatant threats of the Duke of Orléans. He decided to abandon his alliance with France, siding instead with the Holy League.

===The siege of Novara===
To respond to the threats of the Duke of Orléans in regard to his aspirations for the Duchy of Milan, Ludovico planned to attack the Duke&#x27;s stronghold of Asti. Unfortunately for Ludovico, the Duke of Orléans anticipated this move and countered it by occupying the cities of Novara and Vigevano.

Ludovico, worried for his family&#x27;s safety, retreated with his wife and children into the Rocca del Castello in Milan. Still feeling unsafe, Ludovico made plans with the Spanish ambassador to leave the duchy to take refuge in Spain. As Bernardino Corio writes, this was strongly opposed by his wife Beatrice and some members of the council, who convinced him to remain in Milan. The situation, however, remained unstable. Due to the expenses incurred for the investiture and dowry of Bianca Maria, the state was on the verge of financial collapse. There was no money to maintain the army and there was fear of a popular uprising. Some nobles and citizens were openly supportive of the Duke of Orléans.

At this time, Ludovico suffered what some historians speculate was a stroke. His hand had become paralyzed, and he never left the bedroom and was rarely seen. &quot;The Duke of Milan has lost his feelings,&quot; Malipiero writes, &quot;he abandons himself&quot;. To make matters worse, his father-in-law Ercole d&#x27;Este, together with the Florentines, was said to have secretly aligned themselves with the Duke of Orleans.

Disaster was averted by his wife Beatrice who, while temporarily appointed governor of Milan, ensured the loyalty of the nobles, then met with military captains in person at Vigevano to supervise their move against the Duke of Orleans. Some historians believe that if the Duke had attempted an assault on Milan at that time he would have taken it since the defences were severely weakened. Beatrice&#x27;s demonstration of strength was perhaps able to make him believe the defences were stronger than they were, and so the Duke of Orleans did not make an attempt and instead retreated to Novara. This hesitation was fatal to his campaign, as it allowed the Milanese time to reorganize their troops and surround him, forcing him into a long siege.

On 6 July 1495, the Battle of Fornovo took place. The Holy League&#x27;s forces took heavy casualties but were unable to stop Charles&#x27; march to Asti. In response, Ludovico redirected 70 tons of bronze to be used to make cannons. The bronze was originally intended to be used for an equestrian statue designed by Leonardo da Vinci.

In early August, Ludovico, finally healed, returned to deal with the war, and together with his wife went to reside at the Novara camp. 

On 24 September, a fight broke out in the camp between some German and Italian soldiers. While the exact cause of the fight is unknown, the Germans were said to have wanted to make &quot;cruel revenge&quot; against the Italians. Ludovico, fearing for his wife&#x27;s safety, begged Francesco Gonzaga to keep Beatrice safe. Gonzaga, &quot;with an intrepid spirit&quot;, rode among the Germans and with great effort managed to mediate peace. Upon learning of Gonzaga&#x27;s success &quot;Ludovico became the happiest man in the world, seeming to him that he had recovered the State and his life, and together with wife&#x27;s honor, for whose safety he feared more than for everything else&quot;.

In the meantime, the surrender of the Duke or Orleans was greatly anticipated. The Novara garrison was decimated by famine and epidemics, and Louis d&#x27;Orleans himself had fallen ill. In order to keep his men from surrendering, the Duke or Orleans falsely told them that the king would soon come to their rescue. This, of course, did not happen and he finally had to surrender, accepting an offer of safe conduct to the camp of King Charles. Of the few surviving soldiers, many died soon after from eating too much fruit after prolonged fasting. 

===Death of Beatrice===

In 1496, while Beatrice was expecting her third child, Ludovico met Lucrezia Crivelli, lady-in-waiting to his wife, who became his mistress. Beatrice, who previously had shown little jealously with her husbands infidelities, realized that Ludovico had this time fallen in love with Lucrezia. Beatrice opposed the relationship, however this did little to change Ludovico&#x27;s actions. Lucrezia became pregnant with Ludovico&#x27;s child only a few months after Beatrice had also become pregnant. She began to pull away from Ludovico, straining their marriage. Her sorrow deepened with the death of her closest friend Bianca Giovanna Sforza. Humiliated, embittered, and saddened, Beatrice died in childbirth the night of 2 January 1497.

====Ludovico in mourning ====
Ludovico, feeling he had betrayed his wife, went mad with grief and never recovered from her death. He had been convinced that he would die before her, and had expected her to rule Milan until their children came of age.&quot;And true, the death of Beatrice, the superb and intelligent Ferrarese, was a serious disaster for Ludovico il Moro. She was the soul of all his undertakings, she was the true queen of his heart and his court [...]. If the Duke of Bari [...] managed to represent on the theater of Europe a scene of much superior, as was observed, to his condition, it is largely due to this woman, vain feminally, if you will, and cruel, especially with the Duchess Isabella, but of resolute and tenacious character, of ready ingenuity, of soul open to all the seductions of luxury and to all the attractions of art. When it [...] failed [...] it was like a great storm that came to upset the soul of Ludovico. Nor did he ever recover from it; that death was the beginning of his misfortunes. Gloomy premonitions crossed his mind; it seemed to him that he had remained alone in a great stormy sea and inclined, fearfully, to asceticism. [...] the ghost of his beautiful and poor dead man was always before his spirit.&quot;

(Rodolfo Renier, Gaspare Visconti)For two weeks Ludovico locked himself in his apartments, allowed his beard to grow, and wore from then on only black clothes with a cloak torn up by a beggar. His only concern became the embellishment of the family mausoleum. The neglected Duchy fell into disrepair, and the Duke of Orléans, driven by fierce hatred of Ludovico, threatened a second campaign against Milan.

On the night of Beatrice&#x27;s death, Ludovico announced her passing to Marquis of Mantua Francesco Gonzaga, husband of his sister-in-law Isabella, saying: He told the ambassador from Ferrara to relay a message to his father-in-law, Duke Ercole, asking for his forgiveness.

Marino Sanuto the Younger wrote in his diary of Ludovico after Beatrice&#x27;s passing, &quot;Whose death the duke could not bear for the great love that she brought him, and said that he no longer wanted to take care of either his children, or the state, or worldly things, and just wanted to live [...] and since then this duke began to feel great troubles, while before he had always lived happily&quot;.

There were reports that Ludovico, during the funeral, wanted to remarry the deceased Beatrice as if she were alive, confirming their wedding vows. He begged his brother-in-law Francis not to send anyone to console with him, &quot;not to renew the pain&quot;. He refused, with a few exceptions, to receive condolences from anyone. He imposed a rule on the ambassadors that no one was to speak of Beatrice anymore, nor to grieve or show sadness, and to only speak of matters of state.

Somewhat contradictorily, Ludovico took every opportunity to commemorate his wife himself, of whom he created almost a cult. In addition to having a coin minted with the effigy of her on the reverse, something that had never previously been done, he started to more often use Beatrice&#x27;s coat of arms officially. He also had an effigy of her reproduced on a ring she wore on her finger, replacing a head of a Roman emperor. From Cristoforo Solari he commissioned a magnificent funeral monument with their two lying figures carved in marble, declaring that &quot;he would one day rest next to his wife until the end of the world&quot;.

For a whole year, he vowed to eat standing on a tray supported by a servant, and imposed fasting at court every Tuesday, the day of his wife&#x27;s death. In the castle he had a room decorated in all black, which became known as &quot;Saletta Negra&quot;, where he would go to mourn his wife in solitude. Whenever he traveled he had his quarters prepared in black. Every day he went at least twice to visit Beatrice&#x27;s tomb. Ambassadors who wanted to talk to him found him more often at the tomb than in the castle. He became convinced that God was punishing him for his sins and, while this did increase his religiosity, he also began to take an interest in necromancy.

Such visible manifestations of mourning were well noted by his contemporaries, however they were later interpreted by some historians as not being entirely genuine. This was due to the fact that although at first it seemed Ludovico had ended his relationship with Lucrezia Crivelli, in 1500 she found herself pregnant again. If this were the case, however, it is not clear what purpose the outward displays of grief served, nor why it continued for so long. Even in the most critical moments, such as on the day of his escape from Milan, his last act was to visit his wife&#x27;s tomb before leaving.

==Downfall and aftermath==

Charles VIII died childless in 1498, with the Duke of Orleans succeeding him as Louis XII of France. As King, he decided to take revenge for the humiliation he felt he suffered because of Ludovico, and began a second expedition against the Duchy of Milan. Lacking the valuable help of his wife Beatrice, Ludovico proved unable to deal with the threat.Louis XII entrusted the leadership of the army for the conquest of Milan to the famous leader Gian Giacomo Trivulzio, a personal enemy of Ludovico.

Ludovico chose to withdraw the troops he had stationed in Pisa, leaving control of the city to Venice. He subsequently reversed his alliance with Venice and helped Florence re-conquer Pisa in an effort to strengthen his alliance with them. Ludovico&#x27;s hope was that Florence would help him at least diplomatically against the arrival of King Louis XII. These actions did not have the intended outcome. Venice allied themselves with Louis XII against Ludovico, and his alliance with Florence was not made stronger. Because of this, Louis XII&#x27;s army was able to pass easily into Italy. 
Ludovico chose to flee, and on 1 September 1499, left Milan together with his sons and his brother Ascanio took refuge in Innsbruck with Emperor Maximilian I of Habsburg. Three of the Sanseverino brothers, Galeazzo, and came with him to Innsbruck, however instead switched sides and went to the service of the King of France. Immediately after the departure of the Ludovico, thanks in part to a revolt of the Milanese people oppressed by taxes, Trivulzio entered triumphantly in Milan. This event marked the start of a period of wars and foreign invasions in the Italian peninsula. Machiavelli directly blamed Ludovico and the policy he carried out, a judgment which many historians have agreed with over the centuries.

In Venice there were rumors that Ludovico, now in Germany, had gone mad. It was said that he had converted to Islam, had stabbed his son-in-law Galeazzo to death and wounded his brother Ascanio, and that he had been imprisoned. These rumors were, however, false. In Milan, the local population suffered under the occupation by the French. Upon hearing of this, Ludovico hired a Swiss mercenary army at the beginning of 1500. With the help of his brother Ascanio and the Sanseverino brothers, he was able to regain possession of Milan. Here, almost redeemed in the eyes of the Milanese, he declared to the people that he was now much delighted by the &quot;craft of arms&quot;, and that &quot;he liked the name of captain more than of lord&quot;.

The situation turned for the worse during the siege of Novara, when his Swiss mercenaries refused to participate in the battle. Novara had been recaptured by Ludovico and the Sanseverino brothers, but the French quickly returned and laid siege to the city. On 10 April 1500, the Swiss garrison was leaving Novara, passing a group of Swiss soldiers on the French side. French officers were posted to oversee their exit. As the disguised Ludovico passed the French, one mercenary, Hans Turmann of Uri, gave away his identity. He was apprehended by the French along with the Sanseverino brothers. A few days later, Ascanio, who had attempted to escape to Germany, was also captured.

Girolamo Priuli comments in this regard: &quot;Trivulzio, seeing these prisoners, and above all Signor Ludovico, thought oh, what joy!!&quot;.

The French were able to return and retake Milan, who lost its independence and remained under foreign domination for 360 years. Among the spoils of war taken by the French there was the great Visconti-Sforza Library which was located in the castle of Pavia. It consisted of over 900 manuscripts, including some that belonged to Francesco Petrarca. Of the codices of the library of the Dukes of Milan, 400 are still preserved today at the Bibliothèque nationale de France, while others ended up in Italian, European or American libraries.

The French rewarded the mercenary Turmann for his betrayal of the Milanese with 200 gold crowns, corresponding to roughly five years&#x27; salary. Turmann decided to desert the army, and escaped to France, but after three years he returned home to Uri. Turmann was then immediately arrested for treason, and on the following day he was executed by decapitation.

===Imprisonment and death===
Ludovico was taken prisoner to France, passing through Asti, Susa, and Lyon, where he arrived on 2 May. Emperor Maximilian petitioned Louis XII to free Ludovico, however the king refused to do so, instead choosing to humiliate the former duke, refusing to even meet with him. Ludovico was still considered a special prisoner, and was allowed to go fishing and receive friends. In 1501, news spread to Venice that Ludovico was becoming unstable, that &quot;his brain was wavering a lot&quot;. The king sent his personal physician to treat him, along with a court dwarf to cheer him up.

Ludovico was first detained at the castle of Pierre-Scize, then at Lys-Saint-Georges near Bourges. In 1504 he was moved to the castle of Loches where he was given more freedom. In 1508, Ludovico attempted to escape, but after his failure he was further deprived of amenities including his books. He spent the rest of his life in the castle&#x27;s dungeon, where he died on 27 May 1508.

The Swiss later restored the Duchy of Milan to Ludovico&#x27;s son, Maximilian Sforza. His other son, Francesco II, also held the duchy for a short period. Francesco II died in 1535, sparking the Italian War of 1536–1538, as a result of which Milan passed to the Spanish Empire.

The memory of Ludovico was clouded for centuries by Machiavelli&#x27;s accusation that he &#x27;invited&#x27; Charles VIII to invade Italy, paving the way for subsequent foreign domination. The charge was perpetuated by later historians who espoused the idea of national independence. More recent historians, however, placing the figure of Ludovico in its Renaissance context, have reevaluated his merits as a ruler and given a more equitable assessment of his achievement.

==Appearance and personality==

===Ludovico &quot;the tyrant&quot;===
While a good duke in times of peace, Ludovico faltered during times of war. Ludovico is described as a man with a mild, conciliatory character, who detested all forms of violence and cruelty. He made efforts to keep away from battlefields, and refrained from inflicting harsh punishments on the guilty.Many historians, therefore, believe he does not deserve the title of &quot;tyrant&quot; that is sometimes attributed to him, which if anything belongs to his brother Galeazzo Maria Sforza. As the duke before Ludovico, Galeazzo used to torment his subjects and even his friends with unspeakable torture and cruelty. Galeazzo was known to take the wives of others for his own pleasure, to such an extent that is widely considered the motivation for his alleged assassination in 1476.Ludovico perhaps took this example as a warning, and was rarely roused to anger. It was said that even in the last years of his life while imprisoned by King Louis XII, deprived of his state, his title, his wealth, and even his own children, Ludovico wrote papers on &quot;the things of Italy&quot; for Louis XII himself. In this, he explained to the King what was the best way to govern Lombardy, encouraged him to flatter the Florentines, not to antagonize the Pope, and never to trust the Venetians.

===Physical appearance===
Ludovico was quite tall for the time, between and in height, however he was by no means physically fit. He appreciated good food and above all he loved the mullets that his father-in-law Ercole sometimes sent him. Aliprando Caprioli says: &quot;he was not well disposed of body, but beautiful of face, and of generous presence&quot;.

Over the years Ludovico gained more and more weight until the death of his wife when he began to lose weight due to his continuous fasting. After being captured he became &quot;fatter than ever&quot;, as described by ambassador Domenico Trevisan, having become accustomed to imprisonment and being well-fed by King Louis XII.

Due to his size, he did not wear the tight-fitting farsetti typical of young men and condottieri, but rather baggy clothes that fell just above the knee. He had broad shoulders and highlighted them with solid gold chains, as can be seen in the so-called Sforza Altarpiece. From an early age, he had dark eyes, dark hair, and a dark complexion, and it was from these dark features where his nickname &quot;The Moor&quot; was derived. The Ferrarese chronicler Girolamo Ferrarini, who met him twenty-five years old in 1477, describes him as being &quot;of noble and beautiful appearance, although he is brown in the face&quot;. In 1492, the Venetian ambassadors called him a &quot;beautiful man&quot;. In his later years he suffered from several diseases, such as gout and asthma.

===Personality===
Ludovico was known to be prodigal with his friends, very liberal, condescending, and thoughtful. He was not an energetic man unless spurred to action. Later in life, perhaps as a result of a stroke, he became increasingly contradictory and unstable. Camillo Porzio said of Ludovico:Paolo Giovio, who instead has very harsh words for Beatrice, describes him as follows:

Ludovico was sometimes prideful, as in 1496 when he boasted that Pope Alexander was his chaplain, Emperor Maximilian his general, Venice his chamberlain, and the King of France his courier who had to come and go to Italy at his will. Guicciardini, who referred to Ludovico as the &quot;arbiter of Italy&quot;, also called him &quot;a very vigilant prince of very acute ingenuity&quot;.

 called him a man who &quot;does not love a person except out of fear or need&quot; and said &quot;he is mendacious, he is vindictive, very greedy, without shame, greedy for other people&#x27;s things ... in superlative pusillanimous, not to be trusted ... he is ambitious and never says good about anyone.&quot; He adds that he was the type of person who first says one thing then does another, who had no love for anyone and no one loved him, and who was convinced that he could underestimate the other powerful of Italy. For this, Trotti claimed that he had no true friends.

The chronicler Andrea Prato, who harshly reproaches him for having preferred Galeazzo Sanseverino to Gian Giacomo Trivulzio, paints a merciless picture, saying that he was indeed of rare and prudent intellect, but fearful to such an extent that he seemed to abhor not only battles but even to hear about atrocious and cruel things. Prato believed this was why he was not loved by soldiers, who want a spirited gentleman to stand by their side and expose himself to danger with them.

In his wife, he found a woman of strong character and a lover of war who was able to make up for her husband&#x27;s failings. Beatrice was his most faithful and valid collaborator, so much so that her death marked his downfall. Ludovico trusted Beatrice blindly, granted her great freedom, and entrusted her with important tasks, making her always a participant in the councils and negotiations of war. As a husband he was, therefore, well thought of, had not been for the continuous affairs. Some historians claimed that he beat his wife, but the confusion seems to arise from a letter from 1492, in which it is written that the Duke of Milan had &quot;beaten&quot; his wife. The Duke of Milan at that time was Gian Galeazzo, who was known to mistreat his wife Isabella. Ludovico was never known to make such a gesture towards that woman who he &quot;loved more than himself&quot;.

As a father, he was attentive, loving, and present. He showed great love above all towards his daughter, Bianca Giovanna, and found the pain of her untimely death unbearable.

====Love for the land====
One of Ludovico&#x27;s greatest passions, more than women, more than food, and more than the government, was agriculture. Ludovico liked to remember that his grandfather, Muzio Attendolo, was born a farmer before becoming a leader. Ludovico was an expert at growing vines and mulberries, as well as the famous &quot;moròn,&quot; which fed the silkworms that made the Milanese industry famous. He established his own farm near Vigevano, the so-called &quot;Sforzesca,&quot; with the adjacent field &quot;the Pecorara&quot; where various species of cattle, sheep and other animals were bred. Ludovico loved his farm and he often visited with his wife Beatrice, who like him was a lover of nature. It was no coincidence that he employed Leonardo da Vinci almost more as an engineer than as an artist, using his knowledge to build a series of aqueducts for irrigating the lands that were naturally arid. In the end he decided, by the official act of 28 January 1494, to donate the Sforzesca, along with many other lands, to his beloved Beatrice.

Ludovico also invested in horse and cattle breeding, as well as the metal industry. Some 20,000 workers were employed in the silk industry. He sponsored extensive work in civil and military engineering, such as canals and fortifications, continued work on the Cathedral of Milan and the Certosa of Pavia, and had the streets of Milan enlarged and adorned with gardens. The University of Pavia flourished under him. There were some protests at the heavy taxation necessary to support these ventures, and a few riots resulted.

====Astrology====
Perhaps because of his own insecurities, Ludovico was obsessed with astrology, so much so that the courtiers of Ferrara noticed that in Milan nothing was done unless Ambrose of Rosate, astrologer and personal doctor of Ludovico, had first consulted the stars.

====Culture====
Ludovico was a cultured man. He knew Latin and French and would often listen to the daily reading and commentary of the Divine Comedy that the humanist Antonio Grifo kept at the behest of the Duchess Beatrice. After her death and his capture, Ludovico asked to be able to keep a book of Dante&#x27;s work. He read this continuously during his captivity, even going as far as to translate it into French on the walls of his cell.

===Ludovico &quot;the seducer&quot;===
Ludovio was endowed with great charm and charisma, and became known as a seducer in his younger years. His contemporary, historian Francesco Guicciardini, claimed (probably falsely) that Ludovico had fallen in love with his niece Isabella of Aragon, which Guicciardini believed led him to make a deal with his nephew so that he did not consummate their marriage. Guicciardini boasted, in 1498, that it was out of jealousy of his wife that the Marquis Francesco Gonzaga played the &quot;double game&quot; between him and the Lordship of Venice, insinuating a relationship between Ludovico and his sister-in-law Isabella d&#x27;Este. These rumors spread to Venice and angered both the Marquis and his father-in-law Ercole, who were quick to deny them. While Isabella certainly always had a soft spot for Ludovico and envied her sister Beatrice for her fortunate marriage, wealth, and children, there is no proof that she was actually his mistress.

====Lovers====

Despite his great love for his wife, Ludovico had lovers both before and during their marriage, like many other gentlemen of the time. The first two of which there are records are Romana and Bernardina de&#x27; Corradis, probably both of low social status. In July 1485, Ludovico spoke in a letter &quot;of the pleasure that I already took a few days ago with a young Milanese, notable by blood, very honest and beautiful as much as I could have desired&quot;. Some historians identify this woman as Isabella Gallerani, while others believe it is probably his previously known lover Cecilia Gallerani, both sisters of Galeazzo Gallerani. Cecilia officially appeared at court in the summer of 1489, when the ambassador Giacomo Trotti attributed the cause of a certain mood of Ludovico to &quot;too much coitus with one of his girls whom he took with him, very beautiful, several days ago, who goes after him everywhere&quot;. Cecilia remained at court until early in 1491, when she was ousted by the new Duchess Beatrice. For some time after this, there were no more mention of lovers.

Between February and March 1495, coinciding with the birth of his second child, Ludovico had an affair with Isabella Trotti da Casate, a friend of Isabella d&#x27;Este. A letter addressed from da Casate to Ludovico at the time suggests that Ludovico did now want her to call herself his lover, perhaps out of respect for his wife Beatrice who read all his correspondences. Shortly afterwards he began his well-known relationship with Lucrezia Crivelli, herself already married, which caused a crisis in his marriage. It was rumoured at the time that Ludovico had not slept with Beatrice in months, instead investing his efforts in his affair with Lucrezia  Despite the strain on their marriage, Beatrice continued to love Ludovico, who in turn still showed outward affection for her. The relationship with Lucrezia officially lasted until the defeat of Ludovico, despite his phase of rigorous asceticism following the death of his wife. Upon his capture, Lucrezia sought refuge with the marquises of Mantua, along with the son they had had together and the enormous wealth she had accumulated.

It is speculated that Ludovico had another lover, Graziosa Maggi, however, the exact nature of their relationship is uncertain. Graziosa was a lady of Beatrice&#x27;s court, called &quot;Graziosa Pia&quot; because she was the wife of Ludovico Pio di Carpi, to whom Ludovico made a generous dowry. In August 1498, he addressed a letter to her in which he said, &quot;We will remind you of this alone: that you are loved by us only, thus deserving your virtues and customs.&quot; Another potential affair was had with Ippolita Fioramonte, another young lady in Beatrice&#x27;s court. This affair is only speculative, with the main evidence being that after the death of the duchess, Ludovico became very protective of Ippolita, bestowing on her a large dowry. During his life, some also suspected an affair between Ludovico and Chiara Gonzaga, sister of Marquis Francesco, however, Ludovico was quick to quell these rumours, and it is today believed they were merely friends.

Of the many rumours surrounding Ludovico&#x27;s affairs, one of the most notable involves Galeazzo Sanseverino. Ludovico was close friends with Sanseverino, continuously bestowing him with honours and privileges, to the point of marrying him to his daughter and appointing him regent together with his wife Beatrice. Galeazzo was a confidant for all of Ludovico&#x27;s secrets and acquired so much power in Milan that Ambassador Trotti wrote to the Duke of Ferrara: &quot;It seems to me that this Messer Galeazzo is Duke of Milan because he can do what he wants and has whatever he asks and desires.&quot;  He served his father-in-law faithfully and, although he was not as skilled in war as his brother , he was appointed as captain-general of the Sforza army from 1488 until Ludovico&#x27;s capture.

While some, such as Philippe de Comines, ascribed this behavior to nothing more than a close filial relationship, others believed their relationship to be more sexual in nature. Francesco Gonzaga openly accused Galeazzo of prostituting himself to Ludovico, and others believed that the two were engaged in sodomy.

The practice of sodomy, according to the ancient Greek custom, was widespread at that time, and many other lords were known to engage in it.

==Origin of the nickname &quot;Moro&quot;==
Ludovico earned the nickname &quot;Moro&quot;, the Moor, as a child. Crowds would often call him this he paraded through the cities of the Duchy. The Moors were Africans and Saracens, and so the most likely reason for this nickname was because of Ludovico&#x27;s bronze complexion, raven hair and black eyes, as visible from many of his portraits and as confirmed by the contemporary chronicler Gian Andrea Prato:
==Ludovico in art==
Ludovico and his court are frequent subjects in the art of the nineteenth century. During the romantic period, events such as the deep sorrow for the death of his wife Beatrice, the alleged poisoning of Duke Gian Galeazzo, and the presence of artists of the calibre of Leonardo da Vinci, inspired painters such as Giambattista Gigola (1816–1820), Giuseppe Diotti (1823), Francesco Gonin (1845), Francesco Podesti (1846), Cherubino Cornienti (1840 and 1858), Eleanor Fortescue-Brickdale (1920).

===Culinary===
The &quot;dolceriso del Moro&quot;, a typical dessert of the &quot;comune&quot; (municipality) of Vigevano, in Lombardy, is dedicated to Ludovico. Its invention is traditionally attributed to the Duchess Beatrice herself, who would have conceived it in the spring of 1491 to please her illustrious consort. It is a type of ricotta rice pudding, closed in a shortcrust pastry wrapper and enriched with candied fruit, pine nuts, almonds and rose water. This last ingredient served to induce harmony and fidelity in the couple.

===Legends===
* Ludovico is linked to one of the legends that arose around the invention of panettone, which would have been baked for the first time in his kitchens.
* Around the origin of the nickname &quot;Moro&quot; there is an ancient popular legend according to which Ludovico was as a child initially called &quot;the Bull&quot; because of his strength and impetuousness, while &quot;il Moro&quot; was the nickname of one of his plebeian playmate, Cesarino della Griona, who was incredibly similar to him if not for the fact of always being dirty. One day, which was Christmas 1462, the two decided as a joke to exchange roles: while Cesarino, washed and well dressed, pretended to be Ludovico in the hall of the court, the real Ludovico went down the chimney hood tied to a rope but got stuck. Cesarino himself rushed to his friend&#x27;s cries for help, freeing him by tugging him by the feet. At that point Duke Francesco Sforza, seeing his son all black for the soot, judged it necessary to exchange the nicknames of the two children, and so it was that Ludovico became &quot;the Moor&quot;, and Cesarino, for the strength demonstrated, &quot;the Bull&quot;. It is also said that this legend is the basis of the famous story &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot; by Mark Twain. 
* Among the various ghosts that would inhabit the castle of Vigevano, including that of his wife Beatrice, it is also said of a white horse that was seen running down the staircase leading to the Doge&#x27;s Square and here travel three laps of it before disappearing. The horse would have been the favourite of Ludovico, who would have wanted to avoid the dangers of war during the fateful defeat of Novara in 1500. In search of its master and finding the doors of the fortress barred, the animal would have beaten its hooves on the pavement of the square with such violence as to open a chasm into which it would finally fall.

==Lineage==

; Legitimate children

By his wife Beatrice d&#x27;Este, daughter of Ercole I d&#x27;Este, he had the following children:

* Ercole Massimiliano (1493–1530), count of Pavia, duke of Milan 1513 – 1515;
* Sforza Francesco (1495–1535), Prince of Rossano and Count of Borrello 1497 – 1498, Count of Pavia and Duke of Milan 1521 – 1524 married in 1533 to Christina of Denmark (1522–1590), daughter of King Christian II of Denmark.
* The third son, also a male, was born dead and, not having been baptized, could not be placed with his mother in the tomb. Ludovico, heartbroken, therefore had him buried above the door of the cloister of Santa Maria delle Grazie with this Latin epitaph: &quot;O unhappy childbirth! I lost my life before I was born, and more unhappy, by dying I took the life of my mother and the father deprived his wife. In so much adverse fate, this alone can be of comfort to me, that divine parents bore me, Ludovico and Beatrice dukes of Milan. 1497, January 2.&quot;

; Natural children

Ludovico had a series of natural children, all legitimized, which over the years greatly enlarged the ducal family and allowed Sforza himself to cement some alliances:

From his mistress Bernardina de Corradis he had:

* Bianca Giovanna (1482 – Milan, 23 November 1496), married Galeazzo Sanseverino, lord of Bobbio.

By his lover Cecilia Gallerani he had one son:

* Cesare (Milan, 1491 – 1514), abbot of the Basilica of San Nazaro in Brolo in Milan from 1498, canon from 1503.

By his lover Lucrezia Crivelli he had two children:

* Giovanni Paolo I Sforza or Giampaolo I Sforza (Milan, 14 March 1497 – Naples, 13 December 1535), from whom the Sforza branch of Caravaggio descends, married Violante Bentivoglio of the Counts of Campagna and lords of Bologna;
* A second child was born, probably, in 1500, since Lucrezia was once again pregnant when she found refuge with the Marquise Isabella d&#x27;Este.

From his lover Romana he had:

* Leone (1476 – Milan, 1496), between the end of 1495 and the beginning of 1496 married the young noblewoman Margherita Grassi, already widow of his uncle Giulio Sforza, to whom he had given a son. He died shortly after the wedding without having had offspring. He is often confused with his uncle of the same name, the latter abbot of San Vittore in Vigevano since 1495.

From dark lovers he had:

* Galeazzo, eldest son, born before 1476 and died a child, probably already before 1483, because in his first will, dating back to that year, Ludovico does not mention other children than Bianca and Leone.
* Sforza (1484/1485–1487).

Perhaps he also had another illegitimate son unknown to us if, as reported by Bernardino Corio, in 1496 three of his bastard sons died, namely Leo, Bianca, and a third who cannot be identified with any of the aforementioned.

<text>In necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas () is a Latin phrase.

==Origins and history==
It is often misattributed to Augustine of Hippo, but seems to have been first used in 1617 by Archbishop of Split (Spalato) Marco Antonio de Dominis in his anti-Papal &quot;De Republica Ecclesiastica&quot;, where it appears in context as follows (emphasis added):

Before the 21st century, academic consensus was that the source of the quotation was probably Lutheran theologian Peter Meiderlin (known as Rupertus Meldenius), who, in his &quot;Paraenesis votiva pro pace ecclesiae ad theologos Augustanae&quot; of 1626 had said, &quot;Verbo dicam: Si nos servaremus in necessariis Unitatem, in non-necessariis Libertatem, in utrisque Charitatem, optimo certe loco essent res nostrae&quot;, meaning &quot;In a word, let me say: if we might keep in necessary things Unity, in non-necessary things Freedom, and in both Charity, our affairs would certainly be in the best condition.&quot; Henk Nellen&#x27;s 1999 article that showed the phrase had previously been used by De Dominis overturned over a century of academic consensus.

According to Joseph Lecler, the substitution of &quot;dubiis&quot; for &quot;non necessariis&quot; (&quot;omnibus&quot; occurs here, rather than, as in Meiderlin, &quot;utrisque&quot;) was made in largely Catholic circles, and had the effect of extending &quot;the rule of Meldenius... to much more than just the &quot;necessaria&quot; [(for salvation)] and the &quot;non necessaria&quot; [(for salvation)]&quot;, much more than just the &quot;fundamental articles&quot;: &quot;the tripartite maxim... [thus] lost its original Protestant nuance, in order to extend liberty to the entire domain of questions debated, doubtful, and undefined [(non définies par l&#x27;Église)]&quot;.

==Theological usage==

The maxim has entered official Catholic teaching when Pope John XXIII&#x27;s encyclical &quot;Ad Petri Cathedram&quot; of 29 June 1959 used it favorably. In a section saying that sometimes religious controversies can actually help attain church unity, he says &quot;But the common saying, expressed in various ways and attributed to various authors, must be recalled with approval: in essentials, unity; in doubtful matters, liberty; in all things, charity.&quot;

In the United Methodist Church Book of Discipline, the phrase appears in the doctrinal history section as &quot;In essentials, unity; in non-essentials, liberty; and in all things, charity.&quot; A few lines later, the mandate is emphasized as &quot;the crucial matter in religion is steadfast love for God and neighbor, empowered by the redeeming and sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit.&quot;

<text>The Latin phrase odium theologicum (literally &#x27;theological hatred&#x27;) is the name originally given to the often intense anger and hatred generated by disputes over theology. It has also been adopted to describe non-theological disputes of a rancorous nature.

John Stuart Mill, discussing the fallibility of the moral consensus in his essay &quot;On Liberty&quot; (1859) refers scornfully to the &quot;odium theologicum&quot;, saying that, in a sincere bigot, it is one of the most unequivocal cases of moral feeling. In this essay, he takes issue with those who rely on moral feeling rather than reasoned argument to justify their beliefs.

== Academic disputes ==
The early linguist Leonard Bloomfield believed it necessary to develop linguistics as a cumulative, non-personal discipline; as a &quot;genuine&quot; science. In a talk in 1946, speaking of the development of the American Linguistics Society, he stated the fostering of such a discipline had saved it &quot;from the blight of the &quot;odium theologicum&quot; and the postulation of schools . . . denouncing all persons who disagree or who choose to talk about something else,&quot; and he added &quot;The struggle with recalcitrant facts, unyielding in their complexity, trains everyone who works actively in science to be humble, and accustoms him to impersonal acknowledgement of error.&quot;

Philosopher and historian of science Thomas Samuel Kuhn argued that scientists are strongly committed to their beliefs, theories and methods (the collection of which he termed &quot;paradigms&quot;), and that science progresses mainly by paradigm shifts. He claimed that scientists with conflicting paradigms will hold to them as dearly as theologians hold to their theological paradigms. Philosopher of math and science Imre Lakatos, a student of Karl Popper, described the nature of science in a similar manner. 

According to Lakatos, science progresses by continual modification or else supersession of what he termed &quot;research programs&quot; (roughly equivalent to Kuhn&#x27;s &quot;paradigms&quot;). Lakatos claimed that a research program is informed by metaphysical beliefs as well as observation of facts, and may infinitely resist falsification if a scientist wishes to continue holding it in spite of problems or the discovery of new evidence. If this view is correct, science does not remedy &quot;odium theologicum&quot;, it provides another field in which it may manifest. 

In the controversy over the validity of fluxions the philosopher George Berkeley addressed his Newtonian opponent:

Whatever view of science and the sociology of scientific knowledge is correct, it is a fact that in the history of science there have been many instances of new theories (e.g., germ theory of disease, finitude of the speed of light, radioactivity) being ridiculed and shunned by the greater scientific community when first proposed or discovered, only later to be adopted as more probably accurate.

<text>The Latin phrase  (meaning &quot;outside the Church [there is] no salvation&quot; or &quot;no salvation outside the Church&quot;) is a phrase referring to a Christian doctrine about who is to receive salvation. 

The expression comes from the writings of Saint Cyprian of Carthage, a Christian bishop of the 3rd century. The phrase is an axiom often used as shorthand for the doctrine that the Church is necessary for salvation. It is a dogma in the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church, in reference to their own communions. It is also held by many historic Protestant churches. However, Protestants, Catholics, and Eastern Orthodox each have a unique ecclesiological understanding of what constitutes &quot;the Church&quot;. For some, the church is defined as &quot;all those who will be saved&quot;, with no emphasis on the visible church. For others, the theological basis for this doctrine is founded on the beliefs that Jesus Christ personally established one (institutional) Church and that it serves as the means by which the graces won by Christ are communicated to believers.

==Scriptural foundation==
The doctrine is based largely on Mark 16:15–16:

== History ==

=== First appearance ===
The original phrase, (&quot;there is no salvation outside the Church&quot;), comes from Letter LXXII of Cyprian of Carthage (died 258). The letter was written in reference to a particular controversy as to whether it was necessary to baptize applicants who had been previously baptized by heretics. In , Cyprian tells Jubaianus of his conviction that baptism conferred by heretics is not valid. Firmilian (died ) agreed with Cyprian, reasoning that those who are outside the Church and do not have the Holy Spirit cannot admit others to the Church or give what they do not possess.

===Early Church Fathers===

The concept was also referred to by Origen in his &quot;Homilies on Joshua&quot;, but neither he nor Cyprian were addressing non-Christians, but those already baptized and in danger of leaving the faith, as that would involve apostasy. Earlier, Justin Martyr had indicated that the righteous Jews who lived before Christ would be saved. He later expressed a similar opinion concerning Gentiles. Those who act pleasing to God, while not &quot;being&quot; Christian are yet in some sense &quot;in&quot; Christ the &quot;Logos&quot;.Each one [...] shall be saved by his own righteousness, [...] those who regulated their lives by the law of Moses would in like manner be saved. [...] Since those who did that which is universally, naturally, and eternally good are pleasing to God, they shall be saved through this Christ in the resurrection equally with those righteous men who were before them, namely Noah, and Enoch, and Jacob, and whoever else there be, along with those who have known this Christ.

Gregory of Nazianzus took a rather broad view in his understanding of membership in the body of Christ. In the funeral oration for his father&#x27;s death in 374, Gregory stated: &quot;He was ours even before he was of our fold. His manner of life made him one of us. Just as there are many of our own who are not with us, whose lives alienate them from the common body, so too there are many of those outside who belong really to us, men whose devout conduct anticipates their faith. They lack only the name of that which in fact they possess. My father was one of these, an alien shoot but inclined to us in his manner of life&quot;. In other words, by their charity of life, they are united to Christians in Christ, even before they explicitly believe in Christ. Fulgentius of Ruspe took a much stricter view: &quot;Most firmly hold and never doubt that not only pagans, but also all Jews, all heretics, and all schismatics who finish this life outside of the Catholic Church, will go into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels&quot;.

Jerome wrote: &quot;This is the ark of Noah, and he who is not found in it shall perish when the flood prevails&quot;. Bede continues this theme: &quot;And according to this sense the ark is manifestly the Church, Noah the Lord who builds the Church&quot;.

Augustine of Hippo made numerous remarks in response to adversaries, often on opposite sides of this issue, once saying: &quot;Whoever is without the Church will not be reckoned among the sons, and whoever does not want to have the Church as mother will not have God as father&quot;. He could also pick up on the sayings of the Fathers, and be completely inclusive in his assessment: &quot;All together we are members of Christ and are his body [...] throughout the world [...] from Abel the just until the end of time [...] whoever among the just made his passage throughout this life, whether now [...] or in the generations to come, all the just are this one body of Christ, and individually his members&quot;.

===Other views===
Novatian (200–258), considered an antipope and a schismatic by the early church, says that the church is not for salvation, but that is a congregation of saints.

== Catholic Church ==
Writing while still a cardinal, Pope Benedict XVI (died 2022) commented that Cyprian was not expressing a theory on the eternal fate of all baptized and non-baptized persons.

The 1992 &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; explained this as &quot;all salvation comes from Christ the Head through the Church which is His Body&quot;.

* Pope Pelagius II (died 590): &quot;Consider the fact that whoever has not been in the peace and unity of the Church cannot have the Lord [...] Although given over to flames and fires, they burn, or, thrown to wild beasts, they lay down their lives, there will not be (for them) that crown of faith but the punishment of faithlessness. […] Such a one can be slain, he cannot be crowned. […] [If] slain outside the Church, he cannot attain the rewards of the Church&quot;.
*Pope Gregory I (died 604) in (&quot;An Extensive Consideration of Moral Questions&quot;) said: &quot;Now the holy Church universal proclaims that God cannot be truly worshiped saving within herself, asserting that all they that are without her shall never be saved&quot;. Pope Gregory XVI later quoted his predecessor in his 1832 encyclical (&quot;on mixed religious marriages&quot;).
*Pope Leo XII, ( #14, May 5, 1824): &quot;It is impossible for the most true God, who is Truth itself, the best, the wisest Provider, and the Rewarder of good men, to approve all sects who profess false teachings which are often inconsistent with one another and contradictory, and to confer eternal rewards on their members… by divine faith we hold one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and that no other name under heaven is given to men except the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth in which we must be saved. This is why we profess that there is no salvation outside the Church&quot;.
*Bishop John Carroll (died 1815), the first bishop in the United States, recognized a distinction between being in communion with the Church and being a member thereof:To be in the communion of the Catholic Church and to be a member of the Church are two different things. They are in the communion of profession of her faith and participation of her sacraments, through the ministry and government of her lawful pastors. The members of the Catholic Church are all those who with a sincere heart seek the true religion and are in unfeigned disposition to embrace the truth wherever they find it. It never was our doctrine that salvation can be obtained only by the former. Carroll traces this analysis back to Augustine of Hippo.
*Francis Cardinal Bourne, Archbishop of Westminster from 1903–1935, summarized the Church teaching as follows:If God the Creator speaks, the creature is bound to listen and to believe what He utters. Hence the axiom &quot;outside the Church there is no salvation&quot;. But, as it is equally true that without the deliberate act of the will there can be neither fault nor sin, so evidently this axiom applies only to those who are outside the Church knowingly, deliberately, and wilfully. […] And this is the doctrine of the Catholic Church on this often misunderstood and misrepresented aphorism. There are the covenanted and the uncovenanted dealings of God with His creatures, and no creature is outside His fatherly care. There are millions – even at this day the vast majority of mankind – who are still unreached or unaffected by the message of Christianity in any shape or form. There are large numbers who are persuaded that the old covenant still prevails and are perfectly sincere and conscientious in their observance of the Jewish Law. And there are millions who accept some fashion of Christian teaching who have never adverted to the idea of Unity as I have described it, and have no thought that they are obliged in conscience to accept the teaching and to submit to the authority of the Catholic Church. All such, whether separated wholly from acceptance of Christ and His teaching, or accepting that teaching only to the extent in which they have perceived it, will be judged on their own merits.

===Councils===
* Fourth Lateran Council (1215): &quot;There is but one universal Church of the faithful, outside which no one at all is saved&quot;.
* Council of Florence, &quot;Cantate Domino&quot; (1441): &quot;The most Holy Roman Church firmly believes, professes and preaches that none of those existing outside the Catholic Church, not only pagans, but also Jews and heretics and schismatics, can have a share in life eternal; but that they will go into the &#x27;eternal fire which was prepared for the devil and his angels&#x27; (Matthew 25:41), unless before death they are joined with Her; and that so important is the unity of this ecclesiastical body that only those remaining within this unity can profit by the sacraments of the Church unto salvation, and they alone can receive an eternal recompense for their fasts, their almsgivings, their other works of Christian piety and the duties of a Christian soldier. No one, let his almsgiving be as great as it may, no one, even if he pour out his blood for the Name of Christ, can be saved, unless he remain within the bosom and the unity of the Catholic Church&quot;. The same council also ruled that those who die in original sin, but without mortal sin, will also find punishment in hell, but unequally: &quot;But the souls of those who depart this life in actual mortal sin, or in original sin alone, go down straightaway to hell to be punished, but with unequal pains&quot;.

===Papal letters===
Pope Boniface VIII&#x27;s bull of 1302 was promulgated during an ongoing dispute between Boniface VIII and Philip IV of France. In it, Boniface declared, &quot;We are compelled in virtue of our faith to believe and maintain that there is only one holy Catholic Church, and that one is apostolic. This we firmly believe and profess without qualification. Outside this Church there is no salvation and no remission of sins&quot;. The bull notably extends what had been ecclesiastical &quot;dictum&quot; into relations with temporal powers. According to Robert W. Dyson, there are some who hold that Giles of Rome might have been the actual writer of the bull. It claims: &quot;We declare, say, define, and pronounce that it is absolutely necessary for the salvation of every human creature to be subject to the Roman Pontiff&quot;.

Pope Pius XI, in his 1928 encyclical , quotes from Lactantius: &quot;The Catholic Church alone is keeping the true worship. This is the font of truth, this is the house of faith, this is the temple of God; if any man enter not here, or if any man go forth from it, he is a stranger to the hope of life and salvation&quot;. The Pope then specifies: &quot;Furthermore, in this one Church of Christ, no man can be or remain who does not accept, recognize and obey the authority and supremacy of Peter and his legitimate successors&quot;.

===Second Vatican Council===

In calling the Second Vatican Council, Pope John XXIII noted a distinction between the truths of faith and how those truths are conveyed. In the 1973 declaration , the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith recognized that the articulation of revealed truth would necessarily be influenced by historical factors.

The Second Vatican Council declared that the Christian communities that are not in full communion, but only in &quot;partial communion&quot; with the Catholic Church, &quot;though we believe them to be deficient in some respects, have been by no means deprived of significance and importance in the mystery of salvation. For the Spirit of Christ has not refrained from using them as means of salvation which derive their efficacy from the very fullness of grace and truth entrusted to the Church&quot;. It explained that &quot;some and even very many of the significant elements and endowments which together go to build up and give life to the Church itself, can exist outside the visible boundaries of the Catholic Church: the written word of God; the life of grace; faith, hope and charity, with the other interior gifts of the Holy Spirit, and visible elements too. All of these, which come from Christ and lead back to Christ, belong by right to the one Church of Christ&quot;.

These elements, it said, &quot;as gifts belonging to the Church of Christ, are forces impelling toward Catholic unity&quot;. The Council identified Christ&#x27;s Church on earth with the Catholic Church, saying: &quot;This Church constituted and organized in the world as a society, subsists in the Catholic Church&quot;. The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith stated in a later doctrinal note that the term &quot;subsistit in&quot; and &quot;is&quot; are interchangeable, so that the &quot;one true Church&quot; is and subsists in the Catholic Church, according to Catholic teaching.

The Second Vatican Council also declared that &quot;it is through Christ&#x27;s Catholic Church alone, which is the universal help towards salvation, that the fullness of the means of salvation can be obtained. It was to the apostolic college alone, of which Peter is the head, that we believe that our Lord entrusted all the blessings of the New Covenant, in order to establish on earth the one body of Christ into which all those must be fully incorporated who belong in any way to the people of God&quot;.

=== &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; ===
The &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; states that the phrase, &quot;Outside the Church there is no salvation&quot;, means, if put in positive terms, that &quot;all salvation comes from Christ the Head through the Church which is his Body&quot;, and it &quot;is not aimed at those who, through no fault of their own, do not know Christ and his Church&quot;. At the same time, it adds: &quot;Although in ways known to himself God can lead those who, through no fault of their own, are ignorant of the Gospel to that faith without which it is impossible to please him, the Church still has the obligation and also the sacred right to evangelize all men&quot;. The &quot;Catechism&quot; also states that the Catholic Church &quot;is joined in many ways to the baptized who are honored by the name of Christian, but do not profess the Catholic faith in its entirety or have not preserved unity or communion under the successor of Peter&quot;, and that &quot;those who have not yet received the Gospel are related to the People of God in various ways&quot;.

The 2000 declaration of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith states that &quot;it must be firmly believed that the Church, a pilgrim now on earth, is necessary for salvation: the one Christ is the mediator and the way of salvation; he is present to us in his body which is the Church. He himself explicitly asserted the necessity of faith and baptism (cf. Mk 16:16; Jn 3:5), and thereby affirmed at the same time the necessity of the Church which men enter through baptism as through a door&quot;. It then adds that &quot;for those who are not formally and visibly members of the Church, salvation in Christ is accessible by virtue of a grace which, while having a mysterious relationship to the Church, does not make them formally part of the Church, but enlightens them in a way which is accommodated to their spiritual and material situation. This grace comes from Christ; it is [...] communicated by the Holy Spirit; it has a relationship with the Church, which, according to the plan of the Father, has her origin in the mission of the Son and the Holy Spirit&quot;.

===Inculpable ignorance===
In its statements regarding this doctrine, the Church expressly teaches that &quot;it is necessary to hold for certain that they who labor in ignorance of the true religion, if this ignorance is invincible, will not be held guilty of this in the eyes of God&quot;, and that &quot;outside of the Church, nobody can hope for life or salvation unless he is excused through ignorance beyond his control&quot;. It also states that &quot;they who labor in invincible ignorance of our most holy religion and who, zealously keeping the natural law and its precepts engraved in the hearts of all by God, and being ready to obey God, live an honest and upright life, can, by the operating power of divine light and grace, attain eternal life&quot;.

=== Strict interpretation ===

Some traditionalists called Feeneyites (such as the Slaves of the Immaculate Heart of Mary of New Hampshire and Most Holy Family Monastery) believe that only Catholics baptized with water can be saved. They reject the concept of baptism by desire and baptism of blood, and say that only a properly performed rite with the use of water and the requisite words is sufficient.

===Other or related views===

==Eastern Orthodox Church==
Kallistos Ware, a Greek Eastern Orthodox bishop, expressed this doctrine as follows:


== Lutheran interpretation ==

Martin Luther, the foremost leader of the Protestant Reformation, spoke of the necessity of belonging to the church (in the sense of what he saw as the true church) in order to be saved:

Therefore he who would find Christ must first find the Church. How should we know where Christ and his faith were, if we did not know where his believers are? And he who would know anything of Christ must not trust himself nor build a bridge to heaven by his own reason; but he must go to the Church, attend and ask her. Now the Church is not wood and stone, but the company of believing people; one must hold to them, and see how they believe, live and teach; they surely have Christ in their midst. For outside of the Christian church there is no truth, no Christ, no salvation.

Modern Lutheran churches &quot;do agree with the traditional statement that &#x27;outside the catholic church there is no salvation&#x27;, but this statement refers not to the Roman organization but to the Holy Christian Catholic and Apostolic Church, which consists of all who believe in Christ as their Savior&quot;.

== Reformed interpretation ==

The Genevan reformer John Calvin, in his Reformation-era work &quot;Institutes of the Christian Religion&quot;, wrote: &quot;beyond the pale of the Church no forgiveness of sins, no salvation, can be hoped for&quot;. Calvin wrote also that &quot;those to whom He is a Father, the Church must also be a mother,&quot; echoing the words of the originator of the Latin phrase himself, Cyprian: &quot;He can no longer have God for his Father who has not the Church for his mother&quot;.

Reformed scholastics accepted the phrase so long as the church is recognized by the marks of the church, which they defined as proper administration of the Word and sacrament, rather than apostolic succession.

The idea is further affirmed in the Westminster Confession of Faith of 1647 that &quot;the visible Church, which is also catholic or universal under the Gospel (not confined to one nation, as before under the law), consists of all those throughout the world that profess the true religion; and of their children; and is the Kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ, the house and family of God, out of which there is no ordinary possibility of salvation&quot;.

== Methodist interpretation ==

The Methodist tradition, inclusive of the holiness movement, holds that the office of the keys is exercised when the Church baptizes an individual and pronounces them saved. The office of the keys is furthermore exercised in the Church &quot;binding and loosing&quot;, being able to excommunicate individuals from the sacraments as &quot;ordinarily, no one is saved outside the visible church&quot;. The purpose of this is to allow individuals to repent and come into full communion with the Church so that they might receive &quot;final salvation&quot;.

<text>Samuel Schmid (born 8 January 1947) is a Swiss politician who served as a Member of the Swiss Federal Council from 2000 to 2008. He was the head of the Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sports (notably acting as a defense minister for Switzerland).

Schmid was born in Rüti bei Büren, Canton of Bern. He was elected to the Federal Council on 6 December 2000. He was a member of the Swiss People&#x27;s Party (SVP/UDC), and is now a member of The Centre. During his time in office he has held the Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sports. In 2004, he was the vice-President of the Confederation and President in 2005.

Schmid was a member of the SVP&#x27;s centrist/agrarian wing. He was put under pressure by the party&#x27;s nationalist wing, led by National Councillor Christoph Blocher, for taking a moderate stance on certain issues. After the SVP became the largest party in the Federal Assembly in the 2003 federal elections, the SVP threatened to remove Schmid from the Council if it didn&#x27;t get an additional seat (which eventually went to Blocher in that year).

After Blocher was defeated for reelection to the Federal Council in favour of another SVP moderate, Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf, the SVP caucus voted to exclude Schmid and Widmer-Schlumpf from the party group. Some called for them to be thrown out of the party altogether. However, Swiss parties are legally federations of cantonal parties. For Schmid to have been expelled, the SVP&#x27;s Bern section would have had to terminate his membership, and it refused to do so. In 2008, Schmid joined the newly formed Conservative Democratic Party, along with almost all of the SVP&#x27;s Bern section.

On 12 November 2008, Schmid resigned from the Federal Council effective 1 January 2009. The resignation followed a months-long period of intense political pressure by the Swiss People&#x27;s Party owing to scandals and accidents in the Swiss military, as well as bouts of ill health. Samuel Schmid was succeeded by Ueli Maurer of the Swiss People&#x27;s Party.

<doc id="239962" wikidata="Q5419148" url="?curid=239962" title="Ex Cathedra">
<text>Ex Cathedra ( ) is a leading British choir and early music ensemble based in Birmingham in the West Midlands, England. It performs choral music spanning the 15th to 21st centuries, and regularly commissions new works.

Ex Cathedra was founded in Birmingham in 1969 by Jeffrey Skidmore OBE, its artistic director and conductor. It comprises a chamber choir of about 40 singers, a specialist vocal Consort made up of ten professional singers who feature regularly as soloists, and a Baroque ensemble/orchestra. It is known for its passion for seeking out the best, the unfamiliar and the unexpected in the choral repertoire and for giving dynamic performances underpinned by detailed research.

Each year, the choir presents a season of diverse programmes in a variety of venues in and around Birmingham, across the Midlands and in London. It has been a resident ensemble at Birmingham Town Hall Symphony Hall since 2007. Since 2014 has made regular appearances at Hereford Cathedral, St Peter&#x27;s Collegiate Church in Wolverhampton, Southwell Minster and St James the Greater in Leicester.

Ex Cathedra has been invited to perform in concert series and festivals across the UK and as far afield as Israel and New York, including the BBC Proms where it performed Stockhausen in 2013, the Barbican Centre, Brighton Early Music Festival, Cheltenham Music Festival, Edinburgh International Festival, Kilkenny Festival, Lichfield Festival, London Festival of Baroque Music, Spitalfields Festival, St David&#x27;s Festival, Three Choirs Festival and York Early Music Festival. The group has also appeared at festivals in Belgium, Finland, France, (Germany), Israel, Italy and Spain. 

Ex Cathedra has collaborated with Fretwork (music group), the City Musick, His Majestys Sagbutts &amp; Cornetts, Concerto Palatino, Birmingham Opera Company, Sinfonia New York, Birmingham Royal Ballet, the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, Quebecois dance company Cas Public, the Shakespeare Institute, and the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust.

The first period instrument orchestra to be established in an English regional city, Ex Cathedra&#x27;s Baroque Orchestra was founded as part of the choir&#x27;s 1983–1984 season and made its début with a performance of Bach&#x27;s &quot;Mass in B Minor&quot;. Comprising the UK&#x27;s leading period instrumentalists, the orchestra&#x27;s principals regularly give master classes and coach students at the Birmingham Conservatoire as part of its early music programme.

==Music education==
Ex Cathedra has its own youth and children&#x27;s choirs, the Academy of Vocal Music, for children aged 4–20. In 2017 it launched a Scholarships scheme for young professionals and, in partnership with Birmingham Conservatoire, a Student Scholarships scheme.

In addition, since 1990 the choir has been involved in education programmes in schools and local communities. It established Ring of Sound, an intergenerational choir for the Perry Common Regeneration Project and runs Singing Communities Ladywood, a community choir in the Ladywood inner city district of Birmingham.

Ex Cathedra&#x27;s &#x27;Singing Medicine&#x27; project has worked with children every week across all wards since 2004 at Birmingham Children&#x27;s Hospital, at paediatric wards at Birmingham Heartland&#x27;s Hospital since 2011, and at Birmingham Women&#x27;s Hospital since 2016.

For over 25 years, Ex Cathedra has worked extensively in schools, particularly focusing on primary schools. This activity expanded during the 2007–2008 academic year, when Ex Cathedra inducted its &#x27;Singing Playgrounds&#x27; project in schools in Birmingham, Coventry, Derby and London as part of the government&#x27;s Sing Up initiative. By 2017, &#x27;Singing Playgrounds&#x27; had reached over 600 schools across the UK and as far afield as Belgium, China, New Zealand, Singapore and Thailand.

==Recordings==
Ex Cathedra has made a number of critically acclaimed recordings for ASV Records, NMC, Orchid, Signum Records, Somm Records, Hyperion Records, and on its own label. It is well known for its recordings of French and Latin American Baroque music. 

In 2015 the CD &#x27;Britten to America&#x27; was shortlisted for a Grammy Award, whilst &#x27;A French Baroque Diva&#x27; won a Gramophone Award 2015 (Recital category): &quot;It is no longer enough for recitals merely to bunch together a dozen or so favourite lollipops. The most stimulating essays in the genre are revealing a clear fashion for a proper conceptual theme that requires some scholarly research and creative programming, placing musical entertainment and philological exploration on an equal par. The shortlisted finalists for this year&#x27;s Recital Award typify this trend, and best of the distinguished crop is Jeffrey Skidmore and Carolyn Sampson&#x27;s exposition of the career of Marie Fel (1713–94)... Skidmore&#x27;s expert direction, Ex Cathedra&#x27;s stylish orchestra (and expert choir) and Sampson&#x27;s sincere singing ensure that this is both musically thrilling and a fascinating contextual journey.&quot;

===Hyperion lawsuit===
In 2001, Ex Cathedra recorded four works by Michel-Richard de Lalande for Hyperion Records. The sessions used editions prepared by scholar Lionel Sawkins. Sawkins went on to sue Hyperion for royalties arising from his claimed copyright in the editions. The recording was issued but subsequently withdrawn from the market after Sawkins won the lawsuit and subsequent appeal. 

Upon Hyperion&#x27;s appeal, the Court of Appeal held on 19 May 2005 that Sawkins owned the copyright in his modern performing editions of the de Lalande music, even though de Lalande&#x27;s music itself was out of copyright. The decision was not welcomed by all. Peter Phillips, the director of the Tallis Scholars and a music editor himself, said: &quot;All the music I perform has to be edited, or we couldn&#x27;t read it. But copyright should be there ... to reward creativity, not scholarship or diligence. How much an editor did or did not write should never be asked and judged upon during a million-pound lawsuit involving a small and innovative recording company.&quot;

<doc id="239964" wikidata="Q648619" url="?curid=239964" title="F Sharp (programming language)">
<text>F# (pronounced F sharp) is a general-purpose, high-level, strongly typed, multi-paradigm programming language that encompasses functional, imperative, and object-oriented programming methods. It is most often used as a cross-platform Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) language on .NET, but can also generate JavaScript and graphics processing unit (GPU) code.

F# is developed by the F# Software Foundation, Microsoft and open contributors. An open source, cross-platform compiler for F# is available from the F# Software Foundation. F# is a fully supported language in Visual Studio and JetBrains Rider. Plug-ins supporting F# exist for many widely used editors including Visual Studio Code, Vim, and Emacs.

F# is a member of the ML language family and originated as a .NET Framework implementation of a core of the programming language OCaml. It has also been influenced by C#, 
Python, Haskell, Scala and Erlang.

==History==

===Versions===
===Language evolution===
F# uses an open development and engineering process. 
The language evolution process is managed by Don Syme from Microsoft Research as the benevolent dictator for life (BDFL) for the language design, together with the F# Software Foundation.
Earlier versions of the F# language were designed by Microsoft and Microsoft Research using a closed development process.

F# was first included in Visual Studio in the 2010 edition, at the same level as Visual Basic (.NET) and C# (albeit as an option), and remains in all later editions, thus making the language widely available and well-supported.

F# originates from Microsoft Research, Cambridge, UK. The language was originally designed and implemented by Don Syme, according to whom in the fsharp team, they say the F is for &quot;Fun&quot;. 
Andrew Kennedy contributed to the design of units of measure. The Visual F# Tools for Visual Studio are developed by Microsoft. The F# Software Foundation developed the F# open-source compiler and tools, incorporating the open-source compiler implementation provided by the Microsoft Visual F# Tools team.

==Language overview==

===Functional programming===
F# is a strongly typed functional-first language with a large number of capabilities that are normally found only in functional programming languages, while supporting object-oriented features available in C#. Together, these features allow F# programs to be written in a completely functional style and also allow functional and object-oriented styles to be mixed.

Examples of functional features are:

* Everything is an expression
* Type inference (using Hindley–Milner type inference)
* Functions as first-class citizens
* Anonymous functions with capturing semantics (i.e., closures)
* Immutable variables and objects
* Lazy evaluation support
* Higher-order functions
* Nested functions
* Currying
* Pattern matching
* Algebraic data types 
* Tuples
* List comprehension
* Monad pattern support (called &quot;computation expressions&quot;)
* Tail call optimisation

F# is an expression-based language using eager evaluation and also in some instances lazy evaluation. Every statement in F#, 
including codice_1 expressions, codice_2 expressions and loops, is a composable expression with a static type. Functions and expressions that do not return any value have a return type of codice_3. F# uses the codice_4 keyword for binding values to a name. For example:

let x = 3 + 4

binds the value codice_5 to the name codice_6.

New types are defined using the codice_7 keyword. For functional programming, F# provides &quot;tuple&quot;, &quot;record&quot;, &quot;discriminated union&quot;, &quot;list&quot;, &quot;option&quot;, and &quot;result&quot; types. A &quot;tuple&quot; represents a set of &quot;n&quot; values, where &quot;n&quot; ≥ 0. The value &quot;n&quot; is called the arity of the tuple. A 3-tuple would be represented as codice_8, where A, B, and C are values of possibly different types. A tuple can be used to store values only when the number of values is known at design-time and stays constant during execution.

A &quot;record&quot; is a type where the data members are named. Here is an example of record definition: 

 type R = 
 { Name : string 
 Age : int }

Records can be created as }. The codice_9 keyword is used to create a copy of a record, as in }, which creates a new record by copying codice_10 and changing the value of the codice_11 field (assuming the record created in the last example was named codice_10).

A discriminated union type is a type-safe version of C unions. For example,

 type A = 
 | UnionCaseX of string
 | UnionCaseY of int

Values of the union type can correspond to either union case. The types of the values carried by each union case is included in the definition of each case.

The &quot;list&quot; type is an immutable linked list represented either using a notation (codice_13 is the cons operator) or a shorthand as . An empty list is written codice_14. The &quot;option&quot; type is a discriminated union type with choices codice_15 or codice_16. F# types may be generic, implemented as generic .NET types.

F# supports lambda functions and closures. All functions in F# are first class values and are immutable. Functions can be curried. Being first-class values, functions can be passed as arguments to other functions. Like other functional programming languages, F# allows function composition using the codice_17 and codice_18 operators.

F# provides &quot;&quot; that define a sequence codice_19, list codice_20 or array codice_21 through code that generates values. For example,

 seq { for b in 0 .. 25 do
 if b &lt; 15 then
 yield b*b }

forms a sequence of squares of numbers from 0 to 14 by filtering out numbers from the range of numbers from 0 to 25. Sequences are generators – values are generated on-demand (i.e., are lazily evaluated) – while lists and arrays are evaluated eagerly.

F# uses pattern matching to bind values to names. Pattern matching is also used when accessing discriminated unions – the union is value matched against pattern rules and a rule is selected when a match succeeds. F# also supports &quot;active patterns&quot; as a form of extensible pattern matching. It is used, for example, when multiple ways of matching on a type exist.

F# supports a general syntax for defining compositional computations called &quot;&quot;. Sequence expressions, asynchronous computations and queries are particular kinds of computation expressions. Computation expressions are an implementation of the monad pattern.

===Imperative programming===
F# support for imperative programming includes
* codice_22 loops
* codice_23 loops
* arrays, created with the codice_21 syntax
* hash table, created with the codice_25 syntax or codice_26 type.
Values and record fields can also be labelled as codice_27. For example:

// Define &#x27;x&#x27; with initial value &#x27;1&#x27;
let mutable x = 1
// Change the value of &#x27;x&#x27; to &#x27;3&#x27;
x &lt;- 3

Also, F# supports access to all CLI types and objects such as those defined in the codice_28 namespace defining imperative data structures.

===Object-oriented programming===
Like other Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) languages, F# can use CLI types through object-oriented programming. F# support for object-oriented programming in expressions includes:
* Dot-notation, e.g., 
* Object expressions, e.g., }
* Object construction, e.g., 
* Type tests, e.g., 
* Type coercions, e.g., 
* Named arguments, e.g., 
* Named setters, e.g., 
* Optional arguments, e.g., 

Support for object-oriented programming in patterns includes
* Type tests, e.g., 
* Active patterns, which can be defined over object types

F# object type definitions can be class, struct, interface, enum, or delegate type definitions, corresponding to the definition forms found in C#. For example, here is a class with a constructor taking a name and age, and declaring two properties.

/// A simple object type definition
type Person(name : string, age : int) =
 member x.Name = name
 member x.Age = age
===Asynchronous programming===
F# supports asynchronous programming through &quot;asynchronous workflows&quot;. An asynchronous workflow is defined as a sequence of commands inside an codice_29, as in

let asynctask = 
 async { let req = WebRequest.Create(url)
 let! response = req.GetResponseAsync()
 use stream = response.GetResponseStream()
 use streamreader = new System.IO.StreamReader(stream)
 return streamreader.ReadToEnd() }

The codice_30 indicates that the expression on the right (getting the response) should be done asynchronously but the flow should only continue when the result is available. In other words, from the point of view of the code block, it&#x27;s as if getting the response is a blocking call, whereas from the point of view of the system, the thread won&#x27;t be blocked and may be used to process other flows until the result needed for this one becomes available.

The async block may be invoked using the codice_31 function. Multiple async blocks can be executed in parallel using the codice_32 function that takes a list of codice_33 objects (in the example, codice_34 is an async object) and creates another async object to run the tasks in the lists in parallel. The resultant object is invoked using codice_31.

Inversion of control in F# follows this pattern.

Since version 6.0, F# supports creating, consuming and returning .NET tasks directly. 
 open System.Net.Http
 let fetchUrlAsync (url:string) = // string -&gt; Task&lt;string&gt;
 task {
 use client = new HttpClient()
 let! response = client.GetAsync(url) 
 let! content = response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync()
 do! Task.Delay 500
 return content

 // Usage
 let fetchPrint() =
 let task = task {
 let! data = fetchUrlAsync &quot;https://example.com&quot;
 printfn $&quot;{data}&quot;
 task.Wait()

===Parallel programming===
Parallel programming is supported partly through the codice_32, codice_37 and other operations that run asynchronous blocks in parallel.

Parallel programming is also supported through the codice_38 functional programming operators in the F# standard library, direct use of the codice_39 task programming model, the direct use of .NET thread pool and .NET threads and through dynamic translation of F# code to alternative parallel execution engines such as GPU code.

===Units of measure===
The F# type system supports units of measure checking for numbers. 

In F#, you can assign units of measure, such as meters or kilograms, to floating point, unsigned integer and signed integer values. This allows the compiler to check that arithmetic involving these values is dimensionally consistent, helping to prevent common programming mistakes by ensuring that, for instance, lengths aren&#x27;t mistakenly added to times.

The units of measure feature integrates with F# type inference to require minimal type annotations in user code.

[&lt;Measure&gt;] type m // meter
[&lt;Measure&gt;] type s // second

let distance = 100.0&lt;m&gt; // float&lt;m&gt;
let time = 5.0&lt;s&gt; // float&lt;s&gt;
let speed = distance/time // float&lt;m/s&gt;
[&lt;Measure&gt;] type kg // kilogram
[&lt;Measure&gt;] type N = (kg * m)/(s^2) // Newtons
[&lt;Measure&gt;] type Pa = N/(m^2) // Pascals 

[&lt;Measure&gt;] type days 
let better_age = 3u&lt;days&gt; // uint&lt;days&gt;

The F# static type checker provides this functionality at compile time, but units are erased from the compiled code. Consequently, it is not possible to determine a value&#x27;s unit at runtime.

===Metaprogramming===
F# allows some forms of syntax customizing via metaprogramming to support embedding custom domain-specific languages within the F# language, particularly through computation expressions.

F# includes a feature for run-time meta-programming called quotations. A quotation expression evaluates to an abstract syntax tree representation of the F# expressions. Similarly, definitions labelled with the codice_40 attribute can also be accessed in their quotation form. F# quotations are used for various purposes including to compile F# code into JavaScript and GPU code. Quotations represent their F# code expressions as data for use by other parts of the program while requiring it to be syntactically correct F# code.

===Information-rich programming===
F# 3.0 introduced a form of compile-time meta-programming through statically extensible type generation called F# type providers. F# type providers allow the F# compiler and tools to be extended with components that provide type information to the compiler on-demand at compile time. F# type providers have been used to give strongly typed access to connected information sources in a scalable way, including to the Freebase knowledge graph.

In F# 3.0 the F# quotation and computation expression features are combined to implement LINQ queries. For example:

// Use the OData type provider to create types that can be used to access the Northwind database.
open Microsoft.FSharp.Data.TypeProviders

type Northwind = ODataService&lt;&quot;http://services.odata.org/Northwind/Northwind.svc&quot;&gt;
let db = Northwind.GetDataContext()

// A query expression.
let query1 = query { for customer in db.Customers do
 select customer }
The combination of type providers, queries and strongly typed functional programming is known as &quot;information rich programming&quot;.

===Agent programming===
F# supports a variation of the actor programming model through the in-memory implementation of lightweight asynchronous agents. For example, the following code defines an agent and posts 2 messages:
 type Message =
 | Enqueue of string
 | Dequeue of AsyncReplyChannel&lt;Option&lt;string»

 // Provides concurrent access to a list of strings
 let listManager = MailboxProcessor.Start(fun inbox -&gt;
 let rec messageLoop list = async {
 let! msg = inbox.Receive()
 match msg with
 | Enqueue item -&gt;
 return! messageLoop (item :: list)

 | Dequeue replyChannel -&gt;
 match list with
 replyChannel.Reply None
 return! messageLoop list
 | head :: tail -&gt;
 replyChannel.Reply (Some head)
 return! messageLoop tail

 // Start the loop with an empty list
 messageLoop []

 // Usage 
 async {
 // Enqueue some strings
 listManager.Post(Enqueue &quot;Hello&quot;)
 listManager.Post(Enqueue &quot;World&quot;)

 // Dequeue and process the strings
 let! str = listManager.PostAndAsyncReply(Dequeue)
 str |&gt; Option.iter (printfn &quot;Dequeued: %s&quot;)
 |&gt; Async.Start


==Development tools==
* Visual Studio, with the Visual F# tools from Microsoft installed, can be used to create, run and debug F# projects. The Visual F# tools include a Visual Studio-hosted read–eval–print loop (REPL) interactive console that can execute F# code as it is written. Visual Studio for Mac also fully supports F# projects.
* Visual Studio Code contains full support for F# via the Ionide extension.
* F# can be developed with any text editor. Specific support exists in editors such as Emacs.
* JetBrains Rider is optimized for the development of F# Code starting with release 2019.1.
* LINQPad has supported F# since version 2.x.
===Comparison of integrated development environments===
==Application areas==
F# is a general-purpose programming language.

===Web programming===

The SAFE Stack is an end-to-end F# stack to develop web applications. It uses ASP.NET Core on the server side and Fable on the client side.

An alternative end-to-end F# option is the WebSharper framework.

===Cross-platform app development===

F# can be used together with the Visual Studio Tools for Xamarin to develop apps for iOS and Android. The Fabulous library provides a more comfortable functional interface.

=== Analytical programming ===
Among others, F# is used for quantitative finance programming, energy trading and portfolio optimization, machine learning, business intelligence and social gaming on Facebook.

In the 2010s, F# has been positioned as an optimized alternative to C#. F#&#x27;s scripting ability and inter-language compatibility with all Microsoft products have made it popular among developers.

===Scripting===
F# can be used as a scripting language, mainly for desktop read–eval–print loop (REPL) scripting.

==Open-source community==
The F# open-source community includes the F# Software Foundation and the F# Open Source Group at GitHub. Popular open-source F# projects include:

* Fable, an F# to Javascript transpiler based on Babel.
* Paket, an alternative package manager for .NET that can still use NuGet repositories, but has centralised version-management.
* FAKE, an F# friendly build-system.
* Giraffe, a functionally oriented middleware for ASP.NET Core.
* Suave, a lightweight web-server and web-development library.

==Compatibility==
F# features a legacy &quot;ML compatibility mode&quot; that can directly compile programs written in a large subset of OCaml roughly, with no functors, objects, polymorphic variants, or other additions.

==Examples==
A few small samples follow:

// This is a comment for a sample hello world program.
printfn &quot;Hello World!&quot;

A record type definition. Records are immutable by default and are compared by structural equality.
type Person = {
 FirstName: string
 LastName: string
 Age: int

// Creating an instance of the record
let person = { FirstName = &quot;John&quot;; LastName = &quot;Doe&quot;; Age = 30 }

A Person class with a constructor taking a name and age and two immutable properties.

/// This is a documentation comment for a type definition.
type Person(name : string, age : int) =
 member x.Name = name
 member x.Age = age
/// class instantiation
let mrSmith = Person(&quot;Smith&quot;, 42)

A simple example that is often used to demonstrate the syntax of functional languages is the factorial function for non-negative 32-bit integers, here shown in F#:

/// Using pattern matching expression
let rec factorial n =
 match n with
 | 0 -&gt; 1
 | _ -&gt; n * factorial (n - 1)

/// For a single-argument functions there is syntactic sugar (pattern matching function):
let rec factorial = function 
 | 0 -&gt; 1 
 | n -&gt; n * factorial (n - 1)
/// Using fold and range operator
let factorial n = [1..n] |&gt; Seq.fold (*) 1
Iteration examples:

/// Iteration using a &#x27;for&#x27; loop
let printList lst = 
 for x in lst do
 printfn $&quot;{x}&quot; 

/// Iteration using a higher-order function
let printList2 lst = 
 List.iter (printfn &quot;%d&quot;) lst

/// Iteration using a recursive function and pattern matching
let rec printList3 lst =
 match lst with
 | h :: t -&gt;
 printfn &quot;%d&quot; h
 printList3 t

Fibonacci examples:

/// Fibonacci Number formula
[&lt;TailCall&gt;]
let fib n =
 let rec g n f0 f1 =
 match n with
 | 0 -&gt; f0
 | 1 -&gt; f1
 | _ -&gt; g (n - 1) f1 (f0 + f1)
 g n 0 1

/// Another approach - a lazy infinite sequence of Fibonacci numbers
let fibSeq = Seq.unfold (fun (a,b) -&gt; Some(a+b, (b, a+b))) (0,1)

// Print even fibs
[1 .. 10]
|&gt; List.map fib
|&gt; List.filter (fun n -&gt; (n % 2) = 0)
|&gt; printList

// Same thing, using a list expression
[ for i in 1..10 do
 let r = fib i
 if r % 2 = 0 then yield r ]
|&gt; printList

A sample Windows Forms program:

// Open the Windows Forms library
open System.Windows.Forms

// Create a window and set a few properties
let form = new Form(Visible=true, TopMost=true, Text=&quot;Welcome to F#&quot;)

// Create a label to show some text in the form
let label =
 let x = 3 + (4 * 5)
 new Label(Text = $&quot;{x}&quot;)

// Add the label to the form
form.Controls.Add(label)

// Finally, run the form
[&lt;System.STAThread&gt;]
Application.Run(form)

Asynchronous parallel programming sample (parallel CPU and I/O tasks):

/// A simple prime number detector
let isPrime (n:int) =
 let bound = int (sqrt (float n))
 seq {2 .. bound} |&gt; Seq.forall (fun x -&gt; n % x &lt;&gt; 0)

// We are using async workflows
let primeAsync n =
 async { return (n, isPrime n) }

/// Return primes between m and n using multiple threads
let primes m n =
 seq {m .. n}
 |&gt; Seq.map primeAsync
 |&gt; Async.Parallel
 |&gt; Async.RunSynchronously
 |&gt; Array.filter snd
 |&gt; Array.map fst

// Run a test
primes 1000000 1002000
 |&gt; Array.iter (printfn &quot;%d&quot;)

<text>Maximilian Maria Sforza (Italian: &quot;Massimiliano Maria Sforza&quot;; 25 January 1493 – 25 May 1530) was a Duke of Milan from the Sforza family, the son of Ludovico Sforza. 
==Biography==
When Maximilian was three his father tried to arrange a marriage between him and Mary Tudor, the younger daughter of King Henry VII of England. However, Henry VII rejected the proposal citing Mary&#x27;s young age as the issue. 

He was installed as a ruler of Milan in 1512 after the capture of Milan by the Holy League, supported by a Swiss militia led by Jakob Meyer zum Hasen. He ruled from 1512 to 1515, between the occupations of Louis XII of France (1500–1512), and Francis I of France in 1515. Francis I claimed the title of Duke of Milan, as he was descended from Louis I of Orléans and Valentine Visconti who were his great-grandparents. His claims were twofold because he married Claude, the daughter of Louis XII, who was also the great-granddaughter of Louis of Orléans and Valentine. 

After the French victory at the Battle of Marignano the arrival of the Venetians, under the command of Bartolomeo d&#x27;Alviano, transformed these indecisive battles into a terrible defeat for Matthew Schiner and his Swiss troops who lost 14,000 men. The survivors returned home to Switzerland, taking along the Duke&#x27;s young brother, Francesco II Sforza, who went to reside in Innsbruck under the guard of Emperor Maximilian I. 

The French entered Milan on 17 September 1515 and Maximilian surrendered 17 days later on 4 October. Francis I entered his new duchy on 11 October, accompanied by Charles III of Savoy and William IX of Montferrat who had pledged allegiance to him. The capitulation was complete and Maximilian was imprisoned by the returning French troops. and exiled to France with an annual annuity of 35,000 écus.

<doc id="239970" wikidata="Q1678246" url="?curid=239970" title="WASTE">
<text>WASTE is a peer-to-peer and friend-to-friend protocol and software application developed by Justin Frankel at Nullsoft in 2003 that features instant messaging, chat rooms, and file browsing/sharing capabilities. The name WASTE is a reference to Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s novel &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot;. In the novel, W.A.S.T.E. is (among other things) an underground postal service.

In 2003, less than 24 hours after its release, WASTE was removed from distribution by AOL, Nullsoft&#x27;s parent company. The original page was replaced with a statement claiming that the posting of the software was unauthorized and that no lawful rights to it were held by anyone who had downloaded it, in spite of the original claim that the software was released under the terms of the GNU General Public License.

Several developers have modified and upgraded the WASTE client and protocol. The SourceForge edition is considered by many to be the official development branch, but there are several forks.

== Description ==
WASTE is a decentralized chat, instant messaging and file sharing program and protocol. It behaves similarly to a virtual private network by connecting to a group of trusted computers, as determined by the users. This kind of network is commonly referred to as a darknet. It uses strong encryption to ensure that third parties cannot decipher the messages being transferred. The same encryption is used to transmit and receive instant messages, chat, and files, maintain the connection, and browse and search.

==WASTE networks ==
WASTE networks are decentralized (see social networks), meaning there is no central hub or server that everyone connects to. Peers must connect to each other individually. Normally, this is accomplished by having individuals sharing their RSA public keys, ensuring that their computers are accessible via the appropriate ports (one or more parties must have an IP address and port that can be reached by the other), and entering the IP address and port of someone on the network to connect to.

Once connected to the network, public keys are automatically exchanged amongst members (provided enough of the members are set to forward and accept public keys), and nodes will then attempt to connect to each other, strengthening the network (decreasing the odds that any one node going down will collapse or shut out any part of the network), as well as increasing the number of possible routes from any given point to any other point, decreasing latency and bandwidth required for communication and file transfer.

Since WASTE connects small, private groups rather than large, public ones, the network search feature is one of the fastest of all the decentralized P2P applications. Its instant messaging and file sharing capabilities are much closer to those of AOL Instant Messenger than more typical file sharing programs. Members of the network can create private and public chat rooms, instant message each other, browse each other&#x27;s files, and trade files, including the pushing or active sending of files by hosts, as well as the more common downloading by users. Simple drag-and-drop to chat boxes will send files to their intended destinations.

The suggested size for a WASTE network (referred to as a &quot;mesh&quot; by users) is 10-50 nodes, though it has been suggested that the size of the network is less critical than the ratio of nodes willing to route traffic to those that are not. With original Nullsoft-client groups now exceeding ten years of age, it&#x27;s not uncommon for stable meshes to host multiple terabytes of secure content.

By default, WASTE listens to incoming connections on port 1337. This was probably chosen because of 1337&#x27;s leet connotations.

Since there is no central hub, WASTE networks typically employ a password or passphrase, also called a &quot;network name&quot; to prevent collision. That is, a member from one network connecting to a member of another network, thus bridging the two networks. By assigning a unique identifier (passphrase) to your network, the risk of collisions can be reduced, particularly with the original clients.

== Nullnets ==
&quot;Nullnets&quot; are networks without a passphrase. It is impossible to know how many nullnets exist, but there is one primary nullnet. The best way to access the nullnet is to post your credentials to the WASTE Key Exchange. The nullnet can easily merge with other nullnets because there is no passphrase, which makes it a great place for public discussion and file sharing.

== Strengths ==
*Secured through the trade of RSA public keys, allowing for safe and secure communication and data transfer with trusted hosts.
*The distributed nature means that the network isn&#x27;t dependent on anyone setting up a server to act as a hub. Contrast this with other P2P and chat protocols that require you to connect to a server. This means there is no single point of vulnerability for the network.
*Similarly, there is no single group leader; everyone on the network is equal in what they can or cannot do, including inviting other members into the group, nor can any member kick another from the group, exclude them from public chats, etc.
*WASTE can obfuscate its protocol, making it difficult to detect that WASTE is being used.
*WASTE has a &quot;Saturate&quot; feature which adds random traffic, making traffic analysis more difficult.
*The nodes (each a trusted connection) automatically determine the lowest latency route for traffic and, in doing so, load balance. This also improves privacy, because packets often take different routes.

== Shortcomings ==
*Trading public keys, enabling port forwarding on your firewall (if necessary), and connecting to each other can be a difficult and/or tedious process, especially for those who aren&#x27;t very technically proficient.
*Due to the network&#x27;s distributed nature, it is impossible to &quot;kick&quot; someone from the network once they&#x27;ve gained access. Since every member of the network will have that member&#x27;s public key, all that member needs to do to regain access is to connect to another member. Coordinating the change of the network name is exceedingly difficult, so the best course of action is to create another network and migrate everyone over to the new network. This could, of course, also be seen as a strength.
*Since there is no central server, once someone disconnects from the network, they must know at least one network IP address to reconnect. It is possible that the network will drift from all the IP addresses used before so that none are known, and it becomes necessary to contact a network member and ask for address information to be able to reconnect. Indeed, it is possible that a network could unknowingly split into two this way. It takes at least some coordination to keep a WASTE network intact; this can be as simple as one or more volunteers with a static IP address or a fixed dynamic DNS (DDNS) address (available free of charge from a number of providers) keeping their node up to allow people to reconnect to the network.
*While encryption is performed using the Blowfish algorithm, which is thought to be strong, the PCBC mode used has several known security flaws.
*Nicknames are not &quot;registered&quot;, which allows eavesdropping and spoofing. WASTE version 1.6 reduces the chances of eavesdropping by using public keys for communication, but as network members may choose any nickname a user must know and recognize the hash of the person they wish to communicate with to be sure of their identity.
*To connect from behind a firewall, one party must have the proper port forwarded to their computer; as WASTE networks do not depend on a central server there is no way around this. However, as long as one node accepts incoming connections it can act as a server, connecting nodes that cannot themselves accept incoming connections. Indeed, the long-term stability of a WASTE network depends on these hubs.

== Versions ==
As of version 1.7, WASTE comes in an experimental and a stable release. The experimental branch implements a new 16k packet size, which improves overhead and transfer speeds, but is not compatible with previous versions which support a 4k packet size.

WASTE 1.7.4 for Windows was released on 24 December 2008, and was current . This is a new branch on SourceForge created because of inactivity on the main WASTE development branch. This is the most fully featured version to date.

A cross-platform (including Linux, OS X, and Microsoft Windows) beta version of WASTE called Waste 1.5 beta 4 a.k.a. wxWaste, using the WxWidgets toolkit is available.

VIA Technologies released a fork of WASTE under the name PadlockSL, but removed the product&#x27;s website after a few weeks. The user interface was written in Qt and the client was available for Linux and Windows.

BlackBelt WASTE is a released fork of WASTE. Its build is labelled 1.8 to mark its significant improvements across its various areas of functionality. It supports Tor and i2p networks as well as clearnet. Its routing has been updated to provide even more obfuscated meta-data internally. It has uPnP support to automatically handle port forwarding. It also has automatic Anti-Spoofing Technology to encourage unique users. Since May 2023, it also contains Conference VoIP. Under development since 2010, it currently (May 2023) has regular releases and improvements.

<doc id="239972" wikidata="Q208826" url="?curid=239972" title="Height">
<text>Height is measure of vertical distance, either vertical extent (how &quot;tall&quot; something or someone is) or vertical position (how &quot;high&quot; a point is). For an example of vertical extent, &quot;This basketball player is 7 foot 1 inches in height.&quot; For an example of vertical position, &quot;The height of an airplane in-flight is about 10,000 meters.&quot;

When the term is used to describe vertical position (of, e.g., an airplane) from sea level, height is more often called &quot;altitude&quot;.
Furthermore, if the point is attached to the Earth (e.g., a mountain peak), then altitude (height above sea level) is called &quot;elevation&quot;.

In a two-dimensional Cartesian space, height is measured along the vertical axis (&quot;y&quot;) between a specific point and another that does not have the same &quot;y&quot;-value. If both points happen to have the same &quot;y&quot;-value, then their relative height is zero. In the case of three-dimensional space, height is measured along the vertical &quot;z&quot; axis, describing a distance from (or &quot;above&quot;) the &quot;x-y&quot; plane.

==Etymology==
The English-language word &quot;high&quot; is derived from Old English &quot;hēah&quot;, ultimately from Proto-Germanic *&quot;xauxa-z&quot;, from a PIE base &quot;*keuk-&quot;. The derived noun &quot;height&quot;, also the obsolete forms &quot;heighth&quot; and &quot;highth&quot;, is from Old English &quot;híehþo&quot;, later &quot;héahþu&quot;, as it were from Proto-Germanic &quot;*xaux-iþa&quot;.

==In mathematics==
In elementary models of space, height may indicate the third dimension, the other two being length and width. Height is normal to the plane formed by the length and width.

Height is also used as a name for some more abstract definitions. These include:
#The height or altitude of a triangle, which is the length from a vertex of a triangle to the line formed by the opposite side;
#The height of a pyramid, which is the smallest distance from the apex to the base;
#A measurement in a circular segment of the distance from the midpoint of the arc of the circular segment to the midpoint of the line joining the endpoints of the arc (see diagram in circular segment);
#In a rooted tree, the height of a vertex is the length of the longest downward path to a leaf from that vertex;
#In algebraic number theory, a &quot;height function&quot; is a measurement related to the minimal polynomial of an algebraic number; among other uses in commutative algebra and representation theory;
#In ring theory, the height of a prime ideal is the supremum of the lengths of all chains of prime ideals contained in it.

Although height is normally relative to a plane of reference, most measurements of height in the physical world are based upon a zero surface, known as sea level. Both altitude and elevation, two synonyms for height, are usually defined as the position of a point above the mean sea level. One can extend the sea-level surface under the continents: naively, one can imagine a lot of narrow canals through the continents. In practice, the sea level under a continent has to be computed from gravity measurements, and slightly different computational methods exist; see Geodesy, heights.

In addition to vertical position, the vertical extent of geographic landmarks can be defined in terms of topographic prominence. For example, the highest mountain (by elevation in reference to sea level) belongs to Mount Everest, located on the border of Nepal and Tibet, China; however the tallest mountain, by measurement of apex to base, is Mauna Kea in Hawaii, United States.

===In geodesy===
Geodesists formalize mean sea level (MSL) by means of the geoid, the equipotential surface that best fits MSL. Then various types of height (normal, dynamic, orthometric, etc.) can be defined, based on the assumption of density of topographic masses necessary in the continuation of MSL under the continents.

A purely geometric quantity is the &quot;ellipsoidal height&quot;, reckoned from the surface of a reference ellipsoid, see Geodetic system, vertical datum.

==In aviation==

In aviation terminology, the terms &quot;height&quot;, &quot;altitude&quot;, and &quot;elevation&quot; are not synonyms. Usually, the altitude of an aircraft is measured from sea level, while its height is measured from ground level. Elevation is also measured from sea level, but is most often regarded as a property of the ground. Thus, elevation plus height can equal altitude, but the term &quot;altitude&quot; has several meanings in aviation.

==In human culture==
Human height is one of the areas of study within anthropometry. While environmental factors have some effect on variations in human height, these influences are insufficient to account for all differences between populations, suggesting that genetic factors are important for explaining variations between human populations.

The United Nations uses height (among other statistics) to monitor changes in the nutrition of developing nations. In human populations, average height can distill down complex data about the group&#x27;s birth, upbringing, social class, diet, and health care system.

In their research, Baten, Stegl and van der Eng came to the conclusion that a change in the average height is a sign for a change in the economic development. With broad data of Indonesia, the researchers state that several incidents in the history of the country has led not only to a change in the economy but also to a change in the population&#x27;s average height.

<text>A stirrup is a light frame or ring that holds the foot of a rider, attached to the saddle by a strap, often called a &quot;stirrup leather&quot;. Stirrups are usually paired and are used to aid in mounting and as a support while using a riding animal (usually a horse or other equine, such as a mule). They greatly increase the rider&#x27;s ability to stay in the saddle and control the mount, increasing the animal&#x27;s usefulness to humans in areas such as communication, transportation, and warfare.

In antiquity, the earliest foot supports consisted of riders placing their feet under a girth or using a simple toe loop appearing in India by the 2nd century BC. Later, a single foot support was used as a mounting aid, and paired stirrups appeared after the invention of the treed saddle. The stirrup was invented in the Chinese Jin dynasty during the 4th century, was in common use throughout China by the 5th century, and was spread across Eurasia to Europe through the nomadic peoples of Central Eurasia by the 7th or 8th century.

==Etymology==
The English word &quot;stirrup&quot; stems from Old English &quot;stirap, stigrap&quot;, Middle English &quot;stirop, styrope&quot;, i.e. a mounting or climbing-rope. Compare Old English &quot;stīgan&quot; &quot;to ascend&quot; and &quot;rap&quot; &quot;rope, cord&quot;.

==History==
The stirrup, which gives greater stability to a rider, has been described as one of the most significant inventions in the history of warfare, prior to gunpowder. As a tool allowing expanded use of horses in warfare, the stirrup is often called the third revolutionary step in equipment, after the chariot and the saddle. The basic tactics of mounted warfare were significantly altered by the stirrup. A rider supported by stirrups was less likely to fall off while fighting, and could deliver a blow with a weapon that more fully employed the weight and momentum of horse and rider. Among other advantages, stirrups provided greater balance and support to the rider, which allowed the knight to use a sword more efficiently without falling, especially against infantry adversaries. Contrary to common modern belief, however, it has been asserted that stirrups actually did not enable the horseman to use a lance more effectively (cataphracts had used lances since antiquity), though the cantled saddle did.

===Precursors===

==== Soft stirrups ====
The invention of the stirrup occurred relatively late in history, considering that horses were domesticated in approximately 4000 BC, and the earliest known saddle-like equipment were fringed cloths or pads with breast pads and cruppers used by Assyrian cavalry around 700 BC.

The earliest hard foot support was a toe loop that held the big toe and was used in India late in the second century BC, though it may have appeared as early as 500 BC. This ancient foot support consisted of a looped rope for the big toe which was at the bottom of a saddle made of fibre or leather. Such a configuration was suitable for the warm climate of south and central India where people used to ride horses barefoot. Buddhist carvings in the temples of Sanchi, Mathura and the Bhaja caves dating back between the 1st and 2nd century BC feature horsemen riding with elaborate saddles with toes slipped under girths. Archaeologist John Marshall described the Sanchi relief as &quot;the earliest example by some five centuries of the use of stirrups in any part of the world&quot;. This type of foot support has been called the &quot;toe stirrup&quot; in contrast to the later stirrup known as the &quot;foot stirrup&quot; seen in China during the 5th century AD. It is speculated that they may have spread to China and were the precursors of the &quot;foot stirrup&quot;.

==== Hard stirrups ====
Riders in Central and Southern Asia during the last century B.C. and the first century A.D. seem to have used toe loops and &quot;hook stirrups,&quot; which featured a curved metal hook hanging from the saddle to support the foot. A pair of first century BC double bent iron bars, approximately 17 cm in length with curvature at each end, excavated from a grave near Junapani in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, have been postulated as either full foot stirrups or bridle bits.

Some credit the nomadic Central Asian group known as the Sarmatians with developing the first stirrups.

The invention of the solid saddle tree allowed development of the true stirrup as it is known today. Without a solid tree, the rider&#x27;s weight in the stirrups creates abnormal pressure points that make the horse&#x27;s back sore. Modern thermography studies on &quot;treeless&quot; and flexible-tree saddle designs have found that there is considerable friction across the center line of a horse&#x27;s back. A coin of Quintus Labienus, who was in service of Parthia, minted circa 39 BC depicts on its reverse a saddled horse with hanging objects. Smith suggests they are pendant cloths, while Thayer suggests that, considering the fact that the Parthians were famous for their mounted archery, the objects are stirrups, but adds that it is difficult to imagine why the Romans would never have adopted the technology.

===East Asia===

The &quot;Wenwu&quot; journal (1981) speculated that stirrups may have been used in China as early as the Han dynasty (206 BC–220 AD) based on representations of horses believed to date to the Eastern Han period (25–220 AD). Two plaques depict horses with squares between their belly and base line, which has been speculated to represent stirrups. However in 1984, Yang Hong remarked in the same journal that the horses had no saddles and therefore the squares were only ornaments.

Excavations at Khukh Nuur in northern Mongolia discovered a single iron stirrup in a cave burial. Radiocarbon dating of the human bone associated with this stirrup produced a date of 243–405 cal AD. Another cave burial at Urd Ulaan Uneet in Khovd Province was discovered with a saddle that had bilateral straps attached midway through the saddle tree, strongly suggesting the existence of paired stirrups. Radiocarbon dating of a strap made with horse hide gives a date of 267–535 cal AD.

The earliest known paired stirrups first appeared in China during the Jin dynasty by the early 4th century AD. A funerary figurine depicting a stirrup dated 302 AD was unearthed from a Western Jin tomb near Changsha. The stirrup depicted is a mounting stirrup, only placed on one side of the horse, and too short for riding. The earliest reliable representation of a full-length, double-sided riding stirrup was also unearthed from a Jin tomb, this time near Nanjing, dating to the Eastern Jin period, 322 AD. The earliest extant double stirrups were discovered in the tomb of a Northern Yan noble, Feng Sufu, who died in 415 AD. These stirrups were made with mulberry wood gilded with bronze and iron plates. References to stirrups appeared in Chinese texts by the end of the 4th century. Stirrups have also been found in Goguryeo tombs dating to the 4th and 5th centuries AD, but these do not contain any specific date. The stirrup appears to have been in widespread use across China by 477 AD.

The appearance of the stirrup in China coincided with the rise of heavily armoured cavalry in the region. Dated to 357 AD, the tomb of Dong Shou shows fully armoured riders as well as horses. References to &quot;iron cavalry&quot; and &quot;iron horse&quot; began to appear at the same time and instances of captured horse armour in numbers as high as 5,000 and 10,000 are recorded. In addition to the stirrups, Feng Sufu&#x27;s tomb also contained iron plates for lamellar armour. Armoured heavy cavalry would dominate Chinese warfare from the 4th century AD to the early Tang dynasty when the military transitioned to light cavalry. A. von Le Coo&#x27;s theory on the invention of the stirrup is that it was a contraption created by either mounted people who wanted to make riding less tiring, or those unused to riding to gain the necessary skills to match their adversaries.

The earliest stirrups in Japan were unearthed from 5th century tombs. They were flat bottomed rings of metal-covered wood. Cup-shaped stirrups () that enclosed the front half of the rider&#x27;s foot replaced the earlier design. During the Nara period, the base of the stirrup which supported the rider&#x27;s sole was elongated past the toe cup. This half-tongued style of stirrup () remained in use until the late Heian period when the or replaced it. It had a base that extended the full length of the rider&#x27;s foot and the right and left sides of the toe cup were removed. The open sides were designed to prevent the rider from catching a foot in the stirrup and being dragged. The military version () of this stirrup was in use by the middle Heian period. It was thinner, had a deeper toe pocket, and a longer and flatter foot shelf. This stirrup stayed in use until European style-stirrup rings were reintroduced in the late 19th century. It is not known why the Japanese developed this unique style of stirrup. These had a distinctive swanlike shape, curved up and backward at the front so as to bring the loop for the leather strap over the instep and achieve a correct balance. Most of the surviving specimens from this period are made entirely of iron, inlaid with designs of silver or other materials, and covered with lacquer. In some examples there is an iron rod from the loop to the footplate near the heel to prevent the foot from slipping out. The footplates are occasionally perforated to let water drain out when crossing rivers, and these types are called . There are stirrups with holes in the front forming sockets for a lance or banner.

In the 6th century AD and later, earlier wooden and composite stirrups were replaced with cast iron versions in East Asia.

===Europe===

By the late 6th or early 7th century AD, primarily due to invaders from Central Asia, such as the Avars, stirrups began spreading across Asia to Europe from China. The iron pear-shaped form of stirrups, the ancestor of medieval European types, has been found in Europe in 7th century Avar graves in Hungary. A total of 111 specimens of early Avar-age, apple shaped, cast-iron stirrups with elongated suspension loop and flat, slightly inward bent tread had been excavated from 55 burial sites in Hungary and surrounding regions by 2005. The first European literary reference to the stirrup may be in the Strategikon, traditionally ascribed to the Roman emperor Maurice, and therefore written sometime between 575 and 628, but this is widely disputed, and others place the work in the eighth or ninth century. Maurice&#x27;s manual notes the appropriate equipping of imperial cavalry: &quot;the saddles should have large and thick clothes; the bridles should be of good quality; attached to the saddles should be two iron steps [&quot;skala&quot;], a lasso with a thong&quot;. Dennis notes that the lack of specific Greek word for stirrup evidences their novelty to the Byzantines, who are supposed to have adopted these from their bitter enemy the Avars, and subsequently passed them on to their future enemies, the Arabs. An early 7th-century date is secured for most Hungarian finds of stirrups with elongated suspension loops, though some of these must even be dated to before 600. Literary and archaeological evidence taken together may indicate that the stirrup was in common military use in South-Central Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean by the latter half of the 6th century, with the Roman Empire having them in use by the year 600.

By the 8th century stirrups began to be adopted more widely by Europeans. The earliest stirrups of western Europe, those of Budenheim and Regensburg, were either brought from the Avar Khaganate as booty or gifts, or were local imitations of stirrups in use at that time among Avar warriors. However, the Avar-style stirrups were not as widely adopted in western Europe. Stirrups do not appear in the Merovingian and Italo-Lombard milieu in large numbers, nor as frequently as within the Carpathian Basin. Most other stirrups found in Germany that date to the 7th century do not resemble the iron Avar style commonly found in burial assemblages from Hungary and neighboring regions. Instead, hanging mounts occasionally found in burial assemblages in southern Germany suggest the use of wooden stirrups. The scarcity of early-medieval stirrup finds in western Europe was noted by Bernard Bachrach: &quot;Out of 704 eighth century male burials excavated in Germany until 1967, only 13 had stirrups.&quot;

The earliest stirrups in the Baltic region are replicas of those in existence in Germany during the 7th century. In Northern Europe and Britain the metamorphosis of earlier wood, rope and leather forms of stirrups to metal forms can be seen in the archeological record, &quot;suggesting that one or more of the early forms have parallel development with those in Hungary, rather than being derived solely from the latter region&quot;. &quot;In Scandinavia two major types of stirrups are discerned, and from these, by the development and fusion of different elements, some almost certainly of central European origin, most other types were evolved.&quot; The first main type, Scandinavian type I, appears to owe little to Hungarian forms. The earliest variety of this type can be dated to the 8th century in Vendel grave III in Sweden. The second principal type in Northern Europe has, as its most characteristic feature, a pronounced rectangular suspension loop set in the same plane as the bow, as found amongst the Hungarian examples, and is predominantly centered in Denmark and England during the later 10th and 11th centuries. A variant of this type, called the north European stirrup, has been dated to the second half of the 10th century in Sweden, found at the boat-burial cemetery at Valsgärde.
In Denmark from the 920s to the 980s, during the reign of the Jelling kings, many leading Danes were buried with military honors and equipped with stirrups, bits and spurs, in what are called cavalry-graves, found mostly in north Jutland. Into England, it is argued, stirrups were not introduced by the Scandinavian settlers of the 9th century but are more likely related to later Viking raids led by Cnut the Great and others during the reign of King Aethelred (978–1013).

In what today is France, Charles Martel distributed seized lands to his retainers on condition that they serve him by fighting in the new manner, which some attribute to his recognizing the military potentialities of the stirrup. Later, Charlemagne ordered his poorer vassals to pool their resources and provide a mounted and armed knight, though the system proved unworkable, and instead the system of distributing land to vassals based on a knight&#x27;s service was developed.

===West Africa===
Accounts of the Empire of Mali mention the use of stirrups and saddles in the cavalry. Stirrups resulted in the creation and innovation of new tactics, such as mass charges with thrusting spear and swords.

===Great Stirrup Controversy===

Some scholars credit the birth of feudalism and its subsequent spread into Northern Italy, Spain, Germany and into the Slavic territories to the stirrup: &quot;Few inventions have been so simple as the stirrup, but few have had so catalytic an influence on history. The requirements of the new mode of warfare which it made possible found expression in a new form of western European society dominated by an aristocracy of warriors endowed with land so that they might fight in a new and highly specialized way.&quot;

Other scholars dispute this assertion, suggesting that stirrups may provide little advantage in shock warfare, but are useful primarily in allowing a rider to lean farther to the left and right on the saddle while fighting, and simply reduce the risk of falling off. Therefore, it is argued, they are not the reason for the switch from infantry to cavalry in medieval armies, nor the reason for the emergence of feudalism.

==Weaknesses in design==
For the comfort of the horse, all stirrups require that the saddle itself be properly designed. The solid tree of the saddle distributes the weight of the rider over a greater surface area of the horse&#x27;s back, reducing pressure on any one area. If a saddle is made without a solid tree, without careful engineering, the rider&#x27;s weight in the stirrups and leathers can create pressure points on the horse&#x27;s back and lead to soreness. This is especially noticeable with inexpensive bareback pads that add stirrups by means of a strap across the horse&#x27;s back with a stirrup at each end.

==Modern stirrups==
===English-style stirrups===

Stirrups used on English saddles are usually made of metal. Though called &quot;irons,&quot; they are no longer made of iron, as a rule, but instead stainless steel is the alloy of choice, due to its strength, though when weight is an issue, such as for a jockey, they may also be made of aluminum. Inexpensive stirrups may be made of nickel, which can easily bend or break. Stirrups may also be made of synthetic materials and various metallic alloys. There are many variations on the standard stirrup design, most claiming either to be safer in the event of a fall or to make it easier for a rider to maintain a proper foot and leg position.

Some variations include:
* Standard iron: The most common stirrup iron, consisting of a tread, with two branches, and an eye at the top for the leather to run through. The main styles seen today include:
** Fillis: A design with a heavy tread, and branches that rise to the eye in a rounded triangular shape.
** Prussian: A rounder and lighter design.
* Safety stirrups. There are a number of designs intended to release the foot more easily in the event of a fall. One style has an outside branch that is curved, rather than straight. Other designs feature a breakaway outer branch which will detach with sufficient pressure, freeing the foot.
* Side-saddle stirrups: usually have a slightly larger eye to accommodate the thicker stirrup leather on a sidesaddle.
* Other designs: have joints or hinges in the branches of the stirrups to allow for them to flex. However, one model was recalled in 2007 due to a tendency for the hinges to break. A variation on the hinged stirrup is the Icelandic Stirrup, which has the eye fixed at a 90 degree rotation to allow for less stress on the tendons, and easier retrieval should a stirrup be lost. There are a number of other patented designs with various features that are usually intended to either increase comfort or to assist proper foot position.

<text>La Géométrie () was published in 1637 as an appendix to &quot;Discours de la méthode&quot; (&quot;Discourse on the Method&quot;), written by René Descartes. In the &quot;Discourse&quot;, Descartes presents his method for obtaining clarity on any subject. &quot;La Géométrie&quot; and two other appendices, also by Descartes, &quot;La Dioptrique&quot; (&quot;Optics&quot;) and &quot;Les Météores&quot; (&quot;Meteorology&quot;), were published with the &quot;Discourse&quot; to give examples of the kinds of successes he had achieved following his method (as well as, perhaps, considering the contemporary European social climate of intellectual competitiveness, to show off a bit to a wider audience).

The work was the first to propose the idea of uniting algebra and geometry into a single subject and invented an algebraic geometry called analytic geometry, which involves reducing geometry to a form of arithmetic and algebra and translating geometric shapes into algebraic equations. For its time this was ground-breaking. It also contributed to the mathematical ideas of Leibniz and Newton and was thus important in the development of calculus.

==The text==
This appendix is divided into three &quot;books&quot;. 

Book I is titled &quot;Problems Which Can Be Constructed by Means of Circles and Straight Lines Only.&quot; In this book he introduces algebraic notation that is still in use today. The letters at the end of the alphabet, viz., , , , etc. are to denote unknown variables, while those at the start of the alphabet, , , , etc. denote constants. He introduces modern exponential notation for powers (except for squares, where he kept the older tradition of writing repeated letters, such as, ). He also breaks with the Greek tradition of associating powers with geometric referents, with an area, with a volume and so on, and treats them all as possible lengths of line segments. These notational devices permit him to describe an association of numbers to lengths of line segments that could be constructed with straightedge and compass. The bulk of the remainder of this book is occupied by Descartes&#x27;s solution to &quot;the locus problems of Pappus.&quot; According to Pappus, given three or four lines in a plane, the problem is to find the locus of a point that moves so that the product of the distances from two of the fixed lines (along specified directions) is proportional to the square of the distance to the third line (in the three line case) or proportional to the product of the distances to the other two lines (in the four line case). In solving these problems and their generalizations, Descartes takes two line segments as unknown and designates them and . Known line segments are designated , , , etc. The germinal idea of a Cartesian coordinate system can be traced back to this work.

In the second book, called &quot;On the Nature of Curved Lines&quot;, Descartes described two kinds of curves, called by him &quot;geometrical&quot; and &quot;mechanical&quot;. Geometrical curves are those which are now described by algebraic equations in two variables, however, Descartes described them kinematically and an essential feature was that &quot;all&quot; of their points could be obtained by construction from lower order curves. This represented an expansion beyond what was permitted by straightedge and compass constructions. Other curves like the quadratrix and spiral, where only some of whose points could be constructed, were termed mechanical and were not considered suitable for mathematical study. Descartes also devised an algebraic method for finding the normal at any point of a curve whose equation is known. The construction of the tangents to the curve then easily follows and Descartes applied this algebraic procedure for finding tangents to several curves. 

The third book, &quot;On the Construction of Solid and Supersolid Problems&quot;, is more properly algebraic than geometric and concerns the nature of equations and how they may be solved. He recommends that all terms of an equation be placed on one side and set equal to 0 to facilitate solution. He points out the factor theorem for polynomials and gives an intuitive proof that a polynomial of degree has roots. He systematically discussed negative and imaginary roots of equations and explicitly used what is now known as Descartes&#x27; rule of signs.

==Aftermath==
Descartes wrote &quot;La Géométrie&quot; in French rather than the language used for most scholarly publication at the time, Latin. His exposition style was far from clear, the material was not arranged in a systematic manner and he generally only gave indications of proofs, leaving many of the details to the reader. His attitude toward writing is indicated by statements such as &quot;I did not undertake to say everything,&quot; or &quot;It already wearies me to write so much about it,&quot; that occur frequently. Descartes justifies his omissions and obscurities with the remark that much was deliberately omitted &quot;in order to give others the pleasure of discovering [it] for themselves.&quot;

Descartes is often credited with inventing the coordinate plane because he had the relevant concepts in his book, however, nowhere in &quot;La Géométrie&quot; does the modern rectangular coordinate system appear. This and other improvements were added by mathematicians who took it upon themselves to clarify and explain Descartes&#x27; work.

This enhancement of Descartes&#x27; work was primarily carried out by Frans van Schooten, a professor of mathematics at Leiden and his students. Van Schooten published a Latin version of &quot;La Géométrie&quot; in 1649 and this was followed by three other editions in 1659−1661, 1683 and 1693. The 1659−1661 edition was a two volume work more than twice the length of the original filled with explanations and examples provided by van Schooten and his students. One of these students, Johannes Hudde provided a convenient method for determining double roots of a polynomial, known as Hudde&#x27;s rule, that had been a difficult procedure in Descartes&#x27;s method of tangents. These editions established analytic geometry in the seventeenth century.

<doc id="239982" wikidata="Q764793" url="?curid=239982" title="Battle of Fornovo">
<text>The Battle of Fornovo took place 30 km (19 miles) southwest of the city of Parma on 6 July 1495. It was fought as King Charles VIII of France left Naples upon hearing the news of the grand coalition assembled against him. Despite the numerical advantage of their opponents, the French won the engagement and Charles was able to march his army out of Italy. It was nonetheless devoid of any strategic result as all of their conquests in the Italian Peninsula were abandoned. Fornovo was the first major pitched battle of the Italian Wars.

==Antecedents==
In the year 1495, Charles VIII was the youthful King of France, the most powerful state in medieval Europe. A dreamer who saw himself as the saviour of Christian Europe, he believed he could roll-back the ever-spreading tide of Ottoman Turkish conquest. As a base for his crusade, he was determined to seize Southern Italy. His claim on the Kingdom of Naples through his paternal grandmother, Marie of Anjou (1404–1463) presented such an opportunity.

To have his hands free in Italy, Charles made various pacts with his neighbours, so they would not interfere. Henry VII of England was given cash, Ferdinand II of Aragon was given Roussillon and Emperor Maximillian was given Artois and Franche-Comté. This handing out of territory could be regarded as a total lack of foresight on Charles&#x27; behalf but he was willing to take such steps to establish his Neapolitan base for his crusade.

==Campaign==
Charles VIII was on good terms with the two powers in northern Italy, Milan and Venice, and both had encouraged his claim over the Kingdom of Naples. Thus he assumed he would have their support when he moved against Alfonso II of Naples, especially as the rival claimant was Ferdinand II of Aragon, King of Spain. At the end of August 1494, in a lightning campaign, he used France&#x27;s powerful modern army, reinforced by a large contingent of Swiss mercenaries, to sweep through Italy, his mobile field artillery train smashing into dust the tall towers of Italy&#x27;s medieval castles. He was granted free passage through Milan, but was vigorously opposed by Florence, Pope Alexander VI, and Naples.

On 22 February 1495 Charles VIII and his chief commander, Louis II de La Trémoille, entered Naples almost without opposition. The speed and violence of the campaign left the Italians stunned. Realization struck them, especially the Venetians and the new Duke of Milan, Ludovico Sforza, that unless Charles was stopped Italy would soon just be another province of France. The Italian states rallied and on March 31 in Venice, the Holy League was proclaimed. The signatories were the Republic of Venice, the Duke of Milan, the Pope, the monarchs of Castile and Aragon, the King of England and the Holy Roman Emperor.

==Retreat==
The League engaged a veteran condottiero, Francesco II of Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua to gather an army and expel the French from Italy. Upon hearing the news of the coalition assembled against him, Charles VIII left behind a garrisoning force in Naples and marched north with the remainder of his army, his artillery train and the considerable booty seized in the campaign thus far in order to join a smaller army under Louis II, Duke of Orléans in Piedmont in north-western Italy.
On 27 June the Venetians and their allies established camp near Fornovo di Taro (), some 30 km southwest of Parma, to wait for the French. They would not have to wait long, but the Venetian Senate was not unanimous on fighting the French. Some members wanted to attack the rear guard of the French to try to seize their loot, while others cautioned that Italy was risking too much in this battle as this was just one French army and others could potentially be called upon.

On July 4, Ercole d&#x27;Este, Duke of Ferrara, Charles&#x27; strongest ally in Italy, wrote to him and informed him that the Senate had not yet decided on an action. But Charles was anxious, seeing the enemy numbers growing, while he himself had no hope of reinforcements for the time being. When an effort to sway the undecided forces of Parma was thwarted by the Venetians, Charles instead sent a messenger to request free passage to return to France, but the Venetians replied that he would have to restore all his conquests before such could be considered. The messenger, having scouted the troops, reported back to Charles. The 40 soldiers Charles subsequently sent to reconnoiter were attacked and quickly routed by the Stradioti, mostly Albanian mercenaries from the Balkans.

Two days later, on July 6, Charles decided to offer battle because the French were short of provisions. South of Milan, the path of his army of some 10,000 French and Swiss was blocked by 20,000 Venetians and Mantuans under Gonzaga. Melchiorre Trevisan promised the League soldiers the spoils of battle if they were victorious, igniting their combat ardor. Francesco Gonzaga divided his forces into nine lines. His battle plan was to distract the first and middle groups of the French with two lines while outflanking the rear. Once the French groups were disorganized, the rest of the Italian troops would attack. The League&#x27;s overall goal was the complete destruction of the French army.

==Battle==
The League army took position on the right side of the Taro river and the French decided to keep to the left bank. Charles organized his army in battle groups. The first section consisted of about 2,500 men and was led by Marshal Gie and Gian Giacomo Trivulzio. The second and largest section, led by Englebert of Cleves and Antoine de Bessey, consisted of 3000 infantry, 300 dismounted archers and 200 crossbowman. The final section, about 1,750 men, was led by Jean de Foix. There was in addition a large infantry force of spearmen. The French artillery was arranged in front of the first line, as well as on the side of the Taro, protecting the second line. The League&#x27;s right wing was commanded by Count Caiazzo with 400 Milanes men-at-arms and 2000 infantry, with 180 Bolognese men-at-arms in reserve. The central division consisted of 492 men-at-arms and 600 mounted crossbowmen under the command of Francesco Gonzaga, while keeping a large contingent of cavalry in reserve. The left wing, commanded by Fortebraccio di Montone, had 352 Venetian men-at-arms supported by cavalry. Also in the center were 4,000 Venetian foot and 1,000 Mantuan infantry, with a contingent of 600 Stradioti on the French left flank.

The French opened with an artillery bombardment, intending to kill as many of their opponents as possible. Then they charged with their heavy cavalry, destroying and scattering the disordered Italian ranks in just minutes. The fight was perhaps more memorable for the ineffectiveness of artillery on either side, other than the psychological effect achieved by the French guns. Of the French and Italian casualties, one eyewitness estimated that fewer than 10 men were killed by cannon fire.

After the battle, Charles then marched on into Lombardy and returned to France.

==Result==
Both parties strove to present themselves as the victors in the battle. The battle was reported in Venice as a victory, and was recorded and celebrated as such, which included the capture of Mathieu de Bourbon. Regardless of the self-proclamations of victory by League commanders, Domenico Malipiero recognized that the League failed to stop the French from reaching Asti. Francesco Gonzaga claimed victory and the ordered the portrait of the &quot;Madonna della Vittoria&quot;, while the Italian historian Francesco Guicciardini&#x27;s judgement was to award the palm of victory to the French. Privately, Gonzaga confessed to his wife that the battle was a near run thing and that if the French had turned on them, the League&#x27;s forces would have been destroyed. A week later, Bernardino Fortebraccio spoke to the Venetian senate, stating the League&#x27;s army could have defeated the French if their troops would have stayed in the battle and left the baggage train alone.

The French had won their battle, fighting off superior numbers and proceeding on their march to Asti. The League took much higher casualties and could not prevent the French army from crossing Italian lands on its way back to France.

==Consequences==
On the same day as the battle was fought, Ferdinand II appeared before Naples with a Spanish fleet; he re-entered and occupied Naples the following day. He was welcomed with rejoicing by the citizens, as the French had made themselves hated through their behaviour. Pope Alexander VI denounced the French as having committed worse crimes in Italy than had the Goths. Already under threat of excommunication, Charles VIII was ordered to lay down his arms and promote the peace of Christendom by the pope. Alexander also wrote to the Venetians to congratulate them on winning &quot;immortal fame&quot; by their liberation of Italy.

Charles left Italy abandoning all his conquests. He attempted in the next few years to rebuild his army, but was hampered by the serious debts incurred by the previous one, and he never succeeded in recouping anything substantive. He died two-and-a-half years after his retreat, of an accident, striking his head while passing through a doorway, he succumbed to a sudden coma several hours later.

Charles bequeathed a meagre legacy: he left France in debt and in disarray as a result of an ambition most charitably characterized as unrealistic, and having lost several important provinces that it would take centuries to recover. On a more positive side, his expedition did broaden contacts between French and Italian humanists, energizing French art and letters in the latter Renaissance.

Charles proved to be the last of the elder branch of the House of Valois, and upon his death at Amboise the throne passed to a cousin, the Duc d&#x27;Orléans, who reigned as King Louis XII of France, who would try to make good his clearer claim to the Duchy of Milan.

However, for Italy the consequences were catastrophic. Europe knew now, from Charles&#x27; expedition, of an enormously rich land, divided into easily conquerable principalities, and defended only by mercenary armies that refused to fight with the slightest disadvantage. Italy was to be the scene of a dispute between the main continental powers, with the result that the Italians were left with only a secondary role in their own destiny. Only Venice, Genoa, the Papal States, Savoy, and Tuscany would survive as independent nations after the end of the Italian Wars, losing however their original power and stability.

<text>The Ems dispatch (, ), sometimes called the Ems telegram, was published on 13 July 1870; it incited the Second French Empire to declare war on the Kingdom of Prussia on 19 July 1870, starting the Franco-Prussian War. The actual dispatch was an internal telegram sent by Heinrich Abeken from Prussian King Wilhelm I&#x27;s vacationing site at Ems to Otto von Bismarck in Berlin, describing demands made by the French ambassador concerning the Spanish succession. Bismarck, the chancellor of the North German Confederation, released a statement to the press, stirring up emotions in both France and Germany.

The name referred to Bad Ems, a resort spa east of Koblenz on the Lahn river, then in Hesse-Nassau, a new possession of Prussia.

== Background ==
The Austro-Prussian War, from 16 June to 23 August 1866, which involved south and north German states on both sides as well as the emerging Italy, increased Prussia&#x27;s power. Austria was defeated in the key Battle of Königgrätz (or Sadowa) on 3 July 1866. The preliminary Peace of Nikolsburg, 26 July, was followed by the Peace of Prague, 23 August. Bismarck thus managed to expel Austria from the German Confederation, to set up and dominate the North German Confederation (north of the Main) and to secure Prussian territorial gains. Hanover, Schleswig-Holstein, Nassau and Hesse-Cassel, and Frankfurt were incorporated into Prussia, whose territory expanded thus by nearly a quarter and its population by more than 4 million to roughly 24 million, which was still less than France&#x27;s 38 million. France did not take part in the war, which was brief but altered the European balance of power, and did not gain territories or prestige. French demands for a &quot;revanche pour Sadova&quot; (&quot;revenge for Sadowa&quot;) took root.

In early 1870, the German Prince Leopold, of the Roman Catholic cadet branch Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, had been offered the vacant Spanish throne. French Emperor Napoleon III and his government voiced concern over a possible Spanish alliance with the Protestant House of Hohenzollern, which ruled the Kingdom of Prussia, protested against the offer and hinted at war. Following the protests by France, Leopold had withdrawn his acceptance on 11 July 1870, which was already considered a diplomatic defeat for Prussia. The French were still not satisfied and demanded further commitments, especially a guarantee by the Prussian king that no member of any branch of his Hohenzollern family would ever be a candidate for the Spanish throne.

==Incident==

On 13 July 1870, King Wilhelm I of Prussia, on his morning stroll in the park in Ems, was stopped by Count Vincent Benedetti, the French ambassador to Prussia since 1864. Benedetti had been instructed by his superior, Foreign Minister Agenor, duc de Gramont, to present the French demand that the king should guarantee that he would never again permit the candidacy of a Hohenzollern prince to the Spanish throne. In addition, the Prussian envoy in Paris, Baron von Werther, was asked for King Wilhelm to send a letter to Napoleon III that would amount to a personal apology for the matter. The meeting was informal and took place on the promenade of the Kursaal with the King&#x27;s entourage at a discreet distance. Politely and in a friendly manner, &quot;with the courtesy that never failed him&quot;, the King refused to bind himself to any course of action into the indefinite future. After their exchange, &quot;the two departed coolly.&quot;

Heinrich Abeken, Privy Legation Councillor of the North German Confederation&#x27;s Foreign Office, wrote an account of the event for Otto von Bismarck in Berlin. Wilhelm described Benedetti as &quot;annoyingly persistent&quot;. The King asked Bismarck to release an account of the events.

Bismarck had full liberty to inform the press in a suitable way; it was not his task to publish Abeken&#x27;s original report. Bismarck decided to use some of Abeken&#x27;s wording for his own press release. He removed Wilhelm&#x27;s conciliatory phrases and emphasised the real issue. The French had made certain demands under threat of war, and Wilhelm had refused them. That was a clear statement of the facts.

Certainly, Bismarck&#x27;s text, released on the evening of the same day to the media and foreign embassies, gave the impression both that Benedetti was rather more demanding and that the King was exceedingly abrupt. It was designed to give the French the impression that the King had insulted Benedetti; likewise, the Germans interpreted the modified dispatch as Benedetti insulting the King.

Bismarck had viewed the worsening relations with France with open satisfaction. If war had to come, then better sooner than later. His press release, he assured his friends, &quot;would have the effect of a red rag on the Gallic [French] bull.&quot; The document was then to be presented as the cause of the war.

==Text==
===Abeken&#x27;s message===

His Majesty the King writes to me:

Count Benedetti intercepted me on the promenade to demand of me, finally in a very importunate manner, that I should authorize him to telegraph at once that I bound myself in perpetuity never again to give my consent if the Hohenzollerns renewed their candidature.

I rejected this demand somewhat sternly [ ], as it is neither right nor possible to undertake commitments of this kind &quot;à tout jamais&quot;.

Naturally, I told him that I had not yet received any news and that since he had been earlier informed concerning Paris and Madrid than I was, he must surely see that my government was not involved in the matter.

His Majesty later received a message from the Duke.

As His Majesty had told Count Benedetti that he was expecting news from the Duke, he personally, in view of the above-mentioned importunity, upon the advice of Count Eulenburg and myself, decided not to receive Count Benedetti any more, but merely to have him informed by an adjutant: that His Majesty had now received from the Duke confirmation of the news which Benedetti had already had from Paris and had nothing further to say to the ambassador.

His Majesty suggests to Your Excellency, that Benedetti&#x27;s new demand and its rejection might well be communicated both to our ambassadors and to the Press.
===Bismarck&#x27;s communiqué===

After the news of the renunciation of the Prince von Hohenzollern had been communicated to the Imperial French government by the Royal Spanish government, the French Ambassador in Ems made a further demand on His Majesty the King that he should authorize him to telegraph to Paris that His Majesty the King undertoo for all time never again to give his assent should the Hohenzollerns once more take up their candidature.

His Majesty the King thereupon refused to receive the Ambassador again and had the latter informed by the Adjutant of the day that His Majesty had no further communication to make to the Ambassador.
===French translation===
The French translation by the agency Havas did not translate the German word , which refers to a high-ranking aide de camp, but in French, it describes only a non-commissioned officer (), which implied that the King had deliberately insulted the ambassador by not choosing an officer to carry the message to him. That was the version printed by most newspapers the following day, which happened to be July 14 (Bastille Day), setting the tone, letting the French believe that the king had insulted their ambassador before the latter could tell his story.

==Aftermath==
France&#x27;s mistaken attitude of its own position carried matters far beyond what was necessary, and France mobilized. Further improper translations and misinterpretations of the dispatch in the press made excited crowds in Paris demand war, just as Bismarck had anticipated. The Ems dispatch had also rallied German national feeling. It was no longer Prussia alone; South German particularism was now cast aside.

For the French declaration of war the dispatch and the message to the press was rather irrelevant. Napoléon had already decided to go to war to stabilize his regime and keep its dominant position in Europe. This intention did not depend on Bismarck&#x27;s action. France went to war because it believed that it would win. Contrary to popular belief, Bismarck did not prepare everything long before (he himself had contributed to that myth). As a good politician, he tried to keep several options open; when the opportunity showed up, he published the message to the press with the intention to stir up the emotions.

Benedetti, the messenger for the Duc de Gramont&#x27;s demands for pointless guarantees (the Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen family had withdrawn Prince Leopold&#x27;s candidature on 11 July 1870 with Wilhelm&#x27;s &quot;entire and unreserved approval&quot;), became an unseen bit-player; his own dispatches to Paris no longer mattered. In the legislative chamber, by an overwhelming majority, the votes for war credits were passed. France declared war on 19 July 1870, starting the Franco-Prussian War. Following the French defeat in 1871, the Duc de Gramont attempted to throw the blame for the failures of French diplomacy on Benedetti, who published his version of the events in his defence in &quot;Ma mission en Prusse&quot; (Paris, 1871).

<doc id="239987" wikidata="Q45071" url="?curid=239987" title="Progestogen">
<text>Progestogens, also sometimes written progestins, progestagens or gestagens, are a class of natural or synthetic steroid hormones that bind to and activate the progesterone receptors (PR). Progesterone is the major and most important progestogen in the body. The progestogens are named for their function in maintaining pregnancy (i.e., &quot;progestational&quot;), although they are also present at other phases of the estrous and menstrual cycles.

The progestogens are one of three types of sex hormones, the others being estrogens like estradiol and androgens/anabolic steroids like testosterone. In addition, they are one of the five major classes of steroid hormones, the others being the androgens, estrogens, glucocorticoids, and mineralocorticoids, as well as the neurosteroids. All endogenous progestogens are characterized by their basic 21-carbon skeleton, called a pregnane skeleton (C21). In similar manner, the estrogens possess an estrane skeleton (C18), and androgens, an androstane skeleton (C19).

The terms &quot;progesterone&quot;, &quot;progestogen&quot;, and &quot;progestin&quot; are mistakenly used interchangeably both in the scientific literature and in clinical settings. &quot;Progestins&quot; are &quot;synthetic progestogens&quot; and are used in medicine. Major examples of progestins include the 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivative medroxyprogesterone acetate and the 19-nortestosterone derivative norethisterone. The progestins are structural analogues of progesterone and have progestogenic activity similarly, but differ from progesterone in their pharmacological properties in various ways. 

In addition to their roles as natural hormones, progestogens are used as medications, for instance in menopausal hormone therapy and transgender hormone therapy for transgender women; for information on progestogens as medications, see the progesterone (medication) and progestogen (medication) articles.

==Types and examples==
The most important progestogen in the body is progesterone (P4). Other endogenous progestogens, with varying degrees of progestogenic activity, include 16α-hydroxyprogesterone (16α-OHP), 17α-hydroxyprogesterone (17α-OHP) (very weak), 20α-dihydroprogesterone (20α-DHP), 20β-dihydroprogesterone (20β-DHP), 5α-dihydroprogesterone (5α-DHP), 5β-dihydroprogesterone (5β-DHP) (very weak), 3β-dihydroprogesterone (3β-DHP), 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC), and 5α-dihydrodeoxycorticosterone (5α-DHDOC). They are all metabolites of progesterone, lying downstream of progesterone in terms of biosynthesis.

==Biological function==
The major tissues affected by progestogens include the uterus, vagina, cervix, breasts, testes, and brain. The main biological role of progestogens in the body is in the female reproductive system, and the male reproductive system, with involvement in regulation of the menstrual cycle, maintenance of pregnancy, and preparation of the mammary glands for lactation and breastfeeding following parturition in women; in men progesterone affects spermiogenesis, sperm capacitation, and testosterone synthesis. Progestogens also have effects in other parts of the body. Unlike estrogens, progestogens have little or no role in feminization.

==Biochemistry==

===Biosynthesis===

Progesterone is produced from cholesterol with pregnenolone as a metabolic intermediate. In the first step in the steroidogenic pathway, cholesterol is converted into pregnenolone, which serves as the precursor to the progestogens progesterone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone. These progestogens, along with another steroid, 17α-hydroxypregnenolone, are the precursors of all other endogenous steroids, including the androgens, estrogens, glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and neurosteroids. Thus, many tissues producing steroids, including the adrenal glands, testes, and ovaries, produce progestogens.

In some tissues, the enzymes required for the final product are not all located in a single cell. For example, in ovarian follicles, cholesterol is converted to androstenedione, an androgen, in the theca cells, which is then further converted into estrogen in the granulosa cells. Fetal adrenal glands also produce pregnenolone in some species, which is converted into progesterone and estrogens by the placenta (see below). In the human, the fetal adrenals produce dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) via the pregnenolone pathway.

====Ovarian production====
Progesterone is the major progestogen produced by the corpus luteum of the ovary in all mammalian species. Luteal cells possess the necessary enzymes to convert cholesterol to pregnenolone, which is subsequently converted into progesterone. Progesterone is highest in the diestrus phase of the estrous cycle.

====Placental production====
The role of the placenta in progestogen production varies by species. In the sheep, horse, and human, the placenta takes over the majority of progestogen production, whereas in other species the corpus luteum remains the primary source of progestogens. In the sheep and human, progesterone is the major placental progestogen.

The equine placenta produces a variety of progestogens, primarily 5α-dihydroprogesterone and 5α,20α-tetrahydroprogesterone, beginning on day 60. A complete luteo-placental shift occurs by day 120–150.

==Chemistry==
The endogenous progestogens are naturally occurring pregnane steroids with ketone and/or hydroxyl groups at the C3 and C20 positions.

==Medical use==
Progestogens, including both progesterone and progestins, are used medically in hormonal birth control, hormone therapy, to treat gynecological disorders, to suppress sex hormone levels for various purposes, and for other indications.

<text>A progestogen, also referred to as a progestagen, gestagen, or gestogen, is a type of medication which produces effects similar to those of the natural female sex hormone progesterone in the body. A progestin is a &quot;synthetic&quot; progestogen. Progestogens are used most commonly in hormonal birth control and menopausal hormone therapy. They can also be used in the treatment of gynecological conditions, to support fertility and pregnancy, to lower sex hormone levels for various purposes, and for other indications. Progestogens are used alone or in combination with estrogens. They are available in a wide variety of formulations and for use by many different routes of administration. Examples of progestogens include natural or bioidentical progesterone as well as progestins such as medroxyprogesterone acetate and norethisterone.
Side effects of progestogens include menstrual irregularities, headaches, nausea, breast tenderness, mood changes, acne, increased hair growth, and changes in liver protein production among others. Other side effects of progestogens may include an increased risk of breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and blood clots. At high doses, progestogens can cause low sex hormone levels and associated side effects like sexual dysfunction and an increased risk of bone fractures.
Progestogens are agonists of the progesterone receptors (PRs) and produce progestogenic, or progestational, effects. They have important effects in the female reproductive system (uterus, cervix, and vagina), the breasts, and the brain. In addition, many progestogens also have other hormonal activities, such as androgenic, antiandrogenic, estrogenic, glucocorticoid, or antimineralocorticoid activity. They also have antigonadotropic effects and at high doses can strongly suppress sex hormone production. Progestogens mediate their contraceptive effects both by inhibiting ovulation and by thickening cervical mucus, thereby preventing fertilization. They have functional antiestrogenic effects in certain tissues like the endometrium, and this underlies their use in menopausal hormone therapy.
Progesterone was first introduced for medical use in 1934 and the first progestin, ethisterone, was introduced for medical use in 1939. More potent progestins, such as norethisterone, were developed and started to be used in birth control in the 1950s. Around 60 progestins have been marketed for clinical use in humans or use in veterinary medicine. These progestins can be grouped into different classes and generations. Progestogens are available widely throughout the world and are used in all forms of hormonal birth control and in most menopausal hormone therapy regimens.

==Medical uses==

===Available forms===

Progestogens are available in many different forms for use by many different routes of administration. These include oral tablets and capsules, oil and aqueous solutions and suspensions for intramuscular or subcutaneous injection, and various others (e.g., transdermal patches, vaginal rings, intrauterine devices, subcutaneous implants).

Dozens of different progestogens have been marketed for clinical and/or veterinary use.

===Birth control===
Progestogens are used in a variety of different forms of hormonal birth control for females, including combined estrogen and progestogen forms like combined oral contraceptive pills, combined contraceptive patches, combined contraceptive vaginal rings, and combined injectable contraceptives; and progestogen-only forms like progestogen-only contraceptive pills (&quot;mini-pills&quot;), progestogen-only emergency contraceptive pills (&quot;day-after pills&quot;), progestogen-only contraceptive implants, progestogen-only intrauterine devices, progestogen-only contraceptive vaginal rings, and progestogen-only injectable contraceptives.

Progestogens mediate their contraceptive effects by multiple mechanisms, including prevention of ovulation via their antigonadotropic effects; thickening of cervical mucus, making the cervix largely impenetrable to sperm; preventing capacitation of sperm due to changes in cervical fluid, thereby making sperm unable to penetrate the ovum; and atrophic changes in the endometrium, making the endometrium unsuitable for implantation. They may also decrease tubal motility and ciliary action.

===Hormone therapy===

====Menopause and hypogonadism====
Progestogens are used in combination with estrogens in menopausal hormone therapy in women. They are also used in combination with estrogens in hormone therapy for hypogonadism and delayed puberty in girls and women. They are used mainly to prevent endometrial hyperplasia and increased risk of endometrial cancer from unopposed estrogen therapy.

====Transgender hormone therapy====
Progestogens are used as a component of hormone therapy for transgender women and transgender men. They are used in transgender women in combination with estrogens to help suppress and block testosterone. Progestogens might also have other beneficial effects in transgender women, but these are controversial and unsupported at present. Examples of progestogens used in hormone therapy for transgender women include cyproterone acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and progesterone. Progestogens, such as medroxyprogesterone and lynestrenol, are used in transgender men to help suppress menses. Progestogens have also been used to delay puberty in transgender boys and girls.

====Other uses====
Certain progestogens, including megestrol acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, cyproterone acetate, and chlormadinone acetate, have been used at high doses to reduce hot flashes in men undergoing androgen deprivation therapy, for instance to treat prostate cancer.

===Gynecological disorders===

====Menstrual disorders====
Progestogens are used to treat menstrual disorders such as secondary amenorrhea and dysfunctional uterine bleeding. In a normal menstrual cycle, declining levels of progesterone trigger menstruation. Progestogens such as norethisterone acetate and medroxyprogesterone acetate may be used to artificially induce progesterone-associated breakthrough bleeding.

The progestogen challenge test or progestogen withdrawal test is used to diagnose amenorrhea. Due to the availability of assays to measure estrogen levels, it is now rarely used.

====Uterine disorders====
Progestogens are used in the prevention and treatment of uterine disorders such as endometrial hyperplasia, endometriosis, uterine fibroids, and uterine hypoplasia.

====Breast disorders====
Progestogens are used to treat benign breast disorders. They are associated not only with a reduction in breast pain, but also a decrease in breast cell proliferation, a decrease in breast gland size, and a disappearance of breast nodularity. Progestogens that have been used for such purposes include topical progesterone, dydrogesterone, promegestone, lynestrenol, medroxyprogesterone acetate, dienogest, and medrogestone.

Progestogens are used in the treatment of breast hypoplasia and lactation insufficiency. This is because they induce lobuloalveolar development of the breasts, which is required for lactation and breastfeeding.

===Enlarged prostate===
Progestogens have been used at high doses to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). They act by suppressing gonadal testosterone production and hence circulating testosterone levels. Androgens like testosterone stimulate the growth of the prostate gland.

===Hormone-sensitive cancers===

====Endometrial cancer====
Progestogens were first found to be effective at high doses in the treatment of endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer in 1959. Subsequently, high-dose gestonorone caproate, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and megestrol acetate were approved for the treatment of endometrial cancer.

====Breast cancer====
Progestogens, such as megestrol acetate and medroxyprogesterone acetate, are effective at high doses in the treatment of advanced postmenopausal breast cancer. They have been extensively evaluated as a second-line therapy for this indication. However, they produce various side effects, such as dyspnea, weight gain, vaginal bleeding, nausea, fluid retention, hypertension, thrombophlebitis, and thromboembolic complications. In addition, megestrol acetate has been found to be significantly inferior to aromatase inhibitors in the treatment of breast cancer, and in relation to this, progestogens have been moved down in the sequential therapy of the disease. Megestrol acetate is the only Food and Drug Administration-approved progestogen for breast cancer. The mechanism of action of progestogens in the treatment of breast cancer is unknown, but may be related to their functional antiestrogenic and/or antigonadotropic effects.

====Prostate cancer====
Certain progestogens, particularly those with antiandrogenic properties, have been used at high doses in the treatment of prostate cancer. These include cyproterone acetate, chlormadinone acetate, and megestrol acetate. Other progestogens such as medroxyprogesterone acetate, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, and gestonorone caproate have also been studied, but have inadequate effectiveness. They act by suppressing gonadal testosterone production and hence circulating testosterone levels. Androgens like testosterone stimulate the growth of prostate tumors.

===Fertility and pregnancy===
Progestogens are used in fertility medicine for women. For example, progesterone (or sometimes dydrogesterone or hydroxyprogesterone caproate) is used for luteal support in &quot;in-vitro&quot; fertilization protocols.

Certain progestogens are used to support pregnancy, including progesterone, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, dydrogesterone, and allylestrenol. They are used questionably for treatment of recurrent pregnancy loss and for prevention of preterm birth in pregnant women with a history of at least one spontaneous preterm birth.

===Puberty suppression===
Progestogens have been used to treat precocious puberty in both boys and girls. They have also been used to delay puberty in transgender youth.

===Sexual deviance===
Certain progestogens, such as cyproterone acetate and medroxyprogesterone acetate, are used as a form of chemical castration to treat sexual deviance in men, particularly sex offenders. They are specifically used to treat paraphilias and hypersexuality. They work by suppressing gonadal testosterone production and hence circulating testosterone levels. This results in decreased libido and interference with erectile function and ability to attain orgasm.

===Skin and hair conditions===
Progestogens are used to treat androgen-dependent skin and hair conditions in women. These include oily skin, acne, seborrhea, hirsutism, scalp hair loss, and hidradenitis suppurativa. They act by suppressing testosterone levels and, in the case of antiandrogenic progestogens, by directly blocking the actions of androgens.

===Androgen excess===
Progestogens are used to treat hyperandrogenism, such as due to polycystic ovary syndrome and congenital adrenal hyperplasia, in women. Examples include cyproterone acetate and chlormadinone acetate.

===Appetite stimulation===
Certain progestins can be used at very high doses to increase appetite in conditions like cachexia, anorexia, and wasting syndromes. In general, they are used in combination with certain other steroid medications such as dexamethasone. Their effects take several weeks to become apparent, but are relatively long-lived when compared to those of corticosteroids. Furthermore, they are recognized as being the only medications to increase lean body mass. Megestrol acetate is the lead drug of this class for the management of cachexia, and medroxyprogesterone acetate is also used. The mechanism of action of the appetite-related effects of these two medications is unknown and may not be related to their progestogenic activity. Very high doses of other progestogens, like cyproterone acetate, have minimal or no influence on appetite and weight.

==Contraindications==
Contraindications of progestogens may include breast cancer and a history of venous thromboembolism among others.

==Side effects==
Progestogens have relatively few side effects at typical dosages. Side effects of progestogens may include tiredness, dysphoria, depression, mood changes, menstrual irregularities, hypomenorrhea, edema, vaginal dryness, vaginal atrophy, headaches, nausea, breast tenderness, decreased libido. Progestins with androgenic activity, namely 19-nortestosterone derivatives, can also cause acne, hirsutism, seborrhea, voice deepening, changes in liver protein production (e.g., decreased HDL cholesterol, sex hormone-binding globulin), increased appetite, and weight gain, among others. Other side effects of progestogens may include an increased risk of breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and blood clots, among others. Some of the side effects of progestogens are due not to their progestogenic activity but rather due to off-target activities (e.g., androgenic activity, glucocorticoid activity, antimineralocorticoid activity). At high doses, due to their antigonadotropic effects, progestogens can cause low sex hormone levels and associated side effects like diminished secondary sexual characteristics, sexual dysfunction (e.g., reduced sex drive and erectile dysfunction), reversible infertility, reduced bone mineral density, and an increased risk of bone fractures, both in men and in premenopausal women.

===Mood changes===

====Birth control====
The available evidence on the risk of mood changes and depression with progestogens in hormonal birth control is limited. As of 2019, there is no consistent evidence for adverse effects on mood of hormonal birth control, including progestogen-only birth control and combined birth control, in the general population. Most women taking combined birth control experience no influence or a beneficial effect on mood. Adverse effects on mood appear to be infrequent, occurring only in a small percentage of women. About 5 to 10% of women experience negative mood changes with combined birth control pills, and about 5% of women discontinue birth control pills due to such changes. A study of about 4,000 women found that progestogen-only birth control with depot medroxyprogesterone acetate had an incidence of depression of 1.5% and discontinuation due to depression of 0.5%. Beneficial effects of hormonal birth control such as decreased menstrual pain and bleeding may positively influence mood.

A 2018 systematic review of 26 studies, including 5 randomized controlled trials and 21 observational studies, found that the overall evidence showed no association between progestogen-only birth control and depression. The progestins assessed included depot medroxyprogesterone acetate, levonorgestrel-containing contraceptive implants and intrauterine devices, and progestogen-only birth control pills. Findings of large observational studies are mixed due to prominent confounding factors, but overall show no association of hormonal birth control with depression. Randomized controlled trials typically do not find clinically significant influences of hormonal birth control on mood. Reviews from before 1980 reported a high incidence of adverse mood effects with combined birth control pills. However, doses of estrogens and progestogens in birth control pills before 1980 were considerably higher than those used today, and these doses frequently caused unpleasant side effects that may have unfavorably influenced mood.

Mood with birth control pills may be better with monophasic and continuous formulations than with triphasic and cyclic formulations. Limited and inconsistent evidence supports differences in mood with hormonal birth control using different doses of ethinylestradiol or different routes of administration, such as birth control pills versus contraceptive vaginal rings and contraceptive patches. Combined birth control with less androgenic or antiandrogenic progestins like desogestrel, gestodene, and drospirenone may have a more favorable influence on mood than birth control with more androgenic progestins like levonorgestrel. However, androgen supplementation with hormonal birth control has also been reported to improve mood.

Hormonal birth control that suppresses ovulation is effective in the treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Combined birth control pills containing drospirenone are approved for the treatment of PMDD and may be particularly beneficial due to the antimineralocorticoid activity of drospirenone. Studies on the influence of hormonal birth control on mood in women with existing mood disorders or polycystic ovary syndrome are limited and mixed. Women with underlying mood disorders may be more likely to experience mood changes with hormonal birth control. A 2016 systematic review found based on limited evidence from 6 studies that hormonal birth control, including combined birth control pills, depot medroxyprogesterone acetate, and levonorgestrel-containing intrauterine devices, was not associated with worse outcomes compared to non-use in women with depressive or bipolar disorders. A 2008 Cochrane review found a greater likelihood of postpartum depression in women given norethisterone enanthate as a form of progestogen-only injectable birth control, and recommended caution on the use of progestogen-only birth control in the postpartum period.

Studies suggest a negativity bias in emotion recognition and reactivity with hormonal birth control. Some data suggests blunted reward responses and potential dysregulation of the stress response with hormonal birth control in some women.

====Hormone therapy====
Estrogen therapy appears to have a beneficial influence on mood in depressed and euthymic perimenopausal women. Conversely, research on combined estrogen and progestogen therapy for depressive symptoms in menopausal women is scarce and inconclusive. Some researchers contend that progestogens have an adverse influence on mood and reduce the benefits of estrogens on mood, whereas other researchers maintain that progestogens have no adverse influence on mood. Progesterone differs from progestins in terms of effects in the brain and might have different effects on mood in comparison. The available evidence, although limited, suggests no adverse influence of progesterone on mood when used in menopausal hormone therapy.

===Sexual function===
In most women, sexual desire is unchanged or increased with combined birth control pills. This is despite an increase in sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels and a decrease in total and free testosterone levels. However, findings are conflicting, and more research is needed.

===Blood clots===
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) consists of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). DVT is a blood clot in a deep vein, most commonly in the legs, while PE occurs when a clot breaks free and blocks an artery in the lungs. VTE is a rare but potentially fatal cardiovascular event. Estrogens and progestogens can increase coagulation by modulating synthesis of coagulation factors. As a result, they increase the risk of VTE, especially during pregnancy when estrogen and progesterone levels are very high as well as during the postpartum period. Physiological levels of estrogen and/or progesterone may also influence risk of VTE—with late menopause (≥55 years) being associated with greater risk than early menopause (≤45 years).

====Progestogen monotherapy====
Progestogens when used by themselves at typical clinical dosages, for instance in progestogen-only birth control, do not affect coagulation and are not generally associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). An exception is medroxyprogesterone acetate as a progestogen-only injectable contraceptive, which has been associated with a 2- to 4-fold increase in risk of VTE relative to other progestogens and non-use. The reasons for this are unknown, but the observations might be a statistical artifact of preferential prescription of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate to women at risk for VTE. Alternatively, medroxyprogesterone acetate may be an exception among progestogens in terms of influence on VTE risk, possibly due to its partial glucocorticoid activity. In contrast to depot medroxyprogesterone acetate, no increase in VTE risk has been observed with moderately high doses of the related progestin chlormadinone acetate (10 mg/day for 18–20 days/cycle), though based on limited data.

Very-high-dose progestogen therapy, including with medroxyprogesterone acetate, megestrol acetate, and cyproterone acetate, has been associated with activation of coagulation and a dose-dependent increased risk of VTE. In studies with high-dose cyproterone acetate specifically, the increase in VTE risk has ranged from 3- to 5-fold. The incidence of VTE in studies with very-high-dose progestogen therapy has been found to range from 2 to 8%. However, the relevant patient populations, namely aged individuals with cancer, are already predisposed to VTE, and this greatly amplifies the risk.

====Estrogen plus progestogen therapy====
In contrast to progestogen-only birth control, the addition of progestins to oral estrogen therapy, including in combined birth control pills and menopausal hormone therapy, is associated with a higher risk of VTE than with oral estrogen therapy alone. The risk of VTE is increased by about 2-fold or less with such regimens in menopausal hormone therapy and by 2- to 4-fold with combined birth control pills containing ethinylestradiol, both relative to non-use. In contrast to oral estrogen therapy, parenteral estradiol, such as with transdermal estradiol, is not associated with a higher risk of VTE. This is likely due to its lack of first-pass effect in the liver. Research is mixed on whether addition of progestins to transdermal estradiol is associated with a greater risk of VTE, with some studies finding no increase in risk and others finding higher risk. Unlike the case of transdermal estradiol, VTE risk is not lower with ethinylestradiol-containing contraceptive vaginal rings and contraceptive patches compared to combined birth control pills with ethinylestradiol. This is thought to be due to the resistance of ethinylestradiol to hepatic metabolism.

The type of progestin in combined birth control may modulate the risk of VTE. Studies have found that combined birth control pills containing newer-generation progestins such as desogestrel, gestodene, norgestimate, drospirenone, and cyproterone acetate are associated with a 1.5- to 3-fold higher risk of VTE than birth control pills containing first-generation progestins such as levonorgestrel and norethisterone. However, although this has been apparent in retrospective cohort and nested case–control studies, no greater risk of VTE has been observed in prospective cohort and case–control studies. These kinds of observational studies have certain advantages over the aforementioned types of studies, such as better ability to control for confounding factors like new-user bias. As such, it is unclear whether the higher risk of VTE with newer-generation birth control pills is a real finding or a statistical artifact. Androgenic progestins have been found to antagonize to some degree the effect of estrogens on coagulation. First-generation progestins are more androgenic, while newer-generation progestins are weakly androgenic or antiandrogenic, and this might explain the observed differences in risk of VTE. The type of estrogen also influences VTE risk. Birth control pills containing estradiol valerate are associated with about half the VTE risk of birth control pills with ethinylestradiol.

The type of progestogen in combined menopausal hormone therapy may also modulate VTE risk. Oral estrogens plus dydrogesterone appears to have lower VTE risk relative to inclusion of other progestins. Norpregnane derivatives such as nomegestrol acetate and promegestone have been associated with a significantly greater risk of VTE than pregnane derivatives such as medroxyprogesterone acetate and dydrogesterone and nortestosterone derivatives such as norethisterone and levonorgestrel. However, these findings may just be statistical artifacts. In contrast to progestins, the addition of oral progesterone to either oral or transdermal estrogen therapy is not associated with a higher risk of VTE. However, oral progesterone achieves very low progesterone levels and has relatively weak progestogenic effects, which might be responsible for the absence of increase in VTE risk. Parenteral progesterone, such as vaginal or injectable progesterone, which can achieve luteal-phase levels of progesterone and associated progestogenic effects, has not been characterized in terms of VTE risk.

A 2012 meta-analysis estimated that the absolute risk of VTE is 2 per 10,000 women for non-use, 8 per 10,000 women for ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel-containing birth control pills, and 10 to 15 per 10,000 women for birth control pills containing ethinylestradiol and a newer-generation progestin. For comparison, the absolute risk of VTE is generally estimated as 1 to 5 per 10,000 woman-years for non-use, 5 to 20 per 10,000 woman-years for pregnancy, and 40 to 65 per 10,000 woman-years for the postpartum period. Risk of VTE with estrogen and progestogen therapy is highest at the start of treatment, particularly during the first year, and decreases over time. Older age, higher body weight, lower physical activity, and smoking are all associated with a higher risk of VTE with oral estrogen and progestogen therapy. Women with thrombophilia have a dramatically higher risk of VTE with estrogen and progestogen therapy than women without thrombophilia. Depending on the condition, risk of VTE can be increased as much as 50-fold in such women relative to non-use.

Estrogens induce the production of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) in the liver. As such, SHBG levels indicate hepatic estrogenic exposure and may be a reliable surrogate marker for coagulation and VTE risk with estrogen therapy. Combined birth control pills containing different progestins result in SHBG levels that are increased 1.5- to 2-fold with levonorgestrel, 2.5- to 4-fold with desogestrel and gestodene, 3.5- to 4-fold with drospirenone and dienogest, and 4- to 5-fold with cyproterone acetate. SHBG levels differ depending on the progestin because androgenic progestins oppose the effect of ethinylestradiol on hepatic SHBG production as with its procoagulatory effects. Contraceptive vaginal rings and contraceptive patches likewise have been found to increase SHBG levels by 2.5-fold and 3.5-fold, respectively. Birth control pills containing high doses of ethinylestradiol (&gt;50 μg) can increase SHBG levels by 5- to 10-fold, which is similar to the increase that occurs during pregnancy. Conversely, increases in SHBG levels are much lower with estradiol, especially when it is used parenterally. Estradiol-containing combined birth control pills, like estradiol valerate/dienogest and estradiol/nomegestrol acetate, and high-dose parenteral polyestradiol phosphate therapy have both been found to increase SHBG levels by about 1.5-fold.

Hormone therapy with high-dose ethinylestradiol and cyproterone acetate in transgender women has been associated with a 20- to 45-fold higher risk of VTE relative to non-use. The absolute incidence was about 6%. Conversely, the risk of VTE in transgender women is much lower with oral or transdermal estradiol plus high-dose cyproterone acetate. Ethinylestradiol is thought to have been primarily responsible for the VTE risk, but cyproterone acetate may have contributed as well. Ethinylestradiol is no longer used in transgender hormone therapy, and doses of cyproterone acetate have been reduced.

===Cardiovascular health===
Progestogens may influence the risk of cardiovascular disease in women. In the women&#x27;s Health Initiative (WHI), the risk of coronary heart disease was greater with the combination of estrogen plus a progestin (specifically medroxyprogesterone acetate) than with estrogen alone. However, progestogens have varying activities and may differ in terms of cardiovascular risk. A 2015 Cochrane review provided strong evidence that the treatment of post-menopausal women with hormone therapy for cardiovascular disease had little if any effect and increased the risk of stroke and venous thromboembolic events. It is thought that androgenic progestins like medroxyprogesterone acetate and norethisterone may antagonize the beneficial effects of estrogens on biomarkers of cardiovascular health (e.g., favorable lipid profile changes). However, these findings are mixed and controversial. Differences of progestogens on cardiovascular health and risk have been reviewed and summarized:

:&quot;Unfortunately, there are few long-term clinical studies comparing different progestogens used in [hormone therapy] with respect to cardiovascular outcomes. However, some aspects of potential cardiovascular risk have been examined, namely effects on lipids, vascular function/blood pressure, inflammation, thrombosis, and carbohydrate metabolism. [...] Although progestins have differing effects on aspects of cardiovascular risk, in general, those more similar to progesterone have been associated with a lower impact than the more androgenic progestins on the beneficial effects of concomitant estrogen therapy. However, the limited number of long-term clinical studies makes it difficult to extrapolate the short-term effects on various markers of cardiovascular risk to long-term cardiovascular morbidity.&quot;

Route of administration might also influence the cardiovascular health effects of progestogens, but more research is needed similarly.

===Breast cancer===
Estrogen alone, progestogen alone, and combined estrogen and progestogen therapy are all associated with increased risks of breast cancer when used in menopausal hormone therapy for peri- and postmenopausal women relative to non-use. These risks are higher for combined estrogen and progestogen therapy than with estrogen alone or progestogen alone. In addition to breast cancer risk, estrogen alone and estrogen plus progestogen therapy are associated with higher breast cancer mortality. With 20 years of use, breast cancer incidence is about 1.5-fold higher with estrogen alone and about 2.5-fold higher with estrogen plus progestogen therapy relative to non-use. The increase in breast cancer risk with estrogen and progestogen therapy was shown to be causal with conjugated estrogens plus medroxyprogesterone acetate in the Women&#x27;s Health Initiative randomized controlled trials.

Breast cancer risk with combined estrogen and progestogen therapy may differ depending on the progestogen used. Progestins including chlormadinone acetate, cyproterone acetate, medrogestone, medroxyprogesterone acetate, nomegestrol acetate, norethisterone acetate, promegestone, and tibolone have all been associated with similarly increased risk of breast cancer. Some research has found that oral progesterone and dydrogesterone with short-term use (&lt;5 years) may be associated with lower risk of breast cancer relative to other progestins. In the long-term however (&gt;5 years), oral progesterone and dydrogesterone have been associated with significantly increased breast cancer risk similarly to other progestogens. The lower risk of breast cancer with oral progesterone than with other progestogens may be related to the very low progesterone levels and relatively weak progestogenic effects it produces.

The risk of breast cancer with estrogen and progestogen therapy in peri- and postmenopausal women is dependent on the duration of treatment, with more than 5 years of use being associated with significantly greater risk than less than five years of use. In addition, continuous estrogen and progestogen therapy is associated with a higher risk of breast cancer than cyclic use.

A nationwide observational study found that transfeminine hormone therapy with estrogen plus high-dose cyproterone acetate was associated with a 46-fold increased risk of breast cancer in transgender women relative to the expected incidence for cisgender men. However, the risk of breast cancer was still lower than that in cisgender women. The extent to which the increase in breast cancer risk was related to estrogen versus cyproterone acetate is unknown.



==Overdose==
Progestogens are relatively safe in acute overdose.

==Interactions==
Inhibitors and inducers of cytochrome P450 enzymes and other enzymes such as 5α-reductase may interact with progestogens.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Progestogens act by binding to and activating the progesterone receptors (PRs), including the PR-A, PR-B, and PR-C. Major tissues affected by progestogens include the uterus, cervix, vagina, breasts, and brain. By activating PRs in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, progestogens suppress the secretion of gonadotropins and thereby function as antigonadotropins at sufficiently high doses. Progesterone interacts with membrane progesterone receptors, but interaction of progestins with these receptors is less clear. In addition to their progestogenic activity, many progestogens have off-target activities such as androgenic, antiandrogenic, estrogenic, glucocorticoid, and antimineralocorticoid activity.

Progestogens mediate their contraceptive effects in women both by inhibiting ovulation (via their antigonadotropic effects) and by thickening cervical mucus, thereby preventing the possibility of fertilization of the ovum by sperm. Progestogens have functional antiestrogenic effects in various tissues like the endometrium via activation of the PR, and this underlies their use in menopausal hormone therapy (to prevent unopposed estrogen-induced endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer). The PRs are induced in the breasts by estrogens, and for this reason, it is assumed that progestogens cannot mediate breast changes in the absence of estrogens. The off-target activities of progestogens can contribute both to their beneficial effects and to their adverse effects.



====Antigonadotropic effects====
Progestogens, similarly to the androgens and estrogens through their own respective receptors, inhibit the secretion of the gonadotropins follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) via activation of the PR in the pituitary gland. This effect is a form of negative feedback on the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis (HPG axis) and takes advantage of the mechanism that the body uses to prevent sex hormone levels from becoming too high. Accordingly, progestogens, both endogenous and exogenous (i.e., progestins), have antigonadotropic effects, and progestogens in sufficiently high amounts can markedly suppress the body&#x27;s normal production of progestogens, androgens, and estrogens as well as inhibit fertility (ovulation in women and spermatogenesis in men).

Progestogens have been found to maximally suppress circulating testosterone levels in men by up to 70 to 80% at sufficiently high doses. This is notably less than that achieved by GnRH analogues, which can effectively abolish gonadal production of testosterone and suppress circulating testosterone levels by as much as 95%. It is also less than that achieved by high-dose estrogen therapy, which can suppress testosterone levels into the castrate range similarly to GnRH analogues.

The retroprogesterone derivatives dydrogesterone and trengestone are atypical progestogens and unlike all other clinically used progestogens do not have antigonadotropic effects nor inhibit ovulation even at very high doses. In fact, trengestone may have progonadotropic effects, and is actually able to &quot;induce&quot; ovulation, with about a 50% success rate on average. These progestins also show other atypical properties relative to other progestogens, such as a lack of a hyperthermic effect.

====Androgenic activity====
Some progestins have androgenic activity and can produce androgenic side effects such as increased sebum production (oilier skin), acne, and hirsutism (excessive facial/body hair growth), as well as changes in liver protein production. Only certain progestins are androgenic however, these being the testosterone derivatives and, to a lesser extent, the 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives medroxyprogesterone acetate and megestrol acetate. No other progestins have such activity (though some, conversely, possess antiandrogenic activity). Moreover, the androgenic activity of progestins within the testosterone derivatives also varies, and while some may have high or moderate androgenic activity, others have only low or no such activity.

The androgenic activity of androgenic progestins is mediated by two mechanisms: 1) direct binding to and activation of the androgen receptor; and 2) displacement of testosterone from sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), thereby increasing free (and thus bioactive) testosterone levels. The androgenic activity of many androgenic progestins is offset by combination with ethinylestradiol, which robustly increases SHBG levels, and most oral contraceptives in fact markedly reduce free testosterone levels and can treat or improve acne and hirsutism. An exception is progestin-only contraceptives, which do not also contain an estrogen.

The relative androgenic activity of testosterone-derivative progestins and other progestins that have androgenic activity can be roughly ranked as follows:

* Very high: danazol, ethisterone, gestrinone, normethandrone, norvinisterone
* High: levonorgestrel, norgestrel, norgestrienone, tibolone
* Moderate: norethisterone and its prodrugs (norethisterone acetate, norethisterone enanthate, etynodiol diacetate, lynestrenol, quingestanol acetate)
* Low: desogestrel, etonogestrel, gestodene, norgestimate
* Very low or negligible: allylestrenol, dimethisterone, medroxyprogesterone acetate, megestrol acetate, norelgestromin, noretynodrel, norgesterone
* Antiandrogenic: dienogest, oxendolone

The clinical androgenic and anabolic activity of the androgenic progestins listed above is still far lower than that of conventional androgens and anabolic steroids like testosterone and nandrolone esters. As such, they are only generally associated with such effects in women and often only at high doses. In men, due to their concomitant progestogenic activity and by extension antigonadotropic effects, these progestins can have potent functional antiandrogenic effects via suppression of testosterone production and levels.

====Antiandrogenic activity====
Some progestogens have antiandrogenic activity in addition to their progestogenic activity. These progestogens, with varying degrees of potency as antiandrogens, include chlormadinone acetate, cyproterone acetate, dienogest, drospirenone, medrogestone, megestrol acetate, nomegestrol acetate, osaterone acetate (veterinary), and oxendolone. The relative antiandrogenic activity in animals of some of these progestogens has been ranked as follows: cyproterone acetate (100%) &gt; nomegestrol acetate (90%) &gt; dienogest (30–40%) ≥ chlormadinone acetate (30%) = drospirenone (30%). Antiandrogenic activity in certain progestogens may help to improve symptoms of acne, seborrhea, hirsutism, and other androgen-dependent conditions in women.

====Estrogenic activity====
A few progestins have weak estrogenic activity. These include the 19-nortestosterone derivatives norethisterone, noretynodrel, and tibolone, as well as the norethisterone prodrugs norethisterone acetate, norethisterone enanthate, lynestrenol, and etynodiol diacetate. The estrogenic activity of norethisterone and its prodrugs are due to metabolism into ethinylestradiol. High doses of norethisterone and noretynodrel have been associated with estrogenic side effects such as breast enlargement in women and gynecomastia in men, but also with alleviation of menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women. In contrast, non-estrogenic progestins were not found to be associated with such effects.

====Glucocorticoid activity====
Some progestogens, mainly certain 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives, have weak glucocorticoid activity. This can result, at sufficiently high doses, in side effects such as symptoms of Cushing&#x27;s syndrome, steroid diabetes, adrenal suppression and insufficiency, and neuropsychiatric symptoms like depression, anxiety, irritability, and cognitive impairment. Progestogens with the potential for clinically relevant glucocorticoid effects include the 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives chlormadinone acetate, cyproterone acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, megestrol acetate, promegestone, and segesterone acetate and the testosterone derivatives desogestrel, etonogestrel, and gestodene. Conversely, hydroxyprogesterone caproate possesses no such activity, while progesterone itself has very weak glucocorticoid activity.

====Antimineralocorticoid activity====
Certain progestogens, including progesterone, drospirenone, and gestodene, as well as to a lesser extent dydrogesterone and trimegestone, have varying degrees of antimineralocorticoid activity. Other progestins might also have significant antimineralocorticoid activity. Progesterone itself has potent antimineralocorticoid activity. No clinically used progestogens are known to have mineralocorticoid activity.

Progestins with potent antimineralocorticoid activity like drospirenone may have properties more similar to those of natural progesterone, such as counteraction of cyclical estrogen-induced sodium and fluid retention, edema, and associated weight gain; lowered blood pressure; and possibly improved cardiovascular health.

====Neurosteroid activity====
Progesterone has neurosteroid activity via metabolism into allopregnanolone and pregnanolone, potent positive allosteric modulators of the GABAA receptor. As a result, it has associated effects such as sedation, somnolence, and cognitive impairment. No progestin is known to have similar such neurosteroid activity or effects. However, promegestone has been found to act as a non-competitive antagonist of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor similarly to progesterone.

====Other activities====
Certain progestins have been found to stimulate the proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells &quot;in vitro&quot;, an action that is independent of the classical PRs and is instead mediated via the progesterone receptor membrane component-1 (PGRMC1). Norethisterone, desogestrel, levonorgestrel, and drospirenone strongly stimulate proliferation and medroxyprogesterone acetate, dienogest, and dydrogesterone weakly stimulate proliferation, whereas progesterone, nomegestrol acetate, and chlormadinone acetate act neutrally in the assay and do not stimulate proliferation. It is unclear whether these findings may explain the different risks of breast cancer observed with progesterone, dydrogesterone, and other progestins such as medroxyprogesterone acetate and norethisterone in clinical studies.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Oral progesterone has very low bioavailability and potency. Micronization and dissolution in oil-filled capsules, a formulation known as oral micronized progesterone (OMP), increases the bioavailability of progesterone by several-fold. However, the bioavailability of oral micronized progesterone nonetheless remains very low at less than 2.4%. Progesterone also has a very short elimination half-life in the circulation of no more than 1.5 hours. Due to the poor oral activity of oral micronized progesterone, it has relatively weak progestogenic effects. Administration of progesterone in oil solution by intramuscular injection has a duration of about 2 or 3 days, necessitating frequent injections. Transdermal administration of progesterone in the form of creams or gels achieves only very low levels of progesterone and weak progestogenic effects.

Due to the poor oral activity of progesterone and its short duration with intramuscular injection, progestins were developed in its place both for oral use and for parenteral administration. Orally active progestins have high oral bioavailability in comparison to oral micronized progesterone. Their bioavailability is generally in the range of 60 to 100%. Their elimination half-lives are also much longer than that of progesterone, in the range of 8 to 80 hours. Due mainly to their pharmacokinetic improvements, progestins have oral potency that is up to several orders of magnitude greater than that of oral micronized progesterone. For example, the oral potency of medroxyprogesterone acetate is at least 30-fold that of oral micronized progesterone, while the oral potency of gestodene is at least 10,000-fold that of oral micronized progesterone. Parenterally administered progestins, such as hydroxyprogesterone caproate in oil solution, norethisterone enanthate in oil solution, and medroxyprogesterone acetate in microcrystalline aqueous suspension, have durations in the range of weeks to months.

==Chemistry==
All currently available progestogens are steroidal in terms of chemical structure. Progestogens include the naturally occurring progesterone and the synthetic progestogens (otherwise known as progestins). Progestins can be broadly grouped into two structural classes—chemical derivatives of progesterone and chemical derivatives of testosterone. Progesterone derivatives can be classified into subgroups including pregnanes, retropregnanes, norpregnanes, and spirolactones. Examples of progestins of each of these subgroups include medroxyprogesterone acetate, dydrogesterone, nomegestrol acetate, and drospirenone, respectively. Testosterone derivatives can be classified into subgroups including androstanes, estranes (19-norandrostanes), and gonanes (18-methylestranes). Examples of progestins of each of these subgroups include ethisterone, norethisterone, and levonorgestrel, respectively. Many progestins have ester and/or ether substitutions (see progestogen ester) which result in greater lipophilicity and in some cases cause the progestins in question to act as prodrugs in the body.

==History==
The recognition of progesterone&#x27;s ability to suppress ovulation during pregnancy spawned a search for a similar hormone that could bypass the problems associated with administering progesterone (e.g. low bioavailability when administered orally and local irritation and pain when continually administered parenterally) and, at the same time, serve the purpose of controlling ovulation. The many synthetic hormones that resulted are known as progestins.

The first orally active progestin, ethisterone (pregneninolone, 17α-ethynyltestosterone), the C17α ethynyl analogue of testosterone, was synthesized in 1938 from dehydroandrosterone by ethynylation, either before or after oxidation of the C3 hydroxyl group, followed by rearrangement of the C5(6) double bond to the C4(5) position. The synthesis was designed by chemists Hans Herloff Inhoffen, Willy Logemann, Walter Hohlweg and Arthur Serini at Schering AG in Berlin and was marketed in Germany in 1939 as &quot;Proluton C&quot; and by Schering in the U.S. in 1945 as &quot;Pranone&quot;.

A more potent orally active progestin, norethisterone (norethindrone, 19-nor-17α-ethynyltestosterone), the C19 nor analogue of ethisterone, synthesized in 1951 by Carl Djerassi, Luis Miramontes, and George Rosenkranz at Syntex in Mexico City, was marketed by Parke-Davis in the U.S. in 1957 as &quot;Norlutin&quot;, and was used as the progestin in some of the first oral contraceptives (&quot;Ortho-Novum&quot;, &quot;Norinyl&quot;, etc.) in the early 1960s.

Noretynodrel, an isomer of norethisterone, was synthesized in 1952 by Frank B. Colton at Searle in Skokie, Illinois and used as the progestin in &quot;Enovid&quot;, marketed in the U.S. in 1957 and approved as the first oral contraceptive in 1960.

==Society and culture==

===Generations===
Progestins used in birth control are sometimes grouped, somewhat arbitrarily and inconsistently, into &quot;generations&quot;. One categorization of these generations is as follows:

* First generation: Approved for marketing before 1973. Examples: noretynodrel, norethisterone (norethindrone), lynestrenol, levonorgestrel.
* Second generation: Approved for marketing between 1973 and 1989. Examples: desogestrel, nomegestrol acetate, norgestimate.
* Third generation: Approved for marketing between 1990 and 2000. Examples: dienogest, etonogestrel.
* Fourth generation: Approved for marketing after 2000. Examples: drospirenone, norelgestromin, segesterone acetate.

Alternatively, estranes such as noretynodrel and norethisterone are classified as first-generation while gonanes such as norgestrel and levonorgestrel are classified as second-generation, with less androgenic gonanes such as desogestrel, norgestimate, and gestodene classified as third-generation and newer progestins like drospirenone classified as fourth-generation. Yet another classification system considers there to be only first- and second-generation progestins.

Classification of progestins by generation has been criticized and it has been argued that the classification scheme should be abandoned.

===Availability===
Progestogens are available widely throughout the world in many different forms. They are present in all birth control pills.

===Etymology===
&quot;Progestogens&quot;, also termed &quot;progestagens&quot;, &quot;progestogens&quot;, or &quot;gestagens&quot;, are compounds which act as agonists of the progesterone receptors. Progestogens include &quot;progesterone&quot;—which is the main natural and endogenous progestogen—and &quot;progestins&quot;, which are synthetic progestogens. Progestins include the 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivative medroxyprogesterone acetate and the 19-nortestosterone derivative norethisterone, among many other synthetic progestogens. As progesterone is a single compound and has no plural form, the term &quot;progesterones&quot; does not exist and is grammatically incorrect. The terms describing progestogens are often confused. However, progestogens have differing activities and effects and it is inappropriate to interchange them.

==Research==
A variety of progestins have been studied for use as potential male hormonal contraceptives in combination with androgens in men. These include the pregnanes medroxyprogesterone acetate, megestrol acetate, and cyproterone acetate, the norpregnane segesterone acetate, and the estranes norethisterone acetate, norethisterone enanthate, levonorgestrel, levonorgestrel butanoate, desogestrel, and etonogestrel. The androgens that have been used in combination with these progestins include testosterone, testosterone esters, androstanolone (dihydrotestosterone), and nandrolone esters. Dual androgens and progestogens such as trestolone and dimethandrolone undecanoate have also been developed and studied as male contraceptives. Doses of progestins used in male hormonal contraception have been noted to be in the range of 5 to 12times the doses used in female hormonal contraception.

<text>Rapid application development (RAD), also called rapid application building (RAB), is both a general term for adaptive software development approaches, and the name for James Martin&#x27;s method of rapid development. In general, RAD approaches to software development put less emphasis on planning and more emphasis on an adaptive process. Prototypes are often used in addition to or sometimes even instead of design specifications.

RAD is especially well suited for (although not limited to) developing software that is driven by user interface requirements. Graphical user interface builders are often called rapid application development tools. Other approaches to rapid development include the adaptive, agile, spiral, and unified models.

== History ==
Rapid application development was a response to plan-driven waterfall processes, developed in the 1970s and 1980s, such as the Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method (SSADM). One of the problems with these methods is that they were based on a traditional engineering model used to design and build things like bridges and buildings. Software is an inherently different kind of artifact. Software can radically change the entire process used to solve a problem. As a result, knowledge gained from the development process itself can feed back to the requirements and design of the solution. Plan-driven approaches attempt to rigidly define the requirements, the solution, and the plan to implement it, and have a process that discourages changes. RAD approaches, on the other hand, recognize that software development is a knowledge intensive process and provide flexible processes that help take advantage of knowledge gained during the project to improve or adapt the solution.

The first such RAD alternative was developed by Barry Boehm and was known as the spiral model. Boehm and other subsequent RAD approaches emphasized developing prototypes as well as or instead of rigorous design specifications. Prototypes had several advantages over traditional specifications:

* Risk reduction. A prototype could test some of the most difficult potential parts of the system early on in the life-cycle. This can provide valuable information as to the feasibility of a design and can prevent the team from pursuing solutions that turn out to be too complex or time-consuming to implement. This benefit of finding problems earlier in the life-cycle rather than later was a key benefit of the RAD approach. The earlier a problem can be found the cheaper it is to address. 
* Users are better at using and reacting than at creating specifications. In the waterfall model it was common for a user to sign off on a set of requirements but then when presented with an implemented system to suddenly realize that a given design lacked some critical features or was too complex. In general most users give much more useful feedback when they can experience a prototype of the running system rather than abstractly define what that system should be. 
* Prototypes can be usable and can evolve into the completed product. One approach used in some RAD methods was to build the system as a series of prototypes that evolve from minimal functionality to moderately useful to the final completed system. The advantage of this besides the two advantages above was that the users could get useful business functionality much earlier in the process.

Starting with the ideas of Barry Boehm and others, James Martin developed the rapid application development approach during the 1980s at IBM and finally formalized it by publishing a book in 1991, &quot;Rapid Application Development&quot;. This has resulted in some confusion over the term RAD even among IT professionals. It is important to distinguish between RAD as a general alternative to the waterfall model and RAD as the specific method created by Martin. The Martin method was tailored toward knowledge intensive and UI intensive business systems.

These ideas were further developed and improved upon by RAD pioneers like James Kerr and Richard Hunter, who together wrote the seminal book on the subject, Inside RAD, which followed the journey of a RAD project manager as he drove and refined the RAD Methodology in real-time on an actual RAD project. These practitioners, and those like them, helped RAD gain popularity as an alternative to traditional systems project life cycle approaches.

The RAD approach also matured during the period of peak interest in business re-engineering. The idea of business process re-engineering was to radically rethink core business processes such as sales and customer support with the new capabilities of Information Technology in mind. RAD was often an essential part of larger business re engineering programs. The rapid prototyping approach of RAD was a key tool to help users and analysts &quot;think out of the box&quot; about innovative ways that technology might radically reinvent a core business process.

Much of James Martin&#x27;s comfort with RAD stemmed from Dupont&#x27;s Information Engineering division and its leader Scott Schultz and their respective relationships with John Underwood who headed up a bespoke RAD development company that pioneered many successful RAD projects in Australia and Hong Kong.

Successful projects that included ANZ Bank, Lend Lease, BHP, Coca-Cola Amatil, Alcan, Hong Kong Jockey Club and numerous others.

Success that led to both Scott Shultz and James Martin both spending time in Australia with John Underwood to understand the methods and details of why Australia was disproportionately successful in implementing significant mission critical RAD projects.

==James Martin approach==

The James Martin approach to RAD divides the process into four distinct phases: 
# Requirements planning phase – combines elements of the system planning and systems analysis phases of the systems development life cycle (SDLC). Users, managers, and IT staff members discuss and agree on business needs, project scope, constraints, and system requirements. It ends when the team agrees on the key issues and obtains management authorization to continue. 
# User design phase – during this phase, users interact with systems analysts and develop models and prototypes that represent all system processes, inputs, and outputs. The RAD groups or subgroups typically use a combination of joint application design (JAD) techniques and CASE tools to translate user needs into working models. &quot;User design&quot; is a continuous interactive process that allows users to understand, modify, and eventually approve a working model of the system that meets their needs. 
# Construction phase – focuses on program and application development task similar to the SDLC. In RAD, however, users continue to participate and can still suggest changes or improvements as actual screens or reports are developed. Its tasks are programming and application development, coding, unit-integration and system testing. 
# Cutover phase – resembles the final tasks in the SDLC implementation phase, including data conversion, testing, changeover to the new system, and user training. Compared with traditional methods, the entire process is compressed. As a result, the new system is built, delivered, and placed in operation much sooner.

== Advantages ==
In modern Information Technology environments, many systems are now built using some degree of Rapid Application Development (not necessarily the James Martin approach). In addition to Martin&#x27;s method, agile methods and the Rational Unified Process are often used for RAD development.

The purported advantages of RAD include:
* Better quality. By having users interact with evolving prototypes the business functionality from a RAD project can often be much higher than that achieved via a waterfall model. The software can be more usable and has a better chance to focus on business problems that are critical to end users rather than technical problems of interest to developers. However, this excludes other categories of what are usually known as Non-functional requirements (AKA constraints or quality attributes) including security and portability.
* Risk control. Although much of the literature on RAD focuses on speed and user involvement a critical feature of RAD done correctly is risk mitigation. It&#x27;s worth remembering that Boehm initially characterized the spiral model as a risk based approach. A RAD approach can focus in early on the key risk factors and adjust to them based on empirical evidence collected in the early part of the process. E.g., the complexity of prototyping some of the most complex parts of the system. 
* More projects completed on time and within budget. By focusing on the development of incremental units the chances for catastrophic failures that have dogged large waterfall projects is reduced. In the Waterfall model it was common to come to a realization after six months or more of analysis and development that required a radical rethinking of the entire system. With RAD this kind of information can be discovered and acted upon earlier in the process.

== Disadvantages ==
The purported disadvantages of RAD include:
* The risk of a new approach. For most IT shops RAD was a new approach that required experienced professionals to rethink the way they worked. Humans are virtually always averse to change and any project undertaken with new tools or methods will be more likely to fail the first time simply due to the requirement for the team to learn. 
*Lack of emphasis on Non-functional requirements, which are often not visible to the end user in normal operation. 
* Requires time of scarce resources. One thing virtually all approaches to RAD have in common is that there is much more interaction throughout the entire life-cycle between users and developers. In the waterfall model, users would define requirements and then mostly go away as developers created the system. In RAD users are involved from the beginning and through virtually the entire project. This requires that the business is willing to invest the time of application domain experts. The paradox is that the better the expert, the more they are familiar with their domain, the more they are required to actually run the business and it may be difficult to convince their supervisors to invest their time. Without such commitments RAD projects will not succeed.
* Less control. One of the advantages of RAD is that it provides a flexible adaptable process. The ideal is to be able to adapt quickly to both problems and opportunities. There is an inevitable trade-off between flexibility and control, more of one means less of the other. If a project (e.g. life-critical software) values control more than agility RAD is not appropriate. 
* Poor design. The focus on prototypes can be taken too far in some cases resulting in a &quot;hack and test&quot; methodology where developers are constantly making minor changes to individual components and ignoring system architecture issues that could result in a better overall design. This can especially be an issue for methodologies such as Martin&#x27;s that focus so heavily on the user interface of the system.
* Lack of scalability. RAD typically focuses on small to medium-sized project teams. The other issues cited above (less design and control) present special challenges when using a RAD approach for very large scale systems.

<text>Grace Chisholm Young (née Chisholm, 15 March 1868 – 29 March 1944) was an English mathematician. She was educated at Girton College, Cambridge, England and continued her studies at Göttingen University in Germany, where in 1895 she received a doctorate. 
Her early writings were published under the name of her husband, William Henry Young, and they collaborated on mathematical work throughout their lives. For her work on calculus (1914–16), she was awarded the Gamble Prize for Mathematics by Girton College.

==Early life==
She was the youngest of three surviving children. Her father was a senior civil servant, with the title Warden of the Standards in charge of the Weights and Measures Department. The two girls were taught at home by their mother, father and a governess which was the custom for upper-class family during that time. Her family encouraged her to become involved in social work, helping the poor in London. She had aspirations of studying medicine, but her family would not allow this. However, Chisholm wanted to continue her studies. She passed the senior examination for entrance into Cambridge University at the age of 17.

==Education==
Chisholm entered Girton College in 1889 aged 22, four years after she passed the senior entrance examination having been awarded the Sir Francis Goldsmid Scholarship by the college. At this time the college was only associated with the University of Cambridge with men and women graded on separate but related lists. Although she wanted to study medicine, her mother would not permit this, so, supported by her father, she decided to study mathematics. At the end of her first year, when the Mays list came out, she was top of the Second class immediately below Isabel Maddison. In 1893, Grace passed her final examinations with the equivalent of a first-class degree, ranked between 23 and 24 relative to 112 men.

She also took (unofficially, on a challenge, with Isabel Maddison) the exam for the Final Honours School in mathematics at the University of Oxford in 1892 in which she out-performed all the Oxford students. As a result, she became the first person to obtain a First class degree at both Oxford and Cambridge Universities in any subject (although they were not awarded formally).

Chisholm remained at Cambridge for an additional year to complete Part II of the Mathematical Tripos, in the hope of being able to follow an academic career.

She wanted to continue her studies and since women were not yet admitted to graduate schools in England she went to the University of Göttingen in Germany to study with Felix Klein. This was one of the major mathematical centres in the world. She had fortunately already learnt the German language. The decision to admit her had to be approved by the Berlin Ministry of Culture and was part of an experiment in admitting women to university studies. In 1895, at the age of 27, Chisholm was awarded a doctorate in mathematics. Again government approval had to be obtained to allow her to take the examination, which consisted of probing questions by several professors on sections such as geometry, differential equations, physics, astronomy, and the area of her dissertation, all in German. Along with her test she was required to take courses showing broader knowledge as well as prepare a thesis which was entitled &quot;Algebraisch-gruppentheoretische Untersuchungen zur sphärischen Trigonometrie&quot; (&quot;Algebraic Groups of Spherical Trigonometry&quot;).

==Research==
After returning to England in 1896 to marry, she resumed research she had initiated at Gӧttingen into an equation to determine the orbit of a comet. Her husband continued his work coaching in mathematics. However, in 1897 they both returned to Gӧttingen, encouraged by Felix Klein. Both attended advanced lectures and while she continued her mathematical research her husband started to work creatively for the first time. They visited Turin in Italy to study modern geometry and under Klein&#x27;s guidance they began to work in the new area of set theory. From about 1901, the Youngs began to publish papers together. These concerned the theory of functions of a real variable and were heavily influenced by new ideas with which she had come into contact with in Gӧttingen. In 1908 they moved to Geneva in Switzerland where she continued to be based while her husband held a series of academic posts in India and the UK. 
Although most of their work was published jointly it is believed that Grace did a large amount of the actual writing, and she also produced some independent work which, according to expert opinion, was deeper and more important than her husband&#x27;s. In total, they published about 214 papers together, along with four books. She began to publish in her own name in 1914, and was awarded the Gamble Prize for Mathematics by Girton College for an essay &quot;On infinite derivates&quot; in 1915. This work was stimulated by developments in microscopy that allowed real molecular motion to be viewed. Her work between 1914 and 1916 on relationships between derivatives of an arbitrary function contributed to the Denjoy-Young-Saks theorem.

They also wrote an elementary geometry book (&quot;The First Book of Geometry&quot;, 1905) which was translated into 4 languages. In 1906 the Youngs published &quot;The Theory of Sets of Points&quot;, the first textbook on set theory.

==Personal life==
Chisholm married William Henry Young in 1896, the year after she received her PhD from Göttingen. He had been her tutor for one term at Cambridge and they had become friends after he was one of the people that she sent a copy of her doctoral thesis. He suggested collaboration in a publication about astronomy but they did not pursue this. They had six children within nine years.

In addition to her career as a pioneering woman in what was then a discipline with significant barriers to entry, she completed all the requirements for a medical degree except the internship. She also learned six languages and taught each of her children a musical instrument. In addition, she published two books for children (&quot;Bimbo: A Little Real Story for Jill and Molly&quot; (1905) and &quot;Bimbo and the Frogs: Another Real Story&quot; (1907)). The former was aimed to explain where babies came from to children while the latter was about cells. The Young&#x27;s elementary geometry book (&quot;The First Book of Geometry&quot;, 1905) was inspired by the education of their son. In 1929 she started a historical novel &quot;The Crown of England&quot; set in the sixteenth century. She worked on this for five years but it was never published.

With the approach of World War II, she left Switzerland in 1940 to take two of her grandchildren to England. She planned to return immediately, but because of the fall of France, she could not. This left William alone, and he died two years later in 1942. Two years after that, Grace Young died of a heart attack.

Of their six children, three continued on to study mathematics (including Laurence Chisholm Young and Cecilia Rosalind Tanner), one daughter (Janet) became a physician, and one son (Patrick) became a chemist and pursued a career in finance and business. Their eldest son (Frank) was killed in World War I, when his plane was shot down in 1917, and his death had a profound effect on his parents, reducing their mathematical creativity. One of Grace&#x27;s fourteen grandchildren, Sylvia Wiegand (daughter of Laurence), is a mathematician at the University of Nebraska and is a past president of the Association for Women in Mathematics.

==Legacy==
In 1996 Sylvia Wiegand and her husband Roger established a fellowship for graduate student research at the University of Nebraska in honor of Grace Chisholm Young and William Henry Young, called the Grace Chisholm Young and William Henry Young Award. Sylvia is one of Grace&#x27;s fourteen grandchildren.

<text>The Battle of Halidon Hill took place on 19 July 1333 when a Scottish army under Sir Archibald Douglas attacked an English army commanded by King Edward III of England () and was heavily defeated. The year before, Edward Balliol had seized the Scottish Crown from five-year-old David II (), surreptitiously supported by Edward III. This marked the start of the Second War of Scottish Independence. Balliol was shortly expelled from Scotland by a popular uprising, which Edward III used as a &quot;casus belli&quot;, invading Scotland in 1333. The immediate target was the strategically-important border town of Berwick-upon-Tweed, which the English besieged in March.

A large Scottish army advanced to relieve the town. They attempted and failed to draw the English away from Berwick. By mid-July, knowing Berwick was on the verge of surrender and aware they were much stronger than the English, the Scots attacked. They unsuccessfully manoeuvred for position and then launched an assault on the English, who had taken up a favourable defensive position. English longbowmen caused heavy Scottish casualties during their approach, and when the Scots came into contact with the English infantry, the fight was short. The Scottish formations collapsed and the Scots fled in disorder. The English men-at-arms mounted and pursued the Scots for , causing further heavy casualties. The Scottish commander and many of the Scots&#x27; senior nobility were killed during the battle.

Berwick surrendered on terms the next day. Balliol was reinstalled as king of Scotland after ceding much of his territory to Edward III and agreeing to do homage for the balance. Balliol&#x27;s opponents would not admit defeat and he was deposed again in 1334, restored in 1335 and deposed once again in 1336. In 1337 the Hundred Years&#x27; War broke out between France and England which allowed David II to consolidate his position in Scotland. In 1346 the Scots were decisively beaten at the Battle of Neville&#x27;s Cross with heavy loss and David was captured. It was eleven years before terms were agreed for David&#x27;s release. They included an Anglo-Scottish truce, which lasted for four decades and marked the end of the Second War of Scottish Independence.

== Background ==

The First War of Scottish Independence between England and Scotland began in March 1296, when Edward I of England () stormed and sacked the Scottish border town of Berwick as a prelude to his invasion of Scotland. After the 30 years of warfare that followed, the newly crowned 14-year-old King Edward III () was nearly captured in the English disaster at Stanhope Park. This brought his regents, Isabella of France and Roger Mortimer, to the negotiating table. They agreed to the Treaty of Northampton with Robert Bruce () in 1328 but this treaty was widely resented in England and commonly known as , &quot;the shameful peace&quot;. Some Scottish nobles refused to swear fealty to Bruce and were disinherited; they left Scotland to join forces with Edward Balliol, son of King John I of Scotland (), whom Edward I had deposed in 1296.

Robert Bruce died in 1329; his heir was 5-year-old David II (). In 1331, under the leadership of Edward Balliol and Henry Beaumont, Earl of Buchan, the disinherited Scottish nobles gathered in Yorkshire and plotted an invasion of Scotland. Edward III was aware of the scheme and officially forbade it. The reality was different, as Edward was happy to cause trouble for his northern neighbour. He insisted Balliol not invade Scotland overland from England but ignored his forces sailing for Scotland from Yorkshire ports on 31 July 1332. The Scots were aware of the situation and were waiting for Balliol. David II&#x27;s regent was an experienced old soldier, Thomas Randolph, Earl of Moray. He had prepared for Balliol and Beaumont, but died ten days before they sailed.

Five days after landing in Fife, Balliol&#x27;s predominantly English force of some 2,000 men met the Scottish army of 15,000–40,000 men and crushed them at the Battle of Dupplin Moor, south of the Scottish capital, Perth. Thousands of Scots died, including much of the nobility of the realm. Balliol was crowned king of Scotland at Sconethe traditional place of coronation for Scottish monarchson 24 September 1332. Almost immediately, Balliol granted Edward Scottish estates to a value of £2,000 (£ in 2025 terms), which included &quot;the town, castle and county of Berwick&quot;. Balliol&#x27;s support within Scotland was limited and he was subject to constant military challenge; for example on 7 October David&#x27;s supporters recaptured Perth and destroyed its walls. On 16 December, less than three months after his coronation, Balliol was ambushed by supporters of David II at the Battle of Annan. He fled naked on horseback to England where he appealed to Edward for assistance.

Edward dropped all pretence of neutrality, recognised Balliol as king of Scotland and made ready for war. The English parliament met at York and debated the situation for five days without conclusion. Edward promised to discuss the matter with both Pope John XXII and King Philip VI of France (). Possibly to prevent the Scots from taking the initiative, England began openly preparing for war, while announcing it was Scotland which was preparing to invade England.

== Prelude ==

Edward&#x27;s chosen target was Berwick: a Scottish town on the Anglo-Scottish border, astride the main invasion and trade route in either direction. According to a contemporary chronicle, Berwick was &quot;so populous and of such trade that it might justly be called another Alexandria, whose riches were the sea and the waters its walls&quot;. It was the most successful trading town in Scotland, and the duty on wool which passed through it was the Scottish Crown&#x27;s largest single source of income. In the Middle Ages, it was the gateway from Scotland to the English eastern march. Edward hoped the possibility of losing it would draw the Scots into a set-piece battle, which he anticipated winning. During centuries of war between the two nations battles had been rare, as the Scots preferred guerrilla tactics and border raiding into England. Berwick was one of the few targets which might bring the Scots to battle as, in the words of the historian Clifford Rogers, &quot;abandoning it was almost unthinkable&quot;.
Weapons and supplies were gathered as the Scots made arrangements for the defence of Berwick. The town walls stretched for and were up to thick and high. They were protected by towers, each up to tall. Berwick Castle was to the west of the town, separated by a broad moat, making the town and castle independent strongholds. Berwick was well-defended, well-stocked with provisions and materiel, and expected to be able to withstand a long siege.

=== Berwick under siege ===
Balliol, in command of the disinherited Scottish lords and some English magnates, crossed the border on 10 March 1333. He marched through Roxburghshire, burning and pillaging as he went. He reached Berwick in late March and cut it off by land. Edward&#x27;s navy had already isolated it by sea. Balliol and the nobles accompanying him are said to have sworn not to withdraw until Berwick had fallen.

Edward arrived at Berwick with the main English army on 9May, after leaving Queen Philippa at Bamburgh Castle, south of Berwick. Balliol had been at Berwick for six weeks and had placed the town under close siege. Trenches had been dug, four underground pipes supplying water to the town were cut and all communication with the hinterland prevented. A scorched-earth policy was applied to the surrounding area to deny supplies for the town if an opportunity to break the siege occurred. This pillaging of the countryside also added to the English army&#x27;s supplies. The besieging army included troops raised in the Welsh Marches and the Midlands, as well as levies from the north which had already mustered on account of the earlier Scottish raids. By the end of the month, this force had been augmented by noble retinues, a muster at Newcastle, and the assembly of the English fleet in the River Tyne. Accompanying the army were craftsmen to build siege engines. Edward had arranged for the combined army to be supplied by sea through the small port of Tweedmouth.

Sir Archibald Douglas was Guardian of the Realm for the underage David and he assembled an army north of the border. The chronicles of the time variously claim they numbered 14,629, 30,000, 40,000, 80,000, 90,000, more than 100,000 or that they outnumbered the English five to one. Rogers believes that around 15,000 is plausible. A high proportion were mounted, but nearly all of them would dismount when fighting was expected. The Scots launched minor raids into Cumberland, which achieved little. Douglas assembled ever more troops, rather than using those he already had to attempt to draw the English away from Berwick. This inactivity contrasts with Robert Bruce&#x27;s swift response to the English siege of Berwick in 1319. Edward exploited the Cumberland raids to claim that his invasion was a response to them.

By the end of June attacks by land and sea had brought Berwick to a state of ruin and the garrison close to exhaustion. It is believed that a desire for a respite from the plunging fire of the two large counterweight trebuchets used by the English was a significant factor in causing the town&#x27;s governor, Sir Alexander Seton, to request a short truce from Edward. This was granted, but only on the condition that he surrender if not relieved by 11 July. Seton&#x27;s son, Thomas, was to be a hostage to the agreement, along with eleven others.

=== Relief force ===
Douglas was now faced with a choice of abandoning Berwick to fall to the English or attempting to go to its relief and risking a pitched battle. The modern historian Ranald Nicholson considers &quot;If Berwick were to be saved immediate action on the part of the Scottish guardian was unavoidable&quot;. The army Douglas had spent so much time gathering was now compelled to take to the field. Douglas entered England on 11July, the last day of Seton&#x27;s truce. He advanced eastwards to Tweedmouth and destroyed it in sight of the English army. Edward did not move.

On the afternoon of 12 July Sir William Keith, with Sir Alexander Gray and Sir William Prenderguest, led a force of around 200 Scottish cavalry towards Berwick. With some difficulty, they forced their way across the ruins of a bridge over the Tweed to the north bank and made their way into the town. Douglas considered the town relieved. On 13 July he sent messages to Edward calling on him to depart, threatening that if he failed to do so, the Scots army would devastate England. Edward ignored them. The defenders argued that Keith&#x27;s 200 horsemen constituted a relief according to the truce and therefore they did not have to surrender. Edward stated this was not the case: they had to be relieved directly from Scotlandliterally from the direction of Scotlandwhereas Keith, Gray and Prenderguest had approached Berwick from the direction of England. Edward ruled that the truce agreement had been breached – the town having neither surrendered nor been relieved. A gallows was constructed in sight of the town walls and, as the highest-ranking hostage, Thomas Seton was hanged while his parents watched. Edward issued instructions that each day the town failed to surrender, another two hostages should be hanged.

Keith took over command of the town from Seton and concluded a fresh truce on 15 July, promising to surrender if not relieved by sunset on 19July. The truce comprised two indentures, one between Edward and the town of Berwick and the other between Edward and Patrick Dunbar, Earl of March, the Keeper of Berwick Castle. It defined circumstances in which relief would or would not be considered to have occurred. The terms of surrender were not unconditional. The town was to be returned to English soil and law but the inhabitants were to be allowed to leave, with their goods and chattels, under a safe conduct from Edward. All members of the garrison would also be given free passage. Relief was defined as one of three events: 200 Scottish men-at-arms fighting their way into Berwick; the Scottish army forcing its way across a specific stretch of the River Tweed; or, defeat of the English army in open battle on Scottish soil. The garrison was also permitted to sortie to assist any relief attempt by the main Scottish army. On concluding the new treaty, Keith was allowed to immediately leave Berwick, travel to wherever the Guardian of Scotland happened to be, advise him of the terms of the treaty, and return safely to Berwick.

By this time Douglas had marched south to Bamburgh, where Edward&#x27;s queen Philippa was still staying, and besieged it; Douglas hoped this would cause Edward to break off his siege. In 1319 Edward&#x27;s father, Edward II, had broken off a siege of Berwick after a Scottish army had advanced on York, where his queen was staying, and devastated Yorkshire. Edward ignored the threat to Bamburgh as the Scots did not have the time to construct the kind of equipment that would be necessary to take the fortress by assault. They devastated the countryside but Edward ignored this too. He positioned the English army on Halidon Hill, a small rise of some , to the north-west of Berwick, which gives an excellent view of the town and the vicinity. From this vantage point, he dominated the crossing of the Tweed specified in the indentures and would have been able to attack the flank of any force of men-at-arms attempting to enter Berwick. A contemporary account estimates the size of the English army at 10,000 men, although Rogers suggests desertion and the expiry of terms of service would have reduced it to significantly fewer and that it is possible the English were outnumbered two to one. Edward detached 700 men-at-arms and an unknown number of archers and infantry to guard against a sortie by the Berwick garrison. Receiving Keith&#x27;s news, Douglas felt his only option was to engage the English in battle.

== Battle ==

=== Scottish advance ===

Crossing the Tweed to the west of the English position, the Scottish army reached the town of Duns, from Berwick, on 18July. On the following day it approached Halidon Hill from the north-west. This approach put the English between the Scottish army and the Tweed; an English defeat would probably be a disaster. The Scots halted on a nearby hill and formed up in a defensive formation. They expected the English to come to them, but instead Edward deployed his army as infantry, with his men-at-arms and spearmen in three divisions, which were known as &quot;battles&quot;, arrayed in an arc. The many longbowmen in the army were deployed evenly on each flank. With both sides seeking the advantage of a defensive posture, a stalemate ensued.

A contemporary chronicler reported Edward as being &quot;joyous and happy&quot; that he had drawn the Scots into an open battle. The state of his army&#x27;s morale is less certain: they were outnumbered and had no ready path of retreat. One chronicler reported they were of &quot;brave spirit&quot;, another that they were &quot;very cast down&quot;. Scottish morale was high: they had the larger force and all of the leading figures of the nation were present and urging them on. Douglas gave a rousing speech and ordered that no prisoners should be taken. The Scots challenged the English to send out a champion to engage in single combat. Robert Benhale of Norfolk fought a Scottish champion named Turnbull and his large dog between the armies and killed both. Still neither army moved.

One contemporary account claims the Scots were waiting for high tide on the Tweed, to minimise the possibility of English escapees after a Scottish victory. The Scots were under pressure to attack and defeat the English to prevent the fall of Berwick, while the English knew that if no battle took place Berwick would be obliged to surrender to them the next day. Modern historians agree that the prudent course of action for the Scots would have been to withdraw and wait for a better opportunity to fight. However, Jonathan Sumption points out that this would have guaranteed the loss of Berwick. Rogers states that &quot;it may seem surprising&quot; that the Scots attacked even under these circumstances. Kelly DeVries writes that &quot;the Scots ... did not want to fight&quot; but were &quot;forced to respond&quot;. A little after noon Douglas ordered an assault.

=== Scottish attack ===

To engage the English, the Scots had to advance downhill, cross a large area of marshy ground and then climb the northern slope of Halidon Hill. The Scots advanced to the sound of horns, drums, bagpipes and war cries. They were reported as &quot;covering the ground like locusts&quot;. The Battle of Dupplin Moor the previous year had shown how vulnerable the Scots were to English longbows and so they came through the marshy hollow and up the north slope of Halidon Hill as fast as they could while still maintaining formation, to minimise the time during which they were exposed to English archery. The arrows fell on the Scots &quot;as thick as motes in a sun beam&quot;, according to an unnamed contemporary. The &quot;Lanercost Chronicle&quot; reported &quot;The Scots who marched in the front were so wounded in the face and blinded by the multitude of English arrows that they could not help themselves, and soon began to turn their faces away from the blows of the arrows and fall.&quot; The Scots suffered many casualties to the English archers and the lower reaches of the hill were littered with dead and wounded. A contemporary chronicle states that thousands of Scots fell during this stage of the battle. The survivors continued upwards, towards the waiting English.

The English were disheartened by the size of the Scottish army but, aware they had no avenue of escape, stood their ground. The Scots were organised in their traditional schiltronstightly packed pike formations. The leading schiltron, commanded by the Earl of Moray, attacked the English division commanded by Balliol. A following schiltron attacked Edward&#x27;s division and a third, led by the Earls of Sutherland and Ross assailed the division of Henry Beaumont. The Scots had failed to reconnoitre the English position, or had been prevented from doing so, and its strength took them by surprise. They were also tired before they launched their assault, having marched in the previous 48 hours, and had taken heavy casualties during their approach. As the Scottish schiltrons engaged the English divisions the English archers continued to shoot into the flanks of the Scots from close range. A chronicler noted &quot;The English archers destroyed and injured them so ... and soon they were thrown into confusion.&quot;

The period of close-quarters fighting was brief. Shortly after charging into contact the Scots attacking Balliol&#x27;s division broke and routed. Almost immediately the schiltron facing Edward also broke. The third schiltron, which was tasked with fighting its way through to Berwick and so preventing its surrender, fought on &quot;with the ferocity of lions&quot; according to an English chronicle. More than 500 Scots were killed in this fight, including both of the schiltron&#x27;s noble commanders.

=== Scottish rout ===
With two of the three Scottish schiltrons fleeing, the English men-at-arms from Balliol&#x27;s and Edward&#x27;s division mounted their horses, which had been held to the rear, and pursued. From their position on the hill where the Scots had taken up their original defensive position the Scottish camp followers could see what was happening and made off on the Scottish horses, which had been left there. This forced the Scottish soldiers to either try and outrun the mounted English on foot, or band into small groups and attempt to fight off the English knights. In either case they were easily ridden down. Few prisoners were taken; most Scots who surrendered were killed, on Edward&#x27;s orders, and some drowned when they fled into the sea. At some point during this pursuit the third Scottish schiltron collapsed and joined the rout. The Scots were chased for and suffered very heavy casualties. About a hundred Scots who had been taken prisoner against Edward&#x27;s orders were beheaded the next morning, 20July. This was the date on which Berwick&#x27;s truce expired, and the town and the castle surrendered on the terms in the indentures.

The English chronicles number the Scottish dead at between 35,000 and 60,000. Scottish chronicles give 10,000 killed. Of the nine most-senior Scots present at the battle, six were killed, including Douglas. One Scottish account says that of 203 men-at-arms made knights (&quot;dubbed&quot;) immediately before the battle, only 5 survived. Many of the figures given are clearly greatly exaggerated, and Rogers suggests the total of Scottish dead may have been approximately 2,900. English casualties were reported in some chronicles as 14, while others give a lower figure of 7.

== Aftermath ==

The English believed the battle had ended the war with Scotland and Edward left for the south. Balliol and his allies rapidly quelled any remaining resistance in Scotland. They proceeded north and held a parliament at the Scottish capital, Perth, in October 1333, where Balliol restored lands to the &quot;disinherited&quot; nobles who had helped him to the throne the previous year. In doing so he dispossessed a new generation of Scots nobility of their land, thus ensuring continued conflict. Balliol had at least nominal control of most of Scotland and at one point only four fortifications remained in the hands of David II&#x27;s partisans. On 19June 1334, Balliol did homage to Edward for Scotland, after formally ceding to England the eight counties of south-east Scotland. David supporters would not admit defeat and Balliol was deposed later in 1334. Edward led a winter campaign and Balliol was restored in 1335. Balliol was deposed once again in 1336, and Edward again campaigned widely across Scotland. In 1337 the Hundred Years&#x27; War broke out with France and English efforts were concentrated on this front, allowing the young King David to consolidate his position in Scotland.

In 1346 Edward led an English army across northern France, winning the Battle of Crécy and besieging Calais. Encouraged by the French King the Scots invaded England with a large army, certain that few English troops would be left to defend the rich northern English cities. The Scots were decisively beaten at the Battle of Neville&#x27;s Cross with heavy loss and their king was captured. It was eleven years before terms were agreed for David&#x27;s release. His ransom was the very large sum of 100,000 marks, to be paid over ten years, on 24 June (St. John the Baptist&#x27;s Day) each year, during which an Anglo-Scottish truce prohibited any Scottish citizen from bearing arms against Edward III or any of his men. This truce lasted for four decades and marked the end of the Second War of Scottish Independence.

=== Battlefield today ===

The site of the battle has been entered in the Register of Historic Battlefields by Historic England due to its special historic interest. The uncultivated scrub and marsh of 1333 was enclosed around 1800, drained and now consists of agricultural fields. There is a rough stone monument to the battle near the highest point of the hill with an incised inscription, &quot;Halidon Hill 19th July 1333&quot;.

<doc id="240002" wikidata="Q29193" url="?curid=240002" title="Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet">
<text>Johann Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet (; ; 13 February 1805 – 5 May 1859) was a German mathematician. In number theory, he proved special cases of Fermat&#x27;s last theorem and created analytic number theory. In analysis, he advanced the theory of Fourier series and was one of the first to give the modern formal definition of a function. In mathematical physics, he studied potential theory, boundary-value problems, and heat diffusion, and hydrodynamics.

Although his surname is Lejeune Dirichlet, he is commonly referred to by his mononym Dirichlet, in particular for results named after him.

==Biography==

===Early life (1805–1822)===
Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet was born on 13 February 1805 in Düren, a town on the left bank of the Rhine which at the time was part of the First French Empire, reverting to Prussia after the Congress of Vienna in 1815. His father Johann Arnold Lejeune Dirichlet was the postmaster, merchant, and city councilor. His paternal grandfather had come to Düren from Richelette (or more likely ), a small community north east of Liège in Belgium, from which his surname &quot;Lejeune Dirichlet&quot; (&quot;&quot;, French for &quot;the youth from Richelette&quot;) was derived.

Although his family was not wealthy and he was the youngest of seven children, his parents supported his education. They enrolled him in an elementary school and then private school in hope that he would later become a merchant. The young Dirichlet, who showed a strong interest in mathematics before age 12, persuaded his parents to allow him to continue his studies. In 1817 they sent him to the under the care of Peter Joseph Elvenich, a student his family knew. In 1820, Dirichlet moved to the Jesuit Gymnasium in Cologne, where his lessons with Georg Ohm helped widen his knowledge in mathematics. He left the gymnasium a year later with only a certificate, as his inability to speak fluent Latin prevented him from earning the Abitur.

===Studies in Paris (1822–1826)===
Dirichlet again persuaded his parents to provide further financial support for his studies in mathematics, against their wish for a career in law. As Germany provided little opportunity to study higher mathematics at the time, with only Gauss at the University of Göttingen who was nominally a professor of astronomy and anyway disliked teaching, Dirichlet decided to go to Paris in May 1822. There he attended classes at the Collège de France and at the University of Paris, learning mathematics from Hachette among others, while undertaking private study of Gauss&#x27;s &quot;Disquisitiones Arithmeticae&quot;, a book he kept close for his entire life. In 1823 he was recommended to General Maximilien Foy, who hired him as a private tutor to teach his children German, the wage finally allowing Dirichlet to become independent from his parents&#x27; financial support.

His first original research, comprising part of a proof of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem for the case , brought him immediate fame, being the first advance in the theorem since Fermat&#x27;s own proof of the case and Euler&#x27;s proof for . Adrien-Marie Legendre, one of the referees, soon completed the proof for this case; Dirichlet completed his own proof a short time after Legendre, and a few years later produced a full proof for the case . In June 1825 he was accepted to lecture on his partial proof for the case at the French Academy of Sciences, an exceptional feat for a 20-year-old student with no degree. His lecture at the Academy had also put Dirichlet in close contact with Fourier and Poisson, who raised his interest in theoretical physics, especially Fourier&#x27;s analytic theory of heat.

===Back to Prussia, Breslau (1825–1828)===
As General Foy died in November 1825 and he could not find any paying position in France, Dirichlet had to return to Prussia. Fourier and Poisson introduced him to Alexander von Humboldt, who had been called to join the court of King Friedrich Wilhelm III. Humboldt, planning to make Berlin a center of science and research, immediately offered his help to Dirichlet, sending letters in his favour to the Prussian government and to the Prussian Academy of Sciences. Humboldt also secured a recommendation letter from Gauss, who upon reading his memoir on Fermat&#x27;s theorem wrote with an unusual amount of praise that &quot;Dirichlet showed excellent talent&quot;. With the support of Humboldt and Gauss, Dirichlet was offered a teaching position at the University of Breslau. However, as he had not passed a doctoral dissertation, he submitted his memoir on the Fermat theorem as a thesis to the University of Bonn. Again his lack of fluency in Latin rendered him unable to hold the required public disputation of his thesis; after much discussion, the university decided to bypass the problem by awarding him an honorary doctorate in February 1827. Also, the Minister of Education granted him a dispensation for the Latin disputation required for the Habilitation. Dirichlet earned the Habilitation and lectured in the 1827–28 year as a Privatdozent at Breslau.

While in Breslau, Dirichlet continued his number-theoretic research, publishing important contributions to the biquadratic reciprocity law which at the time was a focal point of Gauss&#x27;s research. Alexander von Humboldt took advantage of these new results, which had also drawn enthusiastic praise from Friedrich Bessel, to arrange for him the desired transfer to Berlin. Given Dirichlet&#x27;s young age (he was 23 years old at the time), Humboldt was able to get him only a trial position at the Prussian Military Academy in Berlin while remaining nominally employed by the University of Breslau. The probation was extended for three years until the position becoming definite in 1831.

===Marriage to Rebecka Mendelssohn===

After Dirichlet&#x27;s move to Berlin, Humboldt introduced him to the great salons held by the banker Abraham Mendelssohn Bartholdy and his family. Their house was a weekly gathering point for Berlin artists and scientists, including Abraham&#x27;s children Felix and Fanny Mendelssohn, both outstanding musicians, and the painter Wilhelm Hensel (Fanny&#x27;s husband). Dirichlet showed great interest in Abraham&#x27;s daughter Rebecka, whom he married in 1832.
Rebecka Henriette Lejeune Dirichlet (née Rebecka Mendelssohn; 11 April 1811 – 1 December 1858) was a granddaughter of Moses Mendelssohn and the youngest sister of Felix Mendelssohn and Fanny Mendelssohn. Rebecka was born in Hamburg. In 1816 her parents arranged for her to be baptised at which point she took the names Rebecka Henriette Mendelssohn Bartholdy. She became a part of the notable &quot;salon&quot; of her parents, Abraham Mendelssohn and his wife Lea, having social contacts with the important musicians, artists and scientists in a highly creative period of German intellectual life. In 1829 she sang a small role in the premiere, given at the Mendelssohn house, of Felix&#x27;s Singspiel &quot;Die Heimkehr aus der Fremde.&quot; She later wrote:
My older brother and sister stole my reputation as an artist. In any other family I would have been highly regarded as a musician and perhaps been leader of a group. Next to Felix and Fanny, I could not aspire to any recognition. 

In 1832 she married Dirichlet, who was introduced to the Mendelssohn family by Alexander von Humboldt. In 1833 their first son, Walter, was born. She died in Göttingen in 1858.

===Berlin (1826–1855)===

As soon as he came to Berlin, Dirichlet applied to lecture at the University of Berlin, and the Education Minister approved the transfer and in 1831 assigned him to the faculty of philosophy. The faculty required him to undertake a renewed habilitation qualification, and although Dirichlet wrote a &quot;Habilitationsschrift&quot; as needed, he postponed giving the mandatory lecture in Latin for another 20 years, until 1851. As he had not completed this formal requirement, he remained attached to the faculty with less than full rights, including restricted emoluments, forcing him to keep in parallel his teaching position at the Military School. In 1832 Dirichlet became a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences, the youngest member at only 27 years old.

Dirichlet had a good reputation with students for the clarity of his explanations and enjoyed teaching, especially as his University lectures tended to be on the more advanced topics in which he was doing research: number theory (he was the first German professor to give lectures on number theory), analysis and mathematical physics. He advised the doctoral theses of several important German mathematicians, as Gotthold Eisenstein, Leopold Kronecker, Rudolf Lipschitz and Carl Wilhelm Borchardt, while being influential in the mathematical formation of many other scientists, including Elwin Bruno Christoffel, Wilhelm Weber, Eduard Heine, Ludwig von Seidel and Julius Weingarten. At the Military Academy, Dirichlet managed to introduce differential and integral calculus in the curriculum, raising the level of scientific education there. However, he gradually started feeling that his double teaching load, at the Military academy and at the university, was limiting the time available for his research.

While in Berlin, Dirichlet kept in contact with other mathematicians. In 1829, during a trip, he met Carl Jacobi, at the time professor of mathematics at Königsberg University. Over the years they kept meeting and corresponding on research matters, in time becoming close friends. In 1839, during a visit to Paris, Dirichlet met Joseph Liouville, the two mathematicians becoming friends, keeping in contact and even visiting each other with the families a few years later. In 1839, Jacobi sent Dirichlet a paper by Ernst Kummer, at the time a schoolteacher. Realizing Kummer&#x27;s potential, they helped him get elected in the Berlin Academy and, in 1842, obtained for him a full professor position at the University of Breslau. In 1840 Kummer married Ottilie Mendelssohn, a cousin of Rebecka&#x27;s.

In 1843, when Jacobi fell ill, Dirichlet traveled to Königsberg to help him, then obtained for him the assistance of King Friedrich Wilhelm IV&#x27;s personal physician. When the physician recommended that Jacobi spend some time in Italy, Dirichlet joined him on the trip together with his family. They were accompanied to Italy by Ludwig Schläfli, who came as a translator; as he was strongly interested in mathematics, both Dirichlet and Jacobi lectured to him during the trip, and he later became an important mathematician himself. The Dirichlet family extended their stay in Italy to 1845, their daughter Flora being born there. In 1844, Jacobi moved to Berlin as a royal pensioner, their friendship becoming even closer. In 1846, when the Heidelberg University tried to recruit Dirichlet, Jacobi provided von Humboldt the needed support to obtain a doubling of Dirichlet&#x27;s pay at the university in order to keep him in Berlin; however, even then he was not paid a full professor wage and could not leave the Military Academy.

Holding liberal views, Dirichlet and his family supported the 1848 revolution; he even guarded with a rifle the palace of the Prince of Prussia. After the revolution failed, the Military Academy closed temporarily, causing him a large loss of income. When it reopened, the environment became more hostile to him, as officers he was teaching were expected to be loyal to the constituted government. Some of the press who had not sided with the revolution pointed him out, as well as Jacobi and other liberal professors, as &quot;the red contingent of the staff&quot;.

In 1849 Dirichlet participated, together with his friend Jacobi, in the jubilee of Gauss&#x27;s doctorate.

===Göttingen (1855–1859)===
Despite Dirichlet&#x27;s expertise and the honours he received, and even though, by 1851, he had finally completed all formal requirements for a full professor, the issue of raising his pay at the university still dragged on and he was still unable to leave the Military Academy. In 1855, upon Gauss&#x27;s death, the University of Göttingen decided to call Dirichlet as his successor. Given the difficulties faced in Berlin, he decided to accept the offer and immediately moved to Göttingen with his family. Kummer was called to assume his position as a professor of mathematics in Berlin.

Dirichlet enjoyed his time in Göttingen, as the lighter teaching load allowed him more time for research and he came into close contact with the new generation of researchers, especially Richard Dedekind and Bernhard Riemann. After moving to Göttingen he was able to obtain a small annual stipend for Riemann to retain him in the teaching staff there. Dedekind, Riemann, Moritz Cantor and Alfred Enneper, although they had all already earned their PhDs, attended Dirichlet&#x27;s classes to study with him. Dedekind, who felt that there were gaps in his mathematics education, considered that the occasion to study with Dirichlet made him &quot;a new human being&quot;. He later edited and published Dirichlet&#x27;s lectures and other results in number theory under the title (&quot;Lectures on Number Theory&quot;).

In the summer of 1858, during a trip to Montreux, Dirichlet suffered a heart attack. On 5 May 1859, he died in Göttingen, several months after the death of his wife Rebecka. Dirichlet&#x27;s brain is preserved in the department of physiology at the University of Göttingen, along with the brain of Gauss. The Academy in Berlin honored him with a formal memorial speech presented by Kummer in 1860, and later ordered the publication of his collected works edited by Kronecker and Lazarus Fuchs.

==Mathematics research==
===Number theory===
Number theory was Dirichlet&#x27;s main research interest, a field in which he found several deep results and in proving them introduced some fundamental tools, many of which were later named after him. In 1837, Dirichlet proved his theorem on arithmetic progressions using concepts from mathematical analysis to tackle an algebraic problem, thus creating the branch of analytic number theory. In proving the theorem, he introduced the Dirichlet characters and L-functions. In that article, he also noted the difference between the absolute and conditional convergence of series and its impact in what was later called the Riemann series theorem. In 1841, he generalized his arithmetic progressions theorem from integers to the ring of Gaussian integers formula_1.

In a couple of papers in 1838 and 1839, he proved the first class number formula for quadratic forms (later refined by his student Kronecker). The formula, which Jacobi called a result &quot;touching the utmost of human acumen&quot;, opened the way for similar results regarding more general number fields. Based on his research of the structure of the unit group of quadratic fields, he proved the Dirichlet unit theorem, a fundamental result in algebraic number theory.

He first used the pigeonhole principle, a basic counting argument, in the proof of a theorem in diophantine approximation, later named after him Dirichlet&#x27;s approximation theorem. He published important contributions to Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem, for which he proved the cases and , and to the biquadratic reciprocity law. The Dirichlet divisor problem, for which he found the first results by introducing the Dirichlet hyperbola method, is still an unsolved problem in number theory despite later contributions by other mathematicians.

===Analysis===

Inspired by the work of his mentor in Paris, Dirichlet published in 1829 a famous memoir giving the conditions, showing for which functions the convergence of the Fourier series holds. Before Dirichlet&#x27;s solution, not only Fourier, but also Poisson and Cauchy had tried unsuccessfully to find a rigorous proof of convergence. The memoir pointed out Cauchy&#x27;s mistake and introduced Dirichlet&#x27;s test for the convergence of series. It also introduced the Dirichlet function as an example of a function that is not integrable (the definite integral was still a developing topic at the time) and, in the proof of the theorem for the Fourier series, introduced the Dirichlet kernel and the Dirichlet integral.

Dirichlet also studied the first boundary-value problem, for the Laplace equation, proving the uniqueness of the solution; this type of problem in the theory of partial differential equations was later named the Dirichlet problem after him. A function satisfying a partial differential equation subject to the Dirichlet boundary conditions must have fixed values on the boundary. In the proof he notably used the principle that the solution is the function that minimizes the so-called Dirichlet energy. Riemann later named this approach the Dirichlet principle, although he knew it had also been used by Gauss and by Lord Kelvin.

=== Introduction of the modern concept of function===
While trying to gauge the range of functions for which convergence of the Fourier series can be shown, Dirichlet defines a function by the property that &quot;to any &quot;x&quot; there corresponds a single finite &quot;y&quot;&quot;, but then restricts his attention to piecewise continuous functions. Based on this, he is credited with introducing the modern concept of a function, as opposed to the older vague understanding of a function as an analytic formula. Imre Lakatos cites Hermann Hankel as the early origin of this attribution, but disputes the claim saying that &quot;there is ample evidence that he had no idea of this concept [...] for instance when he discusses piecewise continuous functions, he says that at points of discontinuity, the function has two values&quot;.

===Other fields===
Dirichlet also worked in mathematical physics, lecturing and publishing research in potential theory (including the Dirichlet problem and Dirichlet principle mentioned above), the theory of heat and hydrodynamics. He improved on Lagrange&#x27;s work on conservative systems by showing that the condition for equilibrium is that the potential energy is minimal.

Dirichlet also lectured on probability theory and least squares, introducing some original methods and results, in particular for limit theorems and an improvement of Laplace&#x27;s method of approximation related to the central limit theorem. The Dirichlet distribution and the Dirichlet process, based on the Dirichlet integral, are named after him.

==Honors==
Dirichlet was elected as a member of several academies:
* Prussian Academy of Sciences (1832)
* Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences (1833) – corresponding member
* Göttingen Academy of Sciences (1846)
* French Academy of Sciences (1854) – foreign member
* Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (1854)
* Royal Belgian Academy of Sciences (1855)
* Royal Society (1855) – foreign member

In 1855 Dirichlet was awarded the civil class medal of the Pour le Mérite order at Alexander von Humboldt&#x27;s recommendation. The Dirichlet crater on the Moon and the 11665 Dirichlet asteroid are named after him.

<text>Kangaroo rats, small mostly nocturnal rodents of genus Dipodomys, are native to arid areas of western North America. The common name derives from their bipedal form. They hop in a manner similar to the much larger kangaroo, but developed this mode of locomotion independently, like several other clades of rodents (e.g., dipodids and hopping mice).

==Description==
Kangaroo rats are four or five-toed heteromyid rodents with big hind legs, small front legs, and relatively large heads. Adults typically weigh between The tail of a kangaroo rat is longer than its body and head combined. Another notable feature of kangaroo rats is their fur-lined cheek pouches, which are used for storing food. The coloration of kangaroo rats varies from cinnamon buff to dark gray, depending on the species. There is also some variation in length with one of the largest species, the banner-tailed kangaroo rat being six inches in body length and a tail length of eight inches. Sexual dimorphism exists in all species, with males being larger than females.

===Locomotion===
Kangaroo rats move bipedally. Kangaroo rats often leap a distance of 7 feet, and reportedly up to 9 feet (2.75 m)
at speeds up to almost 10 feet/sec, or 11 km/h (7 mph). They can quickly change direction between jumps. The rapid locomotion of the banner-tailed kangaroo rat may maximise energy cost and minimise predation risk. Its use of a &quot;move-freeze&quot; mode may also make it less conspicuous to nocturnal predators.

==Ecology==

===Range and habitat===
Kangaroo rats live in arid and semiarid areas, particularly on sandy or soft soils which are suitable for burrowing. They can, however, vary in both geographic range and habitat. Their elevation range depends on the species; they are found from below sea level to at least 7,100 feet (the type locality of &quot;D. ordii priscus&quot;). They are sensitive to extreme temperatures and remain in their burrows during rain storms and other forms of inclement weather. Kangaroo rats are preyed on by coyotes, foxes, badgers, weasels, owls, and snakes.

Merriam&#x27;s kangaroo rats live in areas of high rainfall and humidity, and high summer temperature and evaporation rates. They prefer areas of stony soils, including clays, gravel, and rocks, which are harder than soils preferred by some other species (like banner-tailed kangaroo rats). Because their habitats are hot and dry, they must conserve water. They do this in part by lowering their metabolic rate, which reduces the loss of water through their skin and respiratory system. Evaporation through the skin is the major route of loss. Merriam&#x27;s kangaroo rats obtain enough water from the metabolic oxidation of the seeds they eat to survive and do not need to drink water at all. To help conserve water they produce very concentrated urine, via a process apparently associated with expression of aquaporin 1 along a longer than usual segment of the descending limb of the loop of Henle in the kidney.

In contrast, banner-tailed kangaroo rats have more specific habitat requirements for desert grasslands with scattered shrubs; this species is also more threatened because of the decline in these grasslands. These are also dry areas but they tend to have more water available to them than Merriam&#x27;s kangaroo rats.

===Food and foraging===
Kangaroo rats are primarily seed eaters. They will, however, eat vegetation occasionally, and at some times of the year, possibly insects as well. They have been seen storing the seeds of mesquite, creosote bush, purslane, ocotillo, and grama grass in their cheek pouches. Kangaroo rats will store extra seeds in seed caches. This caching behavior affects the rangeland and croplands where the animals live. Kangaroo rats must harvest as much seed as possible in as little time as possible. To conserve energy and water, they minimize their time away from their cool, dry burrows. In addition, maximizing time in their burrows minimizes their exposure to predators.

When on foraging trips, kangaroo rats hoard the seeds that they find. It is important for a kangaroo rat to encounter more food items than are consumed, at least at one point in the year, as well as defend or rediscover food caches and remain within the same areas long enough to utilize food resources. Different species of kangaroo rat may have different seed caching strategies to coexist with each other, as is the case for the banner-tailed kangaroo rat and Merriam&#x27;s kangaroo rat which have overlapping ranges. Merriam&#x27;s kangaroo rats scatterhoard small caches of seeds in numerous small, shallow holes they dig. This is initially done close to the food source, maximizing harvest rates and reducing travel costs, but later redistributed more widely, minimizing theft by other rodents. Banner-tailed kangaroo rats larderhoard a sizable cache of seeds within the large mounds they occupy. This could decrease their time and energy expenses; they also spend less time on the surface digging holes, reducing the risk of predation. Being larger and more sedentary, they are better able to defend these larders from depredations by other rodents.

==Behavior==

Kangaroo rats inhabit overlapping home ranges. These home ranges tend to be small with most activities within 200–300 ft and rarely 600 ft. Home range size can vary within species with Merriam&#x27;s kangaroo rats having larger home ranges than banner-tailed kangaroo rats. Recently weaned kangaroo rats move into new areas not occupied by adults. Within its home range, a kangaroo rat has a defended territory consisting of its burrowing system.

===Burrow system===
Kangaroo rats live in complex burrow systems. The burrows have separate chambers used for specific purposes like sleeping, living, and food storage. The spacing of the burrows depends on the number of kangaroo rats and the abundance of food. Kangaroo rats also live in colonies that range from six to several hundred dens. The burrow of a kangaroo rat is important in providing protection from the harsh desert environment. To maintain a constant temperature and relative humidity in their burrows, kangaroo rats plug the entrances with soil during the day. When the outside temperature is too hot, a kangaroo rat stays in its cool, humid burrow and leaves it only at night. To reduce loss of moisture through respiration when sleeping, a kangaroo rat buries its nose in its fur to accumulate a small pocket of moist air. The burrows of Merriam&#x27;s kangaroo rats are simpler and shallower than those of banner-tailed kangaroo rats. Banner-tailed kangaroo rats also mate in their burrows, unlike Merriam&#x27;s kangaroo rats.

===Social interactions===
Kangaroo rats are generally solitary animals with little social organization. Kangaroo rats communicate during competitive interactions and courtship. They do cluster together in some feeding situations. Groups of kangaroo rats that exist are aggregations and colonies. There appears to be a dominance hierarchy among male kangaroo rats in competition for access to females. Male kangaroo rats are generally more aggressive than females and are more dominant over them. Females are more tolerant of each other than males are and have more non-aggressive interactions. This is likely in part because the home ranges of females overlap less than the home ranges of males. Linear dominance hierarchies appear to exist among males but it is not known if this is the case for females. Winners of aggressive encounters appear to be the most active individuals.

===Mating and reproduction===
Kangaroo rats have a promiscuous mating system. Their reproductive output is highest in summer following high rainfalls. During droughts and food shortages, only a few females will breed. It appears that kangaroo rats can assess their local conditions and adjust their reproductive efforts accordingly. Merriam&#x27;s kangaroo rats breed between December and May and produce two or three litters per year. Before mating, the male and female will perform nasal-anal circling until the female stops and allows the male to mount her. A Merriam&#x27;s kangaroo rat female will allow multiple males to mount her in a short time, perhaps to ensure greater chances of producing offspring. Mating in banner-tailed kangaroo rats involves more chasing and foot drumming in the male before the female allows him to mate. Banner-tailed kangaroo rats mate on mounds and the more successful males chase away rival males. The gestation period of kangaroo rats lasts 22–27 days.

The young are born in a fur-lined nest in the burrows. They are born blind and hairless. For the first week, young Merriam kangaroo rats crawl, developing their hind legs in their second or third week. At this time, the young become independent. Banner-tailed kangaroo rats are weaned between 22 and 25 days. Offspring remain in the mound for one or six more months in the maternal caches.

<doc id="240009" wikidata="Q546280" url="?curid=240009" title="Montreal Maroons">
<text>The Montreal Maroons (officially the Montreal Professional Hockey Club) were a professional ice hockey team in the National Hockey League (NHL). They played in the NHL from 1924 to 1938, winning the Stanley Cup in 1926 and 1935. They were the last non-Original Six team to win the Stanley Cup until the Philadelphia Flyers in 1974.

Founded as a team for the English community in Montreal, they shared their home city with the Canadiens, who eventually came under the same ownership as the Maroons but were intended to appeal to the French Canadian population. This was the first time since 1918, when the Montreal Wanderers folded, that Montreal had a second major-league professional hockey team. In order to accommodate the Maroons, a new arena was built for them in 1924, the Montreal Forum. The Maroons were a highly competitive team, winning the Stanley Cup twice and finishing first in their Canadian Division twice more. Some of the best players of the era played for the Maroons; eleven players were elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame, while five of the six head coaches of the Maroons were also honoured.

Financial difficulties resulting from the Great Depression led to the Maroons suspending play after 1938. Despite efforts to revive the team, the franchise was cancelled in 1947, leaving the Canadiens as the sole NHL team in Montreal. Since the Maroons&#x27; demise, no NHL team that has won a Stanley Cup at any point in its history has subsequently folded or relocated.

==History==

===Formation===

The Montreal Maroons ice hockey team was created to appeal to the anglophone neighbourhoods of Montreal. On January 2, 1918, the Montreal Arena, shared by the Montreal Canadiens and the Montreal Wanderers, burned down. The Canadiens, who drew primarily Montreal&#x27;s francophones, moved to the Jubilee Arena which, in 1919, also burned down, before settling in the Mount Royal Arena, which had natural ice and seating for 3,250 spectators. The Wanderers, team of Montreal&#x27;s anglophone community, folded. By 1922, work began to build a team to appeal to the anglophones and return to the NHL. In July 1924, construction began on a new arena, on the site of a former roller-skating rink known as the Forum. By fall, at a cost of , the Montreal Forum was complete. The Montreal Forum was the first large arena in the NHL. The Maroons joined the NHL in 1924, along with the league&#x27;s first United States-based team, the Boston Bruins. The Canadiens initially objected to a second team in Montreal, but relented when compensated by the expansion fee. The expansion fee for each team was . The Canadiens, the local rivals of the Maroons, received $11,000 of the Maroons&#x27; fee. While the Canadiens&#x27; owner initially lodged a formal objection to ensure he would get adequate compensation for sharing his franchise&#x27;s territory, he was actually quite enthusiastic about having a second franchise in the same city; rather, he would later state, he &quot;saw in them an important and lucrative local rivalry.&quot;
At the time of their founding, the Maroons had no nickname. The Maroons&#x27; president, James Strachan, had been the owner of the Wanderers in the 1900s. He attempted to secure the Wanderers name, but negotiations failed (Wanderers&#x27; last owner Sam Lichtenhein wanted ), so the club was known by its official name, the Montreal Professional Hockey Club. With the team introducing maroon-coloured sweaters complete with a large capital letter &quot;M&quot; for a logo (the letter officially stood for their home city, not the colour), the &quot;Maroons&quot; nickname was picked up by the media. The club never officially changed the organizational name to incorporate the Maroons name.

===Success at the gate and on the ice===
In the Maroons&#x27; first season, they finished second to last in the league. However, the new Forum was selling out and, with the addition of players like Nels Stewart, Babe Siebert and Merlyn Phillips, success came quickly. In a single year, the Maroons went from having their worst record in franchise history to their best. In only their second season, Montreal won their first Stanley Cup. The NHL playoffs that year were a two-game, total-goals format. Montreal won the opening series over the Pittsburgh Pirates 6–4, then upset the favored Ottawa Senators 2–1. In the NHL playoff final, Montreal defeated Ottawa to advance to the 1926 Stanley Cup Finals against the Victoria Cougars of the Western Hockey League (WHL). In the last Stanley Cup Finals involving two different leagues, Montreal defeated Victoria three games to one. Contributing to the victory was rookie, and future Hall of Fame member, Nels Stewart, who scored six of the Maroons&#x27; 10 goals in the series. Stewart won the Hart Trophy as most valuable player. While not a smooth skater, Stewart compensated with size (at and , he was a giant compared to other players of that era), toughness (amassing 119 penalty minutes), and shooting (scoring 34 of Montreal&#x27;s 91 goals during the season). Stewart&#x27;s 34 goals remained an NHL record for rookies until the 1970–71 season. During this era, team&#x27;s best players often played the entire game with substitutions only made for injuries.

For the 1926–27 season, the NHL expanded to 10 teams and was divided into American and Canadian divisions. The Maroons finished third in the Canadian Division, behind their rivals the Canadiens, with whom they now shared the Forum. The two teams met in the playoffs for a two-game, total-goals series. The Forum was packed with 11,000 fans, in a building whose capacity was listed at 10,000, to watch the Canadiens defeat the defending Stanley Cup champions. The Maroons also participated in another moment of ice hockey history when, on November 26, 1926, they were the competition in the New York Rangers&#x27; NHL debut game.

The Maroons got revenge on the Canadiens in the 1927–28 season, by eliminating them in the semifinals of the playoffs. The Maroons then met the New York Rangers for the 1928 Stanley Cup Finals, but lost the series 3–2. Because the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus occupied Madison Square Garden, all five games were played at the Forum.

The 1928–29 season was an oddly bad season for the Maroons, as they finished last in the Canadian Division. However, they rebounded the following season by finishing first. During these years, the Maroons were led by one of the most feared forward lines in the early NHL years, the &quot;S Line&quot;, consisting of Hooley Smith, Babe Siebert and Nels Stewart, which was also one of the most penalized.

In the 1929–30 season, Dunc Munro was signed as player-coach of the team. It was during this season, that Clint Benedict of the Maroons became the first goaltender in NHL history to wear a mask when he donned one to protect a broken nose. Although the Maroons finished first in the Canadian Division, they were eliminated in the semifinals by the Boston Bruins.

For the 1930–31 season, Stewart again led his team in goals and points, but the Maroons only finished third in the Canadian Division, and were eliminated easily in the first round of the playoffs by the New York Rangers.

The Maroons made it into the playoffs of the 1931–32 season, by finishing five points ahead of the New York Americans. Montreal defeated the Detroit Falcons in the first round, but lost the semifinals against the Toronto Maple Leafs.

The Maroons finished the 1932–33 season in second place in the Canadian Division and even had three of the top six players in league points. However, Montreal was eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Detroit Red Wings.

In the playoffs of the 1933–34 season, the Chicago Black Hawks eliminated both Montreal teams, first defeating the Canadiens, then upsetting the Maroons in the semifinals.

In 1935, Leo Dandurand, owner of the Montreal Canadiens, sold the team to Canadian Arena Company (Ernest Savard, Louis Gelinas and Maurice Forget), which also owned the Montreal Maroons, for $165,000.

===Great Depression and cessation of operations===

In Montreal, financial strains from the Great Depression hurt the attendances of both the Canadiens and Maroons. However, there were far more francophone supporters for the Canadiens than anglophone supporters for the Maroons. As a result, the Maroons finished with the worst attendance in the league, three seasons in a row. Also, by 1935, both teams were owned by Canadian Arena Company (Ernest Savard and Maurice Forget, who owned the Canadiens, were part of the Canadian Arena Company, as were Maroons owners James Strachan and Donat Raymond). It became obvious that only one team could represent Montreal. The Maroons&#x27; dire financial straits caused them to sell off several players, including star winger Hooley Smith. Despite the Maroons&#x27; financial troubles, they continued to play competitive ice hockey well into the 1930s.
For the 1934–35 season, the Maroons hired Tommy Gorman as coach, who had coached the Chicago Black Hawks to the 1934 Stanley Cup. The Maroons finished the season in second place behind Toronto. In the playoffs, the Maroons defeated Chicago with defensive ice hockey, defeated the New York Rangers at wide-open (offensive) ice hockey, and then defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs, who Gorman considered one of the best ice hockey teams of all time, in three straight games. The Maroons won their second Stanley Cup; Gorman remains the only coach in history to win back-to-back Cups with two different teams. The Maroons team were the last team to win the Stanley Cup without a loss in the playoffs for 17 years. Gorman called this Maroons team &quot;the greatest team that ever stepped on the ice.&quot;

The playoffs of the 1935–36 season are famous for the longest NHL playoff game of all time. On March 24, 1936, the Maroons lost 1–0 to the Detroit Red Wings in 176:30 of play (16:30 of the sixth overtime period). The game was especially significant for Detroit goaltender Normie Smith, who began his career with the Maroons. He shut out the Maroons again in the second game, and allowed Detroit to complete a three-game sweep by allowing only one goal. Detroit proceeded to win the first Stanley Cup in their history.

In December 1936, Maroons captain Hooley Smith was traded to the Boston Bruins, a move which would mark the beginning of the end for the franchise. The 1936–37 season saw Nels Stewart break Howie Morenz&#x27;s record for career goals with 271. Stewart would hold the all-time career record for goals until it was broken by Maurice Richard in 1952.

By the start of the 1937–38 season, rumours were rampant that the Maroons franchise would be moved to another city. In September 1937, Maroons president Donat Raymond said the team would be staying in Montreal. The team&#x27;s bleak financial situation finally caught up with them as they finished 12–30–6, the club&#x27;s worst season since winning only nine games in 1924–25. Lionel Conacher retired prior to the season to enter politics, winning a seat in the 1937 Ontario general election as a member of the Liberal Party. Tommy Gorman had tried to convince Conacher to stay with the Maroons and take over as coach; his retirement led Gorman to hire King Clancy. Clancy did not help improve the team&#x27;s record, and on December 29, 1937, he was fired after 18 games and Gorman was re-instated as coach. The last game for the Maroons franchise, was a 6–3 loss on March 17, 1938, against the Canadiens. They finished the season with a record of 12 wins, 30 losses and 6 ties for 30 points in 48 games, placing the team last in the Canadian Division and last overall in the league.

At the annual league meeting on June 22, 1938, the Maroons formally asked the league to suspend the franchise for a year; this was refused, and the league asked the Maroons to confirm by August 1 if they were to participate in the upcoming season or not.

The league allowed the Maroons to suspend operations for the 1938–39 season. Lacking a formal dispersal draft, some of the Maroons were transferred to the Canadiens. Most of the Maroons players were either sold to the remaining NHL teams or washed out of the league altogether.

===Attempted revival===
The Maroons&#x27; owners tried to sell their dormant franchise to interests in St. Louis, but doubts regarding the previous failure of the St. Louis Eagles led to the league refusing permission. At the 1945 annual league meeting, held on September 7, it was noted that the backers of the Maroons franchise were in discussion to sell to a group from Philadelphia fronted by Canadiens board member Len Peto. The league governors were prepared to approve the transfer, provided the Philadelphia group could prove they had the necessary funds for a team. They also made sure to clarify that the Maroons franchise rights would expire in April 1947 unless something was done with them.

Peto was able to get the necessary funding, and persuaded the league to transfer the Maroons to Philadelphia. However, despite being larger than all but two NHL cities, Philadelphia did not have an arena that could accommodate an NHL team. The Palestra at the University of Pennsylvania did not have an ice plant, and both Penn and Madison Square Garden, which managed the Palestra, balked at the expense of installing one. Neither was the city-owned Convention Hall equipped to produce ice. The only arena in the city with an ice plant, Philadelphia Arena, was ruled out because its sight lines and capacity (5,500) were deemed inadequate even for temporary use. The league refused to extend its deadline to give Peto more time to find or build a suitable arena. In February 1946, Peto announced plans to build a 20,000-seat arena on the site of the old Baker Bowl at a cost of . However, when his group was unable to get funding for the project by the league-imposed deadline, the NHL cancelled the Maroons franchise.

The last active Maroons player in the NHL was Toe Blake, who last played in the 1947–48 season as a long time left wing for the Montreal Canadiens.

<text>Lonicera morrowii, the Morrow&#x27;s honeysuckle, is a deciduous honeysuckle in the family Caprifoliaceae, native to Japan, Korea, and Northeast China. It is colloquially called &quot;bush honeysuckle&quot; in the United States, and is considered an invasive species.

== Description ==

It is a shrub, reaching a height of 2–2.5 m, with oblong leaves 4–6 cm long. It leafs out quite early in the spring, and in North America is commonly the first deciduous shrub with foliage in March. The flowers are white to pale yellow, and the fruit is a dark red berry 7–8 mm diameter containing numerous seeds. The berries, while eaten frequently by birds, are considered poisonous to humans.

== Taxonomy ==
In cultivation, &quot;Lonicera morrowii&quot; has hybridized with other shrubby species of &quot;Lonicera&quot;. Crossed with &quot;L. tatarica&quot;, it forms the invasive hybrid &quot;L.&quot; × &quot;bella&quot;. It can also hybridize with &quot;L. ruprechtiana&quot;.

==As an invasive species==
Morrow&#x27;s honeysuckle is confirmed as a highly invasive species in the northeastern United States. Morrow&#x27;s honeysuckle thrives at the edges of forests, roads, or other natural or man-made barriers, but is not limited to them, and is found in both mature and disturbed forests. In some areas, Morrow&#x27;s honeysuckle is the dominant plant species, especially in areas of disturbed ecological succession. It is suspected that &quot;Lonicera morrowii&quot; is allelopathic, and may capitalize on disturbed ecological succession by establishing itself and then preventing the growth of plants underneath it. With a sufficiently established thicket of honeysuckle, even other shade-tolerant, invasive species, such as Fortune&#x27;s spindle have difficulty growing underneath it, whether due to its suspected allelopathic activity or through soil depletion.

===Effects on flora and fauna===

Due to its early leafing, Morrow&#x27;s honeysuckle is particularly harmful to spring ephemerals, flowers that evolved to bloom briefly in the spring before other plants leafed out.

Many cedar waxwings&#x27; wax spots in the eastern United States have taken on an unusual orange hue in the last 35 years, a phenomenon that has been attributed to &quot;Lonicera morrowii&quot;. The chemical involved in this color change is rhodoxanthin, a red dye found in the berries of Morrow&#x27;s honeysuckle.

<doc id="240011" wikidata="Q193147" url="?curid=240011" title="Coherence (physics)">
<text>Coherence expresses the potential for two waves to interfere. Two monochromatic beams from a single source always interfere. Wave sources are not strictly monochromatic: they may be &quot;partly coherent&quot;. Beams from different sources are mutually &quot;incoherent&quot;.

When interfering, two waves add together to create a wave of greater amplitude than either one (constructive interference) or subtract from each other to create a wave of minima which may be zero (destructive interference), depending on their relative phase. Constructive or destructive interference are limit cases, and two waves always interfere, even if the result of the addition is complicated or not remarkable.

Two waves with constant relative phase will be coherent. The amount of coherence can readily be measured by the interference visibility, which looks at the size of the interference fringes relative to the input waves (as the phase offset is varied); a precise mathematical definition of the degree of coherence is given by means of correlation functions. More broadly, coherence describes the statistical similarity of a field, such as an electromagnetic field or quantum wave packet, at different points in space or time.

== Qualitative concept ==

Coherence controls the visibility or contrast of interference patterns. For example, visibility of the double slit experiment pattern requires that both slits be illuminated by a coherent wave as illustrated in the figure. Large sources without collimation or sources that mix many different frequencies will have lower visibility.

Coherence contains several distinct concepts. &quot;Spatial coherence&quot; describes the correlation (or predictable relationship) between waves at different points in space, either lateral or longitudinal. &quot;Temporal coherence&quot; describes the correlation between waves observed at different moments in time. Both are observed in the Michelson–Morley experiment and Young&#x27;s interference experiment. Once the fringes are obtained in the Michelson interferometer, when one of the mirrors is moved away gradually from the beam-splitter, the time for the beam to travel increases and the fringes become dull and finally disappear, showing temporal coherence. Similarly, in a double-slit experiment, if the space between the two slits is increased, the coherence dies gradually and finally the fringes disappear, showing spatial coherence. In both cases, the fringe amplitude slowly disappears, as the path difference increases past the coherence length.

Coherence was originally conceived in connection with Thomas Young&#x27;s double-slit experiment in optics but is now used in any field that involves waves, such as acoustics, electrical engineering, neuroscience, and quantum mechanics. The property of coherence is the basis for commercial applications such as holography, the Sagnac gyroscope, radio antenna arrays, optical coherence tomography and telescope interferometers (Astronomical optical interferometers and radio telescopes).

== Mathematical definition ==
The &quot;coherence function&quot; between two signals formula_1 and formula_2 is defined as

:formula_3

where formula_4 is the cross-spectral density of the signal and formula_5 and formula_6 are the power spectral density functions of formula_1 and formula_2, respectively. The cross-spectral density and the power spectral density are defined as the Fourier transforms of the cross-correlation and the autocorrelation signals, respectively. For instance, if the signals are functions of time, the cross-correlation is a measure of the similarity of the two signals as a function of the time lag relative to each other and the autocorrelation is a measure of the similarity of each signal with itself in different instants of time. In this case the coherence is a function of frequency. Analogously, if formula_1 and formula_2 are functions of space, the cross-correlation measures the similarity of two signals in different points in space and the autocorrelations the similarity of the signal relative to itself for a certain separation distance. In that case, coherence is a function of wavenumber (spatial frequency).

The coherence varies in the interval formula_11. If formula_12 it means that the signals are perfectly correlated or linearly related and if formula_13 they are totally uncorrelated. If a linear system is being measured, formula_1 being the input and formula_2 the output, the coherence function will be unitary all over the spectrum. However, if non-linearities are present in the system the coherence will vary in the limit given above.

== Coherence and correlation ==
The coherence of two waves expresses how well correlated the waves are as quantified by the cross-correlation function. Cross-correlation quantifies the ability to predict the phase of the second wave by knowing the phase of the first. As an example, consider two waves perfectly correlated for all times (by using a monochromatic light source). At any time, the phase difference between the two waves will be constant. If, when they are combined, they exhibit perfect constructive interference, perfect destructive interference, or something in-between but with constant phase difference, then it follows that they are perfectly coherent. As will be discussed below, the second wave need not be a separate entity. It could be the first wave at a different time or position. In this case, the measure of correlation is the autocorrelation function (sometimes called &quot;self-coherence&quot;). Degree of correlation involves correlation functions.

== Examples of wave-like states ==
These states are unified by the fact that their behavior is described by a wave equation or some generalization thereof.
*Waves in a rope (up and down) or slinky (compression and expansion)
*Surface waves in a liquid
*Electromagnetic signals (fields) in transmission lines
*Sound
*Radio waves and microwaves
*Light waves (optics)
*Matter waves associated with, for examples, electrons and atoms

In system with macroscopic waves, one can measure the wave directly. Consequently, its correlation with another wave can simply be calculated. However, in optics one cannot measure the electric field directly as it oscillates much faster than any detector&#x27;s time resolution. Instead, one measures the intensity of the light. Most of the concepts involving coherence which will be introduced below were developed in the field of optics and then used in other fields. Therefore, many of the standard measurements of coherence are indirect measurements, even in fields where the wave can be measured directly.

==Temporal coherence==

Temporal coherence is the measure of the average correlation between the value of a wave and itself delayed by formula_16, at any pair of times. Temporal coherence tells us how monochromatic a source is. In other words, it characterizes how well a wave can interfere with itself at a different time. The delay over which the phase or amplitude wanders by a significant amount (and hence the correlation decreases by significant amount) is defined as the coherence time formula_17. At a delay of formula_18 the degree of coherence is perfect, whereas it drops significantly as the delay passes formula_19. The coherence length formula_20 is defined as the distance the wave travels in time formula_17.

The coherence time is not the time duration of the signal; the coherence length differs from the coherence area (see below).

=== The relationship between coherence time and bandwidth ===
The larger the bandwidth – range of frequencies Δf a wave contains – the faster the wave decorrelates (and hence the smaller formula_17 is):

:formula_23

Formally, this follows from the convolution theorem in mathematics, which relates the Fourier transform of the power spectrum (the intensity of each frequency) to its autocorrelation.

Narrow bandwidth lasers have long coherence lengths (up to hundreds of meters). For example, a stabilized and monomode helium–neon laser can easily produce light with coherence lengths of 300 m. Not all lasers have a high monochromaticity, however (e.g. for a mode-locked Ti-sapphire laser, Δλ ≈ 2 nm – 70 nm).

LEDs are characterized by Δλ ≈ 50 nm, and tungsten filament lights exhibit Δλ ≈ 600 nm, so these sources have shorter coherence times than the most monochromatic lasers.

=== Examples of temporal coherence ===
Examples of temporal coherence include:
*A wave containing only a single frequency (monochromatic) is perfectly correlated with itself at all time delays, in accordance with the above relation. (See Figure 1)
*Conversely, a wave whose phase drifts quickly will have a short coherence time. (See Figure 2)
*Similarly, pulses (wave packets) of waves, which naturally have a broad range of frequencies, also have a short coherence time since the amplitude of the wave changes quickly. (See Figure 3)
*Finally, white light, which has a very broad range of frequencies, is a wave which varies quickly in both amplitude and phase. Since it consequently has a very short coherence time (just 10 periods or so), it is often called incoherent.

Holography requires light with a long coherence time. In contrast, optical coherence tomography, in its classical version, uses light with a short coherence time.

=== Measurement of temporal coherence ===

In optics, temporal coherence is measured in an interferometer such as the Michelson interferometer or Mach–Zehnder interferometer. In these devices, a wave is combined with a copy of itself that is delayed by time formula_16. A detector measures the time-averaged intensity of the light exiting the interferometer. The resulting visibility of the interference pattern (e.g. see Figure 4) gives the temporal coherence at delay formula_16. Since for most natural light sources, the coherence time is much shorter than the time resolution of any detector, the detector itself does the time averaging. Consider the example shown in Figure 3. At a fixed delay, here formula_26, an infinitely fast detector would measure an intensity that fluctuates significantly over a time &quot;t&quot; equal to formula_16. In this case, to find the temporal coherence at formula_28, one would manually time-average the intensity.
==Spatial coherence==
In some systems, such as water waves or optics, wave-like states can extend over one or two dimensions. Spatial coherence describes the ability for two spatial points &quot;x1&quot; and &quot;x2&quot; in the extent of a wave to interfere when averaged over time. More precisely, the spatial coherence is the cross-correlation between two points in a wave for all times. If a wave has only 1 value of amplitude over an infinite length, it is perfectly spatially coherent. The range of separation between the two points over which there is significant interference defines the diameter of the coherence area, formula_29 (Coherence length formula_30, often a feature of a source, is usually an industrial term related to the coherence time of the source, not the coherence area in the medium).
formula_29 is the relevant type of coherence for the Young&#x27;s double-slit interferometer. It is also used in optical imaging systems and particularly in various types of astronomy telescopes.

formula_34

Sometimes people also use &quot;spatial coherence&quot; to refer to the visibility when a wave-like state is combined with a spatially shifted copy of itself.

=== Examples ===
Consider a tungsten light-bulb filament. Different points in the filament emit light independently and have no fixed phase-relationship. In detail, at any point in time the profile of the emitted light is going to be distorted. The profile will change randomly over the coherence time formula_35. Since for a white-light source such as a light-bulb formula_35 is small, the filament is considered a spatially incoherent source. In contrast, a radio antenna array, has large spatial coherence because antennas at opposite ends of the array emit with a fixed phase-relationship. Light waves produced by a laser often have high temporal and spatial coherence (though the degree of coherence depends strongly on the exact properties of the laser). Spatial coherence of laser beams also manifests itself as speckle patterns and diffraction fringes seen at the edges of shadow.

Holography requires temporally and spatially coherent light. Its inventor, Dennis Gabor, produced successful holograms more than ten years before lasers were invented. To produce coherent light he passed the monochromatic light from an emission line of a mercury-vapor lamp through a pinhole spatial filter.

In February 2011 it was reported that helium atoms, cooled to near absolute zero / Bose–Einstein condensate state, can be made to flow and behave as a coherent beam as occurs in a laser. In the guided systems, the partial and full incoherence could be studied in terms of Gaussian shell model. Moreover, the coherence properties of the output light from multimode nonlinear optical structures were found to obey the optical thermodynamic theory.

== Spectral coherence of short pulses ==

Waves of different frequencies (in light these are different colours) can interfere to form a pulse if they have a fixed relative phase-relationship (see Fourier transform). Conversely, if waves of different frequencies are not coherent, then, when combined, they create a wave that is continuous in time (e.g. white light or white noise). The temporal duration of the pulse formula_37 is limited by the spectral bandwidth of the light formula_38 according to:

:formula_39,

which follows from the properties of the Fourier transform and results in Küpfmüller&#x27;s uncertainty principle (for quantum particles it also results in the Heisenberg uncertainty principle).

If the phase depends linearly on the frequency (i.e. formula_40) then the pulse will have the minimum time duration for its bandwidth (a &quot;transform-limited&quot; pulse), otherwise it is chirped (see dispersion).

=== Measurement of spectral coherence ===
Measurement of the spectral coherence of light requires a nonlinear optical interferometer, such as an intensity optical correlator, frequency-resolved optical gating (FROG), or spectral phase interferometry for direct electric-field reconstruction (SPIDER).
== Polarization and coherence ==
Light also has a polarization, which is the direction in which the electric or magnetic field oscillates. Unpolarized light is composed of incoherent light waves with random polarization angles. The electric field of the unpolarized light wanders in every direction and changes in phase over the coherence time of the two light waves. An absorbing polarizer rotated to any angle will always transmit half the incident intensity when averaged over time.

If the electric field wanders by a smaller amount the light will be partially polarized so that at some angle, the polarizer will transmit more than half the intensity. If a wave is combined with an orthogonally polarized copy of itself delayed by less than the coherence time, partially polarized light is created.

The polarization of a light beam is represented by a vector in the Poincaré sphere. For polarized light the end of the vector lies on the surface of the sphere, whereas the vector has zero length for unpolarized light. The vector for partially polarized light lies within the sphere.

==Quantum coherence==

The signature property of quantum matter waves, wave interference, relies on coherence. While initially patterned after optical coherence, the theory and experimental understanding of quantum coherence greatly expanded the topic.

=== Matter wave coherence ===
The simplest extension of optical coherence applies optical concepts to matter waves. For example, when performing the double-slit experiment with atoms instead of light waves, a sufficiently collimated atomic beam creates a coherent atomic wave-function illuminating both slits. Each slit acts as a separate but in-phase beam contributing to the intensity pattern on a screen. These two contributions give rise to an intensity pattern of bright bands due to constructive interference, interlaced with dark bands due to destructive interference, on a downstream screen. Many variations of this experiment have been demonstrated.

As with light, transverse coherence (across the direction of propagation) of matter waves is controlled by collimation. Because light, at all frequencies, travels the same velocity, longitudinal and temporal coherence are linked; in matter waves these are independent. In matter waves, velocity (energy) selection controls longitudinal coherence and pulsing or chopping controls temporal coherence.

=== Quantum optics ===
The discovery of the Hanbury Brown and Twiss effect – correlation of light upon coincidence – triggered Glauber&#x27;s creation of uniquely quantum coherence analysis. Classical optical coherence becomes a classical limit for first-order quantum coherence; higher degree of coherence leads to many phenomena in quantum optics.

=== Macroscopic quantum coherence ===
Macroscopic scale quantum coherence leads to novel phenomena, the so-called macroscopic quantum phenomena. For instance, the laser, superconductivity and superfluidity are examples of highly coherent quantum systems whose effects are evident at the macroscopic scale. The macroscopic quantum coherence (off-diagonal long-range order, ODLRO) for superfluidity, and laser light, is related to first-order (1-body) coherence/ODLRO, while superconductivity is related to second-order coherence/ODLRO. (For fermions, such as electrons, only even orders of coherence/ODLRO are possible.) For bosons, a Bose–Einstein condensate is an example of a system exhibiting macroscopic quantum coherence through a multiple occupied single-particle state.

The classical electromagnetic field exhibits macroscopic quantum coherence. The most obvious example is the carrier signal for radio and TV. They satisfy Glauber&#x27;s quantum description of coherence.

=== Quantum coherence as a resource ===
Recently M. B. Plenio and co-workers constructed an operational formulation of quantum coherence as a resource theory. They introduced coherence monotones analogous to the entanglement monotones. Quantum coherence has been shown to be equivalent to quantum entanglement in the sense that coherence can be faithfully described as entanglement, and conversely that each entanglement measure corresponds to a coherence measure.

== Applications ==

=== Holography ===
Coherent superpositions of &quot;optical wave fields&quot; include holography. Holographic photographs have been used as art and as difficult to forge security labels.

=== Non-optical wave fields ===
Further applications concern the coherent superposition of &quot;non-optical wave fields&quot;. In quantum mechanics for example one considers a probability field, which is related to the wave function formula_41 (interpretation: density of the probability amplitude). Here the applications concern, among others, the future technologies of quantum computing and the already available technology of quantum cryptography. Additionally the problems of the following subchapter are treated.

=== Modal analysis ===
Coherence is used to check the quality of the transfer functions (FRFs) being measured. Low coherence can be caused by poor signal to noise ratio, and/or inadequate frequency resolution.

<text>Tampere University of Technology (TUT) () was Finland&#x27;s second-largest university in engineering sciences. The university was located in Hervanta, a suburb of Tampere. It was merged with the University of Tampere to create the new Tampere University on 1 January 2019.

The university&#x27;s statutory duty was to pursue research and give the highest education in its field. The research, conducted by some 1,800 staff and faculty members, mostly focused on applied science and often has close ties to many different companies (such as Nokia). Located next to the university campus is a Technology Centre Hermia, including a large Nokia research facility. TUT was one of the only two Finnish universities which operate as foundation. The yearly budget of the university was some 147 million euros. Close to 50% of its budget was external funding. According to Times Higher Education, it ranked 11th in the world, and 4th in Europe, for industry collaboration.

== History ==

From the late 19th century, Tampere had been the most important industrial center in Finland. The Technical Institute of Tampere had provided engineers for its industries since 1911, but all higher technological education in Finland took place in Helsinki University of Technology. In the 1950s, the city of Tampere started actively remedying the situation, first founding a municipal science library in 1955. This library formed the core for the libraries of the TUT and the medical faculty of the University of Tampere In 1960, city succeeded in persuading the small private university &quot;Yhteiskunnallinen korkeakoulu&quot; to move to Tampere from Helsinki. A few years later, this university changed its name to University of Tampere.

The founding of the Tampere University of Technology was one of the steps of the city and the local business life in bringing higher education to the region. The university was founded in 1965 as a branch of Helsinki University of Technology and became an independent university status in 1972. The Student Union of Tampere University of Technology (&quot;Tampereen teknillisen yliopiston ylioppilaskunta, TTYY&quot;) was also established alongside the university.

In 2003, the university changed its Finnish name from TTKK (&quot;Tampereen teknillinen korkeakoulu&quot;) to TTY (&quot;Tampereen teknillinen yliopisto&quot;) so that the Finnish name would be closer to the English name and to distinguish itself from polytechnics that are not universities in the meaning of the Humboldtian university ideal or in the meaning of the Finnish law.

As a part of the Finnish university reform, Tampere University of Technology chose to become one of the two Finnish universities operating as foundations in the beginning of 2010. The university hopes that compared to the previous form of state agency, the foundation form gives it more operational freedom.

A programme, called Tampere3, to merge the university with University of Tampere and Tampere University of Applied Sciences was started in the spring of 2014. The merger was approved by Parliament in December 2017 and came into effect on 1 January 2019. The new foundation-based interdisciplinary higher education institution is named Tampere University. The new university will comprise 35,000 students and 5,000 employees, thus, being the second largest university in Finland.

==Faculties==
Tampere University of Technology comprises five faculties:
*Faculty of Biomedical Sciences and Engineering:

==Research==
Tampere University of Technology is primarily a research university, which specializes in technology and architecture. While all departments pursue scientific research and publish in international, peer-reviewed journals, the strongest areas of the university are signal processing, nanophotonics, biotechnology, and intelligent mobile hydraulic systems. The university has one Finnish Center of Excellence, the Signal Processing Laboratory. In addition, it participates in two other Finnish Centers of Excellence. Among other things, the university has been developing the world&#x27;s first: biodegradable joint implant, communicator, yellow laser and walking harvester.

In 2014, the researchers of TUT published 1586 papers in peer-reviewed international publications, meaning an average of a more than one article per researcher. The university has 133 full professors, 193 tenured lecturers, and 754 researchers, of which 22% are international employees.

Tampere University of Technology has been selected three times as one of the best universities under 50 years old by Times Higher Education and QS World University Rankings has ranked it twice among the best 50 young universities in the World.

===Research assessment 2011===

An international independent team made an assessment of research quality in TUT in 2011. The Assessment Scale was: Outstanding International Level (5), Very Good International Level (4), Good International Level (3), Fair International Level (2), and Poor International Level (1). When comparing the results between different faculties, the results are not comparable as the assessment was done by different group of people for different faculties. Intra-faculty comparisons however can be done based on the results. Furthermore, the numerical evaluations were accompanied with the verbal assessments, which give better understanding than the plain integer numbers. Overall, the results were mostly in the range of Very Good and Good International Level.

===HR excellence in research===

In recognition of development activities related to research careers and the position of researchers at the University, the European Commission awarded Tampere University of Technology the right to use the HR Excellence in Research logo in spring 2014.

The logo demonstrates that the working conditions and career opportunities of research staff at TUT comply with recommendations given by the European Commission in The European Charter for Researchers and The Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers. The Charter &amp; Code aim to give equal rights and obligations to individual researchers throughout Europe, therefore improving mobility and working conditions as well as reinforcing research and development across Europe.

==Education==

===Undergraduate degree programs===

The university awards undergraduate degrees of &quot;tekniikan kandidaatti&quot; (Bachelor of Science in Technology (B.Sc. Tech.) or Architecture (B.Sc. Arch.), &quot;diplomi-insinööri&quot; (Master of Science in Technology (M.Sc. Tech.), and &quot;arkkitehti&quot; (M.Sc. Arch.). The recommended time for the completion of master&#x27;s degree is five years (3 for B.Sc. and 2 for M.Sc.) to complete. In practice, the students use little bit less than seven years for their studies, on average. However, this average includes the compulsory military service of 6–12 months that most of the male students (76% of the student body) complete before graduation. Yearly, some 800–850 masters graduate from TUT.

Studies leading up to a M.Sc. available in the Finnish language are:
*Architecture
*Automation Engineering
*Biotechnology
*Civil Engineering
*Electrical Engineering
*Environmental and Energy Technology
*Industrial Engineering and Management
*Information and Knowledge Management
*Information Technology
*Materials Engineering
*Fibre and Textile Engineering
*Mechanical Engineering
*Science and Engineering
*Mathematical Sciences Subject Teacher Education

===International undergraduate degree programs===
In August 2016 the first completely English taught B.Sc. program in the field of engineering in Finland started at TUT. The program of Science and Engineering aims to provide students a multi-disciplinary basic knowledge on different engineering and scientific subjects and offer a wide range of possibilities to continue studies in TUT&#x27;s master&#x27;s degree programs in English. Possible major subjects are Mathematics, Physics, and Information and Communications Technology.

Apart from the programs in the Finnish language, these M.Sc. programs are available in English:
*Sustainable Architecture
*Bioengineering
*Automation Engineering
*Electrical Engineering
*Industrial Engineering and Management
*Information Technology
*Materials Science
*Science and Engineering

===Post-Graduate degree programs===
All programs leading to M.Sc. also offer the possibility of continuing research until a doctoral degree. As usual in Finland, the completion of doctoral degree requires a certain number of courses taught (worth at least 60 ECTS) and a dissertation containing original scientific research, usually published in international peer-reviewed journals. Depending on the prior education of the student, the doctoral degree is either &quot;tekniikan tohtori&quot; (Doctor of Science in Technology or Architecture) or &quot;filosofian tohtori&quot; (Doctor of Philosophy). As a general rule, the graduate students with a master&#x27;s degree in Technology or Architecture will be awarded the Doctor of Science degree, while graduate students with a master&#x27;s degree in other majors will be awarded the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. A &quot;tekniikan lisensiaatti&quot; (Licentiate of Technology) is also available. Yearly, some 70 doctors graduate. The mean age of new doctors is 34.

==Student life==
Student life at Tampere is especially vivid as three universities are located at the area. The students of technology (teekkarit) are especially noticeable, as they wear a distinctive hat with a tuft (teekkarilakki) on many occasions, both formal and informal. These student caps with a tuft are shared by every university in Finland that educates students of technology but the caps are slightly visually different in every university. Students of technology are also famous for student pranks (Finnish: jäynä), similar in principle to MIT hacks.

All undergraduate students are members of the Student Union of Tampere University of Technology. Post-graduate students are given the option of joining. In addition to the student union, students join numerous associations for studies, cultural activity, and sports. Each of the 14 guilds at TUT serve the students in their respective study program and has their uniquely coloured student boilersuit. There are also numerous other clubs that focus on different hobbies, such as, eSports, alpine skiing, sailing, photographing and skydiving.

More notable leisure clubs:
* Remmi-Team – Eco-marathon vehicles club 
** 26 Finnish championships,
** 81 podium positions in different categories, and
** 12 victories in international student-classes.
* Castor – Space club 
** Supikoira Rocket: First model rocket in Finland to climb up to altitude.
** Itikka Project: First Finnish images from Space.
* Tampere Academic Symphony Orchestra ()

International clubs:
*AIESEC
*International Association for the Exchange of Students for Technical Experience
*Electrical Engineering Students&#x27; European Association

<doc id="240017" wikidata="Q313482" url="?curid=240017" title="Stephen Covey">
<text>Stephen Richards Covey (October 24, 1932 – July 16, 2012) was an American educator, author, businessman, and speaker. His most popular book is &quot;of Highly Effective People&quot;. His other books include &quot;First Things First&quot;, &quot;Principle-Centered Leadership&quot;, &quot;The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Families&quot;, , and &quot;The Leader In Me: How Schools and Parents Around the World Are Inspiring Greatness, One Child at a Time&quot;. In 1996, &quot;Time&quot; magazine named him one of the 25 most influential people. He was a professor at the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business at Utah State University (USU) at the time of his death.

==Early life and education==
Covey was born to Stephen Glenn Covey and Irene Louise Richards Covey in Salt Lake City, Utah, on October 24, 1932. Louise was the daughter of Stephen L Richards, an apostle and counselor in the First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) to David O. McKay. Covey was the grandson of Stephen Mack Covey who founded the original Little America Wyoming near Granger, Wyoming. He was athletic as a youth but suffered from a slipped capital femoral epiphysis in junior high school, requiring him to change his focus to academics and a member of the debate team and graduated from high school early.

Covey earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in business administration from the University of Utah, an MBA from the Harvard Business School (HBS), and a Doctor of Religious Education from Brigham Young University (BYU). He was a member of Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. He was awarded ten honorary doctorates.

==Philosophical background==
Covey was heavily influenced by Peter Drucker and Carl Rogers. Another key influence on his thinking was his study of American self-help books that he did for his doctoral dissertation. A further influence on Covey was his affiliation with the LDS Church. According to Clayton Christensen, The Seven Habits was a secular distillation of Latter-day Saint values.

==Books==
Covey&#x27;s book &quot;Spiritual Roots of Human Relations&quot; was published in 1970 by Deseret Book Company. Reading this book will identify how Covey&#x27;s later works were a secular development of these earlier ideas.

===&quot;The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People&quot;===

&quot;The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People&quot;, Covey&#x27;s best-known book, has sold more than 20 million copies worldwide since its first publication in 1989. The audio version became the first non-fiction audio-book in U.S. publishing history to sell more than one million copies. Covey argues against what he calls &quot;The Personality Ethic&quot;, something he sees as prevalent in many modern self-help books. He promotes what he labels &quot;The Character Ethic&quot;: aligning one&#x27;s values with so-called &quot;universal and timeless&quot; principles. Covey adamantly refuses to conflate principles and values; he sees principles as external natural laws, while values remain internal and subjective. Covey proclaims that values govern people&#x27;s behavior, but principles ultimately determine the consequences. Covey presents his teachings in a series of habits, manifesting as a progression from dependence via independence to interdependence.

===&quot;The 8th Habit&quot;===
Covey&#x27;s 2004 book &quot;The 8th Habit: From Effectiveness to Greatness&quot; was published by Free Press, an imprint of Simon &amp; Schuster. It is the sequel to &quot;The 7 Habits&quot;. Covey posits that effectiveness does not suffice in what he calls &quot;The Knowledge Worker Age&quot;. He says that &quot;the challenges and complexity we face today are of a different order of magnitude.&quot; The 8th habit essentially urges: &quot;Find your voice and inspire others to find theirs.&quot;

===&quot;The Leader in Me&quot;===
Covey released &quot;The Leader in Me: How Schools and Parents Around the World Are Inspiring Greatness, One Child at a Time&quot; in November 2008. It tells how &quot;some schools, parents and business leaders are preparing the next generation to meet the great challenges and opportunities of the 21st Century. It shows how an elementary school in Raleigh, North Carolina, decided to try incorporating &quot;The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People&quot; and other basic leadership skills into the curriculum in unique and creative ways. Inspired by the success of Principal Muriel Summers and the teachers and staff of A.B. Combs Elementary School in Raleigh, other schools and parents around the world have adopted the approach and have seen remarkable results&quot;.

==Other projects==

===Academia===
Covey was a professor at the Marriott School of Management at BYU for several years, helping to establish the Master of Organizational Behavior program, which has since been merged into the MBA program. While at BYU Covey served as an assistant to the university president.

During the late part of his life, Covey returned to academia as a professor at the Huntsman School of Business at USU, holding the Huntsman Presidential Chair.

===Education===
Covey developed his 2008 book &quot;The Leader in Me&quot; into several education-related projects. On April 20, 2010, he made his first post to an education blog entitled &quot;Our Children and the Crisis in Education&quot; which appears on the &quot;Huffington Post&quot; news and blog-aggregation website. FranklinCovey also established a Web site dedicated exclusively to &quot;The Leader in Me&quot; concept, and it holds periodic conferences and workshops to train elementary school administrators who want to integrate &quot;The Leader in Me&quot; process into their school&#x27;s academic culture.

==Personal==

===Family===
Covey lived with his wife, Sandra Merrill Covey, and their family in Provo, Utah, home to BYU, where Covey taught prior to the publication of his best-selling book. Parents of nine children and grandparents of fifty-five, Stephen Covey received the Fatherhood Award from the National Fatherhood Initiative in 2003.

Covey&#x27;s grandson, Britain, played college football at his alma mater, University of Utah, and signed as an undrafted free agent to the Philadelphia Eagles following the 2022 NFL draft.

===Religion===
Covey was a practicing member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He served a two-year mission in England for the Church. Beginning in July 1962, Covey served as the first president of the church&#x27;s Irish Mission. Starting in 1973, Covey served for a time as a mission representative of the Quorum of the Twelve, where he oversaw training of missionaries in missions in the eastern United States.

When Covey studied as an MBA student at HBS, he would, on occasion, preach to crowds on Boston Common.

Covey authored several devotional works for Latter-day Saint readers, including:
*&quot;Spiritual Roots of Human Relations&quot; (1970)
*&quot;The Divine Center&quot; (1982)
*&quot;Marriage and Family: Gospel Insights&quot; (1983) co-authored with Truman G Madsen
*&quot;6 Events: The Restoration Model for Solving Life&#x27;s Problems&quot; (2004).

==Injuries and death==
In April 2012, Covey was riding a bike in Rock Canyon Park in Provo, Utah, when he lost control and fell. He was wearing a helmet but according to his daughter, the helmet slipped and his head hit the pavement. She said Covey &quot;went down a hill too fast and flipped forward on the bike. It was a pretty big goose egg on the top of his head.&quot; Covey also suffered cracked ribs and a partially collapsed lung.

Covey died from complications resulting from the bike accident at the Eastern Idaho Regional Medical Center in Idaho Falls, Idaho, on July 16, 2012, at the age of 79.

<doc id="240018" wikidata="Q84238" url="?curid=240018" title="Peter Drucker">
<text>Peter Ferdinand Drucker (; ; November 19, 1909 – November 11, 2005) was an Austrian American management consultant, educator, and author, whose writings contributed to the philosophical and practical foundations of modern management theory. He was also a leader in the development of management education, and invented the concepts known as management by objectives and self-control, and he has been described as &quot;the champion of management as a serious discipline&quot;.

Drucker&#x27;s books and articles, both scholarly and popular, explored how humans are organized across the business, government, and nonprofit sectors of society. He is one of the best-known and most widely influential thinkers and writers on the subject of management theory and practice. His writings have predicted many of the major developments of the late twentieth century, including privatization and decentralization; the rise of Japan to economic world power; the decisive importance of marketing; and the emergence of the information society with its necessity of lifelong learning. In 1959, Drucker coined the term &quot;knowledge worker&quot;, and later in his life considered knowledge-worker productivity to be the next frontier of management.

==Biography==
Drucker grew up in what he referred to as a &quot;liberal&quot; Lutheran Protestant household in Austria-Hungary. His mother Caroline Bondi had studied medicine and his father Adolf Drucker was a lawyer and high-level civil servant. Drucker was born in Vienna, Austria, in the 19th district of Vienna-Döbling. He grew up in a home where intellectuals, high government officials, and scientists would meet to discuss new ideas. These included Joseph Schumpeter, Friedrich Hayek and Ludwig von Mises. Hans Kelsen was his uncle.

After graduating from Döbling Gymnasium in 1927, Drucker found few opportunities for employment in post-World War I Vienna, so he moved to Hamburg, Germany, first working as an apprentice at an established cotton trading company, then as a journalist, writing for &quot;Der Österreichische Volkswirt&quot; (&quot;The Austrian Economist&quot;). Drucker then moved to Frankfurt, where he took a job at the Daily &quot;Frankfurter General-Anzeiger&quot;. While in Frankfurt, he also earned a doctorate in international law and public law from the Goethe University Frankfurt in 1931.

In 1933, Drucker left Germany for England. In London, he worked as a security analyst for an insurance company, then as the chief economist at a private bank. While in London, Drucker regularly attended John Maynard Keynes seminars at Cambridge University, discovering that he was interested in &quot;the behavior of people&quot; while Keynes and other students focused on &quot;the behavior of commodities.&quot; 

In 1937, Peter Drucker married Doris Schmitz, a classmate from the University of Frankfurt. The Druckers then moved to the U.S., where Peter Drucker became a freelance journalist writing for &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. In 1939, Drucker joined Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville, New York as a part-time economics instructor. Drucker was fired in 1941 after refusing to sign a faculty manifesto that he said &quot;viciously and falsely attacked the liberal president of Brooklyn College, Harry Gideonse,&quot; who had supported the UK against Nazi Germany in the Battle of Britain. His 1939 book, &quot;The End of Economic Man&quot;, attracted attention of Bennington College president Lewis Webster Jones, who invited Drucker to lecture on the book. Despite some faculty objections, Jones hired Drucker as a professor of politics and philosophy at Bennington, a position Drucker would hold from 1942 to 1949. With the U.S. engaged in World War II, Drucker also became a consultant on international economic policy to the Board of Economic Warfare. In 1943, Drucker became a naturalized citizen of the United States. 

Then from 1950 to 1971, Drucker was a professor of management at New York University. In 1954, Drucker to wrote &quot;The Practice of Management&quot;, a book he set out to write after finding a lack of books specifically about business management at the General Electric library in Crotonville, New York. The &quot;Saturday Review&quot; and &quot;Business Week&quot; praised &quot;The Practice of Management&quot; as groundbreaking.

Drucker went to California in 1971, where he developed one of the country&#x27;s first executive MBA programs for working professionals at Claremont Graduate University (then known as Claremont Graduate School). From 1971 until his death, he was the Clarke Professor of Social Science and Management at Claremont. Claremont Graduate University&#x27;s management school was named the Peter F. Drucker Graduate School of Management in his honor in 1987 (later renamed the Peter F. Drucker and Masatoshi Ito Graduate School of Management). He established the Drucker Archives at Claremont Graduate University in 1999; the Archives became the Drucker Institute in 2006. Drucker taught his last class in 2002 at age 92. He continued to act as a consultant to businesses and nonprofit organizations well into his nineties.

==Work and philosophy==

===Early influences===
Among Drucker&#x27;s early influences was the Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter, a friend of his father&#x27;s, who impressed upon Drucker the idea of the importance of innovation and entrepreneurship. Drucker was also influenced, in a much different way, by John Maynard Keynes, whom he heard lecture in 1934 in Cambridge. &quot;I suddenly realized that Keynes and all the brilliant economic students in the room were interested in the behavior of commodities&quot;, Drucker wrote, &quot;while I was interested in the behavior of people&quot;.

Over the next 70 years, Drucker&#x27;s writings would be marked by a focus on relationships among human beings, as opposed to the crunching of numbers. His books were filled with lessons on how organizations can bring out the best in people, and how workers can find a sense of community and dignity in a modern society organized around large institutions. As a business consultant, Drucker disliked the term &quot;guru&quot;, though it was often applied to him; &quot;I have been saying for many years&quot;, Drucker once remarked, &quot;that we are using the word &#x27;guru&#x27; only because &#x27;charlatan&#x27; is too long to fit into a headline.&quot;

As a young writer, Drucker wrote two pieces – one on the conservative German philosopher Friedrich Julius Stahl and another called &quot;The Jewish Question in Germany&quot; – that were burned and banned by the Nazis. In 1939 he published a contemporary analysis of the rise of fascism called &quot;The End of Economic Man&quot;. This was his first book, published in New York, in English. In the introduction he refers to &quot;The Jewish Question in Germany&quot; saying &quot;An early excerpt [of this book] was published as a pamphlet by an Austrian Catholic and Anti-Nazi in ... 1936&quot;.

===The &quot;business thinker&quot;===
Drucker&#x27;s career as a business thinker took off in 1942, when his initial writings on politics and society won him access to the internal workings of General Motors (GM), one of the largest companies in the world at that time. His experiences in Europe had left him fascinated with the problem of authority. He shared his fascination with Donaldson Brown, the mastermind behind the administrative controls at GM. In 1943 Brown invited him in to conduct what might be called a &quot;political audit&quot;: a two-year social-scientific analysis of the corporation. Drucker attended every board meeting, interviewed employees, and analyzed production and decision-making processes.

The resulting book, &quot;Concept of the Corporation&quot;, popularized GM&#x27;s multidivisional structure and led to numerous articles, consulting engagements, and additional books. GM, however, was hardly thrilled with the final product. Drucker had suggested that the auto giant might want to re-examine a host of long-standing policies on customer relations, dealer relations, employee relations and more. Inside the corporation, Drucker&#x27;s counsel was viewed as hypercritical. GM&#x27;s revered chairman, Alfred Sloan, was so upset about the book that he &quot;simply treated it as if it did not exist,&quot; Drucker later recalled, &quot;never mentioning it and never allowing it to be mentioned in his presence.&quot;

Drucker taught that management is &quot;a liberal art&quot;, and he infused his management advice with interdisciplinary lessons from history, sociology, psychology, philosophy, culture and religion. He also believed strongly that all institutions, including those in the private sector, have a responsibility to the whole of society. &quot;The fact is,&quot; Drucker wrote in his 1973 &quot;Management: Tasks, Responsibilities, Practices&quot;, &quot;that in modern society there is no other leadership group but managers. If the managers of our major institutions, and especially of business, do not take responsibility for the common good, no one else can or will.&quot;

Drucker was intrigued by employees who knew more about certain subjects than their bosses or colleagues, and yet had to cooperate with others in a large organization. Rather than simply glorify the phenomenon as the epitome of human progress, Drucker analyzed it, and explained how it challenged the common thinking about how organizations should be run.

His approach worked well in the increasingly mature business world of the second half of the twentieth century. By that time large corporations had developed the basic manufacturing efficiencies and managerial hierarchies of mass production. Executives thought they knew how to run companies, and Drucker took it upon himself to poke holes in their beliefs, lest organizations become stale. But he did so in a sympathetic way. He assumed that his readers were intelligent, rational, hardworking people of goodwill. If their organizations struggled, he believed it was usually because of outdated ideas, a narrow conception of problems, or internal misunderstandings.

Drucker developed an extensive consulting business built around his personal relationship with top management. He became legendary among many of post-war Japan&#x27;s new business leaders trying to rebuild their war-torn homeland. He advised the heads of General Motors, Sears, General Electric, W.R. Grace and IBM, among many others. Over time he offered his management advice to nonprofits like the American Red Cross and the Salvation Army. His advice was eagerly sought by the senior executives of the Adela Investment Company, a private initiative of the world&#x27;s multinational corporations to promote investment in the developing countries of Latin America.

===Writings===
Drucker&#x27;s 39 books have been translated into more than thirty-six languages. Two are novels, and one – &quot;Adventures of a Bystander&quot; (1978) – is an autobiography. He is the co-author of a book on Japanese painting, and made eight series of educational films on management topics. He also penned a regular column in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; for 10 years and contributed frequently to the &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot;, &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, and &quot;The Economist&quot;.

His work is especially popular in Japan, even more so after the publication of &quot;What If the Female Manager of a High-School Baseball Team Read Drucker&#x27;s &quot;Management&quot;&quot;, a novel that features the main character using one of his books to great effect, which was also adapted into an anime and a live action film. His popularity in Japan may be compared with that of his contemporary W. Edwards Deming.

===Key ideas===
* Decentralization and simplification. Drucker discounted the command and control model and asserted that companies work best when they are decentralized. According to Drucker, corporations tend to produce too many products, hire employees they don&#x27;t need (when a better solution would be outsourcing), and expand into economic sectors that they should avoid.
* The prediction of the decline and marginalization of the &quot;blue collar&quot; worker.
* The concept of what eventually came to be known as &quot;outsourcing&quot;. He used the example of &quot;front room&quot; and &quot;back room&quot; of each business: a company should be engaged in only the front room activities that are critical to supporting its core business. Back room activities should be handed over to other companies, for whom these tasks are the front room activities.
* The importance of the nonprofit sector, which he calls the third sector (the private and government sectors being the first two). Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) play crucial roles in the economies of countries around the world.
* A profound skepticism of macroeconomic theory. Drucker contended that economists of all schools fail to explain significant aspects of modern economies.
* A lament that the sole focus of microeconomics is price. Drucker noted that microeconomics fails to show what products actually do for us, thereby stimulating commercial interest in how to calculate what products actually do for us from their price.
*Economic chain costing: the idea that a competitive company needs to know the costs of its entire economic chain, not simply the costs for which it is responsible as an individual business within that chain. &quot;What matters ... is the economic reality, the costs of the entire [production] process, regardless of who owns what.&quot;
*Respect for the worker: Drucker believed that employees are assets, not liabilities. He taught that knowledgeable workers are the essential ingredients of the modern economy, and that a hybrid management model is the sole method of demonstrating an employee&#x27;s value to the organization. Central to this philosophy is the view that people are an organization&#x27;s most valuable resource, and that a manager&#x27;s job is both to prepare people to perform and to give them freedom to do so.
* A belief in what he called &quot;the sickness of government&quot;. Drucker made nonpartisan claims that government is often unable or unwilling to provide new services that people need and/or want, though he believed that this condition is not intrinsic to the form of government. The chapter &quot;The Sickness of Government&quot;, in his book &quot;The Age of Discontinuity&quot;, formed the basis of New Public Management, a theory of public administration that dominated the discipline in the 1980s and 1990s.
* The need for &quot;planned abandonment&quot;. Businesses and governments have a natural human tendency to cling to &quot;yesterday&#x27;s successes&quot; rather than seeing when they are no longer useful.
* A belief that taking action without thinking is the cause of every failure.
* The need for community. Early in his career, Drucker predicted the &quot;end of economic man&quot; and advocated the creation of a &quot;plant community&quot;, where an individual&#x27;s social needs could be met. He later acknowledged that the plant community never materialized, and by the 1980s, suggested that volunteering in the nonprofit sector was the key to fostering a healthy society where people found a sense of belonging and civic pride.
* The need to manage business by balancing a variety of needs and goals, rather than subordinating an institution to a single value. This concept of management by objectives and self-control forms the keynote of his 1954 landmark &quot;The Practice of Management&quot;.
* A company&#x27;s primary responsibility is to serve its customers. Profit is not the primary goal, but rather an essential condition for the company&#x27;s continued existence and sustainability.
* A belief in the notion that great companies could stand among mankind&#x27;s noblest inventions.
* &quot;Do what you do best and outsource the rest&quot; is a business tagline first &quot;coined and developed&quot; in the 1990s by Drucker. The slogan was used primarily to advocate outsourcing as a viable business strategy. Drucker began explaining the concept of outsourcing as early as 1989 in his Wall Street Journal (WSJ) article entitled &quot;Sell the Mailroom.&quot;

== Criticism ==
&quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; researched several of his lectures in 1987 and reported that he was sometimes loose with the facts. Drucker falsely claimed, for example, that the English language was the official language for all employees at Japan&#x27;s Mitsui trading company. Drucker defended himself: &quot;I use anecdotes to make a point, not to write history.&quot;

Also, while Drucker was known for his prescience, he was not always correct in his forecasts. He predicted, for instance, that the United States&#x27; financial center would shift from New York to Washington.

Others maintain that one of Drucker&#x27;s core concepts, &quot;management by objectives,&quot; is flawed and has never really been proven to work effectively. Critic Dale Krueger said that the system is difficult to implement and that companies often wind up overemphasizing control, as opposed to fostering creativity, to meet their goals.

Drucker&#x27;s classic work, &quot;Concept of the Corporation&quot;, criticized General Motors while it was considered the most successful corporation in the world. Many of GM&#x27;s executives considered Drucker for a long time afterward. Although Alfred P. Sloan refrained from personal hostility toward Drucker, he considered Drucker&#x27;s critiques of GM&#x27;s management to be &quot;dead wrong&quot;.

==Awards and honors==
Drucker was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by US President George W. Bush on July 9, 2002. He also received honors from the government of Austria, including the Grand Silver Medal for Services to the Republic of Austria in 1974, the Grand Gold Decoration for Services to the Republic of Austria in 1991 and the Austrian Cross of Honour for Science and Art, 1st class in 1999 and the Order of the Sacred Treasure, 3rd class; June 24, 1966, from the government of Japan.

Drucker was the Honorary Chairman of the &quot;Peter F. Drucker Foundation for Nonprofit Management&quot;, now the &quot;Leader to Leader Institute&quot;, from 1990 through 2002. In 1969 he was awarded New York University&#x27;s highest honor, its Presidential Citation. For his article, &quot;What Makes an Effective Executive&quot;, &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot; honored Drucker in the June 2004 with his seventh McKinsey Award – the most awarded to an individual. Drucker was inducted into the Junior Achievement US Business Hall of Fame in 1996. He received 25 honorary doctorates from American, Belgian, Czech, English, Spanish and Swiss universities. His 1954 book &quot;The Practice of Management&quot; was voted the third most influential management book of the 20th century in a poll of the Fellows of the Academy of Management. In Claremont, California, Eleventh Street between College Avenue and Dartmouth Avenue was renamed &quot;Drucker Way&quot; in October 2009 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Drucker&#x27;s birth.
Drucker was posthumously honored when he was inducted into the Outsourcing Hall of Fame in recognition of his outstanding contributions in the field. In 2018, Drucker was named the world&#x27;s most influential business thinker on the Thinkers50.com list.

== Legacy ==
At Claremont Graduate University, the Peter F. Drucker Graduate Management Center – now the Peter F. Drucker and Masatoshi Ito Graduate School of Management – was established in 1987 and continues to be guided by Drucker&#x27;s principles.

The annual Global Peter Drucker Forum was first held in 2009, the centenary of Drucker&#x27;s birth.

==Personal life==
Peter Drucker married Doris Schmitz in 1937; they had four children. On November 11, 2005, Peter Drucker died of natural causes in Claremont, California, aged 95. Doris died in October 2014 at the age of 103.

<text>Ulrich Ochsenbein (24 November 1811, in Schwarzenegg – 3 November 1890) was a Swiss, jurist, military officer, politician and member of the Swiss Federal Council (1848–1854).

== Early life and education ==
Ulrich Ochsenbein was born on the 24 November 1811 as the second of ten children at Schwarzenegg near Thun. His parents were peasants and had a tavern beside their farm. His father was also a horse merchant and Ochsenbein is described of having been close to his mother. The family Ochsenbein moved to Valais where Ulrich attended school in Granges-Marnard for seven years. His teacher was a French soldier and he learned French language. In 1825 his father lead the tavern at the post office in Nidau, to where also his son moved. In Nidau, Ulrich then also learned the German language. At the Gymnsium in Biel he then learned the old languages and from 1830 onwards studied law at the Academy in Bern. He graduated December 1834 and became a prokurator and in 1841 he became a Fürsprecher. 

==Professional and military career==

From 1835 onwards, he had a law firm together with his brother-in-law Eduard Sury. His law firm was in Nidau, where he also entered the municipal council and served as its president. Between 1839 and 1841 he unsuccessfully represented against the Abbey in St.Urban. 

He served as a Feldwebel in the federal intervention in Basel Country in 1833 and was promoted to Unterleutntant in the artillery in 1834. In 1836 he became Lieutenant and was deployed to the Bernese Jura. Two years later, when France threatened a military intervention if Switzerland refused to extradite Louis Napoleon Bonaparte, he was deployed to the french border but Bonaparte eventually prevented a conflict by his voluntary departure from Swiss territory. Ulrich Ochsenbein was a leader of the unsuccessful second &quot;Freischarenzug&quot; against Lucerne in 1845. Over a hundred people died in the attack and 2000 prisoners were taken by Lucerne. Ochsenbein and Jakob Stämpfli only narrowly managed to escape. Since he was one of the leaders of the campaign against Lucerne, the Tagsatzung expelled him from the General Staff. Following the cantons of Lucerne, Zug, Valais, Schwyz, Fribourg, Uri and Unterwalden created the so-called Sonderbund. In 1847, he led a military force from Bern against the Sonderbund which then was also defeated in the Sonderbund war.

==Political career==
Following the defeat in the &quot;Freischarenzüge,&quot; Ochsenbein was elected into the Grand Council of Bern from Nidau. He soon became Vice-President of the Executive Council and the second deputy for Bern to the Tagsatzung. As he entered the Tagsatzung for the first time in August 1846, still known as the former leader of the rebels, Colonel Theodor Ab Yberg (from the Sonderbund) fiercely opposed him.

He headed the Radicals of Bern (Berner Radikale) together with Jakob Stämpfli. The Radicals later became the Free Democratic Party (FDP). He was a member of the Grand Council in the canton of Bern from 1845 to 1846, president of the Verfassungsrat in 1846 and a member of the Regierungsrat from 1846 to 1848. 1847 to 1848 he represented the canton of Bern at the Tagsatzung (diet) which he presided in 1847. He played an important role that the Swiss constitution was accepted by the Swiss population in the constitutional referendum held on 6 June 1848.

He was elected to the Federal Council of Switzerland on 16 November 1848 as the second Federal Councilor after Jonas Furrer in the history of Switzerland. He handed over office on 31 December 1854. In the so-called Complementary Elections to the National Council in 1854, he had lost to Jakob Stämpfli, who then was preferred for the Federal Council by the National Council. He is one of only a few federal councilors to be voted out of office. During his time as a federal councilor a fight broke out between the conservatives and a group of the radical party. Not willing to take positions, he lost the trust of both sides. During his time in office he held the Military Department (department of defence). 

== In France ==

After he resigned from politics in Switzerland, he first considered an emigration to America but then became a military officer in France where he served as a Brigadier General in the German-French war. That he served as a former head of the Military Department in Switzerland in the foreign services was also noted in Switzerland. He was for quite some while forgotten by the political elite and only in recent years and with a biography published in 2009, he was sort of rehabilitated.

== Later years ==
He returned to Nidau after his military service in France, and following opposed the educational politics of the Federal Councilor Karl Schenk or the Bernese railway politics which did not make him more popular. He died in Nidau in November 1890.

<doc id="240025" wikidata="Q123823" url="?curid=240025" title="Joseph Deiss">
<text>Joseph Deiss (born 18 January 1946) is a Swiss economist and politician who served as a Member of the Swiss Federal Council from 1999 to 2006. A member of the Christian Democratic People&#x27;s Party (CVP/PDC), he first headed the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (1999–2002) before transferring to the Federal Department of Economic Affairs (2003–2006). Deiss was elected President of the United Nations General Assembly for its 65th session in 2010.

== Political career ==
=== Legislative and local experience ===

Joseph Deiss started his political career in 1981 as a representative of his party in the Grand Council of Fribourg. In 1991 he became the president of the cantonal parliament for one year. Between 1982 and 1996 Deiss assumed the mayorship of his home village Barberêche.

In 1991 he was elected to the National Council. From 1995 to 1996 Deiss was vice president of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National Council. In 1996 he was made president of the committee in charge of the total revision of the Swiss Federal Constitution.

=== In the Federal Council ===

Deiss was elected to the Swiss Federal Council on 11 March 1999, along with his erstwhile colleague Ruth Metzler. Together with Adalbert Durrer and Remigio Ratti, he was one of three official candidates proposed by the CVP/PDC for the seat of retiring Federal Councillor Flavio Cotti. However, the election became a narrow contest between Deiss and Peter Hess, who was favoured by many conservative representatives. Deiss eventually won after the sixth ballot, by 120 to 119 votes.

In office, he has headed the following departments:
*Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (1999–2002)
*Federal Department of Economic Affairs (2003-2006)

After the failure of Ruth Metzler to be re-elected in 2003, Metzler challenged him for his seat, but lost by 138 votes to 96. He was subsequently elected President of the Confederation for 2004, one year earlier than would have been regular. He became the only remaining representative of the CVP in the Council.

On 27 April 2006 Deiss rather unexpectedly resigned as Federal Councillor. The CVP&#x27;s seat not being contested by the other parties, he was succeeded by the president of the CVP, Doris Leuthard, who took over from Deiss on 1 August 2006.

== Professional career ==
Joseph Deiss studied economics and social sciences for his first degree at the University of Fribourg. He continued to complete a doctorate at the same university after which he spent some time doing research at King&#x27;s College at the University of Cambridge.

After this period of research Joseph Deiss took on the post of lecturing Economics at the University of Fribourg. In 1983 he was made visiting professor at a number of Swiss universities: ETH Zurich, University of Lausanne and University of Geneva.

From 1993 to 1996 Joseph Deiss acted as National Price Supervisor. He then returned to the University of Fribourg to become the Dean of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences. At this time at university, Joseph Deiss was also the chairman of the Board of Directors at &quot;Schumacher AG&quot; in Schmitten (FR) and chairman of the Raiffeisenbank in Haut-Lac, Courtepin (FR).

In 2009 Joseph Deiss was awarded an honorary degree Doctor Honoris Causa from Business School Lausanne in recognition of his achievements to reinforce and expand the political and economic position of Switzerland.

== Personal life ==
Deiss is married and has three sons.

Joseph Deiss is an Honorary Member of The International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation

<text>Adidas AG (; stylized in all lowercase since 1949) is a German athletic apparel and footwear corporation headquartered in Herzogenaurach, Bavaria, Germany. It is the largest sportswear manufacturer in Europe, and the second largest in the world, after Nike. It is the holding company for the Adidas Group, which also owns an 8.33% stake of the football club Bayern Munich, and Runtastic, an Austrian fitness technology company. Adidas&#x27;s revenue for 2018 was listed at €21.915 billion.

The company was started by Adolf Dassler in his mother&#x27;s house. He was joined by his elder brother Rudolf in 1924 under the name &quot;Gebrüder Dassler Schuhfabrik&quot; (&quot;Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory&quot;). Dassler assisted in the development of spiked running shoes (spikes) for multiple athletic events. To enhance the quality of spiked athletic footwear, he transitioned from a previous model of heavy metal spikes to utilising canvas and rubber. Dassler persuaded U.S. sprinter Jesse Owens to use his handmade spikes at the 1936 Summer Olympics. In 1949, following a breakdown in the relationship between the brothers, Adolf created Adidas and Rudolf established Puma, which became Adidas&#x27;s business rival.

The three stripes are Adidas&#x27;s identity mark, having been used on the company&#x27;s clothing and shoe designs as a marketing aid. The branding, which Adidas bought in 1952 from Finnish sports company Karhu Sports for the equivalent of €1,600 and two bottles of whiskey, became so successful that Dassler described Adidas as &quot;The three stripes company&quot;.

== History ==
===Early years: the &quot;Gebrüder Dassler Schuhfabrik&quot;===
The company was founded by Adolf &quot;Adi&quot; Dassler who made sports shoes in his mother&#x27;s scullery or laundry room in Herzogenaurach, Germany after his return from World War I. In July 1924, his older brother Rudolf joined the business, which became &quot;Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory&quot; (). The electricity supply in Herzogenaurach was unreliable, so the brothers sometimes had to use pedal power from a stationary bicycle to run their equipment.

Dassler assisted in the development of spiked running shoes (spikes) for multiple athletic events. To enhance the quality of spiked athletic footwear, he transitioned from a previous model of heavy metal spikes to utilising canvas and rubber. In 1936, Dassler persuaded U.S. sprinter Jesse Owens to use his hand made spikes at the 1936 Summer Olympics. Following Owens&#x27; four gold medals, the name and reputation of Dassler shoes became known to the world&#x27;s sportsmen and their trainers. Business was successful and the Dasslers were selling 200,000 pairs of shoes every year before World War II.

Both Dassler brothers joined the Nazi Party (NSDAP) in May 1933 and became members of the National Socialist Motor Corps. Adolf took the rank of &quot;Sportwart&quot; in the Hitler Youth from 1935 until the end of the war. During the war, the company was running the last sport shoe factory in Germany and predominantly supplied the Wehrmacht with shoes. In 1943, their shoe production was forced to cease operations and the company&#x27;s facilities and workforce was used to manufacture anti-tank weapons. From 1942 to 1945, at least nine forced labourers were working at both sites of the company.

The Dassler factory, used for production of anti-tank weapons during World War II, was nearly destroyed in 1945 by US forces. It was spared when Adolf Dassler&#x27;s wife convinced the American soldiers that the company and its employees were only interested in manufacturing sports shoes. American occupying forces subsequently became major buyers of the Dassler brothers&#x27; shoes.

===Split and rivalry with Puma===
The brothers split up in 1947 after relations between them had broken down, with Adolf forming a company registered as Adidas AG, from &quot;Adi Dassler&quot;, on 18 August 1949, and Rudolf forming a new firm that he called Ruda – from &quot;Rudolf Dassler&quot;, later rebranded &quot;Puma&quot;. Urban myths have popularised two false backronyms for the name &quot;Adidas&quot;: &quot;All Day I Dream About Sports&quot; and &quot;All Day I Dream About Sex&quot;.

Adidas and Puma SE entered into a fierce and bitter business rivalry after the split. The town of Herzogenaurach was divided on the issue, leading to the nickname &quot;the town of bent necks&quot;—people looked down to see which shoes strangers wore. Even the town&#x27;s two football clubs were divided: ASV Herzogenaurach club was supported by Adidas, while 1 FC Herzogenaurach endorsed Rudolf&#x27;s footwear. When handymen were called to Rudolf&#x27;s home, they would deliberately wear Adidas shoes. Rudolf would tell them to go to the basement and pick out a pair of free Pumas. The two brothers never reconciled and although they are now buried in the same cemetery, they are spaced as far apart as possible.

In 1948, the first football match after World War II, several members of the West Germany national football team wore Puma boots, including the scorer of West Germany&#x27;s first post-war goal, Herbert Burdenski. Four years later, at the 1952 Summer Olympics, 1500 metres runner Josy Barthel of Luxembourg won Puma&#x27;s first Olympic gold in Helsinki, Finland.

At the 1960 Summer Olympics, Puma paid German sprinter Armin Hary to wear Pumas in the 100 meter sprint final. Hary had worn Adidas before and asked Adolf for payment, but Adidas rejected this request. The German won gold in Pumas, but then laced up Adidas for the medals ceremony, to the shock of the two Dassler brothers. Hary hoped to cash in from both, but Adi was so enraged he banned the Olympic champion.

The &quot;Pelé Pact&quot; was the most notable event in the Dassler brothers feud, when both owners of Adidas and Puma agreed not to sign a sponsorship deal with Pelé for the 1970 FIFA World Cup, feeling that a bidding war for the most famous athlete in the world would become too expensive, only for Puma to break the pact and sign him. Many business experts credit the brothers&#x27; rivalry and competition for transforming sports apparel into a multi-billion pound industry.

===Corporate image===


In 1952, following the 1952 Summer Olympics, Adidas acquired its signature 3-stripe logo from the Finnish athletic footwear brand Karhu Sports, for two bottles of whiskey and the equivalent of €1600.

The Trefoil logo was designed in 1971 and launched in 1972, just in time for the 1972 Summer Olympics held in Munich. This logo lasted until 1997, when the company introduced the &quot;three bars&quot; logo (that had been designed by then Creative Director Peter Moore), initially used on the &quot;Equipment&quot; range of products.

===Tapie affair===

After a period of trouble following the death of Adolf Dassler&#x27;s son Horst Dassler in 1987, the company was bought in 1990 by French industrialist Bernard Tapie, for ₣1.6 billion (now €243.9 million), which Tapie borrowed. Tapie was at the time a famous specialist of rescuing bankrupt companies, an expertise on which he built his fortune.

Tapie decided to move production offshore to Asia. He also hired Madonna for promotion. He sent, from Christchurch, New Zealand, a shoe sales representative to Germany and met Adolf Dassler&#x27;s descendants (Amelia Randall Dassler and Bella Beck Dassler) and was sent back with a few items to promote the company there.

In 1992, unable to pay the loan interest, Tapie mandated the Crédit Lyonnais bank to sell Adidas, and the bank subsequently converted the outstanding debt owed into equity of the enterprise, which was unusual as per the prevalent French banking practice. The state-owned bank had tried to get Tapie out of dire financial straits as a personal favour to Tapie, it is reported, because Tapie was Minister of Urban Affairs (&quot;ministre de la Ville&quot;) in the French government at the time.

Robert Louis-Dreyfus, a friend of Tapie, became the new CEO of the company in 1994. He was also the president of Olympique de Marseille, a team Tapie had owned until 1993. Tapie filed for personal bankruptcy in 1994. He was the object of several lawsuits, notably related to match fixing at the football club. During 1997, he served 6 months of an 18-month prison sentence in La Santé prison in Paris. In February 2000, Crédit Lyonnais sold Adidas to Louis-Dreyfus for a much higher amount of money than Tapie owed, 4.485 billion (€683.514 million) francs rather than 2.85 billion (€434.479 million).

===Post-Tapie era===

In 1994, combined with FIFA Youth Group, SOS Children&#x27;s Villages became the main beneficiary.

In 1997, Adidas AG acquired the Salomon Group who specialized in ski wear, and its official corporate name was changed to Adidas-Salomon AG. With this acquisition Adidas also acquired the TaylorMade golf company and Maxfli, which allowed them to compete with Nike Golf.

In 1998, Adidas sued the NCAA over their rules limiting the size and number of commercial logos on team uniforms and team clothing. Adidas withdrew the suit, and the two groups established guidelines as to what three-stripe designs would be considered uses of the Adidas trademark.

As CEO of Adidas, Louis-Dreyfus quadrupled revenue to €5.84 billion ($7.5 billion) from 1993 through 2000. In 2000, he announced he would resign the following year, due to illness.

In 2003, Adidas filed a lawsuit in a British court challenging Fitness World Trading&#x27;s use of a two-stripe motif similar to Adidas&#x27;s three stripes. The court ruled that despite the simplicity of the mark, &quot;Fitness World&quot;″s use was infringing because the public could establish a link between that use and Adidas&#x27;s mark.

In September 2004, English fashion designer Stella McCartney launched a joint-venture line with Adidas, establishing a long-term partnership with the corporation. This line is a sports performance collection for women called &quot;Adidas by Stella McCartney&quot;.

On 3 May 2005, Adidas informed the public that they had sold their partner company Salomon Group for €485 million to Amer Sports of Finland.

In August 2005, Adidas declared its intention to buy Reebok for $3.8 billion (US$). This takeover was completed with partnership in January 2006 and meant that the company had business sales closer to those of Nike in North America. The acquisition of Reebok also allowed Adidas to compete with Nike worldwide as the number two athletic shoemaker in the world.

In 2005, Adidas introduced the Adidas 1, the first ever production shoe to use a microprocessor. Dubbed by the company &quot;The World&#x27;s First Intelligent Shoe&quot;, it features a microprocessor capable of performing 5 million calculations per second that automatically adjusts the shoe&#x27;s level of cushioning to suit its environment. The shoe requires a small, user-replaceable battery that lasts for approximately 100 hours of running. On 25 November 2005, Adidas released a new version of the Adidas 1 with an increased range of cushioning, allowing the shoe to become softer or firmer, and a new motor with 153 percent more torque.

In April 2006, Adidas announced an 11-year deal to become the official NBA clothing provider. The company has been making NBA, NBDL, and WNBA jerseys and products as well as team-coloured versions of the &quot;Superstar&quot; basketball shoe. This deal (worth over $400 million) took over the previous Reebok deal that had been put in place in 2001 for 10 years.

In November 2011, Adidas announced that it would acquire outdoor action sport performance brand Five Ten through a share purchase agreement. The total purchase price was US$25 million in cash at closing.

=== Recent years ===

By the end of 2012, Adidas was reporting their highest revenues ever and Chief Executive Herbert Hainer expressed optimism for the year ahead. Adidas now has global corporate headquarters in Herzogenaurach, Germany and many other business locations around the world such as London, Portland, Toronto, Tokyo, Australia, Taiwan and Spain.

In January 2015, Adidas launched the footwear industry&#x27;s first reservation mobile app. The Adidas Confirmed app allows consumers to get access to and reserve the brand&#x27;s limited edition sneakers by using geo targeting technology.

On 24 March 2015, Adidas and McDonald&#x27;s unveiled the 2015 McDonald&#x27;s All-American uniforms. For the third year in a row, players will be wearing short-sleeved jerseys, made with the same lightweight and breathable material as the ones used in the NBA.

In August 2015, Adidas acquired fitness technology firm Runtastic for approximately $240 million.

In May 2017, Adidas sold TaylorMade golf company (including Ashworth) to KPS Capital Partners for $425 million.

In March 2022, Adidas sold Reebok to the Authentic Brands Group, for ca. $2.5 billion.

In August 2022, the company announced that CEO Kasper Rørsted would step down in 2023. Bjørn Gulden became CEO in January 2023.

The first Adidas item of apparel was the Franz Beckenbauer tracksuit created in 1967. Adidas AG is the largest manufacturer of sports bras in Europe, and the second largest manufacturer in the world.

===Sportswear===
====Association football====
One of the main focuses of Adidas has always been football kits, and the associated equipment. Adidas remains a major company in the global supply of team kits for international association football teams and clubs.

Adidas makes referee kits that are used in international competition and by many countries and leagues in the world. The company has been an innovator in the area of footwear for the sport, with notable examples including the 1979 release of the Copa Mundial moulded boot used for matches on firm dry pitches. It holds the accolade of the best selling boot of all time. The soft-ground equivalent was named World Cup and it too remains on the market.
Since 1970, FIFA, the world governing body of football, has commissioned specially designed footballs for use in its own World Cup tournaments. The Adidas Telstar was the first ball commissioned for the World Cup in 1970. The balls supplied for the 2006 World Cup, the &quot;Teamgeist&quot;, were particularly noteworthy for their ability to travel further than previous types when struck, leading to longer range goals. Goalkeepers were generally believed to be less comfortable with the design of the ball, claiming it was prone to move significantly and unpredictably in flight.
Adidas introduced the Jabulani for the 2010 World Cup. The ball was designed and developed by Loughborough University in conjunction with Bayern München. The Adidas Brazuca for the 2014 World Cup was the first World Cup ball named by the fans. In 2022, for the 14th time in a row, Adidas created the 2022 World Cup ball, Al Rihla.

Adidas is one of the official sponsors of the UEFA Champions League, and the Adidas Finale is the competition&#x27;s official match ball. Along with the aforementioned Adidas Predator boot, Adidas manufactures the adiPure range of football boots. Adidas named an official match ball of the UEFA Euro 2016 tournament the Adidas Beau Jeu which translates to &quot;The Beautiful Game&quot; in English. Adidas provides clothing and equipment for all teams in Major League Soccer.

====Baseball====
Adidas has also provided baseball equipment and sponsors numerous players of Major League Baseball and Nippon Professional Baseball in Japan.

Adidas Baseball hardgoods are licensed to Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods.

From 1997 to 2008, Adidas sponsored the New York Yankees.

====Basketball====
Adidas&#x27;s Superstar and Pro Model shoes, affectionately known as &quot;shelltoes&quot; for their stylized hard rubber toe box, were fueled by, among others, coaches such as UCLA&#x27;s John Wooden. Adidas drew about even with Converse in basketball by the mid-1970s before both started to fall behind then-upstart Nike in the early 1980s. Subsequently, Adidas Superstar became very popular in the 1980s hip hop streetwear scene alongside Adidas&#x27;s stripe-sided polyester suits.

From 2006 to 2017, Adidas was the uniform supplier of all the 30 teams in the National Basketball Association, replacing the Reebok brand after Adidas&#x27;s acquisition of Reebok. Adidas was replaced by Nike as the official uniform supplier of the league after the 2016–17 season.

====Cricket====
Adidas began manufacturing cricket footwear in the mid-1970s, with their initial target market being Australia. Their shoes were a radical departure from traditional leather cricket boots which had remained basically unchanged for decades, being lighter and more flexible but also offering less toe protection, so that it became not uncommon to see batsmen who had been struck by the ball on the foot hopping around in pain. Having continued to manufacture cricket footwear for many years, in 2006 the company finally entered the field of bat manufacture in 2008 and currently their bat range includes the Pellara, Incurza, Libro and M-Blaster models.

In the 1990s, Adidas signed the superstar Indian batsman Sachin Tendulkar and made shoes for him. From 2008 until his retirement, Adidas had sponsored the cricket bat used by Tendulkar. It created a new bat, &#x27;Adidas MasterBlaster Elite&#x27;, personalized for him.

In 2008, Adidas made a concerted move into English cricket market by sponsoring English batting star Kevin Pietersen after the cancellation of his lifetime deal with Woodworm, when they ran into financial difficulties. The following year they signed up fellow England player Ian Bell, Pakistan opening batsman Salman Butt and Indian Player Ravindra Jadeja.

In the Indian Premier League (IPL), Adidas sponsored the team Mumbai Indians from 2008 to 2014 and Delhi Daredevils from 2008 to 2013. They were the official sponsors of Pune Warriors India in 2011 and 2012, however the team was banned from IPL due to payment issues. In the 2015 Season, Adidas sponsored Royal Challengers Bangalore.

In 2023 Adidas sponsored Indian national cricket team as a Sportswear for men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s.

Materials that Adidas provided were jerseys, shorts, shoes, shafts, heads, gloves, and protective pieces.

Products manufactured for the sport are sticks, gloves, protective gear and boots.

====Running====

Adidas currently manufactures several running and lifestyle shoes, including the Energy-boost, and the spring-blade trainers. The brand has built a strong runners&#x27; network within big European capitals, such as Paris&#x27; &quot;Boost Energy League&quot;. In 2016, the 3rd season launched. In Paris, the Boost Energy League gathers 11 teams representing different districts of Paris.

Adidas launched two new color ways of the NMD R1 and one new color way of the NMD XR1 in September 2016.

In November 2016, Adidas teased a sneaker made from ocean plastic. The shoe is created from a fabric called &quot;Biosteel&quot;. The shoe is called the &quot;Adidas Futurecraft Biofabric.&quot; The material used is 15% lighter than conventional silk fibers, and is 100% biodegradable. The shoe only begin to dissolve when it is put in contact with a high concentration of the digestion enzyme proteinase, which occurs naturally. Once this happens, the shoes can decompose within 36 hours. The shoe was never released.

Adidas EQT is a style of sneakers from Adidas. It originated in the early 1990s and was relaunched in 2017. The latest Adidas EQT line released in a &quot;Turbo Red&quot; Pack on 26 January 2017, and included models such as the Adidas EQT Support 93/17, EQT Support ADV, and EQT Support Ultra. Adidas.com is one of the few online retailers.

====Skateboarding====
Adidas Skateboarding produces shoes made specifically for skateboarding, including the redesign of previous models for skateboarding. The brand also releases signature models designed by team riders.

====Tennis====
Adidas has been involved with tennis equipment since the mid-1960s and has historically sponsored many top tennis players, beginning with two of the most dominant male tennis players at the start of the professional era in the late 1960s, Stan Smith and Ilie Nastase. During the 1980s and 1990s, not only were they exclusive apparel and footwear sponsors of world number one men&#x27;s tennis players Ivan Lendl and Stefan Edberg and ladies&#x27; world number one Steffi Graf, but each player had their own, exclusive graphic styles designed for their use during play, which were in turn marketed to the general public.

Ivan Lendl even spent the vast majority of his dominant career playing with several different models of Adidas tennis racquets, primarily using the Adidas GTX-Pro and then later the Adidas GTX Pro-T. In 2009, the company introduced a new line of tennis racquets. While the Feather was made for the &quot;regular player&quot;, and the Response for the &quot;club player&quot;, Adidas targeted the &quot;tournament player&quot; with the 12.2 oz Barricade tour model.

====Kabaddi====
Adidas entered Kabaddi which is still a non-Olympic sport but highly popular in the Indian subcontinent and Asian countries. In 2014, with the launch of Pro Kabaddi League a city based franchise league in India, Kabaddi took the region by storm. In 2015, they tied up with Mumbai-based franchise U Mumba.

===Accessories===

Adidas also designs and makes slide-style sandals, mobile accessories, watches, eyewear, bags, baseball caps, and socks. As well, Adidas has a branded range of male and female deodorants, perfumes, aftershave and lotions.

Adidas announced they would be launching a new $199 Fit Smart wristband in mid-August 2014. The wristband will pair with Adidas&#x27;s miCoach app, which acts as a personal trainer.

====Adilette====

Adilette was the first ever pair of sandals made by Adidas, originally developed in 1963. Adidas claims that a group of athletes approached Adi Dassler requesting a shoe be made for the locker room. To this day, the resulting sandals are a best-seller. Since the original navy blue and white Adilette sandals were created nearly fifty years ago, more varieties have been created in different colours (black, red, green, grey, orange, brown, yellow, pink, golden, silver).

Most recently, Adidas has introduced a colour scheme that goes along with its Predator and adizero line; the scheme is dubbed warning (orange) and purple. Usually, the three stripes appear in the contrasting colour on the strap of the classic models. The most common Adilette livery is in navy blue or black, mixed with white colours. Also the Woodilette and Trefoil models follow a similar design but without stripes on the strap.

The model provides a contoured orthopedic rubber sole with synthetic upper, and was designed as an after sport slide sandal, but the Adilette were quickly adopted outside of the sporting world.

====Adissage====

Adissage is also a slide sandal. Available in black, navy, light blue, black with pink, and other assorted colors, the sandal has the trademarked three stripes on a velcro strap toward the front of the shoe. On the side of the shoe, toward the heel on either side, the manufacturers name appears, as well as on a round emblem in the actual heel of the footbed. Notably, there are tiny black massage nubs throughout the foot-bed for the purpose of massaging foot aches after sport, although popular as a casual sandal amongst non-athletes as well.

====Santiossage====
The Santiossage is a slide-style sandal. The sandal has the trademarked three stripes on a velcro strap toward the front of the shoe. Santiossage comes in black, navy, or red. On the side of the shoe, toward the heel on either side, the manufacturer&#x27;s name appears, as well as on a round emblem in the actual heel of the foot-bed. Like the Adissage there are tiny clear massage nubs throughout the foot-bed for the purpose of massaging after-sport footaches, although the sandals are worn casually among non-athletes. Seen through these clear nubs are Adidas&#x27;s three stripes.

==Marketing==
During the mid to late 1990s, Adidas divided the brand into three main groups with each a separate focus: Adidas Performance was designed to maintain their devotion to the athlete; Adidas Originals was designed to focus on the brand&#x27;s earlier designs which remained a popular life-style icon; and Style Essentials, which dealt with the fashion market; the main group within this being Y-3 (which is a collaboration between Adidas and renowned Japanese fashion designer Yohji Yamamoto - the Y representing Yamamoto and the 3 representing the three stripes of Adidas).

Launched in 2004, &quot;Impossible is Nothing&quot; is one of the company&#x27;s most memorable campaigns. The campaign was developed by 180/TBWA based in Amsterdam, but significant work was also done by TBWA\Chiat\Day in San Francisco. A few years later, Adidas launched a basketball specific campaign -- &quot;Believe in 5ive&quot;—for the 2006-2007 NBA season.

In 2011, &quot;Adidas is all in&quot; became the global marketing strategy slogan for Adidas. The slogan aimed to tie all brands and labels together, presenting a unified image to consumers interested in sports, fashion, street, music and pop culture. There appears to be connection with the phrase &quot;all-in&quot; meaning &quot;exhausted&quot; in some English speaking nations.

In 2015, Adidas launched &quot;Creating the New&quot; as its strategic business plan until 2020.

===Collaborations===
Adidas has done several collaborations with well known designers, including Alexander Wang, Jeremy Scott, Raf Simons, and Stella McCartney. They have also reached out to several celebrities, such as Beyoncé, Jonah Hill, Karlie Kloss, Ninja and Pharrell Williams to create some of the company&#x27;s most notable and coveted pieces.

===Game advertisement===
The brand is featured in several games, including &quot;Daley Thompson&#x27;s Olympic Challenge&quot; (Commodore Amiga), &quot;Adidas power soccer&quot; (Sony PlayStation) and &quot;Adidas Championship Football&quot; (Commodore 64, ZX spectrum, Amstrad CPC).

=== Marketing in India ===
India has been a very speculative market for Adidas. Despite this Dave Thomas, managing director of Adidas in India is ambitious for the country&#x27;s potential. The company hoped to double its revenue from Rs. 805 crores by 2020. In 2015, the company signed Ranveer Singh a Bollywood actor as a brand ambassador to the company&#x27;s products. Singh then was a budding actor. The company later decided to use the Indian people&#x27;s passion for the game of cricket to promote their brand and launched a new cricket campaign in the country. The campaign was called FeelLoveUseHate with Indian cricketer Virat Kohli. However, in 2017, Virat Kohli was removed as the brand ambassador of the company. The cricketer later signed a major deal with Puma India. The company also sells its products online through e-commerce websites such as Myntra, Snapdeal, Jabong and Amazon. Adidas also has a website dedicated to the Indian audience that markets and sells products to its consumers in India.

==Sponsorship==

Adidas has numerous major kit deals with football clubs worldwide, including their main sponsor Bayern Munich. Moreover, their sponsored national teams include Germany, Spain, Mexico, Argentina, Sweden, Japan, Hungary, Belgium, Colombia, Wales, Chile and Italy.

Adidas is one of the official sponsors of the UEFA Champions League, and the Adidas Finale is the competition&#x27;s official match ball. Along with the Adidas Predator boot, Adidas manufactures the adiPure range of football boots. Adidas provides clothing and equipment for all teams in Major League Soccer (MLS).

In July 2014, Adidas and Manchester United agreed to a ten-year kit deal, beginning with the 2015–16 Premier League season. This kit deal has a guaranteed minimum value of £750 million (US$1.29 billion), making it the most valuable kit deal in sports history, and replaced rival Nike as the club&#x27;s global equipment partner.
In November 2009, World Number 4 tennis player Andy Murray was confirmed as Adidas&#x27;s highest-paid star with a five-year contract reportedly worth US$24.5 million. In Cincinnati, at the ATP Tennis Tournament in Mason, they have also sponsored the ball-boy and ball-girl uniforms. Adidas is also partners with Malibu Tennis Camp, Green Fitness GmbH and with Schöler &amp; Micke Sportartikel Vertriebs GmbH.

Adidas has sponsored numerous basketball players like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (first ever NBA player signed with Adidas and first ever player overall with signature shoes), Chauncey Billups, Tim Duncan, Brandon Knight, Jeremy Lin, Tracy McGrady, Iman Shumpert and present players like James Harden, Damian Lillard, Donovan Mitchell, Candace Parker, Derrick Rose, John Wall and Trae Young. Adidas also endorsed Kobe Bryant with the Adidas Equipment KB8 as his first signature shoe until July 2002. The company also endorsed Kevin Garnett until he opted out of his contract in 2010. Gilbert Arenas was an Adidas endorser until 2010. In August 2015, James Harden left Nike for Adidas by signing a 13-year contract reportedly worth US$200 million.

In rugby union, Adidas is the current kit supplier to the All Blacks, the France national team, the Italian national rugby team and the South African Stormers and Western Province rugby union teams among others. Adidas is also the New Zealand Rugby Union clothing sponsor and supplies clothing to all Super Rugby franchises up till 2022, a selection of domestic teams and national referees. Adidas are also the official match ball supplier to the Heineken Cup. Adidas was the British and Irish Lions kit supplier from 1997 to 2013. They are the jersey manufacturers of the Gold Coast Titans Rugby League club in the Australasian National Rugby League. Dual rugby and league international and former boxer Sonny Bill Williams is a global ambassador for Adidas.

Adidas has provided field hockey equipment and sponsors numerous players of Germany, England, Netherlands, Australia, Spain and Belgium. The company has been the kit provider of Argentine women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s teams for over 15 years. The company also sponsored clubs Reading, Beeston and East Grinstead.

Adidas also sponsors professional golfers including Collin Morikawa, Ludvig Åberg, Nick Dunlap, Tyrrell Hatton, Daniel Berger and Nick Taylor. Since Adidas does not make golf equipment the sponsorship is more limited to clothing and shoes.

In ice hockey, Adidas signed an agreement with National Hockey League (NHL) to be the official outfitter of uniforms and licensed apparel, starting in the 2017–18 season, lasting through the 2023–24 season.

Adidas&#x27;s cricket sponsorships include cricketers Lasith Malinga, Kieron Pollard, Dwayne Bravo and K. L. Rahul. Adidas&#x27;s volleyball sponsorships include Ivan Zaytsev and Earvin N&#x27;Gapeth, who advertises as a model and brand ambassador for Adidas.

==IP protection==
In 2016, Adidas filed lawsuits against Skechers for making a duplicate Stan Smith design and for Adidas replicas such as &quot;Springblade&quot;.

==Criticism==

Adidas&#x27;s business practises/ethics and commitment to worker welfare have been scrutinised and often criticised.

===2011 All Blacks replica rugby jersey pricing===

Unhappy with the local price of the Adidas replica All Blacks jersey, New Zealand-based All Blacks fans asked for price cuts and began purchasing the jersey from overseas vendors after it was revealed that the local price of NZ$220 was more than twice the price offered on some websites.

Adidas has responded by enforcing cross-border agreements to stop overseas retailers from selling to New Zealand residents. It has been labelled a public relations disaster by leading New Zealand PR firms and Consumer advocate groups. The largest New Zealand sportswear retailer Rebel Sport has stated it is angry and is considering selling the All Blacks Jerseys to the general public below cost.

===2012 &quot;shackle&quot; sneakers===
On 14 June 2012, Adidas posted on their Facebook page a picture of a pair of Jeremy Scott-designed shoes containing shackles. The picture was of a planned shoe line that Adidas intended to release in July. The photo caused controversy. Jesse Jackson was quoted as saying: &quot;The attempt to commercialize and make popular more than 200 years of human degradation, where blacks were considered three-fifths human by our Constitution is offensive, appalling and insensitive&quot;. Jackson threatened a boycott, and NBA commissioner David Stern was at one point reportedly contacted in hopes that he would intervene. Shortly after the outcry, the company cancelled the product.

===Sweatshops and labour standards===
Adidas has been criticized for operating sweatshops, particularly in Indonesia. Between 2006 and 2007, Adidas rejected many of its suppliers that supported unions in favour of subcontractors with worse labour rights records. By subcontracting work to different suppliers, it is more difficult for Adidas to ensure company labour standards are enforced. Adidas&#x27;s policy includes the freedom for workers to take part in collective bargaining and a non-retaliation policy towards workers who express concerns. In practice, however, many of Adidas&#x27;s suppliers have not upheld these standards. At the Panarub factory in Java, 33 workers were fired after striking for better pay in 2005.

PT Kizone is another Indonesian factory where Adidas has been criticized over treatment of workers. They produced products for Adidas as well as Nike and the Dallas Cowboys until they closed in January 2011. 2,686 workers who were laid off are owed $3 million in severance pay and benefits. Nike has contributed $1.5 million but Adidas has not acted. A campaign has been initiated by United Students Against Sweatshops calling for universities to cut contracts with Adidas.

On 16 July 2012, War on Want organised activists in London to replace Adidas price tags in sports stores with 34p ones, a reference to the low hourly wage rate paid to the Indonesian workers who make Adidas goods. The campaign group Labour Behind the Label claimed that the basic pay of Indonesian Adidas workers was only £10 a week. William Anderson, head of social and environmental affairs for the Asia Pacific region, posted an entry on the company blog in which he claimed that total wages including bonuses and overtime were often double the hourly wage, and drew attention to purchasing power parity.

In April 2014, one of the biggest strikes on mainland China took place at the Yue Yuen Industrial Holdings Dongguan shoe factory, producing amongst others for Adidas.

In 2022, researchers from Nordhausen University of Applied Sciences identified cotton from Xinjiang in Adidas shirts.

===Soviet themed items, and advertising===
In 2018, Adidas promoted a line of Soviet themed items. After a social media outcry, they were taken off the market.

===NCAA corruption scandal===
Adidas executive James Gatto was indicted in the 2017 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball corruption scandal.

===Racial diversity controversy===
In June 2020, the head of global human resources at Adidas, Karen Parkin, voluntarily stepped down after some black employees raised concerns about her failure to address racism and discrimination in the workplace. The former HR chief had also made a comment about racism being &quot;noise&quot;, in addition to not adequately addressing workforce diversity. Upon her resignation, she made a statement saying that she supports the company&#x27;s continued progress towards racial justice and offered an apology.

===SL 72 sneaker advertising campaign===
In July 2024, Adidas withdrew and apologized for their advertising campaign starring Bella Hadid for the SL 72 which was originally created for the 1972 Munich Olympics where the massacre of 11 Israeli athletes took place.
