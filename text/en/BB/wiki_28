<text>The Democratic Labor Party (DLP) was an Australian political party. The party came into existence following the 1955 ALP split as the Australian Labor Party (Anti-Communist), and was renamed the Democratic Labor Party in 1957. In 1962, the Queensland Labor Party, a breakaway party of the Queensland branch of the Australian Labor Party, became the Queensland branch of the DLP.

In 1978, a new Democratic Labor Party was founded by members of the original party, which remains active as of 2025.

==History==
===Origins===

The Australian Labor Party (Anti-Communist) was formed as a result of a split in the Australian Labor Party (ALP) which began in 1954. The split was between the party&#x27;s national leadership, under the then party leader Dr H. V. Evatt, and the majority of the Victorian branch, which was dominated by a faction composed largely of ideologically-driven anti-Communist Catholics. Many ALP members during the Cold War period, most but not all of them Catholics, became alarmed at what they saw as the growing power of the Communist Party of Australia within the country&#x27;s trade unions. These members formed units within the unions, called Industrial Groups, to combat this alleged infiltration.

The intellectual leader of the Victorian Catholic wing of the ALP was B. A. Santamaria, a Roman Catholic Italian-Australian Melbourne lawyer and lay anti-Communist activist, who acquired the patronage of Dr Mannix. Santamaria headed &quot;The Catholic Social Studies Movement&quot; (often known as &quot;The Movement&quot;), modeled on Catholic Action groups in Europe and, ironically, in organizational terms, on some of the methods employed by its principal target, the Communist Party of Australia. That group later became the National Civic Council (NCC). Evatt denounced the &quot;Movement&quot; and the Industrial Groups in 1954, alleging they were disloyal and trying to deflect the Labour Movement from pursuing Labor objectives.

At the 1955 ALP national conference in Hobart, Santamaria&#x27;s parliamentary supporters in the federal and Victorian parliaments were expelled from the ALP. A total of seven Victorian federal MPs and 18 state MPs were expelled. The federal MPs were: Tom Andrews, Bill Bourke, Bill Bryson, Jack Cremean, Bob Joshua, Stan Keon and Jack Mullens. In New South Wales, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Sydney, Norman Cardinal Gilroy, the first native-born Australian Roman Catholic prelate, opposed the Movement&#x27;s tactics, and there was no party split in that state.

The expelled ALP members formed the Australian Labor Party (Anti-Communist) under the influence of B. A. Santamaria. Ideologically, the ALP (Anti-Communist) followed universalism and kept the NCC anti-communist position. Following the stance of the Roman Catholic Church towards the White Australia policy after 1952, the ALP (Anti-Communist) was also oppositor of said policy.

===1950s to 1970s===
====1955 elections====
On the night of 19 April 1955, Liberal and Country Party leader Henry Bolte moved a motion of no-confidence against John Cain&#x27;s Labor government in the Victorian Legislative Assembly. After twelve hours of debate on the motion, in the early hours of 20 April, 11 of the expelled Labor members crossed the floor to support Bolte&#x27;s motion. With his government defeated, Cain sought and received a dissolution of parliament later that day, with the election set down for 28 May 1955. 

At the election, 11 of the 12 expelled MPs in the Victorian Legislative Assembly, as well as other candidates, and the one MP facing re-election in the Victorian Legislative Council lost their seats. The party drew 12.6% of the vote, mainly from the ALP, which was directed to the non-Labor parties. Labor won 37.6% of the vote and 20 seats to the Liberals&#x27; 34 and the Country Party&#x27;s ten. The Cain Labor Government lost government at the 1955 election. Only one of the expelled Labor members, Frank Scully, was re-elected for the seat of Richmond. Scully had been a Minister in the Cain Government and a member of the Movement, and was expelled from the ministry and the ALP as part of the 1955 split. Five other MPs whose terms had not expired remained in the Legislative Council until the expiry of their terms at the 1958 Victorian election, and all who recontested their seats were defeated.

At the 1955 federal election held in December, all the 7 expelled federal MPs were defeated. However, Frank McManus was elected as a senator for Victoria at the 1955 election, and successful ALP candidate George Cole had chosen before the election to become part of this party.

====Membership====
The parliamentary membership of the ALP (Anti-Communist) was almost entirely Roman Catholic of Irish descent. The only two non-Catholics were its federal leader, Bob Joshua, who represented Ballarat in the Australian House of Representatives, and Jack Little, who led the party in the Victoria Legislative Council between 1955 and 1958. It has been suggested that the party was substantially a party of Irish-ethnics, a result of the ALP split of 1955 being a &#x27;de-ethnicisation&#x27;, a forcible removal of the Irish-Catholic element within the ALP. However, many ALP (Anti-Communist) members were not of Irish descent. The party attracted many voters among migrants from Catholic countries in southern Europe, and among anti-Communist Eastern European refugees.

A significant minority of its voters were also non-Catholics. Journalist Don Whitington argued in 1964 that the DLP, as a basically sectarian party, was a most dangerous and distasteful force in Australian politics. Whitington observed that the party was backed by influential sections of the Roman Catholic Church, and that although the party professed to exist primarily to combat communism, it had less commendable reasons behind its coming into being. Daniel Mannix, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Melbourne, was a DLP supporter, as were other influential clerics.

====Democratic Labor Party====
In 1957, the ALP (A-C) changed its name to the Democratic Labor Party (DLP), although the exact date of the party&#x27;s renaming is unclear. At least one source claims it was renamed in 1956, but this appears to have been the founding of a DLP in New South Wales (where an ALP split had largely been avoided). The NSW DLP was separate to the ALP (A-C), and NSW DLP president Alan Manning said it was not connected &quot;in anyway&quot; to the Victorian-based party, saying &quot;if B. A. Santamaria joined the Democratic Labor Party I would get out of it&quot;. The Tasmanian branch of the ALP (A-C) chose to affiliate with the NSW DLP in February 1957, and &quot;Tribune&quot; reported that Manning was &quot;trying to link the anti-Communist Labor Parties and the DLP into a national party&quot;. Beginning in May 1957, the DLP name began to be used outside of NSW. On 27 August 1957, Tasmanian senator George Cole officially informed the Senate that the ALP (A-C) has been renamed to the DLP following a conference held on 18 August 1957.

In the same year, the Labor Party split in Queensland following the expulsion of Vince Gair, a conservative Catholic, from the party. He and his followers formed the Queensland Labor Party, which, in 1962, became the Queensland branch of the DLP.

Between 1955 and 1974 the DLP was able to command a significant vote, particularly in Victoria and Queensland, with their large numbers of Catholics. During the period the party held between one and five seats in the Senate (which is elected by proportional representation). The DLP Senate leaders were George Cole (from Tasmania; 1955–1965), Vince Gair (from Queensland; 1965–1973), and Frank McManus (from Victoria; 1973–1974). Other DLP Senators were Condon Byrne (from Queensland), Jack Kane (from New South Wales), and Jack Little, a Protestant (from Victoria).

No DLP Senators or state politicians were ever elected in South Australia or Western Australia. Owing largely to demographic reasons, the ALP did not split in these states, although some lay branch members switched to the new party once it had been established. As the ALP and the conservative parties traditionally held approximately equal numbers of seats in the Senate, the DLP was able to use the balance of power in the Senate to extract concessions from Liberal governments, particularly larger government grants to Catholic schools, greater spending on defence, and non-recognition of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

During this period the DLP exercised influence by directing its preferences to Liberal candidates in federal and state elections (see Australian electoral system), thus helping to keep the ALP out of office at the federal level and in Victoria. The DLP vote for the House of Representatives gradually declined during the 1960s, but remained strong enough for the Liberals to continue to need DLP preferences to win close elections.

After Evatt&#x27;s retirement in 1960, his successor Arthur Calwell, a Catholic, tried to bring about a reconciliation between the ALP and the DLP. Negotiations were conducted through intermediaries, and in 1965 a deal was almost done. Three out of four of the ALP&#x27;s parliamentary leaders agreed to a deal. However, Calwell refused to share power within the party with the DLP leadership on a membership number basis, so the deal failed. Santamaria later claimed that had he accepted, Calwell could have become prime minister. Indeed, at the 1961 federal election Labor came up just two seats short of toppling the Coalition. One of those seats was Bruce, in the DLP&#x27;s heartland of Melbourne. DLP preferences allowed Liberal Billy Snedden to win a paper-thin victory. Although the Coalition was only assured of a sixth term in government later in the night with an even narrower win in the Brisbane-area seat of Moreton, any realistic chance of a Labor win ended with the Liberals retaining Bruce. Without Bruce, the best Labor could have done was a hung parliament.

At the 1969 federal election, DLP preferences kept Calwell&#x27;s successor Gough Whitlam from toppling the Coalition, despite winning an 18-seat swing and a majority of the two-party vote. DLP preferences in four Melbourne-area seats allowed the Liberals to narrowly retain them; had those preferences gone the other way, Labor would have garnered the swing it needed to make Whitlam Prime Minister.

The DLP&#x27;s policies were traditional Labor policies such as more spending on health, education and pensions, combined with strident opposition to communism, and a greater emphasis on defence spending. The DLP strongly supported Australia&#x27;s participation in the Vietnam War.

From the early 1960s onward the DLP became increasingly socially conservative, opposing homosexuality, abortion, pornography and drug use. This stand against &quot;permissiveness&quot; appealed to many conservative voters as well as the party&#x27;s base among Catholics. Some members of the DLP disagreed with this, believing the party should stay focused on anti-communism.

The highest DLP vote was 11.11 per cent, which occurred at the 1970 half-senate election. Whitlam and the ALP won government in the 1972 election, defeating the DLP&#x27;s strategy of keeping the ALP out of power.

===Decline===

In 1973, it was reported that the Country Party and the DLP were considering a merger. In response, Gough Whitlam said he was delighted to see &quot;the old harlot churched&quot;.

By this point, the party&#x27;s emphasis on Senate results had led to a steady decline in their primary vote for the House of Representatives, and according to Tom King of Australian National University a large amount of the support for the DLP by this point came as a result of protest votes against the two major parties, rather than any definitive ideological base. A softening of attitudes towards Communism both in Australia and within the Catholic Church meant that the party increasingly sounded old-fashioned and ideologically adrift, a perception that was not helped by the advanced age of the DLP&#x27;s parliamentarians.

In 1974, Whitlam appointed Gair as ambassador to Ireland in a successful bid to split the DLP and remove its influence. The party lost all its Senate seats at the 1974 federal election.

In April 1976, the Queensland and South Australian branches of the DLP were dissolved. The party only stood candidates in Victoria at the 1977 federal election, without success. In April 1978 it was reported in &quot;The Bulletin&quot; that the New South Wales state council would meet in June 1978 to determine the future of the party.

In March 1978, the Victorian branch voted to dissolve The vote to dissolve was carried by 110 votes to 100. Some members of the party refused to accept the vote and formed a continuity DLP, which they claimed was a continuation of the original DLP. However, that claim was disputed by almost all the officers of the original DLP.

<text>XDCC (Xabi DCC or eXtended DCC) is a computer file sharing method which uses the Internet Relay Chat (IRC) network as a host service.

== History ==
Limitations in the original DCC protocol prevented the transfers of very large files, or groups of files. XDCC was developed to allow batching of files together, and requesting/sending those files to others.

XDCC was initially a script written in 1994 for ircII by Xabi. This script extends the ircII DCC command. Now XDCC refers to IRC bots running file sharing programs in general. XDCC bots serve one or more usually large files for download using the DCC protocol. XDCC is commonly employed in distributing illegal content, such as warez releases of software, music, and movies.

== Features ==

Unlike peer-to-peer transfers, XDCC servers are often hosted on connections with very high upstream bandwidth, sometimes in excess of 100 Mbit. Often FTP servers are also running on the XDCC servers to facilitate uploading of materials to them. Many XDCC servers run on security compromised computers.

== Usage ==

A stand-alone IRC client such as mIRC or HexChat is required to use the DCC protocol. In order to receive files, the software has to be properly configured, otherwise downloads will be rejected by the software.

To use XDCC, one can send a private message (query) or send a CTCP command to a bot, using an IRC client. The user can ask a bot what files it has by private messaging &quot;xdcc list&quot; to the bot. However, this feature is often disabled as to not attract too much attention. When a user wants to download a packet or file from a bot, the user would type something such as &quot;xdcc send #&lt;pack number&gt;&quot; to the bot. The bot will either start sending the user the packet or the bot will place the user in a queue, and force the user to wait their turn. Some channels have special rules, for example requiring the user to join a second channel within a certain amount of time after starting the download to avoid interruptions.

Addons exist, such as XDCCKlipper (for mIRC) which listen to adverts listed in a channel by the bots and save them to a separate window to facilitate easier browsing and allow users to view the status of a bot (speed, queues, slots etc.).

<text>The University of California, Riverside (UCR or UC Riverside) is a public land-grant research university in Riverside, California, United States. It is one of the ten campuses of the University of California system. The main campus sits on in a suburban district of Riverside with a branch campus of in Palm Desert. In 1907, the predecessor to UCR was founded as the UC Citrus Experiment Station, Riverside which pioneered research in biological pest control and the use of growth regulators.

UCR&#x27;s undergraduate College of Letters and Science opened in 1954. The Regents of the University of California declared UCR a general campus of the system in 1959, and graduate students were admitted in 1961. To accommodate an enrollment of 21,000 students by 2015, more than $730 million has been invested in new construction projects since 1999. UCR plans to have 35,000 students by 2035. Preliminary accreditation of the UC Riverside School of Medicine was granted in October 2012 and the first class of 50 students was enrolled in August 2013. It is the first new research-based public medical school in 40 years. UCR is a member of the Association of American Universities.

In 2000, UC Riverside was classified as an &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity.&quot; UCR&#x27;s sports teams are known as the Highlanders and play in the Big West Conference of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I. Their nickname was inspired by the high altitude of the campus, which lies on the foothills of Box Springs Mountain.

==History==


At the turn of the 20th century, Southern California was a major producer of citrus, the region&#x27;s primary agricultural export. The industry developed from the country&#x27;s first navel orange trees, planted in Riverside in 1873. Lobbied by the citrus industry, the UC Regents established the UC Citrus Experiment Station (CES) on February 14, 1907, on of land on the east slope of Mount Rubidoux in Riverside. The station conducted experiments in fertilization, irrigation and crop improvement. In 1917, the station was moved to a larger site, near Box Springs Mountain.

The 1944 passage of the GI Bill during World War II set in motion a rise in college enrollments that necessitated an expansion of the state university system in California. A local group of citrus growers and civic leaders, including many UC Berkeley alumni, lobbied aggressively for a UC-administered liberal arts college next to the CES. State Senator Nelson S. Dilworth authored Senate Bill 512 (1949) which former Assemblyman Philip L. Boyd and Assemblyman John Babbage (both of Riverside) were instrumental in shepherding through the State Legislature. Governor Earl Warren signed the bill in 1949, allocating $2 million for initial campus construction.

Gordon S. Watkins, dean of the UCLA College of Letters and Science, became the first provost of the new college at Riverside. Initially conceived of as a small college devoted to the liberal arts, he ordered the campus built for a maximum of 1,500 students and recruited many young junior faculty to fill teaching positions. He presided at its opening with 65 faculty and 127 students on February 14, 1954, remarking, &quot;Never have so few been taught by so many.&quot;

UCR&#x27;s enrollment exceeded 1,000 students by the time Clark Kerr became president of the UC system in 1958. Anticipating a &quot;tidal wave&quot; in enrollment growth required by the baby boom generation, Kerr developed the California Master Plan for Higher Education and the Regents designated Riverside a general university campus in 1959. UCR&#x27;s first chancellor, Herman Theodore Spieth, oversaw the beginnings of the school&#x27;s transition to a full university and its expansion to a capacity of 5,000 students. UCR&#x27;s second chancellor, Ivan Hinderaker led the campus through the era of the free speech movement and kept student protests peaceful in Riverside. According to a 1998 interview with Hinderaker, the city of Riverside received negative press coverage for smog after the mayor asked Governor Ronald Reagan to declare the South Coast Air Basin a disaster area in 1971; subsequent student enrollment declined by up to 25% through 1979. Hinderaker&#x27;s development of innovative programs in business administration and biomedical sciences created incentive for enough students to enroll at Riverside to keep the campus open.

In the 1990s, UC experienced a new surge of enrollment applications, now known as &quot;Tidal Wave II&quot;. The Regents targeted UCR for an annual growth rate of 6.3%, the fastest in the UC system, and anticipated 19,900 students at UCR by 2010. By 1995, African American, American Indian, and Latino student enrollments accounted for 30% of the UCR student body, the highest proportion of any UC campus at the time. The 1997 implementation of Proposition 209—which banned the use of affirmative action by state agencies—reduced the ethnic diversity at the more selective UC campuses but further increased it at UCR.

With UCR scheduled for dramatic population growth, efforts have been made to increase its popular and academic recognition. The students voted for a fee increase to move UCR athletics into NCAA Division I standing in 1998. In the 1990s, proposals were made to establish a law school, a medical school, and a school of public policy at UCR, with the UCR School of Medicine and the School of Public Policy becoming reality in 2012. In June 2006, UCR received its largest gift, 15.5 million from two local couples, in trust towards building its medical school. The Regents formally approved UCR&#x27;s medical school proposal in 2006. Upon its completion in 2013, it was the first new medical school built in California in 40 years.

==Campus==


UCR&#x27;s main campus sits at an elevation of to near Box Springs Mountain, 3 miles (5 km) east of downtown Riverside, 3 miles (5 km) south of neighboring Highgrove, CA, and comprises divided into eastern and western areas by the State Route 60 freeway.

East Campus, occupying approximately , hosts the core cluster of academic buildings and services. The original buildings that formed the earliest kernel of the campus included the UC Citrus Experiment Station, residential buildings, and barn, all of which are still in use. They were designed by Lester H. Hibbard, in association with H.B. Cody. Built by 1917 at a cost of $165,000, the architecture of the major buildings followed the Mission Revival style suggesting the Spanish colonial heritage of Southern California.

Further major construction largely ceased on the site until the groundbreaking for the College of Humanities Arts and Social Sciences (CHASS) in April 1951. A group of five buildings designed by different architects in a decidedly more Modern style were completed by 1954: the Rivera Library, Webber Hall, Geology Building, Physical Education Building and Watkins Hall. After the Regents declared UCR a &quot;general campus&quot; of the UC system in 1958, many new buildings and additions were laid out over the following decade. Following an east–west axis, new student residence halls and athletic facilities were developed along the southeastern quadrant of the main campus, while academic and research facilities were built along the central campus area closer to the freeway. The Bell Tower, one of only five carillons in California, was built in this period. Designed by A. Quincy Jones, the tower is tall and contains 48 bells, each weighing from to , covering four chromatic octaves.


After the drop in enrollment and subsequent restructuring of academic programs in the 1970s, little capacity construction was undertaken over the next two decades. However, enrollment growth in the late 1980s justified considerable further campus expansion over the 1990s. Major additions built in the period include: Bourns Hall, completed in 1995; the Humanities &amp; Social Science building, completed in 1996; and the Science Library, completed in 1998. The Pentland and Stonehaven residence halls were completed in 2000, and the Arts building was completed in 2001. Active construction projects include the &quot;Multidisciplinary Research Building,&quot; new residence halls located east of A-I and ongoing renovations to Pierce Hall. The first phase of a new Commons was completed in 2007, and phase II is in development. Other ongoing projects include a new CHASS Instructional and Research Center and Students Academic Support Services Building. Since 1999, more than $730 million has been invested in construction projects.

Of the of UCR property constituting West Campus, approximately along University Avenue have been developed. These include facilities such as University Extension, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Germplasm Repository, International Village (student housing), Human Resources and Highlander Hall. University Village, a mixed use commercial development, features a movie theater, stores, restaurants, office space, and an apartment complex, along with a parking structure and surface parking. Citrus groves and row crops occupy the remaining stretching northwest to the intersection of Chicago Avenue and Le Conte Drive. Plans for future expansion include converting a portion of these fields into new UCR infrastructure.

The University of California, Riverside has recently united its three downtown arts presentation venues under the umbrella name of the UCR ARTSblock. The ARTSblock is composed of the UCR/California Museum of Photography, The Sweeney Art Gallery, and the Culver Center of the Arts, a media lab and presentation facility. The three institutions reside side by side in the heart of downtown Riverside&#x27;s historic pedestrian mall.

===Palm Desert Graduate Center===
The Richard J. Heckmann International Center for Entrepreneurial Management was founded in Palm Desert in 2001. After the Coachella Valley Agricultural Research Station, it is UCR&#x27;s second institutional presence in the Coachella Valley. Initially by a $6 million gift from Richard J. Heckmann, a water treatment entrepreneur, the institution was planned as a teaching and research center of the A. Gary Anderson Graduate School of Management at the UCR School of Business. The center encourages local entrepreneurship through the Coachella Valley Angel Network, an angel investment network. A further investment of $10 million from the State of California and a donation of of land from the City of Palm Desert allowed for the opening of an expanded graduate center on April 15, 2005, adjacent to the California State University, San Bernardino Palm Desert Campus. The center is also home to university researchers in conservation biology, technology transfer and Native American studies. Master&#x27;s level instruction in business management and creative writing is available at the center.

==Academics==


As a campus of the University of California system, UCR is governed by a Board of Regents and administered by a president. The current president is Michael V. Drake, and the current chancellor of the university is Kim A. Wilcox. UCR&#x27;s academic policies are set by its Academic Senate, a legislative body composed of all UCR faculty members.

UCR is organized into three academic colleges, two professional schools, and two graduate schools. UCR&#x27;s liberal arts college, the College of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences, was founded in 1954, and began accepting graduate students in 1960. The College of Natural and Agricultural Sciences, founded in 1958, incorporated the CES as part of the first research-oriented institution at UCR; it eventually also incorporated the natural science departments formerly associated with the liberal arts college to form its present structure in 1974. UCR&#x27;s newest academic unit, the Bourns College of Engineering, was founded in 1989. Comprising the professional schools are the Graduate School of Education, founded in 1968, and the UCR School of Business, founded in 1970. These units collectively provide 81 majors and 52 minors, 48 master&#x27;s degree programs, and 42 Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) programs. UCR is the only UC campus to offer undergraduate degrees in creative writing and public policy and one of three UCs (along with Berkeley and Irvine) to offer an undergraduate degree in business administration. Through its Division of Biomedical Sciences, founded in 1974, UCR offers the Thomas Haider medical degree program in collaboration with UCLA. UCR&#x27;s doctoral program in the emerging field of dance theory, founded in 1992, was the first program of its kind in the United States, and UCR&#x27;s minor in lesbian, gay and bisexual studies, established in 1996, was the first undergraduate program of its kind in the UC system. A new BA program in bagpipes was inaugurated in 2007.

===Rankings===




Institutional rankings of UC Riverside vary widely, depending on the criteria of the publication. For instance, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; has named UC Riverside the top university in the nation for social mobility in 2024, 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019. In the 2025 edition of &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;&#x27;s &quot;America&#x27;s Best Colleges&quot;, UCR was ranked tied for 76th among national universities, 36th among public schools, and 1st for social mobility (5th year in a row); criteria include professor peer assessment, student selectivity and retention, as well as faculty resources, financial resources, and alumni giving. In the 2020 edition of the &quot;Washington Monthly&quot; college rankings, UCR ranked 27th among national universities. &quot;Washington Monthly&quot; assesses the quality of schools based on social mobility (recruiting and graduating low-income students), research (producing cutting-edge scholarship and PhDs), and service (encouraging students to give something back to their country). In the 2021 edition of &quot;Webometrics Ranking of World Universities&quot; based in Spain, UCR was ranked 67th among national universities and 132nd among world universities. &quot;Money&quot; magazine ranked UC Riverside 48th in the country out of the nearly 1500 schools it evaluated for its 2020 Best Colleges ranking. According to the Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index published by &quot;Academic Analytics&quot; in 2006, UCR as an institution ranked 46th among top research universities considering such criteria as faculty publications, citations, research funding and other honors. Since 1997, more than 110 UCR faculty members have been elected fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Over the course of UCR&#x27;s history, seven current or former faculty members have been elected to the National Academy of Sciences, and more than 50 have received Guggenheim Fellowships. UCR currently has two Nobel laureates on its faculty.

=== Historical rankings ===
===Research and economic impact===
UCR operated under a $727 million budget in fiscal year 2014–15. The state government provided $214 million, student fees accounted for $224 million and $100 million came from contracts and grants. Private support and other sources accounted for the remaining $189 million. Overall, monies spent at UCR have an economic impact of nearly $1 billion in California. UCR research expenditure in FY 2018 totaled $167.8 million. Total research expenditures at Riverside are significantly concentrated in agricultural science, accounting for 53% of total research expenditures spent by the university in 2002. Top research centers by expenditure, as measured in 2002, include the Agricultural Experiment Station, the Center for Environmental Research and Technology, the Center for Bibliographical Studies, the Air Pollution Research Center, and the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics.

Throughout UCR&#x27;s history, researchers have developed more than 40 new citrus varieties and invented new techniques to help the $960 million-a-year California citrus industry fight pests and diseases. In 1927, entomologists at the CES introduced two wasps from Australia as natural enemies of a major citrus pest, the citrophilus mealybug, saving growers in Orange County $1 million in annual losses. This event was pivotal in establishing biological control as a practical means of reducing pest populations. In 1963, plant physiologist Charles Coggins proved that application of gibberellic acid allows fruit to remain on citrus trees for extended periods. The ultimate result of his work, which continued through the 1980s, was the extension of the citrus-growing season in California from four to nine months. In 1980, UC Riverside released the Oroblanco grapefruit, its first patented citrus variety. Since then, the citrus breeding program has released other varieties such as the Melogold grapefruit, the Gold Nugget mandarin (or tangerine), and others that have yet to be given trademark names.

To assist entrepreneurs in developing new products, UCR is a primary partner in the Riverside Regional Technology Park, which includes the City of Riverside and the County of Riverside. It also administers six reserves of the University of California Natural Reserve System. UCR recently announced a partnership with China Agricultural University to launch a new center in Beijing, which will study ways to respond to the country&#x27;s growing environmental issues. UCR can also boast the birthplace of two name reactions in organic chemistry, the Castro-Stephens coupling and the Midland Alpine Borane Reduction.

===Admissions and enrollment===
Admission to UC Riverside is rated as &quot;more selective&quot; by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;.

For Fall 2018, UCR received 49,079 freshmen applications; 24,820 were admitted (50.6%). The average GPA of the enrolled freshmen was 3.83, while the average SAT scores were 620 for reading &amp; writing and 635 for math.

In 2006, 43.4 percent of admitted students were first generation college students, 38.7 percent came from low family income backgrounds, and 24 percent graduated from low-performing high schools as measured by Academic Performance Index (API) scores. In 2007, &quot;U.S. News&quot; ranked UCR as the third most ethnically diverse and, by the number of undergraduates receiving Pell Grants (42 percent), the 15th most economically diverse student body in the nation.

According to statistics released by the Education Trust, a national nonprofit, in 2005 UC Riverside graduated 65.3 percent of its students in six years, a figure consistent with national averages but behind the average set by the top five public research universities by as much as 22 percent. However, UCR&#x27;s consistency with the national average is well above the median of 39 percent for low-income-serving institutions as calculated in 2006 by the National Center for Education Statistics, making the campus a model for successful approaches to diversity in higher education.

==Libraries and collections==

Total library collections at UCR comprise more than 2 million volumes, 14,017 electronic journals, 23,000 serial subscriptions, and 1.7 million microformats. Two large, four-story libraries house most of the physical collections. The Rivera library was constructed in 1954 and named after Tomás Rivera in 1985. It seats a capacity of 956 and houses general humanities and social science collections, as well as special collections, including the world&#x27;s largest collection of science fiction, horror and fantasy literature, the 110,000-volume Eaton Collection. The Rivera Library also hosts the only U.S. Patent and Trademark Depository based on a UC campus. The Raymond L. Orbach Science Library, built in 1998, seats a capacity of 1,360 and houses 533,000 volumes in the physical, natural, agricultural, biomedical, engineering and computer sciences, with special strengths in the areas of citrus and sub-tropical horticulture, entomology, and arid lands agriculture. On November 3, 2009, the Science library was officially renamed the Raymond L. Orbach Science Library in honor of former Chancellor Raymond L. Orbach. Smaller libraries include the Media and Cultural Library, the Music Library, and a branch digital library in Palm Desert. The UCR Library is one of 116 members of the Association of Research Libraries, and is ranked 93rd in this group.

UCR&#x27;s academic colleges administer significant museum collections in the arts and sciences. The Citrus Variety Collection constitutes 1,800 trees representing two of each of the 640 types of citrus and 28 other related genera in the family Rutaceae, the largest such collection in the world. The Herbarium houses more than 110,000 dried plant specimens from across the Western hemisphere. UCR is also home to of botanical gardens containing more than 3,500 plant species from around the world. The Gardens are located in the eastern foothills of the Box Springs Mountain on the University of California, Riverside campus. Over four miles (6 km) of trails wind through many microclimates and hilly terrain.

The Entomology Research Museum contains more than three million insect specimens, with particular strengths in Hymenoptera, Chalcidoidea, Aphelinidae, Thysanoptera and Meloidae. The UCR/California Museum of Photography and Sweeney Art Gallery house UCR&#x27;s primary art collections. The UCR/CMP includes the world&#x27;s largest holding of vintage stereographs, one of the three great public collections of photographic apparatus in the US, and the University Print Collection of contemporary and historical images by over 1000 photographers. Located adjacent to the UCR/CMP, the Sweeney Art Gallery holds approximately 650 unique works, with especially strong collections from the modern to contemporary periods, including pieces by Alexander Calder, Roy Lichtenstein, Millard Sheets and Kara Walker.

==Student life==
Riverside enrolls the highest percentage of African American students of any of the 10 UC campuses and the second highest percentage of Latino students after Merced, prompting the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and &quot;New York Times&quot; to run stories stating that UCR is a &quot;campus of choice&quot; for minority students. UCR was the first college in California to open a staffed lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) resource center in 1993, the first UC campus to offer an LGBT minor studies program in 1996, and the first campus in the nation to offer a gender-neutral housing option in 2005. In recognition of this, &quot;The Advocate&quot; recognized UCR as one of the nation&#x27;s best campuses for LGBT students in 2006, although it did not make the top 20. The &quot;Princeton Review&quot; listed UCR as a &quot;Best Western College.&quot; While over 83 percent of students are non-white, there is a tendency for the different ethnic groups to self-segregate.

===Housing===


UCR&#x27;s residence halls consist of four structures—Aberdeen-Inverness, Dundee, Lothian, and Pentland Hills—which can house over 3,000 students in single, double, and triple rooms. In addition, UCR features several on-campus apartment complexes such as Stonehaven, Bannockburn Village, University Plaza, Falkirk, Oban, Glen Mor and International Village, which together house 959 students. Oban has since been upgraded to accommodate family housing following the demolition of Canyon Crest. Glen Mor, an apartment housing complex adjacent to Pentland Hills, was opened in 2007, and the university also purchased a nearby apartment complex, which is now known as Falkirk, for student housing in 2007. About half of the student population lives in off-campus apartments, one-fourth commute, and one-fourth live on campus. Thirty percent of students remain on campus for the weekend.

Reflecting UCR&#x27;s diversity, a number of residence halls have been established for specific social, cultural and academic needs. Ethnic and gender-oriented theme halls include &quot;Unete a Mundo&quot;, for students seeking to support Latino or Chicano students in acclimating to life at UCR; a Pan African Theme Hall for students interested in developing consciousness of African culture in relation to other cultures of the world; and Stonewall Hall, dedicated to students of all gender identities and sexual orientations who wish to live in a gender-neutral community. UCR&#x27;s three academic colleges in the humanities, sciences and engineering fields are represented by respective theme halls, and halls exist for honor students and transfer students.

In Fall 2018, UCR began construction of a new residence hall and dining facility in the parking lot behind Aberdeen-Inverness. This new residence hall and dining facility opened as Dundee-Glasgow in 2020, and features UCR&#x27;s first two-story residential restaurant.

===Student organizations and activities===
UCR hosts over 500 registered student organizations, including the Associated Students of the University of California, Riverside (ASUCR), which represents undergraduates on administrative and policy issues. ASUCR is guided by a Senate composed of 16 elected senators, who represent the three undergraduate colleges in proportion to their enrollment, 5 Executive Cabinet Officers (President, Executive Vice President, Vice President of Campus Internal Affairs, Vice President of External Affairs, and Vice President of Finance), and 6 Directors, who are in charge of the various parts of ASUCR, and a Judicial Council of 6, which adjudicates any cases involving personnel misconduct or interpretation of the Constitution. Membership is composed of all UCR students who pay mandatory activity fees. ASUCR assesses these fees and distributes funds to registered student groups on campus, including student lobbying groups, a right that ASUCR won in a federal court case against the Regents in 1999.

Of the registered student groups, 40 are fraternities and sororities. Nine men&#x27;s fraternities belong to the North American Interfraternity Conference; seven women&#x27;s sororities belong to the National Panhellenic Conference; seven men&#x27;s fraternities and ten women&#x27;s sororities represent the National Multicultural Greek Council, and two others fall under the campus Raza Assembly and are unique to UCR. Thirteen percent of the undergraduate student body participates in Greek life, although chapter houses are not permitted. Including the Greek letter organizations, more than 60 student volunteer service organizations at UCR contribute to more than 100,000 hours of collective and individual service done in the community each year. Jewish student life has existed for over a decade through UCR Hillel.

Student media organizations include &quot;The Highlander&quot; student newspaper, currently published every Tuesday during the academic year. First published in 1954, &quot;The Highlander&quot; remains an independent student media outlet. It was an entirely self-funded organization until 2001, when ASUCR passed a funding referendum for it. Student fees from the referendum go towards overhead and printing costs, however &quot;The Highlander&quot; is primarily funded through its own advertising revenue. In 2003, &quot;The Highlander&quot; published a comic depicting a stereotypical Asian American graduate teaching assistant with poor English skills, inciting community backlash and prompting an apology from Editor-in-Chief Kahlil Ford. Other student news publications on campus include the &quot;Asian Community Times, Indian Time, Nuestra Cosa, Queeriosity&quot;, and the &quot;X-Factor Student Newspaper&quot;. Campus literary magazines include &quot;Mosaic&quot;, published at UCR since 1959, and &quot;Crate,&quot; published by graduate students in UCR&#x27;s master&#x27;s level creative writing program since 2005. UCR broadcasts over radio as KUCR at 88.3 FM. The station programs a variety of independent music, news and commentary.

On-campus entertainment events are planned by a 14-member Associated Students Program Board (ASPB), comprising six student-run divisions that include concerts, films and lectures, cultural events and special events, as well as a marketing and leadership division. ASPB&#x27;s major events include the Block Party Concert, Winter Soulstice, Homecoming Bonfire and Spring Splash.

The Graduate Student Association of the University of California, Riverside (GSAUCR) is ASUCR&#x27;s counterpart on the graduate level. It is guided by a Graduate Student Council consisting of representatives from every department on campus. GSAUCR assesses fees required of all graduate students and uses them to fund research awards and colloquiums, conference travel grants, and speaker funds.

===Athletics===

UCR&#x27;s varsity teams compete in the Big West Conference of NCAA Division I. Programs include men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer, cross country, basketball, track and field, baseball, softball, tennis, golf and women&#x27;s volleyball. After students voted to assess themselves $35 a quarter to fund the athletic programs in 1998, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer and golf were added, and the athletic department switched from NCAA Division II in 2000. While at Division II level, UCR produced 5 national championship teams in men&#x27;s baseball and women&#x27;s volleyball. , UCR had produced 17 individual national champions, 175 All-Americans and many conference and regional champions. The men&#x27;s golf team represented UCR in the 2004 and 2005 NCAA West Regionals after winning back-to-back Conference Championships in those respective years while having three athletes ranked in the top 100 in the country. In 2006, 2007, and 2010 the UCR women&#x27;s basketball team represented the conference in the Division I tournament but lost all three times in the first round. In December 2008, the UCR women&#x27;s basketball team upset the #16-seeded Vanderbilt Commodores.

In 2005 the women&#x27;s soccer team competed in the first round of the NCAA tournament. In 2007, UCR&#x27;s baseball team won their first Big West championship and reached the Division I postseason for the second time since 2003, and the cross country team sent its first two athletes to the national championships.
Football was played until 1975, and the team won two CCAA championships before the sport was discontinued because of low attendance and in anticipation of the impact of Title IX regulations.

The volleyball and basketball teams play home games in the Student Recreation Center Arena (SRC), which seats 3,168. The baseball team competes at the Riverside Sports Complex. UCR graduate Troy Percival personally built UCR&#x27;s baseball clubhouse to major league quality standards. Softball is played at the Amy S. Harrison Field, named after a UCR graduate who donated $300,000 towards its upgrade in 2004. Adjacent to the softball field are the soccer and track fields. The soccer field was resurfaced with artificial turf in 2007. In 2011, the old track and field facility, which had bleachers that dated back to the 1950s and a track surface that was over 15 years old, was completely torn out and replaced with a brand new facility.

Non-varsity student sports clubs that compete with other area universities include the Rugby Football Club, established in 2006, which plays in the Southern California Rugby Football Union. The karate program is provided through the UC Riverside Recreation Center&#x27;s Leisure Line classes. The classes are provided by top-of-the-line USA Shotokan karate team coaches from the American JKA Karate Association, an association that has been in the city for over 40 years. It is one of the largest collegiate programs in the United States, that take competitors to local, national and international competitions. A Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Club Soccer team also competes in the West Coast Soccer Association.

UCR also has a boxing club called Highlander Gloves, which competes in the USIBA College National Championships. Highlander Gloves trains at a local gym named the Raincross Boxing Academy that was founded by a member of Highlander Gloves. UCR&#x27;s Highlander Gloves has produced numerous national champions and consistently ranks within the top five schools in the USIBA National Championships. The club was founded by UC Riverside student Celia Miranda in partnership with Det. Mario Dorado of the Riverside Police Foundation to create a free non-profit program that provides tutoring and mentorship to at-risk students in the Riverside area. This program operates independently of the university, as the gym is located off-campus. Raincross Boxing academy has notably been the home for numerous notable fighters including World title challengers Josesito López, Chris Arreola and Ricardo Rafael Sandoval.

In 1954, UCR&#x27;s founding class adopted the name &quot;Highlanders&quot;, reflecting the campus&#x27; high altitude. After the student body passed a referendum to move to Division I competition in 1998, the bear mascot, formerly called &quot;Scotty&quot;, was professionally redesigned to look more ferocious. The new mascot featured a half-blue face in homage to William Wallace, the subject of the movie Braveheart. In line with the Scottish motif, UCR assembles a bagpipe band made up of students and staff who play at graduation and other campus events. The blue and gold tartan worn by the pipe band and the mascot is a registered trademark of the University of California. For the women&#x27;s basketball team&#x27;s first appearance at the NCAA Tournament in 2006, UCR sent 22 members of the pipe band to play at halftime.

<doc id="230318" wikidata="Q4851239" url="?curid=230318" title="Ball bonding">
<text>Ball bonding is a type of wire bonding, and is the most common way to make the electrical interconnections between a bare silicon die and the lead frame of the package it is placed in during semiconductor device fabrication.

Gold or copper wire can be used, though gold is more common because its oxide is not as problematic in making a weld. If copper wire is used, nitrogen must be used as a cover gas to prevent the copper oxides from forming during the wire bonding process. Copper is also harder than gold, which makes damage to the surface of the chip more likely. However copper is cheaper than gold and has superior electrical properties, and so remains a compelling choice.

Almost all modern ball bonding processes use a combination of heat, pressure, and ultrasonic energy to make a weld at each end of the wire. The wire used can be as small as 15 μm in diameter—such that several welds could fit across the width of a human hair.

A person upon first seeing a ball bonder will usually compare its operation to that of a sewing machine. In fact there is a needle-like disposable tool called the &quot;capillary&quot;, through which the wire is fed. A high-voltage electric charge is applied to the wire. This melts the wire at the tip of the capillary. The tip of the wire forms into a ball because of the surface tension of the molten metal.
The ball quickly solidifies, and the capillary is lowered to the surface of the chip, which is typically heated to at least 125 °C. The machine then pushes down on the capillary and applies ultrasonic energy with an attached transducer. The combined heat, pressure, and ultrasonic energy create a weld between the copper or gold ball and the surface of the chip—which is usually copper or aluminum. This is the so-called &quot;ball bond&quot; that gives the process its name. (All-aluminum systems in semiconductor fabrication eliminate the &quot;purple plague&quot;—a brittle gold-aluminum intermetallic compound—sometimes associated with pure gold bonding wire. This property makes aluminum ideal for ultrasonic bonding.) 

Next the wire is passed out through the capillary and the machine moves over a few millimeters to the location that the chip needs to be wired up to (usually called the &quot;leadframe&quot;). The machine again descends to the surface, this time without making a ball so that the wire is crushed between the leadframe and the tip of the capillary. This time the surface is usually gold, palladium, or silver—but the weld is made in the same way. The resulting weld is quite different in appearance from the ball bond, and is referred to as the &quot;wedge bond&quot;, &quot;tail bond&quot;, or simply as the &quot;second bond&quot;.

In the final step the machine pays out a small length of wire and tears the wire from the surface using a set of clamps. This leaves a small &quot;tail&quot; of wire hanging from the end of the capillary. The cycle then starts again with the high-voltage electric charge being applied to this tail.

The process where wire is cut right after ball is formed is also called &quot;stud bumping&quot;. Stud bumping is used when stacking chips in system in package (SIP) modules.

The current state-of-the-art machines () can repeat this cycle about 20 times per second. A modern ball bonder is fully automatic and is essentially a self-sufficient industrial robot, complete with a vision system, sensors, and complex servo systems.

== Ball bonding transducer ==
Piezoelectric transducers are used to provide ultrasonic energy in the ball bonding process. These transducers are known as bolt-clamped transducers or Langevin transducers. They consist of metal components and piezoelectric elements, all held together by a bolt. These transducers operate at their resonant frequency of lateral vibration to introduce lateral ultrasonic excitation to the capillary. Along the lateral direction of the transducer, there exists nodal points (large displacement) and antinodal points (no displacement). Piezoelectric elements expand and contract upon alternating voltage excitation (which will be at the resonance frequency), thereby exciting resonance vibration in the structure. Usually, a few elements are stacked in order to increase the electric field for an applied voltage (stress is generated proportional to electric field). In order to maximize the energy transfer from the piezoelectric element to the structure, they are placed at nodes, which are high strain and high stress regions. At the same time, in order to minimize energy loss to the surroundings, the transducer is held at an antinode (no displacement).At the front end of the transducer a tapered horn is used to magnify the vibration. Different tapering profiles can be used to get the desired result, such as a linear taper or parabolic taper. The horn&#x27;s taper reduces the cross-sectional area, causing a larger ultrasonic energy density, then leading to more displacement near the tip. The capillary is placed near the tip for this reason. Higher order bending modes are excited in the capillary, which are quite unideal. In order to mitigate this effect, the capillary clamping position is adjusted to an antinode of the capillary. Ideally, the capillary would be short, but this is not possible because the bond needs to be made in hard to reach areas. 

The bolt clamps the whole structure together by screwing into the horn (depending on the configuration). Correct preload needs to be administered in order to optimize performance. Piezo ceramics are weak under tension; therefore, a large preload will ensure the ceramics will operate mostly in compression due to the bias stress.

<doc id="230319" wikidata="Q49974" url="?curid=230319" title="Hardy–Weinberg principle">
<text>In population genetics, the Hardy–Weinberg principle, also known as the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, model, theorem, or law, states that allele and genotype frequencies in a population will remain constant from generation to generation in the absence of other evolutionary influences. These influences include &quot;genetic drift&quot;, &quot;mate choice&quot;, &quot;assortative mating&quot;, &quot;natural selection&quot;, &quot;sexual selection&quot;, &quot;mutation&quot;, &quot;gene flow&quot;, &quot;meiotic drive&quot;, &quot;genetic hitchhiking&quot;, &quot;population bottleneck&quot;, &quot;founder effect,&quot; &quot;inbreeding and outbreeding depression&quot;.

In the simplest case of a single locus with two alleles denoted &quot;A&quot; and &quot;a&quot; with frequencies and , respectively, the expected genotype frequencies under random mating are for the AA homozygotes, for the aa homozygotes, and for the heterozygotes. In the absence of selection, mutation, genetic drift, or other forces, allele frequencies &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; are constant between generations, so equilibrium is reached.

The principle is named after G. H. Hardy and Wilhelm Weinberg, who first demonstrated it mathematically. Hardy&#x27;s paper was focused on debunking the view that a dominant allele would automatically tend to increase in frequency (a view possibly based on a misinterpreted question at a lecture). Today, tests for Hardy–Weinberg genotype frequencies are used primarily to test for population stratification and other forms of non-random mating.

== Derivation ==
Consider a population of monoecious diploids, where each organism produces male and female gametes at equal frequency, and has two alleles at each gene locus. We assume that the population is so large that it can be treated as infinite. Organisms reproduce by random union of gametes (the &quot;gene pool&quot; population model). A locus in this population has two alleles, A and a, that occur with initial frequencies and , respectively. The allele frequencies at each generation are obtained by pooling together the alleles from each genotype of the same generation according to the expected contribution from the homozygote and heterozygote genotypes, which are 1 and 1/2, respectively:


The different ways to form genotypes for the next generation can be shown in a Punnett square, where the proportion of each genotype is equal to the product of the row and column allele frequencies from the current generation.

The sum of the entries is , as the genotype frequencies must sum to one.

Note again that as , the binomial expansion of gives the same relationships.

Summing the elements of the Punnett square or the binomial expansion, we obtain the expected genotype proportions among the offspring after a single generation:


These frequencies define the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. It should be mentioned that the genotype frequencies after the first generation need not equal the genotype frequencies from the initial generation, e.g. . However, the genotype frequencies for all &quot;future&quot; times will equal the Hardy–Weinberg frequencies, e.g. for . This follows since the genotype frequencies of the next generation depend only on the allele frequencies of the current generation which, as calculated by equations () and (), are preserved from the initial generation:

: formula_1

For the more general case of dioecious diploids [organisms are either male or female] that reproduce by random mating of individuals, it is necessary to calculate the genotype frequencies from the nine possible matings between each parental genotype (&quot;AA&quot;, &quot;Aa&quot;, and &quot;aa&quot;) in either sex, weighted by the expected genotype contributions of each such mating. Equivalently, one considers the six unique diploid-diploid combinations:

: formula_2

and constructs a Punnett square for each, so as to calculate its contribution to the next generation&#x27;s genotypes. These contributions are weighted according to the probability of each diploid-diploid combination, which follows a multinomial distribution with . For example, the probability of the mating combination is and it can only result in the genotype: . Overall, the resulting genotype frequencies are calculated as:

: formula_3

As before, one can show that the allele frequencies at time equal those at time , and so, are constant in time. Similarly, the genotype frequencies depend only on the allele frequencies, and so, after time are also constant in time.

If in either monoecious or dioecious organisms, either the allele or genotype proportions are initially unequal in either sex, it can be shown that constant proportions are obtained after one generation of random mating. If dioecious organisms are heterogametic and the gene locus is located on the X chromosome, it can be shown that if the allele frequencies are initially unequal in the two sexes [&quot;e.g&quot;., XX females and XY males, as in humans], in the heterogametic sex &#x27;chases&#x27; in the homogametic sex of the previous generation, until an equilibrium is reached at the weighted average of the two initial frequencies.

== Deviations from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium ==
The seven assumptions underlying Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium are as follows:
* organisms are diploid
* only sexual reproduction occurs
* generations are nonoverlapping
* mating is random
* population size is infinitely large
* allele frequencies are equal in the sexes
* there is no migration, gene flow, admixture, mutation or selection

Violations of the Hardy–Weinberg assumptions can cause deviations from expectation. How this affects the population depends on the assumptions that are violated.

* Random mating. The HWP states the population will have the given genotypic frequencies (called Hardy–Weinberg proportions) after a single generation of random mating within the population. When the random mating assumption is violated, the population will not have Hardy–Weinberg proportions. A common cause of non-random mating is inbreeding, which causes an increase in homozygosity for all genes.

If a population violates one of the following four assumptions, the population may continue to have Hardy–Weinberg proportions each generation, but the allele frequencies will change over time.

* Selection, in general, causes allele frequencies to change, often quite rapidly. While directional selection eventually leads to the loss of all alleles except the favored one (unless one allele is dominant, in which case recessive alleles can survive at low frequencies), some forms of selection, such as balancing selection, lead to equilibrium without loss of alleles.
* Mutation will have a very subtle effect on allele frequencies through the introduction of new allele into a population. Mutation rates are of the order 10−4 to 10−8, and the change in allele frequency will be, at most, the same order. Recurrent mutation will maintain alleles in the population, even if there is strong selection against them.
* Migration genetically links two or more populations together. In general, allele frequencies will become more homogeneous among the populations. Some models for migration inherently include nonrandom mating (Wahlund effect, for example). For those models, the Hardy–Weinberg proportions will normally not be valid.
* Small population size can cause a random change in allele frequencies. This is due to a sampling effect, and is called genetic drift. Sampling effects are most important when the allele is present in a small number of copies.
In real world genotype data, deviations from Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium may be a sign of genotyping error.

== Sex linkage ==
Where the A gene is sex linked, the heterogametic sex (&quot;e.g.&quot;, mammalian males; avian females) have only one copy of the gene (and are termed hemizygous), while the homogametic sex (&quot;e.g.&quot;, human females) have two copies. The genotype frequencies at equilibrium are &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; for the heterogametic sex but &quot;p&quot;2, 2&quot;pq&quot; and &quot;q&quot;2 for the homogametic sex.

For example, in humans red–green colorblindness is an X-linked recessive trait. In western European males, the trait affects about 1 in 12, (&quot;q&quot; = 0.083) whereas it affects about 1 in 200 females (0.005, compared to &quot;q&quot;2 = 0.007), very close to Hardy–Weinberg proportions.

If a population is brought together with males and females with a different allele frequency in each subpopulation (males or females), the allele frequency of the male population in the next generation will follow that of the female population because each son receives its X chromosome from its mother. The population converges on equilibrium very quickly.

== Generalizations ==
The simple derivation above can be generalized for more than two alleles and polyploidy.

=== Generalization for more than two alleles ===

Consider an extra allele frequency, &quot;r&quot;. The two-allele case is the binomial expansion of (&quot;p&quot; + &quot;q&quot;)2, and thus the three-allele case is the trinomial expansion of (&quot;p&quot; + &quot;q&quot; + &quot;r&quot;)2.

:formula_4

More generally, consider the alleles A1, ..., A&quot;n&quot; given by the allele frequencies &quot;p&quot;1 to &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;;

:formula_5

giving for all homozygotes:

:formula_6

and for all heterozygotes:

:formula_7

=== Generalization for polyploidy ===
The Hardy–Weinberg principle may also be generalized to polyploid systems, that is, for organisms that have more than two copies of each chromosome. Consider again only two alleles. The diploid case is the binomial expansion of:

:formula_8

and therefore the polyploid case is the binomial expansion of:

:formula_9

where &quot;c&quot; is the ploidy, for example with tetraploid (&quot;c&quot; = 4):

Whether the organism is a &#x27;true&#x27; tetraploid or an amphidiploid will determine how long it will take for the population to reach Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium.

=== Complete generalization ===
For formula_10 distinct alleles in formula_11-ploids, the genotype frequencies in the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium are given by individual terms in the multinomial expansion of formula_12:

:formula_13

== Significance tests for deviation ==
Testing deviation from the HWP is generally performed using Pearson&#x27;s chi-squared test, using the observed genotype frequencies obtained from the data and the expected genotype frequencies obtained using the HWP. For systems where there are large numbers of alleles, this may result in data with many empty possible genotypes and low genotype counts, because there are often not enough individuals present in the sample to adequately represent all genotype classes. If this is the case, then the asymptotic assumption of the chi-squared distribution, will no longer hold, and it may be necessary to use a form of Fisher&#x27;s exact test, which requires a computer to solve. More recently a number of MCMC methods of testing for deviations from HWP have been proposed (Guo &amp; Thompson, 1992; Wigginton &quot;et al.&quot; 2005)

=== Example chi-squared test for deviation ===
This data is from E. B. Ford (1971) on the scarlet tiger moth, for which the phenotypes of a sample of the population were recorded. Genotype–phenotype distinction is assumed to be negligibly small. The null hypothesis is that the population is in Hardy–Weinberg proportions, and the alternative hypothesis is that the population is not in Hardy–Weinberg proportions.

From this, allele frequencies can be calculated:

: formula_14

and

: formula_15

So the Hardy–Weinberg expectation is:

: formula_16

Pearson&#x27;s chi-squared test states:

: formula_17

There is 1 degree of freedom (degrees of freedom for test for Hardy–Weinberg proportions are # genotypes − # alleles). The 5% significance level for 1 degree of freedom is 3.84, and since the χ2 value is less than this, the null hypothesis that the population is in Hardy–Weinberg frequencies is not rejected.

=== Fisher&#x27;s exact test (probability test) ===
Fisher&#x27;s exact test can be applied to testing for Hardy–Weinberg proportions. Since the test is conditional on the allele frequencies, &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot;, the problem can be viewed as testing for the proper number of heterozygotes. In this way, the hypothesis of Hardy–Weinberg proportions is rejected if the number of heterozygotes is too large or too small. The conditional probabilities for the heterozygote, given the allele frequencies are given in Emigh (1980) as
:formula_18
where &quot;n&quot;11, &quot;n&quot;12, &quot;n&quot;22 are the observed numbers of the three genotypes, AA, Aa, and aa, respectively, and &quot;n&quot;1 is the number of A alleles, where formula_19.

An example
Using one of the examples from Emigh (1980), we can consider the case where &quot;n&quot; = 100, and &quot;p&quot; = 0.34. The possible observed heterozygotes and their exact significance level is given in Table 4.
Using this table, one must look up the significance level of the test based on the observed number of heterozygotes. For example, if one observed 20 heterozygotes, the significance level for the test is 0.007. As is typical for Fisher&#x27;s exact test for small samples, the gradation of significance levels is quite coarse.

However, a table like this has to be created for every experiment, since the tables are dependent on both &quot;n&quot; and &quot;p&quot;.

== Equivalence tests ==
The equivalence tests are developed in order to establish sufficiently good agreement of the observed genotype frequencies and Hardy Weinberg equilibrium. Let formula_20 denote the family of the genotype distributions under the assumption of Hardy Weinberg equilibrium. The distance between a genotype distribution formula_21 and Hardy Weinberg equilibrium is defined by formula_22, where formula_23 is some distance. The equivalence test problem is given by formula_24 and formula_25, where formula_26 is a tolerance parameter. If the hypothesis formula_27 can be rejected then the population is close to Hardy Weinberg equilibrium with a high probability. The equivalence tests for the biallelic case are developed among others in Wellek (2004). The equivalence tests for the case of multiple alleles are proposed in Ostrovski (2020).

==Inbreeding coefficient==
The inbreeding coefficient, formula_28 (see also &quot;F&quot;-statistics), is one minus the observed frequency of heterozygotes over that expected from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium.

where the expected value from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium is given by

:formula_29

For example, for Ford&#x27;s data above:

For two alleles, the chi-squared goodness of fit test for Hardy–Weinberg proportions is equivalent to the test for inbreeding, formula_30.

The inbreeding coefficient is unstable as the expected value approaches zero, and thus not useful for rare and very common alleles. For: formula_31; formula_32 is undefined.

==History==
Mendelian genetics were rediscovered in 1900. However, it remained somewhat controversial for several years as it was not then known how it could cause continuous characteristics. Udny Yule (1902) argued against Mendelism because he thought that dominant alleles would increase in the population. The American William E. Castle (1903) showed that without selection, the genotype frequencies would remain stable. Karl Pearson (1903) found one equilibrium position with values of &quot;p&quot; = &quot;q&quot; = 0.5. Reginald Punnett, unable to counter Yule&#x27;s point, introduced the problem to G. H. Hardy, a British mathematician, with whom he played cricket. Hardy was a pure mathematician and held applied mathematics in some contempt; his view of biologists&#x27; use of mathematics comes across in his 1908 paper where he describes this as &quot;very simple&quot;:

:&quot;To the Editor of Science: I am reluctant to intrude in a discussion concerning matters of which I have no expert knowledge, and I should have expected the very simple point which I wish to make to have been familiar to biologists. However, some remarks of Mr. Udny Yule, to which Mr. R. C. Punnett has called my attention, suggest that it may still be worth making...&quot;

:&quot;Suppose that Aa is a pair of Mendelian characters, A being dominant, and that in any given generation the number of pure dominants (AA), heterozygotes (Aa), and pure recessives (aa) are as&quot; &quot;p&quot;:2&quot;q&quot;:&quot;r&quot;. &quot;Finally, suppose that the numbers are fairly large, so that mating may be regarded as random, that the sexes are evenly distributed among the three varieties, and that all are equally fertile. A little mathematics of the multiplication-table type is enough to show that in the next generation the numbers will be as&quot; (&quot;p&quot; + &quot;q&quot;)2:2(&quot;p&quot; + &quot;q&quot;)(&quot;q&quot; + &quot;r&quot;):(&quot;q&quot; + &quot;r&quot;)2, or as &quot;p&quot;1:2&quot;q&quot;1:&quot;r&quot;1, &quot;say.&quot;

:&quot;The interesting question is: in what circumstances will this distribution be the same as that in the generation before? It is easy to see that the condition for this is&quot; &quot;q&quot;2 = &quot;pr&quot;. And since &quot;q&quot;12 = &quot;p&quot;1&quot;r&quot;1, &quot;whatever the values of&quot; &quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;, &quot;and&quot; &quot;r&quot; &quot;may be, the distribution will in any case continue unchanged after the second generation&quot;

The principle was thus known as &quot;Hardy&#x27;s law&quot; in the English-speaking world until 1943, when Curt Stern pointed out that it had first been formulated independently in 1908 by the German physician Wilhelm Weinberg. William Castle in 1903 also derived the ratios for the special case of equal allele frequencies, and it is sometimes (but rarely) called the Hardy–Weinberg–Castle Law.

=== Derivation of Hardy&#x27;s equations ===
Hardy&#x27;s statement begins with a recurrence relation for the frequencies &quot;p&quot;, 2&quot;q&quot;, and &quot;r&quot;. These recurrence relations follow from fundamental concepts in probability, specifically independence, and conditional probability. For example, consider the probability of an offspring from the generation formula_33 being homozygous dominant. Alleles are inherited independently from each parent. A dominant allele can be inherited from a homozygous dominant parent with probability 1, or from a heterozygous parent with probability 0.5. To represent this reasoning in an equation, let formula_34 represent inheritance of a dominant allele from a parent. Furthermore, let formula_35 and formula_36 represent potential parental genotypes in the preceding generation.

: formula_37

The same reasoning, applied to the other genotypes yields the two remaining recurrence relations. Equilibrium occurs when each proportion is constant between subsequent generations. More formally, a population is at equilibrium at generation formula_33 when
: formula_39, formula_40, and formula_41
By solving these equations necessary and sufficient conditions for equilibrium to occur can be determined. Again, consider the frequency of homozygous dominant animals. Equilibrium implies

: formula_42

First consider the case, where formula_43, and note that it implies that formula_44 and formula_45. Now consider the remaining case, where formula_46:

: formula_47

where the final equality holds because the allele proportions must sum to one. In both cases, formula_48. It can be shown that the other two equilibrium conditions imply the same equation. Together, the solutions of the three equilibrium equations imply sufficiency of Hardy&#x27;s condition for equilibrium. Since the condition always holds for the second generation, all succeeding generations have the same proportions.

=== Numerical example ===

==== Estimation of genotype distribution ====
An example computation of the genotype distribution given by Hardy&#x27;s original equations is instructive. The phenotype distribution from Table 3 above will be used to compute Hardy&#x27;s initial genotype distribution. Note that the &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; values used by Hardy are not the same as those used above.

: formula_49

: formula_50

As checks on the distribution, compute
: formula_51

and

: formula_52

For the next generation, Hardy&#x27;s equations give
: formula_53

Again as checks on the distribution, compute

: formula_54

and

: formula_55

which are the expected values. The reader may demonstrate that subsequent use of the second-generation values for a third generation will yield identical results.

==== Estimation of carrier frequency ====

The Hardy–Weinberg principle can also be used to estimate the frequency of carriers of an autosomal recessive condition in a population based on the frequency of suffers.

Let us assume an estimated formula_56 babies are born with cystic fibrosis, this is about the frequency of homozygous individuals observed in Northern European populations. We can use the Hardy–Weinberg equations to estimate the carrier frequency, the frequency of heterozygous individuals, formula_57.

: formula_58

As formula_59 is small we can take &quot;p&quot;, formula_60, to be 1.

: formula_61

We therefore estimate the carrier rate to be formula_62, which is about the frequency observed in Northern European populations.

This can be simplified to the carrier frequency being about twice the square root of the birth frequency.

== Graphical representation ==
It is possible to represent the distribution of genotype frequencies for a bi-allelic locus within a population graphically using a de Finetti diagram. This uses a triangular plot (also known as trilinear, triaxial or ternary plot) to represent the distribution of the three genotype frequencies in relation to each other. It differs from many other such plots in that the direction of one of the axes has been reversed. The curved line in the diagram is the Hardy–Weinberg parabola and represents the state where alleles are in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. It is possible to represent the effects of natural selection and its effect on allele frequency on such graphs. The de Finetti diagram was developed and used extensively by A. W. F. Edwards in his book &quot;Foundations of Mathematical Genetics&quot;.

<text>, born Aisin Gioro Xianyu, was a Qing dynasty princess of the Aisin-Gioro clan. She was raised in Japan and served as a spy for the Japanese Kwantung Army and Manchukuo during the Second Sino-Japanese War. She is sometimes known in fiction under the pseudonym &quot;Eastern Mata Hari&quot;. After the war, she was captured, tried, and executed as a traitor by the Nationalist government of the Republic of China. She was also a notable descendant of Hooge, eldest son of Hong Taiji.

==Names==
She was born in the Aisin-Gioro clan, the imperial clan of the Manchu-led Qing dynasty. Her birth name was Aisin Gioro Xianyu and her courtesy name was Dongzhen (literally &quot;eastern jewel&quot;). Her Sinicised name was Jin Bihui. She is best known by her Japanese name, Kawashima Yoshiko (川島 芳子), which is read as Chuāndǎo Fāngzǐ in Chinese. In 1925, Yoshiko took the male name Ryōsuke.

==Family background and early life==

She was born Aisin Gioro Xianyu in Beijing in 1907 as the 14th daughter of Shanqi (1866–1922), a Manchu prince of the Aisin Gioro clan, the imperial clan of China&#x27;s Qing dynasty. Her mother was Lady Janggiya (), Shanqi&#x27;s fourth concubine. Shanqi was a descendant of Hooge, the eldest son of Hong Taiji (the second ruler of the Qing dynasty). Shanqi was also the tenth heir to the Prince Su peerage, one of the 12 &quot;iron-cap&quot; princely peerages of the Qing dynasty.

After the Xinhai Revolution overthrew the Qing dynasty in 1912, Xianyu was given up for adoption in 1915 at the age of eight to her father&#x27;s friend, Naniwa Kawashima, a Japanese espionage agent and mercenary adventurer. Her adoptive father changed her name to &quot;Yoshiko Kawashima&quot; and took her back to Tokyo, Japan, to be raised and educated in the Kawashima family house. As a teenage girl, Kawashima was sent to school in Tokyo for an education that included judo and fencing.

In 1922, around the time her adoptive family moved to Matsumoto, Kawashima&#x27;s biological father, Shanqi, died. As Kawashima&#x27;s mother had no official identity as Shanqi&#x27;s concubine, she followed Manchu tradition and died by suicide to join Shanqi in death.

On 22 November 1925, Yoshiko said that she had &quot;...decided to cease being a woman forever.&quot; Earlier that day, she had dressed in a kimono with a traditional female hair style and took a photo among blooming cosmos to commemorate &quot;my farewell to life as a woman.&quot; That evening, Yoshiko went to a barbershop and had her hair cut into a crew cut, from then on dressing in men&#x27;s clothes. A photo of the transformation appeared five days later in &quot;the Asahi Shimbun&quot; under the headline: &quot;Kawashima Yoshiko&#x27;s Beautiful Black Hair Completely Cut Off - Because of Unfounded &#x27;Rumors,&#x27; Makes Firm Decision to Become a Man - Touching Secret Tale of Her Shooting Herself&quot;, alluding to a prior episode in which she had shot herself in the chest with a pistol given to her by . 

Several explanations have later been given as to what triggered her decision, including the death of her parents, failed romances or alleged sexual abuse from her foster father.

Kawashima explained in another article two days after the first that &quot;I was born with what the doctors call a tendency toward the third sex, and so I cannot pursue an ordinary woman&#x27;s goals in life... Since I was young I&#x27;ve been dying to do the things that boys do. My impossible dream is to work hard like a man for China, for Asia.&quot;

Earlier in her life, it had been remarked upon that she had &quot;boyish habits&quot; despite her feminine beauty. She would use only the male style of Japanese grammar, even though that contributed to her not being re-admitted to her school after her biological father&#x27;s death.

==Espionage career==
In November 1927 at age 20, her brother and adoptive father arranged for her marriage in Port Arthur (also known as Ryojun) to Ganjuurjab, the son of Inner Mongolian Army general Babojab, who once led the Mongolian-Manchurian Independence Movement there in 1911. The marriage ended in divorce after only three years. She left Mongolia, and she first traveled to teeming coastal towns of China and lived a bohemian lifestyle for some years in Tokyo with a series of rich lovers, both men and women. Kawashima moved to the foreign concession in Shanghai. While in Shanghai, she met Japanese military attaché and intelligence officer Ryukichi Tanaka, who utilised her contacts with the Manchu and Mongol nobility to expand her network. She was living with Tanaka in Shanghai at the time of the Shanghai Incident of 1932.

After Tanaka was recalled to Japan, Kawashima continued to serve as a spy for the general Kenji Doihara. She undertook undercover missions in Manchuria, often in disguise, and was considered &quot;strikingly attractive, with a dominating personality, almost a film-drama figure, half tom-boy and half heroine, and with a passion for dressing up as a male. She possibly did this in order to impress the men, or she may have done it in order to more easily fit into the tightly-knit guerrilla groups without attracting too much attention&quot;.

Kawashima was well-acquainted with Puyi, the last emperor of the Qing dynasty, who regarded her as a member of the imperial family and welcomed her into his household during her stay in Tianjin. It was through this close liaison that Kawashima was able to persuade Puyi to become a figurehead ruler for Manchukuo, a puppet state created by the Japanese in Manchuria. However, Kawashima privately criticised Puyi for being too amenable to Japanese influence.

After Puyi became Emperor of Manchukuo, Kawashima continued to play various roles and, for a time, was a lover of Hayao Tada, the chief military advisor to Puyi. She formed an independent counterinsurgency cavalry force in 1932 made up of 3,000-5,000 former bandits to hunt down anti-Japanese guerrilla bands during the Pacification of Manchukuo, and was hailed in the Japanese newspapers as the Joan of Arc of Manchukuo. In 1933, she offered the unit to the Japanese Kwantung Army for Operation Nekka, but it was refused. The unit continued to exist under her command until sometime in the late 1930s.

Kawashima became a well-known and popular figure in Manchukuo, making appearances on radio broadcasts and even issuing a record of her songs. Numerous fictional and semi-fictional stories of her exploits were published in newspapers and also as pulp fiction. However, her very popularity created issues with the Kwantung Army because her utility as an intelligence asset was long gone, and her value as a propaganda symbol was compromised by her increasingly critical tone against the Japanese military&#x27;s exploitative policies in Manchukuo as a base of operations against China in the Second Sino-Japanese War, and she gradually faded from public sight.

==Capture, trial and execution==
After the end of the war, on 11 November 1945, a news agency reported that &quot;a long sought-for beauty in male costume was arrested in Beijing by counter-intelligence officers&quot;. She was held at Hebei Model Prison.

The Supreme Court of Hebei originally addressed Kawashima as &quot;Chuandao Fangzi&quot; (the Chinese pronunciation of her Japanese name&#x27;s kanji). When her trial began a month later, Kawashima identified herself by her Chinese name, &quot;Jin Bihui&quot;, which eventually became the name court officials used. However, in accordance with her lawyers&#x27; strategy to deflect her charge of treason, she gradually began to emphasise a Japanese or Manchu banner identity. The court rejected the defence&#x27;s bid to have her tried as a war criminal rather than as a domestic traitor, based on a combination of &quot;jus sanguinis&quot; and Kawashima&#x27;s failure to formally renounce her citizenship through China&#x27;s Department of Civil Affairs.

Charged with treason as a &quot;hanjian&quot; on 20 October 1947, she was executed by a bullet shot into the back of her head on 25 March 1948, and her body was later put on public display.

Her body was collected by a Japanese monk to be cremated. Her remains were sent back to her adoptive family and later buried at Shōrinji temple in Matsumoto, Nagano Prefecture, Japan.

<doc id="230322" wikidata="Q466887" url="?curid=230322" title="Belle Époque">
<text>The Belle Époque () or La Belle Époque () was a period of French and European history that began after the end of the Franco-Prussian War in 1871 and continued until the outbreak of World War I in 1914. Occurring during the era of the French Third Republic, it was a period characterised by optimism, enlightenment, romanticism, regional peace, economic prosperity, conservatism, nationalism, colonial expansion, and technological, scientific and cultural innovations. In this era of France&#x27;s cultural and artistic climate (particularly in Paris of that time), the arts markedly flourished, and numerous masterpieces of literature, music, theatre and visual art gained extensive recognition.

The Belle Époque was so named in retrospect, when it began to be considered a continental European &quot;Golden Age&quot; in contrast to the horrors of the Napoleonic Wars and World War I. The Belle Époque was a period in which, according to historian R. R. Palmer, &quot;European civilisation achieved its greatest power in global politics, and also exerted its maximum influence upon peoples outside Europe.&quot;

==Popular culture and fashions==
Two devastating world wars and their aftermath made the Belle Époque appear to be a time of &quot;joie de vivre&quot; (joy of living) in contrast to 19th century hardships. It was also a period of stability that France enjoyed after the tumult of the early years of the Third Republic, featuring defeat in the Franco-Prussian War, the uprising of the Paris Commune, and the fall of General Georges Ernest Boulanger. The defeat of Boulanger, and the celebrations tied to the 1889 World&#x27;s Fair in Paris, launched an era of optimism and affluence. French imperialism was in its prime. It was a cultural center of global influence, its educational, scientific and medical institutions were at the leading edge of Europe.

It was not entirely the reality of life in Paris or in France, however. France had a large economic underclass who never experienced much of the Belle Époque&#x27;s wonders and entertainments. Poverty remained endemic in Paris&#x27;s urban slums and rural peasantry for decades after the Belle Époque ended. Conflicts between the government and the Roman Catholic Church were regular during the period. Some of the artistic elite saw the Fin de siècle in a pessimistic light.
Those who were able to benefit from the prosperity of the era were drawn towards new forms of light entertainment during the Belle Époque, and the Parisian bourgeoisie, or the successful industrialists called the &quot;nouveaux riches&quot;, became increasingly influenced by the habits and fads of the city&#x27;s elite social class, known popularly as &quot;Tout-Paris&quot; (&quot;all of Paris&quot;, or &quot;everyone in Paris&quot;). The Casino de Paris opened in 1890. For Paris&#x27;s less affluent public, entertainment was provided by cabarets, bistros and music halls.

The Moulin Rouge cabaret is a Paris landmark still open for business today. The Folies Bergère was another landmark venue. Burlesque performance styles were more mainstream in Belle Époque Paris than in more staid cities of Europe and America. Liane de Pougy, dancer, socialite and courtesan, was well known in Paris as a headline performer at top cabarets. Belle Époque dancers and singers such as Polaire, Mistinguett, Paulus, Eugénie Fougère, La Goulue and Jane Avril were Paris celebrities, some of whom modelled for Toulouse-Lautrec&#x27;s iconic poster art. The Can-can dance was a popular 19th-century cabaret style that appears in Toulouse-Lautrec&#x27;s posters from the era.

The Eiffel Tower, built to serve as the grand entrance to the 1889 World&#x27;s Fair held in Paris, became the accustomed symbol of the city, to its inhabitants and to visitors from around the world. Paris hosted another successful World&#x27;s Fair in 1900, the . Paris had been profoundly changed by the Second Empire reforms to the city&#x27;s architecture and public amenities. Haussmann&#x27;s renovation of Paris changed its housing, street layouts, and green spaces. The walkable neighbourhoods were well-established by the Belle Époque.

Cheap coal and cheap labour contributed to the cult of the orchid and made possible the perfection of fruits grown under glass, as the apparatus of state dinners extended to the upper classes. Exotic feathers and furs were more prominently featured in fashion than ever before, as &quot;haute couture&quot; was invented in Paris, the center of the Belle Époque, where fashion began to move in a yearly cycle. In Paris, restaurants such as Maxim&#x27;s Paris achieved a new splendor and cachet as places for the rich to parade. Maxim&#x27;s Paris was arguably the city&#x27;s most exclusive restaurant. Bohemian lifestyles gained a different glamour, pursued in the cabarets of Montmartre.

Large public buildings such as the Opéra Garnier devoted enormous spaces to interior designs as Art Nouveau show places. After the mid-19th century, railways linked all the major cities of Europe to spa towns like Biarritz, Deauville, Vichy, Arcachon and the French Riviera. Their carriages were rigorously divided into first-class and second-class, but the super-rich now began to commission private railway coaches, as exclusivity as well as display was a hallmark of opulent luxury.

==Politics==
The years between the Franco-Prussian War and World War I were characterised by unusual political stability in Western and Central Europe. Although tensions between France and Germany persisted as a result of the French loss of Alsace-Lorraine to Germany in 1871, a series of diplomatic conferences managed to mediate disputes that threatened the general peace: the Congress of Berlin in 1878, the Berlin Congo Conference in 1884, and the Algeciras Conference in 1906. Indeed, for many Europeans during the Belle Époque, transnational, class-based affiliations were as important as national identities, particularly among aristocrats. An upper-class gentleman could travel through much of Western Europe without a passport and even reside abroad with minimal bureaucratic regulation. World War I, mass transportation, the spread of literacy, and various citizenship concerns changed this.

The Belle Époque featured a class structure that ensured cheap labour. The Paris Métro underground railway system joined the omnibus and streetcar in transporting the working population, including those servants who did not live in the wealthy centers of cities. One result of this commuting was suburbanisation allowing working-class and upper-class neighbourhoods to be separated by large distances.
Meanwhile, the international workers&#x27; movement also reorganised itself and reinforced pan-European, class-based identities among the classes whose labour supported the Belle Époque. The most notable transnational socialist organisation was the Second International. Anarchists of different affiliations were active during the period leading up to World War I. Political assassinations and assassination attempts were still rare in France (unlike in Russia) but there were some notable exceptions, including the killing of President Marie François Sadi Carnot in 1894. A bomb was detonated in the Chamber of Deputies of France in 1893, causing injuries but no deaths. Terrorism against civilians also occurred in 1894, perpetrated by Émile Henry, who killed a cafe patron and wounded several others.

France enjoyed relative political stability at home during the Belle Époque. The sudden death of President Félix Faure while in office took the country by surprise, but had no destabilising effect on the government. The most serious political issue to face the country during this period was the Dreyfus affair. Captain Alfred Dreyfus was wrongly convicted of treason, with fabricated evidence from French government officials. Antisemitism directed at Dreyfus, and tolerated by the general French public in everyday society, was a central issue in the controversy and the court trials that followed. Public debate surrounding the Dreyfus Affair grew to an uproar after the publication of &quot;J&#x27;Accuse…!&quot;, an open letter sent to newspapers by prominent novelist Émile Zola, condemning government corruption and French antisemitism. The Dreyfus affair consumed the interest of the French for several years and it received heavy newspaper coverage.

European politics saw very few regime changes, the major exception being Portugal, which experienced a republican revolution in 1910. However, tensions between working-class socialist parties, bourgeois liberal parties and landed or aristocratic conservative parties did increase in many countries, and it has been claimed that profound political instability belied the calm surface of European politics in the era. In fact, militarism and international tensions grew considerably between 1897 and 1914, and the immediate prewar years were marked by a general armaments competition in Europe. Additionally, this era was one of massive overseas colonialism, known as the New Imperialism. The most famous portion of this imperial expansion was the Scramble for Africa.

===Conflicts and wars===


Most of the great powers (and some minor ones such as Belgium, the Netherlands, or Denmark) became involved in imperialism, building their own overseas empires especially in Africa and Asia. Although there were numerous revolutions, civil wars and colonial insurrections, the most notable are: the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871), the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878), the War of the Pacific (1879–1884), two Boer Wars (1880–1881 and 1899–1902), the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the First Italo-Ethiopian War (1895–1896), the Greco-Turkish War (1897), the Spanish-American War (1898), the Philippine-American War (1899–1902), the Russo-Japanese War (1905), and the Italo-Turkish War (1911–1912).

The First Balkan War (1912–1913) and the Second Balkan War (1913) are considered prologues to the First World War (1914–1918), whose level of material and human destruction at the industrial level marks the end of the &quot;Belle Époque&quot;.

There were also notable diplomatic conflicts that could provoke world wars such as the 1890 British Ultimatum, the Fashoda Incident (1898), the First Moroccan Crisis (1905–1906), and the Second Moroccan Crisis (1911).

==Science and technology==


The Belle Époque was an era of great scientific and technological advancement in Europe and the world in general. Inventions of the Second Industrial Revolution that became generally common in this era include the perfection of lightly sprung, noiseless carriages in a multitude of new fashionable forms, which were superseded towards the end of the era by the automobile, which was for its first decade a luxurious experiment for the well-heeled. French automobile manufacturers such as Peugeot were already pioneers in carriage manufacturing. Edouard Michelin invented removable pneumatic tires for bicycles and automobiles in the 1890s. The scooter and moped are also Belle Époque inventions.

A number of French inventors patented products with a lasting impact on modern society. After the telephone joined the telegraph as a vehicle for rapid communication, French inventor Édouard Belin developed the Belinograph, or Wirephoto, to transmit photos by telephone. The electric light began to supersede gas lighting, and neon lights were invented in France.

France was a leader of early cinema technology. The cinématographe was invented in France by Léon Bouly and put to use by Auguste and Louis Lumière, brothers who held the first film screenings in the world. The Lumière brothers made many other innovations in cinematography. It was during this era that the motion pictures were developed, though these did not become common until after World War I.

Although the aeroplane remained a fascinating experiment, France was a leader in aviation. France established the world&#x27;s first national air force in 1910. Two French inventors, Louis Breguet and Paul Cornu, made independent experiments with the first flying helicopters in 1907.

Henri Becquerel discovered radioactivity in 1896 while working with phosphorescent materials. His work confirmed and explained earlier observations regarding uranium salts by Abel Niépce de Saint-Victor in 1857.

It was during this era that biologists and physicians finally came to understand the germ theory of disease, and the field of bacteriology was established. Louis Pasteur was perhaps the most famous scientist in France during this time. Pasteur developed pasteurisation and a rabies vaccine. Mathematician and physicist Henri Poincaré made important contributions to pure and applied mathematics, and also published books for the general public on mathematical and scientific subjects. Marie Skłodowska-Curie worked in France, winning the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1903, and the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1911. Physicist Gabriel Lippmann invented integral imaging, still in use today.

==Art and literature==
In 1890, Vincent van Gogh died. It was during the 1890s that his paintings achieved the admiration denied them during his life; first among other artists, then gradually among the public. Reactions against the ideals of the Impressionists characterised visual arts in Paris during the Belle Époque. Among the post-Impressionist movements in Paris were the Nabis, the Salon de la Rose + Croix, the Symbolist movement (also in poetry, music, and visual art), Fauvism, and early Modernism. Between 1900 and 1914, Expressionism took hold of many artists in Paris and Vienna. Early works of Cubism and Abstraction were exhibited. Foreign influences were being strongly felt in Paris as well. The official art school in Paris, the École des Beaux-Arts, held an exhibition of Japanese printmaking that changed approaches to graphic design, particular posters and book illustration (Aubrey Beardsley was influenced by a similar exhibit when he visited Paris during the 1890s). Exhibits of African tribal art also captured the imagination of Parisian artists at the turn of the 20th century.

Art Nouveau is the most popularly recognised art movement to emerge from the period. This largely decorative style (Jugendstil in central Europe), characterised by its curvilinear forms, and nature-inspired motifs became prominent from the mid-1890s and dominated progressive design throughout much of Europe. Its use in public art in Paris, such as Hector Guimard&#x27;s Paris Métro stations, has made it synonymous with the city.

Prominent artists in Paris during the Belle Époque included post-Impressionists such as Odilon Redon, Gustave Moreau, Maurice Denis, Pierre Bonnard, Édouard Vuillard, Paul Gauguin, Henri Matisse, Émile Bernard, Henri Rousseau, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (whose reputation improved substantially after his death), Giuseppe Amisani, and a young Pablo Picasso. More modern forms in sculpture also began to dominate as in the works of Paris-native Auguste Rodin.
Although Impressionism in painting began well before the Belle Époque, it had initially been met with scepticism if not outright scorn by a public accustomed to the realist and representational art approved by the Academy. In 1890, Monet started his series &quot;Haystacks&quot;. Impressionism, which had been considered the artistic avant-garde in the 1860s, did not gain widespread acceptance until after World War I. The academic painting style, associated with the Academy of Art in Paris, remained the most respected style among the public in Paris. Artists who appealed to the Belle Époque public include William-Adolphe Bouguereau, the English Pre-Raphaelite&#x27;s John William Waterhouse, and Lord Leighton and his depictions of idyllic Roman scenes. More progressive tastes patronised the Barbizon school &quot;plein-air&quot; painters. These painters were associates of the Pre-Raphaelites, who inspired a generation of aesthetic-minded &quot;Souls&quot;.

Many successful examples of Art Nouveau, with notable regional variations, were built in France, Germany, Belgium, Spain, Austria (the Vienna Secession), Hungary, Bohemia, Serbia, and Latvia. It soon spread around the world, including Peru, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, and the United States.

European literature underwent a major transformation during the Belle Époque. Literary realism and naturalism achieved new heights. Among the most famous French realist or naturalist authors are Guy de Maupassant and Émile Zola. Realism gradually developed into modernism, which emerged in the 1890s and came to dominate European literature during the Belle Époque&#x27;s final years and throughout the interwar years. The Modernist classic &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot; was begun by Marcel Proust in 1909, to be published after World War I. The works of German Thomas Mann had a huge impact in France as well, such as &quot;Death in Venice&quot;, published in 1912. Colette shocked France with the publication of the sexually frank &quot;Claudine&quot; novel series, and other works. Joris-Karl Huysmans, who came to prominence in the mid-1880s, continued experimenting with themes and styles that would be associated with Symbolism and the Decadent movement, mostly in his book &quot;à rebours&quot;. André Gide, Anatole France, Alain-Fournier, and Paul Bourget are among France&#x27;s most popular fiction writers of the era.

Among poets, the Symbolists such as Charles Baudelaire remained at the forefront. Although Baudelaire&#x27;s poetry collection &quot;Les Fleurs du mal&quot; had been published in the 1850s, it exerted a strong influence on the next generation of poets and artists. The Decadent movement fascinated Parisians, intrigued by Paul Verlaine and above all Arthur Rimbaud, who became the archetypal &quot;enfant terrible&quot; of France. Rimbaud&#x27;s &quot;Illuminations&quot; was published in 1886, and subsequently his other works were also published, influencing Surrealists and Modernists during the Belle Époque and after. Rimbaud&#x27;s poems were the first works of free verse seen by the French public. Free verse and typographic experimentation also emerged in &quot;Un coup de dés jamais n&#x27;abolira le hasard&quot; by Stéphane Mallarmé, anticipating Dada and concrete poetry. Guillaume Apollinaire&#x27;s poetry introduced themes and imagery from modern life to readers. &quot;Cosmopolis: An International Monthly Review&quot; had a far-reaching impact on European writers, and ran editions in London, Paris, Saint Petersburg, and Berlin.

Paris&#x27;s popular bourgeois theatre was dominated by the light farces of Georges Feydeau and cabaret performances. Theatre adopted new modern methods, including Expressionism, and many playwrights wrote plays that shocked contemporary audiences either with their frank depictions of everyday life and sexuality or with unusual artistic elements. Cabaret theatre also became popular.

Musically, the Belle Époque was characterised by salon music. This was not considered serious music but, rather, short pieces considered accessible to a general audience. In addition to works for piano solo or violin and piano, the Belle Époque was famous for its large repertory of songs (mélodies, romanze, etc.). The Italians were the greatest proponents of this type of song, its greatest champion being Francesco Paolo Tosti. Though Tosti&#x27;s songs never completely left the repertoire, salon music generally fell into a period of obscurity. Even as encores, singers were afraid to sing them at serious recitals. In that period, waltzes also flourished. Operettas were also at the peak of their popularity, with composers such as Johann Strauss III, Emmerich Kálmán, and Franz Lehár. Many Belle Époque composers working in Paris are still popular today: Igor Stravinsky, Erik Satie, Claude Debussy, Lili Boulanger, Jules Massenet, César Franck, Camille Saint-Saëns, Gabriel Fauré and his pupil, Maurice Ravel. According to Fauré and Ravel, the favoured composer of the Belle Époque was Edvard Grieg, who enjoyed the height of his popularity in both Parisian concert and salon life (despite his stance on the accused in the Dreyfus affair). Ravel and Frederick Delius agreed that French music of this time was simply &quot;Edvard Grieg plus the third act of &quot;Tristan&quot;&quot;.

Modern dance began to emerge as a powerful artistic development in theatre. Dancer Loie Fuller appeared at popular venues such as the Folies Bergère, and took her eclectic performance style abroad as well. Sergei Diaghilev&#x27;s Ballets Russes brought fame to Vaslav Nijinsky and established modern ballet technique. The Ballets Russes launched several ballet masterpieces, including &quot;The Firebird&quot; and &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; (sometimes causing audience riots at the same time).

<doc id="230325" wikidata="Q721822" url="?curid=230325" title="Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire">
<text>and are 2002 role-playing video games developed by Game Freak and published by The Pokémon Company and Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance. They are the first installments in the third generation of the &quot;Pokémon&quot; video game series, also known as the &quot;advanced generation&quot;. After years of Nintendo being the sole publisher of the franchise in all regions, The Pokémon Company co-published the games for the first time since the establishment of the joint-owned company in 1998. They were first released in Japan in late 2002, and internationally in 2003. &quot;Pokémon Emerald&quot;, a third version, was released two years later in each region. Remakes of the two games, titled &quot;Pokémon Omega Ruby&quot; and &quot;Alpha Sapphire&quot;, were released for the Nintendo 3DS worldwide in November 2014, exactly twelve years to the date of the original &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot; release date, with the exception of Europe, where it released a week later.

The gameplay is mostly unchanged from the previous games; the player controls the main character from an overhead perspective, and the controls are largely the same as those of previous games. As with previous games, the main objectives are to catch all of the Pokémon in the games and defeat the Elite Four and the Pokémon League Champion; also like their predecessors, the games&#x27; main subplot involves the player character defeating a criminal organization that attempts to take over the region. New features, such as double battles, Pokémon abilities, Pokémon Contests, and 135 new Pokémon were added. Owing to the increased capabilities of the Game Boy Advance, four players may be connected to each other at a time instead of the previous limit of two. Additionally, the games can be connected to an e-Reader or other third-generation &quot;Pokémon&quot; games.

&quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot; received mostly positive reviews. Praise was given to the new features and Pokémon designs, though critics were divided in their assessment of the games, especially on the gameplay and graphics. Most of the complaints focused on gameplay not changing much in relation to previous generations. With over 16.22 million copies sold, they were a commercial success and became the best-selling game for the Game Boy Advance; The games sold less than previous generations with &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; having sold nearly 31 million units worldwide, and &quot;Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot; selling over 23.10 million units.

==Gameplay==

The basic mechanics of &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot; are largely the same as their predecessors. As with all &quot;Pokémon&quot; games for handheld consoles, the gameplay is in third-person, overhead perspective and consists of three basic screens: a field map, in which the player navigates the main character; a battle screen; and the menu, in which the player configures their party, items, or gameplay settings. Players begin the game with one Pokémon and can capture more using Poké Balls. They can also use their Pokémon to battle other Pokémon. When the player encounters a wild Pokémon or is challenged by a trainer to a battle, the screen switches to a turn-based battle screen where the Pokémon fight. During a battle, the player may use a move, use an item, switch their active Pokémon, or flee, although fleeing is not an option in battles against trainers. All Pokémon have hit points (HP); when a Pokémon&#x27;s HP is reduced to zero, it faints and cannot battle until it is revived. If the player&#x27;s Pokémon defeats the opposing Pokémon (causes it to faint), it receives experience points. After accumulating enough experience points, it will level up; most Pokémon evolve into a new species of Pokémon when they reach a certain level.

Apart from battling, capturing Pokémon is the most essential element of &quot;Pokémon&quot; gameplay. During a battle with a wild Pokémon, the player may use a Poké Ball on them. If successful, the Pokémon will be added to the player&#x27;s active party, or stored if the player already has the maximum six Pokémon in their party. Factors in the success rate of capture include the HP, status effects such as Paralysis or Sleep, and the strength of the Poké Ball used: the lower the target&#x27;s HP and the stronger the Poké Ball, the higher the success rate of capture is. Other trainers&#x27; Pokémon cannot be captured.

===New features===

The most prominent change in the battle mechanics is the introduction of double battles, in which the opposing parties each use two Pokémon at the same time. Consequently, certain Pokémon moves can affect multiple combatants at once. Multi battles were added alongside double battles. They are identical to double battles, but there are two trainers to a side, each controlling one of the two Pokémon sent out. Also new to the games are innate abilities and natures; the former is shared by every Pokémon of a certain species, while the latter may vary among a particular species. Abilities grant their holders certain powers in battle, such as immunity against certain types of moves or strengthening a certain type of move. Natures, like innate abilities, affect the strength of Pokémon in battle; however, they affect the stats of the Pokémon rather than directly affecting the strength of the moves. Another stat introduced in &quot;Pokémon Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot; is Condition, an important factor in Pokémon Contests, mini-games in which participants perform moves before a judge. Both Pokémon and their moves have a Condition, which is increased by using Pokéblocks, which are candies made from berries. Secret bases were added as a one-off feature where players could open up a hole in the world and customize the area with various items picked up in-game. Players who linked up with others who set up secret bases were able to battle an NPC version of that trainer within their secret base.

Like &quot;Pokémon Gold&quot;, &quot;Silver&quot;, and &quot;Crystal&quot;, &quot;Pokémon Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot; keep track of real-life time; this influences events like tides and berry plant growth. However, unlike their predecessors, &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot; do not differentiate between day and night. Also, due to the differences in the technical specifications of Game Boy link cables and Game Boy Advance link cables, &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot; cannot be linked with Pokémon games of previous generations; one cannot battle with or trade with the previous generations.

===Connectivity to other devices===

&quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot; have limited e-Reader support. Nintendo released Battle-e Cards, a set of e-Reader cards that contained trainer battles in which the player could see previously hidden Pokémon. A special e-Reader card called the Eon Ticket was also released; obtained through the Mystery Gift function, the Ticket allows the player to reach a place called Southern Island. There, the player faces either Latios or Latias, depending on which version of the game is used.

&quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot; are also able to connect to the GameCube games &quot;Pokémon Colosseum&quot;, &quot;Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness&quot; and &quot;Pokémon Box: Ruby and Sapphire&quot;. In the former two, once players reach a certain point in the game, they are able to transfer Pokémon between &quot;Colosseum&quot; / &quot;XD&quot; and &quot;Ruby&quot; / &quot;Sapphire&quot;. Additionally, those who pre-ordered &quot;Colosseum&quot; were able to access the Pokémon Jirachi and see a preview of the movie &quot;Pokémon: Jirachi Wish Maker&quot;. &quot;Pokémon Box&quot; allows players to store and organize their Pokémon on the GameCube. Also, in the European version of &quot;Pokémon Channel&quot;, players could receive a Jirachi at a certain point in the game, which they could then transfer over to &quot;Ruby&quot; or &quot;Sapphire&quot;.

&quot;Pokémon Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot; occur in the Hoenn region, some distance from the Kanto and Johto regions featured in previous games. The design of Hoenn was based on the Japanese island and region of Kyushu; however, Hoenn is rotated 90° relative to Kyushu, as Junichi Masuda felt that it would provide a better gameplay balance. Like Kyushu, Hoenn possesses many smaller islands, and part of the region is dominated by sea routes, several of which contain areas where the player can dive underwater.

===Story===

Like other &quot;Pokémon&quot; games, &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;″s gameplay is linear; the main events occur in a fixed order. The protagonist of &quot;Pokémon Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot; are Brendan and May, who have recently moved to a small town called Littleroot Town. At the beginning of the games, the player chooses either Treecko, Torchic, or Mudkip to protect Professor Birch, the regional professor, from attacking Poochyena. After defending Birch, the player is taken to his lab and receives the chosen Pokémon as their starter Pokémon. After that, the player encounters May/Brendan, the child of Professor Birch. The player&#x27;s rival, who appears as the professor&#x27;s child, is also a Pokémon Trainer and occasionally battles the player. The games&#x27; two main goals are defeating the eight Gym Leaders, proving oneself worthy of challenging the Elite Four and Hoenn League Champion to become the new Hoenn League Champion and completing the Pokédex by capturing, evolving, and trading to obtain all 202 Pokémon available between &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;. It is possible to obtain all 386 Pokémon, but this requires trading with &quot;Pokémon FireRed&quot; and &quot;LeafGreen&quot; or &quot;Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness&quot; and &quot;Pokémon Colosseum&quot;.

In addition to the main quest of defeating the Gym Leaders, there are side quests in which the player can aid NPCs by fulfilling tasks, usually by obtaining items. The most prominent subplot involves Team Aqua and Team Magma, crime syndicates who want to use Pokémon to alter the climate of Hoenn: in &quot;Ruby&quot;, the villains, Team Magma, want to use the legendary Pokémon Groudon to dry up the oceans of Hoenn and increase the region&#x27;s landmass; in &quot;Sapphire&quot;, Team Aqua are the villains and they try to use Groudon&#x27;s counterpart, Kyogre, to flood the landmasses of Hoenn and increase the region&#x27;s ocean. Prior to facing the eighth Gym Leader, the player has a showdown with Magma or Aqua where the team&#x27;s leader uses a mystical orb that awakens the slumbering Pokémon, believing it has the power to enthrall their respective target, only for the Pokémon to become enraged and cause catastrophic, region-wide climate changes—a drought in &quot;Ruby&quot;, and heavy rainfall in &quot;Sapphire&quot;—until it is defeated or captured by the protagonist. The player&#x27;s father also introduces them to Wally, a sickly young boy whom the player helps capture a Pokémon to be his companion as he moves away from the big city. Wally eventually overcomes his illness and becomes a successful Pokémon Trainer, ultimately becoming the final challenger the player must face before the Elite Four.

==Development==

&quot;Pokémon Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot; were developed by Game Freak and Nintendo under the direction of Junichi Masuda. As with its predecessors, Ken Sugimori was the art director, although these were the first games in which he did not single-handedly produce all of the art. When asked where his design team came up with the ideas for all of the new Pokémon, Sugimori stated that they got their ideas from past experiences in their childhood involving nature, animals, and the media and then base them on insects. Even looking at the world in a different perspective sometimes provided inspiration for the creatures. &quot;First we select an insect and after that we add essential elements to the insects to make it more like Pokemon, such as adding some hard shape to it, to be more like steel,&quot; Sugimori said, describing the process of creating a Pokémon.

As the Game Boy Advance was able to handle enhanced graphics, &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot; were the first games in the series that allowed up to four people to share information at one time, as opposed to the previous limit of two. However, the development team used a more basic graphics engine to keep the game simple and not overly confusing. The team wanted the games to appeal to a large audience, so the game was designed to be easy enough for younger generations of children to play, but new features were added to bring the veteran gamers back.

Masuda stated that the basic philosophy of all &quot;Pokémon&quot; games is communication; in the &quot;Pokémon&quot; series, this is manifested in trading and battling with other people. When asked about the new concept of double battles, the developers noted that they tried to focus more on the original one-on-one battles as the main type of competition and only added the double battles as a &quot;new challenge&quot;. They stated that if they receive positive feedback about the double battles, the feature may appear more in future generations.

The games were the first in the series that did not contain all of the Pokémon from previous generations. Sugimori stated that the team tried to include all the new Pokémon as well as some from previous generations. When asked about any features that could not be included due to technical restrictions, Masuda noted that he wanted each individual Pokémon to make up to three different cries depending on its mood.

===Audio===
The audio of &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot; consists entirely of game music and sound effects; all dialogue is on-screen. The music, composed by Junichi Masuda, Go Ichinose and Morikazu Aoki, is completely instrumental except for two tracks with vocals, &quot;Trick Master&quot; and &quot;Slateport City&quot;. The soundtrack of the game was released under the Mediafactory label in Japan on April 26, 2003; the album reached #297 on the Oricon charts and charted for one week. Junichi Masuda wrote only battle tunes, Go Ichinose wrote most of the town, route, fanfare &amp; &#x27;Spotted&#x27; tunes, whereas Morikazu Aoki did the remainder.

The soundtrack is noted for its heavy use of trumpets, but it also makes heavy use of French horns, strings ensembles, and even pianos.



==Release==
&quot;Pokémon Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot; were released in Japan on November 21, 2002, in North America on March 19, 2003, in Australia on April 3, 2003, and in Europe on July 25, 2003. Nintendo did not promote &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot; at E3 2002; however, it launched a $7 million promotional campaign that lasted from March to May 2003. In July and August 2002 they were promoted through a tour across Japan at Pokémon Festa 2002. In addition to rewarding pre-orders of the games with merchandise, Nintendo held a contest in which participants submitted videos of themselves singing the &quot;Pokémon&quot; theme song with their own re-written lyrics; the grand prize for that event was a Lugia PT Cruiser. Later that year, Nintendo launched the EON Ticket Summer Tour, in which 125 Toys &quot;R&quot; Us stores across the United States offered the Eon Ticket e-Card in stores from July 19 to September 1. Nintendo aired two television advertisements, &quot;Faces&quot; and &quot;Names&quot;, on prime-time network, cable, and syndication. &quot;Faces&quot; featured Pokémon juxtaposed with human look-alikes; &quot;Names&quot; featured people shouting out the names of Pokémon and emphasized the fact that the games introduced 100 new Pokémon. Additionally, Nintendo collaborated with United Kingdom beverage brand Vimto to promote the games.

===&quot;Pokémon Emerald&quot;===

 is a third version after &quot;Pokémon Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;, developed by Game Freak, published by The Pokémon Company and Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance. It was first released in Japan in 2004, and was later released internationally in 2005. &quot;Emerald&quot; received generally positive reception and by fiscal year 2007 sales had reached 6.32 million units.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
The games met with mostly positive reviews. &quot;IGN&quot; gave them an &quot;Amazing&quot; 9.5 out of 10 rating and awarded them the Editor&#x27;s Choice Award; in 2007, the games were collectively named the tenth best Game Boy Advance game of all time in an &quot;IGN&quot; article. &quot;GameZone&quot; also gave the games a 9.5 out of 10 rating and awarded them an Outstanding Award. &quot;GamePro&quot; gave the games 5 out of 5 stars and named them Editor&#x27;s Choices. &quot;ComputerAndVideoGames.com&quot; gave the games a 9 out of 10, and &quot;GameSpot&quot; gave the games 8.1 out of 10, naming it the best Game Boy Advance game of March 2003. &quot;Eurogamer&quot; and &quot;1UP.com&quot; were less enthusiastic about the games, however; &quot;Eurogamer&quot; gave the games 7 out of 10, and &quot;1UP.com&quot; gave them a B−.

Reviewers were divided in their critiques of the games, especially concerning the gameplay and graphics. &quot;IGN&quot; praised the &quot;deep design&quot; and noted that the addition of features such as double battles greatly increased the strategic aspect of the games. &quot;GamePro&quot; also thought that the addition of double battles &quot;add[ed] challenge&quot; and &quot;made the harder battles far more strategic than before—the way the game should be&quot;. Likewise, &quot;ComputerAndVideoGames.com&quot; called the gameplay &quot;incredibly compelling and addictive&quot;. &quot;GameZone&quot; noted that the gameplay was more refined and challenging than that of previous titles. However, &quot;GameSpot&quot; called the games &quot;a cakewalk from start to finish&quot; and claimed that &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot; &quot;don&#x27;t offer much of a challenge&quot;. &quot;Eurogamer&quot; also felt that the mechanics &quot;[get] very tired, very fast&quot;. &quot;1UP.com&quot; also felt that the games were formulaic and that double battles were underused.

&quot;ComputerAndVideoGames.com&quot; was enthusiastic over the graphics, calling them &quot;gorgeous&quot;. Other reviewers were less enthusiastic, however. &quot;GamePro&quot; felt that the graphics were only &quot;a fair bit prettier&quot; than those of the Game Boy Color games; &quot;GameZone&quot; said that the games &quot;still [use] the simple animations and basic character designs that were created for the original, color-less Game Boy&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; and &quot;1UP.com&quot; noted that the graphics had received only a minor upgrade, and &quot;Eurogamer&quot; felt that the graphics had been upgraded to a &quot;functional level at best&quot;. The audio was generally well-received: &quot;GameZone&quot; and &quot;GameSpot&quot; both felt the audio was catchy; &quot;GameZone&quot; gave the audio an 8 out of 10 score, saying that while the music &quot;was annoying at times, [...] it&#x27;s also very good. [...] I found myself humming the music when I wasn&#x27;t playing&quot;. Other complaints included the removal of the time system of &quot;Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot; and the inability to import Pokémon from the games of previous generations.

===Sales===
&quot;Pokémon Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot; were highly anticipated. In Japan, they sold 1.25 million units within the first four days of release and were the best-selling games of the 2002 holiday season; sales totaled around 4.4 million within six weeks of release. They also became the first games to sell 2 million copies in Japan since 2001&#x27;s &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; and the first games for a handheld console to do so since 2000&#x27;s &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters 4&quot;.

In North America, Nintendo sold 2.2 million units by April 2003, less than one month after the games&#x27; release in that region. In the United States, &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot; were the second- and third-best-selling games of 2003, respectively. The games enjoyed success in Europe as well. Even before release, European retailers imported cartridges from the United States to meet the high demand. Upon release, 500,000 copies were sold in its first weekend and sold within eight weeks. They were the second-best-selling games of the holiday season in 2002. The games were brought up at E3 2003 by Satoru Iwata as a symbol of how successful the Game Boy Advance was at the time.

With 16.22 million units sold worldwide as of 2023, they are the best-selling games for the Game Boy Advance. However, analysts noted that with &quot;young kids...gravitating toward &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot;&quot; at the time, &quot;Pokémon&quot;″s popularity was waning even before the American release of &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;. This was reflected in the games&#x27; sales compared to those of previous generations: &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; sold nearly 31 million units worldwide, and &quot;Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot; sold over 23 million units.

===Remakes===

 and are enhanced remakes of &quot;Pokémon Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;. The new titles were developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 3DS. They were released worldwide for the Nintendo 3DS on November 21, 2014, exactly twelve years after the original release date of &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;, while the European release was the following week.

====&quot;Pokémon Box: Ruby and Sapphire&quot;====

 or simply , is a spin-off &quot;Pokémon&quot; game for the GameCube, bundled with a GameCube – Game Boy Advance link cable and a Memory Card 59. It was released in Japan on May 30, 2003, and in North America on July 12, 2004, but only through the New York Pokémon Center and its online store, and it is no longer available in either location. The game was released in some parts of Europe as Pokémon Memory Magic due to translation problems and Europeans could only get the game by using points from Nintendo of Europe&#x27;s loyalty program or by buying the &quot;Pokémon Colosseum Mega Pack&quot;.

The game is essentially a storage system for the Game Boy Advance &quot;Pokémon&quot; games that allow players to trade and store Pokémon that they have caught in &quot;Ruby&quot;, &quot;Sapphire&quot;, &quot;Emerald&quot;, &quot;FireRed&quot; and &quot;LeafGreen&quot; onto a GameCube memory card. Players can then organize and interact with their Pokémon on the GameCube, such as allowing them to breed. Unique Pokémon can also be acquired. Another feature allows &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot; to be played on the television via the GameCube – Game Boy Advance link cable. Options such as taking screenshots of the game are available in this mode. Another addition is the &quot;Showcase&quot;, where players can create and display game pieces of Pokémon.

Nintendo referred to the game as &quot;the most exclusive Pokémon software ever offered to North American &quot;Pokémon&quot; fans,&quot; but it was generally considered to be unnecessary, receiving a score of 50% on GameRankings from 1 review. Craig Harris of &quot;IGN&quot; gave the game a &quot;&quot; rating of 5.0 out of 10, praising the interface, which makes the organization of Pokémon much easier as compared to the Game Boy Advance interface, as well as the emulator which allows &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot; to be played on the GameCube. He also stated that the game was a good deal due to the inclusion of a memory card and link cable. However, Harris cited the &quot;Showcase&quot; as &quot;entirely unnecessary and completely out of place&quot;, and said that overall the game lacked much to do. He wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s targeted specifically for the truly die-hard &quot;Pokemon&quot; fan, but it requires so many specific elements to actually be useful to anyone.&quot; &quot;Allgame&quot; gave the game three and a half out of five stars.

<text>Lungfish are freshwater vertebrates belonging to the class Dipnoi. Lungfish are best known for retaining ancestral characteristics within the Osteichthyes, including the ability to breathe air, and ancestral structures within Sarcopterygii, including the presence of lobed fins with a well-developed internal skeleton. Lungfish represent the closest living relatives of the tetrapods (which includes living amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals). The mouths of lungfish typically bear tooth plates, which are used to crush hard shelled organisms.

Today there are only six known species of lungfish, living in Africa, South America, and Australia, though they were formerly globally distributed. The fossil record of the group extends into the Early Devonian, over 410 million years ago. The earliest known members of the group were marine, while almost all post-Carboniferous representatives inhabit freshwater environments.

==Etymology==
Modern Latin from the Greek δίπνοος (dipnoos) with two breathing structures, from δι- twice and πνοή breathing, breath.

==Anatomy and morphology==
All lungfish demonstrate an uninterrupted cartilaginous notochord and an extensively developed palatal dentition. Basal (&quot;primitive&quot;) lungfish groups may retain marginal teeth and an ossified braincase, but derived lungfish groups, including all modern species, show a significant reduction in the marginal bones and a cartilaginous braincase. The bones of the skull roof in primitive lungfish are covered in a mineralized tissue called cosmine, but in post-Devonian lungfishes, the skull roof lies beneath the skin and the cosmine covering is lost. All modern lungfish show significant reductions and fusions of the bones of the skull roof, and the specific bones of the skull roof show no homology to the skull roof bones of ray-finned fishes or tetrapods. During the breeding season, the South American lungfish develops a pair of feathery appendages that are actually highly modified pelvic fins. These fins are thought to improve gas exchange around the fish&#x27;s eggs in its nest.

Through convergent evolution, lungfishes have evolved internal nostrils similar to the tetrapods&#x27; choana, and a brain with certain similarities to Lissamphibian brain (except for the Queensland lungfish, which branched off in its own direction about 277 million years ago and has a brain resembling that of the &quot;Latimeria&quot;).

The dentition of lungfish is different from that of any other vertebrate group. &quot;Odontodes&quot; on the palate and lower jaws develop in a series of rows to form a fan-shaped occlusion surface. These odontodes then wear to form a uniform crushing surface. In several groups, including the modern lepidosireniformes, these ridges have been modified to form occluding blades.

The modern lungfishes have a number of larval features, which suggest paedomorphosis. They also demonstrate the largest genome among the vertebrates.

Modern lungfish all have an elongate body with fleshy, paired pectoral and pelvic fins and a single unpaired caudal fin replacing the dorsal, caudal and anal fins of most fishes.

==Lungs==
Lungfish have a highly specialized respiratory system. They have a distinct feature in that their lungs are connected to the larynx and pharynx without a trachea. While other species of fish can breathe air using modified, vascularized gas bladders, these bladders are usually simple sacs, devoid of complex internal structure. In contrast, the lungs of lungfish are subdivided into numerous smaller air sacs, maximizing the surface area available for gas exchange.

Most extant lungfish species have two lungs, with the exception of the Australian lungfish, which has only one. The lungs of lungfish are homologous to the lungs of tetrapods. As in tetrapods and bichirs, the lungs extend from the ventral surface of the esophagus and gut.

===Perfusion of water===
Of extant lungfish, only the Australian lungfish can breathe through its gills without needing air from its lung. In other species, the gills are too atrophied to allow for adequate gas exchange. When a lungfish is obtaining oxygen from its gills, its circulatory system is configured similarly to the common fish. The spiral valve of the conus arteriosus is open, the bypass arterioles of the third and fourth gill arches (which do not actually have gills) are shut, the second, fifth and sixth gill arch arterioles are open, the ductus arteriosus branching off the sixth arteriole is open, and the pulmonary arteries are closed. As the water passes through the gills, the lungfish uses a buccal pump. Flow through the mouth and gills is unidirectional. Blood flow through the secondary lamellae is countercurrent to the water, maintaining a more constant concentration gradient.

===Perfusion of air===
When breathing air, the spiral valve of the conus arteriosus closes (minimizing the mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood), the third and fourth gill arches open, the second and fifth gill arches close (minimizing the possible loss of the oxygen obtained in the lungs through the gills), the sixth arteriole&#x27;s ductus arteriosus is closed, and the pulmonary arteries open. Importantly, during air breathing, the sixth gill is still used in respiration; deoxygenated blood loses some of its carbon dioxide as it passes through the gill before reaching the lung. This is because carbon dioxide is more soluble in water. Air flow through the mouth is tidal, and through the lungs it is bidirectional and observes &quot;uniform pool&quot; diffusion of oxygen.

==Ecology and life history==
Lungfish are omnivorous, feeding on fish, insects, crustaceans, worms, mollusks, amphibians and plant matter. They have an intestinal spiral valve rather than a true stomach.

African and South American lungfish are capable of surviving seasonal drying out of their habitats by burrowing into mud and estivating throughout the dry season. Changes in physiology allow it to slow its metabolism to as little as one sixtieth of the normal metabolic rate, and protein waste is converted from ammonia to less-toxic urea (normally, lungfish excrete nitrogenous waste as ammonia directly into the water).

Burrowing is seen in at least one group of fossil lungfish, the Gnathorhizidae.

Lungfish can be extremely long-lived. A Queensland lungfish called &quot;Granddad&quot; at the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago was part of the permanent live collection from 1933 to 2017 after a previous residence at the Sydney Aquarium; at 109 years old, it was euthanized following a decline in health consistent with old age.

As of 2022, the oldest lungfish, and probably the oldest aquarium fish in the world is &quot;Methuselah&quot;, an Australian lungfish long and weighing around . Methuselah is believed to be female, unlike its namesake, and is estimated to be over 90 years old.

==Evolution==
About 420 million years ago, during the Devonian, the last common ancestor of both lungfish and the tetrapods split into two separate evolutionary lineages, with the ancestor of the extant coelacanths diverging a little earlier from a sarcopterygian progenitor. &quot;Youngolepis&quot; and &quot;Diabolepis&quot;, dating to 419–417 million years ago, during Early Devonian (Lochkovian), are the currently oldest known lungfish, and show that the lungfishes had adapted to a diet including hard-shelled prey (durophagy) very early in their evolution. The earliest lungfish were marine. Almost all post-Carboniferous lungfish inhabit or inhabited freshwater environments. There were likely at least two transitions amongst lungfish from marine to freshwater habitats. The last common ancestor of all living lungfish likely lived sometime between the Late Carboniferous and the Jurassic. Lungfish remained present in the northern Laurasian landmasses into the Cretaceous period.

==Extant lungfish==

The Queensland lungfish, &quot;Neoceratodus forsteri&quot;, is endemic to Australia. Fossil records of this group date back 380 million years, around the time when the higher vertebrate classes were beginning to evolve. Fossils of lungfish belonging to the genus &quot;Neoceratodus&quot; have been uncovered in northern New South Wales, indicating that the Queensland lungfish has existed in Australia for at least 100 million years, making it a living fossil and one of the oldest living vertebrate genera on the planet. It is the most primitive surviving member of the ancient air-breathing lungfish (Dipnoi) lineages. The five other freshwater lungfish species, four in Africa and one in South America, are very different morphologically to &quot;N. forsteri&quot;. The Queensland lungfish can live for several days out of the water if it is kept moist, but will not survive total water depletion, unlike its African counterparts.
The South American lungfish, &quot;Lepidosiren paradoxa&quot;, is the single species of lungfish found in swamps and slow-moving waters of the Amazon, Paraguay, and lower Paraná River basins in South America. Notable as an obligate air-breather, it is the sole member of its family native to the Americas. Relatively little is known about the South American lungfish, or &quot;scaly salamander-fish&quot;. When immature it is spotted with gold on a black background. In the adult this fades to a brown or gray color. Its tooth-bearing premaxillary and maxillary bones are fused like other lungfish. South American lungfishes also share an autostylic jaw suspension (where the palatoquadrate is fused to the cranium) and powerful adductor jaw muscles with the extant lungfish (Dipnoi). Like the African lungfishes, this species has an elongate, almost eel-like body. It may reach a length of . The pectoral fins are thin and threadlike, while the pelvic fins are somewhat larger, and set far back. The fins are connected to the shoulder by a single bone, which is a marked difference from most fish, whose fins usually have at least four bones at their base; and a marked similarity with nearly all land-dwelling vertebrates. They have the lowest aquatic respiration of all extant lungfish species, and their gills are greatly reduced and essentially non-functional in the adults.
The marbled lungfish, &quot;Protopterus aethiopicus&quot;, is found in Africa. The marbled lungfish is smooth, elongated, and cylindrical with deeply embedded scales. The tail is very long and tapers at the end. They are the largest of the African lungfish species as they can reach a length of up to 200 cm. The pectoral and pelvic fins are also very long and thin, almost spaghetti-like. The newly hatched young have branched external gills much like those of newts. After 2 to 3 months the young transform (called metamorphosis) into the adult form, losing the external gills for gill openings. These fish have a yellowish gray or pinkish toned ground color with dark slate-gray splotches, creating a marbling or leopard effect over the body and fins. The color pattern is darker along the top and lighter below. The marbled lungfish&#x27;s genome contains 133 billion base pairs, making it the largest known genome of any vertebrate. The only organisms known to have more base pairs are the protist &quot;Polychaos dubium&quot; and the flowering plant &quot;Paris japonica&quot; at 670 billion and 150 billion, respectively.
The gilled lungfish, &quot;Protopterus amphibius&quot; is a species of lungfish found in East Africa. It generally reaches only long, making it the smallest extant lungfish in the world. This lungfish is uniform blue, or slate grey in colour. It has small or inconspicuous black spots, and a pale grey belly.
The west African lungfish, &quot;Protopterus annectens&quot;, is a species of lungfish found in West Africa. It has a prominent snout and small eyes. Its body is long and eel-like, some 9–15 times the length of the head. It has two pairs of long, filamentous fins. The pectoral fins have a basal fringe and are about three times the head length, while its pelvic fins are about twice the head length. In general, three external gills are inserted posterior to the gill slits and above the pectoral fins. It has cycloid scales embedded in the skin. There are 40–50 scales between the operculum and the anus and 36–40 around the body before the origin of the dorsal fin. It has 34–37 pairs of ribs. The dorsal side is olive or brown in color and the ventral side is lighter, with great blackish or brownish spots on the body and fins except on its belly. They reach a length of about 100 cm in the wild.
The spotted lungfish, &quot;Protopterus dolloi&quot;, is a species of lungfish found in Africa. Specifically, it is found in the Kouilou-Niari Basin of the Republic of the Congo and Ogowe River basin in Gabon. It is also found in the lower and Middle Congo River Basins. &quot;Protopterus dolloi&quot; can aestivate on land by surrounding itself in a layer of dried mucus. It can reach a length of up to 130 cm.
==Taxonomy==

The relationship of lungfishes to the rest of the bony fish is well understood:
* Lungfishes are most closely related to &quot;Powichthys&quot;, and then to the Porolepiformes.
* Together, these taxa form the Dipnomorpha, the sister group to the Tetrapodomorpha.
* Together, these form the Rhipidistia, the sister group to the coelacanths.

Recent molecular genetic analyses strongly support a sister relationship of lungfishes and tetrapods (Rhipidistia), with coelacanths branching slightly earlier.

The relationships among lungfishes are significantly more difficult to resolve. While Devonian lungfish had enough bone in the skull to determine relationships, post-Devonian lungfish are represented entirely by skull roofs and teeth, as the rest of the skull is cartilaginous. Additionally, many of the taxa already identified may not be monophyletic.

<text>The Oval Office is the formal working space of the president of the United States. Part of the Executive Office of the President of the United States, it is in the West Wing of the White House, in Washington, D.C.

The oval room has three large windows facing the South Lawn, in front of which the president&#x27;s desk traditionally stands, and a fireplace at the north end. Two built-in bookcases are recessed in the western wall. There are four doors: the east door opens to the Rose Garden; the west door leads to a private study and dining room; the northwest door opens onto the main corridor of the West Wing; and the northeast door opens to the office of the president&#x27;s secretary.

The room takes inspiration from the bow oval rooms in the main residence of the White House. The west wing oval office was created when the wing was expanded in the early 1900s, a few years after the wing was built. Presidents generally decorate the office to suit their own personal tastes, choosing furniture and drapery and often commissioning oval carpets. Artwork is selected from the White House collection, or borrowed from museums for the president&#x27;s term.

==Cultural history==
The Oval Office has become associated in Americans&#x27; minds with the presidency itself through memorable images, such as a young John F. Kennedy, Jr. peering through the front panel of his father&#x27;s desk, President Richard Nixon speaking by telephone with the Apollo 11 astronauts during their moonwalk, and Amy Carter bringing her Siamese cat Misty Malarky Ying Yang to brighten her father President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s day. Several presidents have addressed the nation from the Oval Office on occasion. Examples include Kennedy presenting news of the Cuban Missile Crisis (1962), Nixon announcing his resignation from office (1974), Ronald Reagan following the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster (1986), and George W. Bush in the wake of the September 11 attacks (2001). 

==History, 1789–1909 ==
===Washington&#x27;s bow window===
The White House was not ready for occupancy until 1800. George Washington never occupied the White House. He spent most of his presidency in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which served as the temporary national capital for 10 years, from 1790 to 1800, while Washington, D.C., a new city, was under construction.

In 1790, Washington built a large, two-story, semi-circular addition to the rear of the President&#x27;s House in Philadelphia, creating a ceremonial space in which the public would meet the president. Standing before the three windows of this bow window, he formally received guests for his Tuesday afternoon audiences, delegations from Congress and foreign dignitaries, and the general public at open houses on New Year&#x27;s Day, the Fourth of July, and his birthday.

Washington received his guests, standing between the windows in his back drawing-room. The company, entering a front room and passing through an unfolding door, made their salutations to the President, and turning off, stood on one side.

President John Adams occupied the Philadelphia mansion from March 1797, and used the bow window in the same manner as had his predecessor.

Curved foundations of Washington&#x27;s bow window were uncovered during archaeological excavation of the site of the President&#x27;s House in 2007. They are exhibited under glass at the President&#x27;s House Commemoration, next to the Liberty Bell Center.

===White House===
Architect James Hoban visited President Washington in Philadelphia in June 1792, and probably saw the bow window. The next month, Hoban won the design competition for the White House.

The elliptic salon at the center of the White House was the outstanding feature of Hoban&#x27;s original plan. Oval rooms became common in neoclassical architecture early in the 19th century.

In November 1800, John Adams became the first president to occupy the White House. He and his successor, President Thomas Jefferson, used Hoban&#x27;s oval rooms as Washington had used his bow window salon, standing before the three windows at the south end to receive guests.

In the 19th century, some presidents used the White House&#x27;s second-floor Yellow Oval Room as their private offices and libraries. This cultural association, between the president and an oval room, was more fully expressed in the Taft Oval Office (1909) in the West Wing.
===West Wing===

The West Wing was the idea of President Theodore Roosevelt, brought about by his wife&#x27;s opinion that the second floor of the White House, then shared between bedrooms and offices, should be solely a domestic space. Completed in 1902, the one-story Executive Office Building was intended to be a temporary structure, for use until a permanent building was erected there or elsewhere. Sitting the building west of the White House allowed the removal of a vast, dilapidated set of pre–Civil War greenhouses, which had been erected by President James Buchanan.

Roosevelt moved the offices of the executive branch into the newly constructed wing in 1902. His workspace was a two-room suite of Executive Office and Cabinet Room, occupying the eastern third of the building. Its furniture, including the president&#x27;s desk, was designed by architect Charles Follen McKim, and executed by A. H. Davenport and Company, both of Boston. Now much altered, the 1902 Executive Office survives as the Roosevelt Room, a windowless interior meeting room situated diagonally from the Oval Office.

==Taft Oval Office: 1909–1933==

President William Howard Taft made the West Wing a permanent building, doubling its size by expanding it southward, and building the first Oval Office. Designed by Nathan C. Wyeth and completed in 1909, the office was centered on the building&#x27;s south facade, much as the oval rooms in the White House are. Taft wanted to be more involved with the day-to-day operation of his presidency, and intended the office to be the hub of his administration. The Taft Oval Office had ample natural light from its three windows and skylight. It featured a white marble mantel, simple Georgian Revival woodwork, and twin glass-doored bookcases. It also was likely the most colorful presidential office in history; its walls were covered with vibrant seagrass green burlap.

On December 24, 1929, during the first year of President Herbert Hoover&#x27;s administration, a fire severely damaged the West Wing. Hoover used this as an opportunity to create additional space, excavating a partial basement for staff offices. He restored the Oval Office, upgrading the quality of trim and installing air conditioning. He also replaced the furniture, which had undergone no major changes in twenty years.
==Modern Oval Office: 1934–present==
Dissatisfied with the size and layout of the West Wing, President Franklin D. Roosevelt engaged New York architect Eric Gugler to redesign it in 1933. To create additional staff space without increasing the apparent size of the building, Gugler excavated a full basement, added a set of subterranean offices under the adjacent lawn, and built an unobtrusive penthouse storey. The directive to wring the most office space out of the existing building was responsible for its narrow corridors and cramped staff offices. Gugler&#x27;s most visible addition was the expansion of the building eastward for a new Cabinet Room and Oval Office.

The modern Oval Office was built at the West Wing&#x27;s southeast corner, offering Roosevelt, who was physically disabled and used a wheelchair, more privacy and easier access to the Residence. He and Gugler devised a room architecturally grander than the previous two offices, with more robust Georgian details: doors topped with substantial pediments, bookcases set into niches, a deep bracketed cornice, and a ceiling medallion of the Presidential Seal. Rather than a chandelier or ceiling fixture, the room is illuminated by light bulbs hidden within the cornice that wash the ceiling in light. In small ways, hints of Art Moderne can be seen, in the sconces flanking the windows and the representation of the eagle in the ceiling medallion. Roosevelt and Gugler worked closely together, often over breakfast, with Gugler sketching the president&#x27;s ideas. One notion resulting from these sketches that has become fixed in the layout of the room&#x27;s furniture is that of two high back chairs in front of the fireplace. The public sees this most often with the president seated on the left and a visiting guest on the right. This allowed Roosevelt to be seated, with his guests at the same level, de-emphasizing his inability to stand without help. Construction of the modern Oval Office was completed in 1934.

===Decoration===

The basic Oval Office furnishings have been a desk in front of the three windows at the south end, a pair of chairs in front of the fireplace at the north end, a pair of sofas, and assorted tables and chairs. The Neoclassical mantel was made for the Taft Oval Office in 1909 and salvaged after the 1929 West Wing fire. A tradition of displaying potted Swedish ivy (&quot;Plectranthus verticillatus&quot;) atop the mantel goes back to the administration of John F. Kennedy, and the current plants were rooted from the original plant.

A Federal longcase clock, made in Boston by John and Thomas Seymour c. 1795–1805 – commonly known as the Oval Office grandfather clock – was purchased by the White House Historical Association in 1972, and has stood next to the Oval Office&#x27;s northeast door since 1975.

President Harry S. Truman replaced the Oval Office&#x27;s 23-year-old dark green carpet in 1947. He had revised the seal of the president of the United States after World War II, and his blue-gray carpet incorporated the , represented monochromatically through varying depths of its cut pile. The Truman carpet remained in the office through the Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy administrations. Jacqueline Kennedy&#x27;s redecoration of the Oval Office began on November 21, 1963, while she and President Kennedy were away on a trip to Texas. The following day, November 22, a red carpet was installed, just as the Kennedys were making their way through Dallas, where the president was assassinated. Johnson had the red carpet removed and the Truman carpet reinstalled, and used the latter for his administration. Since Johnson, most administrations have created their own oval carpet, working with an interior designer and the curator of the White House.

====Desks====


Six desks have been used in the Oval Office by U.S. presidents since its construction in 1909. The desk usually sits in front of the south wall of the Oval Office, which is composed of three large windows. Some presidents only use the desk in this room for ceremonial purposes, such as photo opportunities and press announcements, while others use it as their main workspace.

The first desk used in the Oval Office was the Theodore Roosevelt desk, and the desk currently in use by Donald Trump is the &quot;Resolute&quot; desk. Of the six desks used in the Oval Office, the &quot;Resolute&quot; desk has spent the longest time there, having been used by eight presidents in the room. The &quot;Resolute&quot; has been used by all U.S. presidents since 1977 with the exception of George H. W. Bush, who used the C&amp;O desk for his one term, making it the shortest-serving desk to date. Other past presidents have used the Hoover desk, the Johnson desk, and the Wilson desk.

The &quot;Resolute&quot; desk, the current desk in use, is built from oak timbers that were once part of the ship . The British &quot;Resolute&quot; was trapped in Arctic ice in 1854 and abandoned. The ship was discovered in 1855 by an American whaling ship and later underwent a complete refit, repaint, and restock paid for by the United States Government. It was returned to England in 1856 and decommissioned in 1879. The same year the British Admiralty launched a competition to design a piece of furniture made from the timbers of the &quot;Resolute&quot; which Queen Victoria could gift to the American president. Following a design competition, Queen Victoria ordered that three desks be made from the timbers of &quot;Resolute&quot;. The one that is now known as the &quot;Resolute&quot; desk was designed by Morant, Boyd, &amp; Blanford, built by William Evenden at Chatham Dockyard, and announced as &quot;recently manufactured&quot; on November 18, 1880. The desk was delivered as a gift to President Rutherford B. Hayes in 1880. President Franklin D. Roosevelt requested that a panel be installed in the kneehole during his presidency. The desk was used in various areas of the White House until Jacqueline Kennedy had it moved to the Oval Office in 1961. Following the 1963 assassination of President Kennedy, the &quot;Resolute&quot; desk was transferred, on loan, to the Smithsonian Institution and went on tour around the country to help raise funds for the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum. After this tour, the desk was put on view at the Smithsonian Institution beginning in 1966. Jimmy Carter returned the &quot;Resolute&quot; desk to the Oval Office in 1977.

=== Artwork ===
Artworks are selected from the White House collection or may be borrowed from museums or individuals for the length of an administration.

Most presidents have hung a portrait of George Washington – usually the Rembrandt Peale Porthole portrait or the Charles Willson Peale three-quarter-length portrait – over the mantel at the north end of the room. A portrait of Andrew Jackson by Thomas Sully hung in the offices of Lyndon B. Johnson, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton. A portrait of Abraham Lincoln by George Henry Story hung in George W. Bush&#x27;s office and continued in Barack Obama&#x27;s and Joe Biden&#x27;s. Three landscapes and cityscapes – &quot;City of Washington from Beyond the Navy Yard&quot; by George Cooke, &quot;Eastport and Passamaquoddy Bay&quot; by Victor de Grailly, and &quot;The President&#x27;s House&quot;, a copy after William Henry Bartlett – have adorned the walls in multiple administrations. &quot;Passing the Outpost&quot; (1881) by Alfred Wordsworth Thompson, a Revolutionary War genre scene of a carriage stopped at a British checkpoint, hung in Gerald Ford&#x27;s office, and in Jimmy Carter&#x27;s and Ronald Reagan&#x27;s. &quot;The Avenue in the Rain&quot; by Childe Hassam and &quot;Working on the Statue of Liberty&quot; by Norman Rockwell flanked the &quot;Resolute&quot; desk in Bill Clinton&#x27;s office and did the same in Barack Obama&#x27;s. &quot;Avenue in the Rain&quot; hung beside the &quot;Resolute&quot; desk in Joe Biden&#x27;s office.

Statuettes, busts, heads, and figurines are frequently displayed in the Oval Office. Abraham Lincoln has been the most common subject, in works by sculptors Augustus Saint-Gaudens, Gutzon Borglum, Adolph Alexander Weinman, Leo Cherne and others. Over time, traditional busts of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, or Benjamin Franklin have given way to heads of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman or Dwight Eisenhower. Western bronzes by Frederic Remington have been frequent choices: Lyndon Johnson displayed &quot;The Bronco Buster&quot;, as did Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump. Presidents Reagan and George H.W. Bush added its companion piece, &quot;The Rattlesnake&quot;.

==== Paintings ====
According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, an estimated 43 paintings and one photograph have decorated the walls of the Oval Office since 1961.

Franklin D. Roosevelt was the first president to occupy the Modern Oval Office, and placed Rembrandt Peale&#x27;s &quot;George Washington&quot; over the mantel. Assorted prints of the Hudson Valley hung on the walls.

President Harry S. Truman displayed works related to his home state of Missouri, prints of biplanes and sailing ships, and models of jet airplanes. A series of paintings held pride of place over the mantel, including Rembrandt Peale&#x27;s &quot;George Washington&quot;, Charles H. Woodbury&#x27;s &quot;Woodrow Wilson&quot;, Luis Cadena&#x27;s &quot;George Washington&quot; (the gift of Ecuador), and a copy of Tito Salas&#x27;s &quot;Equestrian Portrait of Simon Bolivar&quot; (the gift of Venezuela). A large photograph of the White House portrait of Franklin D. Roosevelt, under whom Truman had served as vice president and who died in office in 1945, hung beside the mantel and later beside his desk. He also displayed the painting &quot;Fired On&quot; by Western artist Frederic Remington.

President Dwight D. Eisenhower filled the office walls with landscape paintings, as well as a portrait of Robert E. Lee.

President John F. Kennedy surrounded himself with paintings of naval battles from the War of 1812, photographs of sailboats, and ship models.

President Lyndon Johnson installed sconces on either side of the mantel, and added the office&#x27;s first painting by a woman artist, &quot;Franklin D. Roosevelt&quot; by Elizabeth Shoumatoff.

President Richard Nixon tried three different portraits of George Washington over the mantel, and hung a copy of &quot;Earthrise&quot; – a photograph of the Earth taken from the Moon&#x27;s orbit during the Apollo 8 mission – beside his desk.

President Gerald Ford hung historic paintings, possibly in anticipation of the 1976 Bicentennial. Most of these works remained in place through the administrations of Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan.

President George H. W. Bush hung landscape paintings on the walls, along with three portraits: Rembrandt Peale&#x27;s &quot;George Washington&quot;, Charles Willson Peale&#x27;s &quot;Benjamin Henry Latrobe&quot;, and Thomas Sully&#x27;s &quot;Andrew Jackson&quot;.

President Bill Clinton chose the Childe Hassam and Norman Rockwell paintings mentioned above, along with &quot;Waiting for the Hour&quot; by William T. Carlton, a genre scene depicting African-Americans gathered in anticipation of the Emancipation Proclamation going into effect on January 1, 1863.

President George W. Bush mixed traditional works with paintings by Texas artists and Western sculptures. Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, British Prime Minister Tony Blair lent him a bust of Winston Churchill, who had guided the United Kingdom through World War II.

President Barack Obama honored Abraham Lincoln with the portrait by Story, a bust by Augustus Saint-Gaudens, and a copy of the Emancipation Proclamation. Below the proclamation was a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. by Charles Alston, and in the nearby bookcase was displayed a program from the August 28, 1963, March on Washington, at which King gave his &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech.

President Donald Trump hung mostly portraits on the office walls: Rembrandt Peale&#x27;s &quot;George Washington&quot;, George H. Story&#x27;s &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;, Asher B. Durand&#x27;s &quot;Andrew Jackson&quot;, George P. A. Healy&#x27;s &quot;Thomas Jefferson&quot;, John Trumbull&#x27;s &quot;Alexander Hamilton&quot;, Joseph-Siffred Duplessis&#x27;s &quot;Benjamin Franklin&quot;. He later substituted in other portraits: Rembrandt Peale&#x27;s &quot;Thomas Jefferson&quot; and Ralph E. W. Earl&#x27;s &quot;Andrew Jackson&quot;.

Former president Joe Biden&#x27;s Oval Office featured a cluster of five portraits at its north end, with Frank O. Salisbury&#x27;s &quot;Franklin D. Roosevelt&quot; given pride of place over the mantel. On the left of the Roosevelt, there are portraits of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, and on the right is Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton.
===Redecoration===
A tradition evolved in the latter part of the twentieth century of each new administration redecorating the office to the president&#x27;s liking. A new administration usually selects an oval carpet, new drapery, the paintings on the walls, and some furniture. Most incoming presidents continue using the rug of their predecessor until their new one is installed. The retired carpet very often is then moved to storage.

The redecoration of the Oval Office is usually coordinated by the first lady&#x27;s office in the East Wing, working with an interior designer and the White House curator.

===Alterations===

Since the present Oval Office&#x27;s construction in 1934 during the administration of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt the room has remained mostly unchanged architecturally. More than any president, Roosevelt left an impression on the room and its use. Doors and window frames have been modified slightly. A screen door on the east wall was removed after the installation of air conditioning. President Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s row of wire service Teletype machines on the southeast wall required cutting plaster and flooring to accommodate wiring. The Georgian style plaster ornament has been cleaned to remove accumulated paint, and a series of electrified wall sconces have come and gone.

Though some presidents have chosen to do day-to-day work in a smaller study just west of the Oval Office, most use the actual Oval Office for work and meetings. Traffic from the large numbers of staff, visitors, and pets over time takes its toll. There have been four sets of flooring in the Oval Office. The original floor was made of cork installed over softwood; however, President Eisenhower was an avid golfer and damaged the floor with his golf spikes. Johnson had the floor replaced in the mid-1960s with wood-grain linoleum. In 1982, President Ronald Reagan had the floor replaced with quarter sawn oak and walnut, in a cross parquet pattern similar in design to a 1933 Eric Gugler sketch, which had never been executed. In August 2005, the floor was replaced again under President George W. Bush, in exactly the same pattern as the Reagan floor.

===Conservation===
In the late 1980s, a comprehensive assessment of the entire house, including the Oval Office, was made as part of the National Park Service&#x27;s Historic American Buildings Survey . Detailed photographs and measured drawings were made documenting the interior and exterior and showing even slight imperfections. A checklist of materials and methods was generated for future conservation and restoration.

===Dimensions===
The ratio of the major axis to the minor axis is approximately 21:17 or 1.24.

<text>USS &quot;Raleigh&quot; (LPD-1), the lead ship of her class of amphibious transport docks, was the fourth ship of the United States Navy named for the capital of North Carolina, which in turn honors the English explorer Sir Walter Raleigh, the first to attempt the establishment of an English settlement in the United States of America.

Her keel was laid down by the New York Naval Shipyard of Brooklyn, New York, on 23 June 1960. She was launched on 17 March 1962 sponsored by Mrs. Terry Sanford, wife of the Governor of North Carolina, and commissioned on 8 September 1962.

She was decommissioned in 1991 after deploying for the Gulf War.

==Service history==

===1962–1969===
After fitting out through mid-December, &quot;Raleigh&quot; steamed to Norfolk, Virginia for the holiday season. In January 1963, she steamed for shakedown to Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, but returned to the building yard in late February for the correction of design deficiencies in her aviation gasoline system. Returning to Guantánamo in April, she completed shakedown, then assisted Commander, Amphibious Force, Atlantic in hosting the Navy League national convention in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

Returning to Norfolk on 1 June, &quot;Raleigh&quot; completed a week&#x27;s amphibious training at Little Creek, Virginia, and then deployed to the Caribbean Sea in July with Amphibious Squadron 8. &quot;Raleigh&quot; proved herself during this deployment by simultaneously landing troops and equipment by means of boats and amphibious vehicles from her well and by helicopters from her flight deck. During this cruise, she made one trip to Haiti as tension there rose.

&quot;Raleigh&quot; returned to Norfolk on 1 October and then underwent post-shakedown availability at New York City from 7 January 1964 through 13 March. During the spring she conducted amphibious training operations off Onslow Beach, North Carolina. Steaming for Europe on 12 October, &quot;Raleigh&quot; arrived off the coast of Spain and took part in &quot;Operation Steel Pike&quot;. She then called at Porto, Portugal, and Vigo, Spain, before returning to Norfolk on 27 November. After a yard period at the U.S. Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, Virginia, she deployed to the Caribbean on 1 April 1965 with the Amphibious Ready Squadron. From 25 April through 6 June, she operated off the Dominican Republic, evacuating 558 refugees who were later transferred to for transit to San Juan. For her part in the endeavor &quot;Raleigh&quot; and her crew received the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal. She returned to Norfolk on 29 June.

After upkeep and coastal training operations, &quot;Raleigh&quot; steamed for northern Europe on 27 August to participate in &quot;Bar Frost 65,&quot; a NATO amphibious exercise featuring a landing in Norway&#x27;s fjords north of the Arctic Circle. Returning to Norfolk on 23 October, she underwent a yard period through 4 April 1966, and then steamed for refresher training at Guantánamo Bay.

In April 1966, as part of the National Trials, the U.S. Navy operated a Hawker Siddeley Kestrel off the commando assault ship and were impressed with the aircraft. This then led to the Marines obtaining the Harrier AV-8A jump jet for use from their assault ships.

&quot;Raleigh&quot;″s deployments to the Caribbean from Norfolk as a unit of the Amphibious Ready Squadron averaged two per year up until 1970.

===1970–1979===
In July 1970 she began the first of a series of Mediterranean cruises, averaging one a year.

During the summer of 1971, &quot;Raleigh&quot; embarked Midshipman from the U.S. Naval Academy for a NATO/Training deployment to the North Atlantic. Ports of call were Lisbon, Portugal, Portsmouth, England and Copenhagen, Denmark.

Returning to Norfolk, &quot;Raleigh&quot; upgraded and refitted for her next deployment to the Mediterranean in February 1972. During that deployment, &quot;Raleigh&quot; and her Marines participated in a number of amphibious landing operations with British, Greek and Italian naval units. Returning to CONUS (Continental United States) in August 1972, the ship participated in several &quot;transportation&quot; deployments to various Naval Bases on the East Coast before her entry to the Berkley Shipyards in Norfolk, Virginia, for overhaul.

&quot;Raleigh&quot; departed Berkeley and went through refresher training at Guantanamo Bay in the spring of 1973. However a boiler casualty in No. 2 Engine Room forced her return to Norfolk. During transit from Cuba to Norfolk, the vessel was harassed by Cuban and Soviet aircraft for several days.

During the late fall of 1973, Captain Eugene Geronime relieved Captain Robert Crispin. In November of that year &quot;Raleigh&quot; deployed again to the Mediterranean, this time to link up with the Marine Amphibious Group sortied at Souda Bay, Crete. The combined Groups saw the largest Marine Force ever assembled in the Mediterranean up to that time. This was in response to the 1973 Arab-Israeli War in October. Following the cease fire, &quot;Raleigh&quot; maintained station in the Eastern Mediterranean to prevent Soviet expansion in that area. &quot;Raleigh&quot; returned to Little Creek, Virginia, in June 1974 for one of the biggest homecomings the ship ever received.

During the summer of 1974, &quot;Raleigh&quot; prepared for an extensive overhaul in Baltimore, Maryland, and following its first phase, she ran aground in Chesapeake Bay and returned to her homeport in Norfolk. During her second phase in the General Dynamics Shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts, a fire further disrupted her return to the Fleet.

On 18 April 1975 Captain John McIntyre took command and took her through an extended shakedown and two overseas deployments, including the evacuation of Americans from Beirut in May 1976, for which the ship and crew received the Humanitarian Service Medal. During the standup for the evacuation, &quot;Raleigh&quot; spent 105 consecutive days at sea in the Eastern Mediterranean in early 1976. Later that year, she participated in a Northern Europe amphibious demonstration deployment to Norway, after which Captain McIntyre and crew were feted upon their return to their Norfolk home port following almost two years of extensive operations.

After a yard period and extensive sea trials in summer of 1977 at Gitmo Cuba, &quot;Raleigh&quot; returned to Norfolk. In September 1977 &quot;Raleigh&quot; participated in &quot;Marg&quot; 2-77 (8 Sept 1977 to 13 March 1978) During this Med cruise she had ports of call in Rota and Malaga, Spain, Catania, Sicily, Genoa and Naples, Italy.

In August 1978 she embarked units of 2d Bn, 2d Mar, 2d MarDiv (Rein) at Moorehead City, North Carolina and sailed the North Atlantic to Europe. Her first stop was the Shetland Islands for ops with the British Army then to Copenhagen, Denmark where 2/2/2 disembarked for travel to then-West Germany by land to exercise with the Bundeswehr. After the conclusion of that exercise, she embarked the Marines at Bremerhaven and sailed for ports of call at Copenhagen and Edinburgh, Bergen Norway, Goteborg Sweden. &quot;Raleigh&quot; returned to Moorehead City in early October 1978 where the Marines were disembarked for return to Camp Lejeune. In early 1979 &quot;Raleigh&quot; steamed to Maryland shipbuilding &amp; drydock in Baltimore Maryland for another yard period.

===1980–1989===
1980 training session at Guatanamo Bay, Cuba. In January 1983, &quot;Raleigh&quot; set sail for duty with the ill-fated Multi-National Peace Keeping Force in Beirut, Lebanon. Departing Norfolk, she picked up 2nd Battalion, 6th Marines, at Morehead City, on 27 January, and returned to port on 29 June 1983. &quot;Raleigh&quot; loaded with Amtraks and Marines and steamed for Operation BIG PINE II (Ahuas Tara II), Honduras August 1983 – February 1984. The exercise also include Honduran soldiers that were embarked and taken ashore by CH-46 Sea Knights, Amtraks, and LCM-8s. Their return trip carried 101st Airborne soldiers.

In February – March 1984, USS Raleigh (LPD-1) took part in &quot;Teamwork &#x27;84&quot; which included US Navy and USMC personnel as well as forces from Canada, Belgium, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Germany, France, Norway and Denmark. During this time Raleigh crossed the arctic circle on 3/4/1984 at 010 degrees 20&#x27; E longitude. https://www.usmcu.edu/Portals/218/HD/Status%20of%20Forces/1976-1985/March-April%201984.pdf?ver=2019-03-27-091937-123&amp;timestamp=1553694952187

In 1984 the ship participated in JLOTs (Joint Logistics Over the Shore) which was a test of the Navy&#x27;s ability to supply troops on the beach from container ships off shore. In 1985 she went into the ship yards in Charleston, South Carolina and then to Guantanamo Bay for training exercises. In 1986 she went to the North Atlantic, steaming by Iceland and then to Norway&#x27;s fjords to practice amphibious assaults and transit exercises. In August 1986, the amphibious transport dock set sail for Operation Northern Wedding Bold Guard and LF6F with MSSG-22 on board. An infantry company from the ground combat element of the MAU was also on board. MSSG-22 was part of the 22nd MAU (SOC). The vessel returned from her deployment in February 1987. In the same year she was part of an operation in the Mediterranean Sea. In 1987 and again in 1988–89, &quot;Raleigh&quot; cruised the Persian Gulf as part of a mine countermeasures group. During Operation Earnest Will helicopters from her deck caught an Iranian AJR laying mines in an &quot;incident.&quot; &quot;Raleigh&quot; played a major role in the Gulf.

===First Gulf War, 1990–1991===
The USS &quot;Raleigh&quot; cruise book (USN ships often produce one) for Operations Desert Shield/Desert Storm has it that the ship completed the operation on 17 April 1991. She left Morehead City in August 1990.

The assigned LCU was &quot;LCU-1663&quot;. Embarked Marine units included the command staff of 1st Bn, 10th Marines, the command staff of 3rd Bn, 2nd Marines, including 34th Commandant of the Marine Corps James T. Conway and significant combat elements that included combat engineers, LAADs, AAVs, TOWs, tanks of 2nd Tk Bn, and I Btry 3rd Bn 12th Marines, attached to the 10th Marines, among others.

&quot;Raleigh&quot; transited the Suez Canal in late August or early September. The initial watch was to stay in the North Arabian Sea. She was involved in a number of exercises in Oman under the name &quot;Sea Soldier&quot;. Subsequently, she supported mine countermeasures missions operations off Kuwait City, and used six AH-1W Sea Cobra attack helicopters in CAP missions.

===Decommissioning and fate===
&quot;Raleigh&quot; was decommissioned on 13 December 1991, was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 25 January 1992, and disposed of as a target on 4 December 1994.

<doc id="230337" wikidata="Q464876" url="?curid=230337" title="Robert Morris (financier)">
<text>Robert Morris Jr. (January 20, 1734May 8, 1806) was an English-born American merchant, investor and politician who was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. He served as a member of the Pennsylvania legislature, the Second Continental Congress, and the United States Senate, and was one of only two people who signed the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, and the United States Constitution (the other being Roger Sherman). From 1781 to 1784, he served as the Superintendent of Finance of the United States, becoming known as the &quot;Financier of the Revolution.&quot; Along with Alexander Hamilton and Albert Gallatin, he is widely regarded as one of the founders of the financial system of the United States.

Born in Liverpool, Morris was brought to North America by his father when he was 13 years old, quickly becoming a partner in a successful shipping firm based in Philadelphia. In the aftermath of the French and Indian War, Morris joined with other merchants in opposing British tax policies such as the 1765 Stamp Act. By 1775 he was the richest man in America. After the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, he helped procure arms and ammunition for the revolutionary cause, and in late 1775 he was chosen as a delegate to the Second Continental Congress. As a member of Congress, he served on the Secret Committee of Trade, which handled the procurement of supplies, the Committee of Correspondence, which handled foreign affairs, and the Marine Committee, which oversaw the Continental Navy. Morris was a leading member of Congress until he resigned in 1778. Out of office, Morris refocused on his merchant career and won election to the Pennsylvania Assembly, where he became a leader of the &quot;Republican&quot; faction that sought alterations to the Pennsylvania Constitution.

Facing a difficult financial situation in the ongoing Revolutionary War, in 1781 Congress established the position of Superintendent of Finance to oversee financial matters. Morris accepted appointment as Superintendent of Finance and also served as Agent of Marine, from which he controlled the Continental Navy. He helped provide supplies to the Continental Army under General George Washington, enabling, with the help of frequent collaborator Haym Salomon, the decisive victory in the Battle of Yorktown. Morris also reformed government contracting and established the Bank of North America, the first congressionally chartered national bank to operate in the United States. Morris believed that the national government would be unable to achieve financial stability without the power to levy taxes and tariffs, but he was unable to convince all thirteen states to agree to an amendment to the Articles of Confederation. Frustrated by the weakness of the national government, Morris resigned as Superintendent of Finance in 1784. Morris was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1786.

In 1787, Morris was selected as a delegate to the Philadelphia Convention, which wrote and proposed a new constitution for the United States. Morris rarely spoke during the convention, but the constitution produced by the convention reflected many of his ideas. Morris and his allies helped ensure that Pennsylvania ratified the new constitution, and the document was ratified by the requisite number of states by the end of 1788. The Pennsylvania legislature subsequently elected Morris as one of its two inaugural representatives in the United States Senate. Morris declined Washington&#x27;s offer to serve as the nation&#x27;s first Treasury Secretary, instead suggesting Alexander Hamilton for the position. In the Senate, Morris supported Hamilton&#x27;s economic program and aligned with the Federalist Party. During and after his service in the Senate, Morris went deeply into debt through speculating on land, leading into the Panic of 1796–1797. Unable to pay his creditors, he was confined in the Prune Street debtors&#x27; apartment adjacent to Walnut Street Prison from 1798 to 1801. After being released from prison, he lived a quiet, private life in a modest home in Philadelphia until his death in 1806.

==Early life==
===Youth===

Morris was born in Liverpool, England, on January 20, 1734. His parents were Robert Morris Sr., an agent for a shipping firm, and Elizabeth Murphet; biographer Charles Rappleye concludes that Morris was probably born out of wedlock. Until he reached the age of thirteen, Morris was raised by his maternal grandmother in England. In 1747, Morris immigrated to Oxford, Maryland, where his father had prospered in the tobacco trade. Two years later, Morris&#x27;s father sent him to Philadelphia, then the most populous city in British North America, where Morris lived under the care of his father&#x27;s friend, Charles Greenway.

===Merchant career===
Greenway arranged for Morris to become an apprentice at the shipping and banking firm of Philadelphia merchant Charles Willing. In 1750, Robert Morris Sr. died from an infected wound, leaving much of his substantial estate to his son. Morris impressed Willing and rose from a teenage trainee to become a key agent in Willing&#x27;s firm. Morris traveled to Caribbean ports to expand the firm&#x27;s business, and he gained a knowledge of trading and the various currencies used to exchange goods. He also befriended Thomas Willing, the oldest son of Charles Willing who was two years older than Morris and who, like Morris, had split his life between England and British North America. Charles Willing died in 1754, and in 1757 Thomas made Morris a full partner in the newly renamed firm of Willing Morris &amp; Company.

Morris&#x27;s shipping firm was just one of many such firms operating in Philadelphia, but Willing, Morris &amp; Co. pursued several innovative strategies. The firm pooled with other shipping firms to insure vessels, aggressively expanded trade with India, and underwrote government projects through bonds and promissory notes. Ships of the firm traded with India, the Levant, the West Indies, Spanish Cuba, Spain, and Italy. The firm&#x27;s business of import, export, and general agency made it one of the most prosperous in Pennsylvania. In 1784, Morris, with other investors, underwrote the voyage of the ship &quot;Empress of China&quot;, the first American vessel to visit the Chinese mainland.

====Slavery====

Morris&#x27;s partnership with Willing was established just after the outbreak of the French and Indian War, which hindered the usual supply of indentured servants from the British Isles to Pennsylvania. The most direct effect on the supply was action by Parliament to forbid immigration to the Americans, and simultaneously promote the slave trade. Many potential servants had been conscripted by the British Army to fight in Continental Europe, and a significant portion of the servants already in Pennsylvania were nearing the ends of their contracts. As such, there was a rapidly increasing demand in Pennsylvania for a supply of new slaves to compensate for the ongoing labor shortage. While Morris was a junior partner in the firm and Willing was pursuing a political career, Willing, Morris &amp; Co. co-signed a petition calling for the repeal of Pennsylvania&#x27;s tariff on imported slaves. In 1762, approximately 200 slaves were imported into Philadelphia, at the height of Pennsylvania&#x27;s involvement in the Atlantic slave trade; most were brought in by Rhode Island merchants Mark Anthony DeWolf, Aaron Lopez, and Jacob Rivera.

As part of their commercial operations, Willing, Morris &amp; Co. engaged in the slave trade. The firm advertised slave sales and directed company ships to purchase slaves from Africa to sell in British North America. One of the first ships the firm purchased, &quot;Nancy&quot;, was used to make two voyages to Africa to purchase slaves; the first voyage occurred in 1762, and resulted in the sale of approximately 170 slaves purchased from the Gold Coast in Wilmington, North Carolina. Though it was profitable, this voyage did not make a large profit, and a second slave-trading voyage by &quot;Nancy&quot; resulted in her capture by French privateers. Willing, Morris &amp; Co. also handled two slave auctions for other importers of slaves, offering 23 slaves for sale. Three years later, the firm advertised 17 slaves for sale who were brought from Africa onboard the slave ship &quot;Marquis de Granby&quot;. The slaves were not sold in Philadelphia, as the owner took the ship and all the slaves to Jamaica. This was the last time Willing, Morris &amp; Co. was involved in slave trade. During the Revolution Morris employed a French chief, and afterwards engaged a former slave under terms of indenture.

==Personal and family life==
In early 1769, at age 35, Morris married 20-year-old Mary White, the daughter of a wealthy and prestigious lawyer and landholder. Mary gave birth to the couple&#x27;s first of seven children in December 1769. (One son was Congressman Thomas Morris, whose wife was related to the Livingston and Van Rensselaer New York political families). Morris and his family lived on Front Street in Philadelphia and maintained a second home, known as &quot;The Hills,&quot; on the Schuylkill River to the northwest of the city. He later purchased another rural manor, which he named Morrisville, that was located across the Delaware River from Trenton, New Jersey. The Morrises worshiped at the Anglican Christ Church, which was also attended by Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Willing, and other leading citizens of Philadelphia. The Morris household employed several domestic workers and retained several slaves.

In addition to the children he had with Mary White, Morris fathered a daughter, Polly, out of wedlock around 1763. Morris supported Polly financially and remained in contact with her throughout her adult life. Morris also supported a younger half-brother, Thomas, whom Morris&#x27;s father had sired out of wedlock shortly before his own death. Thomas eventually became a partner in Morris&#x27;s shipping firm.

Mary&#x27;s brother, William White, was ordained as an Episcopal priest and served as the Senate chaplain.

In 1781, Morris purchased a home on Market Street that was two blocks north of Independence Hall, the seat of the Second Continental Congress. He gained clear title to the estate in 1785 and made it his primary residence. In 1790, President George Washington accepted Morris&#x27;s offer to make the house his primary residence; Morris and his family subsequently moved to a smaller, neighboring property. By the 1790s, Morris had become close friends with Washington, and he and his wife were regular fixtures at state events thrown by the president. The President&#x27;s House, as it became known, served as the residence of the president until 1800, when President John Adams moved to the White House in Washington, D.C.

==American Revolution==

===Rising tensions with Britain===

In 1765, the Parliament of Great Britain imposed the Stamp Act, a tax on transactions involving paper that proved widely unpopular in British North America. In one of his first major political acts, Morris joined with several other merchants in pressuring British agent John Hughes to refrain from collecting the new tax. Facing colonial resistance, Parliament repealed the tax, but it later implemented other policies designed to generate tax revenue from the colonies. During the decade after the imposition of the Stamp Act, Morris would frequently join with other merchants in protesting many of Parliament&#x27;s taxation policies. Writing to a friend about his objections to British tax policies, Morris stated that &quot;I am a native of England but from principle am American in this dispute.&quot; While his partner, Thomas Willing, served in various governmental positions, Morris declined to serve in any public office other than that of port warden (a position he shared with six other individuals), and he generally let Willing act as the public face of the firm.
In early 1774, in response to the Intolerable Acts, many colonists in British North America began calling for a boycott of British goods. In Philadelphia, Willing, Charles Thomson, and John Dickinson took the lead in calling for a congress of all the colonies to coordinate a response to British tax policies. Morris was not elected to the First Continental Congress, which convened in Philadelphia in August 1774, but he frequently met with the congressional delegates and befriended colonial leaders such as George Washington and John Jay. Morris generally sympathized with the position of the delegates who favored the reform of British policies but were unwilling to fully break with Britain. In September 1774, the First Continental Congress voted to create the Continental Association, an agreement to enforce a boycott against British goods beginning in December; it also advised each colony to establish committees to enforce the boycott. Morris was elected to the Philadelphia committee charged with enforcing the boycott.

===Continental Congress===
====Early war, 1775–August 1776====

In April 1775, the American Revolutionary War broke out following the Battles of Lexington and Concord. Shortly thereafter, the Second Continental Congress began meeting in Philadelphia, and Congress appointed George Washington to command the Continental Army. The Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly established the twenty-five member Committee of Safety to supervise defenses, and Morris was appointed to the committee. Morris became part of the core group of members that directed the committee and served as the committee&#x27;s chairman when Benjamin Franklin was absent. Charged with obtaining gunpowder, Morris arranged a large-scale smuggling operation to avoid British laws designed to prevent arms and ammunition from being imported into the colonies. Due to his success at smuggling gunpowder for Pennsylvania, Morris also became the chief supplier of gunpowder to the Continental Army. Morris became increasingly focused on political affairs rather than business, and in October 1775 he won election to the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly. Later in the year, the Provincial Assembly elected Morris as a delegate to Congress.

In Congress, Morris aligned with the less radical faction of delegates that protested British policies but continued to favor reconciliation with Britain. He was appointed to the Secret Committee of Trade, which supervised the procurement of arms and ammunition. As the revolutionary government lacked an executive branch or a civil service, the committees of Congress handled all government business. Biographer Charles Rappleye writes that the committee &quot;handled its contracts in a clubby, often incestuous manner&quot; that may have unfairly benefited politically connected merchants, including Morris. However, Rappleye also notes that the dangerous and secretive nature of a committee charged with obtaining contraband goods made it difficult for the committee to establish competitive bidding procedures for procurement contracts. In addition to his service on the Secret Committee of Trade, Morris was also appointed to the Marine Committee, which oversaw the Continental Navy, and the Committee of Secret Correspondence, which oversaw efforts to establish relations with foreign powers. From his position on the latter committee, Morris helped arrange for the appointment of Silas Deane as Congress&#x27;s representative to France; Deane was charged with procuring supplies and securing a formal alliance with France.

Throughout 1776, Morris would emerge as a key figure on the Marine Committee; Rappleye describes him as the &quot;de facto commander&quot; of the Continental Navy. Morris favored a naval strategy of attacking Britain&#x27;s &quot;defenseless places&quot; in an effort to divide Britain&#x27;s numerically superior fleet. Along with Franklin, Dickinson, and John Adams, Morris helped draft the Model Treaty, which was designed to serve as a template for relations with foreign countries. Unlike Britain&#x27;s mercantile trade policies, the Model Treaty emphasized the importance of free trade. In March 1776, after the death of Samuel Ward, Morris was named as the chairman of the Secret Committee of Trade. He established a network of agents, based in both the colonies and various foreign ports, charged with procuring supplies for the Continental war effort.

In late February 1776, Americans learned that the British Parliament had passed the Prohibitory Act, which declared that all American shipping was subject to seizure by British ships. Unlike many other congressional leaders, Morris continued to hope for reconciliation with Britain, since he believed that all-out war still lacked the strong support of a majority of Americans and would prove financially ruinous. In June 1776, due largely to frustration with the moderate faction of Pennsylvania leaders that included Morris, a convention of delegates from across Pennsylvania began meeting to draft a new constitution and establish a new state government. At the same time, Congress was debating whether to formally declare independence from Britain. By early July 1776, Pennsylvania&#x27;s delegation was the lone congressional delegation opposed to declaring independence because that delegation was sent to the Congress with instructions from the Quaker dominated Assembly not to vote for independence. Morris acted on these instructions, but he and another Pennsylvania delegate agreed to excuse themselves from the vote on independence, thereby giving the pro-independence movement a majority in the Pennsylvania delegation. With Morris absent, all congressional delegations voted to pass a resolution declaring independence on July 2, and the United States formally declared independence on July 4, 1776.

Despite his opposition to independence, and much to Morris&#x27;s surprise, the Pennsylvania constitutional convention voted to keep Morris in Congress; he was the lone anti-independence delegate from Pennsylvania to retain his position. In August, Morris signed the Declaration of Independence despite having abstained. In explaining his decision, he stated, &quot;I am not one of those politicians that run testy when my own plans are not adopted. I think it is the duty of a good citizen to follow when he cannot lead.&quot; He also stated, &quot;while I do not wish to see my countrymen die on the field of battle nor do I wish to see them live in tyranny&quot;.

====Continued war, August 1776–1778====
After the Declaration of Independence was issued, Morris continued to supervise and coordinate efforts to secure arms and ammunition and export American goods. His strategy focused on using ships from New England to export tobacco and other goods from the Southern states to Europe and the islands of the Caribbean, then using the capital obtained from those exports to purchase military supplies from Europe. British spies and warships often frustrated his plans, and many American ships were captured in the midst of trading operations. In response, Morris authorized American envoys in Europe to commission privateers to attack British shipping, and he arranged for an agent, William Bingham, to pay for repairs to American privateers on the French island of Martinique. Due to the lucrative nature of privateering, Morris also started outfitting his own privateers. Another agent of Morris&#x27;s, his half-brother Thomas Morris, proved a disastrous choice for managing American privateers in Europe, as Thomas engaged in binge drinking and mismanaged funds. In October 1776, at the urging of Morris and Benjamin Franklin, Congress authorized the appointment of two envoys charged with seeking a formal treaty of alliance with France; ultimately, Benjamin Franklin and Arthur Lee were appointed as those envoys. Along with Silas Deane, Franklin would help to greatly expand arms shipments from France and Spain, but Lee proved to be completely incompetent in his efforts to gain support from Prussia and the Habsburg monarchy.

In early December 1776, Washington&#x27;s army was forced to retreat across the Delaware River and into Pennsylvania, and most members of Congress temporarily left Philadelphia. Morris was one of few delegates to remain in the city, and Congress appointed Morris and two other delegates to &quot;execute Continental business&quot; in its absence. Morris frequently corresponded with Washington, and he provided supplies that helped enable the Continental victory at the Battle of Trenton. After the Continental Army was defeated in the September 1777 Battle of Brandywine, Congress fled west from Philadelphia; Morris and his family went to live at the estate they had recently purchased in Manheim, Pennsylvania. Morris obtained a leave of absence in late 1777, but he spent much of his time defending himself against attacks regarding alleged mismanagement and financial improprieties levied by the pro-slavery allies of Henry Laurens, the president of the Continental Congress. Due to his leave of absence, Morris did not play a large role in drafting the Articles of Confederation, which would be the first constitution of the United States, but he signed the document in March 1778. As some states objected to the Articles, it would not enter into force until 1781.

Morris returned to Congress in May 1778 to vote for a measure to provide pensions to Continental Army officers. He formed a close working relationship with Gouverneur Morris (no relation), a young New York congressman who shared many of Robert Morris&#x27;s views. The following month, Morris returned with Congress to Philadelphia, which had been evacuated by the British. Morris did not resume his wide array of duties in Congress, seeking instead to wind down his projects so that he could focus on business. In late 1778, Morris won election to the state assembly as part of a slate of candidates that favored reforming the Pennsylvania constitution; he resigned from Congress to take up his seat. After Morris left Congress, Henry Laurens, Thomas Paine, and some other members of Congress continued their false attacks on him for allegedly using his position in Congress for his own financial benefit, but in early 1779 a congressional committee cleared Morris of all charges.

===Out of Congress, 1779–1781===

With their plans to call a new state constitutional convention frustrated by Joseph Reed and others, Morris and James Wilson founded the Republican Society, a political club devoted to implementing a new state constitution. The Republican Society favored a bicameral legislature, a state executive with veto power, an independent judiciary, and an end to loyalty oaths to the state government. These oaths were designed to disenfranchise Quakers, Anabaptists, Jewish people, and other religious minorities. Other prominent Pennsylvanians, including Wilson, Benjamin Rush, Thomas Mifflin, and Charles Thomson, supported the Republican Society&#x27;s goals, but Morris became the de facto leader of the faction that became known as the Republicans. Meanwhile, those who favored maintaining the state constitution became known as the Constitutionalists.

Due to rising inflation, in mid-1779 the Constitutionalists established a committee to implement price controls; numerous Philadelphia merchants were arrested for allegedly violating the committee&#x27;s orders, but Morris avoided imprisonment and emerged as a leading opponent of the committee. The price control committee proved ineffective and disbanded in September, but the following month a mob rioted and seized several Republican leaders. Morris and other Republicans sheltered at James Wilson&#x27;s house, where they were rescued by Reed and a detachment of the Continental Army. Wilson fled the city after the riot, and popular anger at merchants resulted in Morris&#x27;s defeat in his campaign for re-election to the state legislature.

Out of public office for the first time since the start of the American Revolution, Morris focused on expanding his shipping business. He partnered with several out-of-state businessmen, including Jonathan Hudson of Maryland and Carter Braxton and Benjamin Harrison of Virginia, to form what biographer Charles Rappleye calls &quot;the first national conglomerate.&quot; In these trading ventures, Morris often provided financing and oversight but left the details to his partners. With national finances in tatters, Morris led a group of merchants in creating the Bank of Pennsylvania, which provided funding for the purchase of supplies by the Continental Army. The bank did not engage in the full range of modern banking activities, but it did accept deposits and provide a potential model for monetary reforms at the national level. The success of the bank provided a boost to Morris&#x27;s popularity, and in October 1780, he won election to the state legislature.William Bingham, rumored to be the richest man in America after the Revolutionary War, purchased 9.5% of the available shares of the Bank of North America. The greatest share, however, 63.3%, was purchased on behalf of the United States government by Robert Morris, using a gift in the form of a loan from France and a loan from Netherlands. This had the effect of capitalizing the bank with large deposits of gold and silver coin and bills of exchange. He then issued new paper currency backed by this supply.

===Superintendent of Finance===
====First months====
In the midst of the American Revolutionary War, U.S. government finances fell into a poor state as Congress lacked the power to raise revenue and the states largely refused to furnish funding. Without a mechanism for raising revenue, Congress repeatedly issued paper money, leading to rampant inflation. By 1781, the U.S. faced an unremitting financial crisis, which was underscored by the January 1781 Pennsylvania Line Mutiny, in which ten poorly fed, unpaid Continental Army regiments demanded better conditions from Congress. Though the mutiny was put down, it convinced Congress to implement reforms that created the departments of war, marine, finance, and foreign affairs, each of which would be led by a departmental executive. By a unanimous vote, Congress selected Morris as the Superintendent of Finance. Morris accepted appointment as the Superintendent of Finance in May 1781, and he appointed Gouverneur Morris as his deputy.

Morris soon emerged as the key economic official in the country and became a leader of the Nationalist faction, an informal group of American leaders who favored a stronger national government. He also had effective control over foreign affairs until Robert R. Livingston was appointed as Secretary of Foreign Affairs later in the year. In September 1781, Morris reluctantly agreed to serve as the Agent of Marine, giving him civilian leadership of the Continental Navy. Congress filled the last of the executive positions in November, when Benjamin Lincoln accepted appointment as Secretary of War. Along with General Washington and Continental Congress secretary Charles Thomson, the three executives served as the leaders of the de facto first national executive branch in U.S. history; Morris assumed an unofficial role as the leading department secretary. All three executives, as well as Washington, aligned with the Nationalist faction, and they all cooperated to enhance the power of the national government. In mid-1782, Congress established standing committees to provide oversight to the executive departments; Morris supported the congressional reorganization, but to his dismay, his longtime foe Arthur Lee became the chairman of the committee overseeing the finance department.

Morris pursued an array of reforms designed to boost the economy; many of the reforms were inspired by the laissez-faire economic ideas of Adam Smith. Shortly after taking office, he convinced Congress to establish the Bank of North America, the first bank to operate in the United States. Such a bank had been discussed in the months prior to Morris&#x27;s appointment, but the bank itself was organized along lines laid out by Robert Morris and Gouverneur Morris. It was established as a private institution governed by its investors but was subject to inspection by the Superintendent of Finance. The bank would take the national government&#x27;s deposits, provide loans to Congress, and issue banknotes. Morris hoped that the bank would help finance the war, stabilize the nation&#x27;s currency, and bring the country together under one unified monetary policy. As the bank would take some time to begin functioning, in 1781 Morris presided over the issuing of a new currency, referred to as &quot;Morris notes,&quot; backed by Morris&#x27;s own funds. Morris also convinced Congress to allow him to purchase all supplies for the Continental Army, and Congress required states to furnish funding rather than supplying goods like flour or meat.

By 1781, the Revolutionary War had become a stalemate between Britain and the United States. The British had concentrated their military operations in the Southern theater of the war, while leaving a large force garrisoned at New York City. In August 1781, Morris met with General Washington and the comte de Rochambeau, who were planning a joint Franco-American operation against the British forces. Morris raised over $1,400,000 on his own credit for the effort. He also redirected government funds to purchase supplies for Washington&#x27;s march against British forces in Virginia, and he pleaded with state governments and the French government for further funding, with the final $20,000 needed coming from Morris&#x27;s longtime collaborator, Haym Salomon. At the October 1781 Battle of Yorktown, Washington forced the surrender of the British army under the command of General Cornwallis. After the Battle of Yorktown, Britain essentially abandoned its campaign on land, but the naval war continued as Britain sought to cut the United States off from its sources of trade.

===After Yorktown===

Months after the Battle of Yorktown, Morris issued the &quot;Report on Public Credit,&quot; an ambitious economic plan calling for the full payment of the country&#x27;s war debt through new revenue measures. It included a head tax on slaves in the various states, but above all, he pushed for a federal tariff of five percent on all imported goods, which would require an amendment to the recently approved Articles of Confederation. Such an amendment would weaken the institution of slavery, and greatly strengthen the power of the national government, but the amendment process required the consent of each state, and many states were reluctant to alter the balance of power between the states and the national government. The Articles gave Congress the sole power to conduct foreign policy, but the states retained all power over funding; Congress had no independent power to raise funds, and lacked any mechanism to force states provide the funds that they owed to Congress. Writing to the state governors, Morris argued that it was &quot;high time to reliever ourselves from the infamy we have already sustained, and to rescue and restore the national credit. This can only be done by solid revenue.&quot; By late 1782, all of the states but Rhode Island had agreed to back an amendment allowing the tariff, but that was enough to block the amendment. At that point in time Rhode Island was a slave state with over 3000 slaves, and some prominent citizens of that state were prolific slave traders, so Morris&#x27;s proposals would have a double impact.

Though he was frustrated in the tariff battle, Morris continued to implement and propose other economic reforms. In January 1782, after receiving its charter from Congress, the Bank of North America commenced operations, and the bank&#x27;s currency soon achieved wide circulation. Morris sought the establishment of a national mint to provide for a single coinage throughout the United States and proposed the first decimal currency, but Congress was unwilling to back this project. He appointed several receivers, including Alexander Hamilton, to help circulate banknotes, report on the prices of goods, and perform other functions in places throughout the United States. He also reformed government procurement of supplies, saving money by placing the onus for the storage and transport of supplies on government contractors.

===Newburgh Conspiracy===
Even after implementing several financial reforms, Morris was unable to pay the soldiers of the Continental Army. The chief issue, aside from the unwillingness of the states to amend the Articles of Confederation, was the unwillingness of the states to supply adequate funding; many states refused to furnish any funds at all. The Bank of North America provided some loans, but eventually refused to furnish more funds until previous loans were paid off. Morris&#x27;s efforts were further complicated by France&#x27;s reluctance to extend more loans, as well as a drop-off in American trade, caused in part by British naval operations. In December 1782, shortly after the apparent defeat of the proposed amendment to allow the national government to levy a tariff, General Alexander McDougall led a delegation that presented a petition for immediate payment on behalf of the Continental Army. While Morris helped temporarily defuse the crisis by offering the soldiers one month&#x27;s pay, the petition reflected widespread unhappiness in the Continental Army at the continued lack of pay. Some Nationalists, including Gouverneur Morris, believed that only the discontent of the army could force the adoption of the amendment authorizing Congress to impose a tariff.

In March, Colonel Walter Stewart delivered the &quot;Newburgh Address,&quot; in which he urged members of the Continental Army to rise up against Congress and demand payment. Washington prevented a mutiny by assuring the soldiers that they would eventually be paid. In the aftermath of the near-mutiny, Morris denied that he had played any role in fomenting insurrection. Nonetheless, most historians believe that Morris was one of three leaders of the &quot;Newburgh Conspiracy, along with Alexander Hamilton and Gouverneur Morris. Jack N. Rakove emphasizes the leadership of Robert Morris. However, this conclusion overlooks several exculpatory facts: 1) Morris supplied $800,000 in his own notes to pay the soldiers in an effort to avoid discontent in the Army, 2) The address was written by Major Armstrong, General Gate&#x27;s aide-de-camp, both of whom were anti-Morris partisans, 3) Armstrong went on to become a favorite of the Constitutionalists of Pennsylvania, who later made him their Clerk of the Assembly, 4) Morris&#x27;s most bitter enemy, Arthur Lee, promoted articles published by anonymous partisans (probably Lee himself) in the Freeman&#x27;s Journal, attacking Morris. Blaming Morris had all the ear-marks of an early misinformation campaign designed to shift the blame for a failed and unpopular mutiny.

===National debt===

Frustrated by his defeat in the tariff battle and the failure of states to provide adequate funding, Morris thought he was being forced to run up debts that the states were unwilling to pay. Writing that he would not be the &quot;Minister of Injustice&quot;, he submitted his resignation in early 1783, but Hamilton and other Nationalists convinced him to stay in office.
As of January 1, 1783, the public debt was $42 million of which 18.77 percent was foreign debt and 81.23 percent was owned at home.In a report to the President of Congress Morris wrote:
* Domestic Debt...$35,327,769
of which
* Loan Certificates...$11,463,802 [with two years interest loan due $877,828]
* Army Debt...$635,618.00
The rest being unliquidated debts, etc., interest.
At roughly the same time, Morris and others in Philadelphia learned that the United States and Britain had signed a preliminary peace agreement, bringing an unofficial end to the Revolutionary War. Congress approved a furlough of the Continental Army soldiers, subject to recall in case hostilities broke out once again. Morris distributed &quot;Morris notes&quot; to the remaining soldiers, but many soldiers departed for their homes rather than waiting for the notes. After a mutiny over pay broke out in Pennsylvania, Congress voted to leave Philadelphia and establish a provincial capital in Princeton, New Jersey; the mutiny dissipated shortly thereafter. Nationalists were devastated by this turn of events, and Hamilton resigned from Congress in mid-1783 after his proposal for convention to revise the Articles of Confederation was ignored.

In November 1784, Morris resigned from his government positions. Rather than finding a successor for Morris, Congress established the three-member Board of Treasury, consisting of Arthur Lee, William Livingston, and Samuel Osgood. In 1778–1779 Morris had attempted to strengthen out the accounts of the old Commercial Committee but had to give it up; he stated in answer to Paine &quot;the accounts of Willing and Morris with the committee had been partially settled, but were still partially open, because the transactions could not be closed up.&quot; The Treasury Board elected in 1794-1795 those old accounts were brought to a settlement—a June 1796 entry in the Treasury debt against Morris for $93,312.63. Morris would explain in 1800 in debtors&#x27; prison that in fact the debt was due not just to himself but also his partners John Ross and Thomas Willing.

==Later political career==

===Constitutional Convention===

After leaving office, Morris once again devoted himself to business, but state and federal politics remained a factor in his life. After the Pennsylvania legislature stripped the Bank of North America of its charter, Morris won election to the state legislature and helped restore the bank&#x27;s charter. Meanwhile, the United States suffered a sustained recession after the end of the Revolutionary War, caused by the lingering debt burden and new restrictions on trade imposed by the European powers. Some members of Congress, including those on the Board of Treasury, continued to favor amendments to the Articles of Confederation, but the states still refused to authorize major changes to the Articles.

In 1786, Morris was one of five Pennsylvania delegates selected to attend the Annapolis Convention, where delegates discussed ways to reform the Articles of Confederation. Though Morris ultimately declined to attend the convention, the delegates convinced Congress to authorize a convention in Philadelphia in May 1787 to amend the Articles. The Pennsylvania state legislature sent a delegation consisting of Morris, James Wilson, Gouverneur Morris, George Clymer, Thomas Mifflin, Jared Ingersoll, and Ben Franklin to the Philadelphia Convention. With the exception of Franklin (who avoided aligning with either political faction in Pennsylvania), all of the Pennsylvania delegates were closely aligned with Morris&#x27;s Republican faction, a reflection of Republican strength in the state legislature. Many of Morris&#x27;s Nationalist allies from other states, including Hamilton, James Madison, John Dickinson, and Washington, would also attend the convention.

With Franklin ill, Morris opened the proceedings of the Philadelphia Convention on May 25. His motion to nominate Washington as chairman of the convention was backed by a unanimous vote. Morris consistently attended the meeting of the convention, but rarely spoke after the first day, instead allowing lawyers and others more experienced with the law to debate various issues. His primary goals, including a provision ensuring the federal government had the power to lay tariffs and taxes, were shared by the vast majority of delegates at the convention. On September 17, Morris signed the final document produced by the convention which, rather than amending the Articles, was intended to supplant the Articles as the new Constitution of the United States. Morris was one of just six individuals to sign both the Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution.

Rather than seeking to block the new constitution, Congress simply forwarded it to each state to debate ratification. Morris&#x27;s Republican faction, along with Federalist groups in other states, sought the ratification of the new federal Constitution. The Constitutionalists, who saw the new federal constitution as a threat to state sovereignty, joined with Anti-Federalists in other states in seeking to prevent the ratification of the Constitution. In elections held in October and November 1787, Morris&#x27;s Federalist allies retained control of the state legislature and won a majority of the elections held to select delegates for the convention held to debate ratification of the Constitution. Due to a dispute with a business partner, Morris did not attend the ratification convention, which voted to ratify the Constitution in December 1787. By the end of 1788, the Constitution had been ratified by enough states to take effect. In September 1788, the Pennsylvania legislature elected Robert Morris and William Maclay, both of whom were aligned with the Federalists, as the state&#x27;s first representatives in the United States Senate.

===U.S. Senator===
In the country&#x27;s first presidential election, Washington was elected as the President of the United States. Washington offered the position of Secretary of the Treasury to Morris, but Morris declined the offer, instead suggesting Alexander Hamilton for the position. In the Senate, Morris pressed for many of the same policies he had sought as Superintendent of Finance: a federal tariff, a national bank, a federal mint, and the funding of the national debt. Congress agreed to implement the Tariff of 1789, which created a uniform impost on goods carried by foreign ships into American ports, but many other issues lingered into 1790. Among those issues were the site of the national capital and the fate of state debts. Morris sought the return of the nation&#x27;s capital to Philadelphia and the federal assumption of state debts. Morris defeated Maclay&#x27;s proposal to establish the capital in Pennsylvania at a site on the Susquehanna River west of Philadelphia, but James Madison defeated Morris&#x27;s attempt to establish the capital just outside of Philadelphia.

Morris&#x27;s 1781 &quot;Report On Public Credit&quot; supplied the basis for Hamilton&#x27;s &quot;First Report on the Public Credit&quot;, which Hamilton submitted in 1790. Hamilton proposed to fully fund all federal debts and assume all state debts, and to pay for those debts by issuing new federal bonds. Hamilton argued that these measures would restore confidence in public credit and help to revitalize the economy, but opponents attacked his proposals as unfairly beneficial to the speculators who had purchased many of the government&#x27;s debt certificates. Morris supported Hamilton&#x27;s economic proposals, but the two differed on the site of the federal capital, as Hamilton wanted to keep it in New York. In June 1790, Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson convinced Morris, Hamilton, and Madison to agree to a compromise in which the federal government assumed state debts, while a new federal capital would be established on the Potomac River; until construction of that capital was completed, Philadelphia would serve as the nation&#x27;s temporary capital. With the backing of all four leaders, the Compromise of 1790, as it became known, was approved by Congress. That same year, Morris and Maclay helped secure Pennsylvania&#x27;s control of the Erie Triangle, which provided the state with access to the Great Lakes.

In the early 1790s, the country became increasingly polarized between the Democratic-Republican Party, led by Jefferson and Madison, and the Federalist Party, led by Hamilton. Though Morris was less focused on politics after the Compromise of 1790, he supported most of Hamilton&#x27;s policies and aligned with the Federalist Party. Morris especially supported Hamilton&#x27;s proposal for the establishment of a national bank. Despite the opposition of Madison and other Southern leaders, Congress approved the establishment of the First Bank of the United States in 1791. While Morris served in Congress, a new political elite emerged in Philadelphia. These new leaders generally respected Morris, but most did not look to him for leadership. With Morris playing little active role, they called a convention that revised the state constitution that included many of the alterations that Morris had long favored, including a bicameral legislature, a state governor with the power to veto bills, and a judiciary with life tenure. Morris also defeated the Pennsylvania &quot;Test Laws&quot; which disenfranchised religious minorities in the state, including Quakers, Anabaptists, and Jewish people.

==Later business career==


Morris refocused on his trading concerns after leaving office as Superintendent of Finance, seeking especially to expand his role in the tobacco trade. He began suffering from financial problems in the late 1780s after a business partner mistakenly refused to honor bills issued by Morris, causing him to default on a loan.
In 1784 Morris was part of a syndicate that backed the sailing of the Empress of China (1783) for the China trade.(In 1787 Morris also sent the ex-warship Alliance to Canton China as part of the China Trade). As part of the effort to repay France for loans that financed the war, Morris contracted to supply 20,000 hogsheads of tobacco annually to France beginning in 1785. Shortly after these contracts were signed, Ambassador Thomas Jefferson took it upon himself to interfere with these arrangements, bringing about the collapse of the tobacco market. Financier James Swan on July 9, 1795, managed to do something Morris had been unable to do: the entire U.S. National debt to France of US$2,024,899 was paid in full. The United States no longer owed money to foreign governments, although it continued to owe money to private investors both in the United States and in Europe. This allowed the young United States to place itself on a sound financial footing.
FromJuly 1778 to January 1780, Morris was agent, normally paid on commission for John Holker (French consul general for the four states of Delaware , Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey . At the same time, he was appointed general agent of the Royal Navy of France and in this capacity had to manage the logistics and finances of the French expeditionary force) . In early 1780, they became partners in William Turnbull and Co. Turnbull had worked for the secret Pennsylvania Committee of Commerce and would manage operations on their behalf.In the monumental edition of the Robert Morris Papers , the list of Holker&#x27;s associates (occasional or regular) is given in a note to volume 7. It is edifying: on the French side, Le Ray de Chaumont of course, Sabatier and Després, La Caze and Mallet, the bankers Le Couteulx and Ferdinand Grand; the authors have just forgotten Holker senior, Antoine Garvey and Baudard de Saint-James , associate in Sabatier&#x27;s business. On the American side, three of the founding fathers , John Langdon , Thomas Fitzsimons and of course Robert Morris, Simeon and Barnabas Deane, brothers of Silas Deane, William Duer, who will be discussed again, Matthew Ridley , Mark Pringle, Jonathan Williams Sr. and Jr 40 , Stacey Hepburn, William Smith (en) , of Baltimore, Benjamin Harrison V , of Virginia 41 . Special mention for Philadelphia merchant Thomas Fitzsimons, one of the very few Catholic signatories of the Constitution , appreciated for his wisdom by both Holker and Morris and who would serve as arbitrator in their disputes.. In fact, Holker&#x27;s French partners fell into a double trap: lured by their yield, they invested part of the transferred funds in Congressional loan certificates that yielded 6% 43 , 44 , without realizing that these state funds would be transformed into junk bonds , and, strengthened by the reassuring words of the authorities, they convinced themselves that the currency would rise, while Morris, for his own account, did the exact opposite: he did not keep any cash and invested it as soon as he had some in goods: he thus avoided losses linked to currency depreciation. The blow of the club is delivered in March 1780 : &quot;Congress officially devalued &quot;old emission&quot; currency at a ratio of forty to one of species, thereby repudiating a significant proportion of the debt it represented 45 &quot;. Holker&#x27;s partners will therefore suffer considerable losses and they will fight for years to obtain compensation, in vain. Chaumont, on the verge of ruin, will have to request a decree preventing its French creditors from seizing its assets. After his resignation, Holker faced two challenges: settling his accounts with Robert Morris and bouncing back to absorb the losses he had suffered. In January 1784 Morris submitted accounts, but the settlement would stumble over the claim for compensation for the depreciation suffered by Holker. Relations between the two partners deteriorated rapidly and Holker wanted to appeal to the courts. This dispute was not anecdotal, because it would lead to a deterioration in Franco-American relations , the French side noting Morris&#x27;s stiffening and becoming increasingly concerned about the repayment of debts contracted by the United States . The interests of a foreign government which was both ally and creditor expanded the dispute from the private realm into the public arena. Holker consulted Thomas Fitzsimons and the latter explained to him that arbitration was preferable. This arbitration would be entrusted to five Philadelphia merchants, including Fitzsimons himself; he would have to wait five years for it. The verdict ofApril 1789exonerate Morris from any liability for the depreciations suffered and finally decide that Holker owes Morris the very symbolic sum of 1500 Pennsylvania pounds. In 1787, Morris was sued in Virginia by Carter Braxton for £28,257; the lawsuit continued for eight years before commissioners were appointed, then Morris appealed. Finally, Virginia&#x27;s Court of Appeals led by Edmund Pendleton decided mostly in favor of Braxton before Morris was forced into bankruptcy by his own continued land speculations (although Morris as late as 1800 believed he should have won £20,000). Morris became increasingly fixated on land speculation, reaching his first major real estate deal in 1790 when he acquired much of the Phelps and Gorham Purchase in western New York. He realized a substantial profit the following year when he sold the land to The Pulteney Association, a group of British land speculators led by Sir William Johnstone Pulteney. Morris used the money from this sale to purchase the remainder of the Phelps and Gorham Purchase, then turned around and sold much of that land to the Holland Land Company, a group of Dutch land speculators. These early successes encouraged Morris to pursue greater profits through increasingly large and risky land acquisitions.

On March 7, 1791, Morris obtained title to a lot from John Dickinson and wife; on March 9, 1793, the site was surveyed; it wasn&#x27;t until 1794 he began construction of a mansion on Chestnut Street in Philadelphia designed by architect of Washington, D.C., Pierre Charles L&#x27;Enfant; it was to occupy an entire block between Chestnut Street and Walnut Street on the western edge of Philadelphia. The structure was of red brick and marble lining. Besides Land Speculation, Morris founded several canal companies: [Similar to the Potomac Company], two Pennsylvania canal companies were set up to try to link the produce of the western lands with the eastern markets; they were the Schuylkill and Susquehanna Navigation Company chartered September 29, 1791, and the Delaware and Schuylkill Canal Company chartered April 10, 1792. Morris was president of both companies; he was also involved with a steam engine company and launched a hot air balloon from his garden on Market Street. He had the first iron rolling mill in America. His icehouse was the model for one Washington installed at Mount Vernon. He backed the new Chestnut Street Theater and had a greenhouse where his staff cultivated lemon trees. In early 1793, Morris purchased shares in a land company led by John Nicholson, the comptroller general of Pennsylvania, beginning a deep business partnership between Nicholson and Morris.

Later in 1793, Morris, Nicholson, and James Greenleaf jointly purchased thousands of lots in the recently established District of Columbia. They subsequently purchased millions of acres in Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Virginia, Georgia, and the Carolinas; in each case, they went into debt to make the purchases, with the intent of quickly reselling the land to realize a profit. Morris and his partners struggled to re-sell their lands, and Greenleaf dropped out from the partnership in 1795. Morris realized a profit by selling his lots in the District of Columbia in 1796, but he and Nicholson still owed their creditors approximately $12 million (about $ in ). By Morris&#x27;s own admission the beginning of his bankruptcy began with the failure of John Warder &amp; Co. of Dublin and Donald and Burton of London in the spring of 1793.

Morris was deeply involved in land speculation, especially after the Revolutionary War; (See Phelps and Gorham Purchase of 1791 above); on April 22, 1794, Morris entered into an association called the Asylum Company with John Nicholson, [who had served as Comptroller-General of the state of Pennsylvania from 1782 to 1794] to purchase 1,000,000 acres of Pennsylvania land besides land they already had title to in Luzerne County; Northumberland County and Northampton County. [This was not the first partnership Morris and Nicholson were involved in; in 1792, Nicholson had negotiated the purchase from the federal government of the tract known as the Erie Triangle. Along with an agent of the Holland Land Company, Aaron Burr, Robert Morris, and other individual and institutional investors, he formed the Pennsylvania Population Company. This front organization purchased all 390 parcels of land in the Erie Triangle. Nicholson was impeached in 1794 for his role in the company. However, Morris severely overextended himself financially. He had borrowed to speculate in real estate in the new national capital, District of Columbia, but signed a contract with a syndicate of Philadelphia investors to take over his obligations there. After that, he took the options to purchase over in the rural south. Unfortunately for Morris, that syndicate reneged on their commitment, leaving him once again liable, but this time with more exposure.

In 1795, Morris and two of his partners, Greenleaf and Nicholson, pooled their land and formed a land company called the North American Land Company. The purpose of this company was to raise money by selling stock secured by the real estate [i.e. to finance their land speculation business]. According to one historian of American land speculation, the NALC was &quot;largest land trust ever known in America&quot;. The three partners turned over to the company land throughout the United States totaling more than , most of it valued at about 50 cents an acre. In addition to land in the District of Columbia, there were in Georgia, in Kentucky, in North Carolina, in Pennsylvania, in South Carolina, and in Virginia. NALC was authorized to issue 30,000 shares, each worth $100. To encourage investors to purchase shares, the three partners guaranteed that a 6 percent dividend would be paid every year. To ensure that there was enough money to pay this divided, each partner agreed to put 3,000 of their own NALC shares in escrow. Greenleaf, Morris, and Nicholson were entitled to receive a 2.5 percent commission on any land the company sold. Greenleaf was named secretary of the new company. Other land speculations that Morris was involved in was the Illinois-Wabash Company and the Georgia Yazoo Land Company

=== 1796 lack of capital and Panic of 1797 and bankruptcy ===
The Washington DC Lots were not the only land problems for Morris; he began losing everything for nonpayment on interest on loans and taxes: In May 1796, John Barker Church accepted a mortgage on another 100,000 acres of the Morris Reserve in present-day Allegany County and Genesee County, against a debt owed to him by Morris. After Morris failed to pay the mortgage, Church foreclosed, and Church&#x27;s son Philip Schuyler Church acquired the land in May 1800. Philip began the settlement of Allegany and Genesee counties by founding the village of Angelica, New York. In a letter of September 1797 to his partner Nicholson, Morris begged to be able to find $500.00 to pay two years wages to his servant Mr. Richard; in a subsequent letter October 25, 1797, to Nicholson, Morris moaned that 200,000 acres of North Carolina land which had cost him $27,000.00 had been sold for one year&#x27;s taxes. In regard to Morris&#x27;s Philadelphia mansion L&#x27;Enfant was paid $9,037.13 between December 1795 and January 1799. Despite the spent amount of £6138 5s 10d it was never completed. The bank of Pennsylvania brought suit against him and a judgement made against him for $20,997.40; an execution against his unfinished Chestnut Street &quot;Morris Folly&quot; mansion was issued in September 1797 to Philadelphia Sherriff Baker; Sherriff Penrose on December 11, 1797, made deed-poll to William Sansom for the building and the lot sold for $25,600 subject to a £7,000 in specie mortgage payable to Messrs Willink of Amsterdam. The last credit for the house was July 2, 1801, and the last charge for it was made July 9, 1801. The unfinished mansion became known as &quot;Morris&#x27;s folly&quot;, and the land eventually became Sansom Street. Marble from this house was purchased by Latrobe; he used it to adorn buildings and monuments from Rhode Island to Charlestown, South Carolina.

The two canal companies had also failed as well: for example, after its incorporation the Schuylkill and Susquehanna was subscribed for 40,000 shares—but only 1000 shares were sold; the Delaware and Schuylkill company was to have been 2000 shares at $200.00 a share. Operations were suspended because &quot;Either on account of errors in plans adopted, failure to procure the necessary means, financial convulsions, or a combination of all these difficulties, they were compelled to suspend their operations after an outlay of $440,000, which was an immense sum in those days&quot;. When England and the Dutch declared war on Revolutionary France, an expected loan from Holland never materialized.

The French Revolution (1789 to 1799) ruined the market for American land and Morris&#x27;s highly leveraged company collapsed. Lastly, the financial markets of England, the United States, and the Caribbean suffered from deflation related with the Panic of 1797. Morris was left &quot;land rich and cash poor&quot;. He &quot;owned&quot; more land than any other American at any time but didn&#x27;t have enough liquid capital to pay his creditors. Among his creditors was his son-in-law James Marshall for £20,000 sterling; likewise, his brother-in-law Bishop White was also a creditor to Morris for $3,000. Gouvenor Morris was owned $24,000 &quot;exclusive of what he paid in Europe on my account, the amount of which I do not know.&quot;; Henry Lee III was a creditor for protested bills for $39,446 plus damages and interest; Morris&#x27;s wife Mary had a sum of credit of $15,860.16 from the sale of two farms left to her by her father;his daughter Esther Morris had a credit of a few hundred pounds left to her by her grandmother received by Morris; as Morris had given her on her marriage nothing but clothes and old wine he assigned to her two quarter chests of tea which he sent to Alexandria, Virginia for sale although he feared this would not amount to principal and interest; his son Robert Morris Jr was a debtor for sums spent in Europe without his father&#x27;s knowledge; his son Charles while under age had contracted bills without his father&#x27;s knowledge for $144.94 for a tailor and $24.50 for a shoemaker. The NALC encountered financial difficulty almost immediately. Only of land was turned over to the NALC, which meant it could issue only 22,365 shares. This meant only 7,455 shares were put into escrow (instead of the required 9,000). Rather than paying creditors with cash, the NALC paid them with shares (8,477 shares in 1795 and 1796). On May 15, 1795, the D.C. commissioners demanded their first payment from Greenleaf, Morris, and Nicholson, for the 6,000 lots purchased in 1793. But Greenleaf had misappropriated some of the company&#x27;s income to pay his own debts. Without the Dutch mortgage income and missing funds, there was no money to make the payment to the commissioners. Furthermore, Greenleaf had co-signed for loans taken out by Morris and Nicholson. When these men defaulted, creditors sought out Greenleaf to make good on the debts—which he could not.

Moris and his partners had failed to both pay the instalments on the Washington D.C. building lots and finished building twenty houses (they had contracted ten houses annually for seven years on said lots); On July 10, 1795, Morris and Nicholson bought out Greenleaf&#x27;s interest in the December 24, 1793, agreement. The commissioners began legal proceedings to regain title to the 6,000 lots owned by NALC and the 1,115.25 lots owned by Greenleaf personally. The worsening financial problems of Greenleaf, Morris, and Nicholson led to increasingly poor personal relations among the three men. Nicholson, particularly bitter, began making public accusations against Greenleaf in print. Morris attempted to mediate between the two men, but his efforts failed. In an attempt to resolve his financial problems, Greenleaf sold his shares in the NALC to Nicholson and Morris on May 28, 1796, for $1.5 million. Unfortunately, Morris and Nicholson funded their purchase by giving Greenleaf personal notes. Furthermore, they endorsed one another&#x27;s notes. Morris and Nicholson, themselves nearly bankrupt, agreed to pay one-quarter of the purchase price every year for the next four years. Greenleaf&#x27;s shares were not to be transferred to Morris and Nicholson until the fourth payment was received. On September 30, 1796, James Greenleaf put 7,455 of his NALC shares in a trust (known as the &quot;391 trust&quot; because it was recorded on page 391 of the firm&#x27;s accounting book). The &quot;391 trust&quot; was created to generate income (from the 6 percent dividend) to pay a loan given to Greenleaf by Edward Fox. A trustee was assigned to hold on to the shares. The same day, Greenleaf put 2,545 shares into another trust (the &quot;381 trust&quot;), as a guarantee against nonpayment of the dividend by Morris and Nicholson. Morris and Nicholson&#x27;s made the first payment to Greenleaf for the one-third interest in the NALC by turning over title to several hundred lots in Washington, D.C. On March 8, 1797, Greenleaf executed the 381 trust.

When the NALC did not issue its 6 percent dividend, Greenleaf transferred one-third of the shares in the &quot;391 trust&quot; to the trustees. The total number of shares transferred to the &quot;381 trust&quot; trustees was now 6,119. On June 24, 1797, Morris, Greenleaf and Nicholson had conveyed their Washington D.C. Lots in trust to Henry Pratt and others in payments of their debts. Poor business practices were now dragging down NALC. For years, Morris and Nicholson had acted as personal guarantors for one another&#x27;s notes. Now many of these notes were coming due, and neither man could pay them. Creditors began selling the notes publicly, often at heavy discounts. By 1798, Morris and Nicholson&#x27;s $10 million (~$ in ) in personal notes were trading at one-eighth their face value. NALC also discovered that some of titles to the of land it owned were not clear, and thus the land could not be used for security. In other cases, NALC found it had been swindled, and the rich land it thought it owned turned out to be barren and worthless. Morris and Nicholson honestly believed that, if their cash flow problems were fixed, they could make payments on the property they owned, and their shares would be returned to them. This proved incorrect. On October 23, 1807, all stock in the company was sold at 7 cents on the dollar to the accountants managing the Aggregate Fund. In 1856, the Trustees of the North American Land Company held $92,071.87 (~$ in ). Morris and Nicholson&#x27;s heirs sued to recover the stock and gain access to the income. The North American Land Company stayed in existence until 1872. An 1880 auditors report called the litigation &quot;phenomenal ... the counsel for Morris and Nickerson pursued the fund for twenty-five years, seeking to obtain it from the trustees of the North American Company and the trusts which had been created from it, and also defending the money from the State in an attempt to sequestrate it. After all counsel fees and expenses, the amount available for division to the Morris interest was $9,692.49.&quot;

In 1797 Morris conveyed his household furniture to Thomas Fitzsimmons which was sold at public auction. What was left was lent to Mrs. Morris by Fitzsimmons and Morris son-in-law Marshall; all Morris had left in his house was some bedding, clothing, part of a quarter cask of wine; part of a barrel of flour, some coffee, a little sugar and some bottled wine which was the remainder from a cask he had given to his daughter Maria. Morris attempted to avoid creditors by staying outside the city at his country estate &quot;The Hills&quot;, located on the Schuylkill River, but his creditors literally pursued him to his gate. Morris was sued by a former partner, James Greenleaf, who had been imprisoned for fraud and was serving time in debtors&#x27; prison. Unable to dodge his creditors and their lawyers, Morris was finally arrested. He was imprisoned for debt in Prune Street prison in Philadelphia from February 1798 to August 1801. Morris property Summerseat (Morrisville, Pennsylvania) would be sold in a Sherriff&#x27;s sale on June 9, 1798, to George Clymer and Thomas Fitzsimmons for $41,000.00. In January 1799 Morris lamented to Nicholson of how a London firm had refused to accept his bill of lading £389 sterling &quot;because the money in the hands of the party upon whom the bill was drawn had been attached by the owner of a bond given for payment of some lands in Georgia&quot;. 43 of the 100 acres of Morris estate &quot;The Hills&quot; was purchased in March 1799 by Henry Pratt for $14,654.00 (~$ in ) for his country house Lemon Hill after the tearing down of Morris&#x27;s old mansion; in turn the &quot;Lemon Hill&quot; estate became part of the foundation for Fairmount Park Philadelphia; one part of Morris property which had also been purchased in 1799 by William Cannard became part of the Sedgeley mansion-which ironically also in turn became part of Fairmont Park. Of his partners Geenleaf was released after being declared bankrupt in 1798; Nicholson died in prison in 1800. Morris wrote that the deceased Nicolson owned him $60,000 specie from all the entries and transactions but &quot;With the purest intentions, he unfortunately he had laid a train that ended as it had done. I here say that he laid the train, because there are living witness that I opposed as soon as I knew it, although from infatuation, maddness or weakness, I gave away afterward.&quot;

==Final years==

Morris was unable to pay his debts, and he remained in debtors&#x27; prison for three and a half years. Morris was released from prison in August 1801 after Congress passed its first bankruptcy legislation, the Bankruptcy Act of 1800 in part to get Morris out of prison. At the time of his release, three commissioners found that he had debts of $2,948,711.11; the proceedings were certified October 15, 1801, after 2/3 of his creditors agreed to the discharge of Morris; on December 4, 1801, a certificate of bankruptcy was confirmed. but he remained financially destitute. Gouverneur Morris, who served as Robert Morris&#x27;s representative to the Holland Land Company, was able to attach a provision to the sale of some land that gave Mary Morris a $1,500 () per year annuity; this annuity allowed Mary to rent a small house in Philadelphia far away from the city&#x27;s center.
One of the few assets Morris had left to him was his father&#x27;s old worn out gold watch which he had inherited at the start of his career; Morris managed to leave this timepiece in his Will to his son Robert Jr. Morris died on May 8, 1806, in Philadelphia. No public ceremonies marked his death. He was buried in the churchyard of Christ Church.

==Legacy==
===Historical reputation===

Biographer Charles Rappleye writes that Morris &quot;was too rich to be a folk hero, and the ultimate failure of his personal fortune robbed him of any Midas-like mystique.&quot; Some historians have largely ignored Morris&#x27;s role in founding the United States, while others regard him as the leader of a conservative, anti-democratic faction of the Founding Fathers. Robert E. Wright and David J. Cowen describe Morris as a &quot;fallen angel&quot; who &quot;almost single-handedly financed the final years&quot; of the American Revolution before falling into &quot;ignominy&quot; for defaulting on his debts. Historian William Hogeland writes &quot;given his seminal performance to victory in the Revolution, as well as to forming the nation, Robert Morris isn&#x27;t as well known by Americans as he ought to be.&quot;

===Memorials===

Morris&#x27;s portrait appeared on US$1,000 greenbacks from 1862 to 1863 and on the $10 silver certificate from 1878 to 1880. Institutions named in honor of Morris include Robert Morris University and the Robert Morris Experiential College at Roosevelt University. Mount Morris, New York, the location of a large flood control dam on the Genesee River, is named in his honor. A number of ships in the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Coast Guard have been named USS &quot;Morris&quot; or USRC &quot;Morris&quot; for him. Morrisville, Pennsylvania, was named in his honor. The Morris-Taney-class cutter was named for Morris and Roger Taney. A statue of Morris stands at Independence National Historical Park, and a monument to Morris, Washington, and Haym Salomon stands at Heald Square in Chicago, Illinois.

Summerseat, Morris&#x27;s former estate in Morrisville, is listed as a National Historic Landmark. Lemon Hill, a Federal-style estate listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is located on a parcel of land formerly owned by Morris. Part of the Liberty Bell Center is on land that was formerly part of the estate known as the President&#x27;s House. Robert Morris holds the curious distinction as the only Founding Father whose house is a national memorial, but his life is not interpreted at the site.

Morris is included in the Washington, D.C., Memorial to the 56 Signers of the Declaration of Independence.

In April 2023, vandals wrote the words &quot;Human Trafficer&quot; on a Morris statue located at Independence National Historical Park (INHP) in Philadelphia. The INHP said the graffiti was written using felt marker, and the aged and weathered marble absorbed the markings. A material conservator used lasers to lighten the markings but was unable to remove them.

<text>Robert H. Morris (July 25, 1932 – June 26, 2011) was an American cryptographer and computer scientist.
==Family and education==
Morris was born in Boston, Massachusetts. His parents were Walter W. Morris, a salesman, and Helen Kelly Morris, a homemaker. He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in mathematics from Harvard University in 1957 and a master&#x27;s degree in applied mathematics from Harvard in 1958.

He married Anne Farlow, and they had three children together: Robert Tappan Morris (author of the 1988 Morris worm), Meredith Morris, and Benjamin Morris.

==Bell Labs==
From 1960 until 1986, Morris was a researcher at Bell Labs and worked on Multics and later Unix.

Together with Douglas McIlroy, he created the M6 macro processor in FORTRAN IV, which was later ported to Unix.

Using the TMG compiler-compiler, Morris, together with McIlroy, developed the early implementation of the PL/I compiler called EPL for the Multics project. The pair also contributed a version of runoff text-formatting program for Multics.

Morris&#x27;s contributions to early versions of Unix include the math library, the dc programming language, the program codice_1, and the password encryption scheme used for user authentication. The encryption scheme (invented by Roger Needham), was based on using a trapdoor function (now called a key derivation function) to compute hashes of user passwords which were stored in the file codice_2; analogous techniques, relying on different functions, are still in use today.

==National Security Agency==
In 1986, Morris began work at the National Security Agency (NSA). He served as chief scientist of the NSA&#x27;s National Computer Security Center, where he was involved in the production of the Rainbow Series of computer security standards, and retired from the NSA in 1994. He once told a reporter that, while at the NSA, he helped the FBI decode encrypted evidence.

There is a description of Morris in Clifford Stoll&#x27;s book &quot;The Cuckoo&#x27;s Egg&quot;.
Many readers of Stoll&#x27;s book remember Morris for giving Stoll a challenging mathematical puzzle (originally due to John H. Conway) in the course of their discussions on computer security: &quot;What is the next number in the sequence 1 11 21 1211 111221?&quot; (known as the look-and-say sequence). Stoll was unaware of the answer to this puzzle at the time and remained unaware when writing &quot;The Cuckoo&#x27;s Egg&quot; and thus did not reveal the answer in his book.

Robert Morris died in Lebanon, New Hampshire.

==Quotes==

* Rule 1 of cryptanalysis: check for plaintext.
* Never underestimate the attention, risk, money, and time that an opponent will put into reading traffic.
* It is easy to run a secure computer system. You merely have to disconnect all dial-up connections and permit only direct-wired terminals, put the machine and its terminals in a shielded room, and post a guard at the door.

<text>Robert Tappan Morris (born November 8, 1965) is an American computer scientist and entrepreneur. He is best known for creating the Morris worm in 1988, considered the first computer worm on the Internet. 

Morris was prosecuted for releasing the worm, and became the first person convicted under the then-new Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA).
He went on to cofound the online store Viaweb, one of the first web applications, and later the venture capital funding firm Y Combinator, both with Paul Graham and Trevor Blackwell.

He later joined the faculty in the department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he received tenure in 2006. He was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2019.

== Early life ==
Morris was born in 1965 to parents Robert Morris and Anne Farlow Morris. The senior Robert Morris was a computer scientist at Bell Labs, who helped design Multics and Unix; and later became the chief scientist at the National Computer Security Center, a division of the National Security Agency (NSA).

Morris grew up in the Millington section of Long Hill Township, New Jersey, attended The Peck School, and graduated from Delbarton School in 1983.

Morris attended Harvard University, and later went on to graduate school at Cornell University. During his first year there, he designed a computer worm (see below) that disrupted many computers on what was then a fledgling internet. This led to him being indicted a year later.

After serving his conviction term, he returned to Harvard to complete his Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) under the supervision of H. T. Kung. He finished in 1999.

== Morris worm ==

Morris&#x27;s computer worm was developed in 1988, while he was a graduate student at Cornell University. He released the worm from MIT, rather than from Cornell. The worm exploited several vulnerabilities to gain entry to targeted systems, including:
* A hole in the debug mode of the Unix &quot;sendmail&quot; program
* A buffer overflow or overrun hole in the &quot;fingerd&quot; network service
* The transitive trust enabled by people setting up network logins with no password requirements via &quot;remote execution&quot; (rexec) with &quot;Remote Shell&quot; (rsh), termed &quot;rexec/rsh&quot;

The worm was programmed to check each computer it found to determine if the infection was already present. However, Morris believed that some system administrators might try to defeat the worm by instructing the computer to report a false positive. To compensate for this possibility, Morris programmed the worm to copy itself anyway, 14% of the time, no matter what the response was to the infection-status interrogation.

This level of persistence was a design flaw: it created system loads that brought it to the attention of administrators, and disrupted the target computers. During the ensuing trial, it was estimated that the cost in &quot;potential loss in productivity&quot; caused by the worm and efforts to remove it from individual system ranged from $200 to $53,000 per system, representing a total economic impact of up to $10,000,000.

=== Criminal prosecution ===
In 1989, Morris was indicted for violating United States Code Title 18 (), the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). He was the first person to be indicted under this act. In December 1990, he was sentenced to three years of probation, 400 hours of community service, and a fine of $10,050 plus the costs of his supervision. He appealed, but his conviction was affirmed the following March. Morris&#x27;s stated motive during the trial was &quot;to demonstrate the inadequacies of current security measures on computer networks by exploiting the security defects [he] had discovered.&quot; He completed his sentence as of 1994.

== Later life and work ==
Morris&#x27;s principal research interest is computer network architectures which includes work on distributed hash tables such as Chord and wireless mesh networks such as Roofnet.

He is a longtime friend and collaborator of Paul Graham. Along with cofounding two companies with him, Graham dedicated his book &quot;ANSI Common Lisp&quot; to Morris and named the programming language that generates the online stores&#x27; web pages RTML (Robert T. Morris Language) in his honor. Graham lists Morris as one of his personal heroes, saying that Morris is &quot;never wrong.&quot;

<text>A keystone species is a species that has a disproportionately large effect on its natural environment relative to its abundance. The concept was introduced in 1969 by the zoologist Robert T. Paine. Keystone species play a critical role in maintaining the structure of an ecological community, affecting many other organisms in an ecosystem and helping to determine the types and numbers of various other species in the community. Without keystone species, the ecosystem would be dramatically different or cease to exist altogether. Some keystone species, such as the wolf and lion, are also apex predators.

The role that a keystone species plays in its ecosystem is analogous to the role of a keystone in an arch. While the keystone is under the least pressure of any of the stones in an arch, the arch still collapses without it. Similarly, an ecosystem may experience a dramatic shift if a keystone species is removed, even though that species was a small part of the ecosystem by measures of biomass or productivity.
It became a popular concept in conservation biology, alongside flagship and umbrella species. Although the concept is valued as a descriptor for particularly strong inter-species interactions, and has allowed easier communication between ecologists and conservation policy-makers, it has been criticized for oversimplifying complex ecological systems.

== History ==

The concept of the keystone species was introduced in 1969 by zoologist Robert T. Paine. Paine developed the concept to explain his observations and experiments on the relationships between marine invertebrates of the intertidal zone (between the high and low tide lines), including starfish and mussels. He removed the starfish from an area, and documented the effects on the ecosystem. In his 1966 paper, &quot;Food Web Complexity and Species Diversity&quot;, Paine had described such a system in Makah Bay in Washington.
In his 1969 paper, Paine proposed the keystone species concept, using &quot;Pisaster ochraceus&quot;, a species of starfish generally known as ochre starfish, and &quot;Mytilus californianus&quot;, a species of mussel, as a primary example. The ochre starfish is a generalist predator and feeds on chitons, limpets, snails, barnacles, echinoids, and even decapod crustacea. The favourite food for these starfish is the mussel which is a dominant competitor for the space on the rocks. The ochre starfish keeps the population numbers of the mussels in check along with the other preys allowing the other seaweeds, sponges, and anemones, that ochre starfish do not consume, to co-exist. When Paine removed the ochre starfish, the mussels quickly outgrew the other species crowding them out. At the start, the rock pools held 15 rock-clinging species. Three years later there were 8 such species; and ten years later the pools were largely occupied by a single species, mussels. The concept became popular in conservation, and was deployed in a range of contexts and mobilized to engender support for conservation, especially where human activities had damaged ecosystems, such as by removing keystone predators.

== Definitions ==

A keystone species was defined by Paine as a species that has a disproportionately large effect on its environment relative to its abundance. It has been defined operationally by Davic in 2003 as &quot;a strongly interacting species whose top-down effect on species diversity and competition is large relative to its biomass dominance within a functional group.&quot;

A classic keystone species is a predator that prevents a particular herbivorous species from eliminating dominant plant species. If prey numbers are low, keystone predators can be even less abundant and still be effective. Yet without the predators, the herbivorous prey would explode in numbers, wipe out the dominant plants, and dramatically alter the character of the ecosystem. The exact scenario changes in each example, but the central idea remains that through a chain of interactions, a non-abundant species has an outsized impact on ecosystem functions. For example, the herbivorous weevil &quot;Euhrychiopsis lecontei&quot; is thought to have keystone effects on aquatic plant diversity by foraging on nuisance Eurasian watermilfoil in North American waters. Similarly, the wasp species &quot;Agelaia vicina&quot; has been labeled a keystone species for its unparalleled nest size, colony size, and high rate of brood production. The diversity of its prey and the quantity necessary to sustain its high rate of growth have a direct impact on other species around it.

The keystone concept is defined by its ecological effects, and these in turn make it important for conservation. In this it overlaps with several other species conservation concepts such as flagship species, indicator species, and umbrella species. For example, the jaguar is a charismatic big cat which meets all of these definitions:

== Predators ==

=== Sea otters and kelp forests ===

Sea otters protect kelp forests from damage by sea urchins. When the sea otters of the North American west coast were hunted commercially for their fur, their numbers fell to such low levels – fewer than 1000 in the north Pacific ocean – that they were unable to control the sea urchin population. The urchins, in turn, grazed the holdfasts of kelp so heavily that the kelp forests largely disappeared, along with all the species that depended on them. Reintroducing the sea otters has enabled the kelp ecosystem to be restored. For example, in Southeast Alaska some 400 sea otters were released, and they have bred to form a population approaching 25,000.

=== The wolf, Yellowstone&#x27;s apex predator ===

Keystone predators may increase the biodiversity of communities by preventing a single species from becoming dominant. They can have a profound influence on the balance of organisms in a particular ecosystem. Introduction or removal of a keystone predator, or changes in its population density, can have drastic cascading effects on the equilibrium of many other populations in the ecosystem. For example, grazers of a grassland may prevent a single dominant species from taking over.

The elimination of the gray wolf from the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem had profound impacts on the trophic pyramid. Without predation, herbivores began to over-graze many woody browse species, affecting the area&#x27;s plant populations. In addition, wolves often kept animals from grazing in riparian areas, which protected beavers from having their food sources encroached upon. The removal of wolves had a direct effect on beaver populations, as their habitat became grazing territory. Increased browsing on willows and conifers along Blacktail Creek due to a lack of predation caused channel incision because the beavers helped slow the water down, allowing soil to stay in place. Furthermore, predation keeps hydrological features such as creeks and streams in normal working order. When wolves were reintroduced, the beaver population and the whole riparian ecosystem recovered dramatically within a few years.

=== Sea stars and other non-apex predators ===

As described by Paine in 1966, some sea stars (e.g., &quot;Pisaster ochraceus&quot;) may prey on sea urchins, mussels, and other shellfish that have no other natural predators. If the sea star is removed from the ecosystem, the mussel population explodes uncontrollably, driving out most other species. 

These creatures need not be apex predators. Sea stars are prey for sharks, rays, and sea anemones. Sea otters are prey for orca.

The jaguar, whose numbers in Central and South America have been classified as near threatened, acts as a keystone predator by its widely varied diet, helping to balance the mammalian jungle ecosystem with its consumption of 87 different species of prey. The lion is another keystone species.

== Mutualists ==

Keystone mutualists are organisms that participate in mutually beneficial interaction, the loss of which would have a profound impact upon the ecosystem as a whole. For example, in the Avon Wheatbelt region of Western Australia, there is a period of each year when &quot;Banksia prionotes&quot; (acorn banksia) is the sole source of nectar for honeyeaters, which play an important role in pollination of numerous plant species. Therefore, the loss of this one species of tree would probably cause the honeyeater population to collapse, with profound implications for the entire ecosystem. Another example is frugivores, such as the cassowary, which spreads the seeds of many different trees. Some seeds will not grow unless they have been through a cassowary.

== Ecosystem engineers ==

A term used alongside keystone is ecosystem engineer. In North America, the prairie dog is an ecosystem engineer. Prairie dog burrows provide the nesting areas for mountain plovers and burrowing owls. Prairie dog tunnel systems also help channel rainwater into the water table to prevent runoff and erosion, and can also serve to change the composition of the soil in a region by increasing aeration and reversing soil compaction that can be a result of cattle grazing. Prairie dogs also trim the vegetation around their colonies, perhaps to remove any cover for predators. Grazing species such as plains bison, which is another keystone species, the pronghorn, and the mule deer have shown a proclivity for grazing on the same land used by prairie dogs.

The beaver is a well known ecosystem engineer and keystone species. It transforms its territory from a stream to a pond or swamp. Beavers affect the environment first altering the edges of riparian areas by cutting down older trees to use for their dams. This allows younger trees to take their place. Beaver dams alter the riparian area they are established in. Depending on topography, soils, and many factors, these dams change the riparian edges of streams and rivers into wetlands, meadows, or riverine forests. These dams have been shown to be beneficial to a myriad of species including amphibians, salmon, and song birds.

In the African savanna, the larger herbivores, especially the elephants, shape their environment. The elephants destroy trees, making room for the grass species and creating habitat for various small animal species. Without these animals, much of the savanna would turn into woodland.
In the Amazon river basin, peccaries produce and maintain wallows that are utilized by a wide variety of species.
Australian studies have found that parrotfish on the Great Barrier Reef are the only reef fish that consistently scrape and clean the coral on the reef. Without these animals, the Great Barrier Reef would be under severe strain.

In the Serengeti, the presence of sufficient gnus in these grasslands reduces wildfire likelihood, which in turn promotes tree growth. The documentary The Serengeti Rules documents this in detail.
== Limitations ==

=== Depends on context ===

The community ecologist Bruce Menge states that the keystone concept has been stretched far beyond Paine&#x27;s original concept. That stretching can be quantified: the researcher Ishana Shukla has listed 230 species identified as keystones in some 157 studies in the 50 years since Paine&#x27;s paper. Menge&#x27;s own work has shown that the purple &quot;Pisaster&quot; sea star that Paine had studied was a powerful keystone species in places exposed to strong wave action, but was far less important in sheltered places. Paine had indeed stated that in Alaska, without the relevant mussel species as prey, the predatory &quot;Pisaster&quot; was &quot;just another sea star&quot;. In other words, the extent to which a species could be described as a keystone depended on the ecological context.

=== Multiple meanings ===

Although the concept of the keystone species has a value in describing particularly strong inter-species interactions, and for allowing easier communication between ecologists and conservation policy-makers, it has been criticized by L. S. Mills and colleagues for oversimplifying complex ecological systems. The term has been applied widely in different ecosystems and to predators, prey, and plants (primary producers), inevitably with differing ecological meanings. For instance, removing a predator may allow other animals to increase to the point where they wipe out other species; removing a prey species may cause predator populations to crash, or may allow predators to drive other prey species to extinction; and removing a plant species may result in the loss of animals that depend on it, like pollinators and seed dispersers. Beavers too have been called keystone, not for eating other species but for modifying the environment in ways that affected other species. The term has thus been given quite different meanings in different cases. In Mills&#x27;s view, Paine&#x27;s work showed that a few species could sometimes have extremely strong interactions within a particular ecosystem, but that does not automatically imply that other ecosystems have a similar structure.

<text>Craven A &quot;(stylized as&quot; Craven &quot;A&quot;&quot;)&quot; is a British brand of cigarettes, currently manufactured by British American Tobacco. Originally founded and produced by the Carreras Tobacco Company in 1921 until merging with Rothmans International in 1972, who then produced the brand until Rothmans was acquired by British American Tobacco in 1999. 

The cigarette brand is named after the third Earl of Craven, after the &quot;Craven Mixture&quot;, a tobacco blend formulated for the 3rd Earl in the 1860s by tobacconist Don José Joaquin Carreras.

==History==
After the end of World War I, the cigarette market resumed its normal competitive spirit with the Carreras Tobacco Company once more well to the fore. Bernhard Baron, a director of Carreras, knew that to compete successfully his product had to be better than his competitors&#x27; and in 1921 Carreras launched &quot;A&quot;, using the name of the 3rd Earl of Craven. Presumably its name did not refer to the normal meaning of the word &#x27;craven&#x27; (cowardly); beyond the historic connection to the &quot;Craven Mixture&quot; tobacco blend, the year of release of the Craven &quot;A&quot; brand coincided with the well-publicised death of the 4th Earl of Craven in a yachting accident on 10 July 1921. It was the first machine-made cork-tipped cigarette, and it became a household name in over 120 countries with the slogan &quot;Will Not Affect Your Throat&quot;. 
Following the success of Craven A, several other companies launched cork-tipped cigarettes which enjoyed varying degrees of success. Few (if any) of these remain available as of 2019.

At the same time as Craven A was pioneering a new fashion in cigarette smoking, the competition was moving in on the coupon business. Carreras participated in this market with their Black Cat brand.

The brand was widely used in World War II not only by British soldiers, but in general. Craven A was one of several brands donated by tobacco manufacturers to soldiers&#x27; rations in the hope of developing ongoing brand loyalty.

Also during the Second World War, General Charles de Gaulle, in exile in London, had difficulties in obtaining his usual French brown cigarettes brand Gitanes. Consequently, he started smoking Craven A and apparently took a liking to the blonde tobacco, which until then had been rare in occupied France.

Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, chain-smoked fifty Craven A cigarettes a day, even while terminally ill with tuberculosis.

==Advertising==

Craven &#x27;A&#x27; started using the slogan &quot;For Your Throat&#x27;s Sake&quot; around 1939. It had a famous slogan, &quot;Will Not Affect Your Throat&quot;.

Many advertising posters were made to promote Craven &#x27;A&#x27; cigarettes.

==Counterfeiting==
In May 2014, Carreras Limited warned that counterfeit Craven A cigarettes were being sold in Jamaica. The counterfeits were said to be non-compliant with Jamaican Public Health labelling regulations.

==Markets==
Craven &#x27;A&#x27; were or still are sold in the following countries: Canada, United States, Jamaica, United Kingdom, Germany, Greece, France, Austria, Italy, Cyprus, Ivory Coast, South Africa, Palestine, Vietnam, Malaysia, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Australia.

==Sponsorship==
The company sponsored the 1981 Craven Mild Cup Rugby League tournament in New South Wales, Australia. Craven &#x27;A&#x27; sponsored events in Canada such as the &quot;Just for Laughs&quot; Canadian Comedy Tour in March 1999. The company was also a long-time sponsor of Australian racing driver Allan Grice.

==In popular culture==
===Novels===
Craven &#x27;A&#x27; cigarettes appeared in the James Bond novel Dr. No. 

Shanghai beggars in J.G Ballard&#x27;s novel &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot; are described as &#x27;shaking their Craven A tins like reformed smokers.&#x27;

Craven &#x27;A&#x27; cigarettes are mentioned in Patricia Highsmith&#x27;s novel &quot;The Price of Salt&quot;, where they are smoked by Carol, one of the main characters. They are not shown in the 2015 film of the novel.

Craven &#x27;A&#x27; cigarettes are also mentioned in the Irish author Benjamin Black&#x27;s mystery book &quot;Even the Dead&quot;, where they are smoked by Lisa Smith, a young lady in distress. Quote from the book:&#x27;She opened her handbag and took out a packet of Craven A and a box of matches.&#x27;

Craven ‘A’ cigarettes were also the cigarettes of choice for the father of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, as mentioned in the book by his younger sister, Fatima Jinnah. 

Craven ‘A’ cigarettes are the subject of a memorandum made by George Orwell to himself, in his published diaries, of detail to incorporate in a potential future novel. The diary entry for 3rd February 1936 recounts a visit to Rudyard Lake in Staffordshire, England, which was part-frozen at the time. The sound being made by the ice as it is rocked by the wind is described by Orwell as “the most melancholy noise I ever heard”. He writes: “[Memorandum] to use in novel some time and to have an empty Craven A packet bobbing up and down among the ice.” 

===Music===
The name of this brand is taken anecdotally in the song &quot;Les Bêtises&quot; by Sabine Paturel and in &quot;Le Chien&quot; by Léo Ferré. 
The name &quot;Craven A&quot; is also included in the song &quot;Tendresse et amitié&quot; by Robert Charlebois and the text is written by Réjean Ducharme.
The brand is also mentioned in the 1982 song &quot;Lost Mi Love&quot; by Yellowman.

===Films===
According to his biographer, the French actor Jean Gabin was a regular smoker of filterless Craven A, which he alternated with Gitanes. In the film Pasha, a package of Craven A is visible on the desk of &quot;Commissioner Louis Joss&quot;, Gabin, as well as in Le cave se rebiffe.

In the 1978 film Death on the Nile, Simon Doyle is asked by Monsieur Poirot if his fiancée, the wealthy heiress Linnet Ridgeway, smokes, to which he responds &quot;Just Craven &#x27;A&#x27;&quot;.

<text>Glock Ges.m.b.H. (doing business as GLOCK) is a light weapons manufacturer headquartered in Deutsch-Wagram, Austria, named after its founder, Gaston Glock. The company makes popular polymer-framed pistols, but also produces field knives, entrenching tools, various horse related products, and apparel.

Glock handguns are used by armed forces and law enforcement organizations worldwide, including most law enforcement agencies in the United States. Glock handguns are popular in some countries for personal protection and practical shooting. The company sponsors a competitive shooting team that travels worldwide. As of 2014, Glock produced over two dozen models of handguns in three sizes and seven calibers.

==Products==

===Handguns===
Glock handguns are common sidearms among law enforcement agencies and military organizations around the world, and are also popular weapons for home defense, and concealed/open carry. They are reputed to be highly reliable, able to function under extreme conditions and available in a wide range of ammunition types (9mm, 10mm, .40 S&amp;W, .45 ACP, .45 GAP, .357 SIG, .380 ACP, and .22 LR). Third-party conversion kits for .400 Corbon, .40 Super, and .50 GI are also available. The simplicity of the Glock design as well as its simple operation contributes to its reliability, as it contains a relatively small number of components (nearly half as many as the typical handgun, each one interchangeable requiring no hand-fitting) making maintenance and repair easier and less costly. In December 2019, Glock introduced their first production-model .22-caliber pistol, the Glock 44.

The polymer frame makes them lighter than typical steel or aluminum-framed handguns, an attractive feature for police officers and citizens who carry firearms for extended periods of time. The trigger is the only operating element; all three safeties are deactivated when the trigger is pulled, and automatically activated when it is released. Glock pistols have no manual safeties like other brands&#x27; external safety, often in the form of a lever or button. The only external controls aside from the trigger are the slide stop lever, the magazine catch, and the slide lock for disassembly. This adds to the simplicity of use and removes a potential source of error while operating the handgun under stress. Most of the steel components in a Glock pistol are treated with a nitriding process called Tenifer, which hardens the surface and makes the pistol resistant to corrosion and wear.

Though the Heckler &amp; Koch VP70 was the first polymer-framed pistol and predated the Glock 17 by 12 years, the popularity of Glock pistols inspired other manufacturers to begin production of similar polymer-framed firearms, including the Walther P99, Smith &amp; Wesson Sigma, HS2000 (Springfield Armory XD), Steyr M, Taurus PT 24/7, Caracal, FN Herstal FNP and Ruger SR9 pistols.

In addition to their semi-automatic handguns, Glock also produces a select-fire pistol, the Glock 18, which has both semi-automatic and fully automatic mode. This model is generally available only to law enforcement or military organizations and the details of its production are obscure. Conversion kits for other Glocks to be fired in fully automatic mode exist, but they are third-party, and they are specifically marked as Title 2 devices by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives – restricting their purchase and possession to ATF 3 licensed dealers in the US.

===Other===
As well as handguns, Glock also produces field knives, entrenching tools, various horse related products, and apparel.

==Subsidiaries==
Glock international subsidiaries are:

* Glock America N.V. (Uruguay)
* Glock, Inc. (United States)
* Glock Middle East FZE (United Arab Emirates)
* Glock do Brasil S.A. (Brazil)

==Embezzlement==
Glock has twice been the target of embezzlement schemes involving high-ranking officers of the company or others closely related to the company. In 1999, Charles Ewert attempted to have Gaston Glock murdered after Glock asked for a meeting regarding an accusation of embezzlement. Ewert was convicted of attempted murder along with an accomplice for his involvement.

In April 2012, Paul Jannuzzo, the former CEO of US subsidiary Glock, Inc., was convicted of racketeering regarding his involvement in an embezzlement scheme against the company.

Investigations in the Ewert embezzlement case exposed questionable financial dealings by Ewert and a complicated ownership structure hidden behind a string of shell companies in favourable tax locations around the world.

<text>Mohammad Ayub Khan (14 May 1907 – 19 April 1974) was a Pakistani military officer and statesman who served as the second president of Pakistan from 27 October 1958 until his resignation on 25 March 1969. He was the first native commander-in-chief of the Pakistan Army, serving from 1951 to 1958. Khan rose to prominence after his 1958 Pakistani military coup which ousted President Iskandar Ali Mirza. Khan&#x27;s presidency ended in 1969 when he resigned amid the 1968–1969 Pakistan protests.

Born in the North-West Frontier Province, Khan was educated from the Aligarh Muslim University and trained at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He fought in the Second World War on the British side against the Imperial Japanese Army. After the Partition of British India in August 1947, he joined the Pakistan Army and was posted in East Bengal. In 1951, he became the first native commander-in-chief, succeeding General Gracey. From 1953 to 1958, he served in the civilian government as Defence and Home Minister and supported President Iskandar Ali Mirza&#x27;s decision to impose martial law against prime minister Feroze Khan&#x27;s administration on 7 October 1958. Two weeks later, Ayub Khan seized presidency in a military coup, the first in the country&#x27;s history.

As president, Khan controversially appointed General Musa Khan to replace him as commander-in-chief, superseding decorated senior officers such as Generals Adam Khan, Sher Ali Khan Pataudi and M.A. Latif Khan. He aligned Pakistan with the United States, and allowed American access to air bases inside Pakistan, most notably the airbase outside of Peshawar, from which spy missions over the Soviet Union were launched. Relations with neighboring China were strengthened but his alignment with the US worsened relations with the Soviet Union in 1962. He launched Operation Gibraltar against India in 1965, leading to an all-out war. It resulted in a stalemate and peace was restored via the Tashkent Declaration. Domestically, Ayub subscribed to the laissez-faire policy of Western-aligned nations at the time. Khan privatised state-owned industries, and liberalised the economy generally. Large inflows of foreign aid and investment led to the fastest-growing economy in South Asia. His tenure was also distinguished by the completion of hydroelectric stations, dams, and reservoirs. Under Ayub, Pakistan&#x27;s space program was established, and the country launched its first uncrewed space-mission by 1962. However, the failure of land reforms and a weak taxation system meant that most of this growth landed in the hands of the elite. In 1965, Khan entered the presidential race as the Convention Muslim League&#x27;s candidate to counter the opposition candidate Fatima Jinnah. Ayub won the elections and was re-elected for a second term. In 1967, disapproval of price hikes of food prompted demonstrations across the country led by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Following protests in East Pakistan, Ayub resigned in March 1969 and appointed General Yahya Khan as his successor. Later, fighting a brief illness, he died in 1974.

Khan remains the country&#x27;s longest-serving president and second-longest serving head of state. His legacy remains mixed; his era is often dubbed the &quot;Decade of Development.&quot; Khan is credited with economic prosperity and industrialisation. He is denounced by critics for beginning the first of the intelligence agencies&#x27; incursions into national politics, for concentrating wealth in a corrupt few hands, and for geographically discriminatory policies that later led to the Bangladesh Liberation War.
== Early life and education ==
Ayub Khan was born on 14 May 1907 in Rehana, a village in the Abbottabad District of the North-West Frontier Province of British India into a Hindko-speaking Hazarewal family of Pashtun descent, belonging to the Tareen tribe.

He was the first child of the second wife of Mir Dad Khan, a Risaldar-Major (an armoured corps JCO which was then known as VCO) in the 9th Hodson&#x27;s Horse which was a cavalry regiment of the British Indian Army. For his basic education, he was enrolled in a school in Sarai Saleh, which was about 4 miles from his village. He used to go to school on a mule&#x27;s back and was shifted to a school in Haripur, where he started living with his grandmother.

He went on to study at Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) and while pursuing his college education, he was accepted into the Royal Military College, Sandhurst on the recommendation of General Andrew Skeen; he trained first in India and then departed for Great Britain. Ayub Khan was fluent in Urdu, Pashto, English, and his regional Hindko dialect.

== Military service ==
=== British India ===
Ayub Khan was admitted to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, in 1926. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant on 2 February 1928 in the 19th Punjabis of the 14th Punjab Regiment (better known as 1/14th Punjab Regiment) of the British Indian Army – before this he was attached to the Royal Fusiliers. Amongst those who passed out with him was Joyanto Nath Chaudhuri, who served as Chief of the Army Staff of India from 1962 to 1966 while Ayub was the president of Pakistan. After the standard probationary period of service in the British Army, he was appointed to the British Indian Army on 10 April 1929, joining the 1/14th Punjab Regiment &quot;Sherdils&quot;, now known as the 5th Punjab Regiment.

He was promoted to lieutenant on 2 May 1930 and to captain on 2 February 1937. During World War II, he was promoted to the temporary rank of lieutenant-colonel in 1942 and was posted in Burma to participate in the first phase of the Burma Campaign in 1942–43. He was promoted to the permanent rank of major on 2 February 1945. Later that year, he was promoted to temporary colonel and assumed the command of his own regiment in which he was commissioned to direct operations in the second phase of the Burma Campaign; however, he was soon temporarily suspended without pay from that command for visible cowardice under fire.

In 1946, he was posted back to British India and was stationed in the North-West Frontier Province. In 1947, he was promoted to brigadier and commanded a brigade in South Waziristan.

=== Early career in Pakistan ===

When the United Kingdom announced the Partition of British India into India and Pakistan, he was one of the most senior serving officers in the British Indian Army who opted for Pakistan in 1947. At the time of his joining, he was the tenth ranking officer in terms of seniority with service number PA-010.

In the early part of 1948, he was given the command of the 14th Infantry Division in the rank of acting major-general stationed in Dacca, East Pakistan. In 1949, he was decorated with the Hilal-i-Jurat (HJ) by Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan for non-combatant service and called back to General Headquarters as the Adjutant General of the army on November of the same year.

=== Commander-in-chief of the Pakistan Army ===

As the tenure of General Gracey was nearing its end at the close of 1949, the Pakistan government had called for appointing native commanders-in-chief of the army, air force, and navy and dismissed deputation appointments from the British military. The General Headquarters sent the nomination papers to the Prime Minister&#x27;s Secretariat for the appointment of commander-in-chief. There were four major generals in the race: Akbar Khan, Iftikhar Khan, Ishfakul Majid, and Nawabzada Agha Mohammad Raza. Among these officers Akbar was the senior, having been commissioned in 1920.

That year, General Gracey approached Akbar Khan to succeed him. However, Akbar declined, citing that the position was beyond his competence. The next candidate in line was Akbar&#x27;s younger brother, General Iftikhar Khan. However, Iftikhar died in an air crash in December 1949 before he could take office, resulting in Gracey&#x27;s extension. On 23 January 1951, General Ayub Khan succeeded him.

Defence Secretary Iskandar Mirza at that time played a crucial role in lobbying for the army post selection, by presenting convincing arguments to Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan to promote the most junior major-general, Ayub Khan (commissioned in 1928), to the post despite the fact that his name was not included in the nomination list. Ayub&#x27;s papers of promotion were approved and he was appointed the first native commander-in-chief of the Pakistan Army on 17 January 1951 by Prime Minister Ali Khan. This ended the transitional role of British military officers. Although the Pakistani government announced the appointment of the navy&#x27;s native commander in chief in 1951, it was Ayub Khan who helped Vice-Admiral HMS Choudri to be appointed as the first native navy commander in chief, also in 1953. The events surrounding Ayub&#x27;s appointment set the precedent for a native general being promoted out of turn, ostensibly because he was the least ambitious of the generals in the line of promotion and the most loyal to civil government at that time.

In 1953, Ayub visited Turkey, his first foreign visit as an army commander in chief, and was said to have been impressed with Turkish military tradition; he met only with the Turkish defence minister during his visit. Thereafter, he went to the United States and visited the US State Department and Pentagon to lobby for forging military relations. He termed this visit as a &quot;medical visit&quot; but made a strong plea for military aid which was not considered due to India&#x27;s opposition.

=== Cabinet and Defence Minister ===
On 24 February 1954, Ayub signed the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO) pact for Pakistan and his role in national politics, along with that of Defense Minister Mirza, began to grow

In 1954, Prime Minister Muhammad Ali Bogra&#x27;s relations with the military and Governor-General Ghulam Muhammad deteriorated on issues of the economy. Pressure built up to reconstruct the cabinet which eventually witnessed General Ayub Khan becoming the defence minister and Iskander Mirza as home minister in October 1954. Ayub Khan disdained civilian politicians, whose factional infighting had for years prevented adoption of a constitution. He wrote that he reluctantly joined the cabinet as defence minister with &quot;two clear objectives: to save the armed forces from the interference of the politicians, and to unify the provinces of West Pakistan into one unit.&quot;

The controversial One Unit Scheme integrated the four western provinces into one political entity, West Pakistan, as a counterbalance against the numerically superior population of East Bengal, which was renamed East Pakistan. The province of Punjab supported the project, but all the other provinces protested against it and its centralisation of power. Opposition was particularly strong in East Bengal, where it was seen as an attack on the democratic principle of political egalitarianism.

In 1955, Prime Minister Bogra was dismissed by Governor-General Malik Ghulam Muhammad and he was succeeded by the new Prime Minister Chaudhry Muhammad Ali as the Defence Minister.

After the 1954 provincial elections in East Pakistan, the Awami League formed the government there while West Pakistan was governed by the PML, but the PML government collapsed in 1956. He was called on to join the Cabinet as Defence Minister by Prime Minister H.S. Suhrawardy and maintained closer relations with Iskander Mirza who now had become the first President of the country after the successful promulgation of the Constitution in 1956. In 1957, President Mirza promoted him from acting full general to the substantive rank of full general.

Around this time, the MoD, led by General Ayub Khan, began to see the serious interservice rivalry between the General Headquarters staff and the Naval Headquarters staff. Commander in Chief of Navy Vice-Admiral HMS Choudri and his NHQ staff had been fighting with the Finance ministry and the MoD over the issues of rearmament and contingency plans.

He reportedly complained about Admiral HMS Choudri to President Mirza and criticized Admiral Choudri for &quot;neither having the brain, imagination, or depth of thought to understand such (defence) problems nor the vision or the ability to make any contribution.&quot; The impasse was broken with Admiral Choudri resigning from the navy in protest as a result of having differences with the navy&#x27;s plans of expansion and modernization.

== Presidency (1958–1969) ==

=== 1958 military coup ===

Suhrawardy and Feroz began campaigning to become prime minister and president in the upcoming general elections. Meanwhile, the conservative Pakistan Muslim League, led by its President Abdul Qayyum Khan, was threatening to engage in civil disobedience. These events were against President Mirza hence he was willing to dissolve even Pakistan&#x27;s One Unit for his advantage.

On 7 October 1958, President Iskandar Ali Mirza abrogated the Constitution of Pakistan of 1956 after sending a letter to Prime Minister Feroz announcing a coup d&#x27;état and appointed General Ayub Khan as Chief Martial Law Administrator.

On 13 October, General Ayub Khan assigned Lt. General Wajid Ali Khan Burki the task of improving the efficiency of hospitals and health agencies. Within days, Karachi hospitals showed significant improvement, and the medical services took on a new outlook.

Two weeks later, on 27 October 1958, Ayub Khan carried out his own coup d&#x27;état against Mirza. Most of the country&#x27;s politicians only became aware of the coup the next morning; only U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan James M. Langley was kept fully informed of political developments in the country.

Ayub justified his part by declaring that: &quot;History would never have forgiven us if the present chaotic conditions were allowed to go on any further,&quot; and that his goal was to restore a democracy that the &quot;people can understand and work&quot;, not to rule indefinitely. When the public &quot;was&quot; informed, public reactions were mixed. The immediate crackdown on smuggling, corruption, and trafficking won Ayub plenty of support from the commoners. The middle-class and the upper-middle class were more apprehensive.

President Mirza himself was apprehensive, though for a different reason. He had been contemplating replacing Ayub Khan, and it seems that Ayub knew. Immediately after the Supreme Court&#x27;s Chief Justice Munir justified the coup under the doctrine of necessity, Ayub sent the military into the presidential palace and exiled Mirza to England. This was largely done with the support of: Admiral A. R. Khan, General Azam Khan, Nawab of Kalabagh Amir Khan, General Dr. Wajid Khan, General K. M. Sheikh, and General Sher Bahadur. Air Vice Marshal Asghar Khan was asked by General Ayub Khan to join the Generals to demand Mirza&#x27;s resignation, but Asghar Khan declined the request, stating that he &quot;found the whole exercise distasteful.&quot;

The regime came to power with the intent of instituting widespread reform and &#x27;to bring the country back to sanity&#x27;. Like Mirza, Ayub advocated for greater centralization of power, and his ruling style was more American than British. He &quot;vowed to give people access to speedier justice, curb the crippling birth rate, and take appropriate steps, including land reforms and technological innovation, to develop agriculture so that the country could feed itself.&quot;

Ayub finally &quot;restored civil administration&quot;, although he maintained the Presidency and relied on an intricate web of spy agencies to maintain supremacy over the bureaucracy, including calling upon civilian intelligence agencies.

In 1960, a referendum, that functioned as the Electoral College, was held that asked the general public: &quot;Do you have confidence in Muhammad Ayub Khan?&quot; The voter turnout was recorded at 95.6% and such confirmation was used as impetus to formalise the new system – a presidential system. Ayub Khan was elected president for the next five years and decided to pay his first state visit to the United States with his wife and also daughter Begum Naseem Aurangzeb in July 1961. Highlights of his visit included a state dinner at Mount Vernon, a visit to the Islamic Center of Washington, and a ticker tape parade in New York City.

=== Constitutional and legal reforms ===

A constitutional commission was set-up under the Supreme Court to implement the work on the constitution that was led by Chief Justice Muhammad Shahabuddin and Supreme Court justices. The commission reported in 1961 with its recommendations but President Ayub remained unsatisfied; he eventually altered the constitution so that it was entirely different from the one recommended by the Shahabuddin Commission. The constitution reflected his personal views of politicians and the restriction of using religions in politics. His presidency restored the writ of government through the promulgated constitution and restored political freedom by lifting the martial law enforced since 1958.

The new constitution respected Islam, but did not declare Islam as the state religion and was viewed as a liberal constitution. It also provided for election of the president by 80,000 (later raised to 120,000) Basic Democrats who could theoretically make their own choice but who were essentially under his control. He justified this as analogous to the American Electoral College and cited Thomas Jefferson as his inspiration. The Ayub administration &quot;guided&quot; the print newspapers through his takeover of key opposition papers and, while Ayub Khan permitted a National Assembly, it had only limited powers.

In 1961, he promulgated the &quot;Muslim Family Law Ordinance.&quot; Through this ordinance, unmitigated polygamy was abolished. Consent of the current wife was made mandatory for a second marriage, and brakes were placed on the practice of instant divorce under Islamic tradition, where men could divorce women by saying: &quot;I divorce you&quot; three times.

The Arbitration Councils were set up under the law in the urban and rural areas to deal with cases of: (a) grant of sanction to a person to contract a second marriage during the subsistence of a marriage; (b) reconciliation of a dispute between a husband and a wife; (c) grant of a maintenance allowance to the wife and children.

=== Economy, infrastructure, and public service ===
Industrialization and rural development through constructing modern national freeways are considered his greatest achievements and his era is remembered for successful industrialization in the impoverished country. Strong emphasis on capitalism and foreign direct investment (FDI) in the industry is often regarded as the &quot;Great Decade&quot; in the history of the country (both economical and political history). 

The &quot;Decade of Development&quot; was celebrated, which highlighted the development plans executed during the years of Ayub&#x27;s rule, the private consortium companies and industries, and is credited with creating an environment where the private sector was encouraged to establish medium and small-scale industries in Pakistan. This opened up avenues for new job opportunities and thus the economic graph of the country started rising. He oversaw the development and completion of mega projects such as hydroelectric dams, power stations, and barrages all over the country. During 1960–66, the annual GDP growth was recorded at 6.8%.

Several hydroelectric projects were completed, including the Mangla Dam (one of the world&#x27;s largest dams), several small dams and water reservoirs in West Pakistan, and one dam in East Pakistan, the Kaptai Dam. President Ayub authorized planning of nuclear power plants. Dr. Abdus Salam, supported by the President, personally approved the project in Karachi while the project in East Pakistan never materialized.

Extensive education reforms were supposedly carried out and &#x27;scientific development efforts&#x27; were also supposedly made during his years. These policies could not be sustained after 1965, when the economy collapsed and led to economic declines which he was unable to control.

Ayub introduced new curricula and textbooks for universities and schools. Many public-sector universities and schools were built during his era. He also introduced agricultural reforms preventing anyone from occupying more than 500 acres of irrigated and 1000 acres of unirrigated land. His administration, redistributed approximately 23 percent of the country&#x27;s farmland to onetime tenant farmers. In Karachi, around 100,000 refugees displaced by the partition of India were moved from slums to new housing colonies. His administration also eliminated the need for bribes, known as &quot;tea money&quot; in Pakistan, to access government officials, contributing to a reduction in corruption within Pakistan&#x27;s government relative to other Asian nations during his tenure.

An oil refinery was established in Karachi. These reforms led to 15% GNP growth of the country that was three times greater than that of India. Despite the increase in the GNP growth, the profit and revenue was gained by the famous 22 families of the time that controlled 66% of the industries and land of the country and 80% of the banking and insurance companies of Pakistan.

=== Defence spending ===
During the Ayub era, the navy was able to introduce submarines and slowly modified itself by acquiring warships. However, Ayub drastically reduced funding of the military in the 1950s and de-prioritized nuclear weapons in the 1960s. The military relied on donations from the United States for major weapons procurements. Major funding was made available for military acquisitions and procurement towards conventional weaponry for conventional defence. In the 1960s, the Pakistani military acquired Americanproduced conventional weapons such as Jeep CJs, M48 Patton and M24 Chaffee tanks, M16 rifles, F-86 fighter airplanes, and the submarine PNS Ghazi; all through the US Foreign Military Sales program. In 1961, President Ayub started the nation&#x27;s fullfledged space program in cooperation with the air force, and created the Suparco civilian space agency that launched sounding rockets throughout the 1960s.

Ayub prioritized nuclear power generation over the use of nuclear technology for military purposes. He reportedly spent ₨. 724 million on the civilian Karachi Nuclear Power Plant and related education of engineers and scientists.

Ayub Khan filled more and more civil administrative positions with army officers, increasing the military&#x27;s influence over the bureaucracy. He expanded the size of the army by more than half from the early 1960s to 1969, and maintained a high level of military spending as a percentage of GDP during that period, peaking in the immediate aftermath of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965.

=== Foreign policy ===

==== U.S. alliance and 1960 U-2 incident ====

The main feature of Ayub Khan&#x27;s foreign policy was prioritized relations with the United States and Europe. Foreign relations with the Soviet Union were downplayed. He enjoyed support from President Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s and, working with Prime Minister Ali Khan, forged a military alliance with the United States against regional communism. His obsession towards modernization of the armed forces in the shortest time possible saw relations with the United States as the only way to achieve his organizational and personal objectives as he argued against civilian supremacy that would affect American interests in the region as a result of an election.

The Central Intelligence Agency leased Peshawar Air Station in the 1950s and spying into the Soviet Union from the air station grew immensely, with Ayub&#x27;s full knowledge, during his presidency. When these activities were exposed in 1960 after a U-2 flying out of the air station was shot down and its pilot captured by the USSR, President Ayub was in the United Kingdom on a state visit. When the local CIA station chief briefed President Ayub on the incident, Ayub shrugged his shoulders and said that he had expected this would happen at some point.

Soviet Secretary General Nikita Khrushchev threatened to bomb Peshawar if the United States continued to operate aircraft from there against the Soviet Union. Ayub Khan apologised for the incident when he visited the Soviet Union five years later.
President Ayub directed his Foreign Office to reduce tensions with the Soviet Union by facilitating state visits by Soviet Premier Kosygin and Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko and agreeing to downplay relations with the United States.

In 1963, Ayub signed the historic Sino-Pakistan Frontier Agreement with China despite US opposition.

During 1961–65, Ayub lost much of his support from President John Kennedy and President Lyndon Johnson as they sought closer relations with India. President Johnson placed an embargo on both nations during the war in 1965. Relations with the Soviet Union were eventually normalized when the Soviets facilitated a peace treaty between Pakistan and India in 1965, and reached a trade treaty with Pakistan the following year. In 1966–67, Ayub wrestled with the United States&#x27; attempt to dictate Pakistan&#x27;s foreign policy, while he strengthened relations with the Soviet Union and China. Despite initiatives to normalize relations with the Soviet Union, Ayub Khan remained inclined towards the United States and the western world, receiving President Johnson in Karachi in 1967.

In 1961–62, Ayub paid a state visit to the United Kingdom. He attracted much attention from the British public when his involvement in the Christine Keeler affair was revealed.

==== India: 1959 joint defence and 1965 war ====

In 1959, Ayub Khan&#x27;s interest in building defence forces had already diminished when he made an offer of joint defense with India during the Sino-Indo clashes in October 1959 in Ladakh, in a move seen as a result of American pressure and a lack of understanding of foreign affairs Upon hearing this proposal, India&#x27;s Prime Minister Nehru reportedly countered, &quot;Defence Minister Ayub: Joint Defence on what?&quot; India remained uninterested in such proposals and Prime Minister Nehru decided to push his country&#x27;s role in the Non-Aligned Movement. In 1960, President Ayub, together with Prime Minister Nehru, signed the Indus Waters Treaty brokered by the World Bank. In 1962, after India was defeated by China, Ayub Khan disguised a few thousand soldiers as guerillas and sent them to Indian Kashmir to incite the people to rebel. In 1964, the Pakistan Army engaged with the Indian Army in several skirmishes, and clandestine operations began.

The war with India in 1965 was a turning point in his presidency, and it ended in a settlement reached by Ayub Khan at Tashkent, called the Tashkent Declaration, which was facilitated by the Soviet Union. The settlement was perceived negatively by many Pakistanis and led Foreign Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto to resign his post and take up opposition to Ayub Khan. According to Morrice James, &quot;For them (Pakistanis) Ayub had betrayed the nation and had inexcusably lost face before the Indians.&quot;

According to Sartaj Aziz, deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, it was Foreign Minister Bhutto who had inadvertently set Pakistan on the road to war with India. During a cabinet meeting, Bhutto had gone on a populist anti-Indian and anti-American binge and succeeded in spellbinding President Ayub into thinking he was becoming a world statesman fawned upon by the enemies of the United States. When Ayub authorized Operation Gibraltar, the fomenting of a Kashmiri insurgency against India, Aziz famously told the President: &quot;Sir, I hope you realize that our foreign policy and our economic requirements are not fully consistent, in fact they are rapidly falling out of line.&quot; Aziz opposed Operation Gibraltar, fearing the economical turmoil that would jolt the country&#x27;s economy, but was in turn opposed by his own senior bureaucrats. In that meeting, Foreign Minister Bhutto convinced the president and the finance minister Muhammad Shoaib that India would not attack Pakistan due to Kashmir being a disputed territory, and per Bhutto&#x27;s remarks: &quot;Pakistan&#x27;s incursion into Indian-occupied Kashmir, at [A]khnoor, would not provide [India] with the justification for attacking Pakistan across the international boundary because Kashmir was a disputed territory.&quot; This theory proved wrong, when India launched a full-scale war against West Pakistan in 1965.

Chief of the Army Staff General Musa Khan held off launching Operation Grand Slam, waiting for President Ayub Khan&#x27;s go ahead. The operation didn&#x27;t get underway until after the Indian Army had captured Haji Pir pass in Kashmir. He faced serious altercations with, and public criticism from, air chief Air Marshal Asghar Khan for hiding the details of the war. The Air Headquarters began fighting the president over the contingency plans, and this inter-services rivalry ended with Asghar Khan&#x27;s resignation.

About the 1965 war&#x27;s contingency plans, Air Marshal Nur Khan briefly wrote that &quot;Rumours about an impending operation were rife but the army had not shared the plans with other forces.&quot;

Ayub Khan&#x27;s main sponsor, the United States, did not welcome the move and the Johnson administration placed an economic embargo that caused Pakistan to lose US$500 million in aid and grants that had been received through consortium. Ayub Khan could not politically survive in the aftermath of the 1965 war with India and fell from the presidency after surrendering presidential power to Army Commander General Yahya in 1969.

Afghanistan: Afghanistan-Pakistan Confederation Plan

In the 1950s, partly due to the complicated bilateral relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan over the Durand Line dispute, Ayub Khan along with the Royal family of Afghanistan under King Zahir Shah proposed the Afghanistan-Pakistan Confederation Plan to merge Afghanistan with Pakistan under a single confederation. This merger was proposed on the basis of mutual distrust and fears of security threats by the Indian government and the Soviets, which wasn&#x27;t able to amount to fruition due to the eventual Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the formation of a new communist Afghan regime.

=== 1965 presidential election ===

In 1964, President Ayub Khan was confident in his apparent popularity and saw the deep divisions within the political opposition which ultimately led him to announce presidential elections in 1965. He earned the nomination of the Pakistan Muslim League (PML) and was shocked when Fatima Jinnah was nominated by the Combined Opposition Parties.

Ayub Khan&#x27;s son, Gohar Ayub Khan, launched attacks on Fatima Jinnah supporters. During this time, Ayub Khan used the Pakistani intelligence community for his own advantage. Military Intelligence actively monitored politicians and political gatherings and the Intelligence Bureau taped politicians&#x27; telephone conversations. This was the first departure of the intelligence community from national defence and security to direct interference with national politics, an interference which continued in succeeding years.

It was reported that the elections were widely rigged by the state authorities and machinery under the control of Ayub Khan and it is believed that had the elections been held via direct ballot, Fatima Jinnah would have won. The Electoral College consisted of only 80,000 Basic Democrats. They were easily manipulated by President Ayub Khan, who won the bitterly contested elections with 64% of the Electoral College vote. According to journalists of the time, the election did not conform to international standards; many viewed the election results with great suspicion.

=== 1969 protests and resignation ===
The controversial victory over Fatima Jinnah in the 1965 presidential election and the outcome of the war with India in the same year brought devastating results for Ayub Khan&#x27;s image and his presidency. Khan&#x27;s foreign minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto believed the Tashkent Declaration was a &quot;political surrender&quot; which turned a military victory into defeat. Bhutto began criticizing Ayub Khan openly and resigned in June 1966. In Karachi, public resentment towards Ayub had been rising since the 1965 elections and his policies were widely disapproved.

In 1967, Bhutto formed the Pakistan People&#x27;s Party (PPP) and embarked on a nationwide tour where he attacked the Ayub administration&#x27;s economic, religious, and social policies. Bhutto was arrested for these activities. His detention further inflamed the opposition, and demonstrations were sparked all over the country. The East Pakistani Awami League charged the Ayub administration with discriminatory policies towards the East. Labour unions called for strikes against Ayub Khan&#x27;s administration, and dissatisfaction was widespread in the country&#x27;s middle class by the end of 1968. When Ayub Khan was confronted with the Six point movement led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and with the criticism by Bhutto&#x27;s PPP, he responded by imprisoning both leaders but that made matters worse for Ayub&#x27;s administration.

In 1968, he survived an assassination attempt while visiting Dacca and was visibly shaken afterwards, according to close aides; though this was not reported in the press of the day.

In 1969, Ayub Khan opened negotiations with the opposition parties in what was termed as a &quot;Round Table Conference&quot; where he held talks with all major opposition parties. However, these discussions yielded no results and strong anti-Ayub demonstrations calling for his resignation were sparked all over the country. During this time, Ayub Khan survived a near-fatal cardiac arrest that put him out of the office, and later survived a paralysis attack that put him in a wheelchair. The police were unable to maintain Law and order in Pakistan, especially in East Pakistan where riots and a serious uprising were quelled. At one point, Home and Defence Minister Vice-Admiral Rahman told journalists that the &quot;country was under the mob rule and that police were not strong enough to tackle the situation.&quot;

The PPP also led very strong protests, street demonstrations, and riots against the Ayub Khan&#x27;s administration when the prices of food consumer products such as sugar, tea, and wheat, hiked up. Disapproval of Ayub Khan was widely expressed by chanted slogans and insults referring to him. On the streets of major cities of West Pakistan, massive wall chalkings that employed derogatory and pejorative terms for Ayub made headlines in the print and broadcast media.

Elements in the military began supporting the opposition political parties; it was this that finally brought about the demise of Ayub Khan&#x27;s era. On 25 March 1969, President Ayub Khan, after consulting Advocate Raja Muhammad Qalib Ali Khan (the last person to meet the president before resignation) resigned from office and invited commander-in-chief of the army General Yahya Khan to take over control of the country.

Asghar Khan and Khyber Khan were considered among the likely successors to President Ayub Khan during the collapse of his regime. Khyber was described as &quot;a young, energetic, and popular air force officer in his early forties - who happens to look very much like a younger Ayub Khan.&quot;

== Death and legacy ==
=== Last years ===
Ayub Khan did not comment on the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. He died of a heart attack on 19 April 1974 at his villa near Islamabad at age 66.

=== Foreign policy ===
Ayub Khan&#x27;s presidency allied Pakistan with the American-led military alliance against the Soviet Union which helped Pakistan develop its strong economic background and its long-term political and strategic relations with the United States. Major economic aid and trade from the United States and European Communities ultimately led Pakistan&#x27;s industrial sector to develop rapidly but the consequences of cartelization included increased inequality in the distribution of wealth. After 1965, he became extremely concerned about the arrogance and bossiness of the US over the direction of Pakistan&#x27;s foreign policy when the US publicly criticized Pakistan for building ties with China and the Soviet Union; he authored a book over this issue known as &quot;Friends not Masters&quot;.

=== Diary ===
Ayub Khan began his diary in September 1966, and ended his recordings in October 1972 due to his failing health. The diary covers events such as his resignation from office, the assumption of power by Yahya Khan, the independence of Bangladesh, and the replacement of Yahya by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. After his death in 1972, the diary was not released to the public for thirty years due to opinions which would have been detrimental to the reputation of powerful individuals at the time. Ayub Khan wanted his diary to be edited by his close associate Altaf Gauhar, but after Ayub Khan&#x27;s death the six-year-long diary was entrusted to Oxford University Press (OUP) to edit and publish. At OUP, &quot;Diaries of Field Marshal Mohammad Ayub Khan, 1966–1972&quot; was edited and annotated by American historian Craig Baxter.

=== Development projects ===
The federal capital was relocated under the Ayub administration from the port city of Karachi to the new and carefully planned city of Islamabad in the mountains in 1965. Facilitated by the World Bank, the Ayub administration became a party to the Indus Waters Treaty with archrival India to resolve disputes regarding the sharing of the waters of the six rivers in the Punjab Doab that flow between the two countries. Khan&#x27;s administration also built a major network of irrigation canals, high-water dams, and thermal and hydroelectric power stations.

=== Modernization of agriculture and industrialization ===
He subsidized fertilizers and modernized agriculture through irrigation development and spurred industrial growth with liberal tax benefits. In the decade of his rule, the GNP rose by 45% and manufactured goods began to overtake such traditional exports as jute and cotton. However, the economists in the Planning Commission alleged that his policies were tailored to reward the elite families and major landowners in the country. In 1968, his administration celebrated the so-called &quot;Decade of Development&quot; when the mass protests erupted all over the country due to an increasingly greater divide between the rich and the poor.

=== Global policy ===
He was one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution. As a result, for the first time in human history, a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt a Constitution for the Federation of Earth.

== Criticisms ==
=== Despotism, nepotism and corruption ===
After 1965, the corruption in government, nepotism, and suppression of free speech, thought, and press increased unrest and turmoil in the country against the Ayub administration. The 1965 presidential election, where Ayub Khan was opposed by Fatima Jinnah, was allegedly rigged. In 2003, the nephew of the Quaid-i-Azam, Akbar Pirbhai, re-ignited the controversy by suggesting that Fatima Jinnah&#x27;s death in 1967 was an assassination by the Ayub Khan establishment. Gohar Ayub Khan became the subject of criticism by many writers when he was accused of leading a victory parade after the 1965 election right into the heartland of opposition territory in Karachi in a blatantly provocative move. The civil administration&#x27;s failure to stop the rally led to fierce clashes between opposing groups with many locals being killed. He was faced with allegations of widespread intentional vote riggings, organizing political murders in Karachi. His peace with India was considered by many Pakistanis an embarrassing compromise.

Gohar Ayub Khan also faced criticisms during that time on questions of family corruption and cronyism through his business links with his father-in-law, retired Lieutenant General Habibullah Khan Khattak. One Western commentator in 1969 estimated Gohar Ayub&#x27;s personal wealth at the time at $4 million, while his family&#x27;s wealth was put in the range of $10–20 million. Public criticism of Gohar&#x27;s personal wealth and that of the President increased. All these criticisms harmed President Ayub Khan&#x27;s image.

=== Mishandling of East Pakistan ===
He is also blamed for not doing enough to tackle the significant economic disparity between East and West Pakistan. Whilst he was aware of the acute grievances of East Pakistan, he did try to address the situation. However, the Ayub Khan regime was so highly centralized that, in the absence of democratic institutions, densely populated and politicized East Pakistan province continued to feel it was being slighted.

During his presidency, differences between West and East Pakistan arose to an enormous degree, that ultimately led to the independence of Bangladesh following the Bangladesh Liberation War.

=== Islamization ===
Historian Yasmin Saikia argues that the Islamization that is often blamed on Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq has its roots in the policies of Ayub Khan, who injected a &quot;jihadi&quot; rhetoric into the Pakistan Army, his re-writing of Pakistan&#x27;s history from a purely Islamic viewpoint and his categorization of Bengali Muslims as being too influenced by Hinduism.

=== Weakening of constitutional government ===
On 13 May 2024, Minister of Defence Khawaja Asif delivered a speech on the floor of the National Assembly of Pakistan in which he stated that Ayub was the first dictator who violated the Constitution of Pakistan and overthrew a democratically elected government; hence, Ayub was the root cause of all the confusion and chaos which ensued. Minister Asif supported the demand(s) for Article 6 proceedings against violators of the Constitution of Pakistan. Consequently, Minister Asif called for the corpse of dictator Ayub to be dug out of his grave and be hung for the offence of high treason in accordance with Article 6 of the Constitution of Pakistan.

== Family ==
After his death, his descendants became active in national politics in the 1990s until the present; however, these family members have been controversial. His son Gohar was an active member of the conservative PML(N) and was the Foreign Minister in the Sharif ministry in the 1990s but was removed due to his controversial and unauthorized statements about India. Ayub&#x27;s daughter Nasim did not enter politics and married Miangul Aurangzeb, the Wali of Swat.

His son Shaukat was a successful businessman and had four children: three sons and one daughter. All three sons went into business and politics, with Akbar, Arshad, and Yousaf Ayub Khan becoming successful members of the provincial and national assemblies.

His grandson, Omar, served in the Aziz ministry as a Finance Minister in the 2000s but joined the PML(N) in 2010; he was declared ineligible for the 2013 general election after allegations of vote rigging were proved. In 2018, he joined PTI. Another grandson, Yousaf, who is a party worker of the PTI, was also declared ineligible for submitting fake documents to the Election Commission.

<text>Paul Burney Johnson Jr. (January 23, 1916October 14, 1985) was an American attorney and Democratic politician from Mississippi, serving as 54th governor from January 1964 until January 1968. He was a son of former Mississippi Governor Paul B. Johnson Sr.

==Early life and education==
Paul B. Johnson Jr. grew up in a political family, as his father was a notable Democratic Party leader, serving as US Congressman from 1919 to 1923. The younger Johnson had an affectionate reverence for Franklin D. Roosevelt based on the days of his Congressman father&#x27;s friendship with the then-Assistant Secretary of the Navy (the families&#x27; children knew each other). In 1938, Johnson Sr. was elected as Governor of Mississippi, dying in office in 1943.

Johnson attended local schools, which were segregated under Jim Crow laws. He graduated from the University of Mississippi, where he met his college sweetheart Dorothy Power. During his first year at Ole Miss, he was a member of the freshman Ole Miss football team and was initiated into Sigma Alpha Epsilon social fraternity. He had the distinction of being the only sophomore ever elected as president of the Ole Miss student body. He also graduated from Ole Miss Law and passed the bar exam.

==Early career and military service==
Johnson became a practicing attorney in Jackson and Hattiesburg. After beginning his career, he married Dorothy Power in 1941. They had 4 children.

During World War II, Johnson served in the South Pacific with the United States Marine Corps. Upon his release from the service, Johnson wanted to enter politics. He gained an appointment as the Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Mississippi from 1948 to 1951.

As described by writer Theodore White, Johnson had, for a Southerner, a liberal early record. He supported Harry S. Truman for president in 1948 (Truman received just over ten percent of the vote in Mississippi), Adlai Stevenson in 1952. Johnson ran for governor three times: in 1947, 1951, and 1955, but was unsuccessful. In 1947, prior to his first try for the governor&#x27;s mansion, he also ran for an open U.S. Senate seat, but lost.

In 1951, when Johnson ran for governor of Mississippi, Percy Greene, a black newspaper editor publicly supported the Johnson ticket and rallied black voters to support him; this angered white voters who rallied to Mr. Johnson&#x27;s opponent. When Johnson lost the election he blamed Percy Greene and said Greene gave him the &quot;kiss of death&quot;.

In 1959, Johnson ran for lieutenant governor and won, serving under Governor Ross Barnett, who became a segregationist icon. Johnson played a prominent role in trying to prevent James Meredith from enrolling at Ole Miss in 1962, physically blocking (for the benefit of photographers) the federal marshals who were escorting the African-American veteran. 
Although Johnson felt that state politics were ill-suited for him, he ran for governor again in 1963. He defeated former governor James P. Coleman by tying his opponent to President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s civil rights legislation proposed that year. During the campaign, he asked voters to &quot;Stand tall with Paul&quot; against those wanting to change Mississippi&#x27;s &quot;way of life&quot;, in reference to his confrontation with federal marshals at Ole Miss.

In the general election, Johnson faced Rubel Phillips, originally from Corinth. He was the first strong Republican candidate for Mississippi governor since the end of Reconstruction in 1876, as the party was hobbled after the state passed a disfranchising constitution in 1890, effectively barring most blacks from the political system. In the 1960s, however, in contrast to Reconstruction, the Republican Party was appealing to white conservatives in the South.
Phillips, a recent Democratic state Public Service Commissioner, ran under the slogan &quot;K.O. (knock out) the Kennedys&quot;, and tried to tie Barnett and Johnson to the national Democrats. Phillips worked to convince voters that he and GOP lieutenant governor candidate Stanford Morse, a state senator from Gulfport, represented the best hope for preserving Mississippi&#x27;s traditional &quot;way of life&quot;, while at the same time making overall progress.

==Governor of Mississippi==
In historian Theodore H. White&#x27;s initial description of Johnson, he wrote:

this was no Northern cartoon of a Mississippi Governor; this was a man of civilization and dignity whose deep, serious voice spoke not cornpone but a cultured English—and spoke at once in fear, perplexity, and wistfulness. In his plight one could see half the tragedy of his state.

In his inaugural address in 1964, Johnson chose the &quot;Pursuit of Excellence&quot; as his term&#x27;s theme and said, &quot;Hate, or prejudice, or ignorance, will not lead Mississippi while I sit in the governor&#x27;s chair.&quot; To many, that comment had a hollow ring five months later, when during the investigation of the murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner in June 1964, Johnson offered little or no help. He praised Neshoba County Sheriff Lawrence A. Rainey and deputy sheriff Cecil Price. He also dismissed fears that the trio had been murdered, saying &quot;Maybe they went to Cuba,&quot; a reference to the country&#x27;s communist regime; opponents of the civil rights movement often suggested the movement was a communist plot.

James W. Silver, a history professor at Ole Miss, published a book condemning Mississippi&#x27;s segregated society; it became a bestseller and he had to leave the state. He wrote of the governor:

Probably satisfying no one, Johnson kept his own counsel, and his mouth closed to demagogic outbursts, while treading the uneasy path between the demands of the Citizens Council (which had helped elect him) and the imperatives of the situation. As one astute observer saw it, the governor was &quot;tempering political expedience with common sense, yet still attempting to ease down the more radical, emotional, ignorant groups without losing those votes.&quot; And so &quot;ambivalent Paul&quot; could denounce in picturesque and biting language the impending civil rights law and could declare that &quot;It is an odd thing that so much hell is being raised over three people missing in Mississippi when 10,000 are missing in New York.&quot;

At the same time, he officially welcomed federal officials, Allen Dulles and J. Edgar Hoover, to Mississippi for the investigation. He fired several members of the Ku Klux Klan from the Highway Patrol. He criticized civil rights workers and refused to meet with major African American leaders, but supported law enforcement and ending violence in Pike County. Historians believe that:

the two Johnsons, President and Governor, likely kept each other informed, though neither could have admitted that to his public ... In the meantime, the old &quot;watchdog of segregation&quot;, the State Sovereignty Commission, lapsed into desuetude from deliberate withholding of gubernatorial appointments, and the Citizens Council prepared its own death watch.

After recognizing the potentially damaging effects of racism on the state&#x27;s image and business climate, particularly in terms of attracting investment and new businesses, Johnson worked to tone down racist rhetoric. He adopted moderate policies, and asked residents to comply with the newly passed Voting Rights Act in 1965. He declared: &quot;The day for a lot of bull-shooting is over.&quot; His leadership was believed to have contributed to the decrease in racial violence in the state and to its solid economic growth. Johnson worked hard to pass a $130 million bond issue to finance a major expansion of the Ingalls Shipyard in Pascagoula. Like many other southern governors, Johnson quietly observed the 1965 Civil War centennial of the defeat of the Confederacy. In addition, his 1966 fight to repeal the prohibition on alcohol, a state law which for 48 years had been largely ignored by moonshiners, was another issue that gained him popular appeal. Johnson left politics following the end of his term.

He suffered a stroke in the late 1970s, and continued to struggle with his health in his final years. He suffered a fatal heart attack in 1985 at his home in Hattiesburg, and died surrounded by wife and family.

<text>4DTV is a proprietary broadcasting standard and technology for digital cable broadcasting and C-band/Ku-band satellite dishes from Motorola, using General Instrument&#x27;s DigiCipher II for encryption. It can tune in both analog VideoCipher II and digital DCII satellite channels.

== History ==
4DTV technology was originally developed in 1997 (the same year that DigiCipher was developed) by General Instrument/NextLevel and Motorola, now a division of ARRIS. The 4DTV format is contemporary to the DVB-based digital television broadcast standard but its completion came before that of DVB and thus it is similar but incompatible with the DVB standard. The DigiCipher 2 encryption system is used in digital channels much like the VideoCipher and VideoCipher II systems were used for analog encrypted transmissions. By the time when analogue VideoCipher II channels are switched to digital, all of the remaining VCII-encrypted channels (excluding in the clear) are transitioned to DigiCipher II on all satellites that carries either in the clear or VideoCipher II/II+/RS-encrypted channels. On December 31, 2010, Motorola abandoned support for 4DTV after 13 years when it was developed. This made all of the receivers to redirect to AMC-18 (also known as W5/X4 on the 4DTV system) instead of its other satellites that carried analog/VCII channels.

On August 24, 2016, at 9:18 AM EST, Headend In The Sky (the provider for 4DTV/DigiCipher II programming) transitioned to DVB-S2 (MPEG-2/256 QAM), meaning that support for 4DTV ended on that date.

== Technical specifications ==
== Usage ==
4DTV is designed for C-band/Ku-band based satellite dishes (both TVRO/direct-broadcast) in conjunction with the DigiCipher II system (for digital standard definition/high definition signals) and the VideoCipher II system (for analog signals). It is also used on Canada&#x27;s Shaw Direct (previously known as Star Choice) until 2017 when standard definition broadcasting ended in favour of HDTV exclusively, making the receivers obsolete.

=== Receiver/Decoders ===
4DTV receivers were designed to receive analog NTSC (except the DSR-905) in the clear or VideoCipherII channels and feeds, as well as digital Digicipher 2 channels as a TVRO satellite system on both C and Ku band-powered satellite dishes.

Four models are available, either new or refurbished:
*DSR-920 (discontinued as of 2003)
*DSR-921 (discontinued as of 2003)
*DSR-922 (made available in Fall 2000, discontinued) 
*DSR-905 (designed to work with analog 4DTV receivers and it can only receive DigiCipher II channels) (discontinued)

=== High definition access ===
The HDD-200 is a peripheral for 4DTV, it is used to access high definition channels via the Mult-Media Access Port. This peripheral is no longer in production.

=== Programming providers ===

In the United States, National Programming Service, LLC (NPS) was the primary provider of subscription programming to 4DTV and C band/Ku band users. They ceased operations as of December 26, 2010 after making a controversial attempt of converting all of their customers over to Dish Network which failed. The largest providers are now Satellite Receivers, Ltd. (SRL) and Skyvision who sell programming from the Headend In The Sky (HITS) service by Comcast and will continue to do so in 2011 and beyond. The HITS services use the Comcast Subscription Authorization Center (SAC) for the channels being broadcast on the AMC 18 satellite located at 105 degrees West (W5 or X4 tile on 4DTV). In Canada, Dr. Sat is now the primary provider for HITS subscription services offered on C-Band after Satellite Communications Source ceased operations.

Due to the removal of 4DTV/DigiCipher II channels on August 24, 2016, there are no more programming providers for the 4DTV in the United States and Canada. However, Shaw Direct still offers DigiCipher II programming in Canada, but not HITS programming.

=== Advantages ===
The 4DTV makes use of first-generation digital master feeds on several satellites and hundreds of channels. Therefore, a high quality signal is received, compared to other programming options that are typically compressed and re-uplinked. Being a C-band system, the 4DTV has the advantage of signal stability, great satellite footprint and no rainfade. This is a problem with services such as Dish Network and DirecTV satellite providers since they re-uplink on Ku and Ka bands.

=== Disadvantages ===
The master feeds for the many channels available can be scattered amongst multiple satellites. The actuator must slowly rotate the large dish into the desired satellite&#x27;s signal path, and then a further short delay for signal acquisition and lock. This procedure makes rapid &quot;channel surfing&quot; impossible outside the HITS provided channels.

<text>John Bell Williams (December 4, 1918 – March 25, 1983) was an American Democratic politician who represented Mississippi in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1947 to 1968 and served as the 55th governor of Mississippi from 1968 to 1972.

He was first elected to Congress at the age of just 27 in 1946, representing southwestern Mississippi. He was re-elected repeatedly to Congress through the 1966 election in what was then a one-party Democratic state, but was stripped of his congressional leadership positions after he publicly supported Republican Barry Goldwater in the 1964 presidential election.

Williams was elected governor in 1967, defeating numerous candidates. He had a history of supporting racial segregation but complied with a federal court order to finally desegregate Mississippi&#x27;s public schools.

==Early life and education==
John Bell Williams was born in 1918 in Raymond, the county seat of Hinds County, Mississippi, near the state capital of Jackson. He graduated in 1938 from Hinds Community College, then known as Hinds Junior College. He attended the University of Mississippi at Oxford and graduated in 1940 from Mississippi College School of Law, then known simply as the Jackson Law School.

In November 1941, he enlisted with the United States Army Air Corps and served as a pilot during World War II. He retired from active service after losing the lower part of his left arm as a result of a bomber crash in 1944.

==Political career==
In November 1946, Williams was elected at the age of 27 (he turned 28 in December) to the U.S. House of Representatives as a Democrat from southwestern Mississippi. He was the youngest U.S. Representative to have been elected from Mississippi.

Williams advocated states&#x27; rights and racial segregation. He joined his state&#x27;s delegation in a walkout of the 1948 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He supported Strom Thurmond&#x27;s Dixiecrat presidential campaign, whose primary platform was racial segregation. Thurmond easily carried the electoral vote in Mississippi and three other states in the Deep South.

After the Supreme Court issued its &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; ruling on May 17, 1954, which outlawed racial segregation in public schools, Williams made a speech on the House floor branding the day &#x27;Black Monday&#x27;, and subsequently signed the 1956 Southern Manifesto. Williams supported the Democratic Stevenson-Sparkman campaign in 1952, but he favored unpledged Democratic electors in 1956 and 1960.

In 1964, Williams endorsed Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater in the general election against incumbent Lyndon B. Johnson and helped raise funds for Goldwater in Mississippi. Because of his activities for Goldwater, the Democratic caucus (in the House of Representatives) stripped Williams and a colleague, Albert W. Watson of South Carolina, of their House seniority.

Williams remained a Democrat and retained his seat in 1966. Watson soon became a Republican.

===Governor===

In 1967, Williams ran for governor. The field of candidates was large, including former Governor Ross Barnett and two future governors, William Winter and Bill Waller. In the primary campaign, Williams claimed that, during the 1962 desegregation of the University of Mississippi, Barnett made a secret deal with the Kennedys over the admission of James Meredith, while publicly claiming to do everything to maintain college segregation.

In the first round of balloting, Williams finished second to Winter, the moderate candidate. In the runoff, Williams defeated Winter by 61,000 votes. In the general election, Williams handily defeated Democrat-turned-Republican Rubel Phillips, in his second unsuccessful campaign for governor. Phillips&#x27; running mate for lieutenant governor in 1963, Stanford Morse, a member of the Mississippi State Senate from Gulfport from 1956 to 1964, endorsed Williams in the 1967 race. During the campaign, Williams joked that when the returns were tabulated, the Republicans &quot;won&#x27;t be able to find a Rubel in the rubble.&quot;

During Williams&#x27; term as governor, Mississippi was ordered to desegregate its public school system by a federal court, as it had made little progress since the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that deemed such public schools unconstitutional. A case had been brought by civil rights activists and some desegregation of schools had happened at local levels. Williams did not defy the court. In December 1978, 24 years after &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, the Mississippi legislature officially removed from the state constitution the mandate that schools be segregated. In the ensuing popular election to confirm or reject this action, 29.90% of those voting voted against removing the language.

===Return to private practice===
After his term, Williams resumed his law practice. Williams endorsed Republicans Gerald Ford in 1976 and Ronald Reagan in 1980 for president, rather than the Democratic nominee both times, Jimmy Carter, despite the fact that Carter was also a Southerner.

==Death==
After leaving office, Williams divorced his wife. He died in Rankin County on March 25, 1983, being found dead in his apartment the following day; the cause was ruled to be a heart attack. He was buried on March 28, 1983, and his funeral was held in the First Baptist Church in Jackson the following day.

<text>An Embedded Operating System (EOS) is an operating system designed specifically for embedded computer systems. These systems aim to enhance functionality and reliability to perform dedicated tasks. When the multitasking method employed allows for timely task execution, such an OS may qualify as a real-time operating system (RTOS).

== Overview ==

Embedded Operating Systems are integral to consumer electronics such as cameras and mobile phones. Additionally, they power automotive electronics, aiding in functions like cruise control and navigation. Moreover, they are essential for factory automation infrastructure. Everyday applications of EOS include office automation devices such as image scanners, photocopiers, and wireless access points. Home automation systems, including security systems, also depend on EOS.

== Design ==
Embedded systems comprise a processor and corresponding software. Embedded software requires storage for executables and temporary data processing during runtime. Embedded systems typically utilize ROM and RAM as main memory components. For functionality, embedded systems necessitate input and output interfaces. Embedded hardware configurations are often unique, varying according to the application. Given the resource limitations of embedded system hardware, operating systems are designed with a narrow scope, tailored to specific applications to ensure optimal operation within hardware constraints. The choice of embedded operating system, which organizes and controls the hardware, often dictates the additional required embedded hardware components.

Software developers might write essential code in assembly language to harness the full processing power of the Central Processing Unit (CPU). Assembly language, being &quot;machine-efficient,&quot; can enhance speed in deterministic systems but may reduce portability and maintainability. Frequently, embedded operating systems are coded in portable programming languages like C.

==History==
===Early embedded operating systems===
The concept of a real-time multitasking kernel emerged in the late 1970s. During the 1980s, as embedded systems applications grew in complexity, operating systems with real-time multitasking kernels struggled to meet the evolving demands of embedded development. This led to the evolution of the real-time multitasking kernel into a comprehensive Operating System (RTOS), encompassing networking, file management, development, and debugging capabilities.

Today, RTOS constitues a global industry. In 1981, Ready System developed VRTX32, the world’s first commercial embedded real-time kernel. In 1993, following a merger, Ready System and Silicon Valley’s Microtec Research developed two new RTOS kernels, VRTX32 and VRTXsa, building upon VRTXmc. Concurrently, the VRTX integrated development environment, Spectra, was introduced.

In 1996, Microsoft released its embedded operating system, WinCE, which supported various processor architectures including x86, ARM, SH4, and MIPS. WinCE has since become obsolete, with mainstream support having ended in 2018.

OS-9 and VxWorks are also notable embedded operating systems.

=== Modern embedded operating systems ===
In the current landscape of the Internet of Things (IoT), embedded devices are ubiquitous, with cars alone utilizing hundreds of sensors. IoT systems, in contrast to traditional embedded systems, necessitate lower power consumption, enhanced safety and reliability, and the capability for ad hoc networking . The communication layer must facilitate the conversion between diverse protocols, while the application layer should enable cloud computing capabilities over the Internet.

==Contemporary embedded operating systems==
As a result, several new embedded operating systems have gained popularity, such as Embedded Linux variants (OpenWrt, Zeroshell, Android, LineageOS, LEDE, LibreCMC), OpenHarmony, Oniro OS, HarmonyOS, NetBSD, PX5 RTOS, ThreadX, FreeRTOS, Tock among others.

==Linux-based projects==
Numerous Linux-based projects, toolkits, and frameworks have been developed for creating operating systems that operate on a variety of embedded systems. Prominent examples of these include OpenEmbedded, BusyBox, uClibc, musl libc, and Buildroot.

<text>Windows CE, later known as Windows Embedded CE and Windows Embedded Compact, is a discontinued operating system developed by Microsoft for mobile and embedded devices. It was part of the Windows Embedded family and served as the software foundation of several products including the Handheld PC, Pocket PC, Auto PC, Windows Mobile, Windows Phone 7 and others.

Unlike Windows Embedded Standard, Windows For Embedded Systems, Windows Embedded Industry and Windows IoT, which are based on Windows NT, Windows CE uses a different hybrid kernel. Microsoft licensed it to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), who could modify and create their own user interfaces and experiences, with Windows Embedded Compact providing the technical foundation to do so.

Earlier versions of Windows CE worked on MIPS and SHx architectures, but in version 7.0 released in 2011—when the product was also renamed to Embedded Compact—support for these were dropped but remained for MIPS II architecture. The final version, Windows Embedded Compact 2013 (version 8.0), released in 2013, only supports x86 and ARM processors with board support package (BSP) directly. It had mainstream support until October 9, 2018, and extended support ended on October 10, 2023; however, license sales for OEMs will continue until 2028.

==Features==

Windows CE is optimized for devices that have minimal memory; a Windows CE kernel may run with one megabyte of memory. Devices are often configured without disk storage, and may be configured as a &quot;closed&quot; system that does not allow for end-user extension (for instance, it can be burned into ROM). Windows CE conforms to the definition of a real-time operating system, with a deterministic interrupt latency. From Version 3 and onward, the system supports 256 priority levels and uses priority inheritance for dealing with priority inversion. The fundamental unit of execution is the thread. This helps to simplify the interface and improve execution time.

The first version known during development under the code name &quot;Pegasus&quot; featured a Windows-like GUI and a number of Microsoft&#x27;s popular apps, all trimmed down for smaller storage, memory, and speed of the palmtops of the day. Since then, Windows CE has evolved into a component-based, embedded, real-time operating system. It is no longer targeted solely at hand-held computers. Many platforms have been based on the core Windows CE operating system, including Microsoft&#x27;s AutoPC, Pocket PC 2000, Pocket PC 2002, Windows Mobile 2003, Windows Mobile 2003 SE, Windows Mobile 5, Windows Mobile 6, Smartphone 2002, Smartphone 2003, Portable Media Center, Zune, Windows Phone 7 and many industrial devices and embedded systems. Windows CE even powered select games for the Sega Dreamcast and was the operating system of the Gizmondo handheld.

A distinctive feature of Windows CE compared to other Microsoft operating systems is that large parts of it are offered in source code form. First, source code was offered to several vendors, so they could adjust it to their hardware. Then products like Platform Builder (an integrated environment for Windows CE OS image creation and integration, or customized operating system designs based on CE) offered several components in source code form to the general public. However, a number of core components that do not need adaptation to specific hardware environments (other than the CPU family) are still distributed in binary only form.

Windows CE uses WCELDR as its boot loader, and uses manufacturer-prebuilt Registry to manage hardware devices.

Windows CE 2.11 was the first embedded Windows release to support a console and a Windows CE version of .

==History==

Windows Embedded Compact was formerly known as Windows CE. According to Microsoft, &quot;CE&quot; is not an explicit acronym for anything, although it implies a number of notions that Windows developers had in mind, such as &quot;compact&quot;, &quot;connectable&quot;, &quot;compatible&quot;, &quot;companion&quot; and &quot;efficient&quot;. The name changed once in 2006, with the release of Windows Embedded CE 6.0, and again in 2011, with the release of Windows Embedded Compact 7.

Windows CE was originally announced by Microsoft at the Computer Dealers&#x27; Exhibition (COMDEX) in 1996 and was demonstrated on stage by Bill Gates and John McGill. Microsoft had been testing Pegasus in early 1995 and released a strict reference platform to several hardware partners. The devices had to have the following minimum hardware specifications:

*SH3, MIPS 3000 or MIPS 4000 CPU
*Minimum of 4 MB of ROM
*Minimum of 2 MB of RAM with a backup power source, such as a CR2032 coin cell battery
*Powered by two AA batteries
*A physical QWERTY keyboard including Ctrl, Alt, and Shift keys
*A LCD of 480×240 pixels with four shades of gray and two bits per pixel with touchscreen that could be operated by either stylus or finger
*An IrDa transceiver
*Serial port
*PC Card socket
*Built-in speaker

Devices of the time mainly had 480×240 pixel displays with the exception of the Hewlett-Packard &#x27;Palmtop PC&#x27; which had a 640×240 display. Each window took over the full display. Navigation was done by tapping or double tapping on an item. A contextual menu was also available by the user pressing the ALT key and tapping on the screen. Windows CE 1.0 did not include a cascading Start menu, although Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0 did. Microsoft released the Windows CE 1.0 Power Toys that included a cascading menu icon that appeared in the system tray. Also bundled were several other utilities, most notable were a sound applet for the system tray, enabling the user to quickly mute or unmute their device or adjust the volume and a &#x27;pocket&#x27; version of Paint.

The release of Windows CE 2.0 was well received. Microsoft learned its lessons from consumer feedback of Windows CE 1.0 and made many improvements to the operating system. The Start menu was a cascading menu, identical to those found on Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0. Color screens were also supported and manufacturers raced to release the first color H/PC. The first to market was Hewlett Packard with the HP 620LX. Windows CE 2.0 also supported a broader range of CPU architectures. Programs could be also installed directly in the OS by double clicking on CAB files. Due to the nature of the ROMs that contained the operating system, users were not able to flash their devices with the newer operating system. Instead manufacturers released upgrade ROMs that users had to physically install in their devices, after removing the previous version. This would usually wipe the data on the device and present the user with the setup wizard upon first boot.

In November 1999, it was reported that Microsoft was planning to rename Windows CE to Windows Powered. The name only appeared in brand in Handheld PC 2000 and a build of Windows 2000 Advanced Server for network-attached storage devices (which bears no relation to Windows CE). Various Windows CE 3.0 products announced at CES 2001 were marketed under a &quot;Windows Powered&quot; umbrella name.

==Development tools==
===Visual Studio===
Microsoft Visual Studio 2012, 2013, and 2015 support apps and Platform Builder development for Windows Embedded Compact 2013.

Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 and earlier support projects for older releases of Windows CE/Windows Mobile, producing executable programs and platform images either as an emulator or attached by cable to an actual mobile device. A mobile device is not necessary to develop a CE program. The .NET Compact Framework supports a subset of the .NET Framework with projects in C#, and Visual Basic (.NET), but not Managed C++. &quot;Managed&quot; apps employing the .NET Compact Framework also require devices with significantly larger memories (8 MB or more) while unmanaged apps can still run successfully on smaller devices. In Visual Studio 2010, the Windows Phone Developer Tools are used as an extension, allowing Windows Phone 7 apps to be designed and tested within Visual Studio.

===Free Pascal and Lazarus===
Free Pascal introduced the Windows CE port in Version 2.2.0, targeting ARM and x86 architectures. Later, the Windows CE header files were translated for use with Lazarus, a rapid application development (RAD) software package based on Free Pascal. Windows CE apps are designed and coded in the Lazarus integrated development environment (IDE) and compiled with an appropriate cross compiler.

===Platform Builder===
This programming tool is used for building the platform (BSP + Kernel), device drivers (shared source or custom made) and also the apps. This is a one stop environment to get the system up and running. One can also use Platform Builder to export a software development kit (SDK) for the target microprocessor (SuperH, x86, MIPS, ARM etc.) to be used with another associated tool set named below.

===Others===
The Embedded Microsoft Visual C++ (eVC) a tool for development of embedded apps for Windows CE. It can be used standalone using the SDK exported from Platform Builder or using the Platform Builder&#x27;s Platform Manager connectivity setup.

CeGcc project provides GNU development tools, such as GNU C, GNU C++ and binutils that targeting Windows CE; 2 SDKs are available to choose from a standard Windows CE platform SDK based on MinGW, and a newlib-based SDK which may be easier for porting programs from POSIX systems.

CodeGear Delphi Prism runs in Visual Studio, also supports the .NET Compact Framework and thus can be used to develop mobile apps. It employs the Oxygene compiler created by RemObjects Software, which targets .NET, the .NET Compact Framework, and Mono. Its command-line compiler is available free of charge.

Basic4ppc a programming language similar to Embedded Visual Basic, targets the .NET Compact Framework and supports Windows CE and Windows Mobile devices.

GLBasic a very easy to learn and use BASIC dialect that compiles for many platforms, including Windows CE and Windows Mobile. It can be extended by writing inline C/C++ code.

LabVIEW a graphical programming language, supporting many platforms, including Windows CE.

MortScript is the semi-standard, extremely lightweight, automation SDK popular with the GPS enthusiasts. Uses the scripts written in its own language, with the syntax being aside to VBScript or JScript.

AutoHotkey a port of the open source macro-creation and automation software utility available for Windows CE. It allows the construction of macros and simple GUI apps developed by systems analyst Jonathan Maxian Timkang.

==Relationship to Windows Mobile, Pocket PC, and Smartphone==
Often Windows CE, Windows Mobile, and Pocket PC are used interchangeably, in part due to their common origin. This practice is not entirely accurate. Windows CE is a modular/componentized operating system that serves as the foundation of several classes of devices. Some of these modules provide subsets of other components&#x27; features (e.g. varying levels of windowing support; DCOM vs COM), others which are separate (bitmap or TrueType font support), and others which add additional features to another component. One can buy a kit (the Platform Builder) which contains all these components and the tools with which to develop a custom platform. Apps such as Excel Mobile (formerly Pocket Excel) are not part of this kit. The older Handheld PC version of Pocket Word and several other older apps are included as samples, however.

Windows Mobile is best described as a subset of platforms based on a Windows CE underpinning. Currently, Pocket PC (now called Windows Mobile Classic), Smartphone (Windows Mobile Standard), and Pocket PC Phone Edition (Windows Mobile Professional) are the three main platforms under the Windows Mobile umbrella. Each platform uses different components of Windows CE, plus supplemental features and apps suited for their respective devices.

Pocket PC and Windows Mobile are Microsoft-defined custom platforms for general PDA use, consisting of a Microsoft-defined set of minimum profiles (Professional Edition, Premium Edition) of software and hardware that is supported. The rules for manufacturing a Pocket PC device are stricter than those for producing a custom Windows CE-based platform. The defining characteristics of the Pocket PC are the touchscreen as the primary human interface device and its extremely portable size.

CE 3.0 is the basis for Pocket PC 2000 and Pocket PC 2002. A successor to CE 3.0 is CE.net. &quot;PocketPC [is] a separate layer of code on top of the core Windows CE OS… Pocket PC is based on Windows CE, but it&#x27;s a different offering.&quot; And licensees of Pocket PC are forbidden to modify the WinCE part.

The Smartphone platform is a feature-rich OS and interface for cellular phone handsets. SmartPhone offers productivity features to business users, such as email, and multimedia abilities for consumers. The SmartPhone interface relies heavily on joystick navigation and PhonePad input. Devices running SmartPhone do not include a touchscreen interface. SmartPhone devices generally resemble other cellular handset form factors, whereas most Phone Edition devices use a PDA form factor with a larger display.

<text>The fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus), also known as the finback whale or common rorqual, is a species of baleen whale and the second-longest cetacean after the blue whale. The biggest individual reportedly measured in length, with a maximum recorded weight of . The fin whale&#x27;s body is long, slender and brownish-gray in color, with a paler underside to appear less conspicuous from below (countershading).

At least two recognized subspecies exist, one in the North Atlantic and one across the Southern Hemisphere. It is found in all the major oceans, from polar to tropical waters, though it is absent only from waters close to the pack ice at the poles and relatively small areas of water away from the open ocean. The highest population density occurs in temperate and cool waters. Its prey mainly consists of smaller schooling fish, small squid, or crustaceans, including copepods and krill. Mating takes place in temperate, low-latitude seas during the winter. Fin whales are often observed in pods of 6–10 animals, with whom they communicate utilizing frequency-modulated sounds, ranging from 16 to 40 hertz.

Like all other large whales, the fin whale was a prized kill during the &quot;heyday&quot; of whaling, from 1840 to 1861. It remained so into the 20th century but decades of over harvesting contributed to declining numbers through the late 20th century. Over 725,000 fin whales were reportedly taken from the Southern Hemisphere between 1905 and 1976. Post-recovery numbers of the southern subspecies are predicted to be less than 50% of the pre-whaling population, even by 2100, due to long-lasting impacts of whaling and slow recovery rates. As of 2018, it was assessed as vulnerable by the IUCN.

== Taxonomy ==


The fin whale was first described by Friderich Martens in 1675 and by Paul Dudley in 1725. The former description was used as the primary basis for the species &quot;Balaena physalus&quot; by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. In 1804, Bernard Germain de Lacépède reclassified the species as &quot;Balaenoptera rorqual&quot;, based on a specimen that had stranded on Île Sainte-Marguerite (Cannes, France) in 1798. In 1830, Louis Companyo described a specimen that had been stranded near Saint-Cyprien, southern France, in 1828 as &quot;Balaena musculus&quot;. Most later authors followed him in using the specific name &quot;musculus&quot;, until Frederick W. True (1898) showed that it referred to the blue whale. In 1846, British taxonomist John Edward Gray described a specimen from the Falkland Islands as &quot;Balaenoptera australis&quot;. In 1865, German naturalist Hermann Burmeister described a roughly specimen found near Buenos Aires about 30 years earlier as &quot;Balaenoptera patachonicus&quot;. In 1903, Romanian scientist Emil Racoviță placed all these designations into &quot;Balaenoptera physalus&quot;. The word &quot;physalus&quot; comes from the Greek word &quot;physa&quot;, meaning &quot;blows,&quot; referring to the prominent blow of the species.

Fin whales are rorquals, members of the family Balaenopteridae, which includes the humpback whale, the blue whale, Bryde&#x27;s whale, the sei whale, and the minke whale. The family diverged from the other baleen whales in the suborder Mysticeti as long ago as the middle Miocene.

Recent DNA evidence indicates the fin whale may be more closely related to the humpback whale (&quot;Megaptera novaeangliae&quot;) and, in at least one study, the gray whale (&quot;Eschrichtius robustus&quot;), two whales in different genera, than it is to members of its own genus, such as the minke whales. 
As of 2023, four subspecies are named, each with distinct physical features and vocalizations. The northern fin whale, &quot;B. p. physalus&quot; (Linnaeus 1758) inhabits the North Atlantic and the southern fin whale, &quot;B. p. quoyi&quot; (Fischer 1829) occupies the Southern Hemisphere. Most experts consider the fin whales of the North Pacific to be a third subspecies—this was supported by a 2013 study, which found that the Northern Hemisphere &quot;B. p. physalus&quot; was not composed of a single subspecies. A 2019 genetic study concluded that the North Pacific fin whales should be considered a subspecies, suggesting the name &quot;B. p. velifera&quot; (Scammon 1869). The three groups mix at most rarely.

Clarke (2004) proposed a &quot;pygmy&quot; subspecies (&quot;B. p. patachonica&quot;, Burmeister, 1865) that is purportedly darker in colour and has black baleen. He based this on a single physically mature female caught in the Antarctic in 1947–48, the smaller average size (a few feet) of sexually and physically mature fin whales caught by the Japanese around 50°S, and smaller, darker sexually immature fin whales caught in the Antarctic which he believed were a &quot;migratory phase&quot; of his proposed subspecies. The subspecies has not been genetically established, and is not recognized by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.

=== Hybrids ===

The genetic distance between blue and fin whales has been compared to that between a chimpanzee and human (3.5 million years on the evolutionary tree.) Nevertheless, hybrid individuals between blue and fin whales with characteristics of both are known to occur with relative frequency in both the North Atlantic and North Pacific.

The DNA profile of a sampling of whale meat in the Japanese market found evidence of blue/fin hybrids. Similarly, a whale caught by whalers off the coast of Iceland in 2018 was found to be a hybrid descended from a female blue whale and a male fin whale. A 2024 genome analysis of North Atlantic blue whales found that approximately 3.5% of their genome was derived from hybridization with fin whales. The gene flow was determined to be unidirectional from fin to blue whales. Despite their smaller size, fin whales have similar cruising and sprinting speeds to blue whales, which would allow fin males to complete courtship chases with blue females.

== Anatomy ==

The body is relatively thin with a slender rostrum and large hook-like dorsal fin that is situated in the posterior fourth of the body. It has an elongated ridge on its back, and around 350 to 400 baleen plates. Like all rorquals, the fin whale has grooves between the tip of the lower jaw and the navel.

Among whale species, the fin whale is exceeded in size only by the blue whale. Adults usually average 40 to 50 tonnes in weight. Males have a mean length of , and females of . They are sexually dimorphic, with females generally being longer and heavier than males. The largest specimens can attain lengths of over and weights of 77 to 81 tonnes.
The fin whale is brownish to dark or light gray dorsally and white ventrally. The left side of the head is dark gray, while the right side exhibits a complex pattern of contrasting light and dark markings. The right lower jaw is white or light gray, which sometimes extends laterally and dorsally unto the upper jaw. Dark, oval-shaped areas of pigment called &quot;flipper shadows&quot; extend below and posterior to the pectoral fins.

The penis size of fin whales typically reaches a length of ; the testes usually weigh in mature individuals. The oral cavity of the fin whale has a very stretchy or extensible nerve system which aids them in feeding.

== Life history ==

Mating takes place during the winter months, in temperate, low-latitude waters, and the gestation period lasts between 11 and 12 months. At 6 or 7 months of age, when it is in length, a newborn weans from its mother, and the calf accompanies its mother to the summer feeding area. Although reports of up to six foetuses have been made, single births are far more typical. Females reproduce every two to three years. In the Northern Hemisphere, females reach sexual maturity between the ages of 6 and 12 at lengths of , and around in the Southern Hemisphere. Calves remain with their mothers for about a year.

Full physical maturity is attained between 25 and 30 years. Fin whales have a maximum life span of at least 94 years of age, although specimens have been found aged at an estimated 135–140 years. The fin whale is one of the fastest cetaceans and can sustain speeds between and and bursts up to have been recorded, earning the fin whale the nickname &quot;the greyhound of the sea&quot;. Fin whales are more gregarious than other rorquals, and often live in groups of 6–10, although feeding groups may reach up to 100 animals.

=== Vocalizations ===
Like other whales, males make long, loud, low-frequency sounds. The vocalizations of blue and fin whales are the lowest-frequency sounds made by any animal. Most sounds are frequency-modulated (FM) down-swept infrasonic pulses from 16 to 40 hertz frequency (the range of sounds that most humans can hear falls between 20 hertz and 20 kilohertz). Each sound lasts one to two seconds, and various sound combinations occur in patterned sequences lasting 7 to 15 minutes each. The whale then repeats the sequences in bouts lasting up to many days. The vocal sequences have source levels of up to 184–186 decibels relative to 1 micropascal at a reference distance of one metre and can be detected hundreds of miles from their source.

When fin whale sounds were first recorded by US biologists, they did not realize that these unusually loud, long, pure and regular sounds were being made by whales. They first investigated the possibilities that the sounds were due to equipment malfunction, geophysical phenomena, or even part of a Soviet Union scheme for detecting enemy submarines. Eventually, biologists demonstrated that the sounds were the vocalizations of fin whales.

Direct association of these vocalizations with the reproductive season for the species and that only males make the sounds point to these vocalizations as possible reproductive displays. Over the past 100 years, the dramatic increase in ocean noise from shipping and naval activity may have slowed the recovery of the fin whale population, by impeding communications between males and receptive females. Fin whale songs can penetrate over below the sea floor and seismologists can use those song waves to assist in underwater surveys.

=== Breathing ===
When feeding, fin whales blow five to seven times in quick succession, but while traveling or resting will blow once every minute or two. On their terminal (last) dive they arch their back high out of the water, but rarely raise their flukes out of the water. They then dive to depths of up to when feeding or a few hundred feet when resting or traveling. The average feeding dive off California and Baja lasts 6 minutes, with a maximum of 17 minutes; when traveling or resting they usually dive for only a few minutes at a time.

== Ecology ==

=== Range and habitat ===
Like many large rorquals, the fin whale is a cosmopolitan species. It is found in all the world&#x27;s major oceans and in waters ranging from the polar to the tropical. It is absent only from waters close to the ice pack at both the north and south extremities and relatively small areas of water away from the large oceans, such as the Red Sea, although they can reach into the Baltic Sea, a marginal sea of such conditions. The highest population density occurs in temperate and cool waters. It is less densely populated in the warmest, equatorial regions.

The North Atlantic fin whale has an extensive distribution, occurring from the Gulf of Mexico and Mediterranean Sea, northward to Baffin Bay and Spitsbergen. In general, fin whales are more common north of approximately 30°N latitude, but considerable confusion arises about their occurrence south of 30°N latitude because of the difficulty in distinguishing fin whales from Bryde&#x27;s whales. Extensive ship surveys have led researchers to conclude that the summer feeding range of fin whales in the western North Atlantic is mainly between 41°20&#x27;N and 51°00&#x27;N, from shore seaward to the contour.

Summer distribution of fin whales in the North Pacific is the immediate offshore waters from central Baja California to Japan and as far north as the Chukchi Sea bordering the Arctic Ocean. They occur in high densities in the northern Gulf of Alaska and southeastern Bering Sea between May and October, with some movement through the Aleutian passes into and out of the Bering Sea. Several whales tagged between November and January off southern California were killed in the summer off central California, Oregon, British Columbia, and in the Gulf of Alaska. Fin whales have been observed feeding 250 miles south of Hawaii in mid-May, and several winter sightings have been made there. Some researchers have suggested that the whales migrate into Hawaiian waters primarily in the autumn and winter.

Although fin whales are certainly migratory, moving seasonally in and out of high-latitude feeding areas, the overall migration pattern is not well understood. Acoustic readings from passive-listening hydrophone arrays indicate a southward migration of the North Atlantic fin whale occurs in the autumn from the Labrador-Newfoundland region, south past Bermuda, and into the West Indies. One or more populations of fin whales are thought to remain year-round in high latitudes, moving offshore, but not southward in late autumn. A study based on resightings of identified fin whales in Massachusetts Bay indicates that calves often learn migratory routes from their mothers and return to their mother&#x27;s feeding area in subsequent years.

In the Pacific, migration patterns are poorly characterized. Although some fin whales are apparently present year-round in the Gulf of California, there is a significant increase in their numbers in the winter and spring. Southern fin whales migrate seasonally from relatively high-latitude Antarctic feeding grounds in the summer to low-latitude breeding and calving areas in the winter. The location of winter breeding areas is still unknown, since these whales tend to migrate in the open ocean.

It has been shown that populations of fin whales within the Mediterranean have preferred feeding locations that partially overlap with high concentrations of plastic pollution and microplastic debris. High concentrations of microplastics most likely overlap with fin whales&#x27; preferred feeding grounds because both microplastic and the whale&#x27;s food sources are near high trophic upwelling areas.
The total historical North Pacific population was estimated at 42,000 to 45,000 before the start of whaling. Of this, the population in the eastern portion of the North Pacific was estimated to be 25,000 to 27,000. Surveys conducted in 1991, 1993, 1996, and 2001 produced estimates between 1,600 and 3,200 off California and 280 and 380 off Oregon and Washington. Surveys in coastal waters of British Columbia in summers 2004 and 2005 produced abundance estimates of approximately 500 animals. Fin whales might have started returning to the coastal waters off British Columbia (a sighting occurred in Johnstone Strait in 2011) and Kodiak Island. Size of the local population migrating to Hawaiian Archipelago is unknown.

Finbacks are also relatively abundant along the coast of Peru and Chile (in Chile, most notably off Los Lagos region such as Gulf of Corcovado in Chiloé National Park, , port of Mejillones, and Caleta Zorra. Year-round confirmations indicate possible residents off pelagic north eastern to central Chile such as around coastal Caleta Chañaral and Pingüino de Humboldt National Reserve, east of Juan Fernández Islands, and northeast of Easter Island and possible wintering ground exist for eastern south Pacific population.

Among Northern Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal, such as along Sri Lanka, India, and Malaysia, sightings and older records of fin whales exist.

=== Predation ===
The only known predator of the fin whale is the killer whale, with at least 20 eyewitness and second-hand accounts of attack or harassment. They usually flee and offer little resistance to attack. Only a few confirmed fatalities have occurred. In October 2005, 16 killer whales attacked and killed a fin whale in the Canal de Ballenas, Gulf of California, after chasing it for about an hour. They fed on its sinking carcass for about 15 minutes before leaving the area. In June 2012, a pod of killer whales was seen in La Paz Bay, in the Gulf of California, chasing a fin whale for over an hour before finally killing it and feeding on its carcass. The whale bore numerous tooth rakes over its back and dorsal fin; several killer whales flanked it on either side, with one individual visible under water biting at its right lower jaw. In July 1908, a whaler reportedly saw two killer whales attack and kill a fin whale off western Greenland. In January 1984, seven were seen from the air circling, holding the flippers, and ramming a fin whale in the Gulf of California, but the observation ended at nightfall.

=== Feeding ===

The fin whale is a filter-feeder, feeding on small schooling fish, squid and crustaceans including copepods and krill. In the North Pacific, they feed on krill in the genera &quot;Euphausia&quot;, &quot;Thysanoessa&quot;, and &quot;Nyctiphanes&quot;, large copepods in the genus &quot;Neocalanus&quot;, small schooling fish (e.g. the genera &quot;Engraulis&quot;, &quot;Mallotus&quot;, &quot;Clupea&quot;, and &quot;Theragra&quot;), and squid. Based on stomach content analysis of over 19,500 fin whales caught by the Japanese whaling fleet in the North Pacific from 1952 to 1971, 64.1% contained only krill, 25.5% copepods, 5.0% fish, 3.4% krill and copepods and 1.7% squid. Nemoto (1959) analyzed the stomach contents of about 7500 fin whales caught in the northern North Pacific and Bering Sea from 1952 to 1958, found that they mainly preyed on euphausiids around the Aleutian Islands and in the Gulf of Alaska and schooling fish in the northern Bering Sea and off Kamchatka.

Of the fin whale stomachs sampled off British Columbia between 1963 and 1967, euphausiids dominated the diet for four of the five years (82.3 to 100% of the diet), while copepods only formed a major portion of the diet in 1965 (35.7%). Miscellaneous fish, squid, and octopus played only a very minor part of the diet in two of the five years (3.6 to 4.8%). Fin whales caught off California between 1959 and 1970 fed on the pelagic euphausiid &quot;Euphausia pacifica&quot; (86% of sampled individuals), the more neritic euphausiid &quot;Thysanoessa spinifera&quot; (9%), and the northern anchovy (&quot;Engraulis mordax&quot;) (7%); only trace amounts (&lt;0.5% each) were found of Pacific saury (&quot;C. saira&quot;) and juvenile rockfish (&quot;Sebastes jordani&quot;). 

In the North Atlantic, they prey on euphausiids in the genera &quot;Meganyctiphanes&quot;, &quot;Thysanoessa&quot; and &quot;Nyctiphanes&quot; and small schooling fish (e.g. the genera &quot;Clupea&quot;, &quot;Mallotus&quot;, and &quot;Ammodytes&quot;). Of the 1,609 fin whale stomachs examined at the Hvalfjörður whaling station in southwestern Iceland from 1967 to 1989 (caught between June and September), 96% contained only krill, 2.5% krill and fish, 0.8% some fish remains, 0.7% capelin (&quot;M. villosus&quot;), and 0.1% sandeel (family Ammodytidae); a small proportion of (mainly juvenile) blue whiting (&quot;Micromesistius poutassou&quot;) were also found. Of the krill sampled between 1979 and 1989, the vast majority (over 99%) was northern krill (&quot;Meganyctiphanes norvegica&quot;); only one stomach contained &quot;Thysanoessa longicaudata&quot;. Off West Greenland, 75% of the fin whales caught between July and October had consumed krill (family Euphausiidae), 17% capelin (&quot;Mallotus&quot;) and 8% sand lance (&quot;Ammodytes sp.&quot;). Off eastern Newfoundland, they chiefly feed on capelin, but also take small quantities of euphausiids (mostly &quot;T. raschii&quot; and &quot;T. inermis&quot;). In the Ligurian-Corsican-Provençal Basin in the Mediterranean Sea they make dives as deep as to feed on the euphausiid &quot;Meganyctiphanes norvegica&quot;, while off the island of Lampedusa, between Tunisia and Sicily, they have been observed in mid-winter feeding on surface swarms of the small euphausiid &quot;Nyctiphanes couchi&quot;.

In the Southern Hemisphere, they feed almost exclusively on euphausiids (mainly the genera &quot;Euphausia&quot; and &quot;Thysanoessa&quot;), as well as taking small amounts of amphipods (e.g. &quot;Themisto gaudichaudii&quot;) and various species of fish. Of the more than 16,000 fin whales caught by the Japanese whaling fleet in the Southern Hemisphere between 1961 and 1965 that contained food in their stomachs, 99.4% fed on euphausiids, 0.5% on fish, and 0.1% on amphipods. In the Southern Ocean they mainly consume &quot;E. superba&quot;.

The animal feeds by opening its jaws while swimming at some in one study, which causes it to engulf up to of water in one gulp. It then closes its jaws and pushes the water back out of its mouth through its baleen, which allows the water to leave while trapping the prey. An adult has between 262 and 473 baleen plates on each side of the mouth. Each plate is made of keratin that frays out into fine hairs on the ends inside the mouth near the tongue. Each plate can measure up to in length and in width. 

The whale routinely dives to depths of more than where it executes an average of four &quot;lunges&quot;, to accumulate krill. Each gulp provides the whale with approximately of food. One whale can consume up to of food a day, leading scientists to conclude that the whale spends about three hours a day feeding to meet its energy requirements, roughly the same as humans. If prey &quot;patches&quot; are not sufficiently dense, or are located too deep in the water, the whale has to spend a larger portion of its day searching for food. One hunting technique is to circle schools of fish at high speed, frightening the fish into a tight ball, then turning on its side before engulfing the massed prey.

=== Parasites, epibiotics, and pathology ===
Fin whales suffer from a number of pathological conditions. The parasitic copepod &quot;Pennella balaenopterae&quot;—usually found on the flank of fin whales—burrows into their blubber to feed on their blood, while the pseudo-stalked barnacle &quot;Xenobalanus globicipitis&quot; is generally found more often on the dorsal fin, pectoral fins, and flukes.

Other barnacles found on fin whales include the acorn barnacle &quot;Coronula reginae&quot; and the stalked barnacle &quot;Conchoderma auritum&quot;, which attaches to &quot;Coronula&quot; or the baleen. The harpacticid copepod &quot;Balaenophilus unisetus&quot; (heavy infestations of which have been found in fin whales caught off northwestern Spain) and the ciliate &quot;Haematophagus&quot; also infest the baleen, the former feeding on the baleen itself and the latter on red blood cells.

The remora &quot;Remora australis&quot; and occasionally the amphipod &quot;Cyamus balaenopterae&quot; can also be found on fin whales, both feeding on the skin. Infestations of the giant nematode &quot;Crassicauda boopis&quot; can cause inflammation of the renal arteries and potential kidney failure, while the smaller &quot;C. crassicauda&quot; infects the lower urinary tract. Out of 87 whales taken and necropsied from the North Atlantic, infection from &quot;Crassicauda&quot; &quot;boopis&quot; was found to be very prevalent and invasive, indicating high probability that it was responsible for causing death in these whales. &quot;C. boopis&quot; was found in 94% of the whales examined. The worms were usually enveloped by &quot;exuberant tissue reactions which in some whales obstructed multiple renal veins&quot;. The parasite was most likely by environmental contamination, involving shedding of larvae in urine. Major inflammatory lesions in the mesenteric arteries suggested that the worm larvae were ingested and migrated to the kidney.

These observations suggest that infection from &quot;C. boopis&quot; can be &quot;lethal by inducing congestive renal failure&quot;. Injury to the vascular system is also a result of moderate infections. Therefore, the implication can be made that the feeding migration of fin whales every year in circumpolar waters can be associated with pathologic risk.

An emaciated female fin whale, which stranded along the Belgian coast in 1997, was found to be infected with lesions of &quot;Morbillivirus&quot;. In January 2011, a emaciated adult male fin whale stranded dead on the Tyrrhenian coastline of Italy was found to be infected with &quot;Morbillivirus&quot; and the protozoa &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot;, as well as carrying heavy loads of organochlorine pollutants.

=== Whaling ===


In the 19th century, the fin whale was occasionally hunted by open-boat whalers, but it was relatively safe, because it could easily outrun ships of the time and often sank when killed, making the pursuit a waste of time for whalers. However, the later introduction of steam-powered boats and harpoons that exploded on impact made it possible to kill and secure them along with blue and sei whales on an industrial scale. As other whale species became overhunted, the whaling industry turned to the still-abundant fin whale as a substitute. It was primarily hunted for its blubber, oil, and baleen. Around 704,000 fin whales were caught in Antarctic whaling operations alone between 1904 and 1975.

The introduction of factory ships with stern slipways in 1925 substantially increased the number of whales taken per year. By 1962–63, sei whale catches began to increase as fin whales became scarce. From the late 19th century until the 1960s, fin whales were a major target of whaling in the Sea of Japan. Japan took 300 to 400 fin whales per year in the Sea of Japan and East China Sea in the 1910s and 100 to 200 per year in the 1920s. After World War II, Korean whaling companies began hunting fin whales in these waters, and China and North Korea may have joined the hunt, but by the 1960s, the number of whales caught declined sharply due to population decline, and minke whales became the primary target in these waters.

The IWC prohibited hunting in the Southern Hemisphere in 1976. The Soviet Union engaged in the illegal killing of protected whale species in the North Pacific and Southern Hemisphere, over-reporting fin whale catches to cover up illegal takes of other species. The fin whale was given full protection from commercial whaling by the IWC in the North Pacific in 1976, and in the North Atlantic in 1987, with small exceptions for aboriginal catches and catches for research purposes. All populations worldwide remain listed as endangered species by the US National Marine Fisheries Service and the International Conservation Union Red List.

The IWC has set a quota of 19 fin whales per year for Greenland. Meat and other products from whales killed in these hunts are widely marketed within Greenland, but export is illegal. Iceland and Norway are not bound by the IWC&#x27;s moratorium on commercial whaling because both countries filed objections to it.

In the Southern Hemisphere, Japan permitted annual takes of 10 fin whales under its Antarctic Special Permit whaling program for the 2005–2006 and 2006–2007 seasons. The proposal for 2007–2008 and the subsequent 12 seasons allowed takes of 50 per year. In 2019, Japan left the International Whaling Commission (IWC) and resumed commercial whaling. Japan reported a catch of 212 total whales in both 2020 and 2021; however, no fin whale catches have yet been reported.

=== Ship interaction ===
Collisions with ships are a major cause of mortality. In some areas, they cause a substantial portion of large whale strandings. Most serious injuries are caused by large, fast-moving ships over or near continental shelves.

A 60-foot-long fin whale was found stuck on the bow of a container ship in New York harbour on 12 April 2014. Two dead fin whales, one 65 feet and one 25 feet, were discovered stuck to the Australian destroyer HMAS &quot;Sydney&quot; in May 2021 when the ship arrived in Naval Base San Diego.

Ship collisions frequently occur in Tsushima Strait and result in damage done to whales, passengers, and vessels. In response the Japanese Coast Guard has started a surveillance program to monitor large cetacean activity in Tsushima Strait to inform operating vessels in the area.

=== Whale watching ===
Fin whales are regularly encountered on whale-watching excursions worldwide. In Monterey Bay and the Southern California Bight, fin whales are encountered year-round, with the best sightings between November and March. They can even be seen from land (for example, from Point Vicente, Palos Verdes, where they can be seen lunge feeding at the surface only a half mile to a few miles offshore). They are regularly sighted in the summer and fall in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the Gulf of Maine, the Bay of Fundy, the Bay of Biscay, Strait of Gibraltar, and the Mediterranean. In southern Ireland, they are seen inshore from June to February, with peak sightings in November and December.

=== Conservation ===
As of 2018, the global fin whale population is estimated to be 100,000 mature individuals. There are an estimated total of 70,000 individuals in the North Atlantic, 50,000 in the North Pacific, and 25,000 in the Southern Hemisphere.

The fin whale is listed as a vulnerable species on the IUCN Red List. They are also included in the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The fin whale is listed on both Appendix I and Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). Commercial whaling of the species was officially banned in 1976, both in the North Pacific and Southern Hemisphere. Post-whaling populations have steadily increased. The fin whale is still hunted off the waters of West Greenland, and in the Antarctic Ocean by Japanese researchers.

They may also become entangled in fishing gear in some rare instances. Military sonar may effect the behavioral patterns of fin whales, which can lead to population decline. Similarly, whale watching may cause fin whales to alter their behavior and foraging habits.

The fin whale is covered by the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area (ACCOBAMS) and the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific Cetaceans MOU).

<doc id="230364" wikidata="Q180044" url="?curid=230364" title="Pumice">
<text>Pumice (), called pumicite in its powdered or dust form, is a volcanic rock that consists of extremely vesicular rough-textured volcanic glass, which may or may not contain crystals. It is typically light-colored. Scoria is another vesicular volcanic rock that differs from pumice in having larger vesicles, thicker vesicle walls, and being dark colored and denser.

Pumice is created when super-heated, highly pressurized rock is rapidly ejected from a volcano. The unusual foamy configuration of pumice happens because of simultaneous rapid cooling and rapid depressurization. The depressurization creates bubbles by lowering the solubility of gases (including water and CO2) that are dissolved in the lava, causing the gases to rapidly exsolve (like the bubbles of CO2 that appear when a carbonated drink is opened). The simultaneous cooling and depressurization freeze the bubbles in a matrix. Eruptions under water are rapidly cooled and the large volume of pumice created can be a shipping hazard for cargo ships.

==Properties==
Pumice is composed of highly microvesicular glass pyroclastic with very thin, translucent bubble walls of extrusive igneous rock. It is commonly but not exclusively of silicic or felsic to intermediate in composition (e.g., rhyolitic, dacitic, andesite, pantellerite, phonolite, trachyte), but basaltic and other compositions are known. Pumice is commonly pale in color, ranging from white, cream, blue or grey, to green-brown or black. It forms when volcanic gases exsolving from viscous magma form bubbles that remain within the viscous magma as it cools to glass. Pumice is a common product of explosive eruptions (plinian and ignimbrite-forming) and commonly forms zones in upper parts of silicic lavas. Pumice has a porosity of 64–85% by volume and it floats on water, possibly for years, until it eventually becomes waterlogged and sinks.

Scoria differs from pumice in being denser. With larger vesicles and thicker vesicle walls, scoria sinks rapidly. The difference is the result of the lower viscosity of the magma that forms scoria. When larger amounts of gas are present, the result is a finer-grained variety of pumice known as pumicite. Pumicite consists of particles less than in size. Pumice is considered a volcanic glass because it has no crystal structure. Pumice varies in density according to the thickness of the solid material between the bubbles; many samples float in water. After the explosion of Krakatoa, rafts of pumice drifted through the Indian Ocean for up to 20 years, with tree trunks floating among them. In fact, pumice rafts disperse and support several marine species. In 1979, 1984 and 2006, underwater volcanic eruptions near Tonga created large pumice rafts that floated hundreds of kilometres to Fiji.
There are two main forms of vesicles. Most pumice contains tubular microvesicles that can impart a silky or fibrous fabric. The elongation of the microvesicles occurs due to ductile elongation in the volcanic conduit or, in the case of pumiceous lavas, during flow. The other form of vesicles are subspherical to spherical and result from high vapor pressure during an eruption. Reticulite is a type of basaltic pumice formed in very high lava fountains. It has an extremely low density and is composed of a network of volcanic glass formed when the vesicles have almost completely coalesced.

==Etymology==
Pumice is an igneous rock with a foamy appearance. The name is derived from the Latin word &quot;pumex&quot; (meaning &quot;pumice&quot;) which is related to the Latin word &quot;spuma&quot; meaning &quot;foam&quot;. In former times, pumice was called &quot;Spuma Maris&quot;, meaning &quot;froth of the sea&quot; in Latin because the frothy material was thought to be hardened sea foam. Around 80 B.C., it was called &quot;lapis spongiae&quot; in Latin for its vesicular properties. Many Greek scholars decided there were different sources of pumice, one of which was in the sea coral category.

==Distribution==
Pumice can be found all around the globe deriving from continental volcanic occurrences and submarine volcanic occurrences. Floating stones can also be distributed by ocean currents. As described earlier pumice is produced by the eruption of explosive volcanoes under certain conditions, therefore, natural sources occur in volcanically active regions. Pumice is mined and transported from these regions. In 2011, Italy and Turkey led pumice mining production at 4 and 3 million tons respectively; other large producers at or exceeding a million tonnes were Greece, Iran, Chile, and Syria. Total world pumice production in 2011 was estimated at 17 million tonnes.

===Asia===
There are large reserves of pumice in Asian countries including Afghanistan, Indonesia, Japan, Syria, Iran, and eastern Russia. Considerable amounts of pumice can be found at the Kamchatka Peninsula on the eastern flank of Russia. This area contains 19 active volcanoes and it lies in close proximity with the Pacific volcanic belt. Asia is also the site of the second-most dangerous volcanic eruption in the 20th century, Mount Pinatubo, which erupted on June 12, 1991 in the Philippines. Ash and pumice lapilli were distributed over a mile around the volcano. These ejections filled trenches that once reached 660 feet deep. So much magma was displaced from the vent that the volcano became a depression on the surface of the Earth. Another well-known volcano that produces pumice is Krakatoa. An eruption in 1883 ejected so much pumice that kilometers of sea were covered in floating pumice and in some areas rose 1.5 meters above sea level.

===Europe===
Europe is the largest producer of pumice with deposits in Italy, Turkey, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, and Germany. Italy is the largest producer of pumice because of its numerous eruptive volcanoes. On the Aeolian Islands of Italy, the island of Lipari is entirely made up of volcanic rock, including pumice. Large amounts of igneous rock on Lipari are due to the numerous extended periods of volcanic activity from the Late Pleistocene (Tyrrhenian) to the Holocene.

===North America===
Pumice can be found all across North America including on the Caribbean Islands. In the United States, pumice is mined in Nevada, Oregon, Idaho, Arizona, California, New Mexico and Kansas. U.S. production of pumice and pumicite in 2011 was estimated at 380,000 tonnes, valued at $7.7 million with approximately 46% coming from Nevada and Oregon. Idaho is also known as a large producer of pumice because of the quality and brightness of the rock found in local reserves. One of the most famous volcanoes was Mount Mazama that erupted 7,700 years ago in Oregon and deposited 300 feet of pumice and ash around the vent. The large amount of magma that was erupted caused the structure to collapse, forming a caldera now known as Crater Lake.

===South America===
Chile is one of the leading producers of pumice in the world. The Puyehue-Cordón Caulle are two coalesced volcanoes in the Andes mountains that ejected ash and pumice across Chile and Argentina. A recent eruption in 2011 wreaked havoc on the region by covering all surfaces and lakes in ash and pumice.

===Africa===
Kenya, Ethiopia and Tanzania have some deposits of pumice. 

===New Zealand===
The Havre Seamount volcano produced the largest-known deep ocean volcanic eruption on Earth. The volcano erupted in July 2012 but remained unnoticed until enormous pieces of pumice were seen to be floating on the Pacific Ocean. Blankets of rock reached a thickness of 5 meters. Most of this floating pumice is deposited on the northwest coast of New Zealand and the Polynesia islands.

==Mining==
The mining of pumice is an environmentally friendly process compared with other mining methods because the igneous rock is deposited on the surface of the earth in loose aggregate form. The material is mined by open-pit methods. Soils are removed by machinery in order to obtain more pure quality pumice. Scalping screens are used to filter impure surficial pumice of organic soils and unwanted rocks. Blasting is not necessary because the material is unconsolidated, therefore only simple machinery is used such as bulldozers and power shovels. Different sizes of pumice are needed for specific uses therefore crushers are used to achieve desired grades ranging from lump, coarse, intermediate, fine, and extra fine.

==Uses==
Pumice is a very lightweight, porous and abrasive material and it has been used for centuries in the construction and beauty industry as well as in early medicine. It is also used as an abrasive, especially in polishes, pencil erasers, and the production of stone-washed jeans. Pumice was also used in the early book-making industry to prepare parchment paper and leather bindings. There is high demand for pumice, particularly for water filtration, chemical spill containment, cement manufacturing, horticulture and increasingly for the pet industry. The mining of pumice in environmentally sensitive areas has been under more scrutiny after such an operation was stopped in the U.S. state of Oregon, at Rock Mesa in the southern part of the Three Sisters Wilderness.

===Early medicine===
Pumice has been used in the medicinal industry for more than 2000 years. Ancient Chinese medicine used ground pumice along with ground mica and fossilized bones added to teas to calm the spirit. This tea was used to treat dizziness, nausea, insomnia, and anxiety disorders. Ingestion of these pulverized rocks was believed to be able to soften nodules and was later used with other herbal ingredients to treat gallbladder cancer and urinary difficulties. In Western medicine, beginning in the early 18th century, pumice ground into a sugar consistency mixed with other ingredients was used to attempt to treat ulcers mostly on the skin and cornea. Concoctions such as these were also used to help wounds scar in a supposedly healthier manner. In approximately 1680 it was noted by an English naturalist that pumice powder was used to promote sneezing.

=== Personal care ===

Pumice has been used as a material in personal care for thousands of years. It is an abrasive material that can be used in powdered form or as a stone to remove unwanted hair or skin. In ancient Egypt, it was common to remove all hair on the body to control lice and as a form of ritual purification, using creams, razors, and pumice stones. Pumice in powdered form was an ingredient in toothpastes in ancient Rome. Nail care was very important in ancient China; nails were kept groomed with pumice stones, and pumice stones were also used to remove calluses. 

It was discovered in a Roman poem that pumice was used to remove dead skin as far back as 100 BC, and likely before then. It has been used throughout many eras since then, including the Victorian Era. Today, many of these techniques are still used; pumice is widely used as a skin exfoliant. Even though hair removal techniques have evolved over the centuries, abrasive material like pumice stones is also still used. &quot;Pumice stones&quot; are often used in beauty salons during the pedicure process to remove dry and excess skin from the bottom of the foot as well as calluses. 

Finely ground pumice has been added to some toothpastes as a polish, similar to Roman use, and easily removes dental plaque build-up. Such toothpaste is too abrasive for daily use. Pumice is also added to heavy-duty hand cleaners (such as lava soap) as a mild abrasive. Some brands of chinchilla dust bath are formulated with powdered pumice. Old beauty techniques using pumice are still employed today but newer substitutes are easier to obtain.

=== Cleaning ===

Pumice stone, sometimes attached to a handle, is an effective scrubbing tool for removal of limescale, rust, hard water rings, and other stains on porcelain fixtures in households (e.g., bathrooms). It is a quick method compared to alternatives like chemicals or vinegar and baking soda or borax.

=== Horticulture ===
Good soil requires sufficient water and nutrient loading as well as little compaction to allow easy exchange of gases. The roots of plants require continuous transportation of carbon dioxide and oxygen to and from the surface. Pumice improves the quality of soil because of its porous properties; water and gases can be transported easily through the pores and nutrients can be stored in the microscopic holes. Pumice rock fragments are inorganic therefore no decomposition and little compaction occur. 

Another benefit of this inorganic rock is that it does not attract or host fungi or insects. As drainage is very important in horticulture, with the presence of pumice tillage is much easier. Pumice usage also creates ideal conditions for growing plants like cacti and succulents as it increases the water retention in sandy soils and reduces the density of clayey soils to allow more transportation of gases and water. The addition of pumice to soil improves and increases vegetative cover as the roots of plants make slopes more stable therefore it helps reduce erosion. It is often used on roadsides and ditches and commonly used in turf and golf courses to maintain grass cover and flatness that can degrade due to large amounts of traffic and compaction. Chemically pumice is pH neutral, neither acidic nor alkaline. In 2011, 16% of pumice mined in the United States was used for horticultural purposes.

Pumice contributes to soil fertility in areas where it is naturally present in the soil due to volcanic activity. For example, in the Jemez Mountains of New Mexico, the Ancestral Puebloans settled on &quot;pumice patches&quot; of the El Cajete Pumice which likely retained a greater amount of moisture and was ideal for farming.

===Construction===
Pumice is widely used to make lightweight concrete and insulative low-density cinder blocks. The air-filled vesicles in this porous rock serve as a good insulator. A fine-grained version of pumice called pozzolan is used as an additive in cement and is mixed with lime to form a light-weight, smooth, plaster-like concrete. This form of concrete was used as far back as Roman times. Roman engineers utilized it to build the huge dome of the Pantheon with increasing amounts of pumice added to concrete for higher elevations of the structure. It was also commonly used as a construction material for many aqueducts. 

One of the main uses of pumice currently in the United States is manufacturing concrete. This rock has been used in concrete mixtures for thousands of years and continues to be used in producing concrete, especially in regions close to where this volcanic material is deposited.

New studies prove a broader application of pumice powder in the concrete industry. Pumice can act as a cementitious material in concrete and researchers have shown that concrete made with up to 50% pumice powder can significantly improve durability yet reduce greenhouse gas emissions and fossil fuel consumption.

<text>The pommel horse is an artistic gymnastics apparatus. Traditionally, it is used by only male gymnasts. Originally made of a metal frame with a wooden body and a leather cover, the modern pommel horse has a metal body covered with foam rubber and leather, with plastic handles (or pommels).

== Apparatus ==

=== History ===
The apparatus originates from the Romans, who used wooden horses to teach mounting and dismounting. They later added it to the ancient Olympic Games. The basic modern exercises were developed in the early 19th century by Friedrich Ludwig Jahn, founder of the German Turnverein.

=== Dimensions ===
Measurements of the apparatus are published by the Fédération internationale de gymnastique (FIG) in the &quot;Apparatus Norms&quot; brochure.

* Height from top surface to floor: ± 
* Length at top: ± 
* Length at bottom: ± 
* Width at top: ± 
* Width at bottom: ± 
* Height of the pommels: ± 
* Distance between the pommels: – (adjustable)

== Routines ==
A typical pommel horse exercise involves both single-leg and double-leg workouts. Single-leg skills are generally in the form of scissors. Double leg workout, however, is the main staple of this event. The gymnast swings both legs in a circular motion (clockwise or counterclockwise, depending on preference) and performs such skills on all parts of the apparatus. To make the exercise more challenging, gymnasts will often include variations on a typical circling skill by turning (moores and spindles), straddling their legs (Flairs), placing one or both hands on the pommel or the leather, or moving up and down the horse placing their hands on the pommel or the leather (traveling). Routines end when the gymnast performs a dismount by swinging his body over the horse or going through a handstand to land on the mat. The pommel horse, its gymnastic elements, and various rules are all regulated by the Code of Points.

Pommel horse is considered one of the more difficult men&#x27;s events. While it is well noted that all events require a particular build of muscle and technique, pommel horse tends to favor technique over muscle. This is because horse routines are done from the shoulders in a leaning motion, and no moves need to be held, unlike other events. Therefore, stress induced in one&#x27;s arms is reduced, meaning less muscle is required for this event than in events like still rings or parallel bars.

=== International level routines ===
A pommel horse routine should contain at least one element from all element groups:

* Single leg swings and scissors
* Circles and flairs, with or without spindles and handstands
* Side and cross-support travels
* Dismounts

=== Scoring and rules ===
Form is crucial to any successful routine, as with all events in the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique guidelines. For pommel horse, form consists of keeping one&#x27;s feet pointed and legs straight during the entire routine. The gymnast should keep his legs together during all elements except for scissors, single-legged elements, and flairs, where the degree and control of separation are considered important. Points are also deducted for not using all three sections of the horse and pausing or stopping on the apparatus. Deductions also apply for brushing and hitting the apparatus.

==Olympic pommel horse medalists==
The most decorated and successful Olympic pommel worker in history is Great Britain&#x27;s Max Whitlock, with three medals, including two gold medals. Two other gymnasts have three pommel horse Olympic medals across three Games: Romania&#x27;s Marius Urzică with one gold and two silver medals, and Whitlock&#x27;s compatriot and teammate Louis Smith with two silvers, and a bronze—under historic rules Smith would have shared gold in 2012, but was awarded silver behind Kristian Berki after a tie was broken on execution score. 

Three other pommel workers have two Olympic gold medals, each considered a legend of the sport: the Soviet Union gymnast Boris Shakhlin, the Yugoslav Miroslav Cerar, and the Hungarian master, Zoltán Magyar.

==Pommel horse medalists at the world championships==

The pommel horse has been contested at the World Artistic Gymnastics Championships since their inauguration. The record for most world victories is held by several workers at three. Three of the four double Olympic champions, Miroslav Cerar, Zoltan Magyar, and Max Whitlock have each won the world title three times, to set the record for combined global titles at five. The most decorated workers at the World Championships are Whitlock and two one-time Olympic champions, Xiao Qin of China, and Hungary&#x27;s Kristian Berki, all with three gold and two silver medals. Although Xiao and Berki each have won one Olympic gold, they are both considered to be among the major figures in the event&#x27;s history along with the double Olympic champions.

Overall, Whitlock is the most successful and decorated pommel worker in the event&#x27;s history, with five global gold medals, two silvers, and a bronze.

<text>The rings, also known as still rings (in contrast to flying rings), is an artistic gymnastics apparatus and the event that uses it. It is traditionally used only by male gymnasts due to its extreme upper body strength requirements. Gymnasts often wear ring grips while performing.

== The apparatus ==
The apparatus consists of two rings that hang freely from a rigid metal frame. Each ring is supported by a strap, which connects to a steel cable suspended from the metal frame. The gymnast, who grips one ring with each hand, must control the movement of the rings and their body movements at all times.

=== Dimensions ===
The measurements of the standard apparatus are specified by Fédération internationale de gymnastique (FIG) in its &quot;Apparatus Norms&quot; document:

* Inner diameter: ± 
* Diameter of profile: ± 
* Distance from the point of attachment to the lower inner side of the rings: ± 
* Distance between two points of attachment: ± 

== Routines ==
An exercise on rings consists of swing, strength, and hold elements. Generally, gymnasts are required to fulfill various requirements, including a swing to hold handstand, a static strength hold, and an aerial dismount. More experienced gymnasts often perform more than one strength element, sometimes swinging into hold positions or performing different holds consecutively.

One of the most widely recognized skills performed on the rings is the &quot;Iron Cross&quot;, which is executed by extending both arms straight out from the sides of the body while suspended mid-air for at least two seconds. Other common strength moves include the inverted cross (i.e., vertically inverted Iron Cross) and the Maltese cross, in which the gymnast holds their body parallel to the ground at ring height with arms extended laterally. Swing elements include giant swings from handstand to handstand, in both front and back directions, similar to giants performed on the horizontal bar. Elements on the rings are regulated by the Code of Points.

=== International level routines ===
A rings routine should contain at least one element from all element groups:
* I. Kip and swing elements &amp; swings through or to handstand
* II. Strength elements and hold elements
* III. Swings to strength hold elements
* IV. Dismounts

=== Scoring and rules ===
Gymnasts will take deductions for form similar to other apparatus. On rings, gymnasts will also take deductions for having bent arms while performing nearly all elements or using the straps/cables to support or balance themselves. Additional deductions are applied to gymnasts unable to maintain a neutral head position during holds, a neutral face (not grimacing), or grunting. There are also deductions for each extraneous swinging of the cables during the routine. Bonus points on the still rings are earned by performing consecutive distinct static hold elements based upon the letter value of both moves, listed in the code of points.

<text>The Cheyenne Mountain Complex is a United States Space Force installation and defensive bunker located in unincorporated El Paso County, Colorado, next to the city of Colorado Springs, at the Cheyenne Mountain Space Force Station, which hosts the activities of several tenant units. Also located in Colorado Springs is Peterson Space Force Base, where the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) headquarters are located.

Formerly the center for the United States Space Command (USSC) and NORAD, the Complex monitored the airspace of Canada and the United States for missiles, space systems, and foreign aircraft through its worldwide early-warning system. Since 2008, NORAD and the USSC have been based at Peterson Space Force Base and the complex, re-designated as an Air Force station, is used for crew training and as a back-up command center if required.

The military complex has included, in the past, many units of NORAD, USSC, Aerospace Defense Command (ADCOM), Air Force Systems Command, Air Weather Service, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The complex&#x27;s communication center is also used by the nearby U.S. Civil Defense Warning Center.

== Facilities ==

=== Main chambers ===

The complex was built under 2,000 feet (610 metres) of granite on five acres (2 hectares). Fifteen three-story buildings are protected from movement, e.g., earthquake or explosion, by a system of giant springs that the buildings sit on and flexible pipe connectors to limit the operational effect of movement. A total of more than 1,000 springs are designed to prevent any of the 15 buildings from shifting more than one inch. The complex is the only underground Department of Defense facility certified to be able to sustain a high-altitude electromagnetic pulse (EMP). There are a large quantity of cots for most of the personnel, including suites for high-ranking officers within the bunker. Amenities include a medical facility, store, cafeteria, and fitness centers inside and outside the mountain.

=== Blast doors ===

The bunker is built to deflect a 30 megaton nuclear explosion as close as 1.2 miles (1.9 km). Within a mountain tunnel are sets of 25-ton blast doors and another for the civil engineering department. The doors were built so that they can always be opened when needed. Should a nuclear blast hit the building, they are designed to withstand a blast wave. There is a network of blast valves with unique filters to capture airborne chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear contaminants.

=== Outdoor ===

Outside of the military complex are the parking lots, a fire station, and outdoor recreational facilities. The recreational amenities include Mountain Man Park, picnic areas, a racquetball facility, softball field, sand volleyball court, basketball court, a putting green, and horseshoe area.

=== Support area ===
The complex has its own power plant, heating and cooling system, and water supply. The 21st Mission Support Group ensures there is a 99.999% degree of reliability of its electricity, water, air conditioning, power, and other support systems. The threats, in descending order of likelihood, that the complex may face are &quot;medical emergencies, natural disasters, civil disorder, a conventional attack, an electromagnetic pulse attack, a cyber or information attack, chemical or biological or radiological attack, an improvised nuclear attack, a limited nuclear attack, [and] a general nuclear attack.&quot; The least likely events are the most hazardous.

There is more water produced by mountain springs than the base requires, and a 1,500,000-gallon (5,700,000-litre) reservoir ensures that even in event of fire, there is enough water to meet the facility&#x27;s needs. A reservoir of 4,500,000 gallons (17,000,000 litres) of water is used as a heat sink. There is a &quot;massive&quot; reservoir for diesel fuel and a &quot;huge&quot; battery bank with redundant power generators.

== History ==

=== Construction and systems installation ===

The North American Air Defense Command (NORAD) was established and activated at the Ent Air Force Base on September 12, 1957. The Command is a binational organization of Canadian (1 Canadian Air Division) and United States air defense command units, in accordance with NORAD Agreements first made on May 12, 1958. In the late 1950s, a plan was developed to construct a command and control center in a hardened facility as a Cold War defensive strategy against long-range Soviet bombers, ballistic missiles, and a nuclear attack.

In 1957, the Strategic Air Command began construction in New England inside Bare Mountain for a hardened bunker to contain the command post for the 8th Air Force, which was located at nearby Westover Air Force Base, Chicopee, Massachusetts. This underground facility was nicknamed &quot;The Notch&quot; (or formally as the 8th AF &quot;Post-Attack Command and Control System Facility, Hadley&quot;) and was hardened to protect it from the effects of a nearby nuclear blast and designed so that the senior military staff could facilitate further military operations. Four years later, construction at Cheyenne Mountain was started to create a similar protection for the NORAD command post. Cheyenne Mountain was excavated under the supervision of the Army Corps of Engineers for the construction of the NORAD Combat Operations Center beginning on May 18, 1961, by Utah Construction &amp; Mining Company.

The Space Defense Center and the Combat Operations Center achieved full operational capability on February 6, 1967. The total cost was $142.4 million. Its systems included a command-and-control system developed by Burroughs Corporation. The electronics and communications system centralized and automated the instantaneous (one-millionth of a second) evaluation of aerospace surveillance data. The Space Defense Center moved from Ent AFB to the complex in 1965. The NORAD Combat Operations Center was fully operational April 20, 1966 and The Space Defense Command&#x27;s 1st Aerospace Control Squadron moved to Cheyenne Mountain that month. The following systems or commands became operational between May and October, 1966: The NORAD Attack Warning System, Combat Operations Command, and Delta I computer system, which recorded and monitored every detected space system. By January 4, 1967, the National Civil Defense Warning Center was in the bunker.

=== Operations and improvements ===

==== Air Defense Command satellite systems ====
System Development Corporation updated Air Defense Command satellite information processing systems for $15,850,542 on January 19, 1973. The improvements were primarily to the Space Computational Center&#x27;s displays and application software, which was updated to provide real-time positioning of orbiting space systems for the NORAD Combat Operation Center. The first phase, which established a system integrator and modernized the communications to a major data processing system, was completed in October 1972.

==== Ballistic Missile Defense Center ====
The Ballistic Missile Defense Center (BMDC) BW 1.2 release was installed in February 1974 in the Combat Operations Center, under the command of CONAD. The Safeguard command and control system, operated by the commander, communicated warnings, observation data, and attack assessment to the Combat Operations Center. It was also designed to release nuclear weapons.

==== Combat Operations Center ====
By 1978, five operating centers and a command post resided within the NORAD Combat Operations Center. The Space Computational Center catalogued and tracked space objects. The Intelligence Center analyzed intelligence data. Data was consolidated and displayed in the Command Post by the System Center. The Weather Support Unit monitored local and global weather patterns. The NORAD Commander&#x27;s wartime staff reported to the Battle Staff Support Center.

==== Space Defense Operations Center ====
The Space Defense Operations Center (SPADOC), established on October 1, 1979, consolidated United States Air Force satellite survivability, space surveillance, and US ASAT operations into one wartime space activities hub at the NORAD Cheyenne Mountain Complex. Space surveillance and missile warning functions were performed by the Core Processing Segment (CPS) using Worldwide Military Command and Control System&#x27;s Honeywell H6080 computers at the SPADOC Computational Center (SCC) and NORAD Computer System (NCS). A third computer was operational backup for SCC or NCS. By 1981, the H6080 failed to meet the requirements for timely computations. SPADATS was deactivated about 1980, although some of its logic continued on in SPADOC systems.

==== Cheyenne Mountain Complex Improvements Program (427M) ====
NORAD had a series of warning and assessment systems that were not fully automated in the Cheyenne Mountain complex into the 1970s. In 1979, the Cheyenne Mountain Complex Improvements Program 427M system became fully operational. It was a consolidated Cheyenne Mountain Upgrade program for command center, space, ballistic missile, and space functions, developed using new software technology and designed for computers with large processing capacity. There were three major segments of the 427M system: the Communication System Segment (CSS), NORAD Computer System (NCS), and Space Computational Center (SCC). The 425L Command and Control System, Display Information Processor, Command Center Processing System, and other hardware were replaced by the NORAD Computer System (NCS). The new system was designed to centralize several databases, improve on-line display capabilities, and consolidate mission warning information processing and transmission. It was intended to have greater reliability and quicker early warning capability. The Command Center Processing System&#x27;s original UNIVAC 1106, re-purposed for Mission Essential Back-up Capability (MEBU), was upgraded to the more robust UNIVAC 1100/42. The 427M system, intended to modernize systems and improve performance, was initially &quot;wholly ineffective&quot; and resulted in several failures of the Worldwide Military Command and Control System (WWMCCS) system.

In 1979 and 1980, there were a few instances when false missile warnings were generated by the Cheyenne Mountain complex systems. For instance, a computer chip &quot;went haywire&quot; and issued false missile warnings, which raised the possibility that a nuclear war could be started accidentally, based upon incorrect data. Staff analyzed the data and found that the warnings were erroneous, and the systems were updated to identify false alarms. Gen. James V. Hartinger of the Air Force stated that &quot;his primary responsibility is to provide Washington with what he calls &#x27;timely, unambiguous, reliable warning&#x27; that a raid on North America has begun.&quot; He explained that there are about 6,700 messages generated on average each hour in 1979 and 1980 and all had been processed without error. An off-site testing facility was established in Colorado Springs by NORAD in late 1979 or early 1980 so that system changes could be tested off-line before they were moved into production. Following another failure in 1980, a bad computer chip was updated, and staff and commander processes were improved to better respond to warnings.

The Cheyenne Mountain Upgrade (CMU) of November 1988, designed to consolidate five improvement programs, was not installed because it was not compatible with other systems at Cheyenne Mountain and it did not meet the defined specifications according to deficiencies identified during testing. The five improvement programs were the CCPDS Replacement (CCPDS-R), CSS Replacement (CSS-R), Granite Sentry upgrade, SCIS, and SPADOC 4. SPADOC 4 was for upgrading the SCC with primary and backup 3090-200J mainframes), and SPADOC 4 block A achieved initial operating capability (IOC) in April 1989. The CSS-R &quot;first element&quot; achieved IOC on April 12, 1991; and the 427M system was replaced . The CSSR, SCIS, Granite Sentry, CCPDS-R, and their interfaces were tested in 1997. Testing of Granite Sentry nuclear detonation (NUDET) data processing system found it to be inadequate.

==== Joint Surveillance System ====
The Joint Surveillance System (JSS), developed under an agreement with the Canadian government, became fully operational in seven Region Operations Control Centers (ROCCs) on December 23, 1983. The Joint Surveillance System was implemented to replace Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE).

==== Survivable Communications Integration System ====
In 1986, Congress approved development of the Survivable Communications Integration System (SCIS) to communicate missile warning messages simultaneously over many forms of media, but it was subject to delays and cost overruns. By 1992, the project was estimated to be delayed to 1995 and cost projected to increase from $142 million to $234 million.

==== Other systems ====
By 1992, the U.S. Space Command Space Surveillance Center (SSC) was the data analysis and tracking center for Baker-Nunn camera images and Cheyenne Mountain was connected to the AN/URC-117 Ground Wave Emergency Network (GWEN) communication site in Pueblo, Colorado. By 1995, the AN/FPS-129 HAVE STARE (Globus II) radar in California had been upgraded to &quot;relay data to Cheyenne Mountain&quot;, and by October 1995 the 1st Command and Control Squadron (1CACS) in the bunker was providing space collision avoidance data to the Cheyenne Mountain Operations Center&#x27;s space control center.

In June 1993, the Cheyenne Mountain Complex Operations Center had the USSPACE and NORAD Command Center, NORAD Air Defense Operations Center (ADOC), NORAD/USSPACECOM Combined Intelligence Watch Center (CIWC), USSPACECOM Space Defense Operations Center (SPADOC), USSPACECOM Space Surveillance Center (SSC), AFSPACECOM Weather Operations Center, and the AFSPACECOM Systems Center within its facility.

Plans to house the USSPACECOM and NORAD command centers in the same location began by July 1994. A $450 million upgrade was made to the missile warning center beginning in February 1995. The effort was part of a $1.7 billion renovation program for Cheyenne Mountain.

&#x27;Granite Sentry&#x27; was an improvement program for the complex. It aimed &quot;to provide a Message Processing Subsystem and a Video Distribution Subsystem, and [to upgrade] the NORAD Computer System display capability and four major centers: (1) the Air Defense Operations Center, (2) the NORAD Command Center, (3) the Battle Staff Support Center, and (4) the Weather Support Unit.&quot; It was also to process and display &quot;nuclear detection data provided from the Integrated Correlation and Display System.&quot; For $230 million the program was also to &quot;replace display screens of the Attack Warning and Attack Assessment System.&quot; It was delayed from 1993 to 1996. 

Granite Sentry and other Cheyenne Mountain Upgrade interfaces were tested in 1997, and Granite Sentry&#x27;s processing regarding &quot;simulated [nuclear] detonation messages…injected into the Defense Support Program Data Distribution Center [was] not adequate...&quot;.
The Combatant Commander&#x27;s Integrated Command and Control System (CCIC2S) program began in 2000 with a Lockheed Martin contract &quot;to upgrade all of the mission systems within Cheyenne Mountain, which included the space surveillance systems&quot; for delivery in 2006. The portion of CCIC2S modernizing &quot;attack warning systems within Cheyenne Mountain [was to] cost more than $700 million from fiscal years 2000 to 2006&quot;, and the delayed CCIC2S upgrades for space surveillance were superseded by systems for the Joint Space Operations Center&#x27;s Space C2 program and Integrated Space Situational Awareness program.

By 2003, consoles for the Ground-Based Mid-Course Defense (GMD) had been contracted for Cheyenne Mountain, and the planned 18 month Cheyenne Mountain Realignment to move Command Center operations to Peterson AFB was complete by May 13, 2008. On August 3, 2011, a ribbon cutting was held for the January 2010 – June 30, 2011, Missile Warning Center renovation funded by USSTRATCOM.

Over the years, the installation came to house elements of the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), U.S. Strategic Command, U.S. Air Force Space Command and U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM). Under what became known as the Cheyenne Mountain Operations Center (CMOC), several centers supported the NORAD missions of aerospace warning and aerospace control and provided warning of ballistic missile or air attacks against North America.

=== Peterson and Vandenberg Air Force Bases ===
On July 28, 2006, the Cheyenne Mountain Directorate was re-designated as the Cheyenne Mountain Division, with the mission to assist in establishing an integrated NORAD and USNORTHCOM Command Center within the headquarters building at Peterson Air Force Base. The Unified Space Vault and the Space Control Center were moved from Cheyenne Mountain to the Joint Space Operations Center at Vandenberg Air Force Base about October 2007.

In 2006, NORAD relocated to a basement in the Peterson No. 2 building at the nearby Peterson AFB. Northern Command and Space Command and Canadian military defense partners relocated at Peterson. The Cheyenne Mountain complex is maintained by a skeleton crew and no longer operates on a 24/7 basis. The complex is on &quot;warm standby&quot;, meaning it is only staffed when required.

On the fiftieth anniversary of the NORAD agreement—May 12, 2008—the Command Center located within Cheyenne Mountain Complex was officially re-designated as the NORAD and USNORTHCOM Alternate Command Center. The Cheyenne Mountain Division of NORAD and USNORTHCOM was re-designated as the J36 branch within the NORAD and USNORTHCOM&#x27;s Operations Directorates.

=== NORAD Alternate Command ===
Since 2002, the complex has been classed as Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station and has been used in crew qualification training, while the former command function has been redesignated as the &quot;NORAD and USNORTHCOM Alternate Command Center&quot; since 2008 after all the original functions of the complex were removed to Peterson Air Force Base. The complex is maintained by the 21st Mission Support Group which provides support and maintenance for the &#x27;NORAD/USNORTHCOM&#x27;s training, exercise and alternate command center functions, U.S. Strategic Command&#x27;s Missile Warning Center, Detachment 2 of the 17th Test Squadron, Air Force Technical Applications Center&#x27;s research laboratory, the Defense Intelligence Agency&#x27;s Western Continental United States Regional Service Center&#x27;.

Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station is owned and operated by Air Force Space Command. NORAD and USNORTHCOM now use just under 30% of the floor space within the complex and comprise approximately 5% of the daily population at Cheyenne Mountain. The Cheyenne Mountain Complex serves as NORAD and USNORTHCOM&#x27;s Alternate Command Center and as a training site for crew qualification. Day-to-day crew operations for NORAD and USNORTHCOM typically take place at Peterson Air Force Base.

=== Migration of NORAD communications to Cheyenne Mountain ===
In early 2015, Admiral William E. Gortney, commander of NORAD and NORTHCOM, announced a $700 million contract with Raytheon to move systems into the complex to shield it from electromagnetic pulse attack, with additional work to be done at Vandenberg and Offutt. According to Gortney, &quot;because of the very nature of the way that Cheyenne Mountain&#x27;s built, it&#x27;s EMP-hardened. And so, there&#x27;s a lot of movement to put capability into Cheyenne Mountain and to be able to communicate in there&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFP/Defense News&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Units ==
Electronic Systems Division Detachment 10 at Ent AFB became the Cheyenne Mountain Complex Management Office (CMCMO) in 1963, the year the Chidlaw Combined Operations Center began operations; and on February 15, 1980, ESD Detachment 2 was established at the &quot;Cheyenne Mountain Complex&quot; (Det 2 became the AFSC focal point during the Cheyenne Mountain Upgrade.) Aerospace Defense Command organizations in the bunker became a specified command when the major command ended in 1980; e.g., the J31 unit of HQ NORAD/ADCOM subsequently staffed the Space Surveillance Center in the same room as the Missile Warning Center (separated by partitions). The &quot;HQ Cheyenne Mountain Support Group ... was activated at the Cheyenne Mountain Complex&quot; in October 1981 to support the Aerospace Defense Center&#x27;s operation of the NORAD combat operations center&quot;. In 1983 the Foreign Technology Division had an operating location at the bunker and in 1992, an airman of the &quot;1010th Civil Engineering Squadron at Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Base&quot; developed a 3-D AutoCAD model of the bunker &quot;to zoom in on a specific room&quot;.

By 1995 a &quot;missile operations section&quot; supported the missile warning center, and in 2001 the 1989 1CACS at the Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station was renamed the 1st Space Control Squadron. On June 24, 1994, when the &quot;Joint Task Force – Cheyenne Mountain Operations organization was brought online to take responsibility for the installation&quot;, Brig. Gen. Donald Peterson was the commander of the JTF, which was renamed the &quot;U.S. Space Command Cheyenne Mountain operations center&quot; by March 1995. On July 28, 2006, the Cheyenne Mountain Realignment redesignated the Cheyenne Mountain Directorate to the Cheyenne Mountain Division. Circa 2004 the bunker included the 17th Test Squadron&#x27;s Detachment 2 and AFTAC&#x27;s research laboratory, in 2008 Detachment 1 of the 392d Training Squadron operated the Cheyenne Mountain Training System (CMTS), and in 2011 the installation&#x27;s 721st SFS was expanded.

<text>Grafeneck is a small rural village in the German municipality of Gomadingen, south of Stuttgart.

==World War II history==

Grafeneck Castle, which had previously been an asylum for crippled people, was turned by the Nazis into an extermination facility.

Between January and December 1940, 10,654 people with mental disabilities or psychological disorders were gassed at this facility with carbon monoxide in the first gas chamber and then cremated. This was the beginning of the T-4 Euthanasia Program. Grafeneck was the first Nazi institution to be transformed in a gas chamber and crematorium.

<doc id="230373" wikidata="Q692104" url="?curid=230373" title="Parallel bars">
<text>Parallel bars are floor apparatus consisting of two wooden bars approximately 350cm (11&#x27;6&quot;) long and positioned at 200 centimetres (6.6 ft) above the floor. Parallel bars are used in artistic gymnastics and also for physical therapy and home exercise. Gymnasts may optionally wear grips when performing a routine on the parallel bars, although this is uncommon.

== Apparatus ==
The apparatus consists of two parallel bars that are held parallel to, and elevated above, the floor by a metal supporting framework. The bars are composed of wood or other material, with an outer wood coating. The vertical members of the supporting framework are adjustable so the height of the bars above the floor and distance between the bars can be set optimally for each gymnast.

=== Dimensions ===
*Bar length: ± 
*Bar rounded profile: ± vertical by ± horizontal 
*Height of bar from floor: ± 
*Distance between bars: – (adjustable)

==History==
The parallel bars (in German &quot;Barren&quot;) were invented by Friedrich Ludwig Jahn in Berlin. In 1819 the first transportable parallel bars were described. In 1856, Hermann Otto Kluge used tubes to adjust the parallel and horizontal bars in Germany. He used them in his gym. In Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;Anna Karenina&quot;, published between 1873 and 1877, their use for exercise is mentioned.

== Routines ==
A routine performed on the parallel bars must include various elements that depend on the gymnast&#x27;s competitive level. A typical performance will involve swinging skills in a support position (on the hands), a hanging position, and an upper arm position (resting on the inner bicep). Also, parallel bar routines often feature a strength or static hold skill such as an L-sit or handstand. Each routine ends with a dismount from either the bars&#x27; ends or the apparatus&#x27;s side.

=== International level routines ===
A parallel bar routine should contain at least one element from all element groups:
* I. Elements in support or through support
* II. Elements starting in the upper arm position
* III. Long swings in hang, on 1 or 2 bars, and Underswings
* IV. Dismounts

=== Scoring and rules ===
Deductions are taken for lack of form and precision of elements performed. There are specific deductions for adjusting the hand position in the handstand and not controlling swing elements; swing type elements should momentarily show handstand.

<doc id="230374" wikidata="Q3853498" url="?curid=230374" title="Brownlow Medal">
<text>The Charles Brownlow Trophy, better known as the Brownlow Medal (and informally as Charlie), is awarded to the best and fairest player in the Australian Football League (AFL) during the home-and-away season, as determined by votes cast by the four officiating field umpires after each game. It is the most prestigious award for individual players in the AFL. It is also widely acknowledged as the highest individual honour in the sport of Australian rules football.

The medal was first awarded by the Victorian Football League (VFL). It was created and named in honour of Charles Brownlow, a former Geelong Football Club footballer (1880–1891) and club secretary (1885–1923), and VFL president (1918–19), who had died in January 1924 after an extended illness.

==Fairest and best==

Although the award is generally spoken of the &quot;best and fairest&quot;, the award&#x27;s specific criterion is &quot;fairest and best&quot;, reflecting an emphasis on sportsmanship and fair play (this also explains the decision to have the votes cast by the umpires), as the 1924 illuminated facsimile expressly states:

The VFL was the last of the three elite leagues to strike an award for league best and fairest, with the SANFL&#x27;s Magarey Medal being first awarded in 1898, and the WAFL&#x27;s Sandover Medal first being awarded since 1921. Over time, all three awards have migrated towards similar rules regarding voting and eligibility. 

Excluding the change of the monogram from VFL to AFL in 1990, the design, shape and size of the medallion have been virtually unchanged since 1924.

==Criteria for &quot;fairest&quot; and &quot;best&quot;==
===Voting procedure for &quot;best&quot;===
To determine the &quot;best&quot; player, the four field umpires (not the goal umpires or boundary umpires) confer after each home-and-away match and award 3 votes, 2 votes and 1 vote to the players they regard as the best, second best and third best in the match respectively. On the awards night, the votes from each match are tallied, and the player(s) with the highest number of votes is awarded the medal (subject to eligibility – see below).

The current voting system has been used for the vast majority of Brownlow Medal counts. There have been different voting systems for short periods in the past:
* until 1930, only one vote was cast in each game. This was changed to the current 3–2–1 system after the 1930 season saw three players tied on four votes apiece;
* in 1976, the VFL introduced a second field umpire, and both umpires individually awarded 3–2–1 votes; this voting system was abandoned in 1978, and the two (and later, three and then four) umpires conferred to give a single set of 3–2–1 votes.

Since the rules were changed after the 1980 season, if two or more eligible players score the equal highest number of votes, each wins a Brownlow medal. Up to 1980, if two or more players were tied, a single winner was chosen on a countback:
* under the initial rules until 1930, the umpiring panel would be called to meet and agree upon a winner among the tied players
* added to the rules at some stage prior to 1930 (but without removing the previous stipulation – causing confusion in the tied 1930 count), the winner was the player who had the highest percentage of votes polled vs games played;
* after 1930, the winner was the player who had the most 3-vote games; then, if still tied, the most 2-vote games.

Even with these considerations, these countbacks failed to separate Des Fothergill and Herbie Matthews, who tied for the medal in 1940. The league decided to keep the original medal and award replica medals to the two winners. In 1989, the eight players who since the inception of the award had tied on votes but lost on a countback were awarded retrospective medals.

===Ineligibility===
The &quot;fairest&quot; component of the medal is achieved by making ineligible any player who is suspended by the AFL Tribunal during the home-and-away season. An ineligible player cannot win the Brownlow Medal, regardless of the number of votes he has received.

A player remains eligible for the Brownlow Medal under the following circumstances:
* if he is suspended during the finals or pre-season;
* if he serves a suspension in the current season which was earned for an offence committed in the previous season;
* he receives any sort of club-imposed suspension which is not recognised by the AFL Tribunal;
* if he is found guilty by the AFL Tribunal of an offence which attracts only a financial penalty.

The application of the ineligibility criteria has remained fairly consistent throughout the history of the award, with some subtle changes, since it was introduced in 1931. The main exception was from 2005 until 2014, when a player would become ineligible if he committed an infringement that the Tribunal&#x27;s Match Review Panel judged as being worthy of a one-game suspension, before applying adjustments based on a player&#x27;s good or bad record, or for accepting an early guilty plea – meaning that players with a good record or early plea could be ineligible despite avoiding suspension, or a player with a bad record could be eligible despite having been suspended.

Umpires cast their votes for each game independent of eligibility criteria of the players; &quot;i.e.&quot; umpires can cast votes for players who have already been suspended during that season if they perceive them to be amongst the best on the ground. Prior to 1991, votes could not be awarded to a player in a match in which he was reported, but this rule was eliminated in 1991 so that a player would not be disadvantaged if he would have gained votes in a match in which he was reported but later cleared by the tribunal.

On three occasions, an ineligible player has tallied the highest number of Brownlow votes:
* In 1996, Corey McKernan received the same number of votes as the joint-winners James Hird and Michael Voss. McKernan was suspended for one match during the season for kneeing. McKernan was named the AFL Players Association MVP in the same year, which is not subject to the same eligibility criteria.
* In 1997, Chris Grant polled one more vote than winner Robert Harvey. Grant was suspended for one match during the season for striking.
* In 2012, Jobe Watson was originally declared the winner by polling four more votes than runners up Trent Cotchin and Sam Mitchell, however in November 2016, he was retrospectively deemed ineligible for the award, due to his part in the Essendon Football Club supplements saga, and the title was given to Cotchin and Mitchell.

==Criticism==
The voting system has come under scrutiny because the medal is almost always won by midfield players, with relatively few key-position players ever winning. Some of the game&#x27;s greatest players in these positions never even came close to winning the Brownlow despite having high reputations amongst their peers and coaches. This is primarily because players who are most valuable to their teams in key or defensive positions tend not to attract enough attention to feature amongst the top three players on the ground. It is also perceived that umpires may not be best suited to judging the quality of gameplay. This view has existed for a very long time, appearing in opinion columns even as early as the 1930s. Several prominent coaches, including Kevin Sheedy and Leigh Matthews, have publicly criticised the voting process.

The eligibility system has also come under criticism. The argument has been made that many offences worthy only of a one-match suspension are caused by negligent play, rather than intentionally unfair play, and hence that suspension is not a reasonable measure of fairness. The temporary break from tradition under the demerit points-based tribunal system (which saw player being ineligible despite not having served suspensions) was also criticised as confusing. Prominent players, including dual-winner Chris Judd, have indicated a desire to have the eligibility criterion removed from the award (effectively eliminating the &quot;fairest&quot; component altogether); but this view is not universally held, and 1958 winner Neil Roberts stated in 1988 that he would hand back his medal if the fairness criterion were removed.

==Award ceremony==

Over the years, the award ceremony has become increasingly elaborate, with footballers and their dates gradually becoming more fashion-conscious. This aspect of the night has become widely reported by gossip columns, with the red carpet arrival often humorously referred to as the &#x27;Gownlow&#x27;. The ceremony is currently held at Crown Melbourne on the Monday five days prior to the AFL Grand Final. Only three times since the award&#x27;s inception in 1924 has the count been held outside of Melbourne: when it was held in Sydney in 1999, and in 2020 and 2021 when the event was held virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic preventing the event from being held in Melbourne. In years past, prospective Grand Final players have attended the ceremony in person, but in recent years non-Victorian Grand Final teams have declined to attend the ceremony due to the inconvenience of travel in such an important week; a live video link to Brownlow functions in their home city is done instead.

The event itself consists of the votes for each match being read out in succession by the CEO of the AFL, interspersed with a retrospective look at highlights from each round of the season and commentary from the broadcast network&#x27;s usual football commentary team.

The integrity of the award is upheld by the tight security and secrecy surrounding the votes. Once the umpires make their decision, the votes are locked away and transported by armoured security vehicles. No one except the three umpires knows exactly who has been voted for, and as different umpires vote on different games, no one can be sure of who will win. Unlike most award ceremonies, the votes are not tallied or even opened until they are actually announced on the night, so the drama is maintained until late on the actual night, when the result sometimes comes down to the final round of votes.

From 1959 until 1974 radio stations including 3UZ, 3KZ and 3AW broadcast the vote counts. 1116 SEN now covers the count. Direct television telecasts began in 1970, when the venue was the Dallas Brooks Hall, and have occurred every year since.

Some bookmakers offer bets on the winner of the Brownlow Medal. A number of well-publicised plunges on the betting odds of supposed winners has led to increasingly elaborate security measures to ensure the Brownlow votes are kept secret until the vote count.

Since 1987, the theme used in the moments after the winning player has been announced is the end credits theme from &quot;The Untouchables&quot;.

==Changi Brownlow Medal==
During World War II, there was an Australian rules football competition amongst the prisoners of war held at Singapore&#x27;s Changi prison. There were four teams named &quot;Geelong&quot;, &quot;Essendon&quot;, &quot;Collingwood&quot; and &quot;Carlton&quot;. The standard was reportedly high, with some of the players having appeared in the major league in Australia. At the end of the final season in 1943, Corporal Peter Chitty won a makeshift award known as the &quot;Changi Brownlow&quot;, which his family later donated to the Australian War Memorial. It is variously claimed the medal was originally a piece of an aircraft wing or part of a kitchen utensil. The War Memorial states that it may have been an old soccer medallion found in stores and refashioned and engraved. The presentation was made by former Brownlow Medallist Wilfred Smallhorn, who was too ill to play.

<text>Viking Line Abp is a Finnish shipping company that operates a fleet of ferries and cruiseferries between Finland, the Åland Islands, Sweden and Estonia. Viking Line shares are quoted on the Helsinki Stock Exchange. Viking Line is operated from Åland.

== Company history ==
=== Early years: 1959–1966 ===
Viking Line&#x27;s history can be traced back to 1959, when a group of sea- and businessmen from the Åland Islands province in Finland formed Rederi Ab Vikinglinjen, purchased a steam-powered car-ferry SS &quot;Dinard&quot; from the UK, renamed her and began service on the route Korpo (Finland)–Mariehamn (Åland)–Gräddö (Sweden). In the same year the Gotland-based Rederi AB Slite began a service between Simpnäs (Sweden) and Mariehamn.

In 1962, a disagreement caused a group of people to leave Rederi Ab Vikinglinjen and form a new company, Rederi Ab Ålandsfärjan, who began a service linking Gräddö and Mariehamn the following year.

Soon the three companies, all competing for passengers between Åland Islands and Sweden, realised that they in the long run all stood to lose from mutual competition. In 1965 Vikinglinjen and Slite began collaborating, and in the end of July 1966 Viking Line was established as a marketing company for all three companies. At this time Rederi Ab Vikinglinjen changed their name to Rederi Ab Solstad, in order to avoid confusion with the marketing company. The red hull livery was adopted from Slite&#x27;s Ålandspilen service (to which it had been taken from the colour of the chairman&#x27;s wife&#x27;s lipstick!). In 1967 Rederi Ab Ålandsfärjan changed its name to SF Line and in 1977 Rederi Ab Solstad was merged into its mother company Rederi Ab Sally.

=== 1967–1985 ===
Because Viking Line was only a marketing company, each owner company retained their individual fleets and could choose on which routes to set their ships (naturally there was also co-ordination on schedules and such). Each company&#x27;s ships were easy to distinguish by name: all Sally ships had a &quot;Viking&quot; prefix on their names, Slite took their names from Roman and Greek mythologies, while SF Line&#x27;s names ended with -ella in honor of managing director Gunnar Eklund&#x27;s wife Ellen Eklund.

During the 1970s Viking expanded greatly and overtook Silja Line as the largest shipping consortium on the Northern Baltic Sea. Between 1970 and 1973 Slite and Sally took delivery of five nearly identical ships built at Meyer Werft Germany, namely MS &quot;Apollo&quot; and MS &quot;Diana&quot; for Slite, and MS &quot;Viking 1&quot;, MS &quot;Viking 3&quot; and MS &quot;Viking 4&quot; for Sally. MS &quot;Viking 5&quot;, delivered in 1974, was an enlargened version of the same design. These so-called Papenburg sisters can be considered to be one of the most successful ships designs of all times (the shipyard built three additional sisters of the original design for Transbordadores for ship services in Mexico: &quot;Coromuel&quot;, &quot;Puerto Vallarta&quot; and &quot;Azteca&quot;). In 1973 Viking Line started service on the Turku–Mariehamn–Stockholm route, directly competing with Silja Line for the first time. The next year Sally began Viking Line traffic between Helsinki and Stockholm. For the next decade this route stayed in their hands, whereas on other routes the three companies operated together.

By the latter half of the 1970s, Sally was clearly the dominant partner in the consortium. In 1980 they took delivery of three new ferries (MS &quot;Viking Saga&quot;, MS &quot;Viking Sally&quot; and MS &quot;Viking Song&quot;), largest to have sailed under Viking&#x27;s colours. This further established their dominance over the other partners, although SF Line did take delivery of the new MS &quot;Turella&quot; and MS &quot;Rosella&quot; in 1979–80 and Slite MS &quot;Diana II&quot; in 1979. In the early 1980s Sally started expanding their operations to other waters, which became the company&#x27;s failing as those operations were largely unprofitable and ultimately made Sally unable to invest on new tonnage for Viking Line service.
=== 1985–1993 ===
In 1985 a new leaf was turned in Viking Line&#x27;s history when SF Line&#x27;s brand-new MS &quot;Mariella&quot;, at the time the largest ferry in the world, replaced MS &quot;Viking Song&quot; on Helsinki–Stockholm service, breaking Sally&#x27;s monopoly on the route. The next year Slite took delivery of Mariella&#x27;s sister MS &quot;Olympia&quot; and thus forced Sally out of Helsinki–Stockholm traffic completely. While SF Line and Slite were planning additional newbuilds, Sally were in an extremely poor position financially and in 1987 Effoa and Johnson Line, the owners of Silja Line, purchased Sally. As a result, SF Line and Slite forced Sally to leave the Viking Line consortium.

Between 1988 and 1990 SF Line took delivery of three new ships (MS &quot;Amorella&quot;, MS &quot;Isabella&quot; and MS &quot;Cinderella&quot;) while Slite took delivery of two (MS &quot;Athena&quot; and MS &quot;Kalypso&quot;).Unfortunately Wärtsilä Marine, the shipyard building one of SF Line&#x27;s newbuilds and both of Slite&#x27;s, went bankrupt in 1989. SF Line avoided financial repercussions, their Cinderella had been continuously paid for as her construction progressed. Hence it was SF Line who owned the almost completed ship when the shipyard went bankrupt. Slite however had signed a more traditional type of contract, the Kalypso was to be paid for on delivery. Since the shipyard owned the unfinished ship, this led to an increased cost for the Kalypso—about 200 million SEK more than had been originally envisaged. In the end, despite the financial problems, by 1990 Viking Line had the largest and newest cruiseferry fleet in the world.

In 1989 Slite started planning MS &quot;Europa&quot;, which was to be the jewel in the company&#x27;s crown, the largest and most luxurious cruiseferry in the world. Unfortunately for them Sweden entered a financial crisis during the construction of the ship, which led to devaluation of the Swedish krona. This in turn meant that the cost for the Europa increased by 400 million SEK. When time came to take delivery of the new ship, Slite did not have the funds to pay for it and their main funders (Swedish Nordbanken, who were also the main funders of Silja Line) refused to loan them the money needed. Eventually the ship ended up in Silja Line&#x27;s fleet and Slite was forced to declare bankruptcy in 1993.

=== 1993–2010 ===
Following the bankruptcy of Rederi AB Slite, SF Line was left as the sole operator under the Viking Line brand. The remaining two Slite ships, &quot;Athena&quot; and &quot;Kalypso&quot; were auctioned in August 1993. SF Line made a bid for the &quot;Kalypso&quot;, but both ships ended up sold to the newly established Malaysian cruise ship operator Star Cruises. In 1995 SF Line changed their name into Viking Line.

Between 1994 and 1996 the company operated a fast ferry service from Helsinki to Tallinn during the summers on chartered catamaran ships. In 1997 they purchased MS &quot;Silja Scandinavia&quot; from Sea-Link Shipping AB and renamed her for Helsinki–Stockholm service. It has been reported that around the same time plans were made to construct a pair of new ships for the Helsinki–Stockholm service so that Viking could better compete with Silja on that route, but the plans were shelved.

In 2006 Sea Containers Ltd—that had become the main owner of Silja Line in 1999—placed Silja Line and their cargo-carrying subsidiary SeaWind Line for sale, except for and that were transferred under Sea Container&#x27;s direct ownership and eventually sold. Viking Line placed a bid for their main competitor, but were outbid by the Estonian Tallink.

The first new ship built for Viking Line since Slite&#x27;s MS &quot;Kalypso&quot; in 1990, , had been ordered from Aker Finnyards in 2005, in response to growing competition from Tallink on the Helsinki–Tallinn route. The &quot;Viking XPRS&quot; eventually entered service for Viking in April 2008. A second new ship was ordered in January 2007, when Viking Line announced that they had placed an order for a ferry at the Spanish shipyard Astilleros de Sevilla. The project name for the ship, that would have replaced the on the Mariehamn–Kapellskär route, was &quot;Viking ADCC&quot;. Her delivery was originally expected for March 2009, but after delivery of the ship had been delayed multiple times, on 8 February 2010 Viking Line decided to cancel the contract altogether.

=== 2010–present ===
Nils-Erik Eklund retired as Viking Line&#x27;s CEO in July 2010. He was replaced by Mikael Backman, who has previously worked with Royal Caribbean. In interviews Backman has stated he hopes to introduce features from Caribbean cruise ships to Viking Line vessels, as well as begin selling Viking&#x27;s routes to North American customers as a new cruise experience.

In a seminar held in January 2010, Backman stated that Viking Line were negotiating with nine different shipyards about the possibility of constructing a pair of ships to replace &quot;Amorella&quot; and &quot;Isabella&quot; on the Turku–Stockholm service. The possibility of using liquefied natural gas engines and other emission-reducing technologies were reportedly researched, while according to Mikael Backman the ships would include various features akin to those found onboard cruise ships such as Royal Caribbean International&#x27;s . Projected delivery dates for the vessels were May 2012 and February 2013.

In October 2010 Viking Line signed a letter of intent with STX Turku for a 57,000 GT cruiseferry for the Turku–Stockholm route. Two months later, the formal order for the new ship was placed. The new ship, christened &quot;Viking Grace&quot;, was laid down on 6 March 2012 and launched on 10 August. The ship entered service in January 2013. Viking Line had an option for a sister ship but announced in May 2012 that they have decided not to build it.

Viking Line revealed in November 2016, that a letter of intent had been signed with Chinese shipyard Xiamen Shipbuilding for the construction of a 63,000 GT cruiseferry that would on completion replace the Amorella in the Viking Line fleet. The new ship would be LNG powered and would sport Flettner rotors to reduce fuel consumption.

On May 27, 2019, Viking Line announced the official name of the ship, M/S Viking Glory, after a public name-giving contest.

The maiden voyage of M/S Viking Glory took place from March 1–2, 2022. She is in service on the Stockholm-Mariehamn-Turku route.

==Ville Viking==
Ville Viking is the mascot of Viking Line, which is used as an icon for activities for children passengers, marketing and merchandising. The white ship&#x27;s cat figure appears on ships and Viking Line&#x27;s marketing events at least in Finland and Sweden. The feline figure can be hugged and can appear in pictures with people.

The name of the Viking Line children&#x27;s club is Ville Viking Club. Children under 12 years of age can join the club free of charge, and members receive a mail letter twice per year. The club has its own cruises from Turku once per week and from Helsinki once per month except for the summer holiday season.

Alcohol-free Ville Viking drinks can be bought on Viking Line&#x27;s ships. Children&#x27;s menus and buffet tables on the ships are also named for the character.

In 2007 a CD of children&#x27;s songs was published under the Ville Viking name.

<doc id="230390" wikidata="Q34284" url="?curid=230390" title="Blackmail">
<text>Blackmail is a criminal act of coercion using a threat.

As a criminal offense, blackmail is defined in various ways in common law jurisdictions. In the United States, blackmail is generally defined as a crime of information, involving a threat to do something that would cause a person to suffer embarrassment or financial loss. By contrast, in the Commonwealth its definition is wider: for example the laws of England and Wales and Northern Ireland state that:

In popular culture, &#x27;blackmail&#x27; involves a threat to reveal or publicize either substantially true or false information about a person or people unless certain demands are met. It is often damaging information, and it may be revealed to family members or associates rather than to the general public.

Acts of blackmail can also involve using threats of physical, mental or emotional harm, or of criminal prosecution, against the victim or someone close to the victim. It is normally carried out for personal gain, most commonly of position, money, or property. 
Blackmail may also be considered a form of extortion and may be covered in the same statutory provision as extortion. Although the two are generally synonymous, extortion is the taking of personal property by threat of future harm. Blackmail is the use of threat to prevent another from engaging in a lawful occupation and writing libelous letters or letters that provoke a breach of the peace, as well as use of intimidation for purposes of collecting an unpaid debt.

In many jurisdictions, blackmail is a statutory offense, often criminal, carrying punitive sanctions for convicted perpetrators. Blackmail is the name of a statutory offense in the United States, England and Wales, and Australia, and has been used as a convenient way of referring to certain other offenses, but was not a term used in English law until 1968.

Blackmail was originally a term from the Scottish Borders meaning payments rendered in exchange for protection from thieves and marauders. The &quot;mail&quot; part of blackmail derives from Middle English meaning &quot;rent or tribute&quot;. This tribute (male or &quot;reditus&quot;) was paid in goods or labour (&quot;nigri&quot;); hence &quot;reditus nigri&quot;, or &quot;blackmail&quot;.

==Etymology==
The word blackmail is variously derived from the word for mailing (in modern terms, protection racket) paid by English and Scottish border dwellers to Border Reivers in return for immunity from raids and other harassment. The &quot;mail&quot; part of blackmail derives from Middle English , &quot;rent, tribute&quot;. This tribute was paid in goods or labour (&quot;reditus nigri&quot;, or &quot;blackmail&quot;); the opposite is &quot;blanche firmes&quot; or &quot;reditus albi&quot;, or &quot;white rent&quot; (denoting payment by silver). An alternative version is that rents in the Scottish Borders were often paid in produce of the land, called &quot;greenmail&quot; (&#x27;green rent&#x27;), suggesting &quot;blackmail&quot; as a counterpart paid perforce to the reivers. Alternatively, Mackay derives it from two Scottish Gaelic words pronounced (the th silent) bla-ich (to protect) and (tribute, payment), cf. buttock mail. He notes that the practice was common in the Scottish Highlands as well as the Borders. In the Irish language, the term &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;black rent&quot;, was used for similar exactions.

==Objections to criminalization==
Some scholars have argued that blackmail should not be a crime. Objections to the criminalization of blackmail often rest on what legal scholars call &quot;the paradox of blackmail&quot;: it takes two separate actions that, in many cases, people are legally and morally entitled to do, and criminalizes them if done together. One American legal scholar uses the example of a person who threatens to expose a criminal act unless he is paid money. The person has committed the crime of blackmail, even though he separately has the legal right both to threaten to expose a crime and to request money from a person.

<text>In computer science, the Floyd–Warshall algorithm (also known as Floyd&#x27;s algorithm, the Roy–Warshall algorithm, the Roy–Floyd algorithm, or the WFI algorithm) is an algorithm for finding shortest paths in a directed weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights (but with no negative cycles). A single execution of the algorithm will find the lengths (summed weights) of shortest paths between all pairs of vertices. Although it does not return details of the paths themselves, it is possible to reconstruct the paths with simple modifications to the algorithm. Versions of the algorithm can also be used for finding the transitive closure of a relation formula_1, or (in connection with the Schulze voting system) widest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph.

==History and naming==
The Floyd–Warshall algorithm is an example of dynamic programming, and was published in its currently recognized form by Robert Floyd in 1962. However, it is essentially the same as algorithms previously published by Bernard Roy in 1959 and also by Stephen Warshall in 1962 for finding the transitive closure of a graph, and is closely related to Kleene&#x27;s algorithm (published in 1956) for converting a deterministic finite automaton into a regular expression, with the difference being the use of a min-plus semiring. The modern formulation of the algorithm as three nested for-loops was first described by Peter Ingerman, also in 1962.

==Algorithm==
The Floyd–Warshall algorithm compares many possible paths through the graph between each pair of vertices. It is guaranteed to find all shortest paths and is able to do this with formula_2 comparisons in a graph, even though there may be formula_3 edges in the graph. It does so by incrementally improving an estimate on the shortest path between two vertices, until the estimate is optimal.

Consider a graph formula_4 with vertices formula_5 numbered 1 through formula_6. Further consider a function formula_7 that returns the length of the shortest possible path (if one exists) from formula_8 to formula_9 using vertices only from the set formula_10 as intermediate points along the way. Now, given this function, our goal is to find the length of the shortest path from each formula_8 to each formula_9 using &quot;any&quot; vertex in formula_13. By definition, this is the value formula_14, which we will find recursively.

Observe that formula_7 must be less than or equal to formula_16: we have &quot;more&quot; flexibility if we are allowed to use the vertex formula_17. If formula_7 is in fact less than formula_16, then there must be a path from formula_8 to formula_9 using the vertices formula_10 that is shorter than any such path that does not use the vertex formula_17. Since there are no negative cycles this path can be decomposed as:

:(1) a path from formula_8 to formula_17 that uses the vertices formula_26, followed by

:(2) a path from formula_17 to formula_9 that uses the vertices formula_26.

And of course, these must be a &quot;shortest&quot; such path (or several of them), otherwise we could further decrease the length. In other words, we have arrived at the recursive formula:
: formula_30
:: formula_31
::: formula_32.
The base case is given by
: formula_33
where formula_34 denotes the weight of the edge from formula_8 to formula_9 if one exists and ∞ (infinity) otherwise.

These formulas are the heart of the Floyd–Warshall algorithm. The algorithm works by first computing formula_7 for all formula_38 pairs for formula_39, then formula_40, then formula_41, and so on. This process continues until formula_42, and we have found the shortest path for all formula_38 pairs using any intermediate vertices. Pseudocode for this basic version follows.

===Pseudocode===

 let dist be a |V| × |V| array of minimum distances initialized to ∞ (infinity)
 for each edge (&quot;u&quot;, &quot;v&quot;) do
 dist[&quot;u&quot;][&quot;v&quot;] = w(&quot;u&quot;, &quot;v&quot;) &quot;// The weight of the edge (&quot;u&quot;, &quot;v&quot;)&quot;
 for each vertex &quot;v&quot; do
 dist[&quot;v&quot;][&quot;v&quot;] = 0
 for &quot;k&quot; from 1 to |V|
 for &quot;i&quot; from 1 to |V|
 for &quot;j&quot; from 1 to |V|
 if dist[&quot;i&quot;][&quot;j&quot;] &gt; dist[&quot;i&quot;][&quot;k&quot;] + dist[&quot;k&quot;][&quot;j&quot;] 
 dist[&quot;i&quot;][&quot;j&quot;] = dist[&quot;i&quot;][&quot;k&quot;] + dist[&quot;k&quot;][&quot;j&quot;]
 end if

==Example==
The algorithm above is executed on the graph on the left below:

Prior to the first recursion of the outer loop, labeled above, the only known paths correspond to the single edges in the graph. At , paths that go through the vertex 1 are found: in particular, the path [2,1,3] is found, replacing the path [2,3] which has fewer edges but is longer (in terms of weight). At , paths going through the vertices {1,2} are found. The red and blue boxes show how the path [4,2,1,3] is assembled from the two known paths [4,2] and [2,1,3] encountered in previous iterations, with 2 in the intersection. The path [4,2,3] is not considered, because [2,1,3] is the shortest path encountered so far from 2 to 3. At , paths going through the vertices {1,2,3} are found. Finally, at , all shortest paths are found.

The distance matrix at each iteration of , with the updated distances in bold, will be:



==Behavior with negative cycles==

A negative cycle is a cycle whose edges sum to a negative value. There is no shortest path between any pair of vertices formula_8, formula_9 which form part of a negative cycle, because path-lengths from formula_8 to formula_9 can be arbitrarily small (negative). For numerically meaningful output, the Floyd–Warshall algorithm assumes that there are no negative cycles. Nevertheless, if there are negative cycles, the Floyd–Warshall algorithm can be used to detect them. The intuition is as follows:

* The Floyd–Warshall algorithm iteratively revises path lengths between all pairs of vertices formula_38, including where formula_49;
* Initially, the length of the path formula_50 is zero;
* A path formula_51 can only improve upon this if it has length less than zero, i.e. denotes a negative cycle;
* Thus, after the algorithm, formula_50 will be negative if there exists a negative-length path from formula_8 back to formula_8.

Hence, to detect negative cycles using the Floyd–Warshall algorithm, one can inspect the diagonal of the path matrix, and the presence of a negative number indicates that the graph contains at least one negative cycle. During the execution of the algorithm, if there is a negative cycle, exponentially large numbers can appear, as large as formula_55, where formula_56 is the largest absolute value of a negative edge in the graph. To avoid overflow/underflow problems one should check for negative numbers on the diagonal of the path matrix within the inner for loop of the algorithm. Obviously, in an undirected graph a negative edge creates a negative cycle (i.e., a closed walk) involving its incident vertices. Considering all edges of the above example graph as undirected, e.g. the vertex sequence 4 – 2 – 4 is a cycle with weight sum −2.

==Path reconstruction==

The Floyd–Warshall algorithm typically only provides the lengths of the paths between all pairs of vertices. With simple modifications, it is possible to create a method to reconstruct the actual path between any two endpoint vertices. While one may be inclined to store the actual path from each vertex to each other vertex, this is not necessary, and in fact, is very costly in terms of memory. Instead, we can use the shortest-path tree, which can be calculated for each node in formula_57 time using formula_58 memory, and allows us to efficiently reconstruct a directed path between any two connected vertices.

=== Pseudocode ===

The array holds the penultimate vertex on the path from to (except in the case of , where it always contains even if there is no self-loop on ):

 let dist be a formula_59 array of minimum distances initialized to formula_60 (infinity)
 let prev be a formula_59 array of vertex indices initialized to null
 procedure &quot;FloydWarshallWithPathReconstruction&quot;() is
 for each edge (u, v) do
 dist[u][v] = w(u, v) &quot;// The weight of the edge (u, v)&quot;
 prev[u][v] = u
 for each vertex v do
 dist[v][v] = 0
 prev[v][v] = v
 for k from 1 to |V| do &quot;// standard Floyd-Warshall implementation&quot;
 for i from 1 to |V|
 for j from 1 to |V|
 if dist[i][j] &gt; dist[i][k] + dist[k][j] then
 dist[i][j] = dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]
 prev[i][j] = prev[k][j]

 procedure &quot;Path&quot;(u, v) is
 if prev[u][v] = null then
 return []
 path = [v]
 while &quot;u&quot; ≠ &quot;v&quot; do
 v = prev[u][v]
 path.prepend(v)
 return path

==Time complexity==
Let formula_62 be formula_63, the number of vertices. To find all formula_64 of 
formula_7 (for all formula_8 and formula_9) from those of
formula_16 requires formula_69 operations. Since we begin with
formula_70 and compute the sequence of formula_62 matrices formula_72, formula_73, formula_74, formula_75, each having a cost of formula_69,
the total time complexity of the algorithm is formula_77.

==Applications and generalizations==
The Floyd–Warshall algorithm can be used to solve the following problems, among others:
* Shortest paths in directed graphs (Floyd&#x27;s algorithm).
* Transitive closure of directed graphs (Warshall&#x27;s algorithm). In Warshall&#x27;s original formulation of the algorithm, the graph is unweighted and represented by a Boolean adjacency matrix. Then the addition operation is replaced by logical conjunction (AND) and the minimum operation by logical disjunction (OR).
* Finding a regular expression denoting the regular language accepted by a finite automaton (Kleene&#x27;s algorithm, a closely related generalization of the Floyd–Warshall algorithm)
* Inversion of real matrices (Gauss–Jordan algorithm)
* Optimal routing. In this application one is interested in finding the path with the maximum flow between two vertices. This means that, rather than taking minima as in the pseudocode above, one instead takes maxima. The edge weights represent fixed constraints on flow. Path weights represent bottlenecks; so the addition operation above is replaced by the minimum operation.
* Fast computation of Pathfinder networks.
* Widest paths/Maximum bandwidth paths
* Computing canonical form of difference bound matrices (DBMs)
* Computing the similarity between graphs
* Transitive closure in AND/OR/threshold graphs.

==Implementations==
Implementations are available for many programming languages.
* For C++, in the boost::graph library
* For C#, at QuikGraph
* For C#, at QuickGraphPCL (A fork of QuickGraph with better compatibility with projects using Portable Class Libraries.)
* For Java, in the Apache Commons Graph library
* For JavaScript, in the Cytoscape library
* For Julia, in the Graphs.jl package
* For MATLAB, in the Matlab_bgl package
* For Perl, in the Graph module
* For Python, in the SciPy library (module scipy.sparse.csgraph) or NetworkX library
* For R, in packages e1071 and Rfast
* For C, a pthreads, parallelized, implementation including a SQLite interface to the data at floydWarshall.h

==Comparison with other shortest path algorithms==
For graphs with non-negative edge weights, Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm can be used to find all shortest paths from a &quot;single&quot; vertex with running time formula_78. Thus, running Dijkstra starting at &quot;each&quot; vertex takes time formula_79. Since formula_80, this yields a worst-case running time of repeated Dijkstra of formula_81. While this matches the asymptotic worst-case running time of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, the constants involved matter quite a lot. When a graph is dense (i.e., formula_82), the Floyd-Warshall algorithm tends to perform better in practice. When the graph is sparse (i.e., formula_83 is significantly smaller than formula_84), Dijkstra tends to dominate.

For sparse graphs with negative edges but no negative cycles, Johnson&#x27;s algorithm can be used, with the same asymptotic running time as the repeated Dijkstra approach.

There are also known algorithms using fast matrix multiplication to speed up all-pairs shortest path computation in dense graphs, but these typically make extra assumptions on the edge weights (such as requiring them to be small integers). In addition, because of the high constant factors in their running time, they would only provide a speedup over the Floyd–Warshall algorithm for very large graphs.

<text>A trade name, trading name, or business name is a pseudonym used by companies that do not operate under their registered company name. The term for this type of alternative name is fictitious business name. Registering the fictitious name with a relevant government body is often required.

In a number of countries, the phrase &quot;trading as&quot; (abbreviated to t/a) is used to designate a trade name. In the United States, the phrase &quot;doing business as&quot; (abbreviated to DBA, dba, d.b.a., or d/b/a) is used, among others, such as assumed business name or fictitious business name. In Canada, &quot;operating as&quot; (abbreviated to o/a) and &quot;&quot;trading as&quot; are used, although &quot;doing business as&quot;&quot; is also sometimes used.

A company typically uses a trade name to conduct business using a simpler name rather than using their formal and often lengthier name. Trade names are also used when a preferred name cannot be registered, often because it may already be registered or is too similar to a name that is already registered.

==Legal aspects==
Using one or more fictitious business names does not create additional separate legal entities. The distinction between a registered legal name and a fictitious business name, or trade name, is important because fictitious business names do not always identify the entity that is legally responsible. 

Legal agreements (such as contracts) are normally made using the registered legal name of the business. If a corporation fails to consistently adhere to such important legal formalities like using its registered legal name in contracts, it may be subject to piercing of the corporate veil. 

In English, trade names are generally treated as proper nouns.

== By country ==

===Argentina===
In Argentina, a trade name is known as a &quot;nombre de fantasía&quot; (&#x27;fantasy&#x27; or &#x27;fiction&#x27; name), and the legal name of business is called a &quot;razón social&quot; (social name).

===Brazil===
In Brazil, a trade name is known as a &quot;nome fantasia&quot; (&#x27;fantasy&#x27; or &#x27;fiction&#x27; name), and the legal name of business is called &quot;razão social&quot; (social name).

===Canada===
In some Canadian jurisdictions, such as Ontario, when a businessperson writes a trade name on a contract, invoice, or cheque, they must also add the legal name of the business.

Numbered companies will very often operate as something other than their legal name, which is unrecognizable to the public.

===Chile===
In Chile, a trade name is known as a &quot;nombre de fantasía&quot; (&#x27;fantasy&#x27; or &#x27;fiction&#x27; name), and the legal name of business is called a &quot;razón social&quot; (social name).

===Ireland===

In Ireland, businesses are legally required to register business names where these differ from the surname(s) of the sole trader or partners, or the legal name of a company. The Companies Registration Office publishes a searchable register of such business names.

===Japan===
In Japan, the word is used.

===Kenya===
===Nigeria===
In Colonial Nigeria, certain tribes had members that used a variety of trading names to conduct business with the Europeans. Two examples were King Perekule VII of Bonny, who was known as &quot;Captain Pepple&quot; in trade matters, and King Jubo Jubogha of Opobo, who bore the pseudonym &quot;Captain Jaja&quot;. Both Pepple and Jaja would bequeath their trade names to their royal descendants as official surnames upon their deaths.

===Singapore===
In Singapore, there is no filing requirement for a &quot;trading as&quot; name, but there are requirements for disclosure of the underlying business or company&#x27;s registered name and unique entity number.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, there is no filing requirement for a &quot;business name&quot;, defined as &quot;any name under which someone carries on business&quot; that, for a company or limited liability partnership, &quot;is not its registered name&quot;, but there are requirements for disclosure of the owner&#x27;s true name and some restrictions on the use of certain names.

===United States===
A minority of U.S. states, including Washington, still use the term &quot;trade name&quot; to refer to &quot;doing business as&quot; (DBA) names. In most U.S. states now, however, DBAs are officially referred to using other terms. Almost half of the states, including New York and Oregon, use the terms &quot;assumed business name&quot; or &quot;assumed name&quot;; nearly as many, including Pennsylvania, use the term &quot;fictitious name&quot;.

For consumer protection purposes, many U.S. jurisdictions require businesses operating with fictitious names to file a DBA statement, though names including the first and last name of the owner may be accepted. This also reduces the possibility of two local businesses operating under the same name, although some jurisdictions do not provide exclusivity for a name, or may allow more than one party to register the same name. Note, though, that this is not a substitute for filing a trademark application. A DBA filing carries no legal weight in establishing trademark rights. In the U.S., trademark rights are acquired by use in commerce, but there can be substantial benefits to filing a trademark application. Sole proprietors are the most common users of DBAs. Sole proprietors are individual business owners who run their businesses themselves. Since most people in these circumstances use a business name other than their own name, it is often necessary for them to get DBAs.

Generally, a DBA must be registered with a local or state government, or both, depending on the jurisdiction. For example, California, Texas and Virginia require a DBA to be registered with each county (or independent city in the case of Virginia) where the owner does business. Maryland and Colorado have DBAs registered with a state agency. Virginia also requires corporations and LLCs to file a copy of their registration with the county or city to be registered with the State Corporation Commission.

DBA statements are often used in conjunction with a franchise. The franchisee will have a legal name under which it may sue and be sued, but will conduct business under the franchiser&#x27;s brand name (which the public would recognize). A typical real-world example can be found in a well-known pricing mistake case, &quot;Donovan v. RRL Corp.&quot;, 26 Cal. 4th 261 (2001), where the named defendant, RRL Corporation, was a Lexus car dealership doing business as &quot;Lexus of Westminster&quot;, but remaining a separate legal entity from Lexus, a division of Toyota Motor Sales, USA, Inc..

In California, filing a DBA statement also requires that a notice of the fictitious name be published in local newspapers for some set period of time to inform the public of the owner&#x27;s intent to operate under an assumed name. The intention of the law is to protect the public from fraud, by compelling the business owner to first file or register his fictitious business name with the county clerk, and then making a further public record of it by publishing it in a newspaper. Several other states, such as Illinois, require print notices as well.

===Uruguay===
In Uruguay, a trade name is known as a &quot;nombre fantasía&quot;, and the legal name of business is called a &quot;razón social&quot;.

<text>Hamburger University is a training facility at the McDonald&#x27;s Corporation global headquarters in Chicago, Illinois. It instructs high-potential restaurant managers, mid-managers, and owner-operators in restaurant management. Hamburger University&#x27;s mission is to become an “organizational culture hub, introducing a continuous education process for the value chain and transforming knowledge into actual business results.” Hamburger University students take courses about restaurant operations, leadership skills, customer service, operations, and procedures.

More than 5,000 students attend Hamburger University each year and over 275,000 people have graduated with a degree in &quot;Hamburgerology.&quot; 40% of McDonald&#x27;s global leadership has attended Hamburger University.

==History==
Hamburger University training started in 1961 with a class of 14 people in the basement of one of its restaurants. The educational program was operated by Fred L. Turner, a grill cook. Turner would eventually contribute significantly to the growth of McDonald&#x27;s and become the CEO of McDonald&#x27;s for 20 years.

Hamburger University was originally located on an 80-acre (32 ha) campus at the company&#x27;s global headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois from its founding until 2018, when both the McDonald&#x27;s headquarters and Hamburger University moved to West Loop, Chicago, in a new complex built on the site of the former headquarters of Oprah Winfrey&#x27;s Harpo Studios.

The previous location in Oak Brook was purchased in June 2019 by John Paul DeJoria, co-founder of John Paul Mitchell Systems.

==Locations==

Hamburger University currently has eight campuses worldwide in addition to the main campus in Chicago, Illinois: Tokyo, London, Sydney, Munich, São Paulo, Shanghai, and Moscow.

The Shanghai location is housed in a 28-story building that serves as McDonald&#x27;s China headquarters. The school takes up and is decorated with pictures of McDonald&#x27;s products and equipment. The school accepts less than 1% of applicants.

==In popular culture==
Hamburger University was satirized in the 1986 comedy &quot;&quot;. It was also spoofed by McDonald&#x27;s itself in a commercial with Ronald McDonald in which several animatronic hamburgers were shown graduating.

<text>Sittard (; ) is a city in the Netherlands, situated in the southernmost province of Limburg.

The town is part of the municipality of Sittard-Geleen and has almost 37,500 inhabitants in 2016.

In its east, Sittard borders the German municipality of Selfkant (in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia).

The city centre is located at 45 m above sea level.

==History==
Archaeological discoveries have dated the first settlement in the Sittard area around 5000 B.C. Present day Sittard is assumed to have been founded around 850 A.D. and to have been built around a motte. Sittard was first mentioned in 1157. It was granted city rights by the Duke of Limburg in 1243. In 1400 it was sold to the Duchy of Jülich, and remained in its possession until 1794. The city was destroyed and rebuilt repeatedly, due to fires and various conflicts during the 15th-17th century. It was a stronghold until it was largely destroyed in 1677, during the Franco-Dutch War. Under French occupation (1794-1814), Sittard was part of the Roer department. Since 1814, it has been part of the Netherlands, except for the years 1830–1839, when it joined the Belgian Revolution. During the Second World War, it was occupied by the Germans, who incorporated several small municipalities, like Broeksittard, into Sittard. The city was liberated September 18–19, 1944 by the 2nd Armored Division. The historic town was mostly spared destruction, despite lying in the frontline for over four months, in which over 4000 shells and rockets struck the city.

After World War II, Sittard expanded rapidly and many new neighbourhoods were built. The coal mines in the region were the driving force of a booming economy, until closed in the 1960s and 70s. It now has large industrial zones and office premises.

==Main sights==


Sittard has a small historic city centre with numerous architectural monuments, including several old churches, monasteries and a few half-timbered houses. The city centre is a protected area (&quot;beschermd stadsbezicht&quot;).

The most important monuments are:
*St Peter&#x27;s Church, 14th-16th century, Gothic style. The 16th-century tower received its current steeple in 1875.
*Dominican monastery, 17th century, with the Baroque St Michael&#x27;s Church
*Dominican nunnery St.-Agnetenberg, 17th century
*Reformed Church, 17th century
*Ursulines nunnery and boarding school, 16th-19th century
*Basilica of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart (1875–77) and Mariapark (1891), pilgrimage sites
*The medieval city wall
*Half-timbered houses, 16th-17th century
*The Jacob Kritzraedt house, 17th century, Mannerist style
*Watermills, 16th-17th century
*City park, 1921–27

The central market square has many restaurants and bars. The city has retained part of its city wall. On the south-eastern side of the city centre, the St Rosa chapel crowns the Kollenberg hill. Museum &quot;Het Domein&quot; is situated in a converted nineteenth century school building in the city centre. It focuses on contemporary art, urban history and archaeology. There is also a Commonwealth War Cemetery, where 239 soldiers of the Commonwealth Nations lie buried. Among them Dennis Donnini, the youngest to have received the Victoria Cross in World War II.

==Economy==

Sittard houses the SABIC European head office and a large DSM office; both companies having large chemical production facilities in nearby Geleen. The head office of the plant hire company Boels Rental is also located in Sittard.

==Education==

There are several schools for higher vocational education and training (hbo) in the city, including faculties of the Hogeschool Zuyd and Fontys Hogescholen. Large schools for secondary education in Sittard are &#x27;Trevianum Scholengroep&#x27; (havo and vwo) and &#x27;Da Capo College&#x27; (vmbo).

<text>In object-oriented programming, object copying is creating a copy of an existing object, a unit of data in object-oriented programming. The resulting object is called an &quot;object copy&quot; or simply &quot;copy&quot; of the original object. Copying is basic but has subtleties and can have significant overhead. There are several ways to copy an object, most commonly by a copy constructor or cloning. Copying is done mostly so the copy can be modified or moved, or the current value preserved. If either of these is unneeded, a reference to the original data is sufficient and more efficient, as no copying occurs.

Objects in general store composite data. While in simple cases copying can be done by allocating a new, uninitialized object and copying all fields (attributes) from the original object, in more complex cases this does not result in desired behavior.

== Methods of copying ==
The design goal of most objects is to give the resemblance of being made out of one monolithic block even though most are not. As objects are made up of several different parts, copying becomes nontrivial. Several strategies exist to treat this problem.

Consider an object A, which contains fields xi (more concretely, consider if A is a string and xi is an array of its characters). There are different strategies for making a copy of A, referred to as &quot;shallow copy&quot; and &quot;deep copy&quot;. Many languages allow generic copying by one or either strategy, defining either one &quot;copy&quot; operation or separate &quot;shallow copy&quot; and &quot;deep copy&quot; operations. Note that even shallower is to use a reference to the existing object A, in which case there is no new object, only a new reference.

The terminology of &quot;shallow copy&quot; and &quot;deep copy&quot; dates to Smalltalk-80. The same distinction holds for comparing objects for equality: most basically there is a difference between identity (same object) and equality (same value), corresponding to shallow equality and (1 level) deep equality of two object references, but then further whether equality means comparing only the fields of the object in question or dereferencing some or all fields and comparing their values in turn (e.g., are two linked lists equal if they have the same nodes, or if they have same values?).

=== Shallow copy ===
One method of copying an object is the &quot;shallow copy&quot;. In that case a new object B is created, and the fields values of A are copied over to B. This is also known as a &quot;field-by-field copy&quot;, &quot;field-for-field copy&quot;, or &quot;field copy&quot;. If the field value is a reference to an object (e.g., a memory address) it copies the reference, hence referring to the same object as A does, and if the field value is a primitive type, it copies the value of the primitive type. In languages without primitive types (where everything is an object), all fields of the copy B are references to the same objects as the fields of original A. The referenced objects are thus &quot;shared&quot;, so if one of these objects is modified (from A or B), the change is visible in the other. Shallow copies are simple and typically cheap, as they can usually be implemented by simply copying the bits exactly.

=== Deep copy ===
An alternative is a deep copy, meaning that fields are dereferenced: rather than references to objects being copied, new copy of objects are created for any referenced objects, and references to these are placed in B. Later modifications to the contents of either remain unique to A or B, as the contents are not shared.

=== Combination ===
In more complex cases, some fields in a copy should have shared values with the original object (as in a shallow copy), corresponding to an &quot;association&quot; relationship; and some fields should have copies (as in a deep copy), corresponding to an &quot;aggregation&quot; relationship. In these cases a custom implementation of copying is generally required; this issue and solution dates to Smalltalk-80. Alternatively, fields can be marked as requiring a shallow copy or deep copy, and copy operations automatically generated (likewise for comparison operations). This is not implemented in most object-oriented languages, however, though there is partial support in Eiffel.

== Implementation ==

Nearly all object-oriented programming languages provide some way to copy objects. As most languages do not provide most objects for programs, a programmer must define how an object should be copied, just as they must define if two objects are identical or even comparable in the first place. Many languages provide some default behavior.

How copying is solved varies from language to language, and what concept of an object it has.

=== Lazy copy ===

A lazy copy is an implementation of a deep copy. When initially copying an object, a (fast) shallow copy is used. A counter is also used to track how many objects share the data. When the program wants to modify an object, it can determine if the data is shared (by examining the counter) and can do a deep copy if needed.

Lazy copy looks to the outside just as a deep copy, but takes advantage of the speed of a shallow copy whenever possible. The downside are rather high but constant base costs because of the counter. Also, in certain situations, circular references can cause problems.

Lazy copy is related to copy-on-write.

=== In Java ===
The following presents examples for one of the most widely used object-oriented languages, Java, which should cover nearly every way that an object-oriented language can treat this problem.

Unlike in C++, objects in Java are always accessed indirectly through references. Objects are never created implicitly but instead are always passed or assigned by a reference variable. (Methods in Java are always &quot;pass by value&quot;, however, it is the value of the reference variable that is being passed.) The Java Virtual Machine manages garbage collection so that objects are cleaned up after they are no longer reachable. There is no automatic way to copy any given object in Java.

Copying is usually performed by a clone() method of a class. This method usually, in turn, calls the clone() method of its parent class to obtain a copy, and then does any custom copying procedures. Eventually this gets to the clone() method of codice_1 (the uppermost class), which creates a new instance of the same class as the object and copies all the fields to the new instance (a &quot;shallow copy&quot;). If this method is used, the class must implement the marker interface, or else it will throw a &quot;Clone Not Supported Exception&quot;. After obtaining a copy from the parent class, a class&#x27; own clone() method may then provide custom cloning capability, like deep copying (i.e. duplicate some of the structures referred to by the object) or giving the new instance a new unique ID.

The return type of clone() is codice_1, but implementers of a clone method could write the type of the object being cloned instead due to Java&#x27;s support for covariant return types. One advantage of using clone() is that since it is an overridable method, we can call clone() on any object, and it will use the clone() method of its class, without the calling code needing to know what that class is (which would be needed with a copy constructor).

A disadvantage is that one often cannot access the clone() method on an abstract type. Most interfaces and abstract classes in Java do not specify a public clone() method. Thus, often the only way to use the clone() method is if the class of an object is known, which is contrary to the abstraction principle of using the most generic type possible. For example, if one has a List reference in Java, one cannot invoke clone() on that reference because List specifies no public clone() method. Implementations of List like Array List and Linked List all generally have clone() methods, but it is inconvenient and bad abstraction to carry around the class type of an object.

Another way to copy objects in Java is to serialize them through the interface. This is typically used for persistence and wire protocol purposes, but it does create copies of objects and, unlike clone, a deep copy that gracefully handles cycled graphs of objects is readily available with minimal effort from a programmer.

Both of these methods suffer from a notable problem: the constructor is not used for objects copied with clone or serialization. This can lead to bugs with improperly initialized data, prevents the use of codice_3 member fields, and makes maintenance challenging. Some utilities attempt to overcome these issues by using reflection to deep copy objects, such as the deep-cloning library.

=== In Eiffel ===

Runtime objects in Eiffel are accessible either indirectly through references or as &quot;expanded&quot; objects which fields are embedded within the objects that use them. That is, fields of an object are stored either externally or internally.

The Eiffel class codice_4 contains features for shallow and deep copying and cloning of objects. All Eiffel classes inherit from codice_4, so these features are available within all classes, and are applicable both to reference and expanded objects.

The codice_6 feature effects a shallow, field-by-field copy from one object to another. In this case no new object is created. If codice_7 were copied to codice_8, then the same objects referenced by codice_7 before the application of codice_6, will also be referenced by codice_8 after the codice_6 feature completes.

To effect the creation of a new object which is a shallow duplicate of codice_7, the feature codice_14 is used. In this case, one new object is created with its fields identical to those of the source.

The feature codice_14 relies on the feature codice_6, which can be redefined in descendants of codice_4, if needed. The result of codice_14 is of the anchored type codice_19.

Deep copying and creating deep twins can be done using the features codice_20 and codice_21, again inherited from class codice_4. These features have the potential to create many new objects, because they duplicate all the objects in an entire object structure. Because new duplicate objects are created instead of simply copying references to existing objects, deep operations will become a source of performance issues more readily than shallow operations.

=== In other languages ===
In C#, rather than using the interface codice_23, a generic extension method can be used to create a deep copy using reflection. This has two advantages: First, it provides the flexibility to copy every object without having to specify each property and variable to be copied manually. Second, because the type is generic, the compiler ensures that the destination object and the source object have the same type.

In Objective-C, the methods codice_24 and codice_25 are inherited by all objects and intended for performing copies; the latter is for creating a mutable type of the original object. These methods in turn call the codice_26 and codice_27 methods, respectively, to perform the copying. An object must implement the corresponding codice_26 method to be copyable.

In OCaml, the library function Oo.copy performs shallow copying of an object.

In Python, the library&#x27;s copy module provides shallow copy and deep copy of objects through the codice_29 and codice_30 functions, respectively. Programmers may define special methods codice_31 and codice_32 in an object to provide custom copying implementation.

In Ruby, all objects inherit two methods for performing shallow copies, clone and dup. The two methods differ in that codice_33 copies an object&#x27;s tainted state, frozen state, and any singleton methods it may have, whereas codice_34 copies only its tainted state. Deep copies may be achieved by dumping and loading an object&#x27;s byte stream or YAML serialization. Alternatively, you can use the deep_dive gem to do a controlled deep copy of your object graphs. 

In Perl, nested structures are stored by the use of references, thus a developer can either loop over the entire structure and re-reference the data or use the codice_35 function from the module Storable.

In VBA, an assignment of variables of type codice_1 is a shallow copy, an assignment for all other types (numeric types, String, user defined types, arrays) is a deep copy. So the keyword codice_37 for an assignment signals a shallow copy and the (optional) keyword codice_38 signals a deep copy. There is no built-in method for deep copies of Objects in VBA.

<doc id="230419" wikidata="Q7735837" url="?curid=230419" title="The Garden of Cyrus">
<text>The Garden of Cyrus, or &quot;The Quincuncial Lozenge, or Network Plantations of the Ancients, naturally, artificially, mystically considered&quot;, is a discourse by Thomas Browne concerned with the quincunx—a pattern of five points arranged in an X (⁙), as on a die —in art and nature. First published in 1658, along with its companion &quot;Urn-Burial&quot;, in modern times it has been recognised as Browne&#x27;s major literary contribution to Hermetic wisdom.

The book begins with the biblical creation, allusions to Plato&#x27;s discourse the &quot;Timaeus&quot; and speculation upon the location of the Garden of Eden. It continues on orchard planting patterns of the Ancient Persians, who used the quincunx pattern to ensure &quot;a regular angularity, and through prospect, was left on every side&quot;. Browne explores the number five and the quincunx pattern as seen in art and human design (chapters 1 and 2) as a pattern in nature, in particular through his extensive study of botany (central chapter 3) and mystically (chapters 4 and 5).

Written during a time when restrictions on publishing became more relaxed during Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s Protectorate, &quot;The Garden of Cyrus&quot; is Browne&#x27;s contribution to a &quot;boom period&quot; decade of interest in esoterica in England. Browne&#x27;s discourse is a neoplatonic and neopythagorean vision of the interconnection of art and nature via the inter-related symbols of the number five and the quincunx pattern, along with the figure X and the lattice design. Its fundamental quest was of primary concern to Hermetic philosophy: proof of the wisdom of God, and demonstrable evidence of intelligent design. The discourse includes early recorded usage of the words &quot;prototype&quot; and &quot;archetype&quot; in English.

The 19th- and 20th-century critic Edmund Gosse complained of the book that &quot;gathering his forces it is Quincunx, Quincunx, all the way until the very sky itself is darkened with revolving Chess-boards&quot;, while conceding that &quot;this radically bad book contains some of the most lovely paragraphs which passed from an English pen during the seventeenth century&quot;.

<doc id="230422" wikidata="Q389656" url="?curid=230422" title="Heusden, Belgium">
<text>Heusden was a municipality located in the Belgian province of East Flanders. In 1977 it merged with the municipality of Destelbergen, of which it is now part.

It was mentioned for the first time in the 11th century, by abbot Othejbold. Years after the invasion by the Norsemen, the municipality fell into the hands of the Lords of Heusden. Because of the marriage of Beatrix of Heusden with Zeger III (viscount of Ghent) in 1212, the seat of the viscountship of Ghent moved to Heusden. Until the end of the Ancien Régime Heusden stayed property of the viscounts of Ghent. In 1247 the Cistercian Abbey of Nieuwenbosch settled in Heusden. This cloister flourished until it was destroyed by the Iconoclasts in 1578. After this the sisters moved to Ghent. Because Heusden was a part of the belt of defence around Ghent, it was looted many times during the Middle Ages.

This rich history has resulted in a number of castles dotting the area.

==Toponymy==
According to one theory, the name Heusden derives from the personal name &quot;Kusidiniom&quot;.

Heusden was therefore named after &quot;the area of Kusidinios&quot;. 

The name Kusidinios could itself derive from the verb &#x27;to hear&#x27;. Thus, Kusidinios was someone with good hearing.

Over the centuries, the name &quot;Kusidiniom&quot; would have been corrupted and reduced, until it finally became &quot;Heusden&quot;, as we know it today.

==History==
The oldest mention of the village is when, in the 11th century, the Abbot Othejbold noted in a document that the place belonged to the Saint Bavo&#x27;s Abbey before the Norman invasion. A little later it fall under the control of the lords of Heusden. After the marriage in 1212 of Beatrix van Heusden to Zeger III, the viscount of Ghent, the viscountcy of Ghent was transferred to Heusden. Until the end of the Ancien Régime, Heusden remained under the viscounts of Ghent.

The area was inhabited in the prehistoric Mesolithic period (ca. 10,000 to ca. 5000 BC), which was shown by research in both Destelbergen and Heusden.

Heusden is known for the Cistercian abbey of Nieuwenbosch, which was founded in 1247. The monastery was well known. However, in 1578 it was destroyed by the iconoclasts and the monastery ceased to exist. The nuns of the monastery then moved to nearby Ghent. The only visible remaining structure on the Heusden site is the former abbey farm, now known as the &quot;Bosseveerhoeve&quot; (or &quot;hoeve Ten Bossche&quot; or &quot;hoeve Caenepeel&quot;).

An annual event in Heusden is the fairground race &quot;Grand Prix Maurice Raes&quot; popularly known as &quot;Heusden Koers&quot; or the &quot;world championship of fairground races&quot;. It is attended by about 20,000 cycling-enthusiasts.

<text>A BL Lacertae object or BL Lac object is a type of active galactic nucleus (AGN) or a galaxy with such an AGN, named after its prototype, BL Lacertae. In contrast to other types of active galactic nuclei, BL Lacs are characterized by rapid and large-amplitude flux variability and significant optical polarization. Because of these properties, the prototype of the class (BL Lac) was originally thought to be a variable star. When compared to the more luminous active nuclei (quasars) with strong emission lines, BL Lac objects have spectra dominated by a relatively featureless non-thermal emission continuum over the entire electromagnetic range. This lack of spectral lines historically hindered identification of the nature and distance of such objects.

In the unified scheme of radio-loud active galactic nuclei, the observed nuclear phenomenology of BL Lacs is interpreted as being due to the effects of the relativistic jet closely aligned to the line of sight of the observer. BL Lacs are thought to be intrinsically identical to low-power radio galaxies. These active nuclei appear to be hosted in massive elliptical galaxies. From the point of AGN classification, BL Lacs are a blazar subtype. All known BL Lacs are associated with core dominated radio sources, many of them exhibiting apparent superluminal motion.

The blazar category encompasses all quasars oriented with the relativistic jet directed at the observer giving a unique radio emission spectrum. This includes BL Lacs as well as optically violent variable (OVV) quasars, however in general practice, &quot;Blazar&quot; and &quot;BL Lac Object&quot; are often used interchangeably. OVV quasars are generally more luminous and have stronger emission lines than BL Lac objects.

Some examples of BL Lac objects are BL Lacertae itself, OJ 287, AP Librae, PKS 2155-304, PKS 0521-365, Markarian 421, 3C 371, W Comae Berenices, ON 325 and Markarian 501.

==Host galaxies==

Soon after the discovery of this unusual class of objects it was noted that the sources were surrounded by a faint nebulosity. In the late 1970s the use of modern detectors (such as CCD) allowed observers to probe with better accuracy the nature of the nebulosity. First images of the BL Lac object PKS 0548-322 by Michael John Disney in 1974 in various filters found it to be composed by a giant elliptical galaxy with a bright nucleus.

Extensive surveys taken with the Hubble Space Telescope of 132 BL Lac objects comprising seven complete radio, X-ray, and optically selected samples in 2000 studied the morphologies of possible BL Lac host galaxies. The data concluded that in two-thirds of the BLL images taken, host galaxies are detected, including in nearly all with redshift z &lt; 0.5. BL Lac objects are luminous enough that only one quarter (6/22) of the images taken with z &gt; 0.5 were resolved because of relatively short exposure times. A de Vaucouleurs profile formula_1 looks to be a significantly preferred brightness profile for 58 of the 72 resolved host galaxies at over ~99% confidence. The results of this survey conclude that there is an 8% limit to the number of disk systems in BL Lac objects and is therefore consistent with the assumption that all BL Lac host galaxies could be elliptical. These ellipticals are very luminous with a median absolute K-corrected magnitude of formula_2 mag (rms dispersion). This is comparable to the brightest cluster galaxies.

==History==

John L. Schmitt first noticed the peculiar nature of BL Lac in 1968 when he matched it with a radio object, VRO 42.22.01.

Within a year others observed that the radio flux varied, and that light was polarized. Peter Albert Strittmatter proposed the class of object in 1972 and added four objects. By 1976 there were 30 known objects.

In 2017, a very high energy neutrino was detected by the IceCube project apparently coming from BL Lac object TXS 0506+056.

<text>Angular resolution describes the ability of any image-forming device such as an optical or radio telescope, a microscope, a camera, or an eye, to distinguish small details of an object, thereby making it a major determinant of image resolution. It is used in optics applied to light waves, in antenna theory applied to radio waves, and in acoustics applied to sound waves. The colloquial use of the term &quot;resolution&quot; sometimes causes confusion; when an optical system is said to have a high resolution or high angular resolution, it means that the perceived distance, or actual angular distance, between resolved neighboring objects is small. The value that quantifies this property, &quot;θ,&quot; which is given by the Rayleigh criterion, is low for a system with a high resolution. The closely related term spatial resolution refers to the precision of a measurement with respect to space, which is directly connected to angular resolution in imaging instruments. The Rayleigh criterion shows that the minimum angular spread that can be resolved by an image-forming system is limited by diffraction to the ratio of the wavelength of the waves to the aperture width. For this reason, high-resolution imaging systems such as astronomical telescopes, long distance telephoto camera lenses and radio telescopes have large
==Definition of terms==

&quot;Resolving power&quot; is the ability of an imaging device to separate (i.e., to see as distinct) points of an object that are located at a small angular distance or it is the power of an optical instrument to separate far away objects, that are close together, into individual images. The term &quot;resolution&quot; or &quot;minimum resolvable distance&quot; is the minimum distance between distinguishable objects in an image, although the term is loosely used by many users of microscopes and telescopes to describe resolving power. As explained below, diffraction-limited resolution is defined by the Rayleigh criterion as the angular separation of two point sources when the maximum of each source lies in the first minimum of the diffraction pattern (Airy disk) of the other. In scientific analysis, in general, the term &quot;resolution&quot; is used to describe the precision with which any instrument measures and records (in an image or spectrum) any variable in the specimen or sample under study.

==The Rayleigh criterion==


The imaging system&#x27;s resolution can be limited either by aberration or by diffraction causing blurring of the image. These two phenomena have different origins and are unrelated. Aberrations can be explained by geometrical optics and can in principle be solved by increasing the optical quality of the system. On the other hand, diffraction comes from the wave nature of light and is determined by the finite aperture of the optical elements. The lens&#x27; circular aperture is analogous to a two-dimensional version of the single-slit experiment. Light passing through the lens interferes with itself creating a ring-shape diffraction pattern, known as the Airy pattern, if the wavefront of the transmitted light is taken to be spherical or plane over the exit aperture.

The interplay between diffraction and aberration can be characterised by the point spread function (PSF). The narrower the aperture of a lens the more likely the PSF is dominated by diffraction. In that case, the angular resolution of an optical system can be estimated (from the diameter of the aperture and the wavelength of the light) by the Rayleigh criterion defined by Lord Rayleigh: two point sources are regarded as just resolved when the principal diffraction maximum (center) of the Airy disk of one image coincides with the first minimum of the Airy disk of the other, as shown in the accompanying photos. (In the bottom photo on the right that shows the Rayleigh criterion limit, the central maximum of one point source might look as though it lies outside the first minimum of the other, but examination with a ruler verifies that the two do intersect.) If the distance is greater, the two points are well resolved and if it is smaller, they are regarded as not resolved. Rayleigh defended this criterion on sources of equal strength.

Considering diffraction through a circular aperture, this translates into:
:formula_1
where &quot;θ&quot; is the &quot;angular resolution&quot; (radians), &quot;λ&quot; is the wavelength of light, and &quot;D&quot; is the diameter of the lens&#x27; aperture. The factor 1.22 is derived from a calculation of the position of the first dark circular ring surrounding the central Airy disc of the diffraction pattern. This number is more precisely 1.21966989... (), the first zero of the order-one Bessel function of the first kind formula_2 divided by π.

The formal Rayleigh criterion is close to the empirical resolution limit found earlier by the English astronomer W. R. Dawes, who tested human observers on close binary stars of equal brightness. The result, &quot;θ&quot; = 4.56/&quot;D&quot;, with &quot;D&quot; in inches and &quot;θ&quot; in arcseconds, is slightly narrower than calculated with the Rayleigh criterion. A calculation using Airy discs as point spread function shows that at Dawes&#x27; limit there is a 5% dip between the two maxima, whereas at Rayleigh&#x27;s criterion there is a 26.3% dip. Modern image processing techniques including deconvolution of the point spread function allow resolution of binaries with even less angular separation.

Using a small-angle approximation, the angular resolution may be converted into a &quot;spatial resolution&quot;, Δ&quot;ℓ&quot;, by multiplication of the angle (in radians) with the distance to the object. For a microscope, that distance is close to the focal length &quot;f&quot; of the objective. For this case, the Rayleigh criterion reads:
:formula_3.

This is the radius, in the imaging plane, of the smallest spot to which a collimated beam of light can be focused, which also corresponds to the size of the smallest object that the lens can resolve. The size is proportional to wavelength, &quot;λ&quot;, and thus, for example, blue light can be focused to a smaller spot than red light. If the lens is focusing a beam of light with a finite extent (e.g., a laser beam), the value of &quot;D&quot; corresponds to the diameter of the light beam, not the lens. Since the spatial resolution is inversely proportional to &quot;D&quot;, this leads to the slightly surprising result that a wide beam of light may be focused on a smaller spot than a narrow one. This result is related to the Fourier properties of a lens.

A similar result holds for a small sensor imaging a subject at infinity: The angular resolution can be converted to a spatial resolution on the sensor by using &quot;f&quot; as the distance to the image sensor; this relates the spatial resolution of the image to the f-number, #:
:formula_4.
Since this is the radius of the Airy disk, the resolution is better estimated by the diameter, formula_5

==Specific cases==
===Single telescope===

Point-like sources separated by an angle smaller than the angular resolution cannot be resolved. A single optical telescope may have an angular resolution less than one arcsecond, but astronomical seeing and other atmospheric effects make attaining this very hard.

The angular resolution &quot;R&quot; of a telescope can usually be approximated by
:formula_6
where &quot;λ&quot; is the wavelength of the observed radiation, and &quot;D&quot; is the diameter of the telescope&#x27;s objective. The resulting &quot;R&quot; is in radians. For example, in the case of yellow light with a wavelength of 580 nm, for a resolution of 0.1 arc second, we need D=1.2 m. Sources larger than the angular resolution are called extended sources or diffuse sources, and smaller sources are called point sources.

This formula, for light with a wavelength of about 562 nm, is also called the Dawes&#x27; limit.

===Telescope array===
The highest angular resolutions for telescopes can be achieved by arrays of telescopes called astronomical interferometers: These instruments can achieve angular resolutions of 0.001 arcsecond at optical wavelengths, and much higher resolutions at x-ray wavelengths. In order to perform aperture synthesis imaging, a large number of telescopes are required laid out in a 2-dimensional arrangement with a dimensional precision better than a fraction (0.25x) of the required image resolution.

The angular resolution &quot;R&quot; of an interferometer array can usually be approximated by
:formula_7
where &quot;λ&quot; is the wavelength of the observed radiation, and &quot;B&quot; is the length of the maximum physical separation of the telescopes in the array, called the baseline. The resulting &quot;R&quot; is in radians. Sources larger than the angular resolution are called extended sources or diffuse sources, and smaller sources are called point sources.

For example, in order to form an image in yellow light with a wavelength of 580 nm, for a resolution of 1 milli-arcsecond, we need telescopes laid out in an array that is 120 m × 120 m with a dimensional precision better than 145 nm.

===Microscope===
The resolution &quot;R&quot; (here measured as a distance, not to be confused with the angular resolution of a previous subsection) depends on the angular aperture formula_8:

:formula_9 where formula_10.

Here NA is the numerical aperture, formula_11 is half the included angle formula_8 of the lens, which depends on the diameter of the lens and its focal length, formula_13 is the refractive index of the medium between the lens and the specimen, and formula_14 is the wavelength of light illuminating or emanating from (in the case of fluorescence microscopy) the sample.

It follows that the NAs of both the objective and the condenser should be as high as possible for maximum resolution. In the case that both NAs are the same, the equation may be reduced to:
:formula_15

The practical limit for formula_11 is about 70°. In a dry objective or condenser, this gives a maximum NA of 0.95. In a high-resolution oil immersion lens, the maximum NA is typically 1.45, when using immersion oil with a refractive index of 1.52. Due to these limitations, the resolution limit of a light microscope using visible light is about 200 nm. Given that the shortest wavelength of visible light is violet (formula_17),

:formula_18

which is near 200 nm.

Oil immersion objectives can have practical difficulties due to their shallow depth of field and extremely short working distance, which calls for the use of very thin (0.17 mm) cover slips, or, in an inverted microscope, thin glass-bottomed Petri dishes.

However, resolution below this theoretical limit can be achieved using super-resolution microscopy. These include optical near-fields (Near-field scanning optical microscope) or a diffraction technique called 4Pi STED microscopy. Objects as small as 30 nm have been resolved with both techniques. In addition to this Photoactivated localization microscopy can resolve structures of that size, but is also able to give information in z-direction (3D).
