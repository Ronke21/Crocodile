<text>Huddersfield Town Association Football Club is a professional association football club based in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, England. They compete in , the third level of the English football league system. 

Huddersfield Town were founded on 15 August 1908. They competed in the North Eastern League and Midland League, before gaining admittance to the Football League in 1910. They were promoted out of the Second Division in 1919–20 and went on to win the FA Cup in 1922, having been beaten finalists in 1920. Under the management of Herbert Chapman, Huddersfield were crowned league champions in three successive seasons: 1923–24, 1924–25 and 1925–26. They played on the losing side in three more FA Cup finals: 1928, 1930 and 1938. They were relegated from the First Division after 32 years in 1952, though secured an immediate promotion the following season. Relegated again in 1956, they won the Second Division title at the end of the 1969–70 season, though were relegated three times in four years by 1975.

Huddersfield won the Fourth Division in 1979–80 and were promoted from the Third Division in 1982–83. Relegated in 1988, they were beaten in the 1994 final of the Football League Trophy, though returned to Wembley the following year to win the third tier&#x27;s play-off final. They returned to the fourth tier in 2003 following a second relegation in three years. Huddersfield reached the Premier League with three successful play-off campaigns: from Division Three in 2004, from League One in 2012, and then from the Championship in 2017. They spent two seasons in the Premier League, before being relegated in 2019. They were relegated from the Championship in 2024.

The team have played home games at the Kirklees Stadium (currently known as the John Smith&#x27;s Stadium due to sponsorship) since moving from Leeds Road in 1994. The club colours of blue and white stripes were adopted in 1913. Their nickname, &quot;The Terriers&quot;, was taken in 1969. Huddersfield&#x27;s current emblem is based on the town&#x27;s coat of arms. The team have long-standing West Yorkshire derby rivalries with Bradford City and Leeds United.

==History==

=== Early years and golden days (1908–1945) ===
The club was founded in 1908. The founders bought a site on Leeds Road for £500, and joined the North Eastern League. The following season they joined the Midland Football League in order to reduce travelling costs. In an effort to gain entry into the Football League, the club invited Scottish architect Archibald Leitch to reconstruct Leeds Road. A 4,000-seat stand was to be constructed, and terracing was also planned, to provide an overall capacity of 34,000. After the plans went through, Huddersfield directors successfully applied to become members of the Football League in 1910, and development of Leeds Road began immediately. However, the development costs were too high, and attendances sunk below 7,000. Huddersfield went into liquidation in 1912, after which a new limited company was formed to take over the club&#x27;s assets.

Huddersfield Town were reportedly £25,000 in debt in 1919, and attendances fell to around 3,000. Chairman John Hilton Crowther planned to merge Town with newly formed Leeds United and to relocate to Leeds. The reports galvanised supporters to start fundraising to stave off the move. Shares of £1 had been released, converting the club to a public ownership. After a month of acquiring funds and negotiations, the club stayed in Huddersfield. The team then reached the 1920 FA Cup final and won promotion to First Division for the first time.

During their first season in the top flight, former Leeds City manager Herbert Chapman was brought in (after Huddersfield helped him overturn his ban) as the new assistant to Ambrose Langley. Chapman replaced Langley in March 1921, and led the team to a 17th-place finish. In the summer of 1921, playmaker Clem Stephenson and the club&#x27;s all-time top goal scorer George Brown were acquired. Chapman&#x27;s tactics were based upon the principles of a strong defence and a fast, counter-attacking response, with the focus on quick, short passing and mazy runs from his wingers. He is regarded as the first manager to successfully employ the counter-attack. Other progressive ideas included a disciplined fitness regime for the players, and the practice of reserve and youth teams playing the same style as the senior team. He employed a wide-ranging scouting network to find the right players for his tactical system.
The team won their first ever major honour, the FA Cup, after Preston North End were beaten 1–0 in the 1922 FA Cup final. Huddersfield also won the 1922 Charity Shield, defeating Liverpool 1–0. Town finished in third place in 1922–23, before winning their first ever First Division championship in 1923–24. The team fought off Cardiff City, although it was by the narrowest of margins. They both finished on 57 points, but Huddersfield won it by a difference of 0.024 in goal average. Huddersfield won 3–0 against Nottingham Forest in the last match, and Cardiff drew 0–0 at Birmingham City and missed a penalty.

The team retained their First Division title in 1924–25 after only one loss in the last 27 league matches. Huddersfield only conceded 28 goals and never conceded more than two per game; the first time a team accomplished this feat. Another notable feat was achieved in October 1924, as Billy Smith became the first player in history to score directly from a corner. After winning successive league titles, Chapman left for Arsenal, which offered to double his wages and attracted larger crowds than Huddersfield. Cecil Potter was brought in as his successor. Under Potter, Town became the first club to win three successive English League titles in 1925–26. The team came close to winning a fourth consecutive title the following season, but only won one of their last seven matches and thus handed the title to Newcastle United. Town won the &quot;wrong double&quot; in the 1927–28 season; they finished runners-up in both the league and lost the FA Cup final.

In March 1928, an international match between England and Scotland featured five Town players. Tom Wilson, Bob Kelly, Billy Smith, and Roy Goodall started for England; Alex Jackson played for Scotland. Jackson scored a hat-trick as Scotland, later nicknamed &quot;The Wembley Wizards&quot;, defeated England 5–1.

Huddersfield&#x27;s ageing squad was not adequately replaced. A deterioration of their league position followed, although they finished runners-up in 1933–34, and two more FA Cup Finals were reached under new manager Clem Stephenson. Town were defeated in 1930 by Chapman&#x27;s Arsenal, and in 1938 by Preston North End after extra time, which was the first FA Cup final to be broadcast on television. A record home attendance of 67,037 was achieved in 1932 during an FA Cup sixth round tie against Arsenal.

=== Decline and recovery (1945–1992) ===

Town were relegated for the first time in the 1951–52 season. Stockport County manager Andy Beattie was appointed in April 1952, and managed Stockport and Huddersfield in three divisions in the same month. He also had two horseshoes nailed to his office wall for luck. The team finished second in the Second Division in 1952–53 and made an immediate return. They finished in third place in their first season back in the top flight. After Town were relegated in 1955–56, Beattie resigned as manager in November 1956, and Bill Shankly succeeded him. In December 1957, the team led 5–1 with 30 minutes remaining against Charlton Athletic, but lost 7–6. Shankly left in December 1959 to manage Liverpool.

Floodlights were installed at Leeds Road in 1961, which were financed by the British record transfer fee of £55,000 of Denis Law to Manchester City, and became known as the &quot;Denis Law Lights&quot;.

Huddersfield continued to play in the second tier during the 1960s. They reached the semi-final of the League Cup in 1967–68, but lost on aggregate to Arsenal. In 1969, the club adopted the nickname &quot;The Terriers&quot;. Town won the Second Division in 1969–70 under the guidance of Ian Greaves. The team stayed up in their first season back in the first tier, but were relegated in 1971–72, which was followed by another relegation to the Third Division for the first time the season after. Huddersfield were relegated to the Fourth Division for the first time in 1974–75. The 1974–75 season also saw Huddersfield Town field a black player for the first time with Lloyd Maitland making his first team debut on 8 February 1974 against Hereford United. Former Town manager Tom Johnston returned to the club as general manager in 1975. The club later returned to all-blue shirts that he had introduced in the mid-1960s. Johnston replaced Bobby Collins as manager in December 1975. During the 1976–77 season, John Haselden became the manager with Johnston returning to his previous role. This, however, did not last, as Johnston demoted Haselden in September 1977 and gave himself the job. He managed Town to their lowest ever league position of 11th at the end of the 1977–78 season.

A recovery started under manager Mick Buxton, who was appointed in 1978. Huddersfield won the Fourth Division in 1979–80, scoring 101 goals in the process. Town finished just outside the promotion places the following season. The team won promotion to the Second Division in 1982–83 by a third-place finish. Due to Huddersfield languishing at the bottom of the division, declining home attendances, and the resulting financial pressure, Buxton was sacked in December 1986. Steve Smith succeeded him, and became the first (and as of 2025, only) permanent manager in the club&#x27;s history to hail from Huddersfield. The team stayed up by three points that season, but were relegated back to the third tier in 1987–88. Town only won six matches, conceded 100 goals, and lost 10–1 against Manchester City. Huddersfield reached the 1991–92 Third Division play-offs, but lost the semi-final against Peterborough United by an aggregate score of 4–3.

=== New stadium, near extinction, and a return to the top flight (1992–2019) ===

The team avoided relegation to the Third Division (renamed from the Fourth Division after the introduction of the Premier League) in 1992–93, following a run of only three defeats in their last 17 league games, to finish in 15th place. Manager Neil Warnock took over from Ian Ross for the 1993–94 season. Town reached the 1994 Football League Trophy final, but lost against Swansea City on penalties.

Huddersfield Town played their final match at Leeds Road on 30 April 1994, beating Blackpool 2–1, which was watched by a near capacity crowd of 16,195. They moved into the new Kirklees Stadium (then named as the Alfred McAlpine Stadium) for the 1994–95 season. During the first season at the new stadium, Huddersfield were promoted to the second tier via the play-offs after a 2–1 win against Bristol Rovers at Wembley. Warnock left the club that summer, and was replaced by Brian Horton, who guided the Town to an eighth-place finish the following season.

Horton was sacked in October 1997, with Huddersfield without a win in their first nine games. Former Huddersfield player Peter Jackson was given the job. They only scored one point in Jackson&#x27;s first five games, but Huddersfield finally won in their 15th match, by beating Stoke City 3–1. Unbeaten runs mixed with winless runs followed, and Town managed to stay up by a 16th-place finish.

In January 1999, the club was bought by local businessman Barry Rubery, who targeted to reach the Premier League. Steve Bruce succeeded Jackson in May 1999. Huddersfield topped the table in December, but their form plummeted after striker Marcus Stewart was sold in the January transfer window to First Division rivals Ipswich Town. They finished the season in eighth place, just outside the play-offs. Bruce was sacked in October 2000. Rubery accused Bruce of &quot;wasting £3 million&quot;, arguing that the money would have been &quot;spent more wisely by a more experienced manager without an ego to feed&quot;. He was replaced by Lou Macari, who was unable to halt the slide as relegation to the third tier followed at the end of the season. Huddersfield reached the play-offs in 2001–02, but lost 2–1 to Brentford in the semi-final.

Around this time, the club had debts of 20 million pounds following relegation and the collapse of ITV Digital. The players went months without being paid, and manager Mick Wadsworth was sacked in January 2003, only to be reinstated because the club did not have any money for his pay-off. Wadsworth was eventually sacked in March and replaced by Mel Machin, who oversaw relegation to the fourth tier. The club was put into administration, but Ken Davy bought the club in the summer of 2003 and rescued Town from liquidation. Manager Peter Jackson only had four senior players on the books before the beginning of the 2003–04 season, after which many youngsters from the academy setup were added. Huddersfield finished in a surprising fourth place, and defeated Mansfield Town in the play-off final to return to the third tier.
The team reached the play-offs in 2005–06, but were eliminated by Barnsley in the semi-final, after further seasons in League One followed. Dean Hoyle took over as chairman, and majority shareholder, of the club in June 2009. Town reached the play-offs in 2009–10 under manager Lee Clark, but lost against Millwall in the semi-final. The team again qualified for the play-offs the following season, however, Peterborough United were victorious in the final. Huddersfield set a Football League record of 43 matches unbeaten (not including the play-off matches), which was previously set by Nottingham Forest, in November 2011. Clark was sacked in February 2012 following a 1–0 home defeat to Sheffield United, and was replaced by former Leeds United manager Simon Grayson. He led Town to the play-off final against Sheffield United. The game finished 0–0 after extra time, before Huddersfield were victorious after 22 penalties (8–7).

Despite this success, Grayson was sacked in January 2013, being succeeded by Mark Robins. Huddersfield avoided relegation on the last day, after a draw with Barnsley. German Borussia Dortmund II coach David Wagner became the first person born outside the British Isles to manage the club in November 2015. He implemented the &quot;Gegenpressing&quot; style of play. In 2016–17, Town finished fifth with a negative goal difference, and qualified for the play-offs. After defeating Sheffield Wednesday on penalties in the semi-final, they faced Reading in the final. Another penalty shoot-out followed, and Huddersfield were again victorious. Promotion to the Premier League meant a return to the first tier for the first time since 1972. Huddersfield also became the second club, after Blackpool, to have won all three divisional play-offs.

The team finished 16th in the Premier League in the 2017–18 season and stayed up, but were relegated after a 20th-place finish in 2018–19. Wagner left the club by mutual consent in January 2019, and was replaced by Borussia Dortmund II manager Jan Siewert, but Town were relegated in March with six matches remaining. The team amassed only three wins and 16 points by the end of the season.

=== Championship years and two new owners (2019–present) ===
Chairman Hoyle announced his departure in May 2019, selling the club to businessman Phil Hodgkinson, relinquishing the post due to poor health. Siewert was replaced by Lincoln City manager Danny Cowley in September of that year, who guided the club to survival in the Championship before being sacked. Leeds United assistant coach Carlos Corberán was appointed as the club&#x27;s new head coach in July 2020.

Huddersfield finished third in the EFL Championship and met fourth placed Nottingham Forest in the 2022 EFL Championship play-off final at Wembley, losing 1–0; Town were denied two penalty claims by referee Jonathan Moss in his last game before retirement. In the first instance, the video assistant referee did not overturn Moss&#x27;s decision despite apparent contact between Forest&#x27;s Jack Colback and Huddersfield&#x27;s Harry Toffolo.

Corberán left in July 2022, shortly before the 2022–23 Championship season, and joined Olympiacos in Greece. Former Town player Danny Schofield was appointed as the new head coach, but was dismissed 10 weeks later after a poor start to the new season, to be replaced by Hertha BSC assistant coach Mark Fotheringham. He lasted only four months and was sacked on 8 February 2023, being replaced by Neil Warnock five days later. His return to the John Smiths stadium saw a 2–1 win against Birmingham on 18 February 2023 and he was quoted as saying he had &#x27;tears in his eyes&#x27; due to the reception he received from the fans.

On 23 March 2023, Huddersfield announced the club&#x27;s takeover by an unnamed North American group after Dean Hoyle, who returned to the club in 2020, acquired 100% of its shares and then sold them. The deal was subject to &quot;legislative and governance procedures&quot;, and involved Hoyle writing off £40 million of debt to keep the club, sitting 22nd in the Championship, out of administration. On 28 March 2023, the club revealed the bid was from El Dorado Hills, California (United States) investor and owner of USL Championship side Sacramento Republic, Kevin M. Nagle; the deal was completed in June 2023.

A 1–0 home victory against already-promoted Sheffield United on 4 May 2023 confirmed Huddersfield&#x27;s safety. However, Huddersfield continued to struggle in the 2023–24 season, parting company with Warnock in September 2023, then appointing Darren Moore as manager, but sacking him in January 2024, after just three wins in 23 matches, with the club 21st in the second tier and three points above the relegation places. Moore was replaced by Andre Breitenreiter on 15 February 2024. The club ended the season in 23rd place, resulting in relegation to League One. Breitenreiter left the club by mutual consent and was replaced by Michael Duff.

==Badge and colours==

The club spent years debating what colour the kit should be, with suggestions ranging from salmon pink to plain white or all-blue to white with blue yoke. Eventually, in 1913, the club adopted the striped blue and white jersey that remains to this day.

The club badge is based on the coat of arms of Huddersfield. Town first used a badge on its shirts for the 1920 FA Cup Final based on the Huddersfield coat of arms. It appeared again with a Yorkshire Rose for the 1922 FA Cup Final and again for the finals of 1928, 1930 and 1938. The club&#x27;s main colours of blue and white are evident throughout the badge both in the mantling and in the shield, in the form of stripes. Two Yorkshire Roses and Castle Hill form part of the history of the club and the area.

Town stuck with the same principal design (blue and white stripes) until 1966, when Scottish manager Tom Johnston introduced all-blue shirts. A new badge was also adopted that year, when the vertical monogram &quot;HTFC&quot; adorned the all-blue shirts. When the club adopted the nickname &quot;The Terriers&quot; for the 1969–70 season, the blue and white stripes returned and with it a red terrier with the words &quot;The Terriers&quot;.

After relegation to the Fourth Division, Huddersfield returned to all-blue shirts and the vertical monogram crest with the return of Tom Johnston in 1975. Stripes returned in the 1977–78 season and have been the club&#x27;s home kit ever since. In 1980, Town adopted what remains their badge today. It combined elements of the old town coat of arms with modern motifs, such as blue and white stripes and a terrier with a football.

In 2000, Huddersfield changed its badge to a circular design, but that was never popular with the fans, and soon returned to the heraldic-style badge. The badge was further redeveloped with a small adaptation in 2005. The club took the decision to remove &quot;A.F.C.&quot; from the text, leaving only the wording &quot;Huddersfield Town&quot;. This eased problems with embroidery on shirts and club merchandise, and also gave the printwork a standard look.

The club adopted a Terriers logo in 2018. It was used solely on the strip and did not replace the heraldic crest, which continued to appear on all official media and documents. In 2019, Town agreed to have Paddy Power shirt sponsorship in a striking beauty queen style diagonal sash design. Within days, the club were contacted by The Football Association for their &quot;observations&quot; about the kit. Shortly after, it was revealed that the shirt was a prank envisioned by Paddy Power, and that the club would play in shirts without a sponsor. as part of their &quot;Save Our Shirt&quot; campaign.

Huddersfield returned to an updated version of their heraldic-style crest in 2019. The three stars (representing their hat-trick of league titles in the 1920s) were moved inside the shield. Furthermore, a single Yorkshire Rose was placed at the top of the blue and white stripes, above the three stars. The shield was also modernized by moving away from the more rounded version. The Terrier was incorporated into the crest, at the top of the shield, and the club&#x27;s founding date was introduced on either side of Castle Hill.

Huddersfield were the first team to have played at each of the four professional levels of English football at two different grounds.

== Supporters and rivalries ==
Since 1920, Huddersfield&#x27;s club song has been &quot;Smile A While&quot;. The anthem was created by G. W. Chappell of Longwood, Huddersfield, before the 1920 FA Cup Final against Aston Villa. It was an adapted version of the popular First World War song &quot;Till We Meet Again&quot;. Chappell&#x27;s creation was originally called &quot;The Town Anthem&quot;, and was sung by Town supporters ahead of the Final. The anthem is still sung by Huddersfield supporters at home matches.

In 2014, a group of Town fans formed a collective called &quot;North Stand Loyal&quot;. Its aim was &quot;to improve the atmosphere around the stadium on matchdays&quot;, and the members were &quot;inspired by fan groups of continental Europe and other parts of the world&quot;. In 2017, the group renamed themselves &quot;Cowshed Loyal&quot;. The group is located in the South Stand, which is shared with away fans.

The club also has various overseas supporters&#x27; groups, with clubs in Australia, Canada, Northern Ireland, Norway, Republic of Ireland, Singapore, Slovakia, and United States. Notable fans over the years have included Prime Minister Harold Wilson, who was born in the town, and actor Sir Patrick Stewart, who became president of the Huddersfield Town Academy in 2010.

Huddersfield Town&#x27;s main rivals are considered to be West Yorkshire clubs Bradford City and Leeds United. Town hold the better head-to-head record against City; 21 matches have been won, 17 drawn, and 14 lost. Including games against United&#x27;s predecessor team Leeds City, Huddersfield have won 36 of the 90 derbies between the two sides, with 20 draws and 34 Leeds wins.

There are smaller rivalries with South Yorkshire clubs Barnsley and Sheffield Wednesday, and there is a Roses rivalry with Oldham Athletic. Huddersfield also have a rivalry with Cambridgeshire club Peterborough United, largely fuelled by the play-off meetings in 1992 and 2011, as well as a similar rivalry with Nottingham Forest, due to their controversial defeat in the 2022 EFL Championship Play-Off Final.

<text>The helots (; , &quot;heílotes&quot;) were a population that constituted a majority of the population of Laconia and Messenia – the territories ruled by Sparta. There has been controversy since antiquity as to their exact characteristics, such as whether they constituted an Ancient Greek tribe, a social class, or both. For example, Critias described helots as &quot;slaves to the utmost&quot;, whereas according to Pollux, they occupied a status &quot;between free men and slaves&quot;. Tied to the land, they primarily worked in agriculture as a majority and economically supported the Spartan citizens.

The proportion of helots in relation to Spartan citizens varied throughout the history of the Spartan state; according to Herodotus, there were seven helots for each of the 5,000 Spartan soldiers at the time of the Battle of Plataea in 479 BC. Thus the need to keep the helot population in check and to prevent rebellion were major concerns of the Spartans. Helots were ritually mistreated and humiliated. Every autumn the Spartan polis declared war on the helots, allowing them to be killed and abused by members of the Crypteia without fear of religious repercussion. 
Uprisings and attempts to improve the lot of the helots did occur, such as the conspiracy of Cinadon of 399 BC. Plato on the other hand does not mention the killings by the Crypteia at all in &quot;Laws&quot;.

== Etymology ==
Several theories exist regarding the origin of the name &quot;helot&quot;. According to Hellanicus, the word relates to the village of Helos, in the south of Sparta. Pausanias thus states, &quot;Its inhabitants became the first slaves of the Lacedaemonian state, and were the first to be called helots&quot;. This explanation is, however, not very plausible in etymological terms.

Linguists have associated the word with the root , &quot;wel-&quot;, as in , &quot;halískomai&quot;, &quot;to be captured, to be made prisoner&quot;. In fact, some ancient authors did not consider the term ethnic, but rather an indication of servitude: Antiochus of Syracuse writes: &quot;those of the Lacedaemonians who did not take part in the expedition were adjudged slaves and were named helots&quot;, while Theopompus (fragment 122), cited by Athenaeus (VI, 416c), states, &quot;...and the one nation called their slaves helots and the others called them penestae...&quot; &quot;In all of these texts, the naming of the group as helots is the central and symbolic moment of their reduction to serfhood. They are thus institutionally distinguished from the anonymous &quot;douloi&quot; (slaves).&quot;

Certainly conquest comprised one aspect of helotism; thus Messenians, who were conquered in the Messenian Wars of the 8th century BC, become synonymous in Herodotus with helots.

The situation seems less clear in the case of the earliest helots, who, according to Theopompus, were descended from the initial Achaeans, whom the Dorians had conquered. But not all Achaeans were reduced to helotism: the city of Amyclae, home of the Hyacinthia festival, enjoyed special status, as did others.

Contemporary authors propose alternative theories: according to Antiochus of Syracuse, helots were the Lacedaemonians who did not participate in the Messenian Wars; for Ephorus of Cyme, they were the &quot;perioeci&quot; (&quot;dwellers in surrounding communities&quot;) from Helos, reduced to slavery after a failed revolt.

== Characteristics ==

=== Relationship to Spartans ===
From at least the classical period, the number of Spartans was very small in comparison to that of the helots. In a celebrated passage, Thucydides stresses that &quot;most Spartan institutions have always been designed with a view to security against the Helots&quot;. Aristotle compares them to &quot;an enemy constantly sitting in wait of the disaster of the Spartans&quot;. Consequently, fear seems to be an important factor governing relations between Spartans and Helots. According to tradition, the Spartiates always carried their spears, undid the straps of their bucklers only when at home lest the Helots seize them, and locked themselves in their homes. They also took active measures, subjecting them to what Theopompus describes as &quot;an altogether cruel and bitter condition&quot;.

According to Myron of Priene, an anti-Spartan historian of the middle 3rd century BC:

Plutarch also states that Spartans treated the Helots &quot;harshly and cruelly&quot;: they compelled them to drink pure wine (which was considered dangerous—wine usually being diluted with water) &quot;... and to lead them in that condition into their public halls, that the children might see what a sight a drunken man is; they made them to dance low dances, and sing ridiculous songs...&quot; during syssitia (obligatory banquets). However, he notes that this rough treatment was inflicted only relatively late, after the 464 BC earthquake.

Some modern scholars advocate a reevaluation of ancient evidence about helots. It has been argued that the &quot;kunē&quot; was not actually made of dogskin, and that the &quot;diphthera&quot; (literally, &quot;leather&quot;) was the general attire of the poor peasant class. The obligation of masters to prevent fatness amongst their helots is actually deemed implausible: as the Spartiates lived separately, dietary intake could not be rigorously controlled; as manual labour was an important function of the Helots (for example, being used to carry their master&#x27;s arms and armour on campaign), it would make sense to keep them well fed. Besides, the rations mentioned by Thucydides for the Helots on Sphacteria are close to normal. Myron&#x27;s evidence is interpreted as an extrapolation from actions performed on symbolic representatives. In short, Grote writes that &quot;the various anecdotes which are told respecting [Helot] treatment at Sparta betoken less of cruelty than of ostentatious scorn&quot;. He has been followed recently by J. Ducat (1974 and 1990), who describes Spartan treatment of the Helots as a kind of ideological warfare, designed to condition the Helots to think of themselves as inferiors. This strategy seems to have been successful at least for Laconian Helots: when the Thebans ordered a group of Laconian helot prisoners to recite the verses of Alcman and Terpander (national poets of Thebes), they refused on the grounds that it would displease their masters.

Other modern scholars consider then, &quot;although the details may be fanciful, [Myron&#x27;s evidence] does reflect accurately the general Spartiate attitude towards helots&quot;. It has also been proposed that contempt alone could hardly explain the organized murder of Helots mentioned by several ancient sources. According to Aristotle, the ephors annually declared war on the Helots, thereby allowing Spartans to kill them without fear of religious pollution. This task was apparently given to the &quot;kryptes&quot;, graduates of the difficult &quot;agoge&quot; who took part in the crypteia. This lack of judicial protection is confirmed by Myron of Priene, who mentions killing as a standard mode of regulation of the Helot population. According to a passage in Thucydides, helots were massacred in a carefully staged event in 425 BC or earlier:
Thus Paul Cartledge claims that &quot;the history of Sparta (...) is fundamentally the history of the class struggle between the Spartans and the Helots&quot;.

=== Helots and &quot;klēroi&quot; ===
Helots were assigned to citizens to carry out domestic work or to work on their &quot;klēroi,&quot; or portions. The &quot;klēroi&quot; were the original divisions of Messenia after its conquest by Sparta. Various sources mention such servants accompanying this or that Spartan. Plutarch has Timaia, the wife of King Agis II, &quot;being herself forward enough to whisper among her helot maid-servants&quot; that the child she was expecting had been fathered by Alcibiades, and not her husband, indicating a certain level of trust. According to some authors, in the 4th century BC, citizens also used chattel-slaves for domestic purposes. However, this is disputed by others. Some helots were also servants to young Spartans during their &quot;agoge&quot;, the Spartan education; these were the μόθωνες / &quot;móthōnes&quot; (see below). Finally, helots, like slaves, could be artisans or tradesmen.
They were required to hand over a predetermined portion of their harvest ( / &quot;apophorá&quot;), with the helots keeping the surplus. According to Plutarch, this portion was 70 medimnoi of barley for a man, 12 for a woman, as well as a quantity of oil and wine corresponding to an amount reasonable for the needs of a warrior and his family, or a widow, respectively. The existence of the &quot;apophorá&quot; is contested by Tyrtaeus: &quot;Secondly, though no fixed tribute was imposed on them, they used to bring the half of all the produce of their fields to Sparta... Like asses worn by their great burdens, bringing of dire necessity to their masters the half of all the fruits the corn-land bears.&quot; Pausanias is describing the period immediately after the first Messenian War, when conditions were probably more severe. Also, since taking a percentage of the produce would have required constantly overseeing the helots, it is unlikely such a tax could be implemented upon the relatively distant Messenia. With Tyrtaeus being a poet, the amount might well have been a poetic figure of speech, similar to the modern &quot;half a kingdom&quot;. In fact, it is debated whether the quote refers to helots in the first place, since Tyrtaeus&#x27; description of the Second Messenian War refers to enemy phalanxes, indicating the first war could have ended with the Messenian people becoming a vassal state of Sparta rather than helots.

Having paid their tribute, the helots could often live rather well; the lands of Laconia and Messenia were very fertile, and often permitted two crops per year. It seems they could enjoy some private property: in 425 BC, some helots had their own boats. A certain amount of wealth was achievable: in 223 BC, 6,000 helots purchased their freedom for 500 drachmas each, a considerable sum at the time.

=== Demography ===
Helots lived in family units and could, at least &quot; de facto&quot;, contract unions among themselves. Since helots were much less susceptible than other slaves in Greek antiquity to having their family units dispersed, they could reproduce themselves, or at least maintain their number. Probably not insignificant to begin with, their population increased in spite of the &quot;crypteia&quot;, other massacres of helots (see below), and losses in war. Simultaneously, the population of Spartiate citizens declined.

The absence of a formal census prevents an accurate assessment of the helot population, but estimates are possible. According to Herodotus, helots were seven times as numerous as Spartans during the Battle of Plataea in 479 BC. The long Peloponnesian War drained Sparta of so many of its citizens that by the time of the conspiracy of Cinadon, the beginning of the 4th century BC, only forty Peers, or citizens, could be counted in a crowd of 4,000 at the agora (Xenophon, &quot;Hellenica&quot;, III, 3, 5). The total population of helots at that time, including women, is estimated as 170,000–224,000.

Since the helot population was not technically chattel, their population was reliant on native birth rates, as opposed to prisoners of war or purchased slaves. Helots were encouraged by the Spartans to impose a eugenics doctrine similar to that which they, themselves, practiced. This would, according to Greek beliefs of the period, ensure not only genetic but also acquired favourable characteristics be passed along to successive generations. Tempering these selective factors was the &quot;crypteia,&quot; during which the strongest and fittest helots were the primary targets of the &quot;kryptes&quot;; to select soft targets would be interpreted as a sign of weakness. This theoretically removed the strongest and most able potential rebels while keeping the general populace fit and efficient.

What is more, the Spartans used helot women to satisfy the state&#x27;s human personnel needs: the &#x27;bastards&#x27; (&quot;nothoi&quot;) born of Spartan fathers and helot women held an intermediary rank in Lacedaemonian society (cf. &quot;mothakes&quot; and &quot;mothones&quot; below) and swelled the ranks of the citizen army. It is difficult to determine whether these births were the results of voluntary liaisons (at least on the part of the father) or part of a formal state program. It is unknown what happened to girls born of such unions, as they served no military purpose. It is possible they were abandoned at birth and left to die, or lived to remain helots.

=== Emancipation ===
According to Myron of Priene, cited by Athenaeus, the emancipation of helots was &quot;common&quot; ( / &quot;pollákis&quot;). The text suggests that this is normally associated with completion of military service. The first explicit reference to this practice in regards to the helots occurs in Thucydides (IV, 26, 5). This is on the occasion of the events at Sphacteria, when Sparta had to relieve their hoplites, who were besieged on the island by the Athenians:

The fact was, that the Lacedaemonians had made advertisement for volunteers to carry into the island ground corn, wine, cheese, and any other food useful in a siege; high prices being offered, and freedom promised to any of the helots who should succeed in doing so.

Thucydides reports that the request met with some success, and the helots got supplies through to the besieged island. He does not mention whether or not the Spartans kept their word; it is possible that some of the helots later executed were part of the Sphacterian volunteers but later said they kept their word.

Another such call came during the Theban invasion of Laconia in one of the decisive battles of Peloponnese wars. Xenophon in &quot;Hellenica&quot; (VI, 5, 28) states that the authorities agreed to emancipate all the helots who volunteered. He then reports that more than 6,000 heeded the call, leading to some embarrassment for the Spartans, who were initially overwhelmed by the number. Xenophon states that the Spartans&#x27; fears were assuaged when they received aid from their allies and Boeotian mercenary forces.

All the same, in 424 BC, the 700 helots who served Brasidas in Chalcidice were emancipated, and they were henceforth known as the &quot;Brasidians&quot;. It was also possible to purchase freedom, or achieve it by undergoing the traditional Spartan education. Generally, emancipated helots were referred to as &quot;neodamodes&quot; ( / &quot;neodamōdeis&quot;): those who rejoined the / &quot;dễmos&quot; (Deme) of the Perioeci.

Moses Finley underscores that the fact helots could serve as hoplites constituted a grave flaw in the system. In effect, the hoplite system was a strict method of training to ensure that discipline was maintained in the phalanx. The Spartans gained considerable reputation as hoplites, due to tactical capabilities developed through constant training. In addition to this military aspect, to be a hoplite was a key characteristic of Greek citizenship.
To introduce helots to this system thus led to inevitable social conflict.

=== A special case: &quot;mothakes&quot; and &quot;mothones&quot; ===
Phylarchus mentions a class of men who were at the same time free and non-citizens: the / &quot;mothakes&quot;, who had undergone the &quot;&#x27;agoge&#x27;&quot;, the Spartan educational system. Classical historiography recognizes that the helots comprised a large portion of these &quot;mothakes&quot;. Nevertheless, this category poses a number of problems, firstly that of vocabulary.

The classical authors used a number of terms which appear to evoke similar concepts:
* / &quot;mothakes&quot;: a connotation of freedom, Phylarchos affirmed that they were free (&quot;eleutheroi&quot;), Claudius Aelianus (&quot;Varia Historia&quot;, 12, 43) that they could be citizens;
* / &quot;mothōnes&quot;: a connotation of servility, the word designates slaves born to the home;
* / &quot;trophimoi&quot;: pupils, adopted children, whom Plutarch classified among the &quot;xenoi&quot; (strangers);
* / &quot;syntrophoi&quot;: literally, &quot;they who were raised with&quot;, that is to say, milk-siblings, given by Phylarchus as equivalent to &quot;mothakes&quot;;
* / &quot;paratrephonoi&quot; : literally, &quot;those who were fed near you&quot;, signification rather different from the preceding (this word also applied to domestic animals).

The situation is somewhat complicated by a gloss of Hesychios of Alexandria which attests that &quot;mothakes&quot; were slave children ( / &quot;doũloi&quot;) raised at the same time as the children of citizens. Philologists resolve this quandary in two ways:

* they insist on reading / &quot;mothãnes&quot;, as a hapax for (Arnold J. Toynbee);
* the hypothesis that &quot;douloi&quot; has been interpolated by a copyist who confounded &quot;mothakes&quot; and &quot;mothônes&quot;.

In any case, the conclusion needs to be treated carefully:

* the &quot;mothônes&quot; were young servants charged with domestic tasks for young Spartans during their education (Aristotle, I, 633c); they remained slaves on reaching adulthood;
* the &quot;mothakes&quot; were an independent freeborn group of helots.

=== Helots as troops in conflict ===
Herodotus makes multiple accounts of Helots accompanying Spartans as servants and soldiers in battles such as Thermopylae and Plataea, often lightly equipped compared to their hoplite counterparts. In his reports on Plataea, he makes multiple accounts of Helots which accompanied the Spartans on the battlefield and made up the mass of the army. In Greek military practice, the standard depth of the army&#x27;s phalanx was eight men, having known this, Herodotus deducted that there was a soldier ratio of seven Helots to one Spartan at Plataea.

Historians have confirmed that Herodotus&#x27; accounts of both Helot and Spartan soldiers is exaggerated, it is however confirmed that Helots were present on the battlefield due to Herodotus alluding to a grave which was constructed for the Helots. Helots may have also had other roles at Plataea besides forming the ranks in battle, some historians believe that Helots were also designated with guarding supply lines for the armies.

== Helot revolts ==

===Pausanias&#x27;s plot===
The first helot attempt at revolt which is historically reported is that provoked by general Pausanias in the 5th century BC. Thucydides reports:
Besides, they were informed that he was even intriguing with the helots; and such indeed was the fact, for he promised them freedom and citizenship if they would join him in insurrection, and would help him to carry out his plans to the end.
These intrigues did not however lead to a helot uprising; Thucydides indeed implies that Pausanias was turned in by the helots (I, 132, 5 – &quot;...the evidence even of the helots themselves.&quot;) Perhaps the promises made by Pausanias were too generous to be believed by the helots; not even Brasidas, when he emancipated his helot volunteers, offered full citizenship.

===Massacre at Taenarus===
The massacre at Cape Taenarus, the promontory formed by the southernmost tip of Taygetus, is also reported by Thucydides:

The Lacedaemonians had once raised up some helot suppliants from the temple of Poseidon at Taenarus, led them away and slain them; for which they believe the great earthquake at Sparta to have been a retribution.
This affair, recalled by the Athenians in responding to a Spartan request to exile Pericles—who was an Alcmaeonid on his mother&#x27;s side—is not dated. Historians know only that it happened before the disastrous earthquake of 464 BC. Thucydides here is the only one to implicate the helots: Pausanias speaks rather about Lacedaemonians who had been condemned to death. Nor does the text allow us to conclude that this was a failed uprising of helots, only that there was an attempt at escape. Additionally, a helot revolt in Laconia is unlikely, and Messenians would not likely have taken refuge at Cape Taenarus.

===Third Messenian War===
The uprising coincident with the earthquake of 464 BC is soundly attested to, although Greek historians do not agree on the interpretation of this event.

According to Thucydides, the helots and perioeci of Thouria and Aithaia took advantage of the earthquake to revolt and establish a position on Mt. Ithome. He adds that most of the rebels were of Messenian ancestry—confirming the appeal of Ithome as a historical place of Messenian resistance—and focuses attention on the perioeci of Thouria, a city on the Messenian coast. Conversely, historians could deduce that a minority of the helots were Laconian, thus making this the one and only revolt of their history. Commentators such as Stephanus of Byzantium – writing around a thousand years later – suggest that this Aithaia was in Laconia, thus indicating a large-scale uprising in the region. The version of events given by Pausanias is similar.

Diodorus Siculus (XI, 63,4 – 64,1), probably influenced by Ephorus of Cyme, attributed the uprising equally to the Messenians and the helots. This version of events is supported by Plutarch.

Finally, some authors make responsibility for the uprising with the helots of Laconia. This is the case of Plutarch in his &quot;Life of Cimon&quot;: the helots of the Eurotas River valley want to use the earthquake to attack the Spartans whom they think are disarmed. The intervention of Archidamus II, who calls the Lacedaemonians to arms, simultaneously saves them from the earthquake and the helot attack. The helots fold, but revert to open warfare joined by the Messenians.

It is difficult to reconcile these versions. It is nevertheless clear that in any case the revolt of 464 BC represented a major traumatic event for the Spartans. Plutarch indicates that the Crypteia and other poor treatments of the helots were instituted after this revolt. If there is any doubt in these affirmations, they at least underscore the immediate Spartan reaction: gathering allies and pursuing war with the same Athens that would later be faced in the Peloponnesian War. After all, the rebellion represented an early indication of souring relations between the Athenians and the Spartans. The Spartans spuriously expelled an Athenian army sent to assist in putting down the rebellion, and the Athenians assisted in the resettlement of helots in the town of Naupactus on the coast across the Gulf of Corinth from the Peloponnese.

===Athenian outposts===
During the same war and after the capitulation of the Spartans besieged in Sphacteria, the Athenians installed a garrison in Pylos composed of Messenians from Naupactus. Thucydides underlines that they had hoped to exploit the patriotism of the latter in order to pacify the region. Though the Messenians may not have triggered full-blown guerrilla warfare, they nevertheless pillaged the area and encouraged helot desertion. Sparta was forced to dedicate a garrison to controlling this activity; this was the first of the / &quot;epiteikhismoí&quot; (&quot;ramparts&quot;), outposts planted by the Athenians in enemy territory.

The second such outpost was at Kythera. This time, the Athenians set their sights on the helots of Laconia. Again, pillaging and desertion did occur, but not on the scale hoped for by the Athenians or feared by the Spartans: there was no uprising like that which accompanied the earthquake.

<doc id="236236" wikidata="Q128168" url="?curid=236236" title="Counter-Reformation">
<text>The Counter-Reformation (), also sometimes called the Catholic Revival, was the period of Catholic resurgence that was initiated in response to, and as an alternative to, the Protestant Reformations at the time. It is frequently dated to have begun with the Council of Trent (1545–1563) and to end with the political conclusion of the European wars of religion in 1648, though this is controversial. The broader term Catholic Reformation () also encompasses reforms and movements within the Church in the periods immediately before Protestantism or Trent and lasting later.

Initiated in part to address the challenges of the Protestant Reformations, the Counter-Reformation was a comprehensive effort arising from the decrees of the Council of Trent. The effort produced apologetic and polemical documents, anti-corruption efforts, spiritual movements, the promotion of new religious orders, and the flourishing of new art and musical styles. Such policies (e.g., by the Imperial Diets of the Holy Roman Empire) had long-lasting effects in European history with exiles of Protestants continuing until the 1781 Patent of Toleration, although smaller expulsions took place in the 19th century.

Such reforms included the foundation of seminaries for the proper training of priests in the spiritual life and the theological traditions of the Church, the reform of religious life by returning orders to their spiritual foundations, and new spiritual movements focusing on the devotional life and a personal relationship with Christ, including the Spanish mystics and the French school of spirituality. It also involved political activities and used the regional Inquisitions.

A primary emphasis of the Counter-Reformation was a mission to reach parts of the world that had been colonized as predominantly Catholic and also try to reconvert nations such as Sweden and England that once were Catholic from the time of the Christianisation of Europe, but had been lost to the Reformation. Various Counter-Reformation theologians focused only on defending doctrinal positions such as the sacraments and pious practices that were attacked by the Protestant reformers, up to the Second Vatican Council in 1962–1965.

==Terminology==
&#x27;Counter-Reformation’ is a translation of .

Protestant historians have tended to speak in terms of Catholic reform as part of the Counter-Reformation, itself a response to the Reformation.

Catholic historians tend to emphasize them as different. The French historian Henri Daniel-Rops wrote:
The Italian historian Massimo Firpo has distinguished &quot;Catholic Reformation&quot; from &quot;Counter-Reformation&quot; by their issues. In his view, the general &quot;Catholic Reformation&quot; was &quot;centered on the care of souls ..., episcopal residence, the renewal of the clergy, together with the charitable and educational roles of the new religious orders&quot;, whereas the specific &quot;Counter-Reformation&quot; was &quot;founded upon the defence of orthodoxy, the repression of dissent, the reassertion of ecclesiastical authority&quot;.

Other relevant terms that may be encountered:

* &#x27;Pre-Tridentine&#x27; - before, or the status quo ante of, the Council of Trent (such as &quot;pre-Tridentine Mass&quot;)
* &#x27;Tridentine&#x27; - initiated at, or as a result of, the Council of Trent (1545–1563) (such as &quot;Tridentine Mass&quot;)
* &#x27;Post-Tridentine&#x27; - sometimes synonym for Tridentine; alteratively some subsequent distinct reaction or development (such as &quot;post-Tridentine Mass&quot;)

* &quot;Darker colour approximates most intense period of unrest, change or impact&quot;
* Green=Catholic; Red=Protestant; Blue=Other

==Precursor Catholic Reformation==
The 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries saw a spiritual revival in Europe, incubated by the rise of preaching friars, the standardization of the Paris Bible, lay spiritual movements (such as the &quot;devotio moderna&quot;), the examples of nascent saints such as Catherine of Bologna, Antoninus of Florence, Rita of Cascia and Catherine of Genoa, printing, Christian humanism, an urbanized laity who could not flee the towns for monasteries, and other reasons.

A series of ecumenical councils were held with reformist agendas:

* Council of Constance (1415)
* Council of Basel (1431)-Ferrara(1438)-Florence(1449)
* Fifth Council of the Lateran (1512–1517)

The kinds of positive reforms considered were not necessarily the ones that pre-occupied the Hussites (e.g., communion under both kinds, married priests) and later Protestants (e.g., indulgences, justification). Ending schism and war (especially papal war) was regarded by some prelates as the pre-condition for reformation.

At times, the reform talk in the councils tended to lack enough specificity to result in an effective program—except for a tendency to follow the &quot;Observantist&quot; faction of the monastic orders (that less slackness regarding external observances would aid fervour in internal piety) or to promote a top-down (&quot;head and body&quot;) institution-centric focus that reform needed to start at and from the Pope, or bishops, or councils, or princes, or canon law. There was considerable support for the evangelical counsels&#x27; ideal of poverty as a way to short-circuit careerism, though John Wycliffe&#x27;s doctrine of mandatory apostolic poverty was decisively rejected at the Council of Constance.

Issues such as papal nepotism and the wealth, dioscese-absenteeism, and pre-occupation with secular power of important bishops were recognized as perennial and scandalous problems. These resisted serious reform (by successive popes and councils with those bishops, unable to compromise their own interests) for centuries, causing friction as radical reformers periodically arose in response, such as Savonarola.

In the half-century before the reformation, the phenomenon of Bishops closing down decadent monasteries or convents had become more common, as had programs to educate parish priests. In the half-century before the Council of Trent, various evangelical Catholic leaders had experimented with reforms that came to be associated with Protestants: for example, Guillaume Briçonnet (bishop of Meaux) in Paris, with his former teacher Jacques Lefèvre d’Etaples, had statues other than Christ removed from his churches (though not destroyed), replaced the Hail Mary with the Pater Noster prayer, and made available vernacular French versions of the Gospels and Epistles.

Conservative and reforming parties still survived within the Catholic Church even as the Protestant Reformations spread. Protestants decisively broke from the Catholic Church in the 1520s. The two distinct dogmatic positions within the Catholic Church solidified in the 1560s.

=== Priests and Religious Orders ===

The regular orders made their first attempts at reform in the 14th century. The &#x27;Benedictine Bull&#x27; of 1336 reformed the Benedictines and Cistercians. In 1523, the Camaldolese Hermits of Monte Corona were recognized as a separate congregation of monks.

In 1435, Francis of Paola founded the Poor Hermits of Saint Francis of Assisi, who became the Minim Friars. In 1526, Matteo de Bascio suggested reforming the Franciscan rule of life to its original purity, giving birth to the Capuchins, recognized by the pope in 1619. This order was well known to the laity and played an important role in public preaching.

To respond to the new needs of evangelism, clergy formed into religious congregations, taking special vows but with no obligation to assist in a monastery&#x27;s religious offices. These regular clergy taught, preached and took confession but were under a bishop&#x27;s direct authority and not linked to a specific parish or area like a vicar or canon. In Italy, the first congregation of regular clergy was the Theatines founded in 1524 by Gaetano and Cardinal Gian Caraffa. This was followed by the Somaschi Fathers in 1528, the Barnabites in 1530, the Ursulines in 1535, the Jesuits, canonically recognised in 1540, the Clerics Regular of the Mother of God of Lucca in 1583, the Camillians in 1584, the Adorno Fathers in 1588, and finally the Piarists in 1621.

At the end of the 1400s, a reform movement inspired by St Catherine of Genoa&#x27;s hospital ministry started spreading: in Rome, starting 1514, the Oratory of Divine Love attracted an aristocratic membership of priests and laymen to perform anonymous acts of charity and to discuss reform; the members subsequently became the key players in the church handling the Reformation. 
In 1548, then-layman Philip Neri founded a &quot;Confraternity of the Most Holy Trinity of Pilgrims and Convalescents&quot;: this developed into the relatively-free religious community the Oratorians, who were given their constitutions in 1564 and recognized as a religious order by the pope in 1575. They used music and singing to attract the faithful.

==Councils and documents==
===&quot;Confutatio Augustana&quot;===
The 1530 &quot;Confutatio Augustana&quot; was the Catholic response to the Lutheran &quot;Augsburg Confession&quot;.

===Council of Trent===

Pope Paul III (1534–1549) is considered the first pope of the Counter-Reformation, and he also initiated the Council of Trent (1545–1563), tasked with institutional reform, addressing contentious issues such as corrupt bishops and priests, the sale of indulgences, and other financial abuses.

The council upheld the basic structure of the medieval church, its sacramental system, religious orders, and doctrine. It recommended that the form of Mass should be standardised, and this took place in 1570, when Pope Pius V made the Tridentine Mass obligatory.
It rejected all compromise with Protestants, restating basic tenets of the Catholic Faith. The council upheld salvation appropriated by grace through faith &quot;and&quot; works of that faith (not just by faith, as the Protestants insisted) because &quot;faith without works is dead&quot;, as the Epistle of James states (2:22–26).

Transubstantiation, according to which the consecrated bread and wine are held to have been transformed really and substantially into &quot;the body, blood, soul and divinity&quot; of Christ, was also reaffirmed, as were the traditional seven sacraments of the Catholic Church. Other practices that drew the ire of Protestant reformers, such as pilgrimages, the veneration of saints and relics, the use of venerable images and statuary, and the veneration of the Virgin Mary were strongly reaffirmed as spiritually commendable practices.

The council, in the Canon of Trent, officially accepted the Vulgate listing of the Old Testament Bible, which included the deuterocanonical works (called apocrypha by Protestants) on a par with the 39 books found in the Masoretic Text. This reaffirmed the previous Council of Rome and Synods of Carthage (both held in the 4th century AD), which had affirmed the Deuterocanon as scripture. The council also commissioned the Roman Catechism, which served as authoritative Church teaching until the &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; (1992).

While the traditional fundamentals of the Church were reaffirmed, there were noticeable changes to answer complaints that the Counter-Reformers were, tacitly, willing to admit were legitimate. Among the conditions to be corrected by Catholic reformers was the growing divide between the clerics and the laity; many members of the clergy in the rural parishes had been poorly educated. Often, these rural priests did not know Latin and lacked opportunities for proper theological training. Addressing the education of priests had been a fundamental focus of the humanist reformers in the past.

Parish priests were to be better educated in matters of theology and apologetics, while Papal authorities sought to educate the faithful about the meaning, nature and value of art and liturgy, particularly in monastic churches (Protestants had criticised them as &quot;distracting&quot;). Handbooks became more common, describing how to be good priests and confessors.

Thus, the Council of Trent attempted to improve the discipline and administration of the Church. The worldly excesses of the secular Renaissance Church, epitomized by the era of Alexander VI (1492–1503), intensified during the Reformation under Pope Leo X (1513–1521), whose campaign to raise funds for the construction of Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica by supporting use of indulgences served as a key impetus for Martin Luther&#x27;s 95 Theses. The Catholic Church responded to these problems by a vigorous campaign of reform, inspired by earlier Catholic reform movements: humanism, devotionalism, and observantism.

The council, by virtue of its actions, repudiated the pluralism of the secular Renaissance that had previously plagued the Church: the organization of religious institutions was tightened, discipline was improved, and the parish was emphasized. The appointment of bishops for political reasons was no longer tolerated. In the past, the large landholdings forced many bishops to be &quot;absent bishops&quot; who at times were property managers trained in administration. Thus, the Council of Trent combated &quot;absenteeism&quot;, which was the practice of bishops living in Rome or on landed estates rather than in their dioceses. The Council of Trent gave bishops greater power to supervise all aspects of religious life. Zealous prelates, such as Milan&#x27;s Archbishop Carlo Borromeo (1538–1584), later canonized as a saint, set an example by visiting the remotest parishes and instilling high standards.
===&quot;Index Librorum Prohibitorum&quot;===

The 1559–1967 &quot;Index Librorum Prohibitorum&quot; was a directory of prohibited books which was updated twenty times during the next four centuries as books were added or removed from the list by the Sacred Congregation of the Index. It was divided into three classes. The first class listed heretical writers, the second class listed heretical works, and the third class listed forbidden writings which were published without the name of the author. The &quot;Index&quot; was finally suspended on 29 March 1967.

===&quot;Roman Catechism&quot;===

The 1566 &quot;Roman Catechism&quot; provided material in Latin to help the clergy catechize in the vernacular.

===&quot;Nova ordinantia ecclesiastica&quot;===
The 1575 &quot;Nova ordinantia ecclesiastica&quot; was an addendum to the &quot;Liturgia Svecanæ Ecclesiæ catholicæ &amp; orthodoxæ conformia&quot;, also called the &quot;Red Book&quot;. This launched the Liturgical Struggle, which pitted John III of Sweden against his younger brother Charles. During this time, Jesuit Laurentius Nicolai came to lead the Collegium regium Stockholmense. This theatre of the Counter-Reformation was called the &quot;Missio Suetica&quot;.

===&quot;Defensio Tridentinæ fidei&quot;===

The 1578 &quot;Defensio Tridentinæ fidei&quot; was the Catholic response to the &quot;Examination of the Council of Trent&quot;.

===&quot;Unigenitus&quot;===

The 1713 papal bull &quot;Unigenitus&quot; condemned 101 propositions of the French Jansenist theologian Pasquier Quesnel (1634–1719). Jansenism was a Protestant-leaning or mediating movement within Catholicism, in France and the Spanish Netherlands, that was criticized for being crypto-Calvinist, denying that Christ died for all, promoting that Holy Communion should be received very infrequently, and more. After Jansenist propositions were condemned it led to the development of the Old Catholic Church of the Netherlands.

==Politics and wars==

===British Isles===
===The Netherlands===
When the Calvinists took control of various parts of the Netherlands in the Dutch Revolt, the Catholics led by Philip II of Spain fought back. The king sent in Alexander Farnese as Governor-General of the Spanish Netherlands from 1578 to 1592.

Farnese led a successful campaign 1578–1592 against the Dutch Revolt, in which he captured the main cities in the south (the future Belgium) and returned them to the control of Catholic Spain. He took advantage of the divisions in the ranks of his opponents between the Dutch-speaking Flemish and the French-speaking Walloons, using persuasion to take advantage of the divisions and foment the growing discord. By doing so he was able to bring back the Walloon provinces to an allegiance to the king. By the treaty of Arras in 1579, he secured the support of the &#x27;Malcontents&#x27;, as the Catholic nobles of the south were styled.

The seven northern provinces as well as the County of Flanders and Duchy of Brabant, controlled by Calvinists, responded with the Union of Utrecht, where they resolved to stick together to fight Spain. Farnese secured his base in Hainaut and Artois, then moved against Brabant and Flanders. City after city fell: Tournai, Maastricht, Breda, Bruges and Ghent opened their gates.

Farnese finally laid siege to the great seaport of Antwerp. The town was open to the sea, strongly fortified, and well defended under the leadership of Marnix van St. Aldegonde. Farnese cut off all access to the sea by constructing a bridge of boats across the Scheldt. Antwerp surrendered in 1585 as 60,000 citizens (60 per cent of the pre-siege population) fled north. All of the Southern Netherlands was once more under Spanish control.

In a war composed mostly of sieges rather than battles, he proved his mettle. His strategy was to offer generous terms for surrender: there would be no massacres or looting; historic urban privileges were retained; there was a full pardon and amnesty; return to the Catholic Church would be gradual.

Meanwhile, Catholic refugees from the north regrouped in Cologne and Douai and developed a more militant, Tridentine identity. They became the mobilizing forces of a popular Counter-Reformation in the south, thereby facilitating the eventual emergence of the state of Belgium.

===Germany===

The Augsburg Interim was a period where Counter-Reformation measures were exacted upon defeated Protestant populations following the Schmalkaldic War.

During the centuries of Counter-Reformation, new towns, collectively termed (plural), were founded especially as homes for refugees fleeing the Counter-Reformation. Supporters of the Unity of the Brethren settled in parts of Silesia and Poland. Protestants from the County of Flanders often fled to the Lower Rhine region and northern Germany. French Huguenots crossed the Rhineland to Central Germany. Most towns were named either after the ruler who established them or as expressions of gratitude, e.g. &quot;Freudenstadt&quot; (&quot;Joy Town&quot;), &quot;Glückstadt&quot; (&quot;Happy Town&quot;).

A list of &quot;Exulantenstädte&quot;:

* Altona, Hamburg
* Bad Karlshafen
* Freudenstadt
* Friedrichsdorf
* Glückstadt
* Hanau
* Johanngeorgenstadt
* Krefeld
* Neu-Isenburg
* Neusalza-Spremberg
====Cologne====
The Cologne War (1583–1589) was a conflict between Protestant and Catholic factions that devastated the Electorate of Cologne. After Archbishop Gebhard Truchsess von Waldburg, the prince-elector ruling the area, converted to Protestantism, Catholics elected another archbishop, Ernst of Bavaria, and successfully defeated Gebhard and his allies.

===Belgium===
===Bohemia and Austria===

In the Habsburg hereditary lands, which had become predominantly Protestant except for Tyrol, the Counter-Reformation began with Emperor Rudolf II, who began suppressing Protestant activity in 1576. This conflict escalated into the Bohemian Revolt of 1620. Defeated, the Protestant nobility and clergy of Bohemia and Austria were expelled from the country or forced to convert to Catholicism. Among these exiles were important German poets such as Sigmund von Birken, Catharina Regina von Greiffenberg, and Johann Wilhelm von Stubenberg. This influenced the development of German Baroque literature, especially around Regensburg and Nuremberg. Some lived as crypto-Protestants.

Others moved to Saxony or the Margraviate of Brandenburg. The Salzburg Protestants were exiled in the 18th century, especially to Prussia. The Transylvanian Landlers were deported to the eastern part of the Habsburg domain. As heir to the throne, Joseph II spoke vehemently to his mother, Maria Theresa, in 1777 against the expulsion of Protestants from Moravia, calling her choices &quot;unjust, impious, impossible, harmful and ridiculous.&quot; His 1781 Patent of Toleration can be regarded as the end of the political Counter-Reformation, although there were still smaller expulsions against Protestants (such as the Zillertal expulsion). In 1966, Archbishop Andreas Rohracher expressed regret about the expulsions.

===France===

In France, from 1562 Catholics and Huguenots (Reformed Protestants) fought a series of wars, resulting in millions of deaths until the Edict of Nantes brought religious peace in 1598. It affirmed Catholicism as the state religion but granted considerable toleration to Protestants, as well as political and military privileges. The latter would be lost at the Peace of Alès of 1629, but the religious toleration lasted until the reign of Louis XIV, who resumed persecution of Protestants and finally abolished their right to worship with the Edict of Fontainebleau in 1685.

In 1565, several hundred Huguenot shipwreck survivors surrendered to the Spanish authorities in Florida, presuming they would be treated fairly. The small number of Catholics among the shipwrecked were spared but the rest were all executed for heresy, with active clerical participation.

===Italy===
===Poland and Lithuania===
===Spain===
====Indian====
===Eastern Rites===

====Middle East====
====Ukraine====

The effects of the Council of Trent and the Counter-Reformation also paved the way for Ruthenian Orthodox Christians to return to full communion with the Catholic Church while preserving their Byzantine tradition. Pope Clement VIII received the Ruthenian bishops into full communion on February 7, 1596. Under the treaty of the Union of Brest, Rome recognized the Ruthenians&#x27; continued practice of Byzantine liturgical tradition, married clergy, and consecration of bishops from within the Ruthenian Christian tradition. Moreover, the treaty specifically exempts Ruthenians from using a Creed with the Filioque clause as a condition for reconciliation, and the Ruthenians agree not to debate Purgatory.

== Outcomes ==
Scholars have made a distinction between the political issue of a state&#x27;s established religion remaining Catholic and the advance of religious reforms within Catholicism: Anglican historian G.E. Duffield notes &quot;RC reform[...]does not easily fit into geographical patterns as Protestant reform does.&quot;

===Areas affected===
The Counter-Reformation succeeded in drastically diminishing Protestantism in Lithuania, Poland, France, Italy, and the vast lands controlled by the Habsburgs including Austria, southern Germany, Bohemia (now in the Czech Republic), the Spanish Netherlands (now Belgium and surrounds), Croatia, and Slovenia. It did not succeed as completely in Hungary, where a sizeable Protestant minority remains to this day, although Catholics still are the largest Christian denomination.

===Religious orders===

New religious orders were a fundamental part of the reforms. Orders such as the Capuchins, Discalced Carmelites, Discalced Augustinians and Augustinian Recollects, Cistercian Feuillants, Angelines and Ursulines, Theatines, Barnabites, and the Congregation of the Oratory of Saint Philip Neri attempted either to be less decadent or to engage in charitable service, and set examples of Catholic renewal particularly in Southern Europe. The Jesuits especially worked in rural parishes. Most of these had been founded earlier in the 15th Century, as part of Catholic reforms before the Council of Trent.

The Theatines undertook checking the spread of heresy and contributed to a regeneration of the clergy. The Capuchins, an offshoot of the Franciscan order notable for their preaching and for their care for the poor and the sick, grew rapidly. Capuchin-founded confraternities took special interest in the poor and lived austerely. Members of orders active in overseas missionary expansion expressed the view that the rural parishes often needed Christianizing as much as the heathens of Asia and the Americas.

The Ursulines focused on the special task of educating girls, the first order of women to be dedicated to that goal. Devotion to the traditional works of mercy exemplified the Catholic Reformation&#x27;s reaffirmation of the importance of both faith and works and salvation through God&#x27;s grace and repudiation of the maxim &quot;sola fide&quot; emphasized by Protestants sects. Not only did they make the Church more effective, but they also reaffirmed fundamental premises of the medieval Church.

The Jesuits were the most effective of the new Catholic orders. An heir to the devotional, observantine, and legalist traditions, the Jesuits organized along military lines. The worldliness of the Renaissance Church had no part in their new order. Loyola&#x27;s masterwork &quot;Spiritual Exercises&quot; showed the emphasis of handbooks characteristic of Catholic reformers before the Reformations, reminiscent of devotionalism.

Jesuits participated in the expansion of the Church in the Americas and Asia, by their missionary activity. Loyola&#x27;s biography contributed to an emphasis on popular piety that had waned under political popes such as Alexander VI and Leo X. After recovering from a serious wound, he took a vow to &quot;serve only God and the Roman pontiff, His vicar on Earth.&quot; The emphasis on the Pope is a reaffirmation of the medieval papalism, while the Council of Trent defeated conciliarism, the belief that general councils of the Church collectively were God&#x27;s representative on Earth rather than the Pope. Taking the Pope as an absolute leader, the Jesuits contributed to the Counter-Reformation Church along a line harmonized with Rome.

===Devotion and mysticism===

The Catholic Reformation was not only a political and Church policy oriented movement, but it also included major figures such as Catherine of Genoa, Ignatius of Loyola, Teresa of Ávila, John of the Cross, Francis de Sales, and Philip Neri, who added to the spirituality of the Catholic Church. Teresa of Avila and John of the Cross were Spanish mystics and reformers of the Carmelite Order, whose ministry focused on interior conversion to Christ, the deepening of prayer, and commitment to God&#x27;s will. Teresa was given the task of developing and writing about the way to perfection in her love and unity with Christ. Thomas Merton called John of the Cross the greatest of all mystical theologians.

The spirituality of Filippo Neri, who lived in Rome at the same time as Ignatius, was practically oriented, too, but totally opposed to the Jesuit approach. Said Filippo, &quot;If I have a real problem, I contemplate what Ignatius would do ... and then I do the exact opposite&quot;. As a recognition of their joint contribution to the spiritual renewal within the Catholic reformation, Ignatius of Loyola, Filippo Neri, and Teresa of Ávila were canonized on the same day, March 12, 1622.

The Virgin Mary played an increasingly central role in Catholic devotions. The victory at the Battle of Lepanto in 1571 was accredited to the Virgin Mary and signified the beginning of a strong resurgence of Marian devotions. During and after the Catholic Reformation, Marian piety experienced unforeseen growth with over 500 pages of mariological writings during the 17th century alone. The Jesuit Francisco Suárez was the first theologian to use the Thomist method on Marian theology. Other well-known contributors to Marian spirituality are Saints Lawrence of Brindisi, Robert Bellarmine, and Francis de Sales.

The sacrament of penance was transformed from a social to a personal experience; that is, from a public community act to a private confession. It now took place in private in a confessional. It was a change in its emphasis from reconciliation with the Church to reconciliation directly with God and from emphasis on social sins of hostility to private sins (called &quot;the secret sins of the heart&quot;).

===Baroque art===

The Catholic Church was a leading arts patron across much of Europe. The goal of much art in the Counter-Reformation, especially in the Rome of Bernini and the Flanders of Peter Paul Rubens, was to restore Catholicism&#x27;s predominance and centrality. This was one of the drivers of the Baroque style that emerged across Europe in the late sixteenth century. In areas where Catholicism predominated, architecture and painting, and to a lesser extent music, reflected Counter-Reformation goals.

The Council of Trent proclaimed that architecture, painting and sculpture had a role in conveying Catholic theology. Any work that might arouse &quot;carnal desire&quot; was inadmissible in churches, while any depiction of Christ&#x27;s suffering and explicit agony was desirable and proper. In an era when some Protestant reformers were destroying images of saints and whitewashing walls, Catholic reformers reaffirmed the importance of art, with special encouragement given to images of the Virgin Mary.

====Decrees on art====

&quot;The Last Judgment&quot;, a fresco in the Sistine Chapel by Michelangelo (1534–1541), came under persistent attack in the Counter-Reformation for, among other things, nudity (later painted over for several centuries), not showing Christ seated or bearded, and including the pagan figure of Charon.
Italian painting after 1520, with the notable exception of the art of Venice, developed into Mannerism, a highly sophisticated style striving for effect, that concerned many Churchmen as lacking appeal for the mass of the population. Church pressure to restrain religious imagery affected art from the 1530s and resulted in the decrees of the final session of the Council of Trent in 1563 including short and rather inexplicit passages concerning religious images, which were to have great impact on the development of Catholic art. Previous Catholic councils had rarely felt the need to pronounce on these matters, unlike Orthodox ones which have often ruled on specific types of images.

The decree confirmed the traditional doctrine that images only represented the person depicted, and that veneration to them was paid to the person, not the image, and further instructed that:
Ten years after the decree Paolo Veronese was summoned by the Holy Office to explain why his &quot;Last Supper&quot;, a huge canvas for the refectory of a monastery, contained, in the words of the Holy Office: &quot;buffoons, drunken Germans, dwarfs and other such scurrilities&quot; as well as extravagant costumes and settings, in what is indeed a fantasy version of a Venetian patrician feast. Veronese was told that he must change his painting within a three-month period. He just changed the title to &quot;The Feast in the House of Levi&quot;, still an episode from the Gospels, but a less doctrinally central one, and no more was said.

The number of such decorative treatments of religious subjects declined sharply, as did &quot;unbecomingly or confusedly arranged&quot; Mannerist pieces, as a number of books, notably by the Flemish theologian Molanus, Charles Borromeo and Cardinal Gabriele Paleotti, and instructions by local bishops, amplified the decrees, often going into minute detail on what was acceptable. Much traditional iconography considered without adequate scriptural foundation was in effect prohibited, as was any inclusion of classical pagan elements in religious art, and almost all nudity, including that of the infant Jesus.

According to the great medievalist Émile Mâle, this was &quot;the death of medieval art&quot;, but it paled in contrast to the Iconclasm present in some Protestant circles and did not apply to secular paintings. Some Counter Reformation painters and sculptors include Titian, Tintoretto, Federico Barocci, Scipione Pulzone, El Greco, Peter Paul Rubens, Guido Reni, Anthony van Dyck, Bernini, Zurbarán, Rembrandt and Bartolomé Esteban Murillo.

===Church music=== 
The Council of Trent is believed to be the apex of the Counter-Reformation&#x27;s influence on Church music in the 16th century. However, the council&#x27;s pronouncements on music were not the first attempt at reform. The Catholic Church had spoken out against a perceived abuse of music used in the Mass before the Council of Trent ever convened to discuss music in 1562. The manipulation of the Creed and using non-liturgical songs was addressed in 1503, and secular singing and the intelligibility of the text in the delivery of psalmody in 1492. The delegates at the council were just a link in the long chain of Church clergy who had pushed for a reform of the musical liturgy reaching back as far as 1322.

Fueling the cry for reform from many ecclesial figures was the compositional technique popular in the 15th and 16th centuries of using musical material and even the accompanying texts from other compositions such as motets, madrigals, and chansons. Several voices singing different texts in different languages made any of the text difficult to distinguish from the mixture of words and notes. The parody mass would then contain melodies (usually the tenor line) and words from songs that could have been, and often were, on sensual subjects. The musical liturgy of the Church was being more and more influenced by secular tunes and styles. The Council of Paris, which met in 1528, as well as the Council of Trent were making attempts to restore the sense of sacredness to the Church setting and what was appropriate for the Mass. The councils were responding to issues of their day.

One of the most austere moves at reform came late in 1562 when, perhaps instructed by some legates, Egidio Foscarari (bishop of Modena) and Gabriele Paleotti (archbishop of Bologna) began work on reforming religious orders and their practices involving the liturgy in their dioceses. Paleotti&#x27;s reforms for convents of nuns allowed only the use of an organ, prohibited professional musicians, and banished polyphonic singing; this was much more strict than the Trent council&#x27;s eventual edicts or even those devised for the Palestrina legend.

====Reforms during the 22nd session====
The Council of Trent met sporadically from December 13, 1545, to December 4, 1563, to reform many parts of the Catholic Church. 

The 22nd session required that secular elements be kept out of Mass music, keeping polyphony implicitly allowed. 

====Proposed removal of polyphony====
The issue of textual intelligibility did not make its way into the final edicts of the 22nd session but were only featured in preliminary debates. However Archbishop Paleotti, in his Acts (the minutes of the Council), attempted to bring to equal importance the issues of intelligibility. 

The idea that the council called to remove all polyphony from the Church is widespread, but there is no documentary evidence to support that claim. It is possible, however, that some of the Fathers had proposed such a measure. The Council of Trent did not focus on the style of music but on attitudes of worship and reverence during the Mass.

More severe measures had been submitted for consideration, as proposed Canon 8 of &quot;Abuses in the Sacrifice of the Mass&quot; during a meeting of the council on September 10, 1562. The proposed Canon 8 states that &quot;Since the sacred mysteries should be celebrated with utmost reverence, with both deepest feeling toward God alone, and with external worship that is truly suitable and becoming, so that others may be filled with devotion and called to religion: ... Everything should be regulated so that the Masses, whether they be celebrated with the plain voice or in song, with everything clearly and quickly executed, may reach the ears of the hearers and quietly penetrate their hearts. In those Masses where measured music and organ are customary, nothing profane should be intermingled, but only hymns and divine praises. If something from the divine service is sung with the organ while the service proceeds, let if first be recited in a simple, clear voice, lest the reading of the sacred words be imperceptible. But the entire manner of singing in musical modes should be calculated not to afford vain delight to the ear, but so that the words may be comprehensible to all; and thus may the hearts of the listeners be caught up into the desire for celestial harmonies and contemplation of the joys of the blessed.&quot;

The emperor Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor has been attributed to be the &quot;saviour of Church music&quot; because he said polyphony ought not to be driven out of the Church. But Ferdinand was most likely an alarmist and read into the council the possibility of a total ban on polyphony.

The Canon 8 text is often quoted as the Council of Trent&#x27;s decree on Church music, but that is a glaring misunderstanding of the canon; it was only a proposed decree. In fact, the delegates at the council never officially accepted canon 8 in its popular form but bishops of Granada, Coimbra, and Segovia pushed for the long statement about music to be attenuated and many other prelates of the council joined enthusiastically.

=====Saviour-Legend=====
The crises regarding polyphony and intelligibility of the text and the threat that polyphony was to be removed completely, which was assumed to be coming from the council, has a very dramatic legend of resolution. The legend goes that Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina (c. 1525/26–1594), a Church musician and choirmaster in Rome, wrote a Mass for the council delegates in order to demonstrate that a polyphonic composition could set the text in such a way that the words could be clearly understood and that was still pleasing to the ear. Palestrina&#x27;s Missa Papae Marcelli (Mass for Pope Marcellus) was performed before the council and received such a welcoming reception among the delegates that they completely changed their minds and allowed polyphony to stay in use in the musical liturgy. Therefore, Palestrina came to be named the &quot;saviour of Church polyphony&quot;. This legend, though unfounded, has long been a mainstay of histories of music. The saviour-myth was first spread by an account by Aggazzari and Banchieri in 1609 who said that Pope Marcellus was trying to replace all polyphony with plainsong. Palestrina&#x27;s &quot;Missa Papae Marcelli&quot; was indeed performed for the Pope in 1564 , after the 22nd session, while reforms were being considered for the Sistine Choir.

The Pope Marcellus Mass, in short, was not important in its own day and did not help save Church polyphony. What is undeniable is that despite any solid evidence of his influence during or after the Council of Trent, no figure is more qualified to represent the cause of polyphony in the Mass than Palestrina. Pope Pius IV upon hearing Palestrina&#x27;s music would make Palestrina, by Papal Brief, the model for future generations of Catholic composers of sacred music.

====Reforms following the Council of Trent====
Like his contemporary Palestrina, the Flemish composer Jacobus de Kerle (1531/32–1591) was also credited with giving a model of composition for the Council of Trent. His composition in four-parts, Preces, marks the &quot;official turning point of the Counter Reformation&#x27;s a cappella ideal.&quot; Kerle was the only ranking composer of the Netherlands to have acted in conformity with the council. Another musical giant on equal standing with Palestrina, Orlando di Lasso (1530/32–1594) was an important figure in music history though less of a purist than Palestrina. He expressed sympathy for the council&#x27;s concerns but still showed favor for the &quot;Parady chanson Masses.&quot;

Despite the dearth of edicts from the council regarding polyphony and textual clarity, the reforms that followed from the 22nd session filled in the gaps left by the council in stylistic areas. In the 24th session the council gave authority to &quot;Provincial Synods&quot; to discern provisions for Church music. The decision to leave practical application and stylistic matters to local ecclesiastical leaders was important in shaping the future of Catholic church music. It was left then up to the local Church leaders and Church musicians to find proper application for the council&#x27;s decrees.

Though originally theological and directed towards the attitudes of the musicians, the Council&#x27;s decrees came to be thought of by Church musicians as a pronouncement on proper musical styles. This understanding was most likely spread through musicians who sought to implement the council&#x27;s declarations but did not read the official Tridentine pronouncements. Church musicians were probably influenced by order from their ecclesiastical patrons. Composers who reference the council&#x27;s reforms in prefaces to their compositions do not adequately claim a musical basis from the council but a spiritual and religious basis of their art.

The Cardinal Archbishop of Milan, Charles Borromeo, was a very important figure in reforming Church music after the Council of Trent. Though Borromeo was an aide to the pope in Rome and was unable to be in Milan, he eagerly pushed for the decrees of the council to be quickly put into practice in Milan. Borromeo kept in contact with his church in Milian through letters and eagerly encouraged the leaders there to implement the reforms coming from the Council of Trent. In one of his letters to his vicar in the Milan diocese, Nicolo Ormaneto of Verona, Borromeo commissioned the master of the chapel, Vincenzo Ruffo (1508–1587), to write a Mass that would make the words as easy to understand as possible. Borromeo also suggested that if Don Nicola, a composer of a more chromatic style, was in Milan he too could compose a Mass and the two be compared for textural clarity. Borromeo was likely involved or heard of the questions regarding textual clarity because of his request to Ruffo.

Ruffo took Borromeo&#x27;s commission seriously and set out to compose in a style that presented the text so that all words would be intelligible and the textual meaning be the most important part of the composition. His approach was to move all the voices in a homorhythmic manner with no complicated rhythms, and to use dissonance very conservatively. Ruffo&#x27;s approach was certainly a success for textual clarity and simplicity, but if his music was very theoretically pure it was not an artistic success despite Ruffo&#x27;s attempts to bring interest to the monotonous four-part texture. Ruffo&#x27;s compositional style which favored the text was well in line with the council&#x27;s perceived concern with intelligibility. Thus the belief in the council&#x27;s strong edicts regarding textual intelligibility became to characterize the development of sacred Church music.

The Council of Trent brought about other changes in music: most notably developing the Missa brevis, Lauda and &quot;Spiritual Madrigal&quot; (Madrigali Spirituali). Additionally, the numerous sequences were mostly prohibited in the 1570 Missal of Pius V. The remaining sequences were &quot;Victimae paschali laudes&quot; for Easter, &quot;Veni Sancte Spiritus&quot; for Pentecost, &quot;Lauda Sion Salvatorem&quot; for Corpus Christi, and &quot;Dies Irae&quot; for All Souls and for Masses for the Dead.

Another reform following the Council of Trent was the publication of the 1568 &quot;Roman Breviary&quot;.

===Calendrical studies===

More celebrations of holidays and similar events raised a need to have these events followed closely throughout the dioceses. But there was a problem with the accuracy of the calendar: by the sixteenth century the Julian calendar was almost ten days out of step with the seasons and the heavenly bodies. Among the astronomers who were asked to work on the problem of how the calendar could be reformed was Nicolaus Copernicus, a canon at Frombork (Frauenburg). In the dedication to &quot;De revolutionibus orbium coelestium&quot; (1543), Copernicus mentioned the reform of the calendar proposed by the Fifth Council of the Lateran (1512–1517). As he explains, a proper measurement of the length of the year was a necessary foundation to calendar reform. By implication, his work replacing the Ptolemaic system with a heliocentric model was prompted in part by the need for calendar reform.

An actual new calendar had to wait until the Gregorian calendar in 1582. At the time of its publication, &quot;De revolutionibus&quot; passed with relatively little comment: little more than a mathematical convenience that simplified astronomical references for a more accurate calendar. Physical evidence suggesting Copernicus&#x27;s theory regarding the earth&#x27;s motion was literally true promoted the apparent heresy against the religious thought of the time. As a result, during the Galileo affair, Galileo Galilei was placed under house arrest, served in Rome, Siena, Arcetri, and Florence, for publishing writings said to be &quot;vehemently suspected of being heretical.&quot; His opponents condemned heliocentric theory and temporarily banned its teaching in 1633. Similarly, the Academia Secretorum Naturae in Naples had been shut down in 1578. As a result of clerical opposition, heliocentricists emigrated from Catholic to Protestant areas, some forming the Melanchthon Circle.

<text>David Guest (6 January 1911– 28 July 1938) was a British mathematician and philosopher who volunteered to fight for the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War and was killed in Spain in 1938. He was the uncle of American-British musician, actor and director Christopher Guest.

==Biography==
Guest was the son of Leslie Haden-Guest (created 1st Baron Haden-Guest in 1950), a longtime Labour Party Member of Parliament and Muriel Ethel Carmel Goldsmid, daughter of Albert Goldsmid (a pioneering Zionist as head of Hovevei Zion in Great Britain and Ireland) from the Goldsmid family of merchant bankers. 

He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1929 and studied from 1930 to 1931 in Göttingen in Germany, where he witnessed the latter years of the Weimar Republic and the rise of the Nazi Party. He became involved &quot;anti-fascist activity&quot;. Arrested at a communist youth demonstration, he was released after a two weeks. On his return he joined the Communist Party at Cambridge in 1931. There Guest became the head of a party cell that included John Cornford, Guy Burgess, Donald Maclean, Victor Kiernan and James Klugmann. This enabled dons such as Maurice Dobb and John Bernal to take a more discreet back seat. It was claimed that David Guest would &quot;stride into hall at Trinity wearing a hammer and sickle pin in his lapel.&quot; At Cambridge he attended discussions of the Moral Sciences Club.

In 1933, after leaving Cambridge Guest moved to Battersea, South London, where he lectured in mathematics and worked for the Communist party at the &quot;Peoples&#x27; Bookshop&quot; in Lavender Hill. He soon became active in Battersea Young Communist League. While working at the bookshop he joined the shop workers union. In May 1935, he organised a Youth Peace Parade of fifty young people, some dressed as nurses, others with gas masks and with stretchers, to warn of war. For a short period of time he taught at a secondary school for English-speaking children in Moscow, but returned to England to lecture at University College in Southampton.

In 1938 he left his post as a lecturer at University College to volunteer for the International Brigades fighting in Spain. He wrote of his decision:
:&quot;Today we have certainly entered a period of crisis, when the arguments of &#x27;normal times&#x27; no longer apply, when considerations of most immediate usefulness come in. That is why I have decided to take the opportunity of going to Spain.&quot;
Guest arrived in Spain on 31 March 1938 and joined the British Battalion of the International Brigades. The Battalion went into action at the Battle of the Ebro which began on 25 July 1938. Three days later, on 28 July, Guest was killed on Hill 481 at Gandesa by a sniper as he read a newspaper.

After his death, notes he had made while lecturing at the Marx Memorial Workers&#x27; School were published as &quot;A Text Book of Dialectical Materialism&quot; in 1939.

<doc id="236262" wikidata="Q5280559" url="?curid=236262" title="Director of Public Prosecutions">
<text>The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) is the office or official charged with the prosecution of criminal offences in several criminal jurisdictions around the world. The title is used mainly in jurisdictions that are or have been members of the Commonwealth of Nations.

==Australia==

Australia has a Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, which was set up by the &quot;Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983&quot; and started operations in 1984. The eight states and territories of Australia also have their own DPPs.

The Office of DPP operates independently of Government. Ultimate authority for authorising prosecutions lies with the Attorney General. However, since that is a political post, and it is desired to have a non-political (public service) post carry out this function in most circumstances, the prosecutorial powers of the AG are normally delegated to the DPP.

It is common for those who hold the office of Commonwealth or State DPP later to be appointed to a high judicial office. Examples include Mark Weinberg, now a justice of the Court of Appeal in the Supreme Court of Victoria; Michael Rozenes, Chief Judge of the County Court of Victoria from 2002 to 2015; Brian Martin, now Chief Justice of the Northern Territory; John McKechnie, now a justice of the Supreme Court of Western Australia; and Paul Coghlan, now a justice of the Supreme Court of Victoria.

==Belize==

The Director of Public Prosecutions of Belize is the official responsible for the prosecution of criminal offences. The director heads the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.

==Canada==
In Canada, each province&#x27;s Crown Attorney Office is responsible for the conduct of criminal prosecutions. In Ontario, the local Crown Attorney&#x27;s Office in the Criminal Law Division is in charge of criminal cases. Only British Columbia, Nova Scotia, and Quebec (a civil code jurisdiction) have a Director of Public Prosecutions office &quot;per se&quot;.

The Public Prosecution Service of Canada (PPSC) is a federal government organisation, created on 12 December 2006, when the Director of Public Prosecutions Act, enacted as part of the &quot;Federal Accountability Act&quot;, came into force. The Act split the conduct of federal prosecutions from the Department of Justice and created the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (officially called the Public Prosecution Service of Canada).

The PPSC fulfills the responsibilities of the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada in the discharge of the Attorney General&#x27;s criminal law mandate by prosecuting criminal offences under federal jurisdiction. In this regard, the PPSC assumes the role played within the Department of Justice by the former Federal Prosecution Service (FPS). The PPSC takes on additional responsibilities for prosecuting new fraud offences under the &quot;Financial Administration Act&quot;, as well as offences under the &quot;Canada Elections Act&quot;. Unlike the FPS, which was part of the Department of Justice, the PPSC is an independent organisation, reporting to Parliament through the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada.

The PPSC is responsible for prosecuting offences under more than 50 federal statutes and for providing prosecution-related legal advice to law enforcement agencies. Cases prosecuted by the PPSC include those involving drugs, organised crime, terrorism, tax law, money laundering and proceeds of crime, crimes against humanity and war crimes, Criminal Code offences in the territories, and a large number of federal regulatory offences.

The creation of the PPSC reflects the decision to make transparent the principle of prosecutorial independence, free from any improper influence. The mandate of the PPSC is set out in the &quot;Director of Public Prosecutions Act&quot;. The act calls on the PPSC to provide prosecutorial advice to law enforcement agencies, and to act as prosecutor in matters prosecuted by the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada on behalf of the Crown. In addition, the mandate includes initiating and conducting prosecutions on behalf of the Crown with respect to offences under the &quot;Canada Elections Act&quot;.

The PPSC reports to Parliament through the Attorney General of Canada. The &quot;Director of Public Prosecutions Act&quot; states that the Director of Public Prosecutions acts &quot;under and on behalf of the Attorney General of Canada.&quot; The relationship between the attorney general and the director is premised on the principles of respect for the independence of the prosecution function and the need to consult on important matters of general interest.

Safeguarding the director&#x27;s independence is the requirement that all instructions from the attorney general be in writing and published in the &quot;Canada Gazette&quot;. In turn, the director must inform the attorney general of any prosecution or planned intervention that may raise important questions of general interest, allowing the attorney general the opportunity to intervene in, or assume conduct of, a case. Additionally, the PPSC must provide the attorney general with an annual report for tabling in Parliament.

The first director of the PPSC was Brian J. Saunders. The current director of the PPSC is Kathleen Roussel.

==Hong Kong==

The Director of Public Prosecutions () of Hong Kong heads the Prosecutions Division of the Department of Justice, which is responsible for prosecuting trials and appeals on behalf of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, providing legal advice to law enforcement agencies on investigations, acting on behalf of the Secretary for Justice in the institution of criminal proceedings, and providing advice to bureaux and departments on measures to reform the criminal law. 

The DPP is superintended by the Secretary for Justice, a political appointee, who is also accountable for the decisions of the DPP. The position title was until the handover of Hong Kong to China on 1 July 1997 Crown Prosecutor. The Secretary for Justice and the Department of Justice were, until 1997, named the Attorney General and the Legal Department, respectively.

== India ==
* State of Kerala 
** Directorate of Prosecution, Kerala Director General of Prosecution of Kerala heads the Prosecution Directorate of Department of Home, which is responsible for prosecuting trials and appeals on behalf of the state, providing legal advice to law enforcement agencies on investigations, supervision and control of prosecution machinery in the state, and providing advice to bureaux and departments on measures to reform the criminal law. The DGP is assisted by a Director of Prosecution at headquarters, Deputy Directors of Prosecution in districts and Assistant Public Prosecutors in various courts of the state.

==Ireland==

The Director of Public Prosecutions has been responsible for prosecution of all indictable criminal offences in Ireland since the enactment of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1974. Before 1974 all crimes and offences were prosecuted at the suit of (after action taken by) the attorney general. The DPP may also issue a certificate that a case should be referred to the Special Criminal Court, a juryless trial court usually reserved for terrorists and organised criminals.

The current director is Catherine Pierse. James Hamilton, who had served as DPP for 12 years, announced in July 2011 that he would be taking early retirement and stepped down in November 2011.

List of DPPs since 1974:
*1974–1999 Eamonn Barnes
*1999–2011 James Hamilton
*2011–2021 Claire Loftus
*2021–present Catherine Pierse

The agency&#x27;s headquarters is located on the southern edge of Phoenix Park, Dublin; in a group of historic buildings that used to be the Royal Military Infirmary before independence.

==Malta==
During its review of the Constitution of Malta, the Venice Commission proposed to split the role of the Attorney-General (who, at the time, was both the principal legal adviser to the Government and the principal public prosecutor in the country) on the model of other Commonwealth countries: the Attorney-General would henceforth serve only as the Government&#x27;s legal advisor, while their prosecutorial functions would be spun off into a new office of Director of Public Prosecutions. The actual amendments, however, split the role in the opposite way, the Attorney-General remains the chief public prosecutor, while legal advice to the government is provided by the State Advocate.

==Mauritius==
The current DPP is Rashid Ahmine who was promoted in 2022 to this role after the retirement of Satyajit Boolell S.C, who occupied the post since 2009.

==Norway==
In Norway the Director of Public Prosecutions (&quot;Riksadvokaten&quot;) is the head of the Norwegian Prosecuting Authority. The director has the coordinative leadership as well as the highest authority to prosecute criminal offences. The director is directly involved only in certain cases, such as crimes for which the maximum penalty is 21 years in prison. The director is subordinate to the Government Cabinet, however, the cabinet has never reversed a decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions. Jørn Sigurd Maurud is the current director and has been in that position since November 2019.

==South Africa==
In South Africa public prosecutions are conducted by the National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP), the head of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA). The NDPP is supported by a Chief Executive Officer, Deputies, Provincial Directors of Public Prosecutions, and several Special Directors.

==United Kingdom==
===England and Wales===

In England and Wales, the office of Director of Public Prosecutions was first created in 1880 as part of the Home Office, and had its own department from 1908. The DPP was responsible for the prosecution of only a small number of major cases until 1986 when responsibility for prosecutions was transferred to a new Crown Prosecution Service with the DPP as its head. The Director is appointed by the Attorney General for England and Wales.

The current DPP, since November 2023, is Stephen Parkinson.

===Scotland===
Under Scots law the public prosecutor is the Lord Advocate who is the head of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service. All investigations by the police are nominally under the direction of the Lord Advocate and local procurators fiscal, and all prosecutions are carried out in the name of the Lord Advocate.

The current Lord Advocate is Dorothy Bain KC.

===Northern Ireland===
In Northern Ireland a similar situation existed, and the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland now heads the Public Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland.

The current DPP is Stephen Herron, who was appointed in 2017.
===British Overseas Territories===
In the Turks and Caicos Islands, the position of Director of Public Prosecutions was newly created by the 2011 Constitution. Prior to this, the Attorney-General had control over criminal prosecutions. The current Director of Public Prosecutions is Jillian Williams.

<doc id="236263" wikidata="Q2075298" url="?curid=236263" title="To Autumn">
<text>&quot;To Autumn&quot; is a poem by English Romantic poet John Keats (31 October 1795 – 23 February 1821). The work was composed on 19 September 1819 and published in 1820 in a volume of Keats&#x27;s poetry that included &quot;Lamia&quot; and &quot;The Eve of St. Agnes&quot;. &quot;To Autumn&quot; is the final work in a group of poems known as Keats&#x27;s &quot;1819 odes&quot;. Although personal problems left him little time to devote to poetry in 1819, he composed &quot;To Autumn&quot; after a walk near Winchester one autumnal evening. The work marks the end of his poetic career, as he needed to earn money and could no longer devote himself to the lifestyle of a poet. A little over a year after the publication of &quot;To Autumn&quot;, Keats died in Rome.

The poem has three eleven-line stanzas which describe a progression through the season, from the late maturation of the crops to the harvest and to the last days of autumn when winter is nearing. The imagery is richly achieved through the personification of Autumn, and the description of its bounty, its sights and sounds. It has parallels in the work of English landscape artists, with Keats himself describing the fields of stubble that he saw on his walk as conveying the warmth of &quot;some pictures&quot;.

The work has been interpreted as a meditation on death; as an allegory of artistic creation; as Keats&#x27;s response to the Peterloo Massacre, which took place in the same year; and as an expression of nationalist sentiment. One of the most anthologised English lyric poems, &quot;To Autumn&quot; has been regarded by critics as one of the most perfect short poems in the English language.

==Background==
During the spring of 1819, Keats wrote many of his major odes: &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot;, &quot;Ode on Indolence&quot;, &quot;Ode on Melancholy&quot;, &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot;, and &quot;Ode to Psyche&quot;. After the month of May, he began to pursue other forms of poetry, including the verse tragedy &quot;Otho the Great&quot; in collaboration with friend and roommate Charles Brown, the second half of &quot;Lamia&quot;, and a return to his unfinished epic &quot;Hyperion&quot;. His efforts from spring until autumn were dedicated completely to a career in poetry, alternating between writing long and short poems, and setting himself a goal to compose more than fifty lines of verse each day. In his free time he also read works as varied as Robert Burton&#x27;s &quot;The Anatomy of Melancholy&quot;, Thomas Chatterton&#x27;s poetry, and Leigh Hunt&#x27;s essays.

Although Keats managed to write many poems in 1819, he was suffering from a multitude of financial troubles throughout the year, including concerns over his brother, George, who, after emigrating to America, was badly in need of money. Despite these distractions, on 19 September 1819 he found time to write &quot;To Autumn&quot;. The poem marks the final moment of his career as a poet. No longer able to afford to devote his time to the composition of poems, he began working on more lucrative projects. Keats&#x27;s declining health and personal responsibilities also raised obstacles to his continuing poetic efforts.

On 19 September 1819, Keats walked near Winchester along the River Itchen. In a letter to his friend John Hamilton Reynolds written on 21 September, Keats described the impression the scene had made upon him and its influence on the composition of &quot;To Autumn&quot;: &quot;How beautiful the season is now – How fine the air. A temperate sharpness about it [...] I never lik&#x27;d stubble fields so much as now [...] Somehow a stubble plain looks warm – in the same way that some pictures look warm – this struck me so much in my sunday&#x27;s walk that I composed upon it.&quot; Not everything on Keats&#x27;s mind at the time was bright; the poet knew in September that he would have to finally abandon &quot;Hyperion&quot;. Thus, in the letter that he wrote to Reynolds, Keats also included a note saying that he abandoned his long poem. Keats did not send &quot;To Autumn&quot; to Reynolds, but did include the poem within a letter to Richard Woodhouse, his publisher and friend, and dated it on the same day.

The poem was revised and included in Keats&#x27;s 1820 collection of poetry titled &quot;Lamia, Isabella, the Eve of St. Agnes, and Other Poems&quot;. Although the publishers Taylor and Hessey feared the kind of bad reviews that had plagued Keats&#x27;s 1818 edition of &quot;Endymion&quot;, they were willing to publish the collection after the removal of any potentially controversial poems to ensure that there would be no politically motivated reviews that could give the volume a bad reputation.

==Themes==

&quot;To Autumn&quot; describes, in its three stanzas, three different aspects of the season: its fruitfulness, its labour and its ultimate decline. Through the stanzas there is a progression from early autumn to mid autumn and then to the heralding of winter. Parallel to this, the poem depicts the day turning from morning to afternoon and into dusk. These progressions are joined with a shift from the tactile sense to that of sight and then of sound, creating a three-part symmetry which is not present in Keats&#x27;s other odes.

As the poem progresses, Autumn is represented metaphorically as one who conspires, who ripens fruit, who harvests, who makes music. The first stanza of the poem represents Autumn as involved with the promotion of natural processes, growth and ultimate maturation, two forces in opposition in nature, but together creating the impression that the season will not end. In this stanza the fruits are still ripening and the buds still opening in the warm weather. Stuart Sperry says that Keats emphasises the tactile sense here, suggested by the imagery of growth and gentle motion: swelling, bending and plumping.

In the second stanza, Autumn is personified as a harvester, to be seen by the viewer in various guises performing labouring tasks essential to the provision of food for the coming year. There is a lack of definitive action, all motion being gentle. Autumn is not depicted as actually harvesting but as seated, resting or watching. In lines 14–15 the personification of Autumn is as an exhausted labourer. Near the end of the stanza, the steadiness of the gleaner in lines 19–20 again emphasises a motionlessness within the poem. The progression through the day is revealed in actions that are all suggestive of the drowsiness of afternoon: the harvested grain is being winnowed, the harvester is asleep or returning home, the last drops issue from the cider press.

The last stanza contrasts Autumn&#x27;s sounds with those of Spring. The sounds that are presented are not only those of Autumn but essentially the gentle sounds of the evening. Gnats wail and lambs bleat in the dusk. As night approaches within the final moments of the song, death is slowly approaching alongside the end of the year. The full-grown lambs, like the grapes, gourds and hazelnuts, will be harvested for the winter. The twittering swallows gather for departure, leaving the fields bare. The whistling red-breast and the chirping cricket are the common sounds of winter. The references to Spring, the growing lambs and the migrating swallows remind the reader that the seasons are a cycle, widening the scope of this stanza from a single season to life in general.

Of all of Keats&#x27;s poems, &quot;To Autumn&quot;, with its catalogue of concrete images, most closely describes a paradise as realized on earth while also focusing on archetypal symbols connected with the season. Within the poem, autumn represents growth, maturation and finally an approaching death. There is a fulfilling union between the ideal and the real.

Scholars have noted a number of literary influences on &quot;To Autumn&quot;, from Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Georgics&quot;, to Edmund Spenser&#x27;s &quot;Mutability Cantos&quot;, to the language of Thomas Chatterton, to Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;Frost at Midnight&quot;, to an essay on autumn by Leigh Hunt, which Keats had recently read.

&quot;To Autumn&quot; is thematically connected to other odes that Keats wrote in 1819. For example, in his &quot;Ode to Melancholy&quot; a major theme is the acceptance of the process of life. When this theme appears later in &quot;To Autumn&quot;, however, it is with a difference. This time the figure of the poet disappears, and there is no exhortation of an imaginary reader. There are no open conflicts, and &quot;dramatic debate, protest, and qualification are absent&quot;. In process there is a harmony between the finality of death and hints of renewal of life in the cycle of the seasons, paralleled by the renewal of a single day.

Critics have tended to emphasize different aspects of the process. Some have focused on renewal; Walter Jackson Bate points to the theme of each stanza including &quot;its contrary&quot; idea, here death implying, though only indirectly, the renewal of life. Also, noted by both Bate and Jennifer Wagner, the structure of the verse reinforces the sense of something to come; the placing of the couplet before the end of each stanza creates a feeling of suspension, highlighting the theme of continuation.

Others, like Harold Bloom, have emphasized the &quot;exhausted landscape&quot;, the completion, the finality of death, although &quot;Winter descends here as a man might hope to die, with a natural sweetness&quot;. If death in itself is final, here it comes with a lightness, a softness, also pointing to &quot;an acceptance of process beyond the possibility of grief.&quot; The progress of growth is no longer necessary; maturation is complete, and life and death are in harmony. The rich description of the cycle of the seasons enables the reader to feel a belonging &quot;to something larger than the self&quot;, as James O&#x27;Rourke expresses it, but the cycle comes to an end each year, analogous to the ending of single life. O&#x27;Rourke suggests that something of a fear of that ending is subtly implied at the end of the poem, although, unlike the other great odes, in this poem the person of the poet is entirely submerged, so there is at most a faint hint of Keats&#x27;s own possible fear.

According to Helen Vendler, &quot;To Autumn&quot; may be seen as an allegory of artistic creation. As the farmer processes the fruits of the soil into what sustains the human body, so the artist processes the experience of life into a symbolic structure that may sustain the human spirit. This process involves an element of self-sacrifice by the artist, analogous to the living grain&#x27;s being sacrificed for human consumption. In &quot;To Autumn&quot;, as a result of this process, the &quot;rhythms&quot; of the harvesting &quot;artist-goddess&quot; &quot;permeate the whole world until all visual, tactile, and kinetic presence is transubstantiated into Apollonian music for the ear,&quot; the sounds of the poem itself.

In a 1979 essay, Jerome McGann argued that while the poem was indirectly influenced by historical events, Keats had deliberately ignored the political landscape of 1819. Countering this view, Andrew Bennett, Nicholas Roe and others focused on what they believed were political allusions actually present in the poem, Roe arguing for a direct connection to the Peterloo Massacre of 1819. Later, Paul Fry argued against McGann&#x27;s stance when he pointed out, &quot;It scarcely seems pertinent to say that &#x27;To Autumn&#x27; is therefore an evasion of social violence when it is so clearly an encounter with death itself [...] it is not a politically encoded escape from history reflecting the coerced betrayal [...] of its author&#x27;s radicalism. McGann thinks to rescue Keats from the imputation of political naïveté by saying that he was a radical browbeaten into quietism&quot;.

In his 1999 study of the effect on British literature of the diseases and climates of the colonies, Alan Bewell read &quot;the landscape of &#x27;To Autumn as &quot;a kind of biomedical allegory of the coming into being of English climatic space out of its dangerous geographical alternatives.&quot; Britain&#x27;s colonial reach over the previous century and a half had exposed the mother country to foreign diseases and awareness of the dangers of extreme tropical climates. Keats, with medical training, having suffered chronic illness himself, and influenced like his contemporaries by &quot;colonial medical discourse&quot;, was deeply aware of this threat.

According to Bewell, the landscape of &quot;To Autumn&quot; presents the temperate climate of rural England as a healthful alternative to disease-ridden foreign environments. Though the &quot;clammy&quot; aspect of &quot;fever&quot;, the excessive ripeness associated with tropical climates, intrude into the poem, these elements, less prominent than in Keats&#x27;s earlier poetry, are counterbalanced by the dry, crisp autumnal air of rural England. In presenting the particularly English elements of this environment, Keats was also influenced by contemporary poet and essayist Leigh Hunt, who had recently written of the arrival of autumn with its &quot;migration of birds&quot;, &quot;finished harvest&quot;, &quot;cyder [...] making&quot; and migration of &quot;the swallows&quot;, as well as by English landscape painting and the &quot;pure&quot; English idiom of the poetry of Thomas Chatterton.

In &quot;To Autumn&quot;, Bewell argues, Keats was at once voicing &quot;a very personal expression of desire for health&quot; and constructing a &quot;myth of a national environment&quot;. This &quot;political&quot; element in the poem, Bewell points out, has also been suggested by Geoffrey Hartman, who expounded a view of &quot;To Autumn&quot; as &quot;an ideological poem whose form expresses a national idea&quot;.

Thomas McFarland, on the other hand, in 2000 cautioned against overemphasizing the &quot;political, social, or historical readings&quot; of the poem, which distract from its &quot;consummate surface and bloom&quot;. Most important about &quot;To Autumn&quot; is its concentration of imagery and allusion in its evocation of nature, conveying an &quot;interpenetration of livingness and dyingness as contained in the very nature of autumn&quot;.

In 2012 a specific probable location of the cornfield that inspired Keats was discussed in an article by Richard Marggraf Turley, Jayne Archer and Howard Thomas, which draws upon new archival evidence. Traditionally, the water-meadows south of Winchester, along which Keats took daily leisurely walks, were assumed to have provided the sights and sounds of his ode. Marggraf Turley, Archer and Thomas argue that the ode was more directly inspired by Keats&#x27;s visit to St Giles&#x27;s Hill—site of a new cornfield—at the eastern extremity of the city. The land, previously a copse, had recently been turned over to wheat to take advantage of high bread prices. This new topography, the authors argue, enables us to see hitherto unsuspected dimensions to Keats&#x27;s engagement with contemporary politics, in particular as they pertained to the management of food production and supply, wages and productivity.

==Structure==
&quot;To Autumn&quot; is a poem of three stanzas, each of eleven lines. Like others of Keats&#x27;s odes written in 1819, the structure is that of an odal hymn, having three clearly defined sections corresponding to the Classical divisions of strophe, antistrophe, and epode. The stanzas differ from those of the other odes through use of eleven lines rather than ten, and have a couplet placed before the concluding line of each stanza.

&quot;To Autumn&quot; employs poetical techniques which Keats had perfected in the five poems written in the Spring of the same year, but departs from them in some aspects, dispensing with the narrator and dealing with more concrete concepts. There is no dramatic movement in &quot;To Autumn&quot; as there is in many earlier poems; the poem progresses in its focus while showing little change in the objects it is focusing on. There is, in the words of Walter Jackson Bate, &quot;a union of process and stasis&quot;, &quot;energy caught in repose&quot;, an effect that Keats himself termed &quot;stationing&quot;. At the beginning of the third stanza he employs the dramatic Ubi sunt device associated with a sense of melancholy, and questions the personified subject: &quot;Where are the songs of Spring?&quot;

Like the other odes, &quot;To Autumn&quot; is written in iambic pentameter (but greatly modified from the very beginning) with five stressed syllables to a line, each usually preceded by an unstressed syllable. Keats varies this form by the employment of Augustan inversion, sometimes using a stressed syllable followed by an unstressed syllable at the beginning of a line, including the first: &quot;Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness&quot;; and employing spondees in which two stressed syllables are placed together at the beginnings of both the following stanzas, adding emphasis to the questions that are asked: &quot;Who hath not seen thee...&quot;, &quot;Where are the songs...?&quot;

The rhyme of &quot;To Autumn&quot; follows a pattern of starting each stanza with an ABAB pattern which is followed by rhyme scheme of CDEDCCE in the first verse and CDECDDE in the second and third stanzas. In each case, there is a couplet before the final line. Some of the language of &quot;To Autumn&quot; resembles phrases found in earlier poems with similarities to &quot;Endymion&quot;, &quot;Sleep and Poetry&quot;, and &quot;Calidore&quot;. Keats characteristically uses monosyllabic words such as &quot;...how to load and bless with fruit the vines that round the thatch-eves run.&quot; The words are weighted by the emphasis of bilabial consonants (b, m, p), with lines like &quot;...for Summer has o&#x27;er-brimm&#x27;d their clammy cells.&quot; There is also an emphasis on long vowels which control the flow of the poem, giving it a slow measured pace: &quot;...while barred clouds bloom the soft dying day&quot;.

Between the manuscript version and the published version of &quot;To Autumn&quot; Keats tightened the language of the poem. One of Keats&#x27;s changes emphasised by critics is the change in line 17 of &quot;Drows&#x27;d with red poppies&quot; to &quot;Drows&#x27;d with the fume of poppies&quot;, which emphasises the sense of smell instead of sight. The later edition relies more on passive, past participles, as apparent in the change of &quot;While a gold cloud&quot; in line 25 to &quot;While barred clouds&quot;. Other changes involve the strengthening of phrases, especially within the transformation of the phrase in line 13 &quot;whoever seeks for thee may find&quot; into &quot;whoever seeks abroad may find&quot;. Many of the lines within the second stanza were completely rewritten, especially those which did not fit into a rhyme scheme. Some of the minor changes involved adding punctuation missing from the original manuscript copy and altering capitalisation.

==Critical reception==
Critical and scholarly praise has been unanimous in declaring &quot;To Autumn&quot; one of the most perfect poems in the English language. A.C. Swinburne placed it with &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot; as &quot;the nearest to absolute perfection&quot; of Keats&#x27;s odes; Aileen Ward declared it &quot;Keats&#x27;s most perfect and untroubled poem&quot;; and Douglas Bush has stated that the poem is &quot;flawless in structure, texture, tone, and rhythm&quot;; Walter Evert, in 1965, stated that &quot;To Autumn&quot; is &quot;the only perfect poem that Keats ever wrote – and if this should seem to take from him some measure of credit for his extraordinary enrichment of the English poetic tradition, I would quickly add that I am thinking of absolute perfection in whole poems, in which every part is wholly relevant to and consistent in effect with every other part.&quot;

Early reviews of &quot;To Autumn&quot; focused on it as part of Keats&#x27;s collection of poems &quot;Lamia, Isabella, the Eve of St. Agnes, and Other Poems&quot;. An anonymous critic in the July 1820 &quot;Monthly Review&quot; claimed, &quot;this writer is very rich both in imagination and fancy; and even a superabundance of the latter faculty is displayed in his lines &#x27;On Autumn,&#x27; which bring the reality of nature more before our eyes than almost any description that we remember. [...] If we did not fear that, young as is Mr K., his peculiarities are fixed beyond all the power of criticism to remove, we would exhort him to become somewhat less strikingly original,—to be less fond of the folly of too new or too old phrases,—and to believe that poetry does not consist in either the one or the other.&quot; Josiah Conder in the September 1820 &quot;Eclectic Review&quot; mentioned, &quot;One naturally turns first to the shorter pieces, in order to taste the flavour of the poetry. The following ode to Autumn is no unfavourable specimen.&quot; An anonymous reviewer in &quot;The Edinburgh Magazine&quot; for October 1820 added to a discussion of some of Keats&#x27;s longer poems the afterthought that &quot;The ode to &#x27;Fancy,&#x27; and the ode to &#x27;Autumn,&#x27; also have great merit.&quot;

Although, after Keats&#x27;s death, recognition of the merits of his poetry came slowly, by mid century, despite widespread Victorian disapproval of the alleged &quot;weakness&quot; of his character and the view often advanced &quot;that Keats&#x27;s work represented mere sensuality without substance&quot;, some of his poems began to find an appreciative audience, including &quot;To Autumn&quot;. In an 1844 essay on Keats&#x27;s poetry in the &quot;Dumfries Herald&quot;, George Gilfillian placed &quot;To Autumn&quot; among &quot;the finest of Keats&#x27; smaller pieces&quot;. In an 1851 lecture, David Macbeth Moir acclaimed &quot;four exquisite odes,—&#x27;To a Nightingale,&#x27; &#x27;To a Grecian Urn,&#x27; &#x27;To Melancholy,&#x27; and &#x27;To Autumn,&#x27;—all so pregnant with deep thought, so picturesque in their limning, and so suggestive.&quot; In 1865, Matthew Arnold singled out the &quot;indefinable delicacy, charm, and perfection of [...] Keats&#x27;s [touch] in his Autumn&quot;. John Dennis, in an 1883 work about great poets, wrote that &quot;the &#x27;Ode to Autumn&#x27;, ripe with the glory of the season it describes—must ever have a place among the most precious gems of lyrical poetry.&quot; The 1888 Britannica declared, &quot;Of these [odes] perhaps the two nearest to absolute perfection, to the triumphant achievement and accomplishment of the very utmost beauty possible to human words, may be that to Autumn and that on a Grecian Urn&quot;.

At the turn of the 20th century, a 1904 analysis of great poetry by Stephen Gwynn claimed, &quot;above and before all [of Keats&#x27;s poems are] the three odes, &quot;To a Nightingale&quot;, &quot;On a Grecian Urn&quot;, and &quot;To Autumn&quot;. Among these odes criticism can hardly choose; in each of them the whole magic of poetry seems to be contained.&quot; Sidney Colvin, in his 1917 biography, pointed out that &quot;the ode &quot;To Autumn&quot; [...] opens up no such far-reaching avenues to the mind and soul of the reader as the odes &quot;To a Grecian Urn&quot;, &quot;To a Nightingale&quot;, or &quot;On Melancholy&quot;, but in execution is more complete and faultless than any of them.&quot; Following this in a 1934 analysis of Romantic poetry, Margaret Sherwood stated that the poem was &quot;a perfect expression of the phase of primitive feeling and dim thought in regard to earth processes when these are passing into a thought of personality.&quot;

Harold Bloom, in 1961, described &quot;To Autumn&quot; as &quot;the most perfect shorter poem in the English language.&quot; Following this, Walter Jackson Bate, in 1963, claimed that &quot;[...] each generation has found it one of the most nearly perfect poems in English.&quot; Later, in 1973, Stuart Sperry wrote, To Autumn&#x27; succeeds through its acceptance of an order innate in our experience – the natural rhythm of the seasons. It is a poem that, without ever stating it, inevitably suggests the truth of &#x27;ripeness is all&#x27; by developing, with a richness of profundity of implication, the simple perception that ripeness is fall.&quot; In 1981, William Walsh argued that &quot;Among the major Odes [...] no one has questioned the place and supremacy of &#x27;To Autumn&#x27;, in which we see wholly realized, powerfully embodied in art, the complete maturity so earnestly laboured at in Keats&#x27;s life, so persuasively argued about in his letters.&quot; Literary critic and academic Helen Vendler, in 1988, declared that &quot;in the ode &#x27;To Autumn,&#x27; Keats finds his most comprehensive and adequate symbol for the social value of art.&quot;

In 1997, Andrew Motion summarised the critical view on &quot;To Autumn&quot;: &quot;it has often been called Keats&#x27;s &#x27;most ... untroubled poem&#x27; [...] To register the full force of its achievement, its tensions have to be felt as potent and demanding.&quot; Following in 1998, M. H. Abrams explained, To Autumn&#x27; was the last work of artistic consequence that Keats completed [...] he achieved this celebratory poem, with its calm acquiescence to time, transience and mortality, at a time when he was possessed by a premonition [...] that he had himself less than two years to live&quot;. James Chandler, also in 1998, pointed out that &quot;If &quot;To Autumn&quot; is his greatest piece of writing, as has so often been said, it is because in it he arguably set himself the most ambitious challenge of his brief career and managed to meet it.&quot; Timothy Corrigan, in 2000, claimed that To Autumn&#x27; may be, as other critics have pointed out, his greatest achievement in its ability [...] to redeem the English vernacular as the casual expression of everyday experience, becoming in this his most exterior poem even in all its bucolic charm.&quot; In the same year, Thomas McFarland placed &quot;To Autumn&quot; with &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot;, &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot;, &quot;The Eve of St. Agnes&quot; and &quot;Hyperion&quot; as Keats&#x27;s greatest achievement, together elevating Keats &quot;high in the ranks of the supreme makers of world literature&quot;. In 2008, Stanley Plumly wrote, &quot;history, posterity, immortality are seeing &#x27;Ode to a Nightingale,&#x27; &#x27;Ode on a Grecian Urn,&#x27; and &#x27;To Autumn&#x27; as three of the most anthologized lyric poems of tragic vision in English.&quot;

<text>The Pioneer plaques are a pair of gold-anodized aluminum plaques that were placed on board the 1972 &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; and 1973 &quot;Pioneer 11&quot; spacecraft, featuring a pictorial message, in case either &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; or &quot;11&quot; is intercepted by intelligent extraterrestrial life. The plaques show the nude figures of a human male and female along with several symbols that are designed to provide information about the origin of the spacecraft.

The &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; and &quot;11&quot; spacecraft were the first human-built objects to achieve escape velocity from the Solar System. The plaques were attached to the spacecraft&#x27;s antenna support struts in a position that would shield them from erosion by interstellar dust.

==History==
The original idea, that the Pioneer spacecraft should carry a message from mankind, was first mentioned by Eric Burgess when he visited the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, during the Mariner 9 mission. He approached Carl Sagan, who had lectured about communication with intelligent extraterrestrials at a conference in Crimea.

Sagan was enthusiastic about the idea of sending a message with the Pioneer spacecraft. NASA agreed to the plan and gave him three weeks to prepare a message. Together with Frank Drake he designed the plaque, and the artwork was prepared by Linda Salzman Sagan, who was Sagan&#x27;s wife at the time. Additional artistic contributions were made by Jon Lomberg.

Both plaques were manufactured at Precision Engravers, San Carlos, California.

The first plaque was launched with &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; on March 2, 1972, and the second followed with &quot;Pioneer 11&quot; on April 5, 1973.

In May 2017, a limited edition of 200 replicas engraved from the original master design at Precision Engravers was made available in a Kickstarter Campaign, which also offered laser-engraved replicas.

==Symbolism==

===Hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen===

At the top left of the plaque is a schematic representation of the hyperfine transition of hydrogen, which is the most abundant element in the universe. The spin-flip transition of a hydrogen atom&#x27;s electron has a frequency of about 1420.405 MHz, which corresponds to a period of 0.704 ns. Light at this frequency has a vacuum wavelength of (which is also the distance the light travels in that time period). Below the symbol, the small vertical line—representing the binary digit 1—specifies a unit of length (21 cm) as well as a unit of time (0.7 ns). Both units are used as measurements in the other symbols.

===Figures of a man and a woman===

On the right side of the plaque, a nude man and woman are shown in front of the spacecraft. Between the brackets that indicate the height of the woman, the binary representation of the number 8 can be seen (1000). In units of the wavelength of the hyperfine transition of hydrogen this means 8 × 21 cm = .

The small defect in the first zero is only in reproductions of the plaque (like here) and &quot;not&quot; on the original. It probably dates back to a printing error in the original article &quot;A Message from Earth&quot; which is the primary source for many of the copies of the engraving. In the replicas from the 2017 Kickstarter campaign mentioned above the delineation is correct.

The right hand of the man is raised as a sign of good will. Although this gesture may not be understood, it offers a way to show the opposable thumb and how the limbs can be moved.

Originally Sagan intended the humans to be shown holding hands, but soon realized that an extraterrestrial might perceive them as a single creature rather than two organisms.

The original drawings of the figures were based on drawings by Leonardo da Vinci and Greek sculptures.

The woman&#x27;s genitals are not depicted in detail; only the &quot;mons pubis&quot; is shown. It has been claimed that Sagan, having little time to complete the plaque, suspected that NASA would have rejected a more intricate drawing and therefore made a compromise just to be safe. Sagan said that the decision to not include the vertical line on the woman&#x27;s genitalia (pudendal cleft) which would be caused by the intersection of the labia majora was due to two reasons. First, Greek sculptures of women do not include that line. Second, Sagan believed that a design with such an explicit depiction of a woman&#x27;s genitalia would be considered too obscene to be approved by NASA. According to the memoirs of Robert S. Kraemer, however, the original design that was presented to NASA headquarters included a line which indicated the woman&#x27;s vulva, and this line was erased as a condition for approval of the design by John Naugle, former head of NASA&#x27;s Office of Space Science and the agency&#x27;s former chief scientist.

=== Sun and galactic landmarks ===

The radial pattern on the left of the plaque shows 15 lines emanating from the same origin. Fourteen of the lines have corresponding long binary numbers, which stand for the periods of pulsars, using the hydrogen spin-flip transition frequency as the unit. Since these periods will change over time, the epoch of the launch can be calculated from these values.

The lengths of the lines show the relative distances of the pulsars to the Sun. A tick mark at the end of each line gives the Z coordinate perpendicular to the galactic plane.

If the plaque is found, only some of the pulsars may be visible from the location of its discovery. Showing the location with as many as 14 pulsars provides redundancy so that the location of the origin can be triangulated even if only some of the pulsars are recognized.

The data for one of the pulsars is misleading. When the plaque was designed, the frequency of pulsar &quot;1240&quot; (now known as J1243-6423) was known to only three significant decimal digits: 0.388 second. The map lists the period of this pulsar in binary to much greater precision: 100000110110010110001001111000. Rounding this off at about 10 significant bits (100000110100000000000000000000) would have provided a hint of this uncertainty. This pulsar is represented by the long line pointing down and to the right.

The fifteenth line on the plaque extends to the far right, behind the human figures. This line indicates the Sun&#x27;s relative distance to the center of the galaxy.

The pulsar map and hydrogen atom diagram are shared in common with the Voyager Golden Record.

===Solar System===

At the bottom of the plaque is a schematic diagram of the Solar System. A small picture of the spacecraft is shown, and the trajectory shows its way past Jupiter and out of the Solar System. Both &quot;Pioneers 10&quot; and &quot;11&quot; have identical plaques; however, after launch, &quot;Pioneer 11&quot; was redirected toward Saturn and from there it exited the Solar System. In this regard the &quot;Pioneer 11&quot; plaque is inaccurate. The Saturn flyby of &quot;Pioneer 11&quot; also greatly influenced its future direction and destination as compared to &quot;Pioneer 10&quot;, but this fact is not depicted in the plaques.

Saturn&#x27;s rings could give a further hint to identifying the Solar System. Rings around the planets Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune were unknown when the plaque was designed; however these rings are not so easily visible. Pluto was considered to be a planet when the plaque was designed; in 2006 the IAU reclassified Pluto as a dwarf planet. Other bodies classed as dwarf planets, such as Eris were unknown at the time the plaque was made.

The binary numbers above and below the planets show the relative distance to the Sun. The unit is of Mercury&#x27;s orbit. Rather than the familiar &quot;1&quot; and &quot;0&quot;, &quot;I&quot; and &quot;–&quot; are used.

===Silhouette of the spacecraft===

Behind the figures of the human beings, the silhouette of the Pioneer spacecraft is shown in the same scale so that the size of the human beings can be deduced by measuring the spacecraft.

== Criticism ==

One of the parts of the diagram that is among the easiest for humans to understand may be among the hardest for potential extraterrestrial finders to understand: the arrow showing the trajectory of Pioneer. Ernst Gombrich criticized the use of an arrow because arrows are an artifact of hunter-gatherer societies like those on Earth; finders with a different cultural heritage may find the arrow symbol meaningless.

Art critic Craig Owens said that sexual bias is exhibited by the decision to have the man in the diagram perform the raised hand gesture to greet the extraterrestrials while the woman in the diagram has her hands at her sides. Feminists also took issue with this choice for the same reason. To appease these criticisms, a second illustration of a similar couple was provided, with the woman raising her hand instead.

Carl Sagan regretted that the figures in the finished engraving failed to look panracial. Although this was the intent, the final figures were criticized for looking too white. Both had broad and flattened noses, and the woman was given epicanthial folds to resemble East Asian people. In the original drawing, the man was drawn with an &quot;Afro&quot; haircut, so an additional African physical trait would be included in the man to make the figures look more panracial, but that detail was changed to a &quot;non-African Mediterranean-curly haircut&quot; in the finished engraving. Furthermore, Carl Sagan said that Linda Sagan intended to portray both the man and woman as having brown hair, but the hair being only outlined, rather than being both outlined and shaded made their hair appear blonde instead. Other people had different interpretations of the race of people depicted by the figures. White people, Black people and East Asian people each tended to think that the figures resembled their own racial group, so, although some people were proud that their race appeared to have been selected to represent all of humankind, others viewed the figures as &quot;terribly racist&quot; for &quot;the apparently blatant exclusion&quot; of other races.

Linda Sagan decided to make the figures nude to address the problem of the type of clothes they should wear to represent all of humanity and to make the figures more anatomically educational for extraterrestrials, but some viewed their nudity as pornographic. According to astronomer Frank Drake, there were many negative reactions to the plaque because the human beings were displayed naked. When images of the final design were published in American newspapers, one newspaper published the image with the man&#x27;s genitalia removed and another newspaper published the image with both the man&#x27;s genitalia and the woman&#x27;s nipples removed. In one letter to a newspaper, a person angrily wrote that they felt that the nudity of the images made the images obscene. In contrast, in another letter to the same newspaper, a person was critical of the prudishness of the people who found depictions of nudity to be obscene. There have also been criticisms of the censorship of the female figure&#x27;s genitals. Scientist and artist Joe Davis protested the depiction with his &quot;Poetica Vaginal&quot; project wherein he used an MIT radar dish to transmit the recordings of a vaginal detector.

<text>The Norwich school of painters was the first provincial art movement established in Britain, active in the early 19th century. Artists of the school were inspired by the natural environment of the Norfolk landscape and owed some influence to the work of landscape painters of the Dutch Golden Age such as Hobbema and Ruisdael.

==History==

The Norwich Society of Artists was founded in 1803 by John Crome and Robert Ladbrooke as a club where artists could meet to exchange ideas. Its aims were &quot;an enquiry into the rise, progress and present state of painting, architecture, and sculpture, with a view to point out the best methods of study to attain the greater perfection in these arts.&quot; The society&#x27;s first meeting was in &quot;The Hole in the Wall&quot; tavern; two years later it moved to premises which allowed it to offer members work and exhibition space. Its first exhibition opened in 1805, and was such a success that it became an annual event until 1825. The building was demolished but the society re-opened three years later, in 1828, as &quot;The Norfolk and Suffolk Institution for the Promotion of the Fine Arts&quot; at a different venue and exhibitions continued until 1833.

The leading light of the movement was John Crome who attracted many friends and pupils until his death in 1821. The mantle of leadership then fell on John Sell Cotman, a member of the society since 1807, who continued to keep the society together until he left Norwich for London in 1834. The society effectively ceased to exist from that date.

The Norwich school&#x27;s great achievement was that a small group of self-taught working class artists were able to paint with vitality the hinterland surrounding Norwich, assisted by meagre local patronage. Far from creating pastiches of the Dutch 17th century, Crome and Cotman, along with Joseph Stannard, established a school of landscape painting which deserves greater fame; the broad washes of J.S. Cotman&#x27;s water-colours anticipate French impressionism.

One reason the Norwich school artists are not so well known as other painters of the period, notably Constable and Turner, is because the majority of their canvases were collected by the industrialist J. J. Colman (of Colman&#x27;s mustard fame), and have been on permanent display in Norwich Castle Museum since the 1880s. This lack of wider exposure was remedied in 2001, when many of the school&#x27;s major works were exhibited outside Norwich for the first time at the Tate Gallery, London in 2000.

<text>The comptroller and auditor general (C&amp;AG) in the United Kingdom is the government official responsible for supervising the quality of public accounting and financial reporting. The C&amp;AG is an officer of the House of Commons who is the head of the National Audit Office, the body that scrutinises central government expenditure.

Under the Budget Responsibility and National Audit Act 2011 the C&amp;AG is appointed by the monarch by letters patent upon an address of the House of Commons presented by the Prime Minister with the agreement of the Chair of the Public Accounts Committee. The C&amp;AG can be removed from office, also by the monarch, only upon an address of both Houses of Parliament.

The full title of the office is &quot;Comptroller General of the Receipt and Issue of His Majesty&#x27;s Exchequer and Auditor General of Public Accounts&quot;.

The current C&amp;AG is Gareth Davies (not the MP).

==History==
The office of C&amp;AG was created by the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1866, which combined the functions of the Comptroller General of the Exchequer, who had authorised the issue of public moneys from the Treasury to other government departments, with those of the Commissioners of Audit, who had presented the government accounts to the Treasury). Under the terms of the Act the C&amp;AG continued to authorise the issue of money to departments, but was also given the new task of examining departmental accounts and reporting the results to Parliament. The role has since been replicated in many Commonwealth and foreign countries.

<text>Canadian poetry is poetry of or typical of Canada. The term encompasses poetry written in Canada or by Canadian people in the official languages of English and French, and an increasingly prominent body of work in both other European and Indigenous languages.

Although English Canadian poetry began to be written soon after European colonization began, many of English-speaking Canada’s first celebrated poets come from the Confederation period of the mid to late 19th century. In the 20th century, Anglo-Canadian poets embraced European and American poetic innovations, such as Modernism, Confessional poetry, Postmodernism, New Formalism, Concrete and Visual poetry, and Slam, but always turned to a uniquely Canadian perspective.

The minority French Canadian poetry, primarily from Quebec, blossomed in the 19th century, moving through Modernism and Surrealism in the 20th century, to develop a unique voice filled with passion, politics and vibrant imagery.

Montreal, with its exposure to both English and French poetry, became a hotbed of poetic progress with movements such as the Montreal Group and Les Automatistes, and notable poets such as Irving Layton and Leonard Cohen. Toronto (centered on the Bohemian Embassy Coffee House and bpNichol’s grOnk) and Vancouver (with the Downtown Poets and the TISH group) also developed as important poetry centers.

In the later 20th century, a growing awareness of Native identity coupled with the struggle for Indigenous rights, fostered the growth of writing by Native Canadians.

==English-Canadian poetry==

===Beginnings===
The earliest works of poetry, mainly written by visitors, described the new territories in optimistic terms, mainly targeted at a European audience. One of the first works was Robert Hayman&#x27;s &quot;Quodlibets&quot;, composed in Newfoundland and published in 1628.

With the growth of English language communities near the end of the 18th century, poetry aimed at local readers began to appear in local newspapers. These writings were mainly intended to reflect the prevailing cultural values of the time and were modeled after English poetry of the same period.

Oliver Goldsmith&#x27;s long poem &quot;The Rising Village&quot; appeared in 1825. It was a response to &quot;The Deserted Village&quot; by his namesake and great-uncle Oliver Goldsmith.

In the first half of the 19th century, poetic works began to reflect local subjects. &quot;Acadia&quot; by Joseph Howe and &quot;The Saint Lawrence and the Saguenay&quot; by Charles Sangster are examples of this trend. Early nationalistic verses were composed by writers including Thomas D&#x27;Arcy McGee. Many &quot;regional&quot; poets also espoused the British political and aesthetic jingoism of the period. For example, High Tory loyalist &amp; occasional poet Thomas H. Higginson of Vankleek Hill, Ontario, produced paeans to Sir Francis Bond Head (Wm. Lyon Mackenzie&#x27;s opponent) and the British war effort in the Crimea (such as &quot;Sonnet to Florence Nightingale&quot; and others), while producing some interesting nature verse exemplifying the all-pervasive influence of Wordsworth&#x27;s view of nature and the sublime.

In 1857, Charles Heavysege attracted international (British and American) attention for his verse drama &quot;Mari na de Saul&quot;.

===Confederation===
The first book of poetry published in Canada following the formation of the new Dominion of Canada in 1867 was &quot;Dreamland&quot; by Charles Mair (1868).

A group of poets now known as the &quot;Confederation Poets&quot;, including Charles G. D. Roberts, Archibald Lampman, Bliss Carman, Duncan Campbell Scott, and William Wilfred Campbell, came to prominence in the 1880s and 1890s. Choosing the world of nature as their inspiration, their work was drawn from their own experiences and, at its best, written in their own tones. Isabella Valancy Crawford, Frederick George Scott, Francis Sherman, and Annie Campbell Huestis are also sometimes associated with this group.

During this period, E. Pauline Johnson and William Henry Drummond were writing popular poetry - Johnson&#x27;s based on her part-Mohawk heritage, and Drummond, the Poet of the Habitant, writing dialect verse.

===Early 20th century===
In 1907 Robert W. Service&#x27;s &quot;Songs of a Sourdough&quot;, Kipling-type verse about the Klondike Gold Rush, became enormously popular: the book would go on to sell more than three million copies in the 20th century. His success would be inspired many other poets, such as Tom MacInnes.

Marjorie Pickthall received much critical attention in this period.
In 1915, John McCrae, serving as a surgeon in the Canadian Army, wrote the famous war poem &quot;In Flanders Fields&quot;.

After the war, in Newfoundland, E. J. Pratt described the struggle to make a living from the sea in poems about maritime life and the history of Canada; while in central Canada, poets such as Ralph Gustafson and Raymond Knister were moving away from traditional verse forms.

During the 1920s and 1930s, the Montreal Group (a circle of young poets which included A.J.M. Smith, A.M. Klein, and F. R. Scott) helped inspire the development of modernist poetry in Montreal through the &quot;McGill Fortnightly Review&quot; and the 1936 anthology &quot;New Provinces&quot;. The &quot;new poetry&quot; valued intellect over sentimentality, or as some have put it, logic over human emotions. Under the literary editorship of Earle Birney, the &quot;Canadian Forum&quot; helped promote similar developments in Toronto. Dorothy Livesay, born in Manitoba, was an important contributor to the Toronto movement.

The Maritimes remained a holdout for traditional verse. The Song Fishermen of Halifax were a magnet for new poetic talent in the late 1920s due to having Bliss Carman and Charles G.D. Roberts as members. The most notable of the new poets were the sonneteers Kenneth Leslie and Robert Norwood.

The &quot;Canadian Poetry Magazine&quot; was founded by Pelham Edgar of the Canadian Authors Association in 1936.
Traditional verse was what sold in Canada all through this period; and it was what &quot;Canadian Poetry Magazine&quot; emphasized. Wilson MacDonald was a top selling Canadian poet of the time.

===Post-war===
Following World War II, a new breed of poets appeared, writing for a well-educated audience. These included James Reaney, Jay Macpherson and Leonard Cohen. Meanwhile, some maturing authors such as Irving Layton, Raymond Souster, and Louis Dudek, moved in a different direction, adopting colloquial speech in their work.

In the 1960s, a renewed sense of nation helped foster new voices: Margaret Atwood, Michael Ondaatje, Leonard Cohen, Alden Nowlan Eli Mandel and Margaret Avison. Others such as Al Purdy, Milton Acorn, and Earle Birney, already published, produced some of their best work during this period.

The late 1960s and early 1970s saw greater experimentation from poets such as bpNichol, Lionel Kearns, David UU, Joe Rosenblatt, Steve McCaffery, Judith Copithorne and bill bissett. The TISH Poetry movement in Vancouver brought about poetic innovation from Jamie Reid, George Bowering, Fred Wah, Frank Davey, Daphne Marlatt, and David Cull.

Since the 1990s, several Governor General&#x27;s Award-winning poets, in particular Jan Zwicky and Tim Lilburn, have been engaged in nonfiction writing that maps the relationships between poetry and philosophy. Zwicky&#x27;s &quot;Lyric Philosophy&quot; and &quot;Wisdom and Metaphor&quot;, as well as Lilburn&#x27;s collection &quot;Thinking and Singing&quot;, are representative works.

A younger generation of Canadian poets has been expanding the boundaries of originality: Brian Brett, Ken Babstock, Karen Solie, Lynn Crosbie, Patrick Lane, Stuart Ross, Sonnet L&#x27;Abbé, George Elliott Clarke and Barry Dempster have all imprinted their unique consciousnesses onto the map of Canadian imagery.

A notable anthology of Canadian poetry is &quot;The New Oxford book of Canadian Verse&quot;, edited by Margaret Atwood ().

===Literary prizes===
Notable literary prizes for English Canadian poetry include the Governor General&#x27;s Awards, the Griffin Poetry Prize, the Gerald Lampert Award, and the Pat Lowther Award.

===Uniquely Canadian forms===

====Jackpine Sonnet====
The &quot;Jackpine Sonnet&quot; is a form devised by Milton Acorn, designed to be as irregular and spikey (and Canadian) as a jack pine tree, but with internal structure and integrity. Of no fixed length and with erratic line lengths, the &quot;Jackpine Sonnet&quot; depends on interweaving internal rhymes, assonance and occasional end-rhymes.

====Mirelle====
Tom MacInnes reportedly invented &quot;a five-line stanza of his own he called the &#x27;mirelle&#x27;.&quot;

====Viator====
The Viator poem form was invented by British author and poet Robin Skelton. It consists of any stanzaic form in which the first line of the first stanza is the second line of the second stanza and so on until the poem ends with the line with which it began. The term, &quot;Viator&quot; comes from the Latin for &quot;traveller&quot;. An example of Skelton&#x27;s form may be found in his reference book, &quot;The Shapes of our Singing&quot;, and is entitled &quot;Dover Beach Revisited&quot;.

==French-Canadian poetry==

===Early verse===
The first book written in verse by a Canadian was &quot;Épîtres, Satires, Chansons, Épigrammes et Autres Pièces de vers&quot; by Michel Bibaud, published in 1830.

===Mouvement littéraire===
A group of French-speaking poets and authors belonging to the Mouvement littéraire came to Ottawa from Quebec City when the civil service moved to Ottawa in 1870. This group included Alfred Garneau, Antoine Gerin-Lajoie, Achilles Frechette and others. They are considered some of the most important poets and writers in 19th Century French Canada.

===End of 19th century===
Octave Crémazie is considered the father of French Canadian poetry. His poetry and that of his follower Louis Fréchette are romantic of form and patriotic in inspiration. At the same time, Pamphile Le May was writing intimist poetry about the simple farm life and Alfred Garneau wrote his feelings.

===The Montreal School===
&quot;L&#x27;École littéraire de Montréal&quot; was not a literary school but a group of poets that met regularly. In reaction to the earlier following of the romantic Victor Hugo, they took later schools (such as the Parnassian or symbolism) as their masters. The group included Émile Nelligan, a young poet who stopped writing at only 19 years of age due to mental illness.

===The &quot;terroir&quot;===
Outside Montreal, other poets, such as Nérée Beauchemin (1850–1931) continued Pamphile Le May&#x27;s depiction of the life of the &quot;habitants,&quot; followed by Alfred Desrochers (1901–1978), a precursor to the &quot;pays&quot; school of poetry of Gaston Miron.

In 1937, Hector de Saint-Denys Garneau published the first book of modernist poetry in French Canada, &quot;Regards et Jeux dans l&#x27;espace.&quot; Garneau&#x27;s reputation increased in the 1950s after publication of his &quot;Complete Poems&quot; (1949) - as would that of his cousin, poet Anne Hébert (1916–2000).

===Surrealism===
In 1944, Surrealist André Breton travelled to Québec, where he wrote &quot;Arcane 17&quot;. His visit had a profound effect on Québec literature and provided the impetus for the first Surrealist poetry published in Canada, &quot;Les Sables du rêve&quot; (The Sands of Dream) by Thérèse Renaud, with drawings by Jean-Paul Mousseau, published by Les Cahiers de la files indienne in 1946.

This was followed by the formation of Les Automatistes movement, a militant group of poets, painters and dancers, and the Surrealist-inspired manifesto Refus Global of 1948. A strong Surrealist influence continued in Québec, culminating in the work of poets Paul-Marie Lapointe and Claude Gauvreau.

<text>Robert White Creeley (May 21, 1926 – March 30, 2005) was an American poet and author of more than 60 books. He is associated with the Black Mountain poets, although his verse aesthetic diverged from that school. Creeley was close with Charles Olson, Robert Duncan, Allen Ginsberg, John Wieners and Ed Dorn.

Creeley served as the Samuel P. Capen Professor of Poetry and the Humanities at State University of New York at Buffalo. In 1991, he joined colleagues Susan Howe, Charles Bernstein, Raymond Federman, Robert Bertholf, and Dennis Tedlock in founding the Poetics Program at Buffalo.

Creeley lived in Waldoboro, Buffalo, and Providence, where he taught at Brown University. He was a recipient of the Lannan Foundation Lifetime Achievement Award.

== Early life ==
Creeley was born in Arlington, Massachusetts, and grew up in Acton. He and his sister, Helen, were raised by their mother. At the age of two, he lost his left eye. He attended the Holderness School in New Hampshire. In 1943, he entered Harvard University, but left to serve in the American Field Service in Burma and India in 1944–1945. He returned to Harvard in 1946, but eventually earned his BA from Black Mountain College in 1955, teaching some courses there as well. After teaching in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Creeley visited San Francisco for two months in the spring of 1956, having heard from Kenneth Rexroth about a local poetic &quot;renaissance&quot; underway. There he met Allen Ginsberg, who had recently completed &quot;Howl&quot;, and befriended Jack Kerouac. Creeley later met and befriended Jackson Pollock at the Cedar Tavern in New York City.
He was a chicken farmer briefly in Littleton, New Hampshire, before becoming a teacher in 1949. The story goes that he wrote to Cid Corman, whose radio show he heard on the farm, and Corman had him read on the show, which is how Charles Olson first heard of Creeley.

== Work ==
From 1951 to 1955, Creeley and his wife, Ann, lived with their three children on the Spanish island of Mallorca. They went there at the encouragement of their friends, British writer Martin and his partner, Janet Seymour-Smith. There they started Divers Press and published works by Paul Blackburn, Robert Duncan, Charles Olson, and others. Creeley wrote about half of his published prose while living on the island, including a short-story collection, &quot;The Gold Diggers,&quot; and a novel, &quot;The Island&quot;. He said that Martin and Janet Seymour-Smith are represented by Artie and Marge in the novel. During 1954 and 1955, Creeley traveled back and forth between Mallorca and his teaching position at Black Mountain College. He also saw to the printing of some issues of &quot;Origin&quot; and Black Mountain Review on Mallorca, because the printing costs were significantly lower there.

In 1960, Creeley earned an MA from the University of New Mexico. He began his academic career by teaching at the prestigious Albuquerque Academy starting in 1958 until about 1960 or 1961. In 1957, he met Bobbie Louise Hawkins; they lived together in a common law marriage until 1975 and had two children, Sarah and Katherine. He dedicated his book &quot;For Love&quot; to Bobbie.

Creeley read at the 1963 Vancouver Poetry Festival and at the 1965 Berkeley Poetry Conference. Afterward, he wandered about a bit before settling into the English faculty of &quot;Black Mountain II&quot; at the University at Buffalo in 1967. He would stay at this post until 2003, when he received a post at Brown University. From 1990 to 2003, he lived with his family in Black Rock neighborhood of Buffalo, New York, in a converted firehouse at the corner of Amherst and East Streets. At the time of his death, he was in residence with the Lannan Foundation in Marfa, Texas.
Creeley first received fame in 1962 from his poetry collection &quot;For Love&quot;. He would go on to win the Bollingen Prize, among others, and to hold the position of New York State Poet laureate from 1989 until 1991. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2003.

In 1968, he signed the &quot;Writers and Editors War Tax Protest&quot; pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.

In his later years he was an advocate of, and a mentor to, many younger poets, as well as to others outside of the poetry world. He went to great lengths to be supportive to many people regardless of any poetic affiliation. Being responsive appeared to be essential to his personal ethics, and he seemed to take this responsibility extremely seriously, in both his life and his craft. In his later years, when he became well-known, he would go to lengths to make strangers, who approached him as a well-known author, feel comfortable. In his last years, he used the Internet to keep in touch with many younger poets and friends.

== Death ==
Robert Creeley died in the morning of March 30, 2005, in Odessa, Texas of complications from pneumonia. He is buried in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

In 2016, a short documentary was made about Robert Creeley&#x27;s son, Will Creeley, in which Will shared stories of his father&#x27;s legacy and their relationship. The film was entitled &quot;For Will&quot;.

== Poetry ==
Arthur L. Ford in his book &quot;Robert Creeley&quot; (1978, p. 25) describes the poet, 

&quot;Le Fou&quot;, Creeley&#x27;s first book, was published in 1952, and since then, according to his publisher, barely a year passed without a new collection of poems. The 1983 entry, titled &quot;Mirrors&quot;, had some tendencies toward concrete imagery. It was hard for many readers and critics to immediately understand Creeley&#x27;s reputation as an innovative poet, for his innovations were often very subtle; even harder for some to imagine that his work lived up to the Black Mountain tenet—which he articulated to Charles Olson in their correspondence, and which Olson popularized in his essay &quot;Projective Verse,&quot;—that &quot;form is never more than an extension of content,&quot; for his poems were often written in couplet, triplet, and quatrain stanzas that break into and out of rhyme as happenstance appears to dictate. An example is &quot;The Hero,&quot; from &quot;Collected Poems&quot;, also published in 1982 and covering the span of years from 1945 to 1975.

&quot;The Hero&quot; is written in variable isoverbal (&quot;word-count&quot;) prosody; the number of words per line varies from three to seven, but the norm is four to six. Another technique to be found in this piece is variable rhyme—there is no set rhyme scheme, but some of the lines rhyme and the poem concludes with a rhymed couplet. All of the stanzas are quatrains, as in the first two:

Despite these obviously formal elements various critics continue to insist that Creeley wrote in &quot;free verse&quot;, but most of his forms were strict enough so that it is a question whether it can even be maintained that he wrote in forms of prose. This particular poem is verse-mode, not prose-mode. M. L. Rosenthal in his book &quot;The New Poets&quot; quoted Creeley&#x27;s &quot;preoccupation with a personal rhythm in the sense that the discovery of an external equivalent of the speaking self is felt to be the true object of poetry,&quot; and went on to say that this speaking self serves both as the center of the poem&#x27;s universe and the private life of the poet. &quot;Despite his mask of humble, confused comedian, loving and lovable, he therefore stands in his own work&#x27;s way, too seldom letting his poems free themselves of his blocking presence&quot; (p. 148). When he used imagery, Creeley could be interesting and effective on the sensory level.

In an essay titled &quot;Poetry: Schools of Dissidents,&quot; the academic poet Daniel Hoffman wrote, in &quot;The Harvard Guide to Contemporary American Writing&quot;, which he edited, that as he grew older, Creeley&#x27;s work tended to become increasingly fragmentary in nature, even the titles subsequent to &quot;For Love: Poems 1950–1960&quot; hinting at the fragmentation of experience in Creeley&#x27;s work: &quot;Words, Pieces, A Day Book&quot;. In Hoffman&#x27;s opinion, &quot;Creeley has never included ideas, or commitments to social issues, in the repertoire of his work; his stripped-down poems have been, as it were, a proving of Pound&#x27;s belief in &#x27;technique as the test of a man&#x27;s sincerity&#x27;&quot; (p. 533).

In 1979, jazz bassist Steve Swallow released the album &quot;Home&quot; (ECM) featuring poems by Creeley set to music, and Creeley later collaborated with Swallow on three further albums, including &quot;So There&quot; (ECM, 2005).

Early work by Creeley appeared in the avant-garde literary magazine &quot;Nomad&quot; at the beginning of the 1960s. Posthumous publications of Creeley&#x27;s work have included the second volume of his &quot;Collected Poems&quot;, which was published in 2006, and &quot;The Selected Letters of Robert Creeley&quot; edited by Rod Smith, Kaplan Harris and Peter Baker, published in 2014 by the University of California Press.

<doc id="236283" wikidata="Q742195" url="?curid=236283" title="Secretary (2002 film)">
<text>Secretary is a 2002 American erotic romantic comedy-drama film directed by Steven Shainberg from a screenplay by Erin Cressida Wilson, based on the 1988 short story of the same name by Mary Gaitskill. Starring Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader, the film explores the intense relationship between a dominant lawyer and his submissive secretary, who indulge in various types of BDSM activities such as erotic spanking and petplay.

==Plot==
Lee Holloway is the socially awkward and emotionally sensitive youngest daughter of a dysfunctional family. After having been committed to a mental hospital following an extreme incident of self-harm, she attempts to readjust to normal life.

Lee learns to type and applies for a job as a secretary for an eccentric yet demanding attorney, E. Edward Grey. Grey explains she is overqualified for the job, having scored higher than anyone he has ever interviewed, and that it is &quot;very dull work&quot; as they only use typewriters; Lee, however, agrees to work under these conditions as she &quot;likes dull work&quot;.

Though at first Grey appears to be highly irritated by Lee&#x27;s typos and other clerical errors, it soon becomes apparent that he is sexually aroused by her obedient behavior. When Grey discovers her propensity for self-harm, he confronts her and commands that she never hurt herself again. One day, Grey makes her bend over his desk and spanks her after she makes a spelling error in a letter; Lee finds herself excited by the ordeal.

The two soon embark on a BDSM relationship from their typical employer–employee dynamic. Lee experiences a sexual and personal awakening through the sadomasochistic sexual encounters with Grey and falls deeply in love with him. Conversely, Grey displays insecurity concerning his feelings for Lee, as well as shame and disgust over his sexual habits. He begins to withdraw from her, despite her intentionally continuing to make typing errors in the hopes of receiving more corporal punishment.

During this period of exploration with Grey, Lee also attempts to have a more conventional relationship with family friend Peter. She engages in lukewarm sex with him, during which he is confused by her desire to be spanked. After Lee sends Grey an envelope with a worm in it, he bends her over his desk and makes her remove her skirt and underwear, then masturbates behind her and ejaculates onto her bare legs. Following this encounter, Grey fires Lee.

Peter later proposes to Lee, who reluctantly accepts. However, while trying on her wedding gown, she flees and runs to Grey&#x27;s office to declare her love for him. Grey, still uncertain about their relationship, tests Lee by commanding her to sit in his chair without moving her hands or feet until he returns. Lee willingly complies, despite being forced to urinate in her dress since she is not allowed to use the toilet.

Hours pass as several family members and friends individually visit Lee to alternately attempt to dissuade or encourage her while Grey watches from afar, completely taken by Lee&#x27;s compliance. Her refusal to leave the office, believed to be a hunger strike, draws media attention.

Three days later, Grey returns to the office and takes Lee upstairs, where he bathes and feeds her. The pair marry and happily continue their dominant–submissive relationship.

==Cast==
==Production==
Many changes were made from Mary Gaitskill&#x27;s original short story, which was significantly expanded and given greater depth to be made into a feature-length film. Lines of dialogue were changed; Lee&#x27;s statement &quot;I&#x27;m so stupid&quot; became the fantasy-sequence cry &quot;I&#x27;m your secretary&quot;, which the director thought far more &quot;celebratory&quot;. Additionally, the ending of the story was changed to give a more positive outcome to the relationship. Steven Shainberg stated that he wished to show that BDSM relationships can be normal and was inspired by the film &quot;My Beautiful Laundrette&quot;, which he feels normalized gay relationships for audiences in the 1980s.

A central component to the film, the office spaces of Edward and Lee, took form after two years of planning by Shainberg and production designer Amy Danger, who had collaborated with Shainberg on several projects. The desire to have the office feel homemade and express Edward&#x27;s interest in the growing of plants led Danger to juxtapose a natural decor in the office with a predominantly artificial outside world. Speaking of her choices, Danger compares the office with the rest of the film&#x27;s locations: &quot;All the materials I used [in the office] were natural: natural wood, bamboo, ironwork ... If I wasn&#x27;t using natural materials, it was natural colors, like [in] the botanical wallpaper.&quot; In contrast, &quot;everything [in the larger world] was fake ... I covered Lee&#x27;s house in plastic sheeting, and used artificial, manufactured colors.&quot;
Although the interior sets were carefully constructed, the filmmakers did face some location-related challenges. Notably, in one instance the filmmakers accidentally obtained shooting rights for the wrong park. Gyllenhaal encouraged them to hastily shoot the required park scene anyway, without permission, while crew members distracted the local police.

Speaking about &quot;Secretary&quot;″s tone and atmosphere, Danger says &quot;With this S&amp;M material, we could go into a dark place... Steve and I wanted the total opposite: that the nature of this relationship freed [the characters] to be their natural selves.&quot; Because of this atmosphere, Danger says &quot;Everybody kept saying, &#x27;When are we going back to the office?&#x27; It was funny, because the rooms weren&#x27;t any smaller in the house, and it wasn&#x27;t any more difficult to shoot. It was because you wanted to be in that space.&quot;

=== Filming ===
Despite being set in Florida, filming took place in Los Angeles.

==Release==
===Theatrical===
The film premiered at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival, where it won a Special Jury Prize Award for Originality for Steven Shainberg. It was subsequently acquired by Lions Gate Films for theatrical release. It also went on to screen at the Toronto International Film Festival later that year. The film opened in limited release in the United States on September 20, 2002, as well as in various foreign markets in 2003 and 2004.

===Home media===
The film&#x27;s region 1 DVD was released on April 1, 2003. In the UK, a version by Tartan Video was released on January 5, 2004, followed by a budget edition by Prism Leisure on February 7, 2005. A Blu-ray Disc was released on October 4, 2010.

Special features on the Blu-ray include the film&#x27;s trailer and TV spots, cast and director interviews, a behind-the-scenes documentary, cast and director &quot;Curricula Vitae&quot; and an audio commentary by director Steven Shainberg and writer Erin Cressida Wilson.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 78% based on 157 reviews, with an average rating of 6.8/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Maggie Gyllenhaal impresses in this romantic comedy with a kinky twist.&quot; Many critics noted the film&#x27;s original take on themes of sadomasochism, with Roger Ebert saying that the film &quot;approaches the tricky subject ... with a stealthy tread, avoiding the dangers of making it either too offensive, or too funny&quot;. Ain&#x27;t It Cool News commented: &quot;Perhaps there is something bold about saying that pain can bring healing as long as it&#x27;s applied by the right hand, but even that seems obvious and even normal thanks to Gyllenhaal.&quot;

===Box office===
The film grossed $4.1 million in the United States and Canada, and $9.3 million worldwide.

===Controversy===
The film&#x27;s exploration of a BDSM romantic relationship and Spader&#x27;s character bearing the last name &quot;Grey&quot; have drawn comparisons to the &quot;Fifty Shades of Grey&quot; franchise, with some suspecting the former inspired the E. L. James series.

==Accolades==
&quot;Secretary&quot; was nominated for a number of awards and won several, with numerous wins for Maggie Gyllenhaal&#x27;s breakthrough performance.

==Soundtrack==
The film&#x27;s soundtrack album was released on CD on October 8, 2002, with an MP3 download version released on July 11, 2006. The soundtrack album contains Angelo Badalamenti&#x27;s score as well as two songs that were notably featured over erotic montages in the film: Leonard Cohen&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Your Man&quot; and Lizzie West&#x27;s &quot;Chariots Rise&quot;.

The song &quot;Chariots Rise&quot; was changed slightly for the film, with the lyric &quot;what a fool am I, to fall so in love&quot; changed to &quot;&quot;what grace have I&quot;, to fall so in love&quot;.

<text>Scottish literature is literature written in Scotland or by Scottish writers. It includes works in English, Scottish Gaelic, Scots, Brythonic, French, Latin, Norn or other languages written within the modern boundaries of Scotland.

The earliest extant literature written in what is now Scotland, was composed in Brythonic speech in the sixth century and has survived as part of Welsh literature. In the following centuries there was literature in Latin, under the influence of the Catholic Church, and in Old English, brought by Anglian settlers. As the state of Alba developed into the kingdom of Scotland from the eighth century, there was a flourishing literary elite who regularly produced texts in both Gaelic and Latin, sharing a common literary culture with Ireland and elsewhere. After the Davidian Revolution of the thirteenth century a flourishing French language culture predominated, while Norse literature was produced from areas of Scandinavian settlement. The first surviving major text in Early Scots literature is the fourteenth-century poet John Barbour&#x27;s epic &quot;Brus&quot;, which was followed by a series of vernacular versions of medieval romances. These were joined in the fifteenth century by Scots prose works.

In the early modern era royal patronage supported poetry, prose and drama. James V&#x27;s court saw works such as Sir David Lindsay of the Mount&#x27;s &quot;The Thrie Estaitis&quot;. In the late sixteenth century James VI became patron and member of a circle of Scottish court poets and musicians known as the Castalian Band. When he acceded to the English throne in 1603 many followed him to the new court, but without a centre of royal patronage the tradition of Scots poetry subsided. It was revived after union with England in 1707 by figures including Allan Ramsay and James Macpherson. The latter&#x27;s Ossian Cycle made him the first Scottish poet to gain an international reputation. He helped inspire Robert Burns, considered by many to be the national poet, and Walter Scott, whose Waverley Novels did much to define Scottish identity in the nineteenth century. Towards the end of the Victorian era a number of Scottish-born authors achieved international reputations, including Robert Louis Stevenson, Arthur Conan Doyle, J. M. Barrie and George MacDonald.

In the twentieth century there was a surge of activity in Scottish literature, known as the Scottish Renaissance. The leading figure, Hugh MacDiarmid, attempted to revive the Scots language as a medium for serious literature. Members of the movement were followed by a new generation of post-war poets including Edwin Morgan, who would be appointed the first Scots Makar by the inaugural Scottish government in 2004. From the 1980s Scottish literature enjoyed another major revival, particularly associated with writers including James Kelman and Irvine Welsh. Scottish poets who emerged in the same period included Carol Ann Duffy, who was named as the first Scot to be UK Poet Laureate in May 2009.

==Middle Ages==
===Early Middle Ages===
After the collapse of Roman authority in the early fifth century, four major circles of political and cultural influence emerged in Northern Britain. In the east were the Picts, whose kingdoms eventually stretched from the river Forth to Shetland. In the west were the Gaelic (Goidelic)-speaking people of Dál Riata, who had close links with Ireland, from where they brought with them the name Scots. In the south were the British (Brythonic-speaking) descendants of the peoples of the Roman-influenced kingdoms of &quot;The Old North&quot;, the most powerful and longest surviving of which was the Kingdom of Strathclyde. Finally, there were the English or &quot;Angles&quot;, Germanic invaders who had overrun much of southern Britain and held the Kingdom of Bernicia (later the northern part of Northumbria), which reached into what are now the Lothians and the Scotiish Borders in the south-east. To these Christianisation, particularly from the sixth century, added Latin as an intellectual and written language. Modern scholarship, based on surviving placenames and historical evidence, indicates that the Picts spoke a Brythonic language, but none of their literature seems to have survived into the modern era. However, there is surviving literature from what would become Scotland in Brythonic, Gaelic, Latin and Old English.

Much of the earliest Welsh literature was actually composed in or near the country we now call Scotland, in the Brythonic speech, from which Welsh would be derived, which was not then confined to Wales and Cornwall, although it was only written down in Wales much later. These include &quot;The Gododdin&quot;, considered the earliest surviving verse from Scotland, which is attributed to the bard Aneirin, said to have been resident in Brythonic kingdom of Gododdin in the sixth century. It is a series of elegies to the men of the Gododdin killed fighting at the &quot;Battle of Catraeth&quot; around 600 AD. Similarly, the &quot;Battle of Gwen Ystrad&quot; is attributed to Taliesin, traditionally thought to be a bard at the court of Rheged in roughly the same period.

There are religious works in Gaelic including the &quot;Elegy for St Columba&quot; by Dallan Forgaill, c. 597 and &quot;In Praise of St Columba&quot; by Beccan mac Luigdech of Rum, c. 677. In Latin they include a &quot;Prayer for Protection&quot; (attributed to St Mugint), c. mid-sixth century and &quot;Altus Prosator&quot; (&quot;The High Creator&quot;, attributed to St Columba), c. 597. What is arguably the most important medieval work written in Scotland, the &quot;Vita Columbae&quot;, by Adomnán, abbot of Iona (627/8–704), was also written in Latin. The next most important piece of Scottish hagiography, the verse &quot;Life of St. Ninian&quot;, was written in Latin in Whithorn in the eighth century.

In Old English there is &quot;The Dream of the Rood&quot;, from which lines are found on the Ruthwell Cross, making it the only surviving fragment of Northumbrian Old English from early Medieval Scotland. It has also been suggested on the basis of ornithological references that the poem &quot;The Seafarer&quot; was composed somewhere near the Bass Rock in East Lothian. 

===High Middle Ages===
Beginning in the later eighth century, Viking raids and invasions may have forced a merger of the Gaelic and Pictish crowns that culminated in the rise of Cínaed mac Ailpín (Kenneth MacAlpin) in the 840s, which brought to power the House of Alpin and the creation of the Kingdom of Alba. Historical sources, as well as place name evidence, indicate the ways in which the Pictish language in the north and Cumbric languages in the south were overlaid and replaced by Gaelic, Old English and later Norse. The Kingdom of Alba was overwhelmingly an oral society dominated by Gaelic culture. Our fuller sources for Ireland of the same period suggest that there would have been filidh, who acted as poets, musicians and historians, often attached to the court of a lord or king, and passed on their knowledge and culture in Gaelic to the next generation.

From the eleventh century French, Flemish and particularly English became the main languages of Scottish burghs, most of which were located in the south and east. At least from the accession of David I (r. 1124–53), as part of a Davidian Revolution that introduced French culture and political systems, Gaelic ceased to be the main language of the royal court and was probably replaced by French. After this &quot;gallicisation&quot; of the Scottish court, a less highly regarded order of bards took over the functions of the filidh and they would continue to act in a similar role in the Highlands and Islands into the eighteenth century. They often trained in bardic schools, of which a few, like the one run by the MacMhuirich dynasty, who were bards to the Lord of the Isles, existed in Scotland and a larger number in Ireland, until they were suppressed from the seventeenth century. Members of bardic schools were trained in the complex rules and forms of Gaelic poetry. Much of their work was never written down and what survives was only recorded from the sixteenth century.

It is possible that more Middle Irish literature was written in medieval Scotland than is often thought, but has not survived because the Gaelic literary establishment of eastern Scotland died out before the fourteenth century. Thomas Owen Clancy has argued that the &quot;Lebor Bretnach&quot;, the so-called &quot;Irish Nennius&quot;, was written in Scotland, and probably at the monastery in Abernethy, but this text survives only from manuscripts preserved in Ireland. Other literary work that has survived includes that of the prolific poet Gille Brighde Albanach. About 1218, Gille Brighde wrote a poem—&quot;Heading for Damietta&quot;—on his experiences of the Fifth Crusade.

In the thirteenth century, French flourished as a literary language, and produced the &quot;Roman de Fergus&quot;, the earliest piece of non-Celtic vernacular literature to survive from Scotland. Many other stories in the Arthurian Cycle, written in French and preserved only outside Scotland, are thought by some scholars including D. D. R. Owen, to have been written in Scotland. There is some Norse literature from areas of Scandinavian settlement, such as the Northern Isles and the Western Isles. The famous &quot;Orkneyinga Saga&quot; however, although it pertains to the Earldom of Orkney, was written in Iceland. In addition to French, Latin too was a literary language, with works that include the &quot;Carmen de morte Sumerledi&quot;, a poem which exults triumphantly the victory of the citizens of Glasgow over Somairle mac Gilla Brigte and the &quot;Inchcolm Antiphoner&quot;, a hymn in praise of St. Columba.

===Late Middle Ages===
In the late Middle Ages, early Scots, often simply called English, became the dominant language of the country. It was derived largely from Old English, with the addition of elements from Gaelic and French. Although resembling the language spoken in northern England, it became a distinct dialect from the late fourteenth century onwards. It began to be adopted by the ruling elite as they gradually abandoned French. By the fifteenth century it was the language of government, with acts of parliament, council records and treasurer&#x27;s accounts almost all using it from the reign of James I onwards. As a result, Gaelic, once dominant north of the River Tay, began a steady decline. Lowland writers began to treat Gaelic as a second class, rustic and even amusing language, helping to frame attitudes towards the highlands and to create a cultural gulf with the lowlands.

The first surviving major text in Scots literature is John Barbour&#x27;s &quot;Brus&quot; (1375), composed under the patronage of Robert II and telling the story in epic poetry of Robert I&#x27;s actions before the English invasion until the end of the war of independence. The work was extremely popular among the Scots-speaking aristocracy and Barbour is referred to as the father of Scots poetry, holding a similar place to his contemporary Chaucer in England. In the early fifteenth century these were followed by Andrew of Wyntoun&#x27;s verse &quot;Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland&quot; and Blind Harry&#x27;s &quot;The Wallace&quot;, which blended historical romance with the verse chronicle. They were probably influenced by Scots versions of popular French romances that were also produced in the period, including &quot;The Buik of Alexander&quot;, &quot;Launcelot o the Laik&quot; and &quot;The Porteous of Noblenes&quot; by Gilbert Hay.

Much Middle Scots literature was produced by makars, poets with links to the royal court, which included James I (who wrote &quot;The Kingis Quair&quot;). Many of the makars had university education and so were also connected with the Kirk. However, Dunbar&#x27;s &quot;Lament for the Makaris&quot; (c.1505) provides evidence of a wider tradition of secular writing outside of Court and Kirk now largely lost. Before the advent of printing in Scotland, writers such as Robert Henryson, William Dunbar, Walter Kennedy and Gavin Douglas have been seen as leading a golden age in Scottish poetry.

In the late fifteenth century, Scots prose also began to develop as a genre. Although there are earlier fragments of original Scots prose, such as the &quot;Auchinleck Chronicle&quot;, the first complete surviving work includes John Ireland&#x27;s &quot;The Meroure of Wyssdome&quot; (1490). There were also prose translations of French books of chivalry that survive from the 1450s, including &quot;The Book of the Law of Armys&quot; and the &quot;Order of Knychthode&quot; and the treatise &quot;Secreta Secretorum&quot;, an Arabic work believed to be Aristotle&#x27;s advice to Alexander the Great. The establishment of a printing press under royal patent in 1507 would begin to make it easier to disseminate Scottish literature and was probably aimed at bolstering Scottish national identity. The first Scottish press was established in Southgait in Edinburgh by the merchant Walter Chepman (c. 1473–c. 1528) and the bookseller Andrew Myllar (f. 1505–08). Although the first press was relatively short lived, beside law codes and religious works, the press also produced editions of the work of Scottish makars before its demise, probably about 1510. The next recorded press was that of Thomas Davidson (f. 1532–42), the first in a long line of &quot;king&#x27;s printers&quot;, who also produced editions of works of the makars. The landmark work in the reign of James IV was Gavin Douglas&#x27;s version of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, the &quot;Eneados&quot;, which was the first complete translation of a major classical text in the Scots language and the first successful example of its kind in any Anglic language. It was finished in 1513, but overshadowed by the disaster at Flodden.

==Early modern era==

===Sixteenth century===

As a patron of poets and authors James V (r. 1513–42) supported William Stewart and John Bellenden, who translated the Latin &quot;History of Scotland&quot; compiled in 1527 by Hector Boece, into verse and prose. David Lyndsay (c. 1486–1555), diplomat and the head of the Lyon Court, was a prolific poet. He wrote elegiac narratives, romances and satires. George Buchanan (1506–82) had a major influence as a Latin poet, founding a tradition of neo-Latin poetry that would continue in to the seventeenth century. Contributors to this tradition included royal secretary John Maitland (1537–95), reformer Andrew Melville (1545–1622), John Johnston (1570?–1611) and David Hume of Godscroft (1558–1629).

From the 1550s, in the reign of Mary, Queen of Scots (r. 1542–67) and the minority of her son James VI (r. 1567–1625), cultural pursuits were limited by the lack of a royal court and by political turmoil. The Kirk, heavily influenced by Calvinism, also discouraged poetry that was not devotional in nature. Nevertheless, poets from this period included Richard Maitland of Lethington (1496–1586), who produced meditative and satirical verses in the style of Dunbar; John Rolland (fl. 1530–75), who wrote allegorical satires in the tradition of Douglas and courtier and minister Alexander Hume (c. 1556–1609), whose corpus of work includes nature poetry and epistolary verse. Alexander Scott&#x27;s (?1520–82/3) use of short verse designed to be sung to music, opened the way for the Castilan poets of James VI&#x27;s adult reign.

In the 1580s and 1590s James VI strongly promoted the literature of the country of his birth in Scots. His treatise, &quot;Some Rules and Cautions to be Observed and Eschewed in Scottish Prosody&quot;, published in 1584 when he was aged 18, was both a poetic manual and a description of the poetic tradition in his mother tongue, to which he applied Renaissance principles. He became patron and member of a loose circle of Scottish Jacobean court poets and musicians, later called the Castalian Band, which included William Fowler (c. 1560–1612), John Stewart of Baldynneis (c. 1545–c. 1605), and Alexander Montgomerie (c. 1550–98). They translated key Renaissance texts and produced poems using French forms, including sonnets and short sonnets, for narrative, nature description, satire and meditations on love. Later poets that followed in this vein included William Alexander (c. 1567–1640), Alexander Craig (c. 1567–1627) and Robert Ayton (1570–1627). By the late 1590s the king&#x27;s championing of his native Scottish tradition was to some extent diffused by the prospect of inheriting of the English throne.

Lyndsay produced an interlude at Linlithgow Palace for the king and queen thought to be a version of his play &quot;The Thrie Estaitis&quot; in 1540, which satirised the corruption of church and state, and which is the only complete play to survive from before the Reformation. Buchanan was major influence on Continental theatre with plays such as &quot;Jepheths&quot; and &quot;Baptistes&quot;, which influenced Pierre Corneille and Jean Racine and through them the neo-classical tradition in French drama, but his impact in Scotland was limited by his choice of Latin as a medium. The anonymous &quot;The Maner of the Cyring of ane Play&quot; (before 1568) and &quot;Philotus&quot; (published in London in 1603), are isolated examples of surviving plays. The latter is a vernacular Scots comedy of errors, probably designed for court performance for Mary, Queen of Scots or James VI. The same system of professional companies of players and theatres that developed in England in this period was absent in Scotland, but James VI signalled his interest in drama by arranging for a company of English players to erect a playhouse and perform in 1599.

===Seventeenth century===

Having extolled the virtues of Scots &quot;poesie&quot;, following his accession to the English throne, James VI increasingly favoured the language of southern England. In 1611 the Kirk adopted the English Authorised King James Version of the Bible. In 1617 interpreters were declared no longer necessary in the port of London because Scots and Englishmen were now &quot;not so far different bot ane understandeth ane uther&quot;. Jenny Wormald, describes James as creating a &quot;three-tier system, with Gaelic at the bottom and English at the top&quot;. The loss of the court as a centre of patronage in 1603 was a major blow to Scottish literature. A number of Scottish poets, including William Alexander, John Murray and Robert Aytoun accompanied the king to London, where they continued to write, but they soon began to anglicise their written language. James&#x27;s characteristic role as active literary participant and patron in the English court made him a defining figure for English Renaissance poetry and drama, which would reach a pinnacle of achievement in his reign, but his patronage for the high style in his own Scottish tradition largely became sidelined. The only significant court poet to continue to work in Scotland after the king&#x27;s departure was William Drummond of Hawthornden (1585–1649).

As the tradition of classical Gaelic poetry declined, a new tradition of vernacular Gaelic poetry began to emerge. While Classical poetry used a language largely fixed in the twelfth century, the vernacular continued to develop. In contrast to the Classical tradition, which used syllabic metre, vernacular poets tended to use stressed metre. However, they shared with the Classic poets a set of complex metaphors and role, as the verse was still often panegyric. A number of these vernacular poets were women, such as Mary MacLeod of Harris (c. 1615–1707).

The tradition of neo-Latin poetry reached its fruition with the publication of the anthology of the &quot;Deliciae Poetarum Scotorum&quot; (1637), published in Amsterdam by Arthur Johnston (c. 1579–1641) and Sir John Scott of Scotstarvet (1585–1670) and containing work by the major Scottish practitioners since Buchanan. This period was marked by the work of the first named female Scottish poets. Elizabeth Melville&#x27;s (f. 1585–1630) &quot;Ane Godlie Dream&quot; (1603) was a popular religious allegory and the first book published by a woman in Scotland. Anna Hume, daughter of David Hume of Godscroft, adapted Petrarch&#x27;s &quot;Triumphs&quot; as &quot;Triumphs of Love: Chastitie: Death&quot; (1644).

This was the period when the ballad emerged as a significant written form in Scotland. Some ballads may date back to the late medieval era and deal with events and people that can be traced back as far as the thirteenth century, including &quot;Sir Patrick Spens&quot; and &quot;Thomas the Rhymer&quot;, but which are not known to have existed until the eighteenth century. They were probably composed and transmitted orally and only began to be written down and printed, often as broadsides and as part of chapbooks, later being recorded and noted in books by collectors including Robert Burns and Walter Scott. From the seventeenth century they were used as a literary form by aristocratic authors including Robert Sempill (c. 1595–c. 1665), Lady Elizabeth Wardlaw (1627–1727) and Lady Grizel Baillie (1645–1746).

The loss of a royal court also meant there was no force to counter the kirk&#x27;s dislike of theatre, which struggled to survive in Scotland. However, it was not entirely extinguished. The kirk used theatre for its own purposes in schools and was slow to suppress popular folk dramas. Surviving plays for the period include William Alexander&#x27;s &quot;Monarchicke Tragedies&quot;, written just before his departure with the king for England in 1603. They were closet dramas, designed to be read rather than performed, and already indicate Alexander&#x27;s preference for southern English over the Scots language. There were some attempts to revive Scottish drama. In 1663 Edinburgh lawyer William Clerke wrote &quot;Marciano or the Discovery&quot;, a play about the restoration of a legitimate dynasty in Florence after many years of civil war. It was performed at the Tennis-Court Theatre at Holyrood Palace before the parliamentary high commissioner John Leslie, Earl of Rothes. Thomas Sydsurf&#x27;s &quot;Tarugo&#x27;s Wiles or the Coffee House&quot;, was first performed in London in 1667 and then in Edinburgh the year after and drew on Spanish comedy. A relative of Sydsurf, physician Archibald Pitcairne (1652–1713) wrote &quot;The Assembly or Scotch Reformation&quot; (1692), a ribald satire on the morals of the Presbyterian kirk, circulating in manuscript, but not published until 1722, helping to secure the association between Jacobitism and professional drama that discouraged the creation of professional theatre.

==Eighteenth century==

After the Union in 1707 and the shift of political power to England, the use of Scots was discouraged by many in authority and education. Nevertheless, Scots remained the vernacular of many rural communities and the growing number of urban working-class Scots. Literature developed a distinct national identity and began to enjoy an international reputation. Allan Ramsay (1686–1758) was the most important literary figure of the era, often described as leading a &quot;vernacular revival&quot;. He laid the foundations of a reawakening of interest in older Scottish literature, publishing &quot;The Ever Green&quot; (1724), a collection that included many major poetic works of the Stewart period. He led the trend for pastoral poetry, helping to develop the Habbie stanza, which would be later be used by Robert Burns as a poetic form. His &quot;Tea-Table Miscellany&quot; (1724–37) contained poems old Scots folk material, his own poems in the folk style and &quot;gentilizings&quot; of Scots poems in the English neo-classical style. His pastoral opera &quot;The Gentle Shepherd&quot; was one of the most influential works of the era. He would also play a leading role in supporting drama in Scotland and the attempt to found a permanent theatre in the capital.

Ramsay was part of a community of poets working in Scots and English. These included William Hamilton of Gilbertfield (c. 1665–1751), Robert Crawford (1695–1733), Alexander Ross (1699–1784), the Jacobite William Hamilton of Bangour (1704–54), socialite Alison Rutherford Cockburn (1712–94), and poet and playwright James Thomson&#x27;s (1700–48), most famous for the nature poetry of his &quot;Seasons&quot;. Tobias Smollett (1721–71) was a poet, essayist, satirist and playwright, but is best known for his picaresque novels, such as &quot;The Adventures of Roderick Random&quot; (1748) and &quot;The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle&quot; (1751) for which he is often seen as Scotland&#x27;s first novelist. His work would be a major influence on later novelists such as Thackeray and Dickens.

The early eighteenth century was also a period of innovation in Gaelic vernacular poetry. Major figures included Rob Donn Mackay (1714–78) and Donnchadh Bàn Mac an t-Saoir (Duncan Ban MacIntyre) (1724–1812). The most significant figure in the tradition was Alasdair mac Mhaighstir Alasdair (Alasdair MacDonald) (c. 1698–1770). His interest in traditional forms can be seen in his most significant poem &quot;Clanranald&#x27;s Gallery&quot;. He also mixed these traditions with influences from the Lowlands, including Thompson&#x27;s &quot;Seasons&quot;, which helped inspire a new form of nature poetry in Gaelic, which was not focused on their relations to human concerns.
James Macpherson was the first Scottish poet to gain an international reputation, claiming to have found poetry written by Ossian, he published translations that acquired international popularity, being proclaimed as a Celtic equivalent of the Classical epics. &quot;Fingal&quot; written in 1762 was speedily translated into many European languages, and its deep appreciation of natural beauty and the melancholy tenderness of its treatment of the ancient legend did more than any single work to bring about the Romantic movement in European, and especially in German, literature, influencing Herder and Goethe. Eventually it became clear that the poems were not direct translations from the Gaelic, but flowery adaptations made to suit the aesthetic expectations of his audience.

Robert Burns was highly influenced by the Ossian cycle. Burns, an Ayrshire poet and lyricist, is widely regarded as the national poet of Scotland and a major figure in the Romantic movement. As well as making original compositions, Burns also collected folk songs from across Scotland, often revising or adapting them. His poem (and song) &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; is often sung at Hogmanay (the last day of the year), and &quot;Scots Wha Hae&quot; served for a long time as an unofficial national anthem of the country. Burns&#x27;s poetry drew upon a substantial familiarity with and knowledge of Classical, Biblical, and English literature, as well as the Scottish Makar tradition. Burns was skilled in writing not only in the Scots language but also in the Scottish English dialect of the English language. Some of his works, such as &quot;Love and Liberty&quot; (also known as &quot;The Jolly Beggars&quot;), are written in both Scots and English for various effects. His themes included republicanism, Radicalism, Scottish patriotism, anticlericalism, class inequalities, gender roles, commentary on the Scottish Kirk of his time, Scottish cultural identity, poverty, sexuality, and the beneficial aspects of popular socialising. Other major literary figures connected with Romanticism include the poets and novelists James Hogg (1770–1835), Allan Cunningham (1784–1842) and John Galt (1779–1839),
Drama was pursued by Scottish playwrights in London such as Catherine Trotter (1679–1749), born in London to Scottish parents and later moving to Aberdeen. Her plays and included the verse-tragedy &quot;Fatal Friendship&quot; (1698), the comedy &quot;Love at a Loss&quot; (1700) and the history &quot;The Revolution in Sweden&quot; (1706). David Crawford&#x27;s (1665–1726) plays included the Restoration comedies &quot;Courtship A-la-Mode&quot; (1700) and &quot;Love at First Sight&quot; (1704). These developed the character of the stage Scot, often a clown, but cunning and loyal. Newburgh Hamilton (1691–1761), born in Ireland of Scottish descent, produced the comedies &quot;The Petticoat-Ploter&quot; (1712) and &quot;The Doating Lovers&quot; or &quot;The Libertine&quot; (1715). He later wrote the libretto for Handel&#x27;s &quot;Samson&quot; (1743), closely based on John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Samson Agonistes&quot;. James Thomson&#x27;s plays often dealt with the contest between public duty and private feelings, included &quot;Sophonisba&quot; (1730), &quot;Agamemnon&quot; (1738) and &quot;Tancrid and Sigismuda&quot; (1745), the last of which was an international success. David Mallet&#x27;s (c. 1705–65) &quot;Eurydice&quot; (1731) was accused of being a coded Jacobite play and his later work indicates opposition to the Walpole administration. The opera &quot;Masque of Alfred&quot; (1740) was a collaboration between Thompson, Mallet and composer Thomas Arne, with Thompson supplying the lyrics for his most famous work, the patriotic song &quot;Rule, Britannia!&quot;.

In Scotland performances were largely limited to performances by visiting actors, who faced hostility from the Kirk. The Edinburgh Company of Players were able to perform in Dundee, Montrose, Aberdeen and regular performances at the Taylor&#x27;s Hall in Edinburgh under the protection of a Royal Patent. Ramsay was instrumental in establishing them in a small theatre in Carruber&#x27;s Close in Edinburgh, but the passing of the 1737 Licensing Act made their activities illegal and the theatre soon closed. A new theatre was opened at Cannongate in 1747 and operated without a licence into the 1760s. In the later eighteenth century, many plays were written for and performed by small amateur companies and were not published and so most have been lost. Towards the end of the century there were &quot;closet dramas&quot;, primarily designed to be read, rather than performed, including work by Hogg, Galt and Joanna Baillie (1762–1851), often influenced by the ballad tradition and Gothic Romanticism.

==Nineteenth century==
Scottish poetry is often seen as entering a period of decline in the nineteenth century, with a descent of into infantalism as exemplified by the highly popular Whistle Binkie anthologies (1830–90). However, Scotland continued to produce talented and successful poets, including weaver-poet William Thom (1799–1848), Lady Margaret Maclean Clephane Compton Northampton (d. 1830), William Edmondstoune Aytoun (1813–65) and Thomas Campbell (1777–1844), whose works were extensively reprinted in the period 1800–60. Among the most influential poets of the later nineteenth century were James Thomson (1834–82) and John Davidson (1857–1909), whose work would have a major impact on modernist poets including Hugh MacDiarmid, Wallace Stevens and T. S. Eliot. The Highland Clearances and widespread emigration significantly weakened Gaelic language and culture and had a profound impact on the nature of Gaelic poetry. The best poetry in this vein contained a strong element of protest, including Uilleam Mac Dhun Lèibhe&#x27;s (William Livingstone, 1808–70) protest against the Islay and Seonaidh Phàdraig Iarsiadair&#x27;s (John Smith, 1848–81) condemnation of those responsible for the clearances. The best known Gaelic poet of the era was Màiri Mhòr nan Óran (Mary MacPherson, 1821–98), whose evocation of place and mood has made her among the most enduring Gaelic poets.

Walter Scott began as a poet and also collected and published Scottish ballads. His first prose work, &quot;Waverley&quot; in 1814, is often called the first historical novel. It launched a highly successful career, with other historical novels such as &quot;Rob Roy&quot; (1817), &quot;The Heart of Midlothian&quot; (1818) and &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; (1820). Scott probably did more than any other figure to define and popularise Scottish cultural identity in the nineteenth century.

Scottish &quot;national drama&quot; emerged in the early 1800s, as plays with specifically Scottish themes began to dominate the Scottish stage.
The existing repertoire of Scottish-themed plays included John Home&#x27;s &quot;Douglas&quot; (1756) and Ramsay&#x27;s &quot;The Gentle Shepherd&quot; (1725), with the last two being the most popular plays among amateur groups. Scott was keenly interested in drama, becoming a shareholder in the Theatre Royal, Edinburgh. Baillie&#x27;s Highland themed &quot;The Family Legend&quot; was first produced in Edinburgh in 1810 with the help of Scott, as part of a deliberate attempt to stimulate a national Scottish drama. Scott also wrote five plays, of which &quot;Hallidon Hill&quot; (1822) and &quot;MacDuff&#x27;s Cross&quot; (1822), were patriotic Scottish histories. Adaptations of the Waverley novels, largely first performed in minor theatres, rather than the larger Patent theatres, included &quot;The Lady in the Lake&quot; (1817), &quot;The Heart of Midlothian&quot; (1819), and &quot;Rob Roy&quot;, which underwent over 1,000 performances in Scotland in this period. Also adapted for the stage were &quot;Guy Mannering&quot;, &quot;The Bride of Lammermoor&quot; and &quot;The Abbot&quot;. These highly popular plays saw the social range and size of the audience for theatre expand and helped shape theatre-going practices in Scotland for the rest of the century.

Scotland was also the location of two of the most important literary magazines of the era, &quot;The Edinburgh Review&quot;, founded in 1802 and &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, founded in 1817. Together they had a major impact on the development of British literature and drama in the era of Romanticism.

Thomas Carlyle, in such works as &quot;Sartor Resartus&quot; (1833–34), &quot;The French Revolution: A History&quot; (1837) and &quot;On Heroes, Hero-Worship, &amp; the Heroic in History&quot; (1841), profoundly influenced philosophy and literature of the age.

In the late 19th century, a number of Scottish-born authors achieved international reputations. Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s work included the urban Gothic novella &quot;Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot; (1886), and played a major part in developing the historical adventure in books like &quot;Kidnapped&quot; and &quot;Treasure Island&quot;. Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; stories helped found the tradition of detective fiction. The &quot;kailyard tradition&quot; at the end of the century, brought elements of fantasy and folklore back into fashion as can be seen in the work of figures like J. M. Barrie, most famous for his creation of Peter Pan and George MacDonald whose works including &quot;Phantastes&quot; played a major part in the creation of the fantasy genre.

==Twentieth century to the present==


In the early twentieth century there was a new surge of activity in Scottish literature, influenced by modernism and resurgent nationalism, known as the Scottish Renaissance. The leading figure in the movement was Hugh MacDiarmid (the pseudonym of Christopher Murray Grieve). MacDiarmid attempted to revive the Scots language as a medium for serious literature in poetic works including &quot;A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle&quot; (1936), developing a form of Synthetic Scots that combined different regional dialects and archaic terms. Other writers that emerged in this period, and are often treated as part of the movement, include the poets Edwin Muir and William Soutar, the novelists Neil Gunn, George Blake, Nan Shepherd, A. J. Cronin, Naomi Mitchison, Eric Linklater and Lewis Grassic Gibbon, and the playwright James Bridie. All were born within a fifteen-year period (1887–1901) and, although they cannot be described as members of a single school they all pursued an exploration of identity, rejecting nostalgia and parochialism and engaging with social and political issues. This period saw the emergence of a tradition of popular or working class theatre. Hundreds of amateur groups were established, particularly in the growing urban centres of the Lowlands. Amateur companies encouraged native playwrights, including Robert McLellan.

Some writers that emerged after the Second World War followed MacDiarmid by writing in Scots, including Robert Garioch and Sydney Goodsir Smith. Others demonstrated a greater interest in English language poetry, among them Norman MacCaig, George Bruce and Maurice Lindsay. George Mackay Brown from Orkney, and Iain Crichton Smith from Lewis, wrote both poetry and prose fiction shaped by their distinctive island backgrounds. The Glaswegian poet Edwin Morgan became known for translations of works from a wide range of European languages. He was also the first Scots Makar (the official national poet), appointed by the inaugural Scottish government in 2004. The shift to drama that focused on working class life in the post-war period gained momentum with Robert McLeish&#x27;s &quot;The Gorbals Story&quot; and the work of Ena Lamont Stewart, Robert Kemp and George Munro. Many major Scottish post-war novelists, such as Muriel Spark, James Kennaway, Alexander Trocchi, Jessie Kesson and Robin Jenkins spent much or most of their lives outside Scotland, but often dealt with Scottish themes, as in Spark&#x27;s Edinburgh-set &quot;The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie&quot; (1961) and Kennaway&#x27;s script for the film &quot;Tunes of Glory&quot; (1956). Successful mass-market works included the action novels of Alistair MacLean, and the historical fiction of Dorothy Dunnett. A younger generation of novelists that emerged in the 1960s and 1970s included Shena Mackay, Alan Spence, Allan Massie and the work of William McIlvanney.
From the 1980s Scottish literature enjoyed another major revival, particularly associated with a group of Glasgow writers focused around meetings in the house of critic, poet and teacher Philip Hobsbaum. Also important in the movement was Peter Kravitz, editor of Polygon Books. Members of the group that would come to prominence as writers included James Kelman, Alasdair Gray, Liz Lochhead, Tom Leonard and Aonghas MacNeacail. In the 1990s major, prize winning, Scottish novels that emerged from this movement included Irvine Welsh&#x27;s &quot;Trainspotting&quot; (1993), Warner&#x27;s &quot;Morvern Callar&quot; (1995), Gray&#x27;s &quot;Poor Things&quot; (1992) and Kelman&#x27;s &quot;How Late It Was, How Late&quot; (1994). These works were linked by a sometimes overtly political reaction to Thatcherism that explored marginal areas of experience and used vivid vernacular language (including expletives and Scots). Gray and Iain Banks led a wave of fantasy, speculative and science-fiction writing with notable authors including Ken MacLeod, Andrew Crumey, Michel Faber, Alice Thompson and Frank Kuppner. Scottish crime fiction has been a major area of growth with the success of novelists including Val McDermid, Frederic Lindsay, Christopher Brookmyre, Quintin Jardine, Denise Mina and particularly the success of Edinburgh&#x27;s Ian Rankin and his Inspector Rebus novels. Scottish play writing became increasingly internationalised, with Scottish writers such as Liz Lochhead and Edwin Morgan adapting classic texts, while Jo Clifford and David Greig investigated European themes. This period also saw the emergence of a new generation of Scottish poets that became leading figures on the UK stage, including Don Paterson, Kathleen Jamie, Douglas Dunn, Robert Crawford, and Carol Ann Duffy. Glasgow-born Duffy was named as Poet Laureate in May 2009, the first woman, the first Scot and the first openly gay poet to take the post.

<doc id="236287" wikidata="Q3349126" url="?curid=236287" title="Ode to a Nightingale">
<text>&quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot; is a poem by John Keats written either in the garden of the Spaniards Inn, Hampstead, London or, according to Keats&#x27; friend Charles Armitage Brown, under a plum tree in the garden of Keats&#x27; house at Wentworth Place, also in Hampstead. According to Brown, a nightingale had built its nest near the house that he shared with Keats in the spring of 1819. Inspired by the bird&#x27;s song, Keats composed the poem in one day. It soon became one of his 1819 odes and was first published in &quot;Annals of the Fine Arts&quot; the following July. The poem is one of the most frequently anthologized in the English language.

&quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot; is a personal poem which describes Keats&#x27; journey into the state of negative capability. The tone of the poem rejects the optimistic pursuit of pleasure found within Keats&#x27;s earlier poems and, instead, explores the themes of nature, and mortality, the latter being particularly relevant to Keats.

The nightingale described experiences a type of death but does not actually die. Instead, the songbird is capable of living through its song, which is a fate that humans cannot expect. The poem ends with an acceptance that pleasure cannot last and that death is an inevitable part of life. In the poem, Keats imagines the loss of the physical world and sees himself dead—as a &quot;sod&quot; over which the nightingale sings. The contrast between the immortal nightingale and mortal man sitting in his garden, is made all the more acute by an effort of the imagination. The presence of weather is noticeable in the poem, as spring came early in 1819, bringing nightingales all over the heath.

==Background==

Of Keats&#x27;s six major odes of 1819, &quot;Ode to Psyche&quot;, was probably written first and &quot;To Autumn&quot; written last. Some time between these two, he wrote &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot;. It is possible that &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot; was written between 26 April and 18 May 1819, based on weather conditions and similarities between images in the poem and those in a letter sent to Fanny Brawne on May Day. The poem was composed at the Hampstead house Keats shared with Brown, possibly while sitting beneath a plum tree in the garden. According to Keats&#x27; friend Brown, Keats finished the ode in just one morning: &quot;In the spring of 1819 a nightingale had built her nest near my house. Keats felt a tranquil and continual joy in her song; and one morning he took his chair from the breakfast-table to the grass-plot under a plum-tree, where he sat for two or three hours. When he came into the house, I perceived he had some scraps of paper in his hand, and these he was quietly thrusting behind the books. On inquiry, I found those scraps, four or five in number, contained his poetic feelings on the song of the nightingale.&quot; Brown&#x27;s account is personal, as he claimed the poem was directly influenced by his house and preserved by his own doing. However, Keats relied on both his own imagination and other literature as sources for his depiction of the nightingale.

The exact date of &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot;, as well as those of &quot;Ode on Indolence&quot;, &quot;Ode on Melancholy&quot;, and &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot;, is unknown, as Keats dated all as &#x27;May 1819&#x27;. However, he worked on the four poems together, and there is a unity in both their stanza forms and their themes. The exact order in which the poems were written is also unknown, but they form a sequence within their structures. While Keats was writing &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot; and the other poems, Brown transcribed copies of the poems and submitted them to Richard Woodhouse. During this time, Benjamin Haydon, Keats&#x27; friend, was given a copy of &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot;, and he shared the poem with the editor of the &quot;Annals of the Fine Arts&quot;, James Elmes. Elmes paid Keats a small sum of money, and the poem was published in the July issue. The poem was later included in Keats&#x27; 1820 collection of poems &quot;Lamia, Isabella, The Eve of St Agnes, and Other Poems&quot;.

==Structure==
&quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot; was probably the first of the middle set of four odes that Keats wrote following &quot;Ode to Psyche&quot;, according to Brown. This is further evidenced by the poems&#x27; structures. Keats experimentally combines two different types of lyrical poetry: the odal hymn and the lyric of questioning voice that responds to the odal hymn. This combination of structures is similar to that in &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot;. In both poems, the dual form creates a dramatic element within the text. The stanza form of the poem is a combination of elements from Petrarchan sonnets and Shakespearean sonnets.

Keats incorporates a pattern of alternating historically &quot;short&quot; and &quot;long&quot; vowel sounds in his ode. In particular, line 18 (&quot;And purple-stained mouth&quot;) has the historical pattern of &quot;short&quot; followed by &quot;long&quot; followed by &quot;short&quot; and followed by &quot;long&quot;. This alternation is continued in longer lines, including line 31 (&quot;Away! away! for I will fly to thee&quot;) which contains five pairs of alternations. However, other lines, such as line 3 (&quot;Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains&quot;) rely on a pattern of five &quot;short&quot; vowels followed by &quot;long&quot; and &quot;short&quot; vowel pairings until they end with a &quot;long&quot; vowel. These are not the only combination patterns present, and there are patterns of two &quot;short&quot; vowels followed by a &quot;long&quot; vowel in other lines, including 12, 22, and 59, which are repeated twice and then followed up with two sets of &quot;short&quot; and then &quot;long&quot; vowel pairs. This reliance on vowel sounds is not unique to this ode, but is common to Keats&#x27;s other 1819 odes and his &quot;Eve of St. Agnes&quot;.

The poem incorporates a complex reliance on assonance—the repetition of vowel sounds—in a conscious pattern, as found in many of his poems. Such a reliance on assonance is found in very few English poems. Within &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot;, an example of this pattern can be found in line 35 (&quot;Already with thee! tender is the night&quot;), where the &quot;ea&quot; of &quot;Already&quot; connects with the &quot;e&quot; of &quot;tender&quot; and the &quot;i&quot; of &quot;with&quot; connects with the &quot;i&quot; of &quot;is&quot;. This same pattern is found again in line 41 (&quot;I cannot see what flowers are at my feet&quot;) with the &quot;a&quot; of &quot;cannot&quot; linking with the &quot;a&quot; of &quot;at&quot; and the &quot;ee&quot; of &quot;see&quot; linking with the &quot;ee&quot; of &quot;feet&quot;. This system of assonance can be found in approximately a tenth of the lines of Keats&#x27;s later poetry.

When it comes to other sound patterns, Keats relies on double or triple caesuras in approximately 6% of lines throughout the 1819 odes. An example from &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot; can be found within line 45 (&quot;The grass, the thicket, and the fruit-tree wild&quot;) as the pauses after the commas are a &quot;masculine&quot; pause. Furthermore, Keats began to reduce the amount of Latin-based words and syntax that he relied on in his poetry, which in turn shortened the length of the words that dominate the poem. There is also an emphasis on words beginning with consonants, especially those that begin with &quot;b&quot;, &quot;p&quot; or &quot;v&quot;. The first stanza relies heavily on these three consonants, and they are used as a syzygy to add a musical tone within the poem.

Compared to his earlier verse, spondees are relatively abundant in his 1819 odes and other late poems. In &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot; they are used in just over 8% of his lines (compared to a mere 2.6% in &quot;Endymion&quot;). Examples include:
 Cool&#x27;d a long age in the deep-delvèd earth (line 12)
 × / × / × / / / / /
 Where palsy shakes a few, sad, last, grey hairs (line 25)

To Walter Jackson Bate, the use of spondees in lines 31–34 creates a feeling of slow flight, and &quot;in the final stanza . . . the distinctive use of scattered spondees, together with initial inversion, lend[s] an approximate phonetic suggestion of the peculiar spring and bounce of the bird in its flight.&quot;

==Poem==

The first and sixth stanzas exemplify the juxtaposition of rapture and morbidity in the poem:
==Themes==
&quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot; describes a series of conflicts between reality and the Romantic ideal of uniting with nature. In the words of Richard Fogle, &quot;The principal stress of the poem is a struggle between ideal and actual: inclusive terms which, however, contain more particular antitheses of pleasure and pain, of imagination and common sense reason, of fullness and privation, of permanence and change, of nature and the human, of art and life, freedom and bondage, waking and dream.&quot; Of course, the nightingale&#x27;s song is the dominant image and dominant &quot;voice&quot; within the ode. The nightingale is also the object of empathy and praise within the poem. However, the nightingale and the discussion of the nightingale is not simply about the bird or the song, but about human experience in general. This is not to say that the song is a simple metaphor, but it is a complex image that is formed through the interaction of the conflicting voices of praise and questioning. On this theme, David Perkins summarizes the way &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot; and &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot; perform this when he says, &quot;we are dealing with a talent, indeed an entire approach to poetry, in which symbol, however necessary, may possibly not satisfy as the principal concern of poetry, any more than it could with Shakespeare, but is rather an element in the poetry and drama of human reactions&quot;. However, there is a difference between an urn and a nightingale in that the nightingale is not an eternal entity. Furthermore, in creating any aspect of the nightingale immortal during the poem the narrator separates any union that he can have with the nightingale.

The nightingale&#x27;s song within the poem is connected to the art of music in a way that the urn in &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot; is connected to the art of sculpture. As such, the nightingale would represent an enchanting presence and, unlike the urn, is directly connected to nature. As natural music, the song is for beauty and lacks a message of truth. Keats follows Coleridge&#x27;s belief, as found in &quot;The Nightingale&quot;, in separating from the world by losing himself in the bird&#x27;s song. Although Keats favours a female nightingale over Coleridge&#x27;s masculine bird, both reject the traditional depiction of the nightingale as related to the tragedy of Philomela. Their songbird is a happy nightingale that lacks the melancholic feel of previous poetic depictions. The bird is only a voice within the poem, but it is a voice that compels the narrator to join with in and forget the sorrows of the world. However, there is tension in that the narrator holds Keats&#x27;s guilt regarding the death of Tom Keats, his brother. The song&#x27;s conclusion represents the result of trying to escape into the realm of fancy.

Like Percy Bysshe Shelley&#x27;s &quot;To a Skylark&quot;, Keats&#x27;s narrator listens to a bird song, but listening to the song within &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot; is almost painful and similar to death. The narrator seeks to be with the nightingale and abandons his sense of vision in order to embrace the sound in an attempt to share in the darkness with the bird. As the poem ends, the trance caused by the nightingale is broken and the narrator is left wondering if it was a real vision or just a dream. The poem&#x27;s reliance on the process of sleeping is common to Keats&#x27;s poems, and &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot; shares many of the same themes as Keats&#x27; &quot;Sleep and Poetry&quot; and &quot;Eve of St. Agnes&quot;. This further separates the image of the nightingale&#x27;s song from its closest comparative image, the urn as represented in &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot;. The nightingale is distant and mysterious, and even disappears at the end of the poem. The dream image emphasizes the shadowiness and elusiveness of the poem. These elements make it impossible for there to be a complete self-identification with the nightingale, but it also allows for self-awareness to permeate throughout the poem, albeit in an altered state.

Midway through the poem, there is a split between the two actions of the poem: the first attempts to identify with the nightingale and its song, and the second discusses the convergence of the past with the future while experiencing the present. This second theme is reminiscent of Keats&#x27;s view of human progression through the Mansion of Many Apartments and how man develops from experiencing and wanting only pleasure to understanding truth as a mixture of both pleasure and pain. The Elysian fields and the nightingale&#x27;s song in the first half of the poem represent the pleasurable moments that overwhelm the individual like a drug. However, the experience does not last forever, and the body is left desiring it until the narrator feels helpless without the pleasure. Instead of embracing the coming truth, the narrator clings to poetry to hide from the loss of pleasure. Poetry does not bring about the pleasure that the narrator originally asks for, but it does liberate him from his desire for only pleasure.

Responding to this emphasis on pleasure, Albert Guerard, Jr. argues that the poem contains a &quot;longing not for art but a free reverie of any kind. The form of the poem is that of progression by association, so that the movement of feeling is at the mercy of words evoked by chance, such words as &quot;fade&quot; and &quot;forlorn&quot;, the very words that, like a bell, toll the dreamer back to his sole self.&quot; However, Fogle points out that the terms Guerard emphasizes are &quot;associational translations&quot; and that Guerard misunderstands Keats&#x27;s aesthetic. After all, the acceptance of the loss of pleasure by the end of the poem is an acceptance of life and, in turn, of death. Death was a constant theme that permeated aspects of Keats poetry because he was exposed to death of his family members throughout his life. Within the poem, there are many images of death. The nightingale experiences a sort of death and even the god Apollo experiences death, but his death reveals his own divine state. As Perkins explains, &quot;But, of course, the nightingale is not thought to be literally dying. The point is that the deity or the nightingale can sing without dying. But, as the ode makes clear, man cannot—or at least not in a visionary way.&quot;

With this theme of a loss of pleasure and inevitable death, the poem, according to Claude Finney, describes &quot;the inadequacy of the romantic escape from the world of reality to the world of ideal beauty&quot;. Earl Wasserman essentially agrees with Finney, but he extended his summation of the poem to incorporate the themes of Keats&#x27;s Mansion of Many Apartments when he says, &quot;the core of the poem is the search for the mystery, the unsuccessful quest for light within its darkness&quot; and this &quot;leads only to an increasing darkness, or a growing recognition of how impenetrable the mystery is to mortals.&quot; With these views in mind, the poem recalls Keats&#x27;s earlier view of pleasure and an optimistic view of poetry found within his earlier poems, especially &quot;Sleep and Poetry&quot;, and rejects them. This loss of pleasure and incorporation of death imagery lends the poem a dark air, which connects &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot; with Keats&#x27; other poems that discuss the demonic nature of poetic imagination, including &quot;Lamia&quot;. In the poem, Keats imagines the loss of the physical world and sees himself dead—he uses an abrupt, almost brutal word for it—as a &quot;sod&quot; over which the nightingale sings. The contrast between the immortal nightingale and mortal man, sitting in his garden, is made all the more acute by an effort of the imagination.

==Reception==
Contemporary critics of Keats enjoyed the poem, and it was heavily quoted in their reviews. An anonymous review of Keats&#x27;s poetry that ran in the August and October 1820 &quot;Scots Magazine&quot; stated: &quot;Amongst the minor poems we prefer the &#x27;Ode to the Nightingale&#x27;. Indeed, we are inclined to prefer it beyond every other poem in the book; but let the reader judge. The third and seventh stanzas have a charm for us which we should find it difficult to explain. We have read this ode over and over again, and every time with increased delight.&quot; At the same time, Leigh Hunt wrote a review of Keats&#x27;s poem for the 2 August and 9 August 1820 &quot;The Indicator&quot;: &quot;As a specimen of the Poems, which are all lyrical, we must indulge ourselves in quoting entire the &#x27;Ode to a Nightingale&#x27;. There is that mixture in it of real melancholy and imaginative relief, which poetry alone presents us in her &#x27;charmed cup,&#x27; and which some over-rational critics have undertaken to find wrong because it is not true. It does not follow that what is not true to them, is not true to others. If the relief is real, the mixture is good and sufficing.&quot;

John Scott, in an anonymous review for the September 1820 edition of &quot;The London Magazine&quot;, argued for the greatness of Keats&#x27;s poetry as exemplified by poems including &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot;:
The injustice which has been done to our author&#x27;s works, in estimating their poetical merit, rendered us doubly anxious, on opening his last volume, to find it likely to seize fast hold of general sympathy, and thus turn an overwhelming power against the paltry traducers of talent, more eminently promising in many respects, than any the present age has been called upon to encourage. We have not found it to be quite all that we wished in this respect—and it would have been very extraordinary if we had, for our wishes went far beyond reasonable expectations. But we have found it of a nature to present to common understandings the poetical power with which the author&#x27;s mind is gifted, in a more tangible and intelligible shape than that in which it has appeared in any of his former compositions. It is, therefore, calculated to throw shame on the lying, vulgar spirit, in which this young worshipper in the temple of the Muses has been cried-down; whatever questions may still leave to be settled as to the kind and degree of his poetical merits. Take for instance, as proof of the justice of our praise, the following passage from an Ode to the Nightingale:--it is distinct, noble, pathetic, and true: the thoughts have all chords of direct communication with naturally-constituted hearts: the echoes of the strain linger bout the depths of human bosoms.

In a review for the 21 January 1835 &quot;London Journal&quot;, Hunt claimed that while Keats wrote the poem, &quot;The poet had then his mortal illness upon him, and knew it. Never was the voice of death sweeter.&quot; David Moir, in 1851, used &quot;The Eve of St Agnes&quot; to claim, &quot;We have here a specimen of descriptive power luxuriously rich and original; but the following lines, from the &#x27;Ode to a Nightingale,&#x27; flow from a far more profound fountain of inspiration.&quot;

At the end of the 19th century, Robert Bridges&#x27;s analysis of the poem became a dominant view and would influence later interpretations of the poem. Bridges, in 1895, declared that the poem was the best of Keats&#x27;s odes but he thought that the poem contained too much artificial language. In particular, he emphasised the use of the word &quot;forlorn&quot; and the last stanza as being examples of Keats&#x27;s artificial language. In &quot;Two odes of Keats&#x27;s&quot; (1897), William C Wilkinson suggested that &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot; is deeply flawed because it contains too many &quot;incoherent musings&quot; that failed to supply a standard of logic that would allow the reader to understand the relationship between the poet and the bird. However, Herbert Grierson, arguing in 1928, believed &quot;Nightingale&quot; to be superior to &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot;, &quot;Ode on Melancholy&quot;, and &quot;Ode to Psyche&quot;, arguing the exact opposite of Wilkinson as he stated that &quot;Nightingale&quot;, along with &quot;To Autumn&quot;, showed a greater amount of logical thought and more aptly presented the cases they were intended to make.

===20th-century criticism===
At the beginning of the 20th century, Rudyard Kipling referred to lines 69 and 70, alongside three lines from Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;Kubla Khan&quot;, when he claimed of poetry: &quot;In all the millions permitted there are no more than five—five little lines—of which one can say, &#x27;These are the magic. These are the vision. The rest is only Poetry.&#x27;&quot; In 1906, Alexander Mackie argued: &quot;The nightingale and the lark for long monopolised poetic idolatry—a privilege they enjoyed solely on account of their pre-eminence as song birds. Keats&#x27;s &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot; and Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Ode to a Skylark&quot; are two of the glories of English literature; but both were written by men who had no claim to special or exact knowledge of ornithology as such.&quot; Sidney Colvin, in 1920, argued, &quot;Throughout this ode Keats&#x27;s genius is at its height. Imagination cannot be more rich and satisfying, felicity of phrase and cadence cannot be more absolute, than in the several contrasted stanzas calling for the draft of southern vintage […] To praise the art of a passage like that in the fourth stanza […] to praise or comment on a stroke of art like this is to throw doubt on the reader&#x27;s power to perceive it for himself.&quot;

Bridges&#x27; view of &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot; was taken up by H. W. Garrod in his 1926 analysis of Keats&#x27;s poems. As Albert Gerard would argue later in 1944, Garrod believed that the problem within Keats&#x27;s poem was his emphasis on the rhythm and the language instead of the main ideas of the poem. When describing the fourth stanza of the poem, Maurice Ridley, in 1933, claimed, &quot;And so comes the stanza, with that remarkable piece of imagination at the end which feels the light as blown by the breezes, one of those characteristic sudden flashes with which Keats fires the most ordinary material.&quot; He later declared of the seventh stanza: &quot;And now for the great stanza in which the imagination is fanned to yet whiter heat, the stanza that would, I suppose, by common consent be taken, along with &quot;Kubla Khan&quot;, as offering us the distilled sorceries of &#x27;Romanticism&#x27;&quot;. He concluded on the stanza that &quot;I do not believe that any reader who has watched Keats at work on the more exquisitely finished of the stanzas in &quot;The Eve of St. Agnes&quot;, and seen this craftsman slowly elaborating and refining, will ever believe that this perfect stanza was achieved with the easy fluency with which, in the draft we have, it was obviously written down.&quot; In 1936, F. R. Leavis wrote, &quot;One remembers the poem both as recording, and as being for the reader, an indulgence.&quot; Following Leavis, Cleanth Brooks and Robert Penn Warren, in a 1938 essay, saw the poem as &quot;a very rich poem. It contains some complications which we must not gloss over if we are to appreciate the depth and significance of the issues engaged.&quot; Brooks would later argue in &quot;The Well-Wrought Urn&quot; (1947) that the poem was thematically unified while contradicting many of the negative criticisms lodged against the poem.

Richard Fogle responded to the critical attack on Keats&#x27;s emphasis on rhyme and language put forth by Garrod, Gerard, and others in 1953. His argument was similar to Brooks: that the poem was thematically coherent and that there is a poet within the poem that is different from Keats the writer of the poem. As such, Keats consciously chose the shift in the themes of the poem and the contrasts within the poem represent the pain felt when comparing the real world to an ideal world found within the imagination. Fogle also responded directly to the claims made by Leavis: &quot;I find Mr. Leavis too austere, but he points out a quality which Keats plainly sought for. His profusion and prodigality is, however, modified by a principle of sobriety.&quot; It is possible that Fogle&#x27;s statements were a defense of Romanticism as a group that was both respectable in terms of thought and poetic ability. Wasserman, following in 1953, claimed that &quot;Of all Keats&#x27; poems, it is probably the &#x27;Ode to a Nightingale&#x27; that has most tormented the critic [...] in any reading of the &#x27;Ode to a Nightingale&#x27; the turmoil will not down. Forces contend wildly within the poem, not only without resolution, but without possibility of resolution; and the reader comes away from his experience with the sense that he has been in &#x27;a wild Abyss&#x27;&quot;. He then explained, &quot;It is this turbulence, I suspect, that has led Allen Tate to believe the ode &#x27;at least tries to say everything that poetry can say.&#x27; But I propose it is the &#x27;Ode on a Grecian Urn&#x27; that succeeds in saying what poetry can say, and that the other ode attempts to say all that the &quot;poet&quot; can.&quot;

===Later critical responses===
Although the poem was defended by a few critics, E. C. Pettet returned to the argument that the poem lacked a structure and emphasized the word &quot;forlorn&quot; as evidence of his view. In his 1957 work, Pettet did praise the poem as he declared, &quot;The &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot; has a special interest in that most of us would probably regard it as the most richly representative of all Keats&#x27;s poems. Two reasons for this quality are immediately apparent: there is its matchless evocation of that late spring and early summer season […] and there is its exceptional degree of &#x27;distillation&#x27;, of concentrated recollection&quot;. David Perkins felt the need to defend the use of the word &quot;forlorn&quot; and claimed that it described the feeling from the impossibility of not being able to live in the world of the imagination. When praising the poem in 1959, Perkins claimed, &quot;Although the &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot; ranges more widely than the &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn,&quot; the poem can also be regarded as the exploration or testing out of a symbol, and, compared with the urn as a symbol, the nightingale would seem to have both limitations and advantages.&quot; Walter Jackson Bate also made a similar defense of the word &quot;forlorn&quot; by claiming that the world described by describing the impossibility of reaching that land. When describing the poem compared to the rest of English poetry, Bate argued in 1963, &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot; is among &quot;the greatest lyrics in English&quot; and the only one written with such speed: &quot;We are free to doubt whether any poem in English of comparable length and quality has been composed so quickly.&quot; In 1968, Robert Gittins stated, &quot;It may not be wrong to regard [&quot;Ode on Indolence&quot; and &quot;Ode on Melancholy&quot;] as Keats&#x27;s earlier essays in this [ode] form, and the great &quot;Nightingale&quot; and &quot;Grecian Urn&quot; as his more finished and later works.&quot;

From the late 1960s onward, many of the Yale School of critics describe the poem as a reworking of John Milton&#x27;s poetic diction, but, they argued, that poem revealed that Keats lacked the ability of Milton as a poet. The critics, Harold Bloom (1965), Leslie Brisman (1973), Paul Fry (1980), John Hollander (1981) and Cynthia Chase (1985), all focused on the poem with Milton as a progenitor to &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot; while ignoring other possibilities, including Shakespeare who was emphasised as being the source of many of Keats&#x27;s phrases. Responding to the claims about Milton and Keats&#x27;s shortcomings, critics like R. S. White (1981) and Willard Spiegelman (1983) used the Shakespearean echoes to argue for a multiplicity of sources for the poem to claim that Keats was not trying to respond just to Milton or escape from his shadow. Instead, &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot; was an original poem, as White claimed, &quot;The poem is richly saturated in Shakespeare, yet the assimilations are so profound that the Ode is finally original, and wholly Keatsian&quot;. Similarly, Spiegelman claimed that Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; had &quot;flavored and ripened the later poem&quot;. This was followed in 1986 by Jonathan Bate claiming that Keats was &quot;left enriched by the voice of Shakespeare, the &#x27;immortal bird&#x27;&quot;.

Focusing on the quality of the poem, Stuart Sperry, argued in 1973, &quot;&#x27;Ode to a Nightingale&#x27; is the supreme expression in all Keats&#x27;s poetry of the impulse to imaginative escape that flies in the face of the knowledge of human limitation, the impulse fully expressed in &#x27;Away! away! for I &quot;will&quot; fly to thee.&#x27;&quot; Wolf Hirst, in 1981, described the poem as &quot;justly celebrated&quot; and claimed that &quot;Since this movement into an eternal realm of song is one of the most magnificent in literature, the poet&#x27;s return to actuality is all the more shattering.&quot; Helen Vendler continued the earlier view that the poem was artificial but added that the poem was an attempt to be aesthetic and spontaneous that was later dropped. In 1983, she argued, &quot;In its absence of conclusiveness and its abandonment to reverie, the poem appeals to readers who prize it as the most personal, the most apparently spontaneous, the most immediately beautiful, and the most confessional of Keats&#x27;s odes. I believe that the &#x27;events&#x27; of the ode, as it unfolds in time, have more logic, however, than is usually granted them, and that they are best seen in relation to Keats&#x27;s pursuit of the idea of music as a nonrepresentational art.&quot;

In a review of contemporary criticism of &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot; in 1998, James O&#x27;Rouke claimed that &quot;To judge from the volume, the variety, and the polemical force of the modern critical responses engendered, there have been few moments in English poetic history as baffling as Keats&#x27;s repetition of the word &#x27;forlorn&#x27;&quot;. When referring to the reliance of the ideas of John Dryden and William Hazlitt within the poem, Poet Laureate Andrew Motion, in 1999, argued &quot;whose notion of poetry as a &#x27;movement&#x27; from personal consciousness to an awareness of suffering humanity it perfectly illustrates.&quot;

==Musical settings==
Settings of the ode began to emerge at the end of the 19th century. The earliest comprised only the second half of the eighth stanza, beginning &quot;Adieu, adieu! They plaintive anthem fades&quot;. This was included in the cantata &quot;The Swan and the Skylark&quot; by Arthur Goring Thomas, which was orchestrated after the composer&#x27;s suicide by Charles Villiers Stanford and first performed in 1894.

The length of Keats&#x27; poem lent itself to more ambitious choral treatment by later composers, including Richard Henry Walthew&#x27;s setting for baritone, chorus, and orchestra (1897), and Ernest Walker&#x27;s, published in 1908 and performed the following year. Later in the 20th century came Valentyn Silvestrov&#x27;s cantata for soprano, piano and chamber orchestra, a 1973 setting in three movements of a Russian translation by Yevgeny Vitkovsky (1950–2020); and in the 21st century Will Todd&#x27;s Choral Symphony 4 for choir and orchestra was commissioned by the Hertfordshire Chorus and first performed in 2011.

The ode was also set as an art song by such British composers as Cecil Forsyth, for baritone and piano or small orchestra (published 1894); Hamilton Harty, for soprano and orchestra, first performed in 1907; and Eric Fogg, for baritone, string quartet and harp, first performed in 1926. There have also been American settings, such as that by George Antheil for flute, viola and piano to accompany a recitation of the poem (1950), as well as others by Reginald Chauncey Robbins (1871–1955), for bass or baritone and piano (published 1922), and by Stephen Douglas Burton for coloratura soprano, flute, harp, and strings (published 1963). 

More recently, Geoffrey Gordon published a setting for chamber choir and solo cello in 2017; Ben Moore&#x27;s followed in 2018 in a specially commissioned work for baritone and piano, and there was an Australian performance of Michael Dooley&#x27;s setting for soprano in 2020.

<doc id="236289" wikidata="Q7768168" url="?curid=236289" title="The Tay Bridge Disaster">
<text>&quot;The Tay Bridge Disaster&quot; is a poem written in 1880 by the Scottish poet William McGonagall, who has been acclaimed as the worst poet in history. The poem recounts the events of the evening of 28 December 1879, when, during a severe gale, the Tay Rail Bridge at Dundee collapsed as a train was passing over it with the loss of all on board. The number of deaths was actually 75, not 90 as stated in the poem. The foundations of the bridge were not removed and are alongside the newer bridge.

==The poem==
The poem is among McGonagall&#x27;s most well-known works, and has been lampooned by critics as one of the worst poems in the English language. It begins:

:&quot;Beautiful railway bridge of the silv&#x27;ry Tay
:Alas! I am very sorry to say
:That ninety lives have been taken away
:On the last sabbath day of 1879
:Which will be remember&#x27;d for a very long time.&quot;

And it ends:

:&quot;Oh! Ill-fated bridge of the silv&#x27;ry Tay,
:I now must conclude my lay
:By telling the world fearlessly without the least dismay,
:That your central girders would not have given way,
:At least many sensible men do say,
:Had they been supported on each side with buttresses
:At least many sensible men confesses,
:For the stronger we our houses do build,
:The less chance we have of being killed.&quot;

William McGonagall wrote two other poems about the Tay bridges. The first one, written before the disaster about the first bridge, begins as follows:

The Railway Bridge of the Silvery Tay:

:&quot;Beautiful Railway Bridge of the Silvery Tay!
:With your numerous arches and pillars in so grand array,
:And your central girders, which seem to the eye
:To be almost towering to the sky&quot;

And it ends:

:&quot;Beautiful Railway Bridge of the Silvery Tay!
:I hope that God will protect all passengers
:By night and by day,
:And that no accident will befall them while crossing
:The Bridge of the Silvery Tay,
:For that would be most awful to be seen
:Nearby Dundee and the Magdalen Green.

:Beautiful Railway Bridge of the Silvery Tay!
:And prosperity to Messrs Bouche and Grothe,
:The famous engineers of the present day,
:Who have succeeded in erecting the Railway
:Bridge of the Silvery Tay,
:Which stands unequalled to be seen
:Nearby Dundee and the Magdalen Green.&quot;

After the original bridge collapsed, a new one was built, providing the opportunity for another poem, which begins:

An Address to the New Tay Bridge

:&quot;BEAUTIFUL new railway bridge of the Silvery Tay,
:With your strong brick piers and buttresses in so grand array,
:And your thirteen central girders, which seem to my eye
:Strong enough all windy storms to defy.&quot;

==Criticism==
This and other examples of McGonagall&#x27;s work are often held to be risibly bad poetry. Although McGonagall is obsessive about rhyme, he often repeats the same rhyming pairs. The lines are sometimes of inordinate length and lack any form of scansion or metre. Finally, any pathos generated by the rambling narrative is usually dispelled by the inclusion of inappropriate or irrelevant details. On the other hand, Professor Kirstie Blair contends that McGonagall&#x27;s poems are no better or worse than most of the broadside ballads that were sold on the streets of Scotland in the 19th-century, whose authors have long since sunk into obscurity.

<doc id="236293" wikidata="Q220359" url="?curid=236293" title="Zoot Suit Riots">
<text>The Zoot Suit Riots were a series of riots that took place June 3–8, 1943, in Los Angeles, California, United States, involving American servicemen stationed in Southern California and young Latino and Mexican American city residents. It was one of the dozen wartime industrial cities where race-related riots occurred during the summer of 1943, along with Mobile, Alabama; Beaumont, Texas; Detroit, Michigan; and New York City.

American servicemen and white Angelenos attacked and stripped children, teenagers, and youths who wore zoot suits, ostensibly because they considered the outfits, which were made from large amounts of fabric, to be unpatriotic during World War II. Rationing of fabrics and certain foods was required at the time for the war effort. While most of the white mobs targeted Mexican American youth, they also attacked African American and Filipino American young adults and children.

The Zoot Suit Riots followed the Sleepy Lagoon murder trial, after the death of a young Latino man in what was then an unincorporated commercial area near Los Angeles. Similar racist violence against Latinos happened in Chicago, San Diego, Oakland, Evansville, Philadelphia, and New York City as well. The defiance of zoot suiters became inspirational for Chicanos during the Chicano Movement.

==Background==
===Mexicans in Los Angeles===
California was a part of Mexico for 27 years, and part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain for centuries, before becoming part of the United States following the Mexican–American War. Because of this history, there has always been a large Latino population in California. During the early 20th century, many Mexicans immigrated for work to US border states that needed workers, areas such as Texas, Arizona, and California. They were recruited by farmers for work on the large farms and also worked in those states in non-agricultural jobs.

During the Great Depression, in the early 1930s, the United States deported between 500,000 and 2 million people of Mexican descent (including the expulsion of up to 1.2 million children who were U.S. citizens but accompanied their parents back to Mexico.) to Mexico (see Mexican Repatriation), in order to reduce demands on limited American economic resources. By the late 1930s, about three million Mexican Americans resided in the United States. Los Angeles had the highest concentration of ethnic Mexicans outside Mexico.

Job discrimination in Los Angeles forced minorities to work for below poverty level wages. The Los Angeles newspapers described Mexicans with racially inflammatory propaganda, suggesting a problem with juvenile delinquency. These factors caused much racial tension between Mexican immigrants, those of Mexican descent, and European Americans.

During this time, Los Angeles was undergoing an expansion, which caused disruptions in communal sites, family sites, and family patterns of social interactions due to poor city planning. One major decision was to put a million-dollar Naval training school for the Naval Reserve Armory in the Chavez Ravine, a primarily working-class and immigrant area for Mexican-Americans. As young Mexican-American men from the neighborhood grew agitated and began a campaign of harassment, intimidation, and resistance a year prior to the riots, the Chavez Ravine area would later be a hot spot for encounters between the zoot suiters and sailors.

Lalo Guerrero became known as the father of Chicano music, as young people adopted music, language, and dress of their own. Young men wore zoot suits—a flamboyant long jacket with baggy pegged pants, sometimes accessorized with a pork pie hat, a long watch chain, and thick-soled shoes. They called themselves pachucos. In the early 1940s, arrests of Mexican-American youths and negative stories in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; fueled a perception that these pachuco gangs were delinquents who were a threat to the broader community.

In the summer of 1942, the Sleepy Lagoon murder case made national news. Nine teenage members of the 38th Street Gang were accused of murdering a civilian man named José Díaz in an abandoned quarry pit. The nine defendants were convicted at trial and sentenced to long prison terms. Eduardo Obregón Pagán wrote:

Many Angelenos saw the death of José Díaz as a tragedy that resulted from a larger pattern of lawlessness and rebellion among Mexican American youths, discerned through their self-conscious fashioning of difference, and increasingly called for stronger measures to crack down on juvenile delinquency.

The convictions of the nine young men were ultimately overturned, but the case generated much animosity within the United States toward Mexican Americans. The police and press characterized all Mexican youths as &quot;pachuco hoodlums and baby gangsters&quot;.

===World War II===
With the entry of the United States into World War II in December 1941 following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the nation had to deal with the restrictions of rationing and the prospects of conscription. In March 1942, the War Production Board (WPB) regulated the manufacture of men&#x27;s suits and all clothing that contained wool. To achieve a 26% cut-back in the use of fabrics, the WPB issued regulations for the manufacture of what &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine called, &quot;streamlined suits by Uncle Sam&quot;. The regulations effectively forbade the manufacture of the wide-cut zoot suits and full women&#x27;s skirts or dresses. Most legitimate tailoring companies ceased to manufacture or advertise any suits that fell outside the War Production Board&#x27;s guidelines. But the demand for zoot suits did not decline; a network of bootleg tailors based in Los Angeles and New York City continued to produce the garments. Youths also continued to wear clothes which they already owned.

Meanwhile, American soldiers, sailors, and Marines from across the country travelled to Los Angeles in large numbers as part of the war effort; they were given leave while awaiting to be shipped out to the Pacific theater. Servicemen and zoot suiters in Los Angeles were both immediately identifiable by their dress. Some servicemen and others in the community felt that the continued wearing of zoot suits represented the youths&#x27; public flouting of rationing regulations. Officials began to cast wearing of zoot suits in moral terms and associated it with the commission of petty crime, violence and the snubbing of national wartime rules. In 1943, many servicemen resented the sight of young Latinos wearing zoot suits after clothing restrictions had been published, especially as most came from areas of the country with little experience or knowledge of Mexican-American culture. Although Mexican-Americans were overrepresented in the armed forces, they were not common or respected enough to defuse these tensions.

One of the first conflicts between the sailors and the zoot suiters was in August 1942, near Chinatown. The sailors who trained in the Chavez Ravine went to Chinatown on leave. A sailor and his girlfriend were walking when four zoot suiters blocked the sidewalk in front of them. The zoot suiters refused to let them pass and pushed the sailor into the street. The young zoot-suiter and the sailor stood their ground in silence until finally, the sailor backed away.

=== Zoot suits ===

Zoot suit fashion found its origins in the urban black scene during the 1940s. This style of clothing cultivated a sense of racial pride and significance; however, the fashion statement soon made its way into the wardrobes of young Southern Californian Mexican Americans, Italians and Filipinos, who became the quintessential wearers of the zoot suit. The transfer and sharing of the zoot suit fashion indicated a growing influence of African American popular culture on young Mexican American, Italian American and Filipino Americans. Additionally, &quot;analysis of the Los Angeles zoot-suit riot and journalists&#x27; and politicians&#x27; in and the outfit&#x27;s connections with race relations, slang, jazz music and dance permit an understanding of the politics and social significance of what is trivial in itself -- popular culture and its attendant styles&quot;.

The zoot suit was originally a statement about creating a new wave of music and dress, but it also held significant political meaning. The flamboyant and colorful material indicated a desire to express oneself against the boring and somber slum lifestyle. The zoot suit provided young African American and Mexican youth a sense of individualistic identity within their cultures and society as they discovered &quot;highly charged emotional and symbolic meaning&quot; through the movement, music, and dress.

The zoot suit typically included bright-colored fabric, long suit coats that often reached the knees, wide shoulders, and gathered or tapered pants. The arm and ankle areas were often much tighter than the rest of the fabric, giving the whole look a triangular shape.

Often the suit was paired with accessories such as chains and leather-soled shoes, which were typically worn to exaggerate and prove a point of rebellion standing against the wealth and status that many of these youth were unable to access due to their economic and racial identities.

=== Pachucas and Chicanas ===
The urban, Mexican-American youth often called themselves &quot;pachucos&quot;. The female parallels were called &quot;pachucas&quot; and wore tight sweaters and relatively full, flared skirts, often paired with high hair-dos, large earrings, and heavy makeup. Many young Mexican-American women who were not pachucas avoided these clothing styles and hairstyles in order to avoid being seen as troublemakers by white people. Some women even reported that they had heard of pachucas hiding knives in their hair.

Pachucas formed their own gangs, joined the male pachuco gangs, and carried weapons. This behavior was often said to have been a divergence from the expected feminine beauty and manners of the middle-class. Often, for parents of Mexican-American girls, the pachucas &quot;embodied not only a dissident femininity but a threatening, distinctly American identity as well&quot;. For some young women, the characteristics of the style promoted a sense of social mobility and &quot;cultural hybridity&quot; that was expressed through &quot;increased interracial/ethnic relations, bilingualism, and pachuco slang&quot;.

Pachucas and Chicanas were less referred to in the media, partly because they threatened the gender and sexuality norms that existed at the time. When acknowledged, they were regarded mainly as secondary members to the male gang members. Many scholars exclude the pachuca narrative in major events in the Chicano movement. Events like the Sleepy Lagoon incident of 1942 and Zoot Suit Riots of 1943 have been described as &quot;a boyish fight over a pretty girl&quot; and a brawl involving &quot;homeboys&quot;. However, records show that many women also participated in these events and had important roles in shaping their outcomes. In the Sleepy Lagoon incident, both men and women were attacked by a group of youths that later court documents referred to as the &quot;Downey Boys&quot;. The pachucos and pachucas left Sleepy Lagoon after the attack, heading to the 38th Street neighborhood to gather reinforcements. They returned to Sleepy Lagoon to find that the Downey Boys had departed, and then headed to a party at the Williams Ranch where a fight broke out upon their arrival. Claims have asserted that there were women screaming and yelling as the fighting ensued.

Continuing into the end of World War II, Mexican-American women were at the center of much conflict between Anglo-American servicemen and Mexican American youths. In the weeks before the riots, servicemen reported that pachucos had been harassing, molesting, raping, and insulting their wives, girlfriends, and relatives. One local Los Angeles newspaper included a story of two young women who had allegedly been abducted in downtown and raped in a &quot;zoot suit orgy&quot;. Many of these reports began building up and was one of the major instigators of the coming riots, as servicemen had declared that they will take matters into their own hands since the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) had supposedly done nothing to stop the attacks from pachucos on their women. On the contrary, Horace R. Cayton, a writer for the &quot;Pittsburgh Courier&quot;, &quot;attributed the riots to non-Mexican servicemen, who he claimed envied Mexican American male zooters and desired the &#x27;pretty brown creatures&#x27; with whom they consorted&quot;. However, the press was dominated by the stories which often claimed that &quot;loose . . . girls of the Los Angeles Mexican quarter&quot; were responsible for taking advantage of unaware sailors who had money.

== Prelude ==

Following the Sleepy Lagoon case, U.S. service personnel got into violent altercations with young Mexican Americans in zoot suits in San Jose, Oakland, San Diego, Delano, Los Angeles, and smaller cities and towns in California. During this period, the immense war buildup attracted tens of thousands of new workers to factories and shipyards in the West Coast, including African Americans from the South in the second wave of the Great Migration.

The most serious ethnic conflicts erupted in Los Angeles. Two altercations between military personnel and zoot suiters catalyzed the larger riots. The first occurred on May 30, 1943, at around 8:00 p.m., four days before the start of the riots. A dozen sailors, including Seaman Second Class Joe Dacy Coleman, were walking down Main Street in Los Angeles when they spotted a group of Mexican women on the opposite side. The group, except for Coleman, crossed the street to speak to the women. Coleman continued, walking past two zoot suiters when the sailor turned and grabbed the arm of one of the young men.

==Riots==
===Attacks begin===
On the night of June 3, 1943, about eleven sailors got off a bus and started walking along Main Street in Downtown Los Angeles. Encountering a group of young Mexican Americans in zoot suits, they got into an argument. The sailors later told the LAPD that they were jumped and beaten by this gang, while the zoot suiters claimed the altercation was started by the sailors. The LAPD responded to the incident, including many off-duty officers who identified as the Vengeance Squad. The officers went to the scene &quot;seeking to clean up Main Street from what they viewed as the loathsome influence of pachuco gangs&quot;.

The next day, 200 sailors got a convoy of about 20 taxicabs and headed for East Los Angeles, the center of Mexican-American settlement. The sailors spotted a group of young zoot suiters and assaulted them with clubs. They stripped the boys of the zoot suits and burned the tattered clothes in a pile. They attacked and stripped everyone they came across who were wearing zoot suits. Media coverage of the incidents then started to spread, inducing more people to join in the mayhem.

===Attacks spread===
During the next few days, thousands of servicemen and residents joined the attacks, marching abreast down streets, entering bars and movie houses, and assaulting any young Mexican American males they encountered. In one incident, sailors dragged two zoot suiters on-stage as a film was being screened, stripped them in front of the audience, and then urinated on their suits. Although police accompanied the rioters, they had orders not to arrest any, and some of them joined in the rioting. After several days, more than 150 people had been injured, and the police had arrested more than 500 Mexican American civilians on charges ranging from &quot;rioting&quot; to &quot;vagrancy&quot;.

A witness to the attacks, journalist Carey McWilliams wrote,

Marching through the streets of downtown Los Angeles, a mob of several thousand soldiers, sailors, and civilians, proceeded to beat up every zoot suiter they could find. Pushing its way into the important motion picture theaters, the mob ordered the management to turn on the house lights and then ran up and down the aisles dragging Mexicans out of their seats. Streetcars were halted while Mexicans, and some Filipinos and Negroes, were jerked from their seats, pushed into the streets and beaten with a sadistic frenzy.

The local press lauded the attacks, describing them as having a &quot;cleansing effect&quot; to rid Los Angeles of &quot;miscreants&quot; and &quot;hoodlums&quot;. As the riots progressed, the media reported the arrest of Amelia Venegas, a female zoot suiter charged with carrying a brass knuckleduster. While the revelation of female pachucos&#x27; (pachucas) involvement in the riots led to frequent coverage of the activities of female pachuca gangs, the media suppressed any mention of the white mobs that were also involved.

The Los Angeles City Council approved a resolution criminalizing the wearing of &quot;zoot suits with reat pleats within the city limits of LA&quot; with the expectation that Mayor Fletcher Bowron would sign it into law. Councilman Norris Nelson had stated, &quot;The zoot suit has become a badge of hoodlumism.&quot; No ordinance was approved by the City Council or signed into law by the Mayor, but the council encouraged the WPB to take steps &quot;to curb illegal production of men&#x27;s clothing in violation of WPB limitation orders&quot;. While the mobs had first targeted only pachucos, they also attacked African Americans in zoot suits who lived in the Central Avenue corridor area. The Navy and Marine Corps command staffs intervened on June 8 to reduce the attacks, confining sailors and Marines to barracks and ordering that Los Angeles be declared off-limits to all military personnel; this was enforced by Navy Shore Patrol personnel. Their official position was that their men were acting in self-defense.

==Reactions==

As the riots subsided, the most urgent concern of officials was relations with Mexico, as the economy of Southern California relied on the importation of cheap Mexican labor to assist in the harvesting of California crops. After the Mexican Embassy lodged a formal protest with the State Department, Governor Earl Warren of California ordered the creation of the McGucken Committee (headed by Los Angeles bishop Joseph McGucken) to investigate and determine the cause of the riots. In 1943, the committee issued its report; it determined racism to be a central cause of the riots, further stating that it was &quot;an aggravating practice (of the media) to link the phrase &quot;zoot suit&quot; with the report of a crime&quot;. The governor appointed the Peace Officers Committee on Civil Disturbances, chaired by Robert W. Kenny, president of the National Lawyers Guild to make recommendations to the police. Human relations committees were appointed, and police departments were required to train their officers to treat all citizens equally. Mayor Fletcher Bowron downplayed the role racial prejudice played in the riots and blamed Mexican youth gangs.

On June 16, 1943, a week after the riots, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt commented on the riots in her newspaper column. &quot;The question goes deeper than just suits. It is a racial protest. I have been worried for a long time about the Mexican racial situation. It is a problem with roots going a long way back, and we do not always face these problems as we should.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; published an editorial the next day expressing outrage: it accused Mrs. Roosevelt of having communist leanings and stirring &quot;race discord&quot;.

On June 21, 1943, the State Un-American Activities Committee, under state senator Jack Tenney, arrived in Los Angeles with orders to &quot;determine whether the present Zoot Suit Riots were sponsored by Nazi agencies attempting to spread disunity between the United States and Latin-American countries&quot;. Although Tenney claimed he had evidence the riots were &quot;[A]xis-sponsored&quot;, no evidence was ever presented to support this claim. Japanese propaganda broadcasts accused the U.S. government of ignoring the brutality of U.S. Marines toward Mexicans. In late 1944, ignoring the findings of the McGucken committee and the unanimous reversal of the convictions by the appeals court in the Sleepy Lagoon case on October 4, the Tenney Committee announced that the National Lawyers Guild was an &quot;effective communist front&quot;.

Later scholars generally characterize the Zoot Suit riots as a &quot;pogrom against the Mexican American community&quot;. Many post-war civil rights activists and authors, such as Luis Valdez, Ralph Ellison, and Richard Wright, have said they were inspired by the Zoot Suit Riots. Cesar Chavez and Malcolm X were both zoot suiters as young men who later became political activists.

On June 9, 2023, roughly 80 years after the attacks, the Los Angeles City Council publicly condemned the Zoot Suit riots and apologized for its role in contributing to it.

<doc id="236294" wikidata="Q5035443" url="?curid=236294" title="Capital Adequacy Directive">
<text>The Capital Adequacy Directive was a European directive that aimed to establish uniform capital requirements for both banking firms and non-bank securities firms, first issued in 1993 and revised in 1998. These was superseded by the Capital Requirements Directives starting in 2006.

==History==
The original 93/6/EEC (CAD1) directive was amended by 98/31/EEC (CAD2), to incorporate banks&#x27; own estimate of capital using value-at-risk techniques. Annex 1 models were virtually unchanged by CAD2, so there has been no change in the CAD1 regime.

A third revision of the directive 2006/49/EC was issued on 14 June 2006 and would use the new name of Capital Requirements Directive (CRD). This came into force together with recast of a related banking directive on 20 July 2006. The main change was the adoption of Basel II guidelines into the directive.

In 2009, 2010, and 2013, three further revisions were issued known as CRD II, CRD III, and CRD IV. The legislation on this matter current is known as the CRD IV package (Capital Requirements Regulation and Directive).

<doc id="236295" wikidata="Q189139" url="?curid=236295" title="Ioannis Metaxas">
<text>Ioannis Metaxas (12 April 187129 January 1941) was a Greek military officer and politician who was dictator of Greece from 1936 until his death in 1941. He governed constitutionally for the first four months of his tenure, and thereafter as the strongman leader of the 4th of August Regime following his appointment by King George II.

Born to an aristocratic family in Ithaca, Metaxas took part in the Greco-Turkish War of 1897 and the Balkan Wars (1912–13), and quickly rose through the ranks of the Hellenic Army. As a monarchist during the National Schism, Metaxas unsuccessfully opposed Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos and Greece&#x27;s entry in World War I; he was exiled to Corsica in response in 1917. On his return, Metaxas moved into politics and founded the Freethinkers&#x27; Party, but had only limited success under the Second Hellenic Republic.

Metaxas was appointed prime minister in April 1936, a year after the Greek monarchy was restored. With the support of King George II, Metaxas initiated a self-coup and established an authoritarian, nationalist, and anti-communist regime, which Metaxas himself and some historians called totalitarian. The ideology and system associated with his rule, Metaxism, has been described as a form of Fascism, or a conventional authoritarian-conservative dictatorship, or a regime with a strong fascist component.

On 28 October 1940, Metaxas rejected an ultimatum imposed by the Italians to surrender, committing Greece to the Allies and bringing the country into the war. He died in January 1941, before the German invasion and subsequent fall of Greece.

==Military career==

Ioannis Metaxas was born in Ithaca in 1871. His family was inscribed in the &quot;Libro d&#x27;Oro&quot; of the Ionian islands, previously a Venetian possession, while its roots originated in the Byzantine nobility. The Metaxas family were entered into the &quot;Libro d&#x27;Oro&quot; in the 17th century. Metaxas was very proud of his aristocratic family, observing that many ancestors of ordinary Greeks were not notable enough to be included in the &quot;Libro d&#x27;Oro&quot;.

Following studies at the Hellenic Military Academy, he became a career military officer, being sworn as an Engineers 2nd Lieutenant on 10 August 1890. He first saw action in the Greco-Turkish War of 1897 attached to the staff of the Greek commander-in-chief, Crown Prince Constantine.

Metaxas became a protégé of Constantine and much of his rise through the ranks of the Hellenic Army was a consequence of Crown Prince&#x27;s patronage. Greece was characterized by a clientist system at the time, and a powerful patron in the form of Constantine boosted Metaxas&#x27;s career.

After the war, he continued his military studies at the Berlin War Academy from 1899 to 1903. Metaxas was very close to Constantine and was personally selected by the Crown Prince to go to Berlin. During his time at the War Academy, Metaxas received consistently high marks from his German instructors with one writing that he was &quot;ein kleiner Moltke&quot; (&quot;a little Moltke&quot; – a reference to Metaxas&#x27;s short stature). Metaxas&#x27;s time in Germany made him into an admirer of Prussian militarism.

In his diary in March 1900, he wrote: &quot;I have no other ambition than to fulfill my duty to my king and crown prince ... I consider the king the representative of the past, present and future of the nation. All opposition to him from whatever quarter I reject and find repulsive.&quot; Metaxas also expressed his opposition to the &quot;intemperate parliamentarism&quot; of Greece, preferring the authoritarian German system where the Chancellor was responsible to the Emperor, not the &quot;Reichstag&quot;. On his return in 1904, he joined the newly formed General Staff Corps. He was part of the modernizing process of the Greek Army before the Balkan Wars (1912–13). However, he opposed the Goudi coup. For Metaxas, the coup represented an attack on everything he valued because the Military League behind the coup were opposed to Constantine and the other princes holding positions of command.

===Balkan Wars===

In 1910, Metaxas was appointed by Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos, who had also assumed the post of Minister of Military Affairs, as his adjutant. Venizelos appointed Metaxas as part of an effort at rapprochement with the monarchy. Despite Venizelos&#x27;s efforts to reach out, Metaxas was strongly opposed to his decision to have a French military mission arrive to train the Greek Army, and almost resigned in protest. In 1912, just before the Balkan Wars, Venizelos appointed Metaxas to negotiate the military treaty between Greece and Bulgaria, sending him to Sofia. He participated in the First Balkan War as a captain in the operations staff of the Army of Thessaly, before joining Venizelos as a military expert in the London Conference of 1912–13 in December 1912. In May 1913, as military plenipotentiary, he negotiated the military terms of the Greek–Serbian Alliance.

He took part in the Second Balkan War when he was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel.
After the end of the Balkan Wars, he was appointed director of the 1st (Operations) Directorate of the Army Staff Service, and became deputy head of the Staff Service in January 1915. In October 1913, he was awarded by the King with the Golden Cross of the Redeemer.

===Greco-Turkish crisis of 1914===
In the spring and summer of 1914, Greece found itself in a confrontation with the Ottoman Empire over the status of the eastern Aegean islands, which had been occupied by Greece in the First Balkan War, and were finally awarded to Greece on 31 January 1914 by the Great Powers. The Ottomans refused to accept this, leading to a naval arms race between the two countries and persecutions of Greeks in Asia Minor. On 29 May, the Greek government issued an official protest to the Sublime Porte, threatening a breach of relations and even war, if the persecutions were not stopped.

On 6 June 1914, Metaxas, as the &quot;de facto&quot; head of the Staff Service, presented a study on the military options against the Ottoman Empire: the most decisive maneuver, a landing of the entire Greek army in Asia Minor, was virtually impossible due to the hostility with Bulgaria; instead, Metaxas proposed the sudden occupation of the Gallipoli Peninsula, without a prior declaration of war, the clearing of the Dardanelles, and the occupation of Constantinople so as to force the Ottomans to negotiate. However, on the previous day, the Ottoman government had suggested mutual talks, and the tension eased enough for Prime Minister Venizelos and the Ottoman Grand Vizier, Said Halim Pasha, to meet in Brussels in July.

===World War I and the National Schism===

Following the outbreak of World War I, the prospect of Greece&#x27;s possible entry into the war emerged, especially given the obligation to provide military assistance to Serbia based on the Greek–Serbian Alliance. By 12 July 1914, the Serbian government had requested Greece&#x27;s aid following the terms of the alliance, in the case of an Austrian and Bulgarian attack. Greece rejected the request on the grounds that Serbia had undertaken to provide 150,000 troops in the area of Gevgelija to guard against a Bulgarian attack; in addition, if Greece sent her army to fight the Austrians along the Danube, this would only incite a Bulgarian attack against both countries, with insufficient forces left to oppose it.

====Clash with Venizelos over Greece&#x27;s entry in the war====
A German request on 14 July to join the Central Powers was rejected by both Venizelos and King Constantine, but on 1 August, Venizelos sounded out the Entente Powers, Britain, France, and Russia. The Entente governments were lukewarm to Venizelos&#x27; proposals, since they hoped to entice Bulgaria on their side, even offering territorial concessions at the expense of Serbia, Greece, and Romania. Russia in particular considered her interests best served if Greece remained neutral.

On 19 November, Serbia repeated its request for Greek assistance, supported by the Entente. Venizelos asked Metaxas for an evaluation of the situation; the opinion of the latter was that without a simultaneous entry of Romania into the war on the side of the Allies, Greece&#x27;s position was too risky. Following the firm refusal of Romania to be drawn into the conflict at this time, the proposal was scuttled.

On 11 January 1915, the British offered Greece &quot;significant territorial concessions in Asia Minor&quot; if it would enter the war to support Serbia, and in exchange for satisfying some of the Bulgarian territorial demands in Macedonia (Kavala, Drama, and Chrysoupolis) in exchange for Bulgarian entry into the war on the side of the Entente.

Venizelos argued in favor of the proposal, but Metaxas disagreed, for reasons which he laid down in a memorandum on 20 January: the Austrians were likely to defeat the Serbian army before a Greek mobilization could be completed, Bulgaria was likely to flank any Greek forces fighting against the Austrians, while a Romanian intervention would not be decisive. Metaxas judged that even if Bulgaria joined the Entente, it still would not suffice to shift the balance in Central Europe, and recommended the presence of four Allied army corps in Macedonia as the minimum necessary force for any substantial aid to the Greeks and Serbs. Furthermore, Metaxas argued that a Greek entry into the war would once again expose the Greeks of Asia Minor to Turkish reprisals. Venizelos rejected this report, and recommended entry into the war in a memorandum to the King, provided that Bulgaria and Romania also joined the Entente. By that time, however, it was clear that Bulgaria was aligning towards the Central Powers, and Romania&#x27;s determination to remain neutral led the Greek government to again refuse.

However, in February 1915, the Entente attack on Gallipoli began. Venizelos decided to offer an army corps and the entire Greek fleet to assist the Entente, making an official offer on 16 February, despite the King&#x27;s reservations. This caused Metaxas to resign on the next day in protest, basing his argument on the loss of the element of surprise, the fortification of the straits, the fact that a single army corps was insufficient to alter the balance of forces, and the uncertain stance of Bulgaria. Metaxas insisted that the campaign had been mishandled thus far, and that even if the Entente captured Gallipoli, the Turks still fielded 12 divisions in Eastern Thrace. Shaken by Metaxas&#x27;s resignation, Venizelos convened meetings of the Crown Council (the King, Venizelos, and the living former prime ministers) on 18 and 20 February, but they proved indecisive. King Constantine decided to keep the country neutral, whereupon Venizelos submitted his resignation on 21 February 1915.

Venizelos won the May 1915 elections, and formed a new government on 17 August. When Bulgaria signed a treaty of alliance with Germany and mobilized against Serbia, Venizelos ordered a Greek counter-mobilization (10 September 1916). As part of the mobilization, Metaxas was recalled to active duty as deputy chief of staff. After Venizelos condoned the landing of British and French troops in Thessaloniki to aid the collapsing Serbian army, Venizelos presented his case for participation in the war to Parliament, securing 152 votes in favor to 102 against in a vote during the early hours of 22 September. On the next day, however, King Constantine dismissed Venizelos, and called upon Alexandros Zaimis to form a government.

====Reservists and Noemvriana====
This dismissal solidified the rift between monarchists and Venizelists, creating the &quot;National Schism&quot; that would be a centerpiece of Greek politics for decades.

In May and August 1916, Constantine and the General Staff allowed Fort Roupel and parts of eastern Macedonia to be occupied, without opposition, by the Central Powers (Germany and Bulgaria), as a counterbalance to the Allied presence in Thessaloniki. This caused popular anger, especially in Greek Macedonia, and among Venizelist officers.

In August 1916, Venizelist officers launched a revolt in Greece&#x27;s northern city of Thessaloniki, which resulted in the establishment of a separate &quot;Government of National Defence&quot; under Venizelos. The new government, with the Allied support, expanded its control over half the country and entered the war on the Allies&#x27; side.

Meanwhile, the official Greek state and the royal government remained neutral. King Constantine and Metaxas were accused as pro-German by their Venizelist opponents. However they kept negotiating with the Allies a possible entry with their side.

Metaxas was later the creator and head of the monarchist paramilitary Epistratoi (reservists) forces during the Noemvriana events in Athens. When the French/British landed in Athens and demanded the surrender of material equal lost to Fort Rupel (as guarantee for Greece&#x27;s neutrality), they met resistance. In June 1917, under Allied pressure, King Constantine was deposed, Alexander became King, and Venizelos came to power, declaring war officially on behalf of the whole country on 29 June 1917.

==Exile and interwar political career==
With Venizelos&#x27; coming to power in Summer 1917, Metaxas, along with other notable antivenizelists, were exiled to Corsica, from where he escaped to Sardinia (with Gounaris and Pesmazoglou) and later found himself with his family to Siena, Italy, while King Constantine with the royal family left for Switzerland. In January 1920, Metaxas was sentenced to death in absentia for his role in the Noemvriana.

He returned to Greece in November 1920, after the electoral defeat of Eleftherios Venizelos. He was reinstated in the army with the rank of Major General, but as he opposed the continued Greek campaign in Asia Minor, he resigned and went into retirement on 28 December 1920. He stated the following for the Greek Occupation of Anatolia to Venizelos: &quot;The Greek state is not today ready for the government and exploitation of a so extensive a territory.&quot; He subsequently repeatedly rejected the military leadership of the Greek army offered to him by Constantine. As a soldier, Metaxas argued that Greece did not have logistical capacity nor the economic resources to support an army in the interior of Anatolia, and the decision by his patron, King Constantine, to continue the war against Turkey caused a rift between the two.

Following the defeat of Greek forces in Asia Minor, King Constantine was again forced into exile by the 11 September 1922 Revolution, led by Col. Nikolaos Plastiras. Metaxas moved into politics and founded the Freethinkers&#x27; Party on 12 October 1922.

However, his association with the failed Monarchist Leonardopoulos-Gargalidis coup attempt in October 1923 forced him to flee the country again. Soon after, King George II (son of Constantine I) was also forced into exile. The monarchy was abolished, and the Second Hellenic Republic was proclaimed, in March 1924.

Metaxas returned to Greece soon after, publicly stating his acceptance of the Republic regime. Despite a promising start, and his status as one of the most prominent Monarchist politicians, Metaxas&#x27;s foray into politics was not very successful. In the 1926 elections, his Freethinkers&#x27; Party claimed 15.8% of the vote and 52 seats in Parliament, putting it almost on a par with the other main Monarchist party, the People&#x27;s Party. As a result, Metaxas became Communications Minister in the &quot;ecumenical government&quot; formed under Alexandros Zaimis.

However, infighting within the party and the departure of many members plunged the party to 5.3% and a single seat in the 1928 elections. The 1932 and 1933 elections saw the percentage drop to 1.6%, although the party still returned three MPs, and Metaxas became Interior Minister in the Panagis Tsaldaris cabinet. Metaxas was regarded as the most intransigent and extreme of all the Monarchist politicians and his open hostility to parliamentary government as useless might perhaps explain the relative failure of his parliamentary career. By 1933, even the officially monarchist Populist Party had tacitly came to accept the republic as much as the Liberals as both the Populist and Liberal leaders wanted a system that guaranteed the possibility of orderly change and the rule of law, and Metaxas&#x27;s call for something resembling an absolute monarchy put him out of the mainstream of Greek politics. In 1933, there was a failed assassination attempt against Venizelos, which Metaxas praised in his newspaper &quot;Hellenki&quot;, expressing regret only that the attempt failed. The would-be assassins were never arrested, but Metaxas&#x27;s editorial stance led to widespread suspicions both at the time and since that he was involved, through no definitive evidence has ever emerged.

On 1 March 1935, in Thessaloniki there was an attempted coup d&#x27;état by Venizelist officers ostensibly over the slow pace of the investigation into the attempted assassination, which almost succeeded. Thessaloniki, together with the rest of Greek Macedonia, had taken in the bulk of the about 1.3 million Greeks expelled from Turkey in the compulsory population exchange of 1923, and the majority of the refugees lived in extreme poverty with those living in rural areas making their living picking tobacco.

The collapse of international tobacco prices in the Great Depression lowered living conditions even more and Macedonia was the region of Greece hit worse by the Depression. As it was under the leadership of King Constantine that Greece was defeated in 1922, the refugees tended to be very hostile towards the House of Glücksburg and Thessaloniki was known as a &quot;hotbed of republicanism&quot;.

The failed coup with its connotations of social unrest and protest alarmed the Greek elite and led to a swing towards the right among the elite, though not the Greek people. As a result of the failed coup, the Liberals came to be viewed within the elite as the party of insurgency and chaos while many Populists frightened by the prospect of a revolution swung behind Metaxas&#x27;s viewpoint.

In response to the fears of the impoverished Greek people rising up in a revolution, Metaxas called for a &quot;new order&quot; in Greece, arguing that the Great Depression proved the failure of democracy and authoritarianism was the solution. Under pressure from the newly empowered and more extreme Monarchists like Metaxas, Tsaldaris announced for the first time his intention to hold a referendum on restoring the monarchy.

In the 1935 elections, he cooperated in a union with other small Monarchist parties, returning seven MPs, a performance repeated in the 1936 elections.

Tsaldaris had called early elections in 1935 as a way of putting off the pressure to hold a referendum on restoring the monarchy, and his decisive victory in an election boycotted by the Liberals for the moment seemed to strengthened his hand. In the Peloponnese region, which was the traditional center of Greek royalism, Metaxas&#x27;s party had fared poorly, but he won 20% of the vote in Athens, mostly in middle class and upper-class neighborhoods as the well off looked towards Metaxas as the best man to &quot;impose order&quot; on Greece.

When the War Minister, General Georgios Kondylis, until then a republican and one of the founders of the First Hellenic Republic in 1924, pronounced himself in favor of restoring the monarchy on 3 July 1935, he demoralized the republicans and the more opportunistic republicans started to defect over to the monarchist camp, though Metaxas drew little benefit electorally. Kondylis pronounced himself an admirer of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, and based his call to end the republic he himself had helped to found under the grounds that restoring the monarchy would permanently shift the center of the political gravity in Greece to the right.

Under strong pressure from Kondylis, Tsaldaris finally brought the necessary legislation for a referendum to a vote on the floor of parliament on 10 July 1935. From June to October 1935, there was a crisis atmosphere in Greece as the Army was purged of Venizelist officers, rumors swirled of coups being planned, Metaxas spoke openly of the possibility of a civil war and most politicians were fearful of being caught on the losing side as alliances were rapidly made and unmade. Adding to the crisis atmosphere was a wave of strikes and protests all across the country in both urban and rural areas as the unemployed demanded social reforms that would address the Great Depression. Despite his unpopularity with the Greek people, from August 1935 politicians began to openly visit the former King George II in his exile in London to assure him of their loyalty. On 8 October 1935 and 10 October 1935, the Foreign Minister Dimitros Maximos who was in Geneva attending a session of the League of Nations, telephoned George to tell him that Tsaldaris was preparing a National Council resolution calling for a constitutional monarchy.

In both telephone calls, Maximos asked George to publicly commit himself to obeying the National Council resolution asking him to behave strictly as a constitutional monarch who would uphold democracy and the rule of law. Both times George refused under the grounds that as a king he was above &quot;procedures&quot; and he would rule Greece whatever way he liked. On 10 October 1935, the &quot;Thunder General&quot; as Kondylis was known carried out a coup d&#x27;état in the name of a &quot;revolutionary committee&quot; that deposed Tsaldaris. On 3 November 1935, the monarchy was restored and George returned to Greece to reclaim his crown. The American Embassy in Athens reported that public opinion was firmly against the king, and that it would take a &quot;miracle&quot; for George to keep his throne again as he lacked any popular support.

==Prime Minister and the 4th of August Regime==
After a heavily rigged plebiscite, George II returned to take the throne in 1935. The extent of the voting fraud could be seen in that Crete, the homeland of Venizelos, an island that was well known for its republicanism, showed 50,655 votes for restoring the monarchy and only 1,276 votes for retaining the republic, a figure that was widely regarded at the time as laughable. On 11 December 1935, the king met with Ernst Eisenlohr, the German envoy in Athens, who in his account of the conversation reminded him that Germany was Greece&#x27;s largest trading partner and that: &quot;the fact of a constant active balance in Greece&#x27;s favor arising from the exchange of goods made it possible for Greece to obtain commodities from Germany which she could not purchase from other countries for lack of sufficient supplies of foreign exchange. In discussing economic changes, I endeavored to make clear to the King that Greece could not live without her German customers and that, in particular, a reduction or cessation of our purchases of tobacco must lead to the &quot;impoverishment of the Macedonian peasants and thus to grave disturbances in Greek domestic politics&quot; [emphasis in the original]. Careful fostering of these relationships (between Germany and Greece) was therefore as much a political as an economic imperative.&quot;

To stay in the good graces of the &quot;Reich&quot;, Eisenlohr told the king that he must &quot;bind the armed forces to his person and thus provide himself with a reliable bulwark for his throne in the ever-changing currents of internal politics&quot;; though Eisenlohr did not mention Metaxas by name, it is clear that he was the &quot;reliable bulwark&quot; that he wanted the king to rely upon. At the time, the Romanian foreign minister Nicolae Titulescu was seeking to link the Little Entente of Czechoslovakia, Romania and Yugoslavia together with the Balkan Pact of Yugoslavia, Romania, Greece and Turkey, which Eisenlohr vehemently objected to, saying he wanted the king to appoint as prime minister someone who was friendly towards Germany who would veto Titulescu&#x27;s plan, which was aimed at building an alliance against Germany.

After the elections on 26 January 1936, Venizelists and anti-Venizelists could not form a government mainly on the question of the return of the democratic officers of the 1935 movement to the army. In 1936 elections, the Venizelists won 141 seats while the Populists loyal to Tsaldaris won 72 seats, another faction of the Populists loyal to Ioannis Theotokis won 38 seats, the followers of Kondylis won 12 seats and Metaxas&#x27;s &quot;Eleftherophrones&quot; party won only 7 seats, making Metaxas in electoral terms the weakest of the right-wing leaders. The greatest surprise of the 1936 elections was the breakthrough of the Communist Party of Greece (KKE) which won 15 seats, settling off a hysterical reaction on the right that this presaged a Communist revolution as the fears were voiced that the great masses of the unemployed would rally to the KKE.

In 1935, the Comintern had ordered Communist parties around the world to engage in &quot;popular fronts&quot; against fascism, allying themselves with other left-wing parties. Following the Comintern&#x27;s orders, the KKE declared itself in favor of a &quot;popular front&quot; to unite all left-wing parties against fascism, and called for an alliance with the Venizelists.

Faced with a parliament evenly divided between left and right, the Liberals entered negotiations for Communist support for a Liberal government. The chief of the Army General Staff, General Alexandros Papagos, told the king that the Army would carry out an immediate coup d&#x27;état if the Liberals made an alliance with the KKE, saying he would never allow the Communists to form a government or even have any role in the government.

Contrary to expectations, George had not taken sides in the 1936 election and remained neutral, behaving for once as a constitutional monarch. The king had expected the Liberals to lose, and with the Venizelists forming the largest bloc in Parliament, he faced demands that the Venizelist officers dismissed in 1935 be restated, which led to warnings from the right-wing parties that the king risked being sent into exile again if any of the dismissed officers received their commissions again. There was considerable anger within right-wing circles at the king for &quot;stacking&quot; the election in favor of the Venizelists (i.e. being neutral), and the king was faced with a situation where his loyalist supporters were on the verge of turning against him. Tsaldaris wanted to compromise on the issue of the Venizelist officers, agreeing that some would have their commissions returned, but Theotokis was against any compromise, and thus it was a dispute between Tsaldaris vs. Theotokis as opposed to the dispute between the Venizelists vs. the anti-Venzelists that really paralyzed parliament.

Although Kondylis had been instrumental in restoring the monarchy in 1935, George greatly distrusted him as he had not forgotten that it was Kondylis who had deposed and exiled him in 1924. George had often mused that if he was to play the role of King Victor Emmanuel III, he wanted his Mussolini to be a man who was loyal to the monarchy, which ruled out Kondylis and led the king to turn to Metaxas.

In a series of initiatives, King George II was able to play a decisive role in shaping the political scene. On 5 March, George II appointed Metaxas the Minister of Defense, a post in which he would remain until his death in 1941. The political significance of this appointment was great since Metaxas was not only a dedicated Monarchist but one of the few politicians who had supported openly the imposition of an authoritarian, non-parliamentary regime in Greece.

On 14 March, the Demertzis government was sworn in, and Ioannis Metaxas was appointed vice-president of the government and Minister of Defense. Demertzis died suddenly on 13 April. That same day, the king appointed Metaxas Prime Minister. The very first action of Metaxas was to announce his opposition to Titulescu&#x27;s plan, stating that he was opposed to Greece being allied with any non-Balkan power, which killed Titulescu&#x27;s plan that required the unanimous approval of all Balkan Pact states. Following a failure by the Venizelists to come to an agreement with the anti-Venizelist parties, the Metaxas government secured a vote of confidence from the House of Parliament on 27 April with 241 votes in favor, 4 abstentions and 16 against. Three days later, the House of Parliament resolved and suspended its work for five months, authorizing the government to issue legislative decrees on all matters, with the agreement of a parliamentary committee which never operated. The appointment of Metaxas as prime minister caused a strike wave all across the country with Macedonia being the center of the protests and strikes. On 29 April 1936, the tobacco farmers of Macedonia went on a strike to protest his appointment and on 9 May a general strike began in Thessaloniki.

Widespread industrial unrest gave Metaxas justification to declare a state of emergency on 4 August 1936 with the excuse of the &quot;communist danger&quot;. With the King&#x27;s support, he adjourned parliament indefinitely and suspended various articles of the constitution guaranteeing civil liberties. In a national radio address, Metaxas declared that for the duration of the state of emergency, he would hold &quot;all the power I need for saving Greece from the catastrophes which threaten her.&quot; The regime created as a result of this self-coup became known as the &quot;4th of August Regime&quot; after the date of its proclamation.

The regime&#x27;s propaganda presented Metaxas as &quot;the First Peasant&quot;, &quot;the First Worker&quot; and &quot;the National Father&quot; of the Greeks. Metaxas adopted the title of &quot;Arkhigos&quot;, Greek for &quot;leader&quot; or &quot;chieftain&quot;, and claimed a &quot;Third Hellenic Civilization&quot;, following ancient Greece and the Christian Byzantine Empire of the Middle Ages. State propaganda portrayed Metaxas as a &quot;Saviour of the Nation&quot;, bringing unity to a divided country.

===Internal policies===
Patterning his regime on other authoritarian European governments of the day, Metaxas banned political parties (including his own), prohibited strikes and introduced widespread censorship of the media. National unity was to be achieved by the abolition of the previous political parliamentary system, which was seen as having left the country in chaos (see National Schism). Metaxas disliked the old parties of the political landscape, including traditional conservatives.

Along with anti-parliamentarism, anti-communism formed the second major political agenda of the 4th of August regime. Minister of Security Konstantinos Maniadakis quickly infiltrated and practically dissolved the Communist Party of Greece by seizing its archives and arresting Communist leader Nikos Zachariadis. Metaxas himself became Minister of Education in 1938 and had all school texts re-written to fit the regime&#x27;s ideology.

Suppressing Communism was followed by a campaign against &quot;anti-Greek&quot; literature viewed as dangerous to the national interest. Book burnings targeted authors such as Goethe, Shaw and Freud, and several Greek writers.

Arthur Koestler, who visited Athens in 1938, noted that even Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot; was on Metaxas&#x27;s list of prohibited bookswhich in Koestler&#x27;s view made the Metaxas dictatorship &quot;stupid as well as vicious&quot;. At that time Koestler met secretly with members of the underground opposition, hearing from them &quot;horrifying stories of police brutality, especially the case of unspeakable torture inflicted on a young girl who was communist&quot;.

While to build a corporatist state and secure popular support, Metaxas adopted or adapted many of the modernizing institutions being introduced elsewhere around the world: a National Labor Service, the eight-hour workday, mandatory improvements to working conditions, and the Social Insurance Institute (, IKA), still the biggest social security institution in Greece.

In terms of symbolism, the Roman salute and the Minoan double-axe, the &quot;labrys&quot;, were introduced. Unlike Mussolini, however, Metaxas lacked the support provided by a mass political party; indeed, he deliberately positioned himself as being above politics. The regime&#x27;s only mass organization was the National Organisation of Youth (EON), whose literature and magazines were promoted in schools. Throughout his rule, Metaxas&#x27;s power rested primarily upon the army and the support of King George II.

===Foreign policy and the war with Italy===
It is often mistakenly believed that Metaxas followed a neutral stance in foreign policy by trying to balance between Britain and Germany or that he had a pro-German policy. As recent studies have proven, however, Greece under Metaxas remained a close ally of Britain, and he never intended to adopt a pro Axis policy. Additionally, the foreign policy of the regime was mainly determined by George II of Greece, who had close ties with the British government.

Ever since the Corfu incident of 1923, the Greeks had regarded Italy as the principal enemy, and as long as Italy and Germany were divided by the Austrian Question, Metaxas saw Germany as a counterweight to Italy. The British historian D. C. Watt described Metaxas as living &quot;in a paranoiac world&quot; and as convinced that Britain was seeking his overthrow and seeing plots against him everywhere. The emergence of the &quot;Rome-Berlin Axis&quot; in 1936 greatly upset Metaxas&#x27;s calculations and forced him to reevaluate Greece&#x27;s foreign policy alignments, though he continued to hope for a while that Germany would restrain Italy in the Balkans. In the late 1930s, as with the other Balkan countries, Germany became Greece&#x27;s largest trading partner.

To break the German dominance of the Balkans, the British agreed to launch an &quot;economic offensive&quot; into the Balkans in November 1938, but the question of whether Britain should buy the Greek tobacco crop led to much debate within the British government as objections were made that British smokers, accustomed to Canadian and American tobacco, should not have to smoke Greek tobacco. Metaxas himself had a reputation as a Germanophile dating back to his studies in Germany and his role in the National Schism. The regime&#x27;s literature gave praise to fellow European authoritarian states, especially those of Francisco Franco, Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler. In October 1938, Metaxas asked Michael Palairet, the British minister in Athens, for an alliance out of the hope that the British would turn him down, as they did, which would justify Greek neutrality if another world war should break out.

However, events gradually drove Metaxas to lean toward France and Britain. King George and most of the country&#x27;s elites were staunchly anglophile, and the predominance of the British Royal Navy in the Mediterranean could not be ignored by a maritime country such as Greece. Furthermore, the expansionist goals of Mussolini&#x27;s Italy pushed Greece to lean towards the Franco-British alliance. On 4 April 1939, Italy annexed Albania and Mussolini had committed 20 divisions to occupy Albania, which was far more men than was necessary to occupy a small nation like Albania.

Metaxas became convinced that an Italian invasion of Greece was imminent. On 8 April 1939, Metaxas summoned Palairet for a meeting at midnight to tell him that Greece would fight to the death if Italy invaded, and he asked for British assistance. The fact that Germany had supported Italy&#x27;s annexation of Albania showed Hitler was supporting Italian ambitions in the Balkans, which left Metaxas with no choice but to turn to Britain as a counterweight to Italy. On 13 April 1939, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain speaking in the House of Commons, and French Prime Minister Édouard Daladier speaking in the Chamber of Deputies, announced a joint Anglo-French guarantee of Romania and Greece. On the same day, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, the British ambassador in Turkey, asked the Turks to open staff talks with the Greeks so that they could come to Greece&#x27;s aid in the event of an Italian invasion. Though Greece declared neutrality in September 1939, Metaxas&#x27;s acceptance of the Anglo-French &quot;guarantee&quot; in April 1939 associated Greece with the Allies.

Regarding Turkey, Metaxas continued the policy of friendship and good relations, which had been started by Venizelos. The Italian presence and ambitions in the Aegean Sea left him with no other choice. On the day of Atatürk&#x27;s death, Metaxas addressed a letter and speech of condolence.

Metaxas&#x27;s efforts to keep Greece out of war came undone when Mussolini demanded occupation rights to strategic Greek sites. When Italian Ambassador Emanuele Grazzi visited Metaxas&#x27;s residence and presented these demands on the night of 28 October 1940, Metaxas curtly replied in French (the language of diplomacy), &quot;Alors, c&#x27;est la guerre&quot; (&quot;So it&#x27;s war&quot;). 

A popular story, promoted by Metaxas&#x27;s widow Lela, was he simply told Grazzi &quot;Ochi!&quot;&quot; (&quot;No!&quot;) and the image of Metaxas shouting &quot;ochi!&quot; upon the presentation of the Italian ultimatum made the previously unpopular prime minister into a national hero. The single word &quot;Ochi&quot; and all it symbolizes has become iconic in Greek culture. In Nicosia, Cyprus, there is even an &quot;Ochi Square,&quot; now the site of a popular regular farmer&#x27;s market.

A few hours later, Italy invaded Greece from Albania and started the Greco-Italian War. The next day, Metaxas called for a private press conference. He stated to the journalists to be careful about the news during the war, that the Axis powers could not win the war and that Greece would be on the side of the winners. He said that until then, he followed a policy of neutrality (just like King Constantine during the First World War), but after the Italian attack on Greece, he has to follow the policy of Venizelos.

The Hellenic Army mounted a successful defense and a subsequent counteroffensive which forced the Italians back, occupying large parts of southern Albania, which was usually referred to by the Greeks as &quot;Northern Epirus&quot;. In April 1941, Germany invaded Greece to help Italy.

==Death and legacy==

Metaxas never saw the joint Italian-German invasion of Greece during the Battle of Greece because of his death in Athens on 29 January 1941 from what has been described, variously, as throat cancer or an abscess of the throat or a pharyngeal phlegmon which subsequently led to incurable toxaemia. The Greeks, however, continue to celebrate the Ohi Day on October 28 in memory of his refusal to the Italian Ultimatum on that day in 1940.

He was succeeded by Alexandros Koryzis. After the death of Metaxas, the invading forces had to take into account the fortifications constructed by Metaxas in Northern Greece. These fortifications were constructed along the Bulgarian border and were known as the Metaxas Line. Until the Greek military junta of 1967–1974, Metaxas was honored as a patriot and leader of the war against Italy. During the junta, with the exception of a small number of supporters of his regime (namely the banned &quot;4th of August&quot; organization) and few members of the government, no major projects honoring Metaxas were undertaken. Some busts of Metaxas were put up in small towns and the periphery of Athens, mostly after local initiatives.

An idea of erecting a Metaxas statue in central Athens was not accepted by the government and Georgios Papadopoulos, who preferred to identify with Eleftherios Venizelos instead, inaugurated in Athens a large statue of the latter. In the last years of junta, some minor local officials of the regime, disappointed by the liberalization steps planned by Papadopoulos, erected busts of Metaxas in some towns, in order to upset Papadopoulos. In the meantime, during and shortly after the dictatorship, an imagined ideological connection between the 1967 junta and the Metaxas regime and fascism was constructed, by means of books and works of art, such as the books of Spyros Linardatos on the 4th of August regime (1965 and 1966) and the film &quot;Days of &#x27;36&quot; by Theo Angelopoulos. This concept was adopted by the antidictatorial struggle and had a profound impact on subsequent historical production. A resistance group blew up a bust of Metaxas in a Piraeus suburb in 1972. The concept became mainstream after 1974.

The microhistory of Metaxas&#x27;s statues is examined by Kouki K. and Antoniou D. in a study on the construction of an ideological commonality between Metaxas, the 1967 junta and fascism in modern Greek history.

<doc id="236298" wikidata="Q544927" url="?curid=236298" title="Limbo (programming language)">
<text>Limbo is a programming language for writing distributed systems and is the language used to write applications for the Inferno operating system. It was designed at Bell Labs by Sean Dorward, Phil Winterbottom, and Rob Pike.

The Limbo compiler generates architecture-independent object code which is then interpreted by the Dis virtual machine or compiled just before runtime to improve performance. Therefore all Limbo applications are completely portable across all Inferno platforms.

Limbo&#x27;s approach to concurrency was inspired by Hoare&#x27;s communicating sequential processes (CSP), as implemented and amended in Pike&#x27;s earlier Newsqueak language and Winterbottom&#x27;s Alef.

==Language features==
Limbo supports the following features:
* modular programming
* concurrent programming
* strong type checking at compile and run-time
* interprocess communication over typed channels
* automatic garbage collection
* simple abstract data types

==Virtual machine==
The Dis virtual machine that executes Limbo code is a CISC-like VM, with instructions for arithmetic, control flow, data motion, process creation, synchronizing and communicating between processes, loading modules of code, and support for higher-level data-types: strings, arrays, lists, and communication channels. It uses a hybrid of reference counting and a real-time garbage-collector for cyclic data.

Aspects of the design of Dis were inspired by the AT&amp;T Hobbit microprocessor, as used in the original BeBox.

==Examples==
Limbo uses Ada-style definitions as in:
name := type value;
name0,name1 : type = value;
name2,name3 : type;
name2 = value;
=== Hello world ===

implement Command;

include &quot;sys.m&quot;;
 sys: Sys;

include &quot;draw.m&quot;;

include &quot;sh.m&quot;;

init(nil: ref Draw-&gt;Context, nil: list of string)
 sys = load Sys Sys-&gt;PATH;
 sys-&gt;print(&quot;Hello World!\n&quot;);


== Books ==
The 3rd edition of the Inferno operating system and Limbo programming language are described in the textbook &quot;Inferno Programming with Limbo&quot; (Chichester: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2003), by Phillip Stanley-Marbell. Another textbook &quot;The Inferno Programming Book: An Introduction to Programming for the Inferno Distributed System&quot;, by Martin Atkins, Charles Forsyth, Rob Pike and Howard Trickey, was started, but never released.

<doc id="236299" wikidata="Q6037862" url="?curid=236299" title="Pseudodoxia Epidemica">
<text>Pseudodoxia Epidemica: or, Enquiries into very many received tenents and commonly presumed truths, also known simply as Pseudodoxia Epidemica or Vulgar Errors, is a work by Thomas Browne challenging and refuting the &quot;vulgar&quot; or common errors and superstitions of his age. It first appeared in 1646 and went through five subsequent editions, the last revision occurring in 1672. The work includes evidence of Browne&#x27;s adherence to the Baconian method of empirical observation of nature, and was in the vanguard of work-in-progress scientific journalism during the 17th-century Scientific Revolution. Throughout its pages frequent examples of Browne&#x27;s subtle humour can also be found.

Browne&#x27;s three determinants for obtaining truth were the authority of past scholarly works, the act of reason, and empirical experience. Each of these determinants is employed upon subjects ranging from common folklore to the cosmological. Subjects covered in &quot;Pseudodoxia Epidemica&quot; are arranged in accordance to the time-honoured Renaissance scale of creation; the learned doctor essaying on the nature of error itself (Book 1), continuing with fallacies in the mineral, vegetable (Book 2), and animal (Book 3) kingdoms onto errors concerning Man (Book 4), Art (Book 5), Geography and History (Book 6), and finally Astronomy and the Cosmos (Book 7).

==Popular science==
&quot;Pseudodoxia Epidemica&quot; was a valuable source of information which found itself upon the shelves of many homes in seventeenth century England. Being in the vanguard of the scientific writing, it paved the way for much subsequent popular scientific journalism and began a decline in the belief in mythical creatures. Its science includes many examples of Browne&#x27;s &#x27;at-first-hand&#x27; empiricism as well as early examples of the formulation of scientific hypothesis.

The second of &quot;Pseudodoxia Epidemica&quot;&#x27;s seven books entitled &quot;Tenets concerning Mineral and Vegetable Bodies&quot; includes Browne&#x27;s experiments with static electricity and magnetism—the word &quot;electricity&quot; being one of hundreds of neologisms including &quot;medical&quot;, &quot;pathology&quot;, &quot;hallucination&quot;, &quot;literary&quot;, and &quot;computer&quot; contributed by Browne into the vocabulary of the early Scientific Revolution.

==Editions==
The popularity of &quot;Pseudodoxia&quot; in its day is confirmed by the fact that it went through no fewer than six editions. The first appeared in 1646 during the reign of Charles I and during the English Civil War; four during the interregnum, in 1650, 1658 (two), and 1659; and the final edition in 1672, during the reign of Charles II, and when the Scientific Revolution was well under way. &quot;Pseudodoxia&quot; was subsequently translated and published in French, Dutch, Latin and German throughout the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. The German Christian Cabalist Christian Knorr von Rosenroth translated the book into German in 1680.

==Evaluation by other writers==
Today there is considerable confusion how best to define Sir Thomas Browne&#x27;s scientific methodology, which is described by E. S. Merton thus:
William P. Dunn summarised the ambiguities of Browne&#x27;s scientific view-point thus:

Robert Sencourt succinctly defined Browne&#x27;s relationship to scientific enquiry as &quot;an instance of a scientific reason, lit up by mysticism, in the Church of England&quot;.

The 1651 book &quot;Arcana Microcosmi&quot;, by Alexander Ross, attempted to rebut many of Browne&#x27;s claims.

==Sources==

A detailed edition of &quot;Pseudodoxia Epidemica&quot; in two volumes was published by Oxford University Press in 1986, edited and comprehensively annotated by Robin Robbins.

<doc id="236300" wikidata="Q1068134" url="?curid=236300" title="Morning sickness">
<text>Morning sickness, also called nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP), is a symptom of pregnancy that involves nausea or vomiting. Despite the name, nausea or vomiting can occur at any time during the day. Typically the symptoms occur between the 4th and 16th weeks of pregnancy. About 10% of women still have symptoms after the 20th week of pregnancy. A severe form of the condition is known as hyperemesis gravidarum and results in weight loss.
The cause of morning sickness is unknown but may relate to changing levels of the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin. Some have proposed that morning sickness may be useful from an evolutionary point of view. Diagnosis should only occur after other possible causes have been ruled out. Abdominal pain, fever, or headaches are typically not present in morning sickness.
Morning sickness affects about 70–80% of all pregnant women to some extent. About 60% of women experience vomiting. Hyperemesis gravidarum occurs in about 1.6% of pregnancies. Morning sickness can negatively affect quality of life, result in decreased ability to work while pregnant, and result in health-care expenses. Generally, mild to moderate cases have no effect on the fetus, and most severe cases also have normal outcomes. Some women choose to have an abortion due to the severity of symptoms. Complications such as Wernicke encephalopathy or esophageal rupture may occur, but very rarely.
Taking prenatal vitamins before pregnancy may decrease the risk. Specific treatment other than a bland diet may not be required for mild cases. If treatment is used the combination of doxylamine and pyridoxine is recommended initially. There is limited evidence that ginger may be useful. For severe cases that have not improved with other measures methylprednisolone may be tried. Tube feeding may be required in women who are losing weight.

==Signs and symptoms==
About 66% of women have both nausea and vomiting while 33% have just nausea. Symptoms of both nausea and vomiting will normally climax around 10 and 16 weeks of pregnancy, subsiding around 20 weeks. However, after around 22 weeks, up to 10% of women continue to have lingering symptoms.

==Cause==

The cause of morning sickness is unknown but may relate to changing levels of estrogen and the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin. Some have proposed that morning sickness may be useful from an evolutionary point of view -it may protect both the pregnant woman and the developing embryo just when the fetus is most vulnerable. Diagnosis should only occur after other possible causes have been ruled out. Abdominal pain, fever, or headaches are typically not present in morning sickness.

Nausea and vomiting may also occur with molar pregnancy.

Morning sickness is related to diets low in cereals and high in sugars, oilcrops, alcohol and meat.

==Pathophysiology==

===Hormone changes===

* An increase in the circulating level of the hormone estrogen. However, there is no consistent evidence of differences in estrogen levels and levels of bilirubin between women that experience sickness and those that do not. Related to increased estrogen levels, a similar form of nausea is also seen in some women who use hormonal contraception or hormone replacement therapy, but does not predict future reactions to pregnancy.
* An increase in progesterone relaxes the muscles in the uterus, which prevents early childbirth, but may also relax the stomach and intestines, leading to excess stomach acids and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
* An increase in human chorionic gonadotropin. It is probably not the HCG itself that causes the nausea. More likely, it is the HCG stimulating the maternal ovaries to secrete estrogen, which in turn causes the nausea.

===Defense mechanism===
Morning sickness may be an evolved trait that protects the fetus against toxins ingested by the mother. Biologist Margie Profet believes that nausea and food aversions during pregnancy evolved to impose dietary restrictions on the mother in the early weeks of pregnancy, when the mother and the embryo are most immunologically vulnerable, to minimize fetal exposure to toxins such as mutagens and teratogens. By reducing exposure to such chemicals, morning sickness reduces impairments on normal embryonic development and increases the reproductive success of the mother and survival success of both the mother and her offspring. Evidence in support of this theory includes:
* Morning sickness is very common among pregnant women, which argues in favor of its being a functional adaptation and against the idea that it is a pathology.
* Fetal vulnerability to toxins peaks at around 3 months, which is also the time of peak susceptibility to morning sickness.
* There is a good correlation between toxin concentrations in foods, and the tastes and odors that cause revulsion.

Women who have &quot;no&quot; morning sickness are more likely to miscarry. This may be because such women are more likely to ingest substances that are harmful to the fetus.

In addition to protecting the fetus, morning sickness may also protect the mother. A pregnant woman&#x27;s immune system is suppressed during pregnancy, presumably to reduce the chances of rejecting tissues of her own offspring. Because of this, animal products containing parasites and harmful bacteria can be especially dangerous to pregnant women. There is evidence that morning sickness is often triggered by animal products including meat and fish.

If morning sickness is a defense mechanism against the ingestion of toxins, the prescribing of anti-nausea medication to pregnant women may have the undesired side effect of causing birth defects or miscarriages by encouraging harmful dietary choices.

Also, morning sickness is a defense mechanism because when analyzing embryonic growth, several critical periods are identified in which there is mass proliferation and cell division resulting in the development of the heart and central nervous system that are very sensitive. In that period, the fetus is most at risk from damage to toxins and mutagens. These developments occur through week 6-18 which is in the same time frame in which the most nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) occurs. This relationship between the time at which the embryo is most susceptible to toxins lines up exactly with when the most severe NVP symptoms are seen, suggesting that this NVP is an evolutionary response developed in the mother, to indicate the sensitivity of the fetus hence making her wary to her health and in turn protecting the fetus.

==Treatments==
There is a lack of good evidence to support the use of any particular intervention for morning sickness.

===Medications===
A number of antiemetics are effective and safe in pregnancy including: pyridoxine/doxylamine, antihistamines (such as diphenhydramine), metoclopramide, and phenothiazines (such as promethazine). With respect to effectiveness it is unknown if one is superior to another. In the United States and Canada, the doxylamine-pyridoxine combination (as Diclegis in US and Diclectin in Canada) is the only approved pregnancy category &quot;A&quot; prescription treatment for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy.

Ondansetron may be beneficial, but there are some concerns regarding an association with cleft palate, and there is little high quality data. Metoclopramide is also used and relatively well tolerated. Evidence for the use of corticosteroids is weak.

===Alternative medicine===
A recent review of studies has found acupuncture to be safe and effective for NVP. Acupressure applied at the acupuncture point PC6 with finger pressure or a nausea band has some evidence of effectiveness, as does auricular (ear acupuncture).

Some studies support the use of ginger, but overall the evidence is limited and inconsistent. Safety concerns have been raised regarding its anticoagulant properties.

==History==
===Thalidomide===

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the use of thalidomide in 46 countries by women who were pregnant or who subsequently became pregnant resulted in the &quot;biggest man‐made medical disaster ever,&quot; with more than 10,000 children born with a range of severe deformities, such as phocomelia, as well as thousands of miscarriages.

Thalidomide was introduced in 1953 as a tranquilizer, and was later marketed by the German pharmaceutical company Chemie Grünenthal under the trade name Contergan as a medication for anxiety, trouble sleeping, &quot;tension&quot;, and morning sickness. It was introduced as a sedative and medication for morning sickness without having been tested on pregnant women. While initially deemed to be safe in pregnancy, concerns regarding birth defects were noted in 1961, and the medication was removed from the market in Europe that year.

<doc id="236301" wikidata="Q2721925" url="?curid=236301" title="Riley Finn">
<text>Riley Finn is a fictional character created by Joss Whedon for the television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. Portrayed by Marc Blucas, Riley was introduced in the 1999 season 4 premiere episode, &quot;The Freshman&quot;, and Blucas was part of the series credited cast for the second part of season 4 and the first part of season 5. Most notably, Riley is one of three long-term romantic interests for series&#x27; heroine Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar).

Whedon intended Riley to be the antithesis of Buffy&#x27;s boyfriend of the past three seasons, Angel (David Boreanaz), who now headed his own spin-off show. In stark contrast to broody, often pensive Angel, Riley is optimistic, trustworthy and reliable, and in theory presents Buffy with her first opportunity for a &quot;normal&quot; romantic relationship. However, Riley also leads a double life: he is both teaching assistant at UC Sunnydale and a member of The Initiative, a government-sponsored special operations team which both researches and combats the demons which roam Sunnydale. This allows him to interact with Buffy both in her civilian life and assist her with her duties as a Slayer; while Buffy has supernatural powers associated with her role, Riley must rely instead on his extensive military training.

In the show&#x27;s fifth season, writers experimented with making Riley a more complex character, and so depicted Riley beginning to &quot;fray around the edges&quot;. This storyline culminated in Riley being written out of the series in 2000. In 2002, Blucas returned for a final televised appearance in the show&#x27;s sixth season, where he is seen to have moved on from Buffy and married. Subsequently, the character appears in Expanded Universe material such as the canonical comic book continuation to the series, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight&quot; (2007–11). In &quot;Season Eight&quot;, the precise nature of Riley&#x27;s role in the storyline is unclear for much of the story; writer Jane Espenson, however, wrote a &quot;Riley&quot; one-shot comic book focusing on Riley and his wife.

==Character history==
A native of Huxley, Iowa, Riley is Buffy Summers&#x27; boyfriend for parts of seasons four and five. He is first introduced as Professor Walsh&#x27;s TA in a psych class Buffy and Willow are in. Riley realizes his feelings for Buffy after punching Parker Abrahams for an inappropriate comment Parker makes regarding their night together. Even though he leads a double life as part of a secret government organization known as The Initiative, Buffy finds some normalcy in Riley as a regular college guy and someone to whom she could relate. Initially, each keeps the other from knowing their respective secret lives, but the truth comes out during the events in the Emmy-nominated episode &quot;Hush&quot;.

Buffy and Riley fight demons together and continue saving each other&#x27;s lives and the world, although Riley is never quite let into Buffy&#x27;s inner circle. Initially, Riley automatically assumes that all demons are evil, but discovers that demons are capable of both good and evil just as humans are after assisting in saving Oz from the Initiative complex. Having been torn between the Scooby Gang and the Initiative for some time, Riley decides to leave the Initiative upon discovering the extent of its corruption, and spends the remainder of the season in hiding within the ruins of Sunnydale High.

The Initiative was destroyed at the end of season 4, and Riley is relieved of his military standing. He is left at loose ends, and his behavior becomes reckless. Over time, Riley begins to see himself as below Buffy in strength, and begins to push his body well past its limits. In &quot;Out of My Mind&quot;, it is discovered that the drugs that Professor Walsh had secretly fed him are causing Riley&#x27;s pain receptors to shut down and his heartbeat to spike, and could eventually have killed him. Even with this knowledge, Riley initially refuses to accept medical treatment from the government out of paranoia, though Buffy eventually convinces him to do so. Rendered a normal human by the procedure, Riley&#x27;s insecurities and feelings of weakness only increase, and he becomes increasingly frustrated with Buffy&#x27;s seeming inability to open up to and be honest with him.

Seeking thrills, and wondering what Buffy seems to find so appealing about vampires – Buffy having allowed both Angel and Dracula to drink from her – Riley begins to let vampires feed from him, which Buffy discovers in the episode &quot;Into the Woods&quot; when Spike reveals Riley at the vampire&#x27;s nest. His behavior, as well as Spike&#x27;s manipulations and a sense that Buffy would never truly love him, lead to their breakup. Riley leaves Sunnydale to join another black ops army unit fighting demons elsewhere.

Riley returns in the season 6 episode &quot;As You Were&quot;, in which he shows up unexpectedly with his new wife, fellow demon hunter Sam (Ivana Miličević), tracking a demon about to hatch eggs that could wipe out Sunnydale. When Riley learns that Buffy has been sleeping with Spike, he consoles her on her struggles with her life, and forgives her after she apologizes for what happened between them. The battle done, Riley leaves Sunnydale, never to return again. He is, however, mentioned in the season 7 episode &quot;The Killer in Me&quot; where Buffy attempts to contact him for advice on the malfunctioning chip in Spike&#x27;s head. Riley then contacts soldiers from the Initiative, who help diagnose Spike&#x27;s condition and then discuss with Buffy that per Riley&#x27;s instruction, it is her decision to remove or repair the chip in order to save Spike&#x27;s life. Buffy has them remove the chip.

In canonical comic book continuation &quot;Season Eight&quot; issue &quot;Time of Your Life, Part IV&quot;, it is revealed that Riley is one of villain Twilight&#x27;s followers, as he is present in the laboratory with Warren Mears, Amy Madison, and Twilight, and bears his mark. Samantha Finn did not appear in Season Eight. Pretending to be Buffy&#x27;s &quot;inside man&quot;, he arranged for their rendezvous in New York City. Later, seen in &quot;Retreat, Part II&quot;, Riley is with Twilight and his other followers as they try and track the Scooby Gang through their use of magic; Riley tries to convince Twilight that the results could be a mistake of the scanning technology. He is also intrigued by Twilight&#x27;s remark that he &quot;knows&quot; Buffy. During a large battle between the Slayers and Twilight&#x27;s forces, Buffy recovers an injured Riley, revealing to the other characters that Riley was a double agent for her in an attempt to figure out Twilight&#x27;s plans and identity.

Riley also appears in the first issue of the follow-up series &quot;Season Nine&quot; (2011–2013); the structure of &quot;Freefall, Part I&quot; suggests that Riley—like Spike, Xander, Willow and others—could have been Buffy&#x27;s possible one-night stand after the party she hosts at her apartment in San Francisco. Riley remains married to Sam. With the end of magic, Riley now uses his military resources to watch for ordinary terrorists. It is later revealed in &quot;Apart (of Me)&quot; that Buffy did not have sex with anyone. Riley does not appear for the rest of the season. Concurrent with &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Ten&quot;, in &quot;Angel &amp; Faith&quot; #4 (2014), Faith attempts to leave San Francisco but is contacted by her boss, the Slayer Kennedy, with a mission to find Riley, who has been reported missing in a South American jungle. In the next arc &quot;Lost &amp; Found&quot; Faith finds both Sam and Riley. Riley is willing to forgive her after she saved his life from the tribal vampires in the jungle and says she should stop focusing on seeking forgiveness to make herself feel better and just be the kind of person who would not do those things anymore. He also suggests she talk over the past with Buffy.

==Writing and acting==
Marc Blucas was asked how the character was described to him during the audition process, he replied that &quot;They said that Riley is a nice, charming guy, and there&#x27;s going to be some kind of dichotomy, some kind of double role going on. But that was never really specified.&quot; In contrast to both Angel and Spike, Riley held out the possibility of normality in Buffy&#x27;s life. He is also notable in that he is the only boyfriend of Buffy who was accepted by and developed a friendship with Xander Harris, who usually displayed jealousy of the males in her life.

Whedon defended the character of Riley Finn, &quot;The important thing for us was to find a character that was the anti-Angel and to have Buffy go through something very different, part of which was the question, &#x27;How do I get over Angel?&#x27; That was the same thing the audience was going through. We knew it wasn&#x27;t going to be easy and it was very hard trying to find somebody. But Marc [Blucas] has a quality that I love very much: he has sort of an un-David-like, firm, strong, trustworthy quality. I always think of him as Gary Cooper.&quot; During season 5, writer/co-executive producer, Marti Noxon, noted that they were making Riley a more tortured complex character, &quot;He&#x27;s starting to fray around the edges. That&#x27;s very compelling to me – that this straight guy is starting to get a little strange.&quot;

Actor Christian Kane also auditioned for Riley Finn. Kane went on to play the role of Lindsey McDonald on the spin-off show &quot;Angel&quot;. Kane says he played his audition for Riley &quot;perhaps a little less than wholesome&quot;, which he feels resulted in Joss Whedon later casting him as a darker character.

<doc id="236303" wikidata="Q1771741" url="?curid=236303" title="Religio Medici">
<text>Religio Medici (The Religion of a Doctor) by Sir Thomas Browne is a spiritual testament and early psychological self-portrait. Browne mulls over the relation between his medical profession and his Christian faith. Published in 1643 after an unauthorised version was distributed the previous year, it became a European best-seller which brought its author fame at home and abroad. It likely contains the first known English language reference to Zoroastrianism.It was translated into Latin,French,German,Dutch and Italian and was reprinted about eight times during the author&#x27;s life-time. It speaks on the themes of the religion of a doctor arguing that doctors are not atheists and that religion is not incompatible with science.

== Themes ==

=== Religion ===
Structured upon the Christian virtues of Faith and Hope (part 1) and Charity (part 2), Browne expresses his beliefs in the doctrine of &quot;sola fide&quot;, the existence of hell, the &quot;Last Judgment&quot;, the resurrection and other tenets of Christianity.

=== Science and religion ===
Throughout &quot;Religio Medici&quot; Browne uses scientific imagery to illustrate religious truths as part of his discussion on the relationship of science to religion.

==Reception and influence==
A rare surviving contemporary review by Guy Patin, a distinguished member of the Parisian medical faculty, indicates the considerable impact &quot;Religio Medici&quot; had upon the intelligentsia abroad: 

Throughout the seventeenth century &quot;Religio Medici&quot; spawned numerous imitative titles, including John Dryden&#x27;s great poem, Religio Laici, but none matched the frank, intimate tone of the original in which Browne shares his thoughts, as well as the idiosyncrasies of his personality with his reader.

Samuel Pepys in his Diary transcribed William Petty&#x27;s opinion that the &quot;Religio&quot; was &quot;cried up to the whole world for its wit and learning&quot; but &quot;the wit lie in confirming some pretty sayings, which are generally like paradoxes, by some argument smartly and pleasantly argued&quot;&quot;.&quot; 

A translation into German of the &quot;Religio&quot; was made in 1746 and an early admirer of Browne&#x27;s spiritual testament was Goethe&#x27;s one-time associate Lavater.

In the early nineteenth century &quot;Religio Medici&quot; was &quot;re-discovered&quot; by the English Romantics. Charles Lamb introduced it to Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who after reading it, exclaimed,-

&quot;O to write a character of this man!&quot;

Thomas de Quincey in his &quot;Confessions of an English Opium-Eater&quot; also praised it, stating: 

The book strongly influenced the prominent physician William Osler in his early years. Osler, who is considered the &quot;father of modern medicine&quot;, is said to have learned it by heart.

In Virginia Woolf&#x27;s opinion &quot;Religio Medici&quot; paved the way for all future confessionals, private memoirs and personal writings.

In the twentieth century, the Swiss psychologist Carl Jung used the term &quot;Religio Medici&quot; several times in his writings.

==Literary allusions==
Dorothy L. Sayers in her novel &quot;Gaudy Night&quot; has Harriet Vane discover that Peter Wimsey is reading &quot;Religio Medici&quot;. It helps her better understand his character and motivations.

Patricia Highsmith&#x27;s novel &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; references a Morocco-bound copy of the work, and Guy reflects on his favorite passages.

In &quot;Excellent Women&quot; by Barbara Pym, the sad, spinsterish church-lady Mildred Lathbury has a copy on her bedside table.

<text>Piggy bank (sometimes penny bank or money box) is the traditional name of a coin container normally used by children. The piggy bank is known to collectors as a &quot;still bank&quot; as opposed to the &quot;mechanical banks&quot; popular in the early 20th century. These items are also often used by companies for promotional purposes, and many financial service companies use piggy banks as logos for their savings products.

Piggy banks are usually made of ceramic or porcelain. They are generally painted and serve as a pedagogical device to teach the rudiments of thrift and saving to children; money can be easily inserted. Many piggy banks have a rubber plug located on the underside; others are made of vinyl and have a removable nose for easy coin access. Some incorporate electronic systems that calculate the amount of money deposited. Some piggy banks do not have an opening besides the slot for inserting coins, which will lead to smashing the piggy bank with a hammer or by other means, to obtain the money within.

==Origins==

The oldest Western find of a money box dates from the 2nd century BC Greek colony Priene, Asia Minor, and features the shape of a miniature Greek temple with a slit in the pediment. Money boxes of various forms were also excavated in Pompeii and Herculaneum, and appear quite frequently on late ancient provincial sites, particularly in Roman Britain and along the Rhine.

===Pig-shaped money box===

The earliest known pig-shaped money containers date to the 12th century on the island of Java. The Javanese term &quot;cèlèngan&quot; (ꦕꦺꦭꦺꦁꦔꦤ꧀; literally &quot;likeness of a wild boar&quot;, but used to mean both &quot;savings&quot; and &quot;piggy bank&quot;) is also in the modern Indonesian language. 

A large number of boar-shaped piggy banks were discovered at the large archaeological site surrounding Trowulan, a village in the Indonesian province of East Java and a possible site of the capital of the Majapahit Empire.

There are some folk etymologies regarding the English language term &quot;piggy bank,&quot; but in fact, there is no clear origin for the phrase. The earliest citation in the Oxford English Dictionary is from 1913, and from 1902 for the variant &quot;pig bank&quot;. It is believed that the popularity of the Western piggy banks originates in Germany, where pigs were revered as symbols of good fortune. The oldest German piggy bank dates to the 13th century and was recovered during construction work in Thuringia. The earliest known uses of &quot;pig bank&quot; are in newspaper articles from 1900. In Mexico, piggy banks are called &quot;alcancía&quot;, a term originating from Andalusian Arabic.

==Uses ==
The general use of piggy banks is to store loose change in a quaint, decorative manner. Modern piggy banks are not limited to the likeness of pigs and may come in a range of shapes, sizes, and colors. They are most commonly used by temples and churches because they are locked money boxes with narrow openings to drop cash or coins. The box is opened via a plug underneath it at regular intervals when the collected money is counted and recorded.

<doc id="236306" wikidata="Q660330" url="?curid=236306" title="TAR syndrome">
<text>TAR syndrome (thrombocytopenia with absent radius) is a rare genetic disorder that is characterized by the absence of the radius bone in the forearm and a dramatically reduced platelet count. It is associated with cardiac defects, dysmorphic features, and petechiae. It involves a 1q21 deletion with RMB8A variant on other allele. 

==Signs and symptoms==
* Presents with symptoms of thrombocytopenia, or a lowered platelet count, leading to bruising and potentially life-threatening hemorrhage.
* Absence of the radius bone in the forearm with preservation of the thumb.

Other common links between people with TAR syndrome include anemia, heart problems, kidney problems, knee joint problems, and frequently milk allergy. Different cases with leukemia in patients with TAR are described in.

==Genetics==

This condition requires mutations in both chromosomes. The first mutation is inheritance of a 1q21.1 deletion and the second is in the remaining in the RBM8A gene.

Approximately 95% of TAR patients have one non-functional copy of the RBM8A gene.

==Treatment==
Treatments range from platelet transfusions to surgery aimed at either centralizing the hand over the ulna to improve functionality of the hand or aimed at &#x27;normalizing&#x27; the appearance of the arm, which is much shorter and &#x27;clubbed&#x27;. There is some controversy surrounding the role of surgery. The infant mortality rate has been curbed by new technology, including platelet transfusions, which can even be performed in utero. The critical period is the first and sometimes second year of life. For most people with TAR, platelet counts improve as they grow out of childhood.

==Epidemiology==
The incidence is 0.42 per 100,000 live births.

== History ==
In 1929 Greenwald and Sherman{{ described the first patient with TAR Syndrome. 40 years later Hall collected 40 cases and introduced the name &quot;Thrombocytopenia with absent radius&quot;. In 1988 Hedberg published an article with 100 cases.

<text>George Silver (ca. 1550s–1620s) was a gentleman of England during the late 16th and early 17th centuries, who is known for his writings on swordplay. He is thought to have been the eldest of four brothers (one of whom, Toby, was also a swordsman who accompanied his brother in at least one challenge), and eleventh in descent from Sir Bartholomew Silver, who was knighted by Edward II. He married a woman named Mary Haydon in London, in 1580 (1579 in the old calendar then in use in England). Silver&#x27;s activities after the publication of his book are unclear. The fencing historian Aylward claims that he was alive in 1622, when he was visited (a kind of audit of people claiming noble or gentlemanly status) by Cooke, Clarenceux King-of-Arms. However, Robert Cooke died in 1593. The Clarenceux King-of Arms in 1622 was William Camden, but as he became paralyzed in 1622 and died in 1623 it is doubtful whether he visited Silver either.

== Fencing ==
As a gentleman, Silver was not a professional fencing teacher (a role mostly played by members of the fencing teachers&#x27; guild, the London-based Corporation of Maisters of the Noble Science of Defence), but he was familiar with the fencing schools of the time, and the systems of defence that they taught, and claimed to have achieved a perfect understanding of the use of all weapons. Silver championed the native English martial arts while objecting on ethical and technical grounds to the fashionable continental rapier systems being taught at the time. He particularly disliked the immigrant Italian fencing masters Rocco Bonetti and Vincentio Saviolo, going so far as to challenge the latter to a public fencing match with various weapons atop a scaffold. Silver and his brother Toby had handbills posted all around Saviolo&#x27;s fencing school and had one hand delivered to him on the day but Saviolo failed to appear.

His major objections to the rapier itself and to its pedagogy were expressed in his 1599 work, &quot;Paradoxes of Defence&quot;. Silver saw the rapier as an incredibly dangerous weapon, which did not offer the user sufficient protection during a fight. Silver also bemoans other weapons that do not offer sufficient protection to the user (such as daggers); the rapier, however, bears the brunt of his attention, as it was seemingly quite common in the day. Despite his dislike of the weapon, Silver did claim some familiarity with the rapier, listing it first in the weapons he proposed to use in his challenge to Saviolo.

He later wrote his &quot;Bref Instructions on my Paradoxes of Defence&quot; in which he explained some of his method for using his preferred weapons (he recommends the shorter backsword as being more versatile and offering better defence than the rapier). The manuscript is undated but refers to the &quot;nation of Great Britain&quot; and so must have been written after James I&#x27;s introduction of that term in late 1604. &quot;Bref Instructions&quot;, however, remained an unpublished manuscript until its publication in 1898 by fencing historian Captain Cyril G. R. Matthey as a training manual to aid soldiers fighting in the Boer War.

Silver recommends a highly dynamic system which he deemed suitable for duelling, street defence and the battlefield, rather than the purely duelling orientation of the rapier.

A major difference between Silver&#x27;s system and Italian rapier fencing lies in his not advocating the use of the lunge but rather the use of a gathering step, the normal fencing step in which the feet do not pass, or a full passing step in which they do, to come into range to strike the opponent, followed by instantly &quot;flying out&quot; again. He does not provide specific instructions for the placing of the feet relative to each other or regarding what angle from each other they are placed at, although one illustration in &quot;Paradoxes of Defence&quot; shows a man measuring the length of his sword standing with his back foot out at a 90-degree angle from his imagined opponent.

One point of similarity with Italian rapier fencing is that Silver advocates the use of the thrust together with the cut; he claims that in the English tradition thrusts were forbidden at sword, while cuts were forbidden with rapiers. He deems this prohibition of thrusting an &quot;evill order or custome&quot; and believes that &quot;there is no fight perfect without both blow and thrust&quot;.

<text>William Livingston (November 30, 1723July 25, 1790) was an American politician and lawyer who served as the first governor of New Jersey (1776–1790) during the American Revolutionary War. As a New Jersey representative in the Continental Congress, he signed the Continental Association and the United States Constitution. He is one of the Founding Fathers of the United States and a founding father of New Jersey.

==Early life and education==

Livingston was born in Albany in the Province of New York on November 30, 1723. He was the son of Philip Livingston (1686–1749), the 2nd Lord of Livingston Manor, and Catherine Van Brugh, the only child of Albany mayor Pieter Van Brugh. His older siblings included Robert Livingston (1708–1790), 3rd Lord of Livingston Manor, Peter Van Brugh Livingston (1710–1792), New York State Treasurer, and Philip Livingston (1716–1778), a member of the New York State Senate.

Livingston received his early education from local schools and tutors. At age 13, he was sent to live for a year and prepare for college with the Anglican missionary catechist and Yale College graduate Henry Barclay who lived among the Iroquois in the Mohawk Valley at Fort Hunter. Livingston enrolled at Yale in 1737 and graduated in 1741. He went on to New York City, where he studied law and became a law clerk for the eminent lawyer James Alexander. He left Alexander&#x27;s office in the spring of 1746 before finishing his apprenticeship because of a disagreement and joined the office of William Smith Sr.

==Career in New York==
He became a lawyer in 1748 and began his practice in New York City. In 1752, he founded a weekly journal, the &quot;Independent Reflector&quot;, along with fellow Presbyterian lawyers William Smith Jr., the son of his law teacher, and John Morin Scott. The three were called by contemporaries &quot;The Triumvirate&quot;. The &quot;Reflector&quot; was New York&#x27;s first serial non-newspaper publication and the only one being published in British North America at the time. It was used as a platform by the political upstate Presbyterian land-owning &quot;country faction&quot; led by Livingston for challenging the powerful downstate Anglican and Dutch Reformed merchant or &quot;popular faction&quot; led by Chief Justice James De Lancey. Most notably, the Triumvirate attacked the founding of King&#x27;s College (later renamed as Columbia University) as a conspiracy by Anglicans to install a bishop in America, including his former tutor Rev. Henry Barclay, rector of Trinity Church, and his former law teacher James Alexander.

Publication of the &quot;Reflector&quot; ceased with the fifty-second issue in late 1753 after political pressure was brought to bear upon its printer, James Parker, but Livingston and his allies continued to attack the college over the next year with columns in newspapers. By raising divisive issues, he managed to divert half the funds raised by a state lottery for the college to fund the construction of a new jail and a detention house for sailors from diseased ships. In July 1754, King&#x27;s College was defiantly opened under its first president, Samuel Johnson, and on October 31, 1754, King George III granted a charter to the institution. Ultimately, King&#x27;s College never appointed a bishop, despite its backing by the Anglican Church.

Livingston remained politically active and was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1768 and served one term in the New York General Assembly until his political allies lost power in 1769 and was replaced by his nephew, Peter Robert Livingston, the eldest surviving son of his brother Robert.

==Career in New Jersey==

In 1772, he moved to Elizabethtown in the colonial-era Province of New Jersey, where he rented a house in town. A young Alexander Hamilton lived with Livingston for at least the winter while he attended Francis Barber&#x27;s grammar school.

Livingston started construction of a large country home to house his growing family. The house, known as Liberty Hall, still stands. After attaining considerable influence among the local patriots, Livingston was elected to serve as one of New Jersey&#x27;s delegates to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia, where he served from July 1774 to June 1776. New Jersey&#x27;s Provincial Congress declined to reappoint him to the Second Continental Congress, however, since he did not favor immediate independence, so he was not a signatory to the Declaration of Independence that was unanimously adopted on July 4, 1776. William Livingston&#x27;s older brother, Philip Livingston, who remained as a strong member of the New York delegation, did become one of the 56 signers.

Meanwhile, the New Jersey Provincial Congress offered William Livingston command of its state&#x27;s militia, which he declined. When William Livingston returned to New Jersey from Philadelphia in the summer of 1776, he relied on his October 1775 commission as a brigadier general of the New Jersey Militia.

In August 1776, he was elected Governor of New Jersey. Between 1776 and 1779, the family lived in Parsippany at the Bowers–Livingston–Osborn House for safety from local Loyalists. Liberty Hall was frequently visited by British forces since there was a substantial reward for Livingston&#x27;s capture. One attempt to kidnap him took place in mid-June 1779. False information about Livingston visiting his second home in Parsippany resulted in a raid by Loyalists and their subsequent capture. The Loyalist mayor of New York City, and a distant cousin through the Schuyler family, David Mathews, was suspected by being behind the attempted capture of Livingston. The family returned to Liberty Hall in 1779 to begin restoring their looted home. He was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1782.

===Later years===
Livingston joined the New Jersey Delegation to the 1787 Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia and was one of the signers of the U.S. Constitution. He was appointed United States Minister to the Netherlands in 1788 by the U.S. Congress, but turned down the opportunity. He continued to be reelected governor of New Jersey each year until his death in 1790.

==Personal life==

Livingston married Susannah French (1723–1789) in New Jersey in 1745. She was the daughter of landowner Philip French III and Susanna (née Brockholst) French. Her paternal grandparents were Phillip French, the 27th mayor of New York City, and Annetje (née Philipse) French (the daughter of Frederick Philipse). Her maternal grandparents were Susanna Maria Brockholst and Anthony Brockholst, an acting governor of colonial New York under Sir Edmund Andros. They had 13 children, including:

* Livingston (1746–1746), a son who died in infancy.
* Livingston (1747–1747), a son who died in infancy.
* Susannah Livingston (1748–1840), who married John Cleves Symmes (1742–1814) in 1780 and became the stepmother-in-law of President William Henry Harrison.
* Catherine Livingston (1751–1813), who married Matthew Ridley (1746–1789), and later, her cousin John Livingston (1750–1822), son of Robert Livingston.
* Mary Livingston (born 1753), who married James Linn in May 1771.
* William Livingston Jr. (1754–1817), who married Mary Lennington.
* Philip Van Brugh Livingston (born 1755), who died unmarried.
* Sarah Van Brugh Livingston (1756–1802), who married John Jay (1745–1829).
* Henry Brockholst Livingston (1757–1823), an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States who married 3 times.
* Judith Livingston (1758–1843), who married John W. Watkins, an attorney.
* Philip French Livingston (born 1760), who drowned in the Hackensack River.
* John Lawrence Livingston (1762–1781), who died at sea aboard the .
* Elizabeth Clarkson Livingston (1764–1765), who died young.

===Descendants===
Livingston&#x27;s daughter, Sarah, was born in 1756 and was educated at home in penmanship, English grammar, the Bible, and classic literature. At a time when women were usually relegated to the kitchen, she was brought up to be politically aware, even serving at times as her father&#x27;s secretary. Sarah, at the age of 17, married John Jay. Sarah accompanied Jay to Spain and then Paris, where he, along with John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, and Henry Laurens, negotiated the Treaty of Paris in 1783. She is credited with writing the celebratory Treaty of Paris dinner toast. When Sarah and John returned to New York, Jay was appointed Secretary of Foreign Affairs, and her Parisian training came in handy, as she and her husband established the custom of weekly dinners for the diplomatic corps and other guests in the then-capital city of New York City. Sarah served in her hospitality role as the wife of the first Chief Justice of the United States and First Lady of New York.

Among the other prominent descendants of William Livingston were Julia Kean, wife of United States Secretary of State and New York Governor Hamilton Fish, a descendant of Peter Stuyvesant, the last Dutch Director-General of New Amsterdam; Thomas Kean, the 48th Governor of New Jersey and the grand-nephew of Hamilton Fish; Edwin Brockholst Livingston, a historian; and Henry Brockholst Ledyard, mayor of Detroit.

===Death and legacy===
Livingston died on July 25, 1790, in Elizabeth, New Jersey, and was originally buried at Trinity Church in Manhattan, but on May 7, 1844, was reinterred at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn.

In 1747, Livingston wrote and published a long pastoral poem entitled, &quot;Philosophic Solitude, or the Choice of a Rural Life&quot;. One of the first successful original poems written by an American colonist, it was anthologized numerous times into the 19th century. In 1754, Livingston also played a key role in founding the New York Society Library, which is still in existence over a quarter of a millennium later. Livingston also authored a commentary upon the government of England in comparison to the United States Constitution, titled &#x27;Examen du Gouvernement
d’Angleterre comparé aux Constitutions des Etats-Unis&#x27;, which was cited approvingly by Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès in his pamphlet &#x27;What Is the Third Estate?&#x27;.

Livingston, New Jersey in Essex County, New Jersey, Governor Livingston High School in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, and the Livingston campus at Rutgers University were each named in his honor.

<text> () was a common name for the fitting of an upward-firing autocannon or machine gun, to an interceptor aircraft, such as a night fighter. The term was introduced by the German during World War II. was previously a German colloquialism, meaning music that featured an unusual tuning and/or time signature (e.g., jazz). The standard usage of the adjective is often translated as &quot;slanting&quot; or &quot;oblique&quot;, but its slang usage is often translated as &quot;weird&quot; or &quot;strange&quot;.

The first such systems were developed (though not widely employed) in World War I as anti-Zeppelin defenses by the French and British, in an era when fighters struggled to match the altitude capacity of the German airships and were forced to devise means to attack from below. The later resurrection of the concept by the Germans was inspired by observed weaknesses in the standard British night bomber aircraft of the WW2 era (the Avro Lancaster and Handley Page Halifax), which lacked ventral ball turrets in order to save weight, making them vulnerable to covert approaches and attacks from below under the cover of darkness. In keeping with the plans of the Allied Combined Bomber Offensive, the American B-17 Flying Fortress and B-24 Liberators operating in Europe (factory-equipped with ball turrets) typically bombed by day, thus experiencing far fewer encounters (and relative losses) from . Later similar Japanese experiments with upward-firing cannons on their night fighters in 1944 (intended to target the American B-29 Superfortress fleet firebombing Japan by night) were largely fruitless, owing to the B-29&#x27;s notably superior speed and altitude.

In the initial stages of its operational use by German air crews, from mid-1943 to early 1944, many attacks using achieved complete surprise while destroying many British bombers. The crews that survived such attacks, during this period, often believed that damage and casualties had been caused by ground-based anti-aircraft artillery (AA or AAA), rather than fighters, and much confusion resulted until the cause was successfully pinpointed.
==Background==

===World War I===

During World War I, pusher-configured fighter aircraft with flexibly-mounted forward-firing machine guns (especially the Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2s), enabled gunners to discover the principle of zero-deflection shooting. When firing upward at roughly a 45° elevation, when the attacking aircraft and its target are travelling at about the same speed and the range is fairly short, the trajectory will appear straight. The bullets&#x27; true path is a parabola, but the movement forward of both aircraft, and the air passing the aircraft counter the tendency of the round to arc down after leaving the muzzle so it appears to follow a straight line, simplifying accurate sighting which then requires no deflection or leading of the target.
The pilots of Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2 night fighters, after trying various schemes for attacking the Zeppelin raiders of 1915–1916, hit on the idea of firing a mixture of explosive and incendiary bullets into the body of the airship &quot;from below&quot;. For this purpose a air-cooled Lewis gun was mounted in front of the pilot, firing upward. Exploitation of this led to the destruction of six German airships between September and December 1916. Later British night fighters were similarly armed with upward-firing guns.
Several tractor-configured single-seat biplanes of the time featured machine guns mounted on the centre section of the top wing to fire over the radius of the propeller to bypass the need for synchronization gears). Both the French mountings and the British Foster mounting allowed a machine gun to be tipped back to reload and whether by accident or design, this allowed the gun to be held at an intermediate angle (ideally about 45°) and fired upward, steadying the gun and firing it with the &quot;normal&quot; trigger rather than the remote Bowden cable used for forward firing. These could then be used to attack enemy aircraft from the blind spot below the tail. Most notable of the airplanes used were the Nieuport 11, 16 and 17 and 23 fighters from 1915 onwards, and the tactic was continued in British service, with the Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5s and Sopwith Dolphin. That Dolphin entered service near the end of World War I, and was delivered with a pair of Lewis guns on a cross-tube connecting the upper wing spars. British ace Albert Ball in particular was a great exponent of this technique, The Germans copied the arrangement in 1917, when Gerhard Fieseler of &quot;Jasta&quot; 38 attached two machine guns to an Albatros D.V, pointing upwards and forwards.

===Interwar years===
The Boulton Paul Bittern was a twin-engined night fighter (designed to Specification 27/24) with an armament of barbette mounted guns, that could be angled upwards for attack against bombers, without having to enter a climb. The first of two Bittern prototypes flew in 1927, though performance was poor and the development stopped.
The Westland C.O.W. Gun Fighter (1930) and Vickers Type 161 (1931) were designed in response to Air Ministry specification F.29/27. This called for an interceptor fighter operating as a stable gun platform for the Coventry Ordnance Works 37 mm autocannon produced by the Coventry Ordnance Works (COW).

The COW gun had been developed in 1918 for use in aircraft and had been tested on the Airco DH.4. The cannon fired shells and was to be mounted at 45 deg or more above the horizontal. The tactic was to fly below the target bomber or airship and fire upwards into it. Gun firing trials with both types went well, with no detriment to airframe or performance, although the Westland prototype displayed &quot;alarming&quot; handling characteristics. Neither the Type 161 nor its competitor, the Westland C.O.W. Gun Fighter were ordered, and no more was heard of this use of the aerial COW gun.

Similar logic lay behind the later Vickers Type 414 twin-engined fighter. This aircraft, which can be seen a natural successor to the Vickers COW gun fighter, combined a streamlined monoplane two-seater fighter airframe with a remotely controlled nose-mounted 40mm cannon that could be elevated for no-allowance shooting.
While turret fighters like the Boulton Paul Defiant and the naval Blackburn Roc addressed the same threat – enemy bombers attacking the UK – the approach was very different: upward-firing guns and no-allowance shooting are separate and distinct, and the equipment that can do the one can, generally speaking, be arranged so as to do the other (unless the fixed armament is automatically triggered, as in the photo-cell firing arrangements detailed below). On paper at least, the advantages of flexible aim and weight of fire from a two-seater were clear: the pilot is not overburdened, several fighters could be brought to bear on a target together, and there are two pairs of eyes per aircraft. However, the weight of a powered turret and air gunner imposed performance penalties.

The RAF put the Defiant into service in 1939, intending to use it against bombers, despite the bombers&#x27; numerous gun positions. However, the unexpected German territorial gains in France meant that bombers were escorted by fighters. Despite being utterly outclassed as a day fighter, when moved to the night-fighter role it had some success, typically attacking from below and slightly ahead of the bomber, well outside its field of defensive fire.

Meanwhile, in the United States, the twin-engine Bell YFM-1 Airacuda was designed as a &quot;bomber-destroyer&quot;, touted as &quot;a mobile anti-aircraft platform&quot;. Its armament included mainly forward-firing M4 37mm cannon, with an accompanying gunner mounted in a forward compartment of each of the two engine nacelles. Theoretically, the cannon could be slewed, aimed and fired at an oblique angle but flight tests and operational evaluation, disproved the theory: the type proved troublesome and except for initial flight testing in 1937, where full armament was carried, the nacelle cannon armament and the accompanying gunner–loaders were eliminated in the final development aircraft.
==World War II==

===German developments===
&quot;Oberleutnant&quot; Rudolf Schoenert of 4./NJG 2 decided to experiment with upward-firing guns in 1941 and began trying out upward-firing installations, amid scepticism from his superiors and fellow pilots. The first installation was made late in 1942, in a Dornier Do 17Z-10 that was also equipped with the early UHF-band version of the FuG 202 &quot;Lichtenstein B/C&quot; radar. In July 1942, Schoenert discussed the results of his experiment with General Josef Kammhuber, who authorized the conversion of three Dornier Do 217J-1s, to add a vertical armament of four or six MG 151s. Further experiments were carried out by the Luftwaffe flight testing centre at Tarnewitz on the Baltic Sea coast through 1942. An angle between 60° and 75° was found to give best results, allowing a target turning at 8°/sec to be kept in the gunsight.

Schönert was made CO of II./NJG 5, and an armourer serving with the &quot;Gruppe&quot;, &quot;Oberfeldwebel&quot; Mahle, developed a working arrangement with the unit&#x27;s Messerschmitt Bf 110s, mounting a pair of MG FF/M cannon in the rear compartment of the upper fuselage, firing through twin holes in the canopy&#x27;s glazing. Schönert used such a modified Bf 110 to shoot down a bomber in May 1943. From June 1943, an official conversion kit was produced for the Junkers Ju 88 and Dornier Do 217N fighters. Between August 1943 and the end of the year, Schönert achieved 18 kills with the new gun installation. Before the introduction of &quot;Schräge Musik&quot; in 1943, the &quot;Nachtjagdgeschwadern&quot; (NJG, night fighter wings) were equipped with heavy fighters fitted with radar in the nose and a combination of front-firing and defensive weapons.

In the standard interception, the fighter approached the target from the rear to get into a firing position, presenting the night fighter crew with a much smaller target, a problem compounded by the Royal Air Force bombers (such as the Whitley and Wellington medium bombers) first being fitted with twin-gun hydraulic tail turrets, later upgraded to four guns to fend off just such attacks.

While the small calibre made these tail turret guns less effective than hoped, rear-gunners also maintained a watch for fighters and the pilot would make evasive manoeuvres such as corkscrews. Night-fighter pilots developed a new tactic to avoid the turret guns: instead of approaching directly from the rear they would approach about below the bomber, pull up sharply and start firing when the nose of the bomber appeared in the gunsight. As the fighter slowed and the bomber passed over them, its wings were sprayed with cannon or machine gun rounds. While effective, this manoeuvre was difficult to perform, there was a risk of collision and, if the bomb load exploded, it could destroy the night fighter. Systems similar to the original &quot;Schräge Musik&quot;, such as the &quot;Sondergerät 500&quot; or &quot;Jägerfaust&quot;, were tested on day fighters and other airframes, with the largest-calibre upward-firing aerial ordnance in German service, based on the quintuple-launcher of the 21 cm Nebelwerfer infantry barrage rocket, the experimental heavy-bomber based &quot;Grosszerstörer&quot; (heavy destroyer) also under test.
The &quot;Jägerfaust&quot; system, firing projectiles vertically into the lower sides of bombers, was triggered by an optical device as the pilot passed beneath the target. This was tested on the Fw 190, and was destined for installation in the Messerschmitt Me 163B and the Me 262B. The definitive night fighter version of the Messerschmitt Me 262, the Me 262B-2, was also designed to carry such an installation but it did not work and was not used operationally. Trials with the Me 163 were promising, with six operational aircraft modified. On 10 April 1945, a Halifax bomber was shot down by Fritz Kelb flying a &quot;Jägerfaust&quot;-equipped Me 163B, most probably from I. &quot;Gruppe&quot;/JG 400 operating from Brandis, Germany.

As experimental aircraft were developed as night fighters, such as the Horten Ho 229, a &quot;Schräge Musik&quot; system was incorporated from the start. The experimental Horten Ho 229 flying wing series was proposed for consideration, with a form of unusual upward-firing armament for testing on the V4 night fighter prototype, photoelectric fired vertically mounted rockets or recoilless guns, instead of cannon armament inspired by the &quot;Jagdfaust&quot;.

====Typical installations====
* Dornier Do 217N: 4 × 20 mm MG 151/20
* Focke-Wulf Fw 189: 1 × 20 mm MG151/20 (used mainly on Eastern Front)
* Heinkel He 219: 2 × 30 mm MK 108
* Junkers Ju 88C/G: 2 × 20 mm MG 151/20
* Junkers Ju 388J: 2 × 30 mm MK 108
* Messerschmitt Bf 110G-4: 2 × 20 mm MG FF/M
* Messerschmitt Me 262B-2: 2 × 30 mm MK 108 (proposal only, B-2 version never produced)
* Focke-Wulf Ta 154: 2 × 30 mm MK 108

====Method of sighting guns====
In the Ju 88 G-6 night fighter, which was fast and manoeuvrable, the Revi 16N gunsight was modified to allow the pilot to aim at the target by placing a mirror above his head, parallel to a similar mirror placed behind the gunsight (where the eye would normally be), which was further to the rear, functioning together in the manner of a periscope. The Ju 88 G-6 was guided into position from sighting and final approach by commands from the radar operator, with the pilot only taking over when visual contact was made just prior to firing.

====Operational use====
&quot;Schräge Musik&quot; (or &quot;Schrägwaffen&quot;, as it was also called) was first used operationally during Operation Hydra (the first instance of the Allied bombing of Peenemünde) on the night of 17/18 August 1943. Three waves of aircraft bombed the area, and a diversion on Berlin by RAF Mosquitoes attracted the main &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; fighter effort, which meant that only the last of the three waves was met by many night fighters. Number 5 Group and 6 Group in the third wave lost 29 of their 166 bombers, well over the 10 per cent losses considered &quot;unsustainable&quot;. In this raid 40 aircraft were lost: 23 Lancasters, 15 Halifaxes and two Short Stirlings.

Adoption of &quot;Schräge Musik&quot; began in late 1943 and by 1944, a third of all German night fighters carried upward-firing guns. &quot;Schräge Musik&quot; proved most successful in the Jumo 213 powered Ju 88 G-6. An increasing number of these installations used the more powerful calibre, short-barrelled MK 108 cannon, such as those fitted to the Heinkel He 219, fully contained within the fuselage. By mid-1944, He 219 aircrew were critical of the MK 108 installation, because its low muzzle velocity and limited range, meant that the night fighter had to be close to the bomber to attack and be vulnerable to damage from debris. They demanded that either the MK 108s be removed and replaced by MG FF/Ms or the angle of the mounting be changed. Although He 219s continued to be delivered with the twin 30 mm mounted, these were removed by front line units. Using the &quot;Schräge Musik&quot; required precise timing and swift evasion; a fatally damaged bomber could fall on the night fighter if the fighter could not quickly turn away. The He 219 was particularly prone to this; its high wing loading left it at the edge of stalling speed when matching the Lancaster&#x27;s cruising speed, and therefore quite unmaneuverable. The same was true to a lesser extent of other &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; types such as the Ju 88, which was considered quite a &quot;hot ship&quot; by its crews. This was also a problem during normal stern attacks at low closure rate, but it was even more exaggerated during &quot;Schräge Musik&quot; attacks, since the pilot could not even make use of the limited climb performance available at the edge of the flight envelope to avoid debris from the stricken target.

&quot;Schräge Musik&quot; allowed German night fighters to attack undetected, using special ammunition with a faint glowing trail replacing the standard tracer, combined with a &quot;lethal mixture of armour-piercing, explosive and incendiary ammunition&quot;. Approaching from below provided the night fighter crew with the advantage that the bomber crew could not see them against the dark ground or sky, yet allowed the German crew to see the silhouette of the aircraft before they attacked. The optimum target for the night fighter was the wing fuel tanks, not the fuselage or bomb bay, because of the risk that exploding bombs would damage the attacker. &quot;To overcome some of the problems, many NJG pilots closed the range at a lower level, below the Monica zone of coverage, until they could see the bomber above; then they pulled up into a climb with all front guns blazing. This demanded fine judgement, gave only a second or two of firing time and almost immediately brought the fighter up behind the bomber&#x27;s tail turret.

&quot;Schräge Musik&quot; produced devastating results, with its most successful deployment in the winter of 1943–1944. This was a time when Bomber Command losses became unsupportable: the RAF lost 78 of 823 bombers that attacked Leipzig on 19 February, and 96 of the 795 bombers that attacked Nuremberg on 30/31 March 1944. RAF Bomber Command was slow to react to the threat from &quot;Schräge Musik&quot;, with no reports from shot-down crews reporting the new tactic; the sudden increase in bomber losses had often been attributed to flak. Reports from air gunners of German night fighters stalking their prey from below had appeared as early as 1943 but had been discounted. A myth developed among RAF Bomber Command crews that &quot;scarecrow shells&quot; were encountered over Germany. The phenomenon was thought to be &quot;AA shells simulating an exploding four-engined bomber and designed to damage morale. In many cases these were actual &#x27;kills&#x27; by Luftwaffe night fighters... It was not for many months that evidence of these deadly attacks was accepted.&quot;

A detailed analysis of the damage done to returning bombers clearly showed that the night fighters were firing from below. Defence against the attacks included mixing de Havilland Mosquito night fighters into the bomber stream, to pick up radar emissions from the German night fighters. Wing Commander J. D. Pattinson of 429 &quot;Bison&quot; Squadron, recognized an unseen danger but to him, it &quot;was all presumption, not fact&quot;. He ordered that the mid-upper turrets be removed and the &quot;displaced gunner would lie on a mattress on the floor as an observer, looking through a perspex blister for night fighters coming up from below&quot;. Some early Lancaster B. IIs had retained the FN.64 ventral turret but its sighting periscope provided an overly tight field of view that left the gunner blind, and the traverse speed was too slow, making it useless. A small number of Halifax and Lancaster bombers were fitted with a machine-gun mounted to fire through the hole where the turret would have been, normally of although Canadian units tended to use the machine gun. Initially these were unofficial, but Mod 925 provided an official modification in aircraft not equipped with H2S bombing radar, which covered the turret location.

Even in the last year of the war, 18 months after the Peenemunde Raid, &quot;Schräge Musik&quot; night fighters were still taking a heavy toll, for example on the Mitteland–Ems Canal Raid, 21 February 1945,

===Japan===

In 1943, Commander Yasuna Kozono of the 251st Kōkūtai, Imperial Japanese Navy in Rabaul came up with the idea of converting the Nakajima J1N (J1N1-C) &quot;Irving&quot; into a night fighter. On 21 May 1943, at about the same time as the Luftwaffe&#x27;s &quot;Oberleutnant&quot; Schoenert had his first victory with &quot;Schräge Musik&quot; in Europe, the field-modified J1N1-C KAI shot down two B-17s of the 43rd Bomb Group who were attacking air bases around Rabaul. The Navy took immediate notice and placed orders with Nakajima, for the newly designated J1N1-S night fighter design. This model was christened the Model 11 Gekkō (月光, Moonlight). It required only two crew and like the KAI, had a -calibre twinned pair of Type 99 Model 1 cannon firing upward and a second pair firing downward at a forward 30° angle, also placed in the fuselage behind the cabin. The Type 99 20mm calibre autocannon ordnance used by Japanese aircraft was based on the drum-magazine fed Swiss Oerlikon FF ordnance which was itself the basis for the Germans&#x27; own MG FF weapon, used to pioneer &quot;Schräge Musik&quot; for the Luftwaffe.

The Japanese Army Air Force Mitsubishi Ki-46 &quot;Dinah&quot; twin engined fighter was used to test the &quot;Schräge Musik&quot; armament format in its Ki-46 III KAI version in June 1943, using a 37 mm Ho-203 cannon with 200 rounds of ammunition, the largest calibre autocannon used for Schräge Musik-type operations. It was mounted in a similar position in the fuselage as the Luftwaffe&#x27;s night fighters. Operational deployment began in October 1944.
One of the main Japanese fighters using this device was the Kawasaki Ki-45 &quot;Nick&quot;. With the &quot;Schräge Musik&quot; installation on the Nakajima J1N1-S &quot;Gekkō&quot; (two or three 20mm cannons firing upwards, some had two firing downwards), the Nakajima C6N1-S &quot;Myrt&quot; single-engined, high-speed reconnaissance aircraft was used with a pair of 20 mm Type 99 cannons.

One variant of the common A6M5 Zero single-seat fighter—the A6M5d-S—had a 20mm Type 99 cannon mounted just behind the pilot, firing upwards for night fighter combat.

===United Kingdom===

Air Ministry Specification F.9/37 led to the second, Rolls-Royce Peregrine powered, prototype of the Gloster G39 having its armament installed at an angle of +12° for &#x27;no-allowance&#x27; firing – three dorsal 20mm cannon in the fuselage and two in the nose. While it was a promising aircraft in its own right, by the time that the second prototype was completed the conventionally-armed Bristol Beaufighter was already in production, so neither the G39 nor the subsequent Gloster Reaper were pursued. Similar logic lay behind Air Ministry specification F11/37, which specified a turret-mounted cannon armament: of three companies who tendered (Armstrong Whitworth and Bristol) had turrets that could only traverse through the forward hemisphere, as did Air Ministry specification F22/39, written around the Vickers Type 414 twin-engined fighter, which combined a streamlined monoplane two-seater fighter airframe with a remotely controlled 40mm cannon in the nose that could be elevated for no-allowance shooting.
The Boulton Paul Defiant &quot;turret fighter&quot; was originally conceived under the F.9/35 specification for a &quot;two-seat day and night fighter&quot; to defend Great Britain against massed formations of unescorted enemy bombers. Regardless of the requirement, the use of its dorsal turret was based on the &quot;broadside&quot; fighter interception and combined fighter attack tactic of bomber interception. Attempts to take on single-seat fighters with Defiants led to catastrophic results in 1940 over France and during the Battle of Britain. With such high losses in day operations, the Defiant was transferred to night fighting and there the type achieved some success. Defiant night fighters typically attacked enemy bombers from below, in a similar manoeuvre to the later German &quot;Schräge Musik&quot; attacks, more often from slightly ahead or to one side, rather than from directly under the tail. During the &quot;Blitz&quot; on London of 1940–1941, the Defiant equipped four squadrons, shooting down more enemy aircraft than any other type. The Defiant Mk II was fitted with AI.IV radar and a Merlin XX engine. A total of 207 Defiant Mk IIs were built but the Defiant was retired as radar-equipped Beaufighter and Mosquito night fighters entered service in 1941 and 1942. Turret fighters with four 20mm cannon were specified under F.11/37 but got no further than a scaled prototype.

A Douglas Havoc, &quot;BD126&quot;, was fitted with six upward-firing machine guns in the fuselage behind the cockpit. The guns could be controlled in elevation from 30–50 degrees and 15 degrees in the azimuth by the gunner in the nose. The aircraft was tested at the A&amp;AEE in 1941 and then by the GRU and Fighter Interception Unit.

===United States===

The American Northrop P-61 Black Widow night fighter could deliver a &quot;Schräge Musik&quot;-like surprise of its own, because of the design of its remote dorsal turret carrying a quartet of .50 caliber Browning M2 machine guns, that could elevate to a full 90° position.

==Post-war developments==
The Northrop F-89 Scorpion was originally designed to meet the 1945 United States Army Air Forces Army Air Technical Service Command specification (&quot;Military Characteristics for All-Weather Fighting Aircraft&quot;) for a jet-powered night fighter to replace the P-61 Black Widow. The N-24 company proposal was armed with four 20 mm (.79 in) cannon in a unique trainable nose turret that could rotate 360˚ with the guns able to elevate to 105˚. Ultimately, the F-89 design abandoned the swiveling nose turret in favor of a more standard front-firing cannon arrangement. A similar design – with .50 caliber machine guns – would also be tested on a United States Navy Grumman F9F Panther.

In 1947, the United States Air Force tested a &quot;Schräge Musik&quot; gun installation on a Lockheed F-80A Shooting Star standard &quot;day fighter&quot; aircraft (s/n 44-85044) to study the ability to attack Soviet bombers from below. Twin 0.5 in (12.7 mm) machine guns were fixed in an oblique mount.

A final attempt to exploit a fully traversing turret was found in the original 1948 design of the Curtiss-Wright XF-87 Blackhawk all-weather jet fighter interceptor. Armament was to be a nose-mounted, powered turret containing four 20 mm (.79 in) cannon, but this installation was only fitted to the mock-up and never incorporated in the two prototypes.

In the Soviet Union the concept lasted slightly longer, with elevatable guns being tested on a Mikoyan MiG-17 in the early 1950s.

<text>Martin Behaim (6 October 1459 – 29 July 1507), also known as and by various forms of , was a German textile merchant and cartographer. He served John II of Portugal as an adviser in matters of navigation and participated in a voyage to West Africa. He is now best known for his Erdapfel, the world&#x27;s oldest known globe, which he produced for the Imperial City of Nuremberg in 1492.

==Biography==

Behaim was born in Nuremberg on 6 October 1459, the oldest son of Martin Behaim and Agnes Schopper. The elder Martin was a merchant involved in long-distance trade within Europe, including Venice; in 1461 he was elected a senator of Nuremberg. Their son, as a member of a prominent and prosperous family, likely received a good education at one of the best grammar schools in the city. Contrary to later assertions, it is unlikely that he was ever a student of the famous Renaissance mathematician and astronomer, Regiomontanus.

When his father died in 1474, Martin&#x27;s uncle Leonhard sent him at 15 to Mechelen, Flanders to gain experience as a textile merchant. There he joined the business of Jorius van Dorpp, a vendor of clothing. In 1477 they visited Antwerp where van Dorpp sold his wares to a German merchant; later that same year Behaim attended the Frankfurt fair with Bartels von Eyb, a friend of the family. Writing to his uncle in 1478, Behaim expressed a desire to improve his business prospects by moving to Antwerp, a leading center of the cloth trade. The following year he moved to Antwerp and joined the cloth dye house of Fritz Heberlein, a native of Nuremberg.

In 1484 Behaim moved to Portugal and set up residence in Lisbon. The circumstances behind this move are unclear but Lisbon was the hub of a wide-ranging trade network that included spices, slaves, and gold from Africa and Behaim was likely looking for trading opportunities. He quickly found favor as a counselor in the court of King John II where he supposedly provided advice on navigation and astronomy. However, despite assertions by his early biographers, there is no evidence that Behaim made any significant contributions in these areas. Claims that he taught celestial navigation or introduced the Portuguese to new navigational instruments are belied by the fact that these technologies were already known and used by Portuguese mariners. He may have acted as an importer of scientific instruments, the finest of which were produced at that time in his native town of Nuremberg.

On 18 February 1485 Behaim was knighted by John II, presumably for his contributions as adviser on navigation and astronomy but there is no record of the exact reasons for his honor.

It appears that Behaim participated in a voyage to West Africa around 1485; however it is unlikely that he accompanied Diogo Cão on his second expedition as is sometimes claimed. It is more likely that he participated in a trading voyage to Guinea led by João Afonso de Aveiro.

Following his marriage to Joana de Macedo in 1486, he resided on the Portuguese island of Faial in the Azores, where his father-in-law, Josse van Huerter, was Captain-donatário and leader of the Flemish community. In 1490, Behaim returned to Nuremberg to settle a will case, and remained in the city for three years. He managed to convince leading members of the city council to finance the construction of his famous terrestrial globe under his direction. He returned to Faial in 1493 by way of Flanders and Lisbon, and he remained there until 1506.

Behaim died in the hospice of Saint Bartholomew on 29 July 1507 while visiting Lisbon for business.

==Unsubstantiated claims==
Numerous assertions have been made regarding Behaim&#x27;s accomplishments, some made by himself and others by his early biographers. Since the twentieth century, historians have taken a more critical look at these claims and have concluded that many of them are unsubstantiated by any documentary evidence, and in some cases flatly contradicted by existing documentation.

Historian Johann Christoph Wagenseil claimed in 1682 that Behaim had discovered America before Columbus. Other authors say that Behaim at least gave Columbus the idea of sailing west. There is no evidence that Behaim ever sailed west on a voyage of discovery and although it is possible that Behaim and Columbus met in Lisbon, neither Behaim or Columbus ever referenced such a meeting.

Behaim has been hailed as a great mathematician and astronomer but there is no evidence of a scientific education nor are there any extant scientific writings by him. Behaim claimed to be a disciple of the Renaissance mathematician and astronomer, Regiomontanus. Regiomontanus was a neighbor in Nuremberg when Behaim was a boy, but there is no evidence that they ever studied together.

Biographers have claimed that Behaim accompanied Diogo Cão on his second voyage of discovery. Behaim may have contributed to the misunderstanding by leaving a confused account of an African voyage he made in 1485. The fact is that Behaim&#x27;s dates do not match the dates of this voyage and there is no independent evidence that Behaim sailed with Cão.

Antonio Pigafetta, an Italian writer who accompanied Ferdinand Magellan alleges that Magellan had prior knowledge of a passage to the &quot;Southern Sea&quot; derived from a map made by Behaim. Historians now doubt that Behaim had any direct knowledge of such a passage but he may have depicted mysterious passages in an unknown land which Magellan interpreted as the strait he eventually discovered.

==Behaim globe==



After Behaim returned to Nuremberg in 1490, leading members of the city council financed the construction of a terrestrial globe. Under the direction of Behaim, a team of artisans and craftsmen constructed what has become the oldest extant globe. Georg Glockendon was the artist who created the actual map drawings following Behaim&#x27;s specifications.

The globe is about 21 inches (51 cm) in diameter and was fashioned from a type of papier-mache and coated with gypsum. The ball was supported on a wooden tripod and secured by a pair of iron hoops. Glockendon&#x27;s map drawings were painted onto parchment strips and pasted into position around the sphere. The globe contains more than 2,000 place names, 100 pictorial illustrations (plus 48 banners and 15 coats of arms), and more than 50 long legends. Many of the notations deal with fabulous monsters of foreign countries and their inhabitants, plants and animals. Many notes also deal with trade, explorations, and famous travelers like Marco Polo.

The world map depicted on the Behaim globe is based primarily on the geography of the second-century geographer Ptolemy. It also combines geographical information from other sources, including Marco Polo, John Mandeville, and Portuguese explorer Diogo Gomes. It is notable for lacking more current Portuguese geographic data which should have been available to Behaim and it contains numerous errors that did not reflect contemporary geographical understanding.

The completed globe, which came to be called &quot;Erdapfel&quot; (earth apple) by the townspeople, was originally housed in Nuremberg&#x27;s city hall. In the 17th century the Behaim family took possession of the globe. It was inexpertly restored in 1823 and again in 1847, resulting in the corruption of many place-names and labels. The German National Museum in Nuremberg later took possession of the globe, which is commonly known as the Nuremberg Terrestrial Globe.

The antiquity of this globe and the year of its execution, on the eve of the discovery of the Americas, makes it not just the oldest globe but also represents an encyclopedia of Europe&#x27;s knowledge of the known world in 1492.

<doc id="236321" wikidata="Q1933932" url="?curid=236321" title="Micromanagement">
<text>Micromanagement is a management style characterized by behaviors such as an excessive focus on observing and controlling subordinates and an obsession with details.

Micromanagement generally has a negative connotation, suggesting a lack of freedom and trust in the workplace, and an excessive focus on details at the expense of the &quot;big picture&quot; and larger goals.

==Definition==
Merriam-Webster&#x27;s online dictionary defines micromanagement as &quot;manage[ment] especially with excessive control or attention on details.&quot; 

The online dictionary &quot;Encarta&quot; defined micromanagement as &quot;atten[tion] to small details in management: control [of] a person or a situation by paying extreme attention to small details.&quot;

Dictionary.com defines micromanagement as &quot;manage[ment] or control with excessive attention to minor details.&quot;

Often, this obsession with the most minute of details causes a direct management failure in the loss of focus on the major details.

==Symptoms==

Rather than giving general instructions on smaller tasks and then devoting time to supervising larger concerns, the micromanager monitors and assesses every step of a process and avoids delegation of decisions. Micromanagers are usually irritated when subordinates make decisions without consulting them, even if the decisions are within the subordinates&#x27; level of authority.

Micromanagement also frequently involves requests for unnecessary and overly detailed reports. A micromanager tends to require constant and detailed performance feedback and to focus excessively on procedural minutia (often in detail greater than they can actually process) rather than on overall performance, quality, and results. This micro focus on trivial matters often delays decisions, clouds overall goals and objectives, restricts the flow of information between employees, and guides the various aspects of a project in different and often opposed directions. The sum of such inefficiencies is unlikely to be a net gain for the organization, even if it allows a micromanager retention of control or the mere appearance of it.

It is common for micromanagers, especially those who exhibit narcissistic tendencies and/or micromanage deliberately and for strategic reasons, to delegate work to subordinates and then micromanage those subordinates&#x27; performance, enabling the micromanagers in question to both take credit for positive results and shift the blame for negative results to their subordinates. These micromanagers thereby delegate accountability for failure but not the authority to take alternative actions that would have led to success or at least to the mitigation of that failure.

The most extreme cases of micromanagement constitute a management pathology closely related to workplace bullying and narcissistic behavior. Micromanagement resembles addiction in that although most micromanagers are behaviorally dependent on control over others, both as a lifestyle and as a means of maintaining that lifestyle, many of them fail to recognize and acknowledge their dependence even when everyone around them observes it.

Although micromanagers may have good intentions, micromanaging most often arises due to a lack of trust and respect. Some common reasons why people micromanage include:

* Fear of loss of control over projects
* A belief that work deemed superior to their own may make them look inadequate
* Extreme need for control and domination
* Poor self-image and insecurities
* Inexperience in management

==Causes==
The most frequent motivations for micromanagement are internal and related to the personality of the manager. However, the external factors such as organizational culture may also play a major role. Other factors which can induce micromanagement include the importance of a project and its timeline, with more important work and more demanding deadlines increasing the stakes for the manager in charge.

Micromanagement can also stem from such dynamics as a breakdown in the fundamentals of delegation and lack of trust. When a task or project is delegated in an unclear way, or where a lack of confidence exists between the manager and the person doing the work, both common characteristics of too little management, micromanagement, however, may instead ensue. Preventatives include clear delegation, a well defined goal, and a firm grasp of constraints and .

==Effects==
Micromanagement can have profound psychological effects on employees. It often leads to increased stress, anxiety, and a sense of helplessness. Employees may feel undervalued and lose confidence in their abilities. Over time, this can result in burnout and a high turnover rate. Understanding these impacts can help both managers and employees address the root causes of micromanagement. 

Stress and Anxiety

When employees are constantly monitored and controlled, it creates a high-stress environment. The fear of making mistakes and the pressure to meet unrealistic expectations can lead to anxiety. This stress can spill over into personal life, affecting overall well-being.

Loss of Confidence

Micromanagement sends a message that the manager does not trust the employee’s abilities. This lack of trust can erode self-confidence and make employees doubt their skills and judgment. Over time, this can lead to a decrease in job satisfaction and motivation.

Burnout

The constant pressure and lack of autonomy can lead to burnout. Employees may feel exhausted, both physically and emotionally, and lose interest in their work. Burnout can result in decreased productivity and increased absenteeism.

Beyond individual psychological effects, micromanagement can have broader organizational consequences. These include reduced team cohesion, lower overall productivity, and a negative workplace culture.

Reduced Team Cohesion

Micromanagement can create a divide between managers and employees, leading to a lack of trust and collaboration. Team members may become less willing to share ideas or take initiative, fearing criticism or interference.

Lower Productivity

While micromanagers may believe they are ensuring high standards, the opposite is often true. Constant oversight can slow down processes, as employees wait for approvals and second-guess their decisions. This can lead to missed deadlines and reduced efficiency.

Negative Workplace Culture

A culture of micromanagement can permeate an organization, affecting morale and engagement. Employees may feel demotivated and disengaged, leading to higher turnover rates and difficulty attracting top talent.

<text>Plone is a free and open source content management system (CMS) built on top of the Zope application server. Plone is positioned as an enterprise CMS and is commonly used for intranets and as part of the web presence of large organizations. High-profile public sector users include the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, Brazilian Government, United Nations, City of Bern (Switzerland), New South Wales Government (Australia), and European Environment Agency. Plone&#x27;s proponents cite its security track record and its accessibility as reasons to choose Plone.

Plone has a long tradition of development occurring in so-called &quot;sprints&quot;, in-person meetings of developers over the course of several days, the first occurring in 2003 and nine occurring in 2014. The largest sprint of the year is the sprint immediately following the annual conference. Certain other sprints are considered &quot;strategic&quot; so are funded directly by the Plone Foundation, although very few attendees are sponsored directly. The Plone Foundation also holds and enforces all copyrights and trademarks in Plone, and is assisted by legal counsel from the Software Freedom Law Center.

== History ==
The Plone project began in 1999 by Alexander Limi, Alan Runyan, and Vidar Andersen. It was made as a usability layer on top of the Zope Content Management Framework. The first version was released in 2001. The project quickly grew into a community, receiving plenty of new add-on products from its users. The increase in community led to the creation of the annual Plone conference in 2003, which is still running today. In addition, &quot;sprints&quot; are held, where groups of developers meet to work on Plone, ranging from a couple of days to a week. In March 2004, Plone 2.0 was released. This release brought more customizable features to Plone, and enhanced the add-on functions. In May 2004, the Plone Foundation was created for the development, marketing, and protection of Plone. The Foundation has ownership rights over the Plone codebase, trademarks, and domain names. Even though the foundation was set up to protect ownership rights, Plone remains open source.
On March 12, 2007, Plone 3 was released. This new release brought inline editing, an upgraded visual editor, and strengthened security, among many other enhancements. Plone 4 was released in September 2010. Plone won two Packt Open Source CMS Awards.

===Release history===

==Design==
Plone runs on the Zope application server, which is written in Python. Plone by default stores all information in Zope&#x27;s built-in transactional object database (ZODB). It comes with installers for Windows, macOS, and Linux, along with other operating systems. New updates are released regularly on Plone&#x27;s website. Plone is available in over 50 languages. It complies with WCAG 2.0 AA and U.S. section 508, which allows people with disabilities to access and use Plone. A major part of Plone is its use of skins and themes. Plone&#x27;s Diazo theming engine can be used to customize a website&#x27;s look. These themes are written with JavaScript, HTML, XSLT, and Cascading Style Sheets. In addition, Plone comes with a user management system called Pluggable Authentication Service (PAS). PAS is used to search for users and groups in Plone. Most importantly, PAS covers the security involved for users and groups, requiring authentication in order to log into Plone. This gives users an increase in both security and organization with their content.
A large part of Plone&#x27;s changes have come from its community. Since Plone is open source, the members of the Plone community regularly make alterations or add-ons to Plone&#x27;s interface, and make these changes available to the rest of the community via Plone&#x27;s website.

The name Plone comes from a band by that name and &quot;Plone should look and feel like the band sounds&quot;.

===Languages===
Plone is built on the Zope application framework and therefore is primarily written in Python but also contains large amounts of HTML and CSS, as well as JavaScript. Plone uses jQuery as its Javascript framework in current versions, after abandoning a declarative framework for progressive enhancement called KSS. Plone uses an XML dialect called ZCML for configuration, as well as an XML based templating language, meaning approximately 10% of the total source code is XML based.

==Add-on products==
The community supports and distributes thousands of add-ons via company websites but mostly through PYPI and www.plone.org. There are currently 2149 packages available via PyPI for customizing Plone.

Since its release, many of Plone&#x27;s updates and add-ons have come from its community. Events called Plone &quot;sprints&quot; consist of members of the community coming together for a week and helping improve Plone. The Plone conference is also attended and supported by the members of the Plone community. In addition, Plone has an active IRC channel to give support to users who have questions or concerns. Up through 2007, there have been over one million downloads of Plone. Plone&#x27;s development team has also been ranked in the top 2% of the largest open source communities.

== Strengths and weaknesses ==
A 2007 comparison of CMSes rated Plone highly in a number of categories (standards conformance, access control, internationalization, aggregation, user-generated content, micro-applications, active user groups and value). However, as most of the major CMSes, including Plone, Drupal, WordPress and Joomla, have undergone major development since then, only limited value can be drawn from this comparison. Plone is available on many different operating systems, due to its use of platform-independent underlying technologies such as Python and Zope. Plone&#x27;s Web-based administrative interface is optimized for standards, allowing it to work with most common web browsers, and uses additional accessibility standards to help users with disabilities. All of Plone&#x27;s features are customizable, and free add-ons are available from the Plone website.

===Focus on security===
Mitre is a not-for-profit corporation which hosts the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) Database. The CVE database provides a worldwide reporting mechanism for developers and the industry and is a source feed into the U.S. National Vulnerability Database (NVD). According to Mitre, Plone has the lowest number of reported lifetime and year to date vulnerabilities when compared to other popular Content Management Systems. This security record has led to widespread adoption of Plone by government and non-governmental organizations, including the FBI.

The following table compares the number of CVEs as reported by Mitre. Logged CVEs take into account vulnerabilities exposed in the core product as well as the modules of the software, of which, the included modules may be provided by 3rd party vendors and not the primary software provider.

<doc id="236323" wikidata="Q25417" url="?curid=236323" title="Danish krone">
<text>The krone (; plural: &quot;kroner&quot;; sign: kr.; code: DKK) is the official currency of Denmark, Greenland, and the Faroe Islands, introduced on 1 January 1875. Both the ISO code &quot;DKK&quot; and currency sign &quot;kr.&quot; are in common use; the former precedes the value, the latter in some contexts follows it. The currency is sometimes referred to as the Danish [[Crown (currency)|crown]] in English, since &quot;krone&quot; literally means crown. Krone coins have been minted in Denmark since the 17th century.

One krone is subdivided into 100 &quot;øre&quot; (; singular and plural), the name &quot;øre&quot; is probably derived from the Latin word for gold. Altogether there are eleven denominations of the krone, with the smallest being the 50 øre coin (one half of a krone). Formerly there were more øre coins, but those were discontinued due to inflation.

The krone is pegged to the euro via the ERM II, the European Union&#x27;s exchange rate mechanism. Adoption of the euro is favoured by some of the major political parties; however, a 2000 referendum on joining the Eurozone was defeated with 53.2% voting to maintain the krone and 46.8% voting to join the Eurozone.

==History==
The oldest known Danish coin is a penny () struck AD 825–840, but the earliest systematic minting produced the so-called () minted by Harald Bluetooth in the late 10th century.
Organised minting in Denmark was introduced on a larger scale by Canute the Great in the 1020s. 
Lund (now in Sweden) was the principal minting place and one of Denmark&#x27;s most important cities in the Middle Ages, but coins were also minted in Roskilde, Slagelse, Odense, Aalborg, Århus, Viborg, Ribe, Ørbæk and Hedeby. For almost 1,000 years, Danish kings – with a few exceptions – have issued coins with their name, monogram and/or portrait.

Danish coinage was generally based on the Carolingian silver standard, with 12 &quot;penning&quot; to a &quot;skilling&quot; and 20 &quot;skilling&quot; to a pound; later on, 16 &quot;skilling&quot; to a mark. The metal content of minted coins was subject to debasement over the centuries, an easy way to generate income for the monarch and/or the state. Taxes were sometimes imposed via the coinage, such as by the compulsory substitution of coins handed in by new coins handed out with a lower silver content. As a result of the debasement, the public started to lose trust in the respective coins. Danish currency was overhauled several times in attempts to restore public trust in the coins, and later issued in paper money.

Several different currency systems have been used by Denmark from the 16th to 19th centuries. The &quot;krone&quot; (lit. &quot;crown&quot;) has existed as early as 1513 as a unit of account worth 8 marks. In more general use until 1813, however, was a &quot;krone&quot; or &quot;schlecht daler&quot; worth rigsdaler, 4 marks, or 64 skilling.

The modern-day krone was introduced as the currency of Denmark in January 1875. It replaced the rigsdaler at a rate of 2 kroner = 1 rigsdaler. This placed the krone on the gold standard at a rate of 2,480 kroner = 1 kilogram fine gold. The latter part of the 18th century and much of the 19th century saw expanding economic activity and thus also a need for means of payment that were easier to handle than coins. Consequently, banknotes were increasingly used instead of coins.

The Danish krone was minted by the Royal Mint of Denmark and banknotes were printed by the Danish National Bank until 1975, when the mint was made a subsidiary of the National Bank.
In 2014, it was decided to stop minting and printing of the krone in Denmark, but the work would be outsourced, and on 20 December 2016, the last notes were printed by the National Bank.

==Current status==

===Relationship to the euro===

Denmark has not introduced the euro, following a rejection by referendum in 2000, but the Danish krone is pegged closely to the euro (with the rate 7.46038±2.25%) in ERM II, the EU&#x27;s exchange rate mechanism. Denmark borders one eurozone member, Germany, and one other EU member, Sweden, which is legally obliged to join the euro in the future (though Sweden maintains that joining ERM II is voluntary, thus avoiding euro adoption for the time being).

===Faroe Islands and Greenland===

The Faroe Islands uses a localised, non-independent version of the Danish krone, known as the &quot;Faroese króna&quot; pegged with the Danish krone at par, using the Danish coin series, but have their own series of distinct banknotes, first being issued in the 1950s and later modernised in the 1970s and the 2000s.

Greenland adopted the Act on Banknotes in Greenland in 2006 with a view to introducing separate Greenlandic banknotes. The Act entered into force on 1 June 2007. In the autumn of 2010, a new Greenlandic government indicated that it did not wish to introduce separate Greenlandic banknotes and Danmarks Nationalbank ceased the project to develop a Greenlandic series. Still, Greenland continues to use Danish kroner as sole official currency.
Historically, Greenland under the colonial administration issued distinct banknotes between 1803 and 1968, together with coins between 1926 and 1964 (see Greenland rigsdaler and Greenland krone).

Faroe Islands and Greenland have their own IBAN codes (FO and GL, while Denmark has DK). Transfers between the countries count as international with international fees, outside EU rules.

==Coins==

===Alloys and colour scheme===

The design of the coin series is intended to ensure that the coins are easy to distinguish from each other:

The series is therefore divided into three sequences, each with its own metal colour. This division into colours has its roots in history. In earlier times, the value of the coins was equivalent to the value of the metal from which they were minted: gold was used for the coins of the highest denominations, silver for the next-highest, and copper for the lowest coin denominations. This correlation between colour and value has been retained in the present coin series (see examples to the right). The 50 øre coins are thus minted from copper-coloured bronze, the 1, 2 and 5 krone coins from a silver-coloured cupronickel alloy, and the 10 and 20 krone coins from golden aluminium bronze.

The coins differ in terms of size, weight and rim. Within each sequence the diameter and weight of the coins increase with their value. The 50 øre and 10 krone coins have smooth rims, while the rims of the 1 and 5 krone coins are milled. The rims of the 2 and 20 krone coins have interrupted milling. The 1, 2 and 5 krone coins have a hole in the middle. Use of these various characteristics makes it easy for the blind and sight-impaired to tell the coins apart.

===Commemoratives and thematic coins===
The coins of the programme have the same size and metal composition as the regular coins of their denomination.

The first series, 20-krone coins featuring towers in Denmark, ran between 2002 and 2007 and spawned ten different motifs. Upon selecting the towers, importance had been attached not only to display aesthetic towers, but also towers with different form, functions and from different regions of Denmark, the Faroe Islands and Greenland. The last coin depicting the Copenhagen City Hall was issued in June 2007, marking the end of the series.
A second series of 20-krone coins, starting in 2007 with twelve different planned motifs and ten already released by November 2011, shows Denmark as a maritime nation in the world, featuring iconic Danish, Faroese and Greenlandic ships and like the previous series of tower coins, the series reflect various landmarks in shipbuilding in the three countries.

In 2005, Danmarks Nationalbank issued the first in a series of five 10-krone commemorative coins with motifs from Hans Christian Andersen&#x27;s fairy tales. The motifs depicted on the coins were chosen to illustrate various aspects and themes central to the fairy tales with the fifth and final fairy tale coin inspired by The Nightingale being issued on 25 October 2007. 
In 2007, as the fairy tale series ended, a second series of three 10-krone commemorative coins was introduced, celebrating the International Polar Year. Featuring motifs of a polar bear, the Sirius Sledge Patrol and the Aurora Borealis, the coins aimed to accentuate scientific research in the backdrop of Greenlandic culture and geography. The third and final coin entitled &#x27;Northern Lights&#x27; marked the completion of the series in 2009.

==Banknotes==
Most Danish banknotes (with a few exceptions) issued after 1945 are valid as payment. Banknotes have since 1945 been issued with the values: 5 kroner, 10 kroner, 20 kroner, 50 kroner, 100 kroner, 200 kroner, 500 kroner, and 1000 kroner.

On 30 November 2023, it was announced that all banknotes issued before 2009 will no longer be legal tender as of 31 May 2025. The 1000-kroner banknote will also be phased out on the same date. Phased out banknotes will continue to be accepted by Danmarks Nationalbank until 31 May 2026.

===1944 series===
The 1944 series, known as the substitution series, was developed in secret in 1943−1944 and designed by Danish painter Gerhard Heilmann.

===1952 series===
The 1952 series featured portraits and landscapes, and was issued from 1952 to 1964. It was replaced in 1972. Featuring famous Danes on the obverse and Danish landscapes on the reverse, the banknotes were designed by , Gunnar Andersen, and .

===1972 series===

The 1972 series featured portraits and animals, and was issued from 1975 to 1980. It was replaced in 1997. Every note had a portrait based on a painting by Jens Juel on the obverse side. The reverse featured animals designed by Ib Andersen and Gunnar Andersen.

===1997 series===

The 1997 series features portraits and church art, and was issued from 1997 to 1999. It was replaced in 2009. Illustrated by Johan Alkjær, the banknotes featured portraits of Danish artists and scientists on the obverse while the reverse had motifs of cultural and religious art.

===2009 series===

The process of designing the &#x27;Bridge&#x27; banknotes was initiated in 2006 by Danmarks Nationalbank. The theme of the new banknotes is Danish bridges and the surrounding landscapes, or details from these landscapes. Danish artist Karin Birgitte Lund has chosen to interpret this theme in two ways: bridges as links between various parts of Denmark and as links between the past and the present. The present is represented by the bridges, the past by five distinctive prehistoric objects found near the bridges. Among the new security features is a window thread (&quot;Motion&quot;) with a moving wave pattern. Another feature is a new, sophisticated hologram that reflects light in different colors. The new banknotes also have the traditional security features such as the watermark and the hidden security thread.

Starting in 2020, Danmarks Nationalbank released a new version of the 500-kroner banknote with updated security features, the first in the 2009A series. Updated versions of the 50-, 100-, and 200-kroner banknotes are scheduled to enter circulation in 2024–2025.

===2028 series===
The next series of banknotes is scheduled for release in 2028 and will not contain a 1000-krone banknote, which will no longer be legal tender as of 31 May 2025, with that banknote being withdrawn in order to combat and prevent money laundering. Banknotes from the new series and the 2009 series will co-circulate for a period of time and eventually only the new series of banknotes will be legal tender. The design process started in the spring of 2024, and they are scheduled to be finalised in early 2026. In September 2024, it was announced that the obverse of the banknotes would feature &quot;important achievements and the people behind them&quot; whereas the reverse will feature the sea as a motif. The selected achievements and people are as follows:
* Fairy tales and Hans Christian Andersen
* Astronomy and Tycho Brahe
* The Earth&#x27;s core and Inge Lehmann
* The Thule Expedition and Arnarulunnguaq

<text>In United States labor law, a hostile work environment exists when one&#x27;s behavior within a workplace creates an environment that is difficult or uncomfortable for another person to work in, due to illegal discrimination. However, a working environment that is unpleasant and frightening for the victim due to sexual advances that have been denied by the victim, is what constitutes hostile work environment sexual harassment. Common complaints in sexual harassment lawsuits include sexual gossip unrelated to work, jokes about physical contact inappropriate in workplace, commentary on physical appearance/attractiveness, joking about sex acts, fondling, suggestive remarks, sexually-suggestive photos displayed in the workplace, use of sexual language, or off-color jokes. Small matters, annoyances, and isolated incidents are usually not considered to be statutory violations of the discrimination laws. For a violation to impose liability, the conduct must create a work environment that would be intimidating, hostile, or offensive to a reasonable person. An employer can be held liable for failing to prevent these workplace conditions, unless it can prove that it attempted to prevent the harassment and that the employee failed to take advantage of existing harassment counter-measures or tools provided by the employer.

A hostile work environment may also be created when management acts in a manner designed to make an employee quit in retaliation for some action. For example, if an employee reported safety violations at work, was injured, attempted to join a union, or reported regulatory violations by management, and management&#x27;s response was to harass and pressure the employee to quit. Employers have tried to force employees to quit by imposing unwarranted discipline, reducing hours, cutting wages, or transferring the complaining employee to a distant work location.

The United States Supreme Court stated in &quot;Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.&quot; that Title VII is &quot;not a general civility code&quot;. Thus, federal law does not prohibit simple teasing, offhand comments, or isolated incidents that are not extremely serious. Rather, the conduct must be so objectively offensive as to alter the conditions of the individual&#x27;s employment. The conditions of employment are altered only if the harassment culminates in a tangible employment action or is sufficiently severe or pervasive.

== Workplace Harassment Precedent for the Reasonable Woman ==
The intricacy of workplace sexual harassment is not well represented by the reasonable woman criterion. It falls under the impression that a ‘reasonable woman’ does not get sexually harassed at work, thus creating a hostile workplace. Still, the article goes against the fact that that definition of a ‘reasonable woman’ is not entirely true to reality. The truth is that many women are dealing with hostile workplace environments. There are court cases that adopted the idea that sexual harassment creates a hostile workplace environment. The court case that shifted us from ‘reasonable person’ to ‘reasonable woman’ was &quot;Ellison v. Brady, 1991&quot;. This case is extremely important because it gave new meaning to the word. The new standard was behavior a reasonable woman would think was extreme enough to change the terms of employment and establish a hostile work environment.

==Burdens of proof==
Where a hostile environment is alleged, the legality of behaviors must be determined on a case by case basis. In the workplace, such a claim focuses on the working conditions that must be experienced by the victim as a condition of employment, rather than on tangible job changes. To establish whether the situation is actionable the &quot;totality of circumstances&quot; must be weighed with an eye to determining &quot;that the harassment affected a term, condition, or privilege of employment in that it was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the condition of the victim&#x27;s employment and create an abusive working environment&quot;.

== Relation to other laws ==
In many United States jurisdictions, a hostile work environment is not an independent legal claim. That is, an employee could not file a lawsuit on the basis of a hostile work environment alone. Instead, an employee must prove they have been treated in a hostile manner &quot;because&quot; of their membership in a protected class, such as gender, age, race, national origin, disability status, and similar protected traits. Importantly, the hostile work environment is gender neutral, meaning that men can sexually harass men or women and women can sexually harass men or women.

Likewise, a hostile work environment can be considered the &quot;adverse employment action&quot; that is an element of a whistleblower claim or a reprisal (retaliation) claim under a civil rights statute. When an employee claims that a hostile work environment is an adverse employment action, the legal analysis is similar to the burdens of proof described above. However, to recover damages, the employee must also establish all other elements of the claim, such as that the employee engaged in protected conduct such as making a report of discrimination or reporting an employer&#x27;s violation of law, and also establish that the employer created the hostile work environment, at least in part, because the employee engaged in the protected activity.

<doc id="236327" wikidata="Q1157002" url="?curid=236327" title="Lawrence v. Texas">
<text>Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003), is a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in which the Court ruled that U.S. state laws criminalizing sodomy between consenting adults are unconstitutional. The Court reaffirmed the concept of a &quot;right to privacy&quot; that earlier cases had found the U.S. Constitution provides, even though it is not explicitly enumerated. It based its ruling on the notions of personal autonomy to define one&#x27;s own relationships and of American traditions of non-interference with any or all forms of private sexual activities between consenting adults.

In 1998, John Geddes Lawrence Jr., an older white man, was arrested along with Tyron Garner, a younger black man, at Lawrence&#x27;s apartment in Harris County, Texas. Garner&#x27;s former boyfriend had called the police, claiming that there was a man with a weapon in the apartment. Sheriff&#x27;s deputies said they found the men engaging in sexual intercourse. Lawrence and Garner were charged with a misdemeanor under Texas&#x27; anti-sodomy law; both pleaded no contest and received a fine. Assisted by the American civil rights organization Lambda Legal, Lawrence and Garner appealed their sentences to the Texas Courts of Appeals, which ruled in 2000 that the sodomy law was unconstitutional. Texas appealed to have the court rehear the case &quot;en banc&quot;, and in 2001 it overturned its prior judgment and upheld the law. Lawrence appealed this decision to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, which denied his request for appeal. Lawrence then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which agreed to hear his case.

The Supreme Court struck down the sodomy law in Texas in a 6–3 decision, and by extension invalidated sodomy laws in 13 other states, making all forms of private, consensual non-procreative sexual activities between two consenting individuals of either sex (especially of the same sex) legal in every U.S. state and territory. The Court, with a five-justice majority, overturned its previous ruling on the same issue in the 1986 case &quot;Bowers v. Hardwick&quot;, where it upheld a challenged Georgia statute and did not find a constitutional protection of sexual privacy. It explicitly overruled &quot;Bowers&quot;, holding that it had viewed the liberty interest too narrowly. The Court held that intimate consensual sexual conduct was part of the liberty protected by substantive due process under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. &quot;Lawrence&quot; invalidated similar laws throughout the United States that criminalized sodomy between consenting adults acting in private, whatever the sex of the participants.

The case attracted much public attention, and 33 &quot;amici curiae&quot; (&quot;friends of the court&quot;) briefs were filed. Its outcome was celebrated by gay rights advocates, and set the stage for further reconsideration of standing law, including the landmark cases of &quot;United States v. Windsor&quot; (2013), which invalidated Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act, and &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot; (2015), which recognized same-sex marriage as a fundamental right under the United States Constitution.

== Background ==
Legal punishments for sodomy often included heavy fines, prison sentences, or both, with some states, beginning with Illinois in 1827, denying other rights, such as suffrage, to anyone convicted of the crime of sodomy. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, several states imposed various eugenics laws against anyone deemed to be a &quot;sexual pervert&quot;. As late as 1970, Connecticut denied a driver&#x27;s license to a man for being an &quot;admitted homosexual&quot;.

As of 1960, every state had an anti-sodomy law. In 1961, the American Law Institute&#x27;s Model Penal Code advocated the repeal of sodomy laws as they applied to private, adult, consensual behavior. Two years later the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) took its first major case in opposition to these laws.

In &quot;Griswold v. Connecticut&quot; (1965), the Supreme Court struck down a law barring the use of contraceptives by married couples. In &quot;Griswold,&quot; the Supreme Court recognized for the first time that couples, at least married couples, had a right to privacy, drawing on the Fourth Amendment&#x27;s protection of private homes from searches and seizures without a warrant based on probable cause, the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s guarantee of due process of law in the states, and the Ninth Amendment&#x27;s assurance that rights not specified in the Constitution are &quot;retained by the people&quot;. &quot;Eisenstadt v. Baird&quot; (1972) expanded the scope of sexual privacy rights to unmarried persons. In 1973, in &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; the US Supreme court extended that right to privacy to protect a woman&#x27;s right to have an abortion, although the extent to which that might be regulated by the government varied, with almost absolute protection in the first trimester, and allowing for increasing regulation as the pregnancy progressed.

In &quot;Bowers v. Hardwick&quot; (1986), the Supreme Court heard a constitutional challenge to sodomy laws brought by a man who had been arrested, but was not prosecuted, for engaging in oral sex with another man in his home. The Court rejected this challenge in a 5 to 4 decision. Justice Byron White&#x27;s majority opinion emphasized that &quot;Eisenstadt&quot; and &quot;Roe&quot; had only recognized a right to engage in procreative sexual activity, and that long-standing moral antipathy toward homosexual sodomy was enough to argue against the notion of a right to sodomy. Justice Blackmun, writing in dissent, argued that &quot;Eisenstadt&quot; held that the Constitution protects people as individuals, not as family units. He then reasoned that because state intrusions are equally burdensome on an individual&#x27;s personal life regardless of his marital status or sexual orientation, there is no reason to treat the rights of citizens in same-sex couples any differently.

By the time of the &quot;Lawrence&quot; decision, ten states—Alabama, Florida, Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Michigan, Utah, and Virginia—still banned consensual sodomy without respect to the sex of those involved, and four—Texas, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Missouri (partially)—prohibited same-sex couples from engaging in anal and oral sex.

== History ==

=== Arrest of Lawrence and Garner ===
On September 17, 1998, John Geddes Lawrence Jr., a gay 55-year-old medical technologist, was hosting two gay acquaintances, Tyron Garner, age 31, and Robert Eubanks, 40, at his apartment in northeast Harris County, Texas, east of the Houston city limits. Lawrence and Eubanks had been friends for more than 20 years. Garner and Eubanks had had an intermittent romantic relationship since 1990. Lacking transportation home, the couple were preparing to spend the night. Eubanks, who had been drinking heavily, left to purchase a soda from a nearby vending machine. Apparently outraged that Lawrence had been flirting with Garner, he called police and reported &quot;a black male going crazy with a gun&quot; at Lawrence&#x27;s apartment.

Four Harris County sheriff&#x27;s deputies responded within minutes and Eubanks pointed them to the apartment. They entered the unlocked apartment toward 11 p.m. with their weapons drawn. In accordance with police procedures, the first to arrive, Joseph Quinn, took the lead both in approaching the scene and later in determining what charges to bring. He later reported seeing Lawrence and Garner having anal sex in the bedroom. A second officer reported seeing them engaged in oral sex, and two others did not report seeing the pair having sex. Lawrence repeatedly challenged the police for entering his home. Quinn had discretionary authority to charge them for a variety of offenses and to determine whether to arrest them. When Quinn considered charging them with having sex in violation of state law, he had to get an Assistant District Attorney to check the statutes to be certain they covered sexual activity inside a residence. He was told that Texas&#x27; anti-sodomy statute, the &quot;Homosexual Conduct&quot; law, made it a Class C misdemeanor if someone &quot;engages in deviate sexual intercourse with another individual of the same sex&quot;. The statute, Chapter 21, Sec. 21.06 of the Texas Penal Code, had been adopted in 1973 when the state revised its criminal code to end its proscription on heterosexual anal and oral intercourse.

Quinn decided to arrest Lawrence and Garner and charge them with having &quot;deviate sex&quot;. In the separate arrest reports he filed for each, he wrote that he had seen the arrestee &quot;engaged in deviate sexual conduct namely, anal sex, with another man&quot;. Lawrence and Garner were held in jail overnight. At a hearing the next day, they pleaded not guilty to a charge of &quot;homosexual conduct&quot;. They were released toward midnight. Eubanks pleaded no contest to charges of filing a false police report. He was sentenced to 30 days in jail but was released early.

=== Prosecution and appeals ===
The gay rights advocates from Lambda Legal litigating the case convinced Lawrence and Garner not to contest the charges and to plead no contest instead. On November 20, Lawrence and Garner pleaded no contest to the charges and waived their right to a trial. Justice of the Peace Mike Parrott found them guilty and imposed a $100 fine and court costs of $41.25 on each defendant. When the defense attorneys realized that the fine was below the minimum required to permit them to appeal the convictions, they asked the judge to impose a higher penalty. Parrott, well aware that the attorneys intended to use the case to raise a constitutional challenge, increased it to $125 with the agreement of the prosecutor.

To appeal, Lawrence and Garner needed to have their cases tried in Harris County Criminal Court. Their attorneys asked the court to dismiss the charges against them on Fourteenth Amendment equal protection grounds, claiming that the law was unconstitutional since it prohibited sodomy between same-sex couples, but not between heterosexual couples. They also asserted a right to privacy and that the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Bowers v. Hardwick&quot; that found no privacy protection for consensual sex between homosexuals was &quot;wrongly decided&quot;. On December 22, Judge Sherman Ross denied the defense motions to dismiss. The defendants again pleaded &quot;no contest&quot;. Ross fined them $200 each, the amount agreed upon in advance by both sides.

A three-judge panel of the Texas Fourteenth Court of Appeals heard the case on November 3, 1999. Their 2–1 decision issued on June 8, 2000, ruled the Texas law was unconstitutional. Justice John S. Anderson and Chief Justice Paul Murphy found that the law violated the 1972 Equal Rights Amendment to the Texas Constitution, which bars discrimination based on sex, race, color, creed, or national origin. J. Harvey Hudson dissented. The Court of Appeals decided to review the case &quot;en banc&quot;. On March 15, 2001, without hearing oral arguments, it reversed the three-judge panel&#x27;s decision and upheld the law&#x27;s constitutionality 7–2, denying both the substantive due process and equal protection arguments. Attorneys for Lawrence and Garner asked the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the highest appellate court in Texas for criminal matters, to review the case. After a year&#x27;s delay, on April 17, 2002, that request was denied. Lambda Legal&#x27;s Harlow called that decision &quot;a major abdication of judicial responsibility&quot;. Bill Delmore, the Harris County prosecutor who argued the case, called the judges &quot;big chickens&quot; and said: &quot;They have a history of avoiding the hot potato cases if they can.&quot;

== Consideration by the Supreme Court ==
In a petition for &quot;certiorari&quot; filed in the U.S. Supreme Court on July 16, 2002, Lambda Legal attorneys asked the Court to consider:

#Whether the petitioners&#x27; criminal convictions under the Texas &quot;Homosexual Conduct&quot; law—which criminalizes sexual intimacy by same-sex couples, but not identical behavior by different-sex couples—violate the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of equal protection of the laws;
#Whether the petitioners&#x27; criminal convictions for adult consensual sexual intimacy in their home violate their vital interests in liberty and privacy protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment;
#Whether &quot;Bowers v. Hardwick&quot; should be overruled.

On December 2, 2002, the Court agreed to hear the case. Lambda Legal coordinated the submission of sixteen &quot;amicus curiae&quot; briefs to complement their own brief. Submitting organizations included the American Bar Association, the American Psychological Society, the American Public Health Association, the Cato Institute, the Log Cabin Republicans, a group of history professors, and a group of religious denominations. An op-ed in support by former Senator Alan Simpson appeared in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; on the morning scheduled for oral argument. The attorneys for Texas did not control the &quot;amicus&quot; briefs submitted in support of their position by representatives of religious and social conservatism, including Jay Alan Sekulow and Robert P. George. Several, including that of Liberty Counsel, depicted homosexuals as self-destructive, disease-prone, and promiscuous. The states of Alabama, South Carolina, and Utah advised the Court that unlike heterosexual sodomy, homosexual sodomy had &quot;severe physical, emotional, psychological, and spiritual consequences&quot;.

At oral argument on March 26, 2003, Paul M. Smith, an experienced litigator who had argued eight cases before the Supreme Court, spoke on behalf of the plaintiffs. Texas Attorney General John Cornyn, then a candidate for the U.S. Senate, refused to have his office argue the case. Charles A. Rosenthal, District Attorney of Harris County, represented the state. His performance was later described as &quot;the worst oral argument in years&quot;, but some believe his lack of preparation reflected his lack of enthusiasm for the statute he was defending.

== Decision ==
On June 26, 2003, the Supreme Court issued a 6–3 decision in favor of Lawrence that struck down Texas&#x27;s statute. Five justices held it violated the Due Process Clause, while a sixth, Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor, held it violated the Equal Protection Clause.

=== Opinion of the Court ===

Five justices formed the majority and joined an opinion written by Justice Anthony Kennedy. The Court ruled that Texas&#x27;s law prohibiting private homosexual activity between consenting adults violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The Court did not describe private sexual activity as a fundamental right requiring the &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; standard of judicial review, but rather focused on why its previous decision in &quot;Bowers v. Hardwick&quot; had been wrong.

First, the Court stated that its decision in &quot;Bowers&quot; went against its statements in cases involving child-rearing (&quot;Pierce v. Society of Sisters&quot; and &quot;Meyer v. Nebraska&quot;), contraception (&quot;Griswold v. Connecticut&quot; and &quot;Eisenstadt v. Baird&quot;, and abortion (&quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;) that the Constitution protects a right to privacy and personal autonomy. Next, Kennedy wrote that in &quot;Bowers&quot; the Court had misread the historical record regarding laws criminalizing homosexual relations. He stated that, after further research, the Court had found that historical American anti-sodomy laws had been directed at &quot;nonprocreative sexual activity more generally,&quot; rather than specifically at homosexual acts, contrary to the Court&#x27;s conclusions in &quot;Bowers&quot;. Combined with the fact that these laws were often unenforced, the Court saw this as constituting a tradition of avoiding interference with private sexual activity between consenting adults.

Lastly, Kennedy noted that &quot;Bowers&quot; jurisprudential foundation had been weakened by two subsequent cases involving sexuality (&quot;Planned Parenthood v. Casey&quot; and &quot;Romer v. Evans&quot;), and that the reasoning of &quot;Bowers&quot; had been criticized in the United States and rejected by most other developed Western countries. For this reason, Kennedy stated that there was a jurisprudential basis to think that it should be &quot;an integral part of human freedom&quot; for consenting adults to choose to privately engage in sexual activity. 

Kennedy reviewed the assumption the court made in &quot;Bowers&quot;, using the words of Chief Justice Burger&#x27;s concurring opinion in that case, that &quot;Condemnation of [homosexual practices] is firmly rooted in Judeo-Christian moral and ethical standards.&quot; He reviewed the history of legislation that criminalized certain sexual practices, but without regard for the gender of those involved. He cited the Model Penal Code&#x27;s recommendations since 1955, the Wolfenden Report of 1957, and a 1981 decision of the European Court of Human Rights in Case 7525/76 &quot;Dudgeon v United Kingdom&quot;.

=== O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s concurrence ===

Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor only concurred in the judgment and offered a different rationale for invalidating the Texas sodomy statute. She disagreed with the overturning of &quot;Bowers&quot;—she had been in the &quot;Bowers&quot; majority—and disputed the court&#x27;s invocation of due process guarantees of liberty in this context. Rather than including sexuality within protected liberty, she would strike down the law as violating the equal protection clause because it criminalized male–male but not male–female sodomy. O&#x27;Connor maintained that a sodomy law that was neutral both in effect and application might be constitutional, but that there was little to fear because &quot;democratic society&quot; would not tolerate it for long. O&#x27;Connor noted that a law limiting marriage to heterosexual couples would pass rational scrutiny as long as it was designed to &quot;preserv[e] the traditional institution of marriage&quot; and not simply based on the state&#x27;s dislike of homosexual persons.

=== Scalia&#x27;s dissent ===

Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a dissent, which Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Clarence Thomas joined. Scalia objected to the Court&#x27;s decision to revisit &quot;Bowers&quot;, pointing out many decisions from lower courts that relied on &quot;Bowers&quot; that might now need to be reconsidered. He noted that the same rationale used to overturn &quot;Bowers&quot; could have been used to overturn &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, which some of the Justices in the majority in &quot;Lawrence&quot; had upheld in &quot;Planned Parenthood v. Casey&quot; (1992). Scalia also criticized the majority opinion for failing to give the same respect to &quot;stare decisis&quot; that three of those in the majority had insisted on in &quot;Casey&quot;. O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s concurrence noted that Scalia&#x27;s dissent conceded that if cases such as &quot;Romer v. Evans&quot; &quot;have &quot;stare decisis&quot; effect, Texas&#x27; sodomy law would not pass scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause, regardless of the type of rational basis review&quot; applied.

Scalia wrote that if the court was not prepared to validate laws based on moral choices as it had done in &quot;Bowers&quot;, state laws against bigamy, same-sex marriage, adult incest, prostitution, masturbation, adultery, fornication, bestiality, and obscenity would not prove sustainable.

He wrote that:

He cited the majority opinion&#x27;s concern that the criminalization of sodomy could be the basis for discrimination against homosexuals as evidence that the majority ignored the views of most Americans:

He continued: &quot;Let me be clear that I have nothing against homosexuals, or any other group, promoting their agenda through normal democratic means.&quot; The majority&#x27;s &quot;invention of a brand-new &#x27;constitutional right, he wrote, showed it was &quot;impatient of democratic change&quot;.

=== Thomas&#x27;s dissent ===
Justice Thomas wrote in a separate, two-paragraph dissent that the sodomy law the Court struck down was &quot;uncommonly silly&quot;, a phrase drawn from Justice Potter Stewart&#x27;s dissent in &quot;Griswold v. Connecticut&quot;. Justice Thomas added that if he were a member of the Texas Legislature, he would vote to repeal the law. The Justice opined that &quot;punishing someone for expressing his sexual preference through noncommercial consensual conduct with another adult does not appear to be a worthy way to expend valuable law enforcement resources&quot;. Nevertheless, Thomas voted to uphold the constitutionality of the Texas sodomy law because he could find &quot;no general right of privacy&quot; in the Constitution.

== Reactions ==
President George W. Bush&#x27;s press secretary Ari Fleischer refused to comment on the decision, noting only that the administration had not filed a brief in the case. As governor, Bush had opposed the repeal of the Texas sodomy provision, which he called a &quot;symbolic gesture of traditional values&quot;. After quoting Fleischer calling it &quot;a state matter&quot;, Linda Greenhouse, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, commented: &quot;In fact, the decision today ... took what had been a state-by-state matter and pronounced a binding national constitutional principle.&quot;

The Lambda Legal&#x27;s lead attorney in the case, Ruth Harlow, stated in an interview after the ruling that &quot;the court admitted its mistake in 1986, admitted it had been wrong then ... and emphasized today that gay Americans, like all Americans, are entitled to full respect and equal claim to [all] constitutional rights.&quot;

Professor Laurence Tribe has written that &quot;Lawrence&quot; &quot;may well be remembered as the &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; of gay and lesbian America&quot;. Jay Alan Sekulow of the American Center for Law and Justice has referred to the decision as having &quot;changed the status of homosexual acts and changed a previous ruling of the Supreme Court ... this was a drastic rewrite&quot;.

The end result of &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot; was &quot;like the &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; of the homosexual issue&quot;, according to Peter LaBarbera of the Culture and Family Institute and Americans for Truth about Homosexuality, an organization recognized as an anti-gay hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

Then president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, Wilton Gregory, released a statement that the Supreme Court decision was to be deplored.

== Subsequent cases ==

===Sexual privacy===
====Age of consent laws====
&quot;Lawrence&quot; invalidated age of consent laws that differed based on the relative sexes of the partners. The day after the &quot;Lawrence&quot; decision, the Supreme Court ordered the State of Kansas to review its 1999 &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; law that reduces the punishment for a teenager under 18 years of age who has consensual sexual relations with a minor no more than four years their junior but explicitly excludes same-sex conduct from the sentence reduction. In 2004, the Kansas Appeals Court upheld the law as is, but the Kansas Supreme Court unanimously reversed the lower court&#x27;s ruling on October 21, 2005, in &quot;State v. Limon&quot;.

====Consensual incest====
In &quot;Muth v. Frank&quot; (2005), a man convicted of criminal behavior by having an incestuous relationship in Wisconsin appealed his ruling in an attempt to apply the logic of sexual privacy in &quot;Lawrence&quot;. The Seventh Circuit declined to extend the right of privacy stated in &quot;Lawrence&quot; to cases of consensual adult incest. The case was distinguished because the parties were not similarly situated since there is in the latter case an enhanced possibility of genetic mutation of a possible offspring as suggested by geneticists who were witnesses at the trial.

====Fornication====
In &quot;Martin v. Ziherl&quot;, the Supreme Court of Virginia ruled the state&#x27;s fornication law unconstitutional relying on &quot;Lawrence&quot; and the right to privacy.

====Teacher-student relationships====
The Connecticut Supreme Court rejected an argument based on &quot;Lawrence&quot; that a high school teacher had a constitutional right to engage in sexual activity with his consent-aged students. The court rejected the teacher&#x27;s privacy and liberty arguments in the context of an &quot;inherently coercive relationship wherein consent might not easily be refused&quot;.

====Adult entertainment====
Upon rehearing &quot;Williams v. Pryor&quot; after &quot;Lawrence&quot;, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Alabama&#x27;s ban on the sale of sex toys. Facing comparable facts, the Fifth Circuit struck down Texas&#x27;s sex toy ban holding that &quot;morality is an insufficient justification for a statute&quot; and &quot;interests in &#x27;public morality&#x27; cannot constitutionally sustain the statute after &quot;Lawrence&quot;&quot;.

====Bestiality====
Joanna Grossman wrote soon after the decision that &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot; should pose no serious obstacle to bestiality prosecutions, because such laws &quot;plainly can be upheld on a &#x27;cruelty to animals&#x27; justification.&quot; Leighann Lassiter, animal cruelty policy director for the Humane Society of the United States, notes, however, the &quot;Lawrence&quot; ruling may create complications in several states that include human sexual conduct and bestiality in the same &quot;anti-sodomy&quot; statute. As of 2018, 45 states have direct prohibitions on bestiality, while others may prohibit it under broader animal cruelty laws, according to the Animal Legal and Historical Center (Michigan State University College of Law).

==== Prostitution ====
In 2015, the Erotic Service Provider Legal Education &amp; Research Project (ESPLERP) filed a lawsuit against George Gascon, District Attorney for San Francisco, alleging that the state of California&#x27;s anti-prostitution laws prevented relations between consenting adults in violation of &quot;Lawrence&quot;. The District Court dismissed the lawsuit and the Ninth Circuit affirmed the dismissal, reasoning that &quot;the commercial nature of the relationship between prostitute and client suggests a far less selective relationship than that which previously has been held to constitute an intimate association.&quot;

===Same-sex marriage bans===
A few months later, on November 18, 2003, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled that same-sex couples have a right to marry. Although deciding the case on the basis of the state constitution, Chief Justice Margaret Marshall quoted &quot;Lawrence&quot; in its second paragraph: &quot;Our obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code.&quot;

Aside from Massachusetts, other state case law had been quite explicit in limiting the scope of &quot;Lawrence&quot; and upholding state bans on same-sex marriage regulations. (See &quot;Standhardt v. Superior Court ex rel County of Maricopa&quot;, 77 P.3d 451 (Ariz. App. 2003); &quot;Morrison v. Sadler&quot;, 821 N.E.2d 15 (Ind. App. 2005); &quot;Hernandez v Robles&quot; (7 NY3d 338 2005).)

In the first successful federal court challenge to a state same-sex marriage ban, Judge Vaughn Walker cited Scalia&#x27;s dissent in his decision in &quot;Perry v. Schwarzenegger&quot; that found California&#x27;s Proposition 8 banning same-sex marriage unconstitutional.

=== Same-sex adoptive parents ===
In the majority decision, Justice Kennedy wrote: &quot;The present case does not involve minors. It does not involve persons who might be injured or coerced or who are situated in relationships where consent might not easily be refused.&quot; The &quot;obvious&quot; meaning, as Nancy D. Polikoff wrote, was to point out that &quot;Lawrence&quot; could not be used to legalize &quot;sex with children&quot;. Nonetheless, in 2004, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals quoted this sentence when saying that &quot;Lawrence&quot; had not established a right for gay parents to adopt. In an adoption case, the 11th Circuit said, &quot;the involved actors are not only consenting adults, but minors as well...Hence, we conclude that the &quot;Lawrence&quot; decision cannot be extrapolated to create a right to adopt for homosexual persons.&quot;

===United States military===
The United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, the last court of appeals for courts-martial before the Supreme Court, ruled that &quot;Lawrence&quot; applies to Article 125 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the article banning sodomy. Nevertheless, it twice upheld prosecutions under that article when applied as necessary to preserve good order and discipline in the armed forces. Article 125 was repealed by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014.

=== &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot; ===
On June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court overturned &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; (1973) in &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot; and removed the federal protection of the right to abortion, on the grounds that the &quot;right to privacy&quot; does not extend to that of abortion on the criteria from &quot;Washington v. Glucksberg&quot; that a right must be &quot;deeply rooted in the Nation&#x27;s history&quot;, and abortion was considered a crime, a view that some historians argued is incomplete. In the majority opinion, Justice Samuel Alito responded to the dissent opinion&#x27;s concerns, saying that the ruling would not affect other substantive due process cases. In his concurring opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas, wrote, &quot;In future cases, we should reconsider all of this Court&#x27;s substantive due process precedents, including &quot;Griswold&quot;, &quot;Lawrence&quot;, and &quot;Obergefell&quot;. Because any substantive due process decision is &#x27;demonstrably erroneous&#x27; ... we have a duty to &#x27;correct the error&#x27; established in those precedents.&quot; The three cases Thomas mentioned concerned contraception (&quot;Griswold&quot;), sodomy (&quot;Lawrence&quot;), and same-sex marriage (&quot;Obergefell&quot;). respectively. The joint dissenting opinion of Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan, which criticized the majority for rejecting &quot;stare decisis&quot; and overruling precedents dating back to &quot;Griswold&quot;, responded, &quot;Either the majority does not really believe in its own reasoning. Or if it does, all rights that have no history stretching back to the mid-19th century are insecure. Either the mass of the majority&#x27;s opinion is hypocrisy, or additional constitutional rights are under threat. It is one or the other.&quot;

== Level of scrutiny applied in &quot;Lawrence&quot; ==
Justice Scalia and others have noted that the majority did not appear to apply the strict scrutiny standard of review that would be appropriate if the &quot;Lawrence&quot; majority had recognized a full-fledged &quot;fundamental right&quot;. He wrote the majority instead applied &quot;an unheard-of form of rational basis review that will have far-reaching implications beyond this case&quot;.

Nan D. Hunter has argued that &quot;Lawrence&quot; used a new method of substantive due process analysis, and that the Court intended to abandon its old method of categorizing due process rights as either &quot;fundamental&quot; or &quot;not fundamental&quot; as too restrictive. Justice Souter, for example, argued in &quot;Washington v. Glucksberg&quot; that the role of the Court in all cases, including unenumerated rights cases, is to ensure that the government&#x27;s action has not been arbitrary. Justice Stevens had repeatedly criticized tiered scrutiny and preferred a more active judicial balancing test based on reasonability.

Lower courts have read &quot;Lawrence&quot; differently on the question of scrutiny. In &quot;Lofton v. Secretary of the Department of Children and Family Services&quot;, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit upheld a state law barring adoption of children by homosexuals, holding explicitly that &quot;Lawrence&quot; did not apply strict scrutiny. In &quot;Witt v. Department of the Air Force&quot;, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that &quot;Lawrence&quot; applied intermediate scrutiny.

== Plaintiffs ==
In 2000, Robert Eubanks was beaten to death in a case that was never solved. Tyron Garner died of meningitis in 2006, aged 39. John Lawrence died of complications from a heart ailment in 2011, aged 68.

<text>Pekka Halonen (23 September 1865 – 1 December 1933) was a Finnish painter of landscapes and people in the national romantic and Realist styles.

==Biography==

Pekka Halonen was born on 23 September 1865 in Linnasalmi, Lapinlahti, Finland, the son of Olli Halonen, a farmer, and Wilhelmina Halonen (née Uotinen). Halonen&#x27;s father was himself an amateur artist who not only ran the farm, but also worked as a decorative painter on commissions from churches in neighbouring districts. Halonen often accompanied his father on these painting trips and was thus introduced into the craft of painting.

He studied in Helsinki at the Art Society&#x27;s Drawing School for four years. He graduated with good grades and won a scholarship to study abroad. He went in 1890 to Paris, where he first studied at the Academie Julian and later under Paul Gauguin. He also studied at the Académie Vitti in Paris.

In 1896, he travelled to Florence, Siena, Rome and Naples to study early Renaissance art. In 1900, Halonen created two works for the Finnish Pavilion at the Exposition Universelle in Paris. In 1904, he traveled to Vienna to Florence by way of St. Petersburg.

In 1895, Pekka Halonen married a young music student, Maija Mäkinen. They had eight children: four sons and four daughters. Halonen died in Tuusula on 1 December 1933. He was buried at the Tuusula Church in Tuusula.

==Style==
Halonen chronicled the Finnish landscape and its people. He had an early interest in Symbolism, but Gauguin&#x27;s decorative Synthetism, as well as Japanese woodcuts, had a deeper impression on his work.

Many of his paintings depict simple scenes from his everyday surroundings, such as &quot;Sauna in the Snow&quot; (1908), which vividly captures the stillness and subtle fragrance of freshly fallen snow. When at the beginning of the 20th century Finland&#x27;s existence was threatened, Halonen strove to foster a sense of national pride through symbolic interpretations of the Finnish landscape.

Halonen stated that he never painted for anyone but himself. He felt that &quot;Art should not jar the nerves like sandpaper – it should produce a feeling of peace.&quot;

==Halosenniemi==
In 1895, Halonen and his family settled down in a house with a studio on Lake Tuusula in Tuusula, Finland. Here the Halonen family lived in an imposing pinewood villa known as ‘Halosenniemi’. Halosenniemi was designed by Pekka Halonen himself and his brother Antti Halonen and was completed during the winter of 1901–02. Adjacent to the house, Halonen built a sauna, which in typical Finnish tradition also served as a laundry. The landscape near Halosenniemi was an important source of inspiration for his art. In Tuusula Halonen had a wide circle of artist friends and relatives which provided him with a daily source of social and cultural stimulation.

On the shores of the lake where he resided an artists&#x27; community flourished, helping to develop a sense of Finnish national identity. Halosenniemi was designed with the two-storey studios of Paris in mind, with high ceilings and tall windows in the studio, and second-floor living-quarters accessible by a set of stairs and a balcony that overlooked the studio.

The building is now a museum that includes original furnishings and Halonen&#x27;s own art.
