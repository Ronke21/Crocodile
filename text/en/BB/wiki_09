<text>The Cotton Bowl Classic (also known as the Cotton Bowl) is an American college football bowl game played annually in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex since January 1, 1937. 

The game was originally played at its namesake stadium in Dallas before moving to AT&amp;T Stadium in nearby Arlington in 2010. Since 2014, the game has been sponsored by the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company and officially known as the Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic; it was previously sponsored by Mobil (1989–1995) and Southwestern Bell Corporation/SBC Communications/AT&amp;T (1997–2014).

From 1941 to 1995, the game hosted the champion of the Southwest Conference (SWC) against a team invited from elsewhere in the country, frequently a major independent or a runner-up from the Southeastern Conference (SEC). Following the dissolution of the SWC in 1996, the game hosted a runner-up from the Big 12 Conference, facing an SEC team from 1999 to 2014.

In 2014, the Cotton Bowl Classic, along with the &quot;New Year&#x27;s Six&quot; bowls, became a part of the College Football Playoff. As part of the four team playoff from 2014 to 2023, the Cotton Bowl served as a semifinal game in 2015, 2018, and 2021.

With the expansion of the College Football Playoff to twelve teams in the 2024–25 season, the Cotton Bowl Classic will serve as either a quarterfinal or semifinal each year. It served as a semifinal in 2025 and will serve as a quarterfinal in 2026. When serving as a semifinal, the game will be played one week after New Year&#x27;s Day. 

The winner of the Cotton Bowl is awarded the Field Scovell Trophy.

==History==
===1930s===

The Cotton Bowl Classic was founded in Dallas in 1937 at the Texas State Fair Grounds, when Texas oil executive J. Curtis Sanford financed the first bowl game. Texas Christian and star quarterback Sammy Baugh took on Marquette, winning 16–6, but the game lost money even though some 17,000 attended. Nonetheless, Sanford persevered, and in 1938 the game made a profit as Rice defeated Byron White&#x27;s Colorado 28–14 in front of a crowd of 37,000.

Some 40,000 attended the 1939 match between Saint Mary&#x27;s College of California and Texas Tech, with the Gaels upsetting the undefeated Red Raiders 20–13.

===1940s===
In 1940, an underdog Clemson team surprised the Boston College Eagles 6–3, in the first and only appearance at the Cotton Bowl Classic by Tigers coach Frank Howard. Attendance at this game was given as 20,000. Later that year, a group of prominent Dallas citizens took over the staging of the game as the Cotton Bowl Athletic Association. A few months later, the CBAA became an agency of the Southwest Conference. From 1941 to 1994, the SWC&#x27;s champion hosted the Cotton Bowl Classic.

In 1943, The Texas Longhorns represented the SWC in their first ever bowl game against a highly ranked Georgia Tech team at the time. Prior to the game, sportswriters boasted that Texas did not belong in the same league as Georgia Tech. Texas proved the public wrong by defeating the Yellow Jackets 14–7 in what was mostly a defensive battle. This Cotton Bowl was the first bowl appearance for Texas as the Longhorns would go on to appear in a record 22 Cotton Bowls, the most of any team.

In 1946, Missouri was defeated by Texas, despite the 4th quarter work of freshman fullback Robert (Bob) Lee Clodfelter, who was to mature under Weeb Ewbank at Washington University in St. Louis the next three years.

In 1947 LSU and Arkansas played in front of 38,000 people to a scoreless tie in what would later become known as the &quot;Ice Bowl.&quot; LSU got the better of Arkansas most of the game, but the game truly belonged to the weatherman.

In 1948 Penn State, in a bowl game for the first time in 25 years, played Dallas&#x27; SMU to a 13–13 tie. Because none of the Dallas hotels would provide accommodations for the two African-American members of the Penn State team, the Penn State team ended up staying at a Naval Air Station 14 miles from Dallas. This was the first interracial game played at the Cotton Bowl Stadium.

===1950s===
The 1953 Cotton Bowl would be a rematch of the 1951 bowl game as Texas and Tennessee played for the second time. Texas defensive stars shut out the Vols 16–0 as the Longhorns avenged the previous meeting when Tennessee beat Texas 20–14.

The 1954 Cotton Bowl Classic featured one of the most famous plays in college football history. Rice&#x27;s Dickey Moegle (last name spelling later changed to &quot;Maegle&quot;) began a run around end from his team&#x27;s 5-yard line and down the open field. Alabama&#x27;s Tommy Lewis jumped off the bench and tackled Moegle. The referee, Cliff Shaw, saw what happened and signaled touchdown even though Moegle was &quot;tackled&quot; at the 42-yard line.

The 1957 Classic matched the TCU Horned Frogs against the Jim Brown-led Syracuse Orangemen. Brown rushed for 135 yards, scored three touchdowns and kicked three extra points but a fourth-quarter blocked extra point by TCU&#x27;s Chico Mendoza proved the margin of victory as TCU won, 28–27. TCU QB Chuck Curtis passed for 174 yards, threw for two touchdowns and rushed for another to lead the Frogs.

===1960s===
In 1960, Syracuse defeated Texas 23–14 to win the national championship. Syracuse was led by bowl MVP Ernie Davis, who ran for one touchdown, caught a Cotton Bowl Classic record 87-yard touchdown, and intercepted a pass leading to a third touchdown. There was a brawl on the field just before the end of the first half; some said it was because of Texas taking cheap shots at Ernie Davis. The University of Texas president Logan Wilson called for an NCAA hearing on the fight after the game. Syracuse Athletic Director Lew Andreas asserted that no one from his university had accused Texas of dirty play, and attributed those claims to members of the media. The issue was dropped shortly thereafter. In 1961, Davis became the first black athlete to win the Heisman Trophy, but died of leukemia before his pro career could begin.

Duke defeated Arkansas 7–6 in the 1961 game. Duke scored with 2:45 remaining and recovered a fumble on the ensuing series to win the game.

In 1962, Texas would again be selected to play in the Cotton Bowl after winning another SWC crown. This time the Longhorns faced a highly talented Mississippi Rebels team. The game was a low scoring meeting that came down to the final quarter as Texas won 12–7.

The 1963 game featured the returning Texas Longhorns and the LSU Tigers, who, like Mississippi, were from the SEC. Lynn Amedee&#x27;s 23-yard field goal gave the Tigers a 3–0 halftime lead after Texas had missed their own which led to an 80-yard drive. This was the first field goal in the Classic since 1942. Amedee recovered a Longhorn fumble at the 37 early in the third quarter and Jimmy Field scored 5 plays later on a touchdown run. Buddy Hamic recovered a Longhorn fumble to set up an Amedee field goal 13 plays later as the Tigers shut the Longhorns out.

In 1964, No. 1 Texas completed an undefeated season by defeating No. 2 Navy (led by Heisman Trophy winner and future Dallas Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach). The game was played six weeks after the assassination of John F. Kennedy (coincidentally, a retired Naval officer) in Dallas. The 1964 game is the second bowl game in college football history to pair the No. 1 and No. 2 teams in the nation (the 1963 Rose Bowl being the first).

In 1965, the Arkansas Razorbacks took an undefeated record (10–0) into the Classic versus a 9–1 Nebraska Cornhuskers team. Although Alabama had been awarded the AP and UPI (Coaches) polls national titles before the bowl games (which was standard at that time), Arkansas still had a chance to claim a share of the national championship with a victory over Nebraska. After a hard-fought defensive battle, the Hogs prevailed 10–7. That victory, coupled with an Alabama loss in the Orange Bowl to Texas (a team Arkansas defeated in Austin, Texas.), gave Arkansas the Grantland Rice Trophy emblematic of the national championship awarded by the Football Writers Association of America (FWAA).

In the 1966 game, Arkansas put its 22-game winning streak at risk playing LSU, who defeated the Razorbacks, 14–7.

The 1967 game was moved to Saturday, December 31, 1966, due to the Dallas Cowboys hosting the NFL Championship Game at the stadium on New Year&#x27;s Day, a Sunday. The other major bowl games that year—the Rose Bowl, Sugar Bowl, and Orange Bowl—were played on Monday, January 2.

The 1968 game saw SWC champs Texas A&amp;M, led by coach Gene Stallings defeat former A&amp;M head coach Bear Bryant and the Alabama Crimson Tide. Stallings was one of Bryant&#x27;s &quot;Junction Boys&quot; as well as a former assistant, and would eventually go on to coach the Tide. After the Aggies defeated the Tide 20–16, Bryant embraced Stallings and carried him off the field.

In 1969, Texas was off and running with its new offensive formation, the Wishbone. After dismantling all opponents of the 1968 season, Texas won the SWC crown again and this time faced the Tennessee Volunteers, in what was a lopsided win for Texas with almost 400 rushing yards. Texas won 36–13.

===1970s===
The 1970 game featured Notre Dame&#x27;s return to bowl games after a 45-year self-imposed ban. When the Irish made that decision, 9–1 LSU was overlooked for the game, and the Tigers stayed home instead. The Irish, led by quarterback Joe Theismann, faced top-ranked and undefeated Texas. Notre Dame led 17–14 late in the fourth quarter, but the Longhorns scored a late touchdown to clinch a 21–17 victory and an undisputed national championship. The same two teams met the next year, but this time, the Irish ended the Longhorns&#x27; 30-game winning streak with a 24–11 victory, denying Texas the Associated Press national championship (the Longhorns had already clinched the regular season championship in the UPI poll, a pre-bowl poll until the 1974 season; Nebraska won the AP title). Texas and Notre Dame met again in the 1978 game, with the Longhorns again top-ranked, only to see the Irish and quarterback Joe Montana roll to a 38–10 victory. The Irish vaulted from fifth to first in the final polls with the victory.

The 1973 game featured Texas and Alabama once again playing in a bowl game. Alabama led 13–10 going into the 4th quarter when Texas quarterback, Alan Lowry, ran the bootleg to perfection and scrambled 32 yards for the go-ahead touchdown. Again, Texas defeated Alabama and Bear Bryant, 17–13.

The 1976 Cotton Bowl showcased SWC co-Champ Arkansas against SEC stalwart Georgia. The Razorbacks had beaten No. 2 Texas A&amp;M in a blowout to force a tie for the conference crown, and opened the door for Arkansas to stroll to Dallas on New Year&#x27;s Day. After the Bulldogs jumped out to a 10–0 lead, the Hogs came roaring back, scoring 31 unanswered points, and defeating Georgia, 31–10. Arkansas finished the season 10–2.

The 1977 Cotton Bowl featured SWC Champions Houston Cougars, who were entering the Cotton Bowl for the first time, against the undefeated Maryland Terrapins. Houston won 30–21, handing the Terps their only loss of the year.

The 1979 Cotton Bowl Classic, nicknamed the Chicken Soup Game, featured one of the most historic comebacks in bowl history. Notre Dame trailed Houston 34–12 midway through the fourth quarter. Thanks to a blocked punt and the brilliance of future NFL Hall of Famer Joe Montana, the Irish rallied to win 35–34, their second consecutive Cotton Bowl Classic victory.

===1980s===
The 1982 game between Texas and Alabama would be the final time that Bear Bryant would face the Longhorns. Having lost to Texas in all meetings prior, Alabama went into the fourth quarter ahead 10–0 and it would appear that the Bear would finally get a win over Texas while at Alabama. But the Longhorns scored their first points with a quarterback draw by Robert Brewer on a 3rd-and-long with 10:38 remaining. On Texas&#x27; next possession, Terry Orr scored from eight yards out to cap an 11-play, 80-yard drive to put the Longhorns up 14–10 with 2:05 remaining. Alabama&#x27;s Joey Jones returned the ensuing kickoff to the Texas 38-yard line, and Tide quarterback Walter Lewis took over with 1:54 left. On the very next play, UT&#x27;s William Graham picked off a Lewis pass at the one. The Longhorns took a safety to insure better field position and Texas once again stunned Alabama and the Bear with a 14–12 victory.

The 1984 game featured No. 7 Georgia of the SEC against undefeated No. 2 Texas of the SWC. Texas led 9–3 with more than four minutes to play in a battle of field goals between Georgia&#x27;s Kevin Butler and Texas&#x27; Jeff Ward. A Chip Andrews (Georgia) punt was muffed by Texas defensive back Craig Curry late in the fourth quarter, then Georgia quarterback John Lastinger ran 17 yards for a touchdown with 3:22 left to play to capture a 10–9 victory, costing the Longhorns a possible national title.

The 1989 game between UCLA and Arkansas was highly publicized in the Dallas area because Bruin quarterback Troy Aikman was expected to be the top pick in the 1989 NFL draft; the first pick was held by the Dallas Cowboys. Much was made of Cowboys longtime head coach Tom Landry watching Aikman practice at Texas Stadium, UCLA&#x27;s practice facility for game preparation. Landry never got to draft Aikman, because he was fired the next month, but his successor, Jimmy Johnson, did. UCLA and Aikman won, 17–3.

The Cotton Bowl Classic has seen its share of great quarterbacks. Sammy Baugh, Davey O&#x27;Brien, Babe Parilli, Bobby Layne, Norm Van Brocklin, Y. A. Tittle, Bart Starr, Roger Staubach, Ken Stabler, Joe Theismann, Joe Montana, Dan Marino, Doug Flutie, Troy Aikman, and Eli Manning all have played in the game.

Three of the four Heisman Trophy winners from the 1984–87 seasons finished their college career in the Cotton Bowl Classic: Doug Flutie for Boston College in January 1985, Bo Jackson of Auburn in 1986, and Tim Brown of Notre Dame in 1988.

Brown and fellow Heisman winner Davey O&#x27;Brien, who played in the 1937 Cotton Bowl, both attended nearby Woodrow Wilson High School in the Lakewood area. &quot;Woodrow&quot; became the first high school ever to produce two Heisman winners.

===1990s===
For 53 years, the SWC champion played as the home team in the Cotton Bowl Classic, a tie-in which continued through the 1994 season. Until the mid-1980s, the contest was almost universally counted as a major New Year&#x27;s Day bowl. However, by the late 1980s, the Cotton Bowl Classic&#x27;s prestige had fallen significantly. During the 1980s, many SWC teams were left ineligible for postseason play due to NCAA probations for rule violations. Also, the conference&#x27;s quality of play suffered a marked decline. The SWC champion lost the last seven times in which it received an automatic bid to the game, and the last national champion for almost four decades to play in the Cotton Bowl Classic was Notre Dame in 1977 (eventual national champions Alabama and Clemson would later play in the Cotton Bowl after the 2015 and 2018 seasons, respectively). Finally, the Cotton Bowl Classic was played outdoors during cold weather on occasion (most notably the 1979 game).

Meanwhile, the Fiesta Bowl, unhindered by conference tie-ins and played in generally warm weather, propelled itself to major-bowl status by attracting national championship contenders, most notably with its January 1987 matchup between Penn State and Miami. In the minds of many fans, the Fiesta replaced the Cotton as a major bowl. Despite this, the Cotton Bowl Classic still retained enough prestige that it was included as one of the top bowls in the Bowl Coalition when it was formed in 1992. However, in 1995, the new Bowl Alliance (the predecessor of the BCS) chose to include the Fiesta over the Cotton in its rotation. While it was still capable of landing Top 10 teams, it was no longer in a position to decide the national championship. In 18 of the 21 seasons since 1995, the Cotton Bowl has featured two ranked opponents. In the other three seasons, one of the teams was ranked (2002, 2003, and 2010).

In 1995, the SWC gave up control of the Cotton Bowl Classic as part of its planned dissolution after the season. From 1999 to 2014, the Cotton Bowl Classic had the second pick from the Big 12 after the Bowl Alliance and its successor, the Bowl Championship Series–usually the championship game loser or a division runner-up.

From 1996 to 1998, the other participant was either the champion of the Western Athletic Conference or the runner-up of the Pac-10 Conference. In 1996, the No. 5 BYU Cougars joined Notre Dame as the only programs outside of a major conference to play in the Cotton Bowl in the modern era, defeating the Kansas State Wildcats 19–15, winning an NCAA record 14th game, and finishing the season ranked fifth in the country with a 14–1 record.

In 1999, the Cotton Bowl arranged for a team from the Southeastern Conference to be the Big 12 opponent, and Southwestern Bell (now AT&amp;T) began sponsoring the event. More often than not, the SEC representative was the runner-up from the West Division. However, Tennessee appeared in 2001 and 2005, and Missouri appeared in 2014.

===2000s===
Through 2008, the Cotton Bowl Classic continued to be played on New Year&#x27;s Day (except in 2004 and 2006, when the game was moved to January 2) and was usually the second game of the day to kick off, generally following the Outback Bowl.

This decade was kicked off in grand fashion, as two former Southwest Conference rivals faced off in the 2000 Classic. The Arkansas Razorbacks, now a member of the SEC (), and Texas Longhorns, now a member of the Big XII () faced off in the first college football game of the last year of the 20th Century. After a lackluster first half ended with the game tied 3–3, the Razorbacks opened things up, led by Offensive MVP running back Cedric Cobbs. Arkansas beat their former hated rival, 27–6, holding the Longhorns to negative yards rushing, and sacking the Texas QB a bowl-record 8 times.

The 2003 Cotton Bowl Classic saw a rematch between the Texas Longhorns and the LSU Tigers. LSU led at the half 17–7 however Roy Williams of Texas had a tremendous breakout in the second half to lead Texas to victory over the Tigers, 35–20.
The 2004 Cotton Bowl Classic saw the return of the Mississippi Rebels, whose last appearance in the Cotton Bowl Classic was a 12–7 loss to Texas in 1962. The 2004 Cotton Bowl Classic would also be New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning&#x27;s last college football game. Manning led his team to beat Oklahoma State 31–28.

The 2007 Cotton Bowl Classic was between Auburn Tigers and the Nebraska Cornhuskers; Auburn won 17–14.

In the 2008 Cotton Bowl Classic, Missouri&#x27;s running back Tony Temple broke the bowl game rushing record by gaining 281 yards on 24 carries. (The record was previously held by Rice&#x27;s Dickey Maegle, who had rushed for 265 yards.) Missouri beat Arkansas 38–7.
In April 2008, Cotton Bowl Classic officials announced that in 2009 and 2010 the game would be moved from its traditional start time of 10 a.m. CST on January 1 to 1 p.m. CST on January 2.
In the final Cotton Bowl Classic game to be held in the Cotton Bowl stadium, the 8–4, No. 20 Ole Miss Rebels defeated the 11–1, No. 7 Texas Tech Red Raiders, 47–34. Tech quarterback Graham Harrell broke the NCAA record in this game for most touchdown passes thrown by anyone in Cotton Bowl Classic history.

===2010s===
In 2010, the Cotton Bowl Classic moved to the new Cowboys Stadium (now AT&amp;T Stadium) in Arlington, as part of a bid by bowl officials to make it part of the BCS in 2011. The Cotton Bowl had recently been remodeled and expanded to over 92,000 seats as part of a long-term drive to regain major status for the bowl game. However, Dallas&#x27; frequently cold January weather had been a longstanding concern, and was thought to have hampered any prospect of upgrading the game to the BCS. In contrast, the new stadium would offer top amenities and a retractable roof. A new four-year agreement between the BCS and ESPN had forestalled any possibility of the Cotton Bowl Classic joining the BCS until 2015 at the earliest. Later findings that the Fiesta Bowl reimbursed employees more than $46,000 for political contributions could have opened the door for the Cotton Bowl to replace the Fiesta in the BCS bowl rotation; however, the Fiesta Bowl did not lose its BCS rotation.

In the 2010 Cotton Bowl Classic played between the Oklahoma State Cowboys and the Ole Miss Rebels at the new Cowboys Stadium, the Rebels shut down the high scoring Cowboys offense to win the 74th annual Cotton Bowl Classic 21–7.

In 2010, the Cotton Bowl celebrated its 75th anniversary with a new logo dedicated to the yearlong celebration. Texas A&amp;M played Louisiana State University in the 2011 AT&amp;T Cotton Bowl Classic on January 7, 2011. LSU would beat Texas A&amp;M 41–24. This was the first Cotton Bowl Classic to be played in prime time, as well as the latest calendar date for the game.

In the 2012 match-up, the Arkansas Razorbacks defeated the Kansas State Wildcats 29–16. It was a BCS-worthy game, featuring two Top 10 teams. The game was highlighted by Razorback Joe Adams punt return of 51 yards for a touchdown in the second quarter, to give Arkansas early command. It was the first punt returned for a touchdown in the Cotton Bowl Classic since former Razorback Lance Alworth did it in 1961. After the Hogs posted 19 unanswered points, Kansas State responded with 16 consecutive points of their own in the second and third quarters. But the Razorbacks pulled away late in the third quarter and early fourth quarter, led by quarterback Tyler Wilson, the game&#x27;s offensive MVP. Arkansas improved to 11–2 for the 2011 season, and finished ranked No. 5, while K-State fell to 10–3.

In 2013, the No. 10 Texas A&amp;M Aggies defeated the No. 12 Oklahoma Sooners 41–13 to win the Cotton Bowl Classic and to finish the season with an 11–2 record. Johnny Manziel rushed for 229 yards during the game, a Cotton Bowl record, rushing for two touchdowns and throwing for two more. Though the halftime score was 14–13 Texas A&amp;M, the Aggies went on to score 27 unanswered second half points to win the game.

The Cotton Bowl Classic returned to &quot;major&quot; bowl status in the 2014 season in conjunction with the first year of the new College Football Playoff. It will host a national semifinal once every three years (in the 2015, 2018, 2021, 2024 seasons), and in other years will host two at-large teams that did not get selected to the four-team playoff. As part of this move, television rights switched to ESPN, which also televises other games in the playoff system. The January 2015 game featured two team ranked in the top ten for the first time in 20 seasons; the No. 8 Michigan State Spartans of the Big Ten Conference and the No. 5 Baylor Bears of the Big 12 Conference. The Spartans beat the Bears by a score of 42–41 to claim the school&#x27;s first-ever Cotton Bowl Classic championship. The 2017 game saw the No. 15 Western Michigan Broncos of the Mid-American Conference (MAC) meet the No. 9 Wisconsin Badgers of the Big Ten Conference. The Badgers beat the previously undefeated Broncos, 24–16. The Broncos were the first team from the MAC to participate in the Cotton Bowl Classic.

==Sponsorship==
From 1989 until 1995, the game was sponsored by Mobil Oil and known as the Mobil Cotton Bowl Classic. From 1996 to 2013, the game was sponsored by Southwestern Bell Corporation; however, it went through several name changes, first in 2000 when the firm adopted a standardized &quot;SBC&quot; branding reflecting its name it adopted in 1995, SBC Communications, and since 2006, after their acquisition of AT&amp;T Corporation, and its subsequent name change to AT&amp;T Inc., as the AT&amp;T Cotton Bowl Classic.

On October 15, 2014, ESPN.com reported that AT&amp;T would no longer sponsor the Cotton Bowl since it already holds the naming rights to the stadium in which it is played. On November 7, 2014, it was announced that Goodyear would become the new sponsor of the game, now known for sponsorship reasons as the Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic.

===Cotton Bowl===

The Cotton Bowl is a stadium which opened in 1930 and became known as &quot;The House That Doak Built&quot; due to the immense crowds that former SMU running back Doak Walker drew to the stadium during his college career in the late 1940s. Originally known as the Fair Park Bowl, it is located in Fair Park, site of the State Fair of Texas. The Cotton Bowl Classic called its namesake home since the bowl&#x27;s inception in 1937 until the 2010 game. The NFL&#x27;s Dallas Cowboys called the Cotton Bowl home for 11 years, from the team&#x27;s formation in 1960 until 1971, when the Cowboys moved to Texas Stadium.
Although not the first established bowl game, the Cotton Bowl is a play on the phrase &quot;cotton boll.&quot; Texas is the leading producer of cotton in the United States.

===AT&amp;T Stadium===

AT&amp;T Stadium, formerly Cowboys Stadium, is a domed stadium with a retractable roof in Arlington, Texas. After failed negotiations to return the Cowboys to the Cotton Bowl, Jerry Jones along with the city of Arlington, Texas funded the stadium at a cost of $1.15 billion. It was completed on May 29, 2009, and seats 80,000, but is expandable to seat up to 100,000. AT&amp;T Stadium is the largest domed stadium in the world.

A highlight of AT&amp;T Stadium is its center-hung high-definition television screen, the second largest in the world. The , scoreboard surpasses the screen that opened in 2009 at the renovated Kauffman Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri.

<doc id="227252" wikidata="Q5422524" url="?curid=227252" title="Exxon Corp v Exxon Insurance Consultants International Ltd">
<text>Exxon Corp. v. Exxon Insurance Consultants International Ltd [1982] Ch. 119 is a leading decision in English law on the existence of copyright in a name alone and the infringement of a trade mark. The Court found that typically there is no copyright in a name, invented or otherwise, and that a trade mark can only be infringed when the infringing party shares part of the market segment.

The Plaintiff, Exxon Corp, had claimed the copyright of the word and went on to file an injunction to stop the defendant company from using the word &#x27;Exxon&#x27;, under Exxon&#x27;s copyright claim to its own name under English Copyright law, protecting &#x27;original literary works&#x27; and further asked the defendant company to remove the word from the company name. However, Judge Oliver decided to not grant the injunction to an infringement of copyright and noted that the word did not qualify for copyright protection as an ′original literary work′. This is because it conveyed no information, provides no instruction nor pleasure and is furthermore merely a combination of letters from the alphabet.

Judge Graham quoted &#x27;&quot;if the plaintiffs&#x27; argument is right ... the consequences would be far-reaching and probably in many cases objectionable&#x27;. On appeal it was further emphasised by Lord Justice Stevenson that &#x27;I am not sure whether this [&quot;Exxon&quot;] can be said to be a &quot;work&quot; at all; I am clearly of the opinion that it cannot be said to be a &#x27;literary work&#x27;.

==Trade mark==
With regard to the trade mark, the Court found that the use of this word by the defendants, who work in a field that in no way shares a market segment with the plaintiff, in no way dilutes the plaintiff&#x27;s brand name nor infringes on its trade mark.

<doc id="227257" wikidata="Q7314877" url="?curid=227257" title="Requisite organization">
<text>Requisite organization (RO) is a term and methodology developed by Elliott Jaques and Kathryn Cason as a result of the research in stratified systems theory, general theory of bureaucracy, work complexity and human capability over 60 years.

Requisite organization is the system of business organization that aims for effective managerial organization and managerial leadership, based on the systematic application of scientific research about the nature of work and the nature of individual&#x27;s capacity for work.

== Definition ==
According to Jaques, &quot;the term requisite organization means doing business with efficiency and competitiveness, and the release of human imagination, trust, and satisfaction in work.&quot;

Requisite organization is a system designed to get work done with effectiveness in producing valued goods and services to satisfy public needs and at the same time achieving the positive bottom line for the business by means of specialization of functions within vertical stratified and hierarchical organization that is referred to by Jaques as Managerial Accountability Hierarchy:
* Work outputs are continuously produced by process movement across vertical functions of work.
* Work and accountability for bottom line achievement cascade down successive levels and strata and a system of organizational layers or strata of bottom line generation units is formed.
* Managers hold immediate subordinates accountable for their own personal effectiveness in getting work done and for the output of their subordinates. 
Requisite organization is a triple bottom line management methodology which uncovers dysfunctional aspects of strategy, systems&quot;,&quot; structures&quot;,&quot; and staff and then realigns them to fit the required complexity of the business, with the purpose to increase and sustain maximum economic value.

== Business complexity ==
Companies differ in the values they provide to their societies and the complexity of the business as employment systems they create to deliver those values with the purpose of growing and maintaining their bottom line.

According to requisite organization approach, the higher the complexity (quality and quantity) of a value that a company delivers to the society is, the higher the level of business complexity the company needs to create and maintain to deliver the value to the society effectively:
* If the level of the value delivered to the society is lower than the complexity of the business, then there is a probability that the company will struggle to achieve the positive bottom line by maintaining the higher business complexity than is justified by the society.
* If the level of the value delivered to the society is higher than the complexity of the business, then there is a probability that the quality and quantity and timeliness of the value delivered by the company to the society will be short of the society&#x27;s expectations and, as a result, the company will be able to maintain the positive bottom line only over a short-term period – poor business sustainability.
An identification of the level of business complexity for the company is the foundation of requisite organization as all the other Requisite dimensions (Strategy, Systems, Structure, Staff) are aligned to the level of business complexity.

In Requisite Organization, companies are classified into eight levels of business complexity based on such criteria as type of value chain (single or multiple), geography of assets (local, regional, national, international, global), operating revenue, etc.

For example, for a Level 6 International Company with single value chain in multiple countries the following stratified hierarchy of bottom line units may be considered optimal in Requisite Organization:
* Stratum VI Corporate Bottom Line Unit
* Stratum V Business Bottom Line Unit
* Stratum IV Production Bottom Line Unit
* Stratum III Operating or Mutual Recognition Unit Bottom Line Unit
* Stratum II Output Teams or First Line Mutual Knowledge Bottom Line Unit
* Stratum I Direct Output Employees as accountable Stratum I Bottom Line Unit that underpins the key idea of Requisite Organization that every employee contributes to the business bottom line and the importance for an employee to work at their full potential.

==Requisite Organization International Institute==
The Requisite Organization International Institute (US) was founded in 1999 by Jaques and Cason to continue development and expansion of research on the application of requisite organization. Jacques&#x27; tenth book,&quot; A General Theory of Bureaucracy&quot; (1976) integrates 25 years of basic science research underpinning stratified system theory. Another 27 years of research and 11 books reporting the findings made by Jacques and colleagues forms the foundation of the institute&#x27;s research and development.

<doc id="227261" wikidata="Q15281711" url="?curid=227261" title="Japanese missions to Imperial China">
<text>The Japanese missions to Imperial China were diplomatic which were intermittently sent to the Chinese imperial court. Any distinction amongst diplomatic envoys sent from the Japanese court or from any of the Japanese shogunates was lost or rendered moot when the ambassador was received in the Chinese capital.

Extant records document missions to China between the years of 607 and 839 (a mission planned for 894 was cancelled). The composition of these imperial missions included members of the aristocratic &quot;kuge&quot; and Buddhist monks. These missions led to the importation of Chinese culture, including advances in the sciences and technology. These diplomatic encounters produced the beginnings of a range of schools of Buddhism in Japan, including Zen.

From the Sinocentric perspective of the Chinese court in Chang&#x27;an, the several embassies sent from Kyoto were construed as tributaries of Imperial China; but it is not clear that the Japanese shared this view.

China seems to have taken the initiative in opening relations with Japan. The Emperor Yang of Sui dispatched a message in 605 which read:

The sovereign of Sui respectfully inquires about the sovereign of Wa.

The court of Empress Suiko responded by sponsoring a mission led by Ono no Imoko in 607. A message carried by that mission, believed to have been written by Prince Shōtoku, contains the earliest known written instance in which the Japanese archipelago is referred to by a term meaning &quot;land of the rising sun.&quot; The salutation read, in part:

From the sovereign of the land of the rising sun (&quot;hi izuru tokoro&quot;) to the sovereign of the land of the setting sun.&quot;

The included representatives sent to study government and technology.

The are the best known; 19 missions were completed. A 20th mission had been planned for 894 (&quot;Kanpyō 6, 8th month&quot;), including the appointment of ambassadors. However, shortly before departure, the mission was halted by Emperor Uda because of reports of unsettled conditions in China. The emperor&#x27;s decision-making was influenced by the persuasive counsel of Sugawara no Michizane.

==Envoys to the Sui court==
Japanese envoys to the Sui court were received as ambassadors:

*607: The first diplomatic mission was led by Japan&#x27;s first ambassador to China. This Japanese envoy, Ono no Imoko, had the title &quot;kenzuishi&quot;. The delegation was received in the Imperial Court.
*608: Ono no Imoko leads a returning embassy to China. This mission included two others with the title &quot;kenzushi&quot;: Takamuko no Kuromaro (no Genri) and Minabuchi no Shōan. Kuromaro and Shōan, along with the Buddhist monk Sōmin remained in China for 32 years before returning to Japan.

==Envoys to the Tang court==
Japanese envoys to the Tang court were received as ambassadors:
Three missions to the Tang court were dispatched during the reign of Emperor Kōtoku.
Emperor Kanmu&#x27;s planned mission to the Tang court in 804 (&quot;Enryaku 23&quot;) included three ambassadors and several Buddhist priests, including and ; but the enterprise was delayed until the end of the year. The ambassadors returned in the middle of 805 (&quot;Enryaku 24, 6th month&quot;). They were accompanied by the monk Saichō, also known by his posthumous name , whose teachings would develop into the Tendai school of Japanese Buddhism. In 806 (&quot;Daidō 1, 8th month&quot;), the return of the monk Kūkai, also known posthumously as , marks the beginning of what would develop into the Shingon school of Japanese Buddhism.

New ambassadors to China were appointed by Emperor Ninmyō in 834, but the mission was put off. 
*836–839: The mission was postponed by a typhoon; but the ambassadors did eventually travel to the Tang court, returning in 839 with a letter from Emperor Tang Wenzong.

In China, a steady and conservative Confucianist Song dynasty emerged after the end of the Tang dynasty and subsequent period of disunity during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. During this time, although travel to China was generally safe, Japanese rulers believed there was little to learn from the Song, and so there were no major embassy missions to China.

===Adopting Tang models===
Ancient Japan was called Wa, which had a primitive culture when compared to Tang culture. The Tang folks referred to Wa as 東夷 (Eastern barbarians).

From 630 onward, Wa sent large groups of monks, students and government officials, up to 600 each time, to the Tang capital of Chang&#x27;an to learn the then advanced production technology, social system, history, philosophy, arts and architecture.
Among many items adopted by Wa:

*Tang political system
*Heian-kyō, the new Japanese capital established in 794, and was a laid out in a grid similar to that of Chang&#x27;an, the Tang capital.
*Culture, many Han Chinese characters (漢字) were borrowed from Tang civilization to build the Japanese culture.
*Tang dress codes (known today as Wafuku 和服), eating habits were the fashion which was imitated and popularized.

==Envoys to the Ming court==
Japanese envoys to the Ming court were received as ambassadors.

*1373-1406 (&quot;Ōan 6&quot; – &quot;Ōei 13&quot;): Embassies between China and Japan.
*1397 (&quot;Ōei 4, 8th month&quot;): an Imperial ambassador is dispatched from Emperor Go-Komatsu to the Ming Court.
*1401 (&quot;Ōei 8&quot;): Ashikaga Yoshimitsu sends a diplomatic mission to China as a tentative first step in re-initiating trade between Japan and Ming China. The formal diplomatic letter conveyed to the Emperor of China was accompanied by a gift of 1000 ounces of gold and diverse objects.
*1402 (&quot;Ōei 9&quot;): A letter from the Jianwen Emperor of China was received by Yoshimitsu; and this formal communication mistakenly accords the title &quot;king of Japan&quot; to the Japanese shōgun.

==Envoys to the Qing court==
During Japan&#x27;s self-imposed isolation in the Edo period (1603–1868), Japan&#x27;s vicarious relationships with China evolved through the intermediary of the Kingdom of Ryukyu. Japan&#x27;s view of external relations was ambivalent.

*1853 (&quot;Kaei 6&quot;): Hayashi Akira completed &quot;Tsūkō ichiran&quot;. The work was created under orders from the bakufu to compile and edit documents pertaining to East Asian trade and diplomacy; and, for example, it includes a detailed description of a Ryukyuan tribute embassy to the Qing Chinese court in Beijing.

<text>Biarritz ( , , , ; also spelled ; ) is a city on the Bay of Biscay, on the Atlantic coast in the Pyrénées-Atlantiques department in the French Basque Country in southwestern France. It is located from the border with Spain. It is a luxurious seaside tourist destination known for the Hôtel du Palais (originally built for the Empress Eugénie ), its seafront casinos, and its surfing culture.

==Geography==
Biarritz is located in the Pyrénées-Atlantiques department in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region. It is part of the arrondissement of Bayonne, adjacent to Bayonne and Anglet and from the border with Spain. The city is also in the traditional province of Labourd in the French Basque Country.

===Climate===

Biarritz has a temperate oceanic climate, Cfb in the Köppen climate classification. It is one of the wettest cities in Metropolitan France.

==Etymology==
In Basque, its name is Biarritz or Miarritze. Its current Gascon name is Biàrrits. The name for an inhabitant of the city is Biarrot in French and Biarriztar or Miarriztar in Basque. The suffix &quot;-itz&quot;, as in Isturitz, is a Basque locative.

Biarritz appears as &quot;Bearids&quot; and &quot;Bearriz&quot; in 1150, &quot;Beiarridz&quot; in 1165, &quot;Bearriz&quot; and &quot;Beariz&quot; in 1170, &quot;Bearidz&quot; (1186), &quot;Bearriz&quot; and &quot;Beariz&quot; (12th century), &quot;lo port de Beiarriz&quot; and &quot;Bearridz&quot; in 1261 (cartulaire de Bayonne). Other forms include &quot;Beiarid&quot; (1199), &quot;Bearritz&quot; (1249), &quot;Beiarriz&quot; and &quot;Beiarrids&quot; (1261), &quot;Bearridz&quot; (1281), &quot;Bearrits&quot; (1338), (rôles gascons), &quot;Bearritz&quot; (1498, chapitre de Bayonne), &quot;Sanctus Martinus de Biarriz&quot; (1689, collations du diocèse de Bayonne, &quot;Mearritcen&quot; (1712), &quot;Biarrits&quot; (1863, Dictionnaire topographique Béarn-Pays basque), as well as &quot;Biarritze&quot; and &quot;Miarritze&quot;.

==History==
=== Prehistory ===
Analysis of stones from the Middle Paleolithic shows that the Biarritz area was inhabited at that time.

=== Middle Ages ===
The oldest mention of the city appears in a cartulary, &quot;Bayonne&#x27;s Golden book&quot;, from 1186, where it is named Bearids; some years later the name used was Beiarrids. The first urban development was to the south, at the top, and at the interior. Today this is near the location of the église Saint-Martin, the oldest church in Biarritz. 

In 1152, Eleanor of Aquitaine married Henry II of England, who became suzerain of the Duchy of Aquitaine. Prince Edward, the oldest son of Henry III of England, was invested with the duchy and betrothed to Eleanor of Castile, who brought him rights over Gascony.
Two population centers are attested in the Middle Ages. On the one hand, the église Saint-Martin was active in the neighborhoods in the territory&#x27;s interior, which were: 

On the other hand, the château of Belay (first mentioned in 1342), also called château de Ferragus, protected the coast and the current Port-Vieux (old port), while religious life and community assemblies took place at Notre-Dame-de-Pitié (a chapel mentioned in 1498), dominating the Port-des-Pêcheurs, or fishing port.

A document dated May 26, 1342, attested to this fishing activity, authorising les Biarrots to &quot;(…) remit to Bayonne all the fresh fish that we and succeeding inhabitants of Biarritz can fish from the salt sea&quot;.

Construction of the château de Ferragus was initiated by the English, on the foundations of a Roman work, at the summit of the promontory overlooking the sea, named Atalaye, used as a whale-observation post. This château had a double crenulated wall two meters thick, a drawbridge and four towers. Mentions of this château occur as late as 1603, in the letters patent of Henry IV. One tower remained as of 1739 when a daymark was established there, called &quot;de la Haille&quot;, then &quot;de la Humade&quot;. The tower disappeared in 1856.

=== Whaling ===
Most of the documents, records and official agreements gathered in the archives from Biarritz mention whaling. This was the principal local industry. Consequently, the town&#x27;s coat of arms features the image of a whale below a rowing boat manned by five sailors wearing berets, one of whom is preparing to throw a harpoon. It bears the inscription: &quot;Aura, sidus, mare, adjuvant me&quot; (The air, the stars and the seas are helping me).

Biarritz has long made its living from the sea. After the 7th century, Biarritz had many confrontations with Bayonne, with the Kingdom of England – Lapurdi was under English control – and with the Bishop of Bayonne. Almost all of the disputes were about whale hunting. In 1284, the town&#x27;s right to hunt whales was reinstated by the authorities of Lapurdi and the Duchy of Aquitaine. 

During the Middle Ages and early modern period, a watchtower looked down over the sea at Biarritz, from &quot;La Humade&quot;, waiting for the sight of a whale. Whenever those keeping watch saw a whale, they would burn wet straw to create a large amount of smoke and thus communicate the news to their fellow countrymen. Eventually, however, the tower disappeared.

In the 16th century, as a consequence of hunting in the area, or for other reasons, the whales migrated elsewhere. Whale hunters from Lapurdi, therefore, crossed the Atlantic Ocean in pursuit of them and spent over a century in the Labrador Peninsula and on Newfoundland. Later, instead of hunting whales, they started to fish for cod in Newfoundland. A century later, due to the ban on fishing off the coasts of North America and the steely competence of English and Dutch fishermen, the number of fishing boats from Biarritz diminished, and nowadays the Biarritz fishing industry in these areas has come to an end.

The first lighthouse in the village was built in 1650.

=== 18th century ===

Biarritz was an independent municipality until 1784 with a clergyman and four aldermen, and the city was governed by twelve deputies. Deputies were democratically chosen: there were four districts (Portua, Bustingorri, Hurlaga and Alto), and three deputies had to be chosen from each of them. However, deputies were chosen by the abbot and aldermen. Since there was no Town Hall, they gathered in a ward near the church. As there was not enough space for all in attendance, they held their meetings in the cemetery. Biarritz had around 1,700 citizens at this time.

In the 18th century, doctors claimed that the ocean at Biarritz had therapeutic properties, inspiring patients to make pilgrimages to the beach for alleged cures for their ailments. The city began to transition into a world-famous spa town in the mid-1700s.

=== 19th century ===

From 1784 onwards, after the French Revolution, bathing in the sea was no longer reserved for the mentally ill; sea-baths became fashionable. In 1808, Napoleon himself broke with prejudices and bathed in the Basque Country&#x27;s coastal waters. In 1840, the Municipality of Biarritz started an initiative to attract tourists to the seaside.

Victor Hugo, who visited in 1843, wrote glowingly of Biarritz in his book &quot;Alpes et Pyrénées&quot;:

For good or for ill, Hugo&#x27;s prophecy was fulfilled. Biarritz planted poplars, tamarinds, hydrangeas, roses and pittosporums on the slopes and the hills, set railings on the dunes, covered moats with elegant stairs and polluted with land speculation and hunger for money.

Tourists have long been drawn to Biarritz&#x27;s coast, from the beach at the limit of Bidarte (Plage des Basques), to the cape of Saint Martin. There a tall white lighthouse can be found, constructed in 1834 to replace the one Louis XIV had ordered built. Various hotels appeared, as did a municipal casino, the Belleuve club, the casino, the thalassotherapy house, and wonderful luxury houses. Luxurious branches of shops from London and Paris were also set up, and 36 small newspapers were published. 
Biarritz gained renown in 1854 when Empress Eugenie (the wife of Napoleon III) built a palace on the beach (now the &quot;Hôtel du Palais&quot;). European royalty, including British monarchs Queen Victoria and King Edward VII (who caused a minor scandal when he called H. H. Asquith to kiss hands at Biarritz in 1908 rather than return to London for the ceremony), and the Spanish king Alfonso XIII, were frequent visitors.

Biarritz&#x27;s casino (opened 10 August 1901) and beaches make the town a notable tourist centre for Europeans and East Coast North Americans. 

Opened in June 1893, Biarritz&#x27;s salt baths were designed and built by the architect Lagarde. Sourced from the gatzagas of Beskoitz and passing through a pipe, water ten times saltier than the sea was used. The baths were closed in 1953 and demolished in 1968.

The presence of the French Republic&#x27;s authorities and the launch of the Paris–Hendaye train led Biarritz to become one of the most outstanding tourist areas in Europe. The queen of the beaches became the beach of the kings and queens: Oscar II of Sweden, Leopold of Belgium, empress of Russia Maria Feodorovna, mother of Nicholas II of Russia, Empress Elisabeth of Austria, Natalie of Serbia and her son Alexander I of Serbia, George V from Britain, Edward VII and Britain&#x27;s Queen Victoria, Alfonso XIII of Spain, as well aristocrats, rich people and actors from Europe and South America. In the summer, people of high status gathered in Biarritz. The population thereby increased considerably, from 5,000 to 18,000. At the end of the 19th century, 50,000 vacationers were gathering in Biarritz.

=== &quot;Belle Époque&quot; ===
During the Belle Époque of European peace and prosperity, in 1894, a department store called &quot;Biarritz Bonheur was&quot; created. It was enlarged twice (in 1911 and 1926). It became the temple of luxury and fashion. By the start of the 20th century, most of its workers spoke English.

=== After World War II ===

At the end of World War II in Europe, the U.S. Army&#x27;s Information and Educational Branch was ordered to establish an overseas university campus for demobilized American servicemen and women in the French resort town of Biarritz. Under General Samuel L. McCroskey, the hotels and casinos of Biarritz were converted into quarters, labs, and class spaces for U.S. service personnel. The University opened on 10 August 1945 and about 10,000 students attended an eight-week term. This campus was set up to provide a transition between army life and subsequent attendance at a university in the US, so students attended for just one term. After three successful terms, the G.I. University closed in March 1946 (see G. I. American Universities).

=== The arrival of surfing in Europe ===

In 1957, American film director Peter Viertel was in Biarritz with his British wife, actress Deborah Kerr, working on the film &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;. One of his Californian friends came for a visit and his use of a surfboard off Biarritz is recognized as the first time surfing was practised in Europe. Biarritz eventually became one of the most popular European spots for surfers from around the world, developing a nightlife and surfing-based culture.

==Culture==

===Languages===
As in the cases of Anglet and Bayonne, also located in the approximate cultural border between Gascony and the Basque Country, it is uncertain if the historic language of Biarritz was Basque or Gascon.

According to the book &quot;Atlas Linguistique de Gascogne&quot;, Biarritz is considered a Gascon town. However, in 1863, Louis Lucien Bonaparte located the northern frontier of Basque in Biarritz, and in some neighborhoods it was without any doubt the most used language. However, over the course of the 20th century, French became the main language. Beginning in the 1990s, the municipal government of Biarritz has promoted Basque language and culture. At the same time, Gascon has been promoted by various private institutions, for instance the Gascon cultural association, Ací Gasconha. [19]

==Sport==
Surfing in Biarritz is of a world-class standard and first appeared in 1957. The town has a strong surfing culture, and is known worldwide for its surfing scene and the competitions it hosts yearly, including the Quiksilver/Roxy Jam tournament. In July 2011, Biarritz also hosted the Roxy Pro event, a tournament in the ASP Women&#x27;s World Tour.

The town is home to a prominent rugby union club, Biarritz Olympique, who have won five French championships and two European Cups.

Basque pelota is a very popular sport in the Basque country. Several local and international competitions take place in Biarritz.

The golf course near the lighthouse (Le Phare) was established in 1888 by British residents. In addition, the town has a large circular golf range area on the border with Illbaritz.

<doc id="227269" wikidata="Q1809028" url="?curid=227269" title="Bailment">
<text>Bailment is a legal relationship in common law, where the owner of personal property (&quot;chattel&quot;) transfers physical possession of that property to another, who holds the property for a certain purpose, but retains ownership. The owner who surrenders custody of a property is called the &quot;bailor&quot; and the individual who accepts the property is called a &quot;bailee&quot;. The bailee is the person who possesses the personal property in trust for the owner for a set time and for a precise reason and who delivers the property back to the owner when they have accomplished the purpose that was initially intended.

==General==
Bailment is distinguished from a contract of sale or a gift of property, as it only involves the transfer of possession and not its ownership. To create a bailment, the bailee must both intend to possess, and actually physically possess, the bailable chattel for example a car mechanic business when a car has been dropped off for repair. Although a bailment relationship is ordinarily created by contract, there are circumstances where lawful possession by the bailee creates a bailment relationship without an ordinary contract, such as an involuntary bailment. A bailment relationship between the bailor and bailee is generally less formal than a fiduciary relationship.

In addition, unlike a lease or rental, where ownership remains with the lessor but the lessee is allowed to use the property, the bailee is generally not entitled to the use of the property while it is in his possession. However, a lease of personal property is the same as a bailment for hire, where the bailee gains the right to use the property. 

A common example of bailment is leaving one&#x27;s car with a valet. Leaving a car in an unattended parking garage, however, is typically a lease or license of a parking space rather than a bailment, as the garage does not take possession of (i.e. exercise dominion or control over) the car. However, bailments arise in many other situations, including terminated leases of property, warehousing (including store-it-yourself), or in carriage of goods.

=== Governing law ===
In the United States, bailments are frequently governed by statute. For example, the UCC regulates personal property leases. State bailment for hire statutes may also regulate the rights and duties of parties in the bailment relationship. The Malay States&#x27; ordinance of 1950 on contracts stated that:

Bailment is a typical common law concept, although similar concepts exist in civil law.

==Purposes==
There are three types of bailments, based on the purpose of the relationship:

#for the benefit of the bailor and bailee
#for the sole benefit of the bailor; and
#for the sole benefit of the bailee.

A bailment for the mutual benefit of the parties is created when there is an exchange of performances between the parties (e.g. a bailment for the repair of an item when the owner is paying to have the repair accomplished).

A bailor receives the sole benefit from a bailment when a bailee acts gratuitously (e.g. the owner leaves the precious item such as a car or a piece of jewelry in the safekeeping of a trusted friend while the owner is traveling abroad without any agreement to compensate the friend).

A bailment is created for the sole benefit of the bailee when a bailor acts gratuitously (e.g., the loan of a book to a patron, the bailee, from a library, the bailor).

==Damages==
Plaintiffs will be able to sue for damages based on the duty of care. Often this will be normal tort damages. Plaintiff may elect also to sue for conversion, either in the replevin or trover, although these are generally considered older, common law damages.

==Terms==
Bailment can arise in a number of situations and is often described by the type of relationship that gave rise to the bailment. Two common distinctions are:

* For consideration versus gratuitous. If a person agrees to accept a fee or other good consideration for holding possession of goods, they are generally, although not always, held to a higher standard of care than a person who is doing so without being paid (or receives no benefit). Consider a paid coat-check counter versus a free coat hook by the front door and the respective obligations of the bailee. Some establishments even post signs to the effect that &quot;no bailment&quot; is created by leaving your personal possessions in their care, but local laws may prevent unfair enforcement of such terms (especially attended car parks).
* Fixed-term versus indefinite-term. A bailor who leaves property for a fixed term may be deemed to have abandoned the property if it is not removed at the end of the term, or it may convert to an involuntary bailment for a reasonable time (e.g., abandoned property in a bank safe, eventually escheats to the state, and the treasurer may hold it for some period, awaiting the owner). However, if there is no clear term of bailment agreed upon, the goods cannot be considered abandoned unless the bailee is given notice that the bailor wishes to give up possession of the goods. Frequently, in the case of storage of goods, the bailee also acquires a contractual or statutory right to dispose of the goods to satisfy overdue rent.

<doc id="227273" wikidata="Q1068962" url="?curid=227273" title="Sonic Heroes">
<text>is a 2003 platform game developed by Sonic Team USA and published by Sega as part of the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; series. The player races a team of series characters through levels to amass rings, defeat robots, and collect the seven Chaos Emeralds needed to defeat Doctor Eggman. Within each level, the player switches between the team&#x27;s three characters, who each have unique abilities, to overcome obstacles. &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot; downplays the action-adventure and exploration-based gameplay of its predecessors &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; (1998) and &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot; (2001) in favor of returning to the linear style of Sega Genesis-era &quot;Sonic&quot; games.

&quot;Heroes&quot; was the first multi-platform &quot;Sonic&quot; game, produced for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, and Windows. Sonic Team USA&#x27;s Yuji Naka and Takashi Iizuka led the game&#x27;s 20-month development. The team wanted &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot; to appeal beyond &quot;Sonic&quot; series fans and so designed a game that did not depend on the continuation of its predecessors. The team revived elements not seen since the Genesis &quot;Sonic&quot; games, such as special stages and the Chaotix characters.

Sega released &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot; in Japan in December 2003 and worldwide in early 2004. It was a commercial success, with 3.41 million copies sold by 2007, but received mixed reviews. Critics praised the focus on fast gameplay and similarities to the series&#x27; original 2D entries, a choice that some considered an improvement from the &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; games. Reviewers also highlighted its graphic design and detailed environments and textures. However, they felt it did not address the problems of previous &quot;Sonic&quot; games, such as the camera and voice acting.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Sonic Heroes&quot; is a 3D platformer. While the preceding &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; games for the Dreamcast featured elements of action-adventure and exploration, &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot; focuses on linear platforming and action, similar to the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; games for the Sega Genesis. The story is also simpler than those of the &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; games. In it, series antagonist Doctor Eggman threatens to use a weapon to destroy the world and sends out legions of robots. Four groups of three characters from the franchise&#x27;s history separately team up to put a stop to Eggman&#x27;s plans. The player navigates using one of the teams, who serve as the player characters. The teams include Team Sonic, which consists of series regulars Sonic the Hedgehog, Miles &quot;Tails&quot; Prower, and Knuckles the Echidna; Team Dark, which includes Shadow the Hedgehog and Rouge the Bat from &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot;, and new character E-123 Omega (considered a spiritual successor to E-102 Gamma from &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;); Team Rose, which has Amy Rose, Cream the Rabbit from &quot;Sonic Advance 2&quot;, and Big the Cat from &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;; and Team Chaotix, consisting of Espio the Chameleon, Charmy Bee, and Vector the Crocodile from &quot;Knuckles&#x27; Chaotix&quot;. Each team has its own campaign, called a story. Each also represents a different difficulty. Amy&#x27;s team, for example, is designed for beginners, while Shadow&#x27;s is aimed at more experienced players.

The game begins with a tutorial followed by fourteen normal levels and seven boss fights. Gameplay is generally similar in each story: the player must race through levels to advance the story and collect rings for protection and lives. Level themes vary from beaches to casinos. When the player reaches the end of a level, they are graded based on their performance; an &quot;A&quot; rank is highest, while an &quot;E&quot; is lowest. Enemy robots are scattered around levels and must be defeated by jumping on them or other means of attack. The level designs differ slightly between each story. Espio, Charmy, and Vector&#x27;s levels are distinguished from the other teams&#x27; because they are mission-based, requiring players to fulfill a specific objective, like collecting items, to clear a level.

Teams contain three character types: Speed (such as Sonic), Flight (such as Tails), and Power (such as Knuckles), which the player toggles between. Speed characters can perform attacks that allow them to lock onto enemies and objects, dash across lines of rings, and can form whirlwinds to climb up poles. Flight characters can temporarily fly and attack airborne enemies, while Power characters can break through objects and glide on gusts of air. By acquiring certain items or enemies, characters can level up, becoming more efficient when fighting enemies, though these level up items are lost if the player loses a life.

By collecting keys hidden within levels and reaching the end of a level without getting hit, players can enter special stages. In special stages, players dash across a tube, collecting spheres containing boost power while avoiding obstacles. There are two types of special stages: Bonus Challenge and Emerald Challenge. Bonus Challenges are optional and award the player with extra lives. Emerald Challenges task the player with catching a Chaos Emerald before it disappears. 

If players collect all seven Emeralds and clear each story, an additional Last Story is unlocked. The Last Story reveals the plot was orchestrated by Metal Sonic, Eggman&#x27;s top enforcer and a robotic copy of Sonic, in an effort to destroy his namesake. Outside the main game, players can unlock promotional trailers to view and music to listen to. The game also features a split screen multiplayer mode, in which two players can race or battle. Challenges in the multiplayer mode include kart racing and collecting as many rings as possible.

==Plot==
Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles receive a letter from Doctor Eggman, telling them that in three days, he will launch his Egg Fleet in an attempt to take over the world, challenging them to stop him. Rouge infiltrates one of Eggman&#x27;s bases, where she is surprised to discover Shadow, last seen falling from the Space Colony ARK, asleep in a pod. When she awakens him and one of Eggman&#x27;s robots, E-123 Omega, from their stasis, the three reluctantly agree to work together, with Omega wanting revenge for being locked up and Shadow, who has amnesia, wanting answers regarding who he is. Amy helps Big and Cream track down Big&#x27;s pet, Froggy, and Cheese&#x27;s brother, Chocola Chao, who were both reportedly kidnapped by Sonic. The Chaotix Detective Agency (Vector, Espio and Charmy) receive a job offer from a mysterious client, where they execute a series of tasks to prove themselves.

The four teams chase down Eggman through various zones, crossing paths with each other at several points, until they all end up on the Egg Fleet. There, Rouge discovers an armada of Shadow Androids, wondering if their Shadow is just one of them too. The Chaotix end up rescuing their mystery client, revealed to be Eggman. He explains that he was locked up and betrayed by Metal Sonic, now going by &quot;Neo Metal Sonic&quot;, who had adopted the guise of Eggman and taken control of the Egg Fleet to prove himself superior to Sonic. Using the data he collected from observing all the teams in action and the power of Chaos copied from Froggy and Chocola, he transforms into his ultimate state, the &quot;Metal Overlord&quot;. Using the power of the Chaos Emeralds all the teams had collected, they work together to take down Metal, with Sonic turning Super (accompanied by Tails and Knuckles) to defeat him. After Metal Sonic is defeated and reverts to his original form, Sonic and everyone go their separate ways, while the Chaotix chase after Eggman, demanding payment from him.

==Development==

&quot;Sonic Heroes&quot; was developed by the 19-member Sonic Team USA in San Francisco to commemorate the &quot;Sonic&quot; series&#x27; 12th anniversary. Development was led by producer Yuji Naka and director/lead designer Takashi Iizuka,&lt;ref name=&quot;w/thecreators&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and lasted 20 months. The majority of the development team had worked on previous &quot;Sonic&quot; games. Iizuka did not want to make a sequel to &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot; (2001), as he worried it would only appeal to &quot;Sonic&quot; fans. Interested in returning to gameplay similar to the Genesis games, Sonic Team decided to design &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot; so casual players not familiar with &quot;Sonic&quot; could adapt. Iizuka said the development period of &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot; was the most stressful of his career because of deadlines and Sega management. A fellow designer became ill, so he worked relentlessly, lost , and suffered from insomnia.

&quot;Sonic Heroes&quot; was the first multi-platform &quot;Sonic&quot; game: it was developed for the GameCube, PlayStation 2 (PS2), and Xbox. Unlike the &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; games, made using proprietary software, Sonic Team partnered with Criterion Software to use the RenderWare game engine so the game could be programmed and ported with ease to each platform. Though Sonic Team was able to transfer some textures and models from the &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; games into &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot;, most of their work started from scratch. Sonic Team found challenges in working with the Xbox and PS2, platforms with which they had little experience. The content in all versions is the same, but the PS2 version runs at 30 frames per second (FPS) in contrast to the other versions running at 60 FPS. Sega&#x27;s Noah Musler explained that running the PS2 version at 60 FPS would have caused performance problems. Iizuka also noted the system is less powerful than the GameCube and Xbox. Iizuka and Naka decided against including console-exclusive content so players could have the same experience regardless of console.

Sonic Team was interested in making &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot;″s narrative feature characters teaming up to overcome evil, rather than &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;″s approach of individual character stories. This led to the conception of the &quot;team action&quot; concept. Iizuka stated Sonic Team had a considerable amount of freedom in designing the game due to its new scope. The Chao-raising system—a staple of the &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; games—was removed because Sonic Team feared it would disrupt the pace. To improve replay value, the grading system was made more difficult. The special stages from the 2D games were revived to &quot;refresh players&#x27; minds&quot; and change the pace. Player reactions to previous games influenced the design; for example, the team did not include modes like Big&#x27;s fishing from &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; and Tails&#x27; shooting from &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot; after both were criticized.

The Chaotix, who had appeared in the 1995 spinoff game &quot;Knuckles&#x27; Chaotix&quot;, were revived for &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot; because Sonic Team thought they were unique and had never used them. Iizuka said he did not consider the Chaotix in &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot; the same team from &quot;Knuckles&#x27; Chaotix&quot;, claiming to have created new characters using the same designs from 1995. The game marks the debut of E-123 Omega in the &quot;Sonic&quot; series. Sonic Team wanted to include as many teams as possible, but time constraints and a desire to keep the gameplay balanced prevented this. The game features several animated cutscenes produced by Vision Scape Interactive. Jun Senoue composed the majority of the soundtrack. His band Crush 40 performed the main theme, &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot;, and the final boss theme, &quot;What I&#x27;m Made Of&quot;. The theme songs for each team were performed by Ted Poley, Tony Harnell, Kay Hanley, Julien-K, and Gunnar Nelson. Iizuka said that the intention was for the music &quot;to return to the roots of the &quot;Sonic&quot; experience&quot; and be exciting and fast-paced.

Naka believed that &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot;, a &quot;Sonic&quot;-themed McDonald&#x27;s Happy Meal toy line, and the anime series &quot;Sonic X&quot; would expose the franchise to a new generation. Sega released &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot; in Japan on December 30, 2003, two weeks later than intended, to ensure there were &quot;no compromises&quot; in the final product. The GameCube version was released in North America on January 6, 2004, followed by the Xbox and PS2 versions on January 27. The European version was released on February 2, 2004. A Windows version was released in North America on November 16, 2004, followed by Europe on November 26 and Japan on December 9. The game was rereleased through the &quot;Sonic PC Collection&quot; for Windows on October 2, 2009, and the PS2 Classics line for the PlayStation 3 (PS3) on February 22, 2012.

==Reception==
&quot;Sonic Heroes&quot; received generally &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews, according to the review aggregator Metacritic. Some reviewers felt the game was better than the previous 3D &quot;Sonic&quot; games but still below the quality of the 2D games. The PS2 and PC&#x27;s version&#x27;s reviews were considerably worse than others; reviewers noted clipping, graphic faults, and its lower frame rate.

The aesthetics and sound were generally well received. &quot;IGN&quot; lauded detailed, varied, and realistic character models, and wrote that the textures were detailed and crisp. They also praised the realistic shading and lighting effects. Although &quot;GameSpot&quot; thought the graphics were not much of an improvement from previous games—comparing them to &quot;a glorified Dreamcast game&quot;—they still praised its steady frame rate, art design, and vibrant colors. &quot;Eurogamer&quot; disliked the shiny models, but was still pleased by the imaginative aesthetics. In regards to the soundtrack, &quot;Game Revolution&quot; found it upbeat and catchy, offering particular praise for the music of Bingo Highway. Although they called the music laughable and not an improvement from previous games, &quot;IGN&quot; thought the rest of the sound was high quality, and praised its &quot;perfectly implemented&quot; sound effects running in Dolby Pro Logic II.

Multiple reviewers found the gameplay similar to that of the Genesis &quot;Sonic&quot; games. &quot;GameSpot&quot; found &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot; the closest Sonic Team ever got to recreating the classic 2D &quot;Sonic&quot; gameplay in 3D. They praised the game for stripping away the shooting and hunting elements from the &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; games, and called it &quot;a purer, more action-packed Sonic experience&quot; than previous games. &quot;IGN&quot; considered &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot; a major improvement from &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;, writing &quot;&quot;Sonic Heroes&quot; does an absolutely sensational job of re-creating the intensely fast and unpredictable looping, corkscrewing stages from the classic games in 3D&quot;. &quot;1UP.com&quot; and &quot;GameSpy&quot; agreed that the game was a step in the right direction for the series. Levi Buchanan of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote that &quot;when Sonic is in charge, &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot; is a pure action game. It&#x27;s an enjoyable throwback to the Genesis era, when Sonic was all about speed, running circles around Mario, collecting rings while Nintendo&#x27;s plumber searched high and low for his shape-altering mushrooms. And for gamers who have been numb in the thumb long enough to remember those heady days, the return to form is most welcome. (Especially after those underwhelming Dreamcast &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; games that Sega ported to the GameCube.)&quot; Reviewers called the casino level, Bingo Highway, a highlight. 

Reviewers were generally divided over the team-based gameplay. &quot;GameSpy&quot; argued it was well-balanced and thought it greatly increased the replay value. &quot;IGN&quot; offered similar praise, praising its easy-to-learn, strategic controls. &quot;Game Revolution&quot; wrote the system added diversity. However, &quot;IGN&quot; also thought it was not as ambitious as expected and did not change the overall experience. &quot;GameSpot&quot; agreed the controls were easy, but considered the large number of teams unnecessary: &quot;no one cares about these peripheral characters... People play &quot;Sonic&quot; games to play as Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;. &quot;1UP&quot; found the concept was more repetitive than innovative. &quot;Eurogamer&quot; considered the gameplay original but &quot;boring and obvious&quot; and thought that the controls were clunky and unorthodox. While &quot;Eurogamer&quot; argued &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot; was not difficult, &quot;Game Revolution&quot; described it as hard to a fault, exclaiming they &quot;[died] all the time.&quot; Buchanan wrote that &quot;when you switch away from Sonic and Tails, the game itself kind of stops cold. Especially when you play as one of the other three teams that feature ancillary characters from Sonic’s stable as they play through similar levels with slightly different goals.&quot; Charles Herold of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;getting stuck on the fourth level exposed one of the game&#x27;s major flaws: the levels are fairly static. The old 2-D Sonic games always seemed to have several different routes through different landscapes. Jump across a chasm, and you could take a mountainside path; miss the jump, and you would run through the valley below. You could play these levels repeatedly and rarely take the exact same route. But while in &quot;Heroes&quot; you occasionally come to a fork in the road, you are likely to find yourself running basically the same trail every time you go through a level. This is disappointing, and especially surprising considering the team play element. With three characters whose different abilities let them overcome different challenges, it would make sense to have dozens of areas per level where the various characters can lead you to different paths. But the game too rarely capitalizes on this potential.&quot; 

The game was criticized for not addressing the problems of prior &quot;Sonic&quot; games. &quot;1UP&quot; wrote the problems with the camera and &quot;hit-or-miss lock-on attacks that leave you plunging to your doom&quot; that plagued the &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; games were still present in &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot; and hurt the experience greatly. &quot;GameSpot&quot; said although the camera worked well most of the time, coordination between camera position and character movement caused problems, such that pushing forward may not move the character in the same direction the camera is facing. They also wrote that the game suffered from problems with the collision detection and noted all the shortcomings were present in the &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; games. &quot;IGN&quot; agreed the camera had not been improved. The voice acting was especially derided; &quot;IGN&quot; joked players should &quot;turn down the volume during cut-scenes&quot;, and &quot;GameSpy&quot; compared the voice work to the likes of Playskool.

The editors of &quot;GameSpot&quot; ultimately named &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot; the best GameCube game of January 2004, and called it &quot;the fastest and most authentic 3D &quot;Sonic&quot; experience we&#x27;ve seen yet.&quot;

===Sales===
&quot;Sonic Heroes&quot; was a major commercial success. By October 2004, the game had sold over one million copies in Europe. The PlayStation 2 version received a &quot;Double Platinum&quot; sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association, indicating sales of at least 600,000 copies in the United Kingdom. According to Sega&#x27;s financial reports, &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot; sold 1.42 million units from its release to March 2004 (850,000 in the U.S., 420,000 in Europe, and 150,000 in Japan), 1.57 million units from March 2004 to March 2005, and 420,000 units in the U.S. from March 2006 to March 2007, for total sales of at least 3.41 million. By the end of 2004, it had been branded as part of the Player&#x27;s Choice line on the GameCube, the Greatest Hits line on the PS2, and the Platinum Hits line on the Xbox.

==Legacy==
After &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot;, Sonic Team USA was renamed Sega Studios USA. Their next project was &quot;Shadow the Hedgehog&quot; (2005), a spinoff starring Shadow set shortly after the events of &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot;. In 2008, after working on a few more games, the division was merged with Sonic Team in Japan. In 2017 series retrospective, &quot;USgamer&quot; ranked &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot; among the franchise&#x27;s bottom half of games. They wrote that the system of switching between characters was unwieldy and annoying, but still interesting because it made the game feel like a puzzle video game. They also praised the design of E-123 Omega.

&quot;Sonic Heroes&quot; marked the debut of recurring &quot;Sonic&quot; character E-123 Omega, and reintroduced the obscure Chaotix. Its concept of switching between characters as necessary was reused in Sonic Team&#x27;s &quot;Sonic Forces&quot; (2017) and Sumo Digital&#x27;s &quot;Team Sonic Racing&quot; (2019); Sumo Digital cited it as inspiration for their game. The Seaside Hill level reappears in the 20th anniversary game &quot;Sonic Generations&quot; for PS3, Xbox 360, and Windows, while the Nintendo 3DS version includes the special stages and the Egg Emperor boss fight. In the game&#x27;s remaster, &quot;Sonic X Shadow Generations&quot;, the Rail Canyon level and Metal Overlord boss fight return. Seaside Hill has also appeared in &quot;Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games&quot; (2009), &quot;Sonic &amp; Sega All-Stars Racing&quot; (2010), and its 2012 sequel.

<text>Georges Lacombe (18 June 1868 – 29 June 1916) was a French sculptor and painter.

==Early life==
Born to a distinguished family of Versailles, he received his artistic training at the Académie Julian from the impressionists Alfred Philippe Roll and Henri Gervex.

==The Nabis==
At the Académie Julian he met Émile Bernard and Paul Sérusier in 1892, shortly afterwards becoming a member of their artist group, Les Nabis.

Like many other Nabi he spent the summers from 1888 to 1897 in Brittany, some sources record that he met Bernard and Sérusier there. He became &quot;Le Nabi sculpteur&quot;: the sculptor of the group. In fact many sources refer to him solely as sculptor.

==Death==
Georges Lacombe died of tuberculosis in Alençon, Orne on 29 June 1916, eleven days after his 48th birthday.

<text>A projected coordinate systemalso called a projected coordinate reference system, planar coordinate system, or grid reference systemis a type of spatial reference system that represents locations on Earth using Cartesian coordinates (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) on a planar surface created by a particular map projection. Each projected coordinate system, such as &quot;Universal Transverse Mercator WGS 84 Zone 26N,&quot; is defined by a choice of map projection (with specific parameters), a choice of geodetic datum to bind the coordinate system to real locations on the earth, an origin point, and a choice of unit of measure. Hundreds of projected coordinate systems have been specified for various purposes in various regions.

When the first standardized coordinate systems were created during the 20th century, such as the Universal Transverse Mercator, State Plane Coordinate System, and British National Grid, they were commonly called &quot;grid systems&quot;; the term is still common in some domains such as the military that encode coordinates as alphanumeric &quot;grid references&quot;. However, the term &quot;projected coordinate system&quot; has recently become predominant to clearly differentiate it from other types of spatial reference system. The term is used in international standards such as the EPSG and ISO 19111 (also published by the Open Geospatial Consortium as Abstract Specification 2), and in most geographic information system software.

==History==

The map projection and the geographic coordinate system (GCS, latitude and longitude) date to the Hellenistic period, proliferating during the Enlightenment Era of the 18th century. However, their use as the basis for specifying precise locations, rather than latitude and longitude, is a 20th century innovation.

Among the earliest was the State Plane Coordinate System (SPCS), which was developed in the United States during the 1930s for surveying and engineering, because calculations such as distance are much simpler in a Cartesian coordinate system than the three-dimensional trigonometry of GCS. In the United Kingdom, the first version of the British National Grid was released in 1938, based on earlier experiments during World War I by the Army and the Ordnance Survey.

During World War II, modern warfare practices required soldiers to quickly and accurately measure and report their location, leading to the printing of grids on maps by the U.S. Army Map Service (AMS) and other combatants. Initially, each theater of war was mapped in a custom projection with its own grid and coding system, but this resulted in confusion. This led to the development of the Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system, possibly adopted from a system originally developed by the German Wehrmacht. To facilitate unambiguous reporting, the alphanumeric Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) was then created as an encoding scheme for UTM coordinates to make them easier to communicate.

After the War, UTM gradually gained users, especially in the scientific community. Because UTM zones do not align with political boundaries, several countries followed the United Kingdom in creating their own national or regional grid systems based on custom projections. The use and invention of such systems especially proliferated during the 1980s with the emergence of geographic information systems. GIS requires locations to be specified as precise coordinates and performs numerous calculations on them, making Cartesian geometry preferable to spherical trigonometry when computing power was at a premium. In recent years, the rise of global GIS datasets and satellite navigation, along with an abundance of processing speed in personal computers, have led to a resurgence in the use of GCS. That said, projected coordinate systems are still very common in the GIS data stored in the spatial data infrastructures (SDI) of local areas, such as cities, counties, states and provinces, and small countries.

==System specification==
Because the purpose of any coordinate system is to accurately and unambiguously measure, communicate, and perform calculations on locations, it must be defined precisely. The EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset is the most common mechanism for publishing such definitions in a machine-readable form, and forms the basis for many GIS and other location-aware software programs. A projected SRS specification consists of three parts:
* An abstract two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system that allows for the measurement of each location as a tuple (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;), which are also called the &quot;easting&quot; and &quot;northing&quot; in many systems such as UTM. Any coordinate system definition must include a planar surface, an origin point, a set of orthogonal axes to define the direction of each measurement, and a unit of measure (usually the meter or US foot).
* A choice of map projection that creates a planar surface for the coordinate system that is connected to locations on the Earth. In addition to the general type of projection (e.g., Lambert conformal conic, transverse Mercator), a coordinate system definition will specify the parameters to be used, such as a center point, standard parallels, scale factor, false origin, and such. With these parameters, the underlying formulas of the projection convert latitude and longitude directly into the (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) coordinates of the system.
* A choice of geodetic datum, which includes a choice of earth ellipsoid. This binds the coordinate system to actual locations on the Earth by controlling the measurement framework for latitude and longitude (GCS). Thus, there will be a significant difference between the coordinate of a location in &quot;UTM NAD83 Zone 14N&quot; and for the same location in &quot;UTM NAD27 Zone 14N&quot;, even though the UTM formulas are identical, because the underlying latitude and longitude values are different. In some GIS software, this part of the definition is called the choice of a particular geographic coordinate system.

=== Projections ===
To establish the position of a geographic location on a map, a map projection is used to convert geodetic coordinates to plane coordinates on a map; it projects the datum ellipsoidal coordinates and height onto a flat surface of a map. The datum, along with a map projection applied to a grid of reference locations, establishes a &quot;grid system&quot; for plotting locations. Conformal projections are generally preferred. Common map projections include the transverse Mercator (used in Universal Transverse Mercator, the British National Grid, the State Plane Coordinate System for some states), Lambert conformal conic (some states in the SPCS), and Mercator (Swiss coordinate system).

Map projection formulas depend on the geometry of the projection as well as parameters dependent on the particular location at which the map is projected. The set of parameters can vary based on the type of project and the conventions chosen for the projection. For the transverse Mercator projection used in UTM, the parameters associated are the latitude and longitude of the natural origin, the false northing and false easting, and an overall scale factor. Given the parameters associated with particular location or grin, the projection formulas for the transverse Mercator are a complex mix of algebraic and trigonometric functions.

===Easting and northing===
Every map projection has a &quot;natural origin&quot;, e.g., at which the ellipsoid and flat map surfaces coincide, at which point the projection formulas generate a coordinate of (0,0). To ensure that the northing and easting coordinates on a map are not negative (thus making measurement, communication, and computation easier), map projections may set up a &quot;false origin&quot;, specified in terms of &quot;false northing&quot; and &quot;false easting&quot; values, that offset the true origin. For example, in UTM, the origin of each northern zone is a point on the equator 500 km west of the central meridian of the zone (the edge of the zone itself is just under 400 km to the west). This has the desirable effect of making all coordinates within the zone positive values, being east and north of the origin. Because of this, they are often referred to as the &quot;easting&quot; and &quot;northing&quot;. 

===Grid north===
Grid north (GN) is a navigational term referring to the direction northwards along the grid lines of a map projection. It is contrasted with true north (the direction of the North Pole) and magnetic north (the direction in which a compass needle points). Many topographic maps, including those of the United States Geological Survey and Great Britain&#x27;s Ordnance Survey, indicate the difference between grid north, true north, and magnetic north.

The grid lines on Ordnance Survey maps divide the UK into one-kilometre squares, east of an imaginary zero point in the Atlantic Ocean, west of Cornwall. The grid lines point to a Grid North, varying slightly from True North. This variation is zero on the central meridian (north-south line) of the map, which is at two degrees west of the Prime Meridian, and greatest at the map edges. The difference between grid north and true north is very small and can be ignored for most navigation purposes. The difference exists because the correspondence between a flat map and the round Earth is necessarily imperfect.

At the South Pole, grid north conventionally points northwards along the Prime Meridian. Since the meridians converge at the poles, true east and west directions change rapidly in a condition similar to gimbal lock. Grid north solves this problem.

==Grid reference encodings==
Locations in a projected coordinate system, like any cartesian coordinate system, are measured and reported as easting/northing or (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) pairs. The pair is usually represented conventionally with easting first, northing second. For example, the peak of Mount Assiniboine (at on the British Columbia/Alberta border in Canada) in UTM Zone 11 is at codice_1, meaning that is almost 600km east of the false origin for Zone 11 (95km east of the true central meridian at 117°W) and 5.6 million meters north of the equator. 

While such precise numbers are easy to store and calculate in GIS and other computer databases, they can be difficult for humans to remember and communicate. Thus, since the mid 20th century, there have been alternative encodings that shorten the numbers or convert the numbers into some form of alphanumeric string.

For example, a truncated grid reference may be used where the general location is already known to participants and may be assumed. Because the (leading) most significant digits specify the part of the world and the (trailing) least significant digits provide a precision that is not needed in most circumstances, they may be unnecessary for some uses. This permits users to shorten the example coordinates to codice_2 by concealing , assuming the significant digits (3,4, and 5 in this case) are known to both parties.

Alphanumeric encodings typically use codes to replace the most significant digits by partitioning the world up into large grid squares. For example, in the Military Grid Reference System, the above coordinate is in grid 11U (representing UTM Zone 11 5xxxxxx mN), and grid cell NS within that (representing the second digit 5xxxxxmE x6xxxxxm N), and as many remaining digits as are needed are reported, yielding an MGRS grid reference of 11U NS 949 361 (or 11U NS 9493 3617 or 11U NS 94934 36174). 
The Ordnance Survey National Grid (United Kingdom) and other national grid systems use similar approaches. In Ordnance Survey maps, each Easting and Northing grid line is given a two-digit code, based on the British national grid reference system with an origin point just off the southwest coast of the United Kingdom. The area is divided into 100 km squares, each of which is denoted by a two-letter code. Within each 100 km square, a numerical grid reference is used. Since the Eastings and Northings are one kilometre apart, a combination of a Northing and an Easting will give a four-digit grid reference describing a one-kilometre square on the ground. The convention is the grid reference numbers call out the lower-left corner of the desired square. In the example map above, the town Little Plumpton lies in the square 6901, even though the writing which labels the town is in 6802 and 6902, most of the buildings (the orange boxed symbols) are in square 6901.

===Precision===

The more digits added to a grid reference, the more precise the reference becomes. To locate a specific building in Little Plumpton, a further two digits are added to the four-digit reference to create a six-digit reference. The extra two digits describe a position within the 1-kilometre square. Imagine (or draw or superimpose a Romer) a further 10x10 grid within the current grid square. Any of the 100 squares in the superimposed 10×10 grid can be accurately described using a digit from 0 to 9 (with 0 0 being the bottom left square and 9 9 being the top right square).

For the church in Little Plumpton, this gives the digits 6 and 7 (6 on the left to right axis (Eastings) and 7 on the bottom to top axis (Northings). These are added to the four-figure grid reference after the two digits describing the same coordinate axis, and thus our six-figure grid reference for the church becomes 696017. This reference describes a 100-metre by 100-metre square, and not a single point, but this precision is usually sufficient for navigation purposes. The symbols on the map are not precise in any case, for example the church in the example above would be approximately 100x200 metres if the symbol was to scale, so in fact, the middle of the black square represents the map position of the real church, independently of the actual size of the church.

Grid references comprising larger numbers for greater precision could be determined using large-scale maps and an accurate Romer. This might be used in surveying but is not generally used for land navigating for walkers or cyclists, etc. The growing availability and decreasing cost of handheld GPS receivers enables determination of accurate grid references without needing a map, but it is important to know how many digits the GPS displays to avoid reading off just the first six digits. A GPS unit commonly gives a ten-digit grid reference, based on two groups of five numbers for the Easting and Northing values. Each successive increase in precision (from 6 digit to 8 digit to 10 digit) pinpoints the location more precisely by a factor of 10. Since, in the UK at least, a 6-figure grid reference identifies a square of 100-metre sides, an 8-figure reference would identify a 10-metre square, and a 10-digit reference a 1-metre square. In order to give a standard 6-figure grid reference from a 10-figure GPS readout, the 4th, 5th, 9th and 10th digits must be omitted, so it is important not to read just the first 6 digits.

<doc id="227281" wikidata="Q641010" url="?curid=227281" title="Bledisloe Cup">
<text>The Bledisloe Cup is an annual rugby union competition between the national teams of Australia&#x27;s Wallabies and New Zealand&#x27;s All Blacks that has been contested since the 1930s. The frequency that the competition is held has varied, as has the number of matches played in each tournament, but it currently consists of an annual three-match series, reduced to a two-match series in World Cup years, with two of the matches counting towards The Rugby Championship. New Zealand have had the most success, winning the trophy in 2024 for the 52nd time and 22nd in succession (excluding the disputed inaugural competition in 1931), while Australia have won the trophy 12 times.

==History== 

Semantics plays a role in the issue when was the inaugural Bledisloe Cup match played. The Australian Rugby Union (ARU) contend that the one-off 1931 match played at Eden Park was first. The only record of a match taking place is recorded in the minutes of a New Zealand union management meeting several days later that Lord Bledisloe wished to present a cup for the All Blacks and Wallabies competition. The New Zealand Rugby Union (NZRU) believe that the first match was when New Zealand toured Australia in 1932.

Between 1931 and 1981, the Bledisloe Cup was contested irregularly in the course of rugby tours between the two countries, with New Zealand winning it nineteen times and Australia four times. In 1949, Australia won the competition for the first time on New Zealand soil. The trophy itself was apparently &#x27;lost&#x27; during this period and reportedly rediscovered in a Melbourne store room. It was contested annually from 1982 to 1995, sometimes as a series of three matches (two in 1995) and other times in a single match. During these years, New Zealand won the trophy eleven times and Australia three times.

Since 1996, the cup has been contested as part of the annual Tri Nations tournament. Until 1998, the cup was contested in a three-match series consisting of the two Tri Nations matches between the two sides and a third match. New Zealand won the series in 1996 and 1997, and Australia won it in 1998.

In 1996, and from 1999 through 2005, the third match was not played; during these years, Australia and New Zealand played each other twice as part of the Tri Nations for the cup. If the two teams won one game each, or if both games were drawn, the cup was retained by its current holder. The non-holder needed to win the two games 2–0 or 1–0 (with a draw) to regain the cup. A criticism of this system was that, with the two sides being very well matched in ability level, it was very common for the teams to win one game each and many rugby fans were dissatisfied with one team keeping the cup in the years when the series was tied at 1–1 (1999, 2000, 2002, 2004).

In 2006, the Tri Nations series was extended so that each team played each other three times, meaning a return of the three-game contest for the Bledisloe Cup. However, the cup reverted to the two-game contest in 2007 because the Tri Nations was abbreviated that year to minimise interference with the teams&#x27; preparations for the World Cup.

The three-match format for the Bledisloe Cup continued in 2012, with the first two matches taking place as part of the 2012 Rugby Championship.

==Neutral venues==
===Hong Kong===
In 2008 the Bledisloe Cup was contested over an unprecedented four matches, with three games each played in Australia and New Zealand, followed by a fourth (and potentially deciding) game in Hong Kong, in an effort to promote the game in Asia. This was the first time Australia and New Zealand had played in a third country outside the Rugby World Cup. The Hong Kong match drew a crowd of 39,000 to see the All Blacks defeat the Wallabies 19–14 (despite New Zealand having already won the Bledisloe Cup for 2008), generating a reported £5.5 million and proving to be a financial success for the two unions. A fourth match was again set in Hong Kong in 2010, but failed to attract sufficient ticket sales.

===Japan===
The capital Tokyo hosted a fourth Bledisloe Test match on 31 October 2009. Each team expected to clear at least A$3.8 million/NZ$5 million from the Tokyo match.

On 27 October 2018, Bledisloe Cup returned to Japan for the second time and was hosted in Yokohama with the purpose of promoting and preparing for 2019 Rugby World Cup. All Blacks beating Wallabies 37–20 in the third test to sweep the series. The attendance figures was around 46,000 which became the record for a rugby test match in Japan. The relatively poor ticket sales included about 10% arrived via giveaways because of clashing with the fixture between Japan and World XV a day before in Osaka and lack of competitiveness of Wallabies contributing to dead rubber match of the series.

===United States===
Before the first match in Hong Kong, the two countries&#x27; rugby federations were considering taking Cup matches to the United States and Japan in 2009 and 2010. However, the proposed match in the United States did not come to fruition.

==Future proposals==
Behind the push from World Rugby with their League of Nations concept, only one match result would count for League of Nations points but the new season schedule must be able to accommodate a second Test each year in the new format. The gate receipts from Bledisloe Cup match ups are critical to both Rugby Australia and New Zealand Rugby Union and both nations are firm in their belief that one home match is mandatory. The third Bledisloe, which has long been a cash cow for both nations, could cease to exist. Any cash lost from forfeiting that match would be compensated by A$18 million per year in League of Nations broadcast revenue.

<text>A reference card or Romer is a device for increasing the accuracy when reading a grid reference from a map.

==Design and use==
Made from transparent plastic, paper or other materials, reference cards are found on most baseplate compasses. Essentially, they are a specially marked-out ruler which matches the scale of the map in use. The scales are laid out in reverse, such that by lining up the numbers given in the grid reference with the gridlines for the square in question, the corner of the Romer lies on the location the grid reference of which is being read. Some transparent versions have a small hole at the origin when this is not at the corner of the reference card. This allows access to the map such that the location could be marked with a pencil if using the reference card in reverse having been given a grid reference to start with. They are used in many types of land navigation and map reading, to give a more accurate grid reference than one just estimated by eye from the grid lines on the map.

While Romers of various designs are available commercially, they can easily be made by hand, by using a computer, or by finding a website with instructions.

==History==
Invented in 1915 by Temporary Lieutenant (later Captain) Carrol Romer, M.C., R.E. (1883–1951), then &quot;Maps&quot;, First Army: i.e. OC Maps and Printing Section, such reference cards were widely used by the British Army in World War I and after, being described in a Maps GHQ booklet &quot;Maps and Artillery Boards&quot; in December 1916. The name &#x27;Romer&#x27; seems only to have been used officially from 1929.

A version was later developed for car navigational rallies by car rally partners Eric Gardner and John Cridford during the early 1950s, the &#x27;Garford Romer&#x27; was available for both imperial and metric Ordnance Survey maps and is still sold today. Although a registered design when it was first made and sold it was and still is much copied.

<doc id="227284" wikidata="Q766057" url="?curid=227284" title="Lachesis (genus)">
<text>Lachesis (also known commonly as the bushmasters) is a genus of pit vipers in the family Viperidae. Member species are found in forested areas of the Neotropics. The generic name refers to one of the Three Fates, Lachesis (in Greek mythology), who determined the length of the thread of life. Four species are currently recognized as being valid.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Lachesis&quot; was traditionally composed of only three species, but Campbell and (2004) recognized a fourth species, &quot;L. acrochorda&quot; (, 1896), referring to it as the Chochoan bushmaster. Its evolutionary relationships are not certain, but &quot;Lachesis acrochorda&quot; is thought to be closer to &quot;L. muta&quot; than to the two Central American species &quot;L. stenophrys&quot; and &quot;L. melanocephala&quot;. 

===Species===

&quot;* Not including the nominate subspecies.&quot;
T Type species.

==Description==
Adults of the genus &quot;Lachesis&quot; typically range in total length (including tail) from , although some may grow to as much as , making &quot;Lachesis&quot; the longest genus of venomous snake in the Western Hemisphere, and the longest genus of viper in the world. &quot;L. muta&quot; is possibly the largest of the four species currently recognized, although more scant information suggests that &quot;L. stenophrys&quot; broadly overlaps in size and may average at a similar size, while &quot;L. melanocephala&quot; and &quot;L. acrochorda&quot; are apparently slightly smaller than the prior two species. Although they are not the heaviest vipers, since the Gaboon viper (&quot;Bitis gabonica&quot;) and the eastern diamondback rattlesnake (&quot;Crotalus adamanteus&quot;) are heavier, large adults can weigh . Bushmasters are sexually dimorphic in size, with males reaching larger sizes than females. The bushmasters&#x27; tail ends with a horny spine which sometimes vibrates when disturbed like rattlesnakes; due to this, it has been called &#x27;the mute rattlesnake&#x27;.

==Geographic range==
&quot;Lachesis&quot; species are found in Central and South America, as well as the island of Trinidad in the Caribbean.

==Reproduction==
Bushmasters lay eggs, about a dozen in an average clutch. The female reportedly remains with her eggs during incubation and may aggressively defend the nest if approached. The hatchlings average in length and are more colorful than the adults. &quot;Lachesis&quot; is thought to be unique among New World pit vipers by laying eggs rather than giving birth to live young, although some evidence suggests that the species &quot;Bothrocophias colombianus&quot; found in Colombia may do the same.

==Venom==
Bushmasters are capable of multiple-bite strikes and the injection of large amounts of venom. Even the bite of a juvenile specimen can be fatal to a human. However, these snakes are rarely encountered; so snakebite incidents are not common. The venom of &quot;Lachesis&quot; has several activities, such as the activation of plasminogen, leading to increased permeability of blood vessels, causing edema and lowering of blood pressure. It also has coagulant activity in which thrombin-like enzymes act on fibrinogen, forming small clots that settle in organs such as lungs and kidneys, obstructing capillary blood flow. Hemorrhagic activity is caused by metalloproteases, which damage capillary walls. Both coagulant and hemorrhagic activities act in combination, triggering local and systemic hemorrhagic disorders. Proteolytic activity is due to direct action of proteases (thrombin for example), metalloproteases, and important myotoxic and cytolytic factors. Myotoxic action occurs due to phospholipase generating an inflammatory infiltrate composed of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages around necrotic cells. Phospholipases can induce necrosis of skeletal muscle fibers. While the defibrinating action results in anticoagulant blood, the venom also has a kininogen-like action; it causes the body to release substances such as bradykinin and kallikrein inducing hypotension. Bradykinin-enhancing peptides interfere with the bradykinin metabolism causing it to last longer in the blood, leading to lasting hypotension. The venom also has a neurotoxic action, isolated from basic phospholipase, that is capable of inducing irreversible blockage of neuromuscular transmission &quot;in vitro&quot; at concentrations as low as 1 mg/ml.

==Cultural depictions==
A bushmaster snake is the antagonist in the tenth episode of the radio show &quot;Escape&quot;. The episode&#x27;s title was &quot;A Shipment of Mute Fate&quot;, and starred Jack Webb and Raymond Lawrence. It was broadcast on 15 October 1947. The story was also adapted for &quot;Suspense&quot; starring Jack Kelly, broadcast on January 6, 1957. 

Jack T. Colton killed a bushmaster in the film &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot; from 1984 when seeking shelter in a crashed plane.

A bushmaster snake bit a character in the film &quot;Primal&quot; in 2019. 

The Marvel Comics supervillain Bushmaster is named after the genus.

The following weapons and military vehicles are named after this viper:
* Bushmaster XM-15, an AR-15 style rifle manufactured by Bushmaster Firearms International;
* M242 Bushmaster, a chain gun manufactured by Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems;
* Bushmaster IMV, an Australian infantry mobility vehicle; 
* A variant of the amphibious Landing Vehicle Tracked introduced in 1944, the LVT-3 Bushmaster.

<text>Basketball contests at the 1968 Summer Olympics was the seventh appearance of the sport of basketball as an official Olympic medal event. It took place at the Palacio de los Deportes in Mexico City, Mexico from October 13 to October 25, 1968. The United States defeated Yugoslavia to win their seventh consecutive gold medal in this sport, while the Soviet Union earned the bronze against Brazil. 

The Americans&#x27; record of seven basketball gold medals in a row was matched by their women&#x27;s team in 2021 when they won the 2020 Olympics and then broken by the women&#x27;s team in 2024.

==Medal summary==
==Qualification==
Automatic qualifications were granted to the host country and the first five places at the previous tournament. Additional spots were decided by various continental tournaments held by FIBA plus two additional tournaments that granted two extra berths each.

==Format==
* Two groups of eight teams are formed, where the top two from each group compete for the medals in a knockout round.
* The remaining places are defined as follows:
**Fifth through eighth places are decided in a separate bracket between the third and fourth places from each group in a separate bracket.
**Ninth through sixteenth places are decided between the fifth through eighth places from each group in separate brackets.

==Squads==
For the team rosters see: &quot;Basketball at the 1968 Summer Olympics – Men&#x27;s team rosters&quot;.

==Preliminary round==
The top two teams from each group advance to the semifinals, while the remaining teams compete for 5th through 16th places in separate brackets. Both group leaders, the United States and the Soviet Union advanced undefeated to the knockout stage.

<text>Gregory Nunzio Corso (March 26, 1930 – January 17, 2001) was an American poet. Along with Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, and William S. Burroughs, he was part of the Beat Generation, as well as one of its youngest members.

== Early life ==

Born Nunzio Corso at New York City&#x27;s St. Vincent&#x27;s Hospital, Corso later selected the name &quot;Gregory&quot; as a confirmation name. Within Little Italy and its community he was &quot;Nunzio,&quot; while he dealt with others as &quot;Gregory.&quot; He often would use &quot;Nunzio&quot; as short for &quot;Annunziato,&quot; the announcing angel Gabriel, hence a poet. Corso identified with not only Gabriel but also Hermes, the divine messenger.

Corso&#x27;s mother, Michelina Corso (born Colonna), was born in Miglianico, Abruzzo, Italy, and immigrated to the United States at the age of nine, with her mother and four other sisters. At 16, she married Sam Corso, a first-generation Italian American, also teenage, and gave birth to Nunzio Corso the same year. They lived at the corner of Bleecker and MacDougal streets, the heart of Greenwich Village and upper Little Italy.

=== Childhood ===
Sometime in his first year, Corso&#x27;s mother mysteriously abandoned him, leaving him at the New York child care 
home, a branch of the Catholic Church Charities. Corso&#x27;s father, Sam &quot;Fortunato&quot; Corso, a garment center worker, found the infant and promptly put him in a foster home. Michelina came to New York from Trenton but her life was threatened by Sam. One of Michelina&#x27;s sisters was married to a New Jersey mobster who offered to give Michelina her &quot;vengeance,&quot; that is to kill Sam. Michelina declined and returned to Trenton without her child. Sam consistently told Corso that his mother had returned to Italy and deserted the family. He was also told that she was a prostitute and was &quot;disgraziata&quot; (disgraced) and forced into Italian exile. Sam told the young boy several times, &quot;I should have flushed you down the toilet.&quot; It was 67 years before Corso learned the truth of his mother&#x27;s disappearance.

Corso spent the next 11 years in foster care in at least five different homes. His father rarely visited him. When he did, Corso was often abused: &quot;I&#x27;d spill jello, and the foster home people would beat me. Then my father would visit, and he&#x27;d beat me again—a double whammy.&quot; As a foster child, Corso was among thousands that the Church aided during the Great Depression, with the intention of reconstituting families as the economy picked up. Corso went to Catholic parochial schools, was an altar boy and a gifted student. His father, in order to avoid the military draft, brought Gregory home in 1941. Nevertheless, Sam Corso was drafted and sent overseas.

Corso, then alone, became a homeless child on the streets of Little Italy. For warmth he slept in subways in the winter, and then slept on rooftops during the summer. He continued to attend Catholic school, not telling authorities he was living on the streets. With permission, he took breakfast bread from a bakery in Little Italy. Street food stall merchants would give him food in exchange for running errands.

=== Adolescence ===
At age 13, Corso was asked to deliver a toaster to a neighbor. While he was running the errand, a passerby offered money (around 94 dollars) for the toaster, and Corso sold it. He used the money to buy a tie and white shirt, and dressed up to see &quot;The Song of Bernadette&quot;, a movie about the mystical appearance of the Virgin Mary to Bernadette Soubirous at Lourdes. On returning from the movie, the police apprehended him. Corso claimed he was seeking a miracle, namely to find his mother. Corso had a lifelong affection for saints and holy men: &quot;They were my only heroes.&quot; Nonetheless, he was arrested for petty larceny and incarcerated in The Tombs, New York&#x27;s infamous jail. Corso, though only 13 years old, was celled next to an adult, criminally insane murderer who had stabbed his wife repeatedly with a screwdriver. The exposure left Corso traumatized. Neither Corso&#x27;s stepmother nor his paternal grandmother would post his $50 bond. With his own mother missing and unable to make bail, he remained in the Tombs.

Later, in 1944 during a New York blizzard, a 14-year-old freezing Corso broke into his tutor&#x27;s office for warmth, and fell asleep on a desk. He slept through the blizzard and was arrested for breaking and entering and booked into the Tombs for a second time with adults. Terrified of other inmates, he was sent to the psychiatric ward of Bellevue Hospital Center and later released.

On the eve of his 18th birthday, Corso broke into a tailor shop and stole an oversized suit to dress for a date. Police records indicate he was arrested two blocks from the shop. He spent the night in the Tombs and was arraigned the next morning as an 18-year-old with prior offenses. No longer a &quot;youthful offender,&quot; he was given a two to three years sentence to Clinton State Prison in Dannemora, New York. Corso always has expressed a curious gratitude for Clinton making him a poet.

&quot;Gasoline&quot;, his second book of poems, is dedicated to &quot;the angels of Clinton Prison who, in my seventeenth year, handed me, from all the cells surrounding me, books of illumination.&quot;

=== Corso at Clinton Correctional ===
While being transported to Clinton, Corso, terrified of prison and the prospect of rape, concocted a story of why he was sent there. He told hardened Clinton inmates he and two friends had devised the wild plan of taking over New York City by means of walkie-talkies, projecting a series of improbable and complex robberies. Communicating by walkie-talkie, each of the three boys took up an assigned position—one inside the store to be robbed, one outside on the street to watch for the police, and a third, Corso, the master-planner, in a small room nearby dictating the orders. According to Corso, he was in the small room giving the orders when the police came. In light of Corso&#x27;s youth, his imaginative yarn earned him bemused attention at Clinton. Richard Biello, a capo, asked Corso who he was connected with, that is what New York crime family did he come from, talking such big crimes as walkie-talkie robberies. &quot;I&#x27;m independent!&quot; Corso shot back, hoping to keep his distance from the mob inmates. A week later, in the prison showers, Corso was grabbed by a handful of inmates, and the 18-year-old was about to be raped. Biello happened in and commented, &quot;Corso! You don&#x27;t look so independent right now.&quot; Biello waved off the would-be rapists, who were afraid of mafia reprisals.

Thus Corso fell under the protection of powerful Mafioso inmates, and became something of a mascot because he was the youngest inmate in the prison, and he was entertaining. Corso would cook the steaks and veal brought from the outside by mafia underlings in the &quot;courts&quot;, 55-gallon-barrel barbecues and picnic tables, assigned to the influential prisoners. Clinton also had a ski run right in the middle of &quot;the yards,&quot; and Corso learned to downhill ski and taught the mafiosi. He entertained his mobster elders as a court jester, quick with ripostes and japes. Corso would often cite the three propositions given him by a mafia capo: &quot;1) Don&#x27;t serve time, let time serve you. 2) Don&#x27;t take your shoes off because with a two to three you&#x27;re walking right out of here. 3) When you&#x27;re in the yard talking to three guys, see four. See yourself. Dig yourself.&quot;
Corso was jailed in the very cell just months before vacated by Charles &quot;Lucky&quot; Luciano. While imprisoned, Luciano had donated an extensive library to the prison. (&quot;Poet&#x27;s Work, Poet&#x27;s Play: Essays on the Practice and the Art.&quot; 2008).

 The cell was also equipped with a phone and self-controlled lighting as Luciano was, from prison, cooperating with the U.S. government&#x27;s wartime effort, providing mafia aid in policing the New York waterfront, and later helping in Naples, Italy through his control of the Camorra. In this special cell, Corso read after lights-out thanks to a light specially positioned for Luciano to work late. Corso was encouraged to read and study by his Cosa Nostra mentors, who recognized his genius.

There, Corso began writing poetry. He studied the Greek and Roman classics, and voraciously absorbed encyclopedia and dictionary entries. He credited &quot;The Story of Civilization&quot;, Will and Ariel Durant&#x27;s ground-breaking compendium of history and philosophy, for his general education and philosophical sophistication.

=== Release and return to New York City ===
In 1951, 21-year-old Gregory Corso worked in the garment center by day, and at night was a mascot yet again, this time at one of Greenwich Village&#x27;s first lesbian bars, the Pony Stable Inn. The women gave Corso a table at which he wrote poetry. One night a Columbia College student, Allen Ginsberg, happened into the Pony Stable and saw Corso... &quot;he was good looking, and wondered if he was gay, or what.&quot; Corso, who was not gay, was not uncomfortable with same sex come-ons after his time in prison, and thought he could score a beer off Ginsberg. He showed Ginsberg some of the poems he was writing, a number of them from prison, and Ginsberg immediately recognized Corso as &quot;spiritually gifted.&quot; One poem described a woman who sunbathed in a window bay across the street from Corso&#x27;s room on 12th Street. The woman happened to be Ginsberg&#x27;s erstwhile girl friend, with whom he lived in one of his rare forays into heterosexuality. Ginsberg invited Corso back to their apartment and asked the woman if she would satisfy Corso&#x27;s sexual curiosity. She agreed, but Corso, still a virgin, got too nervous as she disrobed, and he ran from the apartment, struggling with his pants. Ginsberg and Corso became fast friends. All his life, Ginsberg had a sexual attraction to Corso, which remained unrequited.

Corso joined the Beat circle and was adopted by its co-leaders, Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg, who saw in the young street-wise writer a potential for expressing the poetic insights of a generation wholly separate from those preceding it. At this time he developed a crude and fragmented mastery of Shelley, Marlowe, and Chatterton. Shelley&#x27;s A Defence of Poetry (1821, posthumously published in 1840), with its emphasis on the ability of genuine poetic impulse to stimulate &quot;unapprehended combinations of thought&quot; that led to the &quot;moral improvement of man,&quot; prompted Corso to develop a theory of poetry roughly consistent with that of the developing principles of the Beat poets. For Corso, poetry became a vehicle for change, a way to redirect the course of society by stimulating individual will. He referred to Shelley often as a &quot;Revolutionary of Spirit&quot;, which he considered Ginsberg and himself to be.

=== Cambridge, Massachusetts ===
In 1954, Corso moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where several important poets, including Edward Marshall (poet) and John Wieners, were experimenting with the poetics of voice. The center for Corso&#x27;s life there was not &quot;the School of Boston,&quot; as these poets were called, but Harvard University&#x27;s Widener Library. He spent his days there reading the great works of poetry and also auditing classes in the Greek and Roman Classics. Corso&#x27;s appreciation of the classics had come from the Durants&#x27; books that he had read in prison. At Harvard, he considered becoming a classics scholar. Corso, penniless, lived on a dorm room floor in Elliott house, welcomed by students Peter Sourian, Bobby Sedgwick (brother of Edie), and Paul Grand. He would dress up for dinner and not be noticed. Members of the elite Porcellian Club reported Corso to the Harvard administration as an interloper. Dean Archibald MacLeish met with Corso intending to expel him, but Corso showed him his poems and MacLeish relented and allowed Corso to be a non-matriculating student—a poet in residence. Corso&#x27;s first published poems appeared in the Harvard Advocate in 1954, and his play &quot;In This Hung-up Age&quot;—concerning a group of Americans who, after their bus breaks down midway across the continent, are trampled by buffalo—was performed by the esteemed Poets&#x27; Theater the following year along with T.S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;Murder in the Cathedral.&quot;

Harvard and Radcliffe students, notably Grand, Sourian and Sedgwick, underwrote the printing expenses of Corso&#x27;s first book, &quot;The Vestal Lady on Brattle, and Other Poems&quot;. The poems featured in the volume are usually considered apprentice work heavily indebted to Corso&#x27;s reading. They are, however, unique in their innovative use of jazz rhythms—most notably in &quot;Requiem for &#x27;Bird&#x27; Parker, musician,&quot; which many call the strongest poem in the book—cadences of spoken English, and hipster jargon. Corso once explained his use of rhythm and meter in an interview with Gavin Selerie for Riverside Interviews: &quot;My music is built in—it&#x27;s already natural. I don&#x27;t play with the meter.&quot; In other words, Corso believed the meter must arise naturally from the poet&#x27;s voice; it is never consciously chosen.

In a review of &quot;The Vestal Lady on Brattle&quot; for &quot;Poetry&quot;, Reuel Denney asked whether &quot;a small group jargon&quot; such as bop language would &quot;sound interesting&quot; to those who were not part of that culture. Corso, he concluded, &quot;cannot balance the richness of the bebop group jargon... with the clarity he needs to make his work meaningful to a wider-than-clique audience.&quot; Ironically, within a few years, that &quot;small group jargon&quot;, the Beat lingo, became a national idiom, featuring words such as &quot;man,&quot; &quot;cool,&quot; &quot;dig,&quot; &quot;chick,&quot; &quot;hung up,&quot; etc.

Despite Corso&#x27;s reliance on traditional forms and archaic diction, he remained a street-wise poet, described by Bruce Cook in &quot;The Beat Generation&quot; as &quot;an urchin Shelley.&quot; Biographer Carolyn Gaiser suggested that Corso adopted &quot;the mask of the sophisticated child whose every display of mad spontaneity and bizarre perception is consciously and effectively designed&quot;—as if he is in some way deceiving his audience. But the poems at their best are controlled by an authentic, distinctive, and enormously effective voice that can range from sentimental affection and pathos to exuberance and dadaist irreverence toward almost anything except poetry itself. Marian Janssen, in her biography of Isabella Gardner, details the relationships that Corso established with the more traditional literary society at the onset of his career. During his time at Cambridge, Corso met Robert Gardner, a member of the elite upper class “Boston Brahmins.” Gardner became a sponsor of sorts to Corso and briefly provided him with financial support. It was Robert Gardner who suggested to Corso that he send one of his poems to his sister, Isabella, who was a noted poet and the assistant editor of Poetry Magazine. Isabella liked the poem and asked Corso to send her three or four more before she took the poems to the editor, Karl Shapiro. Shapiro rejected Corso&#x27;s poetry and he never appeared in Poetry Magazine while Shapiro was the editor. Gardener sent a letter back to Corso that managed to “salve his poetic pride” and began a lasting but difficult correspondence between the two poets.

=== San Francisco, &quot;Howl&quot;, and the Beat Phenomenon ===
Corso and Ginsberg decided to head to San Francisco, separately. Corso wound up temporarily in Los Angeles and worked at the &quot;L.A. Examiner&quot; news morgue. Ginsberg was delayed in Denver. They were drawn by reports of an iconoclast circle of poets, including Gary Snyder, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Michael McClure, Philip Whalen and Lew Welch. An older literary mentor, the socialist writer Kenneth Rexroth, lent his apartment as a Friday-night literary salon (Ginsberg&#x27;s mentor William Carlos Williams, an old friend of Rexroth&#x27;s, had given him an introductory letter).

Wally Hedrick wanted to organize the famous Six Gallery reading, and Ginsberg wanted Rexroth to serve as master of ceremonies, in a sense to bridge generations. Philip Lamantia, Michael McClure, Philip Whalen, Allen Ginsberg and Gary Snyder read on October 7, 1955, before 100 people (including Kerouac, up from Mexico City). Lamantia read poems of his late friend John Hoffman. At his first public reading Ginsberg performed the just-finished first part of &quot;Howl.&quot; Gregory Corso arrived late the next day, missing the historic reading, at which he had been scheduled to read.

The Six Gallery was a success, and the evening led to many more readings by the now locally famous Six Gallery poets. It was also a marker of the beginning of the West Coast Beat movement, since the 1956 publication of &quot;Howl&quot; (City Lights Pocket Poets, no. 4) and its obscenity trial in 1957 brought it to nationwide attention.

Ginsberg and Corso hitchhiked from San Francisco, visiting Henry Miller in Big Sur, and stopped off in Los Angeles. As guests of Anaïs Nin and writer Lawrence Lipton, Corso and Ginsberg gave a reading to a gathering of L.A. literati. Ginsberg took the audience off-guard, by proclaiming himself and Corso as poets of absolute honesty, and they both proceeded to strip bare naked of clothes, shocking even the most avant-garde of the audience.

Corso and Ginsberg then hitchhiked to Mexico City to visit Kerouac who was holed up in a room above a whorehouse, writing a novel, &quot;Tristessa.&quot; After a three-week stay in Mexico City, Ginsberg left, and Corso waited for a plane ticket. His lover, Hope Savage, convinced her father, Henry Savage Jr., the mayor of Camden, S.C., to send Corso a plane ticket to Washington, D.C. Corso had been invited by the Library of Congress poet (precursor to U.S. Poet Laureate) Randall Jarrell and his wife Mary, to live with them, and become Jarrell&#x27;s poetic protege. Jarrell, unimpressed with the other Beats, found Corso&#x27;s work to be original and believed he held great promise. Corso stayed with the Jarrells for two months, enjoying the first taste of family life ever. However, Kerouac showed up and crashed at the Jarrells&#x27;, often drunk and loud, and got Corso to carouse with him. Corso was disinvited by the Jarrells and returned to New York.

== To Paris and the &quot;Beat Hotel&quot; ==
In 1957, Allen Ginsberg traveled with Peter Orlovsky to visit William S. Burroughs in Morocco. They were joined by Kerouac, who was researching the French origins of his family. Corso, already in Europe, joined them in Tangiers and, as a group, they made an ill-fated attempt to take Burroughs&#x27; fragmented writings and organize them into a text (which later would become &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;). Burroughs was strung out on heroin and became jealous of Ginsberg&#x27;s unrequited attraction for Corso, who left Tangiers for Paris. In Paris, Corso introduced Ginsberg and Orlovsky to a Left Bank lodging house above a bar at 9 rue Gît-le-Cœur, that he named the Beat Hotel. They were soon joined by William Burroughs and others. It was a haven for young expatriate painters, writers, and musicians. There, Ginsberg began his epic poem &quot;Kaddish&quot;, Corso composed his poems &quot;Bomb&quot; and &quot;Marriage&quot;, and Burroughs (with Brion Gysin&#x27;s help) put together &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; from previous writings. This period was documented by the photographer Harold Chapman, who moved in at about the same time, and took pictures of the residents of the hotel until it closed in 1963.

Corso&#x27;s Paris sojourn resulted in his third volume of poetry, &quot;The Happy Birthday of Death&quot; (1960), &quot;Minutes to Go&quot; (1960, visual poetry deemed &quot;cut-ups&quot;) with William S. Burroughs, Sinclair Beiles, and Brion Gysin, &quot;The American Express&quot; (1961, an Olympia Press novel), and &quot;Long Live Man&quot; (1962, poetry). Corso fell out with the publisher of &quot;Gasoline&quot;, Lawrence Ferlinghetti of City Lights Bookstore, who objected to &quot;Bomb,&quot; a position Ferlinghetti later rued and for which he apologized. Corso&#x27;s work found a strong reception at New Directions Publishing, founded by James Laughlin, who had heard of Corso through Harvard connections. New Directions was considered the premier publisher of poetry, with Ezra Pound, Dylan Thomas, Marianne Moore, Wallace Stevens, Thomas Merton, Denise Levertov, James Agee, and ironically, Lawrence Ferlinghetti. Corso also wrote again to Isabella Gardner while in Paris after he read her book of poems, &quot;Birthdays from the Ocean&quot;. Corso&#x27;s extreme enthusiasm for her work was returned with indifference. Gardner was in the midst of an affair with Allen Tate, one of the leading members of the New Criticism, and his negative opinion of Beat poets influenced Gardner&#x27;s response to Corso. While in Europe Corso searched for his lover, Hope Savage, who had disappeared from New York, saying she was headed to Paris. He visited Rome and Greece, sold encyclopedias in Germany, hung out with jazz trumpeter Chet Baker in Amsterdam, and with Ginsberg set the staid Oxford Union in turmoil with his reading of &quot;Bomb,&quot; which the Oxford students mistakenly believed was pro-nuclear war (as had Ferlinghetti), while they and other campuses were engaged in &quot;ban the bomb&quot; demonstrations. A student threw a shoe at Corso, and both he and Ginsberg left before Ginsberg could read &quot;Howl.&quot;

Corso returned to New York in 1958, amazed that he and his compatriots had become famous, or notorious, emerging literary figures.

== Return to New York – The &quot;Beatniks&quot; ==
In late 1958, Corso reunited with Ginsberg and Orlovsky. They were astonished that before they left for Europe they had sparked a social movement, which San Francisco columnist Herb Caen called &quot;Beat-nik,&quot; combining &quot;beat&quot; with the Russian &quot;Sputnik,&quot; as if to suggest that the Beat writers were both &quot;out there&quot; and vaguely Communist.

San Francisco&#x27;s obscenity trial of Lawrence Ferlinghetti for publishing Ginsberg&#x27;s &quot;Howl&quot; had ended in an acquittal, and the national notoriety made &quot;The Beats&quot; famous, adored and ridiculed.

Upon their return, Ginsberg, Corso, Kerouac and Burroughs were published in the venerable &quot;Chicago Review&quot;, but before the volume was sold, University of Chicago President Robert Hutchins deemed it pornographic and had all copies confiscated. The Chicago editors promptly resigned and started an alternative literary magazine, &quot;Big Table&quot;. Ginsberg and Corso took a bus from New York for the &quot;Big Table&quot; launch, which again propelled them into the national spotlight. Studs Terkel&#x27;s interview of the two was a madcap romp which set off a wave of publicity. Controversy followed them and they relished making the most of their outlaw and pariah image. &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Life&quot; magazines had a particular dislike of the two, hurling invective and insult that Corso and Ginsberg hoped they could bootstrap into yet more publicity. The Beat Generation (so named by Kerouac) was galvanized and young people began dressing with berets, toreador pants, and beards, and carrying bongos. Corso would quip that he never grew a beard, didn&#x27;t own a beret, and couldn&#x27;t fathom bongos.

Corso and Ginsberg traveled widely to college campuses, reading together. Ginsberg&#x27;s &quot;Howl&quot; provided the serious fare and Corso&#x27;s &quot;Bomb&quot; and &quot;Marriage&quot; provided the humor and bonhomie. New York&#x27;s Beat scene erupted and spilled over to the burgeoning folk music craze in the Village, Corso&#x27;s and Ginsberg&#x27;s home ground. An early participant was a newly arrived Bob Dylan: &quot;I came out of the wilderness and just fell in with the Beat scene, the Bohemian, the Be Bop crowd. It was all pretty connected.&quot; &quot;It was Jack Kerouac, Ginsberg, Corso, Ferlinghetti... I got in at the tail end of that and it was magic.&quot; -&quot;Bob Dylan in America.&quot;

Corso also published in the avant garde little magazine &quot;Nomad&quot; at the beginning of the 1960s.

During the early 1960s, Corso married Sally November, an English teacher who grew up in Cleveland, Ohio and attended Shaker High School, and graduated from the University of Michigan. At first, Corso mimicked &quot;Marriage&quot; and moved to Cleveland to work in Sally&#x27;s father&#x27;s florist shop. Then the couple lived in Manhattan and Sally was known to Allen Ginsberg, Peter Orlovsky, Larry Rivers and others in the beat circle at that time. The marriage, while a failure, did produce a child, Miranda Corso. Corso maintained contact with Sally and his daughter sporadically during his lifetime. Sally, who subsequently remarried, resides on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and has kept contact with one of the iconic females associated with the Beat movement, Hettie Jones.

Corso married two other times and had sons and a daughter.

As the Beats were supplanted in the 1960s by the Hippies and other youth movements, Corso experienced his own wilderness years. He struggled with alcohol and drugs. He later would comment that his addictions masked the pain of having been abandoned and emotionally deprived and abused. Poetry was his purest means of transcending his traumas, but substance abuse threatened his poetic output. He lived in Rome for many years, and later married in Paris and taught in Greece, all the while traveling widely. He strangely remained close to the Catholic Church as critic and had a loose identification as a lapsed Catholic. His collection &quot;Dear Fathers&quot; was several letters commenting on needed reforms in the Vatican.

In 1969, Corso published a volume, &quot;Elegiac Feelings American&quot;, whose lead poem, dedicated to the recently deceased Jack Kerouac, is regarded by some critics as Corso&#x27;s best poem. In 1981 he published poems mostly written while residing in Europe, entitled &quot;Herald of the Autochthonic Spirit&quot;.
In 1972, Rose Holton and her sister met Corso on the second day of their residence at the Hotel Chelsea in New York City:

He sold us on the Chelsea and sold us on himself. Everything that life can throw at you was reflected in his very being. It was impossible for him to be boring. He was outrageous, always provocative, alternately full of indignation or humor, never censoring his words or behavior. But the main thing is that Gregory was authentic. He could play to the audience, but he was never a phony poseur. He was the real deal. He once explained the trajectory of creative achievement: &#x27;There is talent, there is genius, then there is the divine.&#x27; Gregory inhabited the &quot;divine&quot;.

While living at the Chelsea, Corso encountered Isabella Gardner once again. She had moved there after her relationship with Tate ended. In one of the most curious events of his life, Corso blamed her for his lack of writing as his career progressed. He claimed that Gardner had stolen two suitcases from him while they were both at the Chelsea. Corso claimed that the suitcases contained two books of new poetry and all his correspondence between himself and the other Beat poets. Although his claims were clearly false, he valued the suitcases at two thousand dollars and extorted this money from Gardner.

== Poetry ==
Corso&#x27;s first volume of poetry &quot;The Vestal Lady on Brattle&quot; was published in 1955 (with the assistance of students at Harvard, where he had been auditing classes). Corso was the second member of the Beats to be published, despite the fact that he was the youngest member of the group. (Jack Kerouac&#x27;s The Town and the City was published in February 1950.) His poems were first published in the &quot;Harvard Advocate&quot;. In 1958, Corso had an expanded collection of poems published as number 8 in the City Lights Pocket Poets Series: &quot;Gasoline &amp; The Vestal Lady on Brattle&quot;. Corso&#x27;s notable poems include the following: &quot;Bomb,&quot;&quot;Elegiac Feelings American,&quot; &quot;Marriage,&quot; and &quot;The Whole Mess... Almost.&quot;

=== Marriage ===
&quot;Marriage&quot; (1960) is perhaps Corso&#x27;s signature poem. It is a 111-line work that lacks a consistent narrative thread. Instead, it offers a rambling debate about the advantages and disadvantages of marriage. It employs a free verse style, with no set meter, no set rhyme scheme, and varying line lengths. Corso acknowledges the length of some of the lines, but argues &quot;they just flow, like a musical thing within me.&quot; &quot;Marriage&quot; was among his &quot;title poems,&quot; along with &quot;Power,&quot; &quot;Army,&quot; and others that explore a concept. &quot;Should I get married?&quot; (1), the speaker begins. Could marriage bring about the results that the speaker is looking for? Coming &quot;home to her&quot; (54) and sitting &quot;by the fireplace and she in the kitchen/aproned young and lovely wanting my baby/ and so happy about me she burns the roast beef&quot; (55–57). Idealizing marriage and fatherhood initially, Corso&#x27;s speaker embraces reality in the second half of the poem admitting, &quot;No, I doubt I&#x27;d be that kind of father&quot; (84). Recognizing that the act of marriage is in itself a form of imprisonment, &quot;No, can&#x27;t imagine myself married to that pleasant prison dream&quot; (103), Corso&#x27;s speaker acknowledges in the end that the possibility of marriage is not promising for him. Bruce Cook, in &quot;The Beat Generation &quot; illuminates Corso&#x27;s skill at juxtaposing humor and serious critical commentary: &quot;Yet as funny and entertaining as all this certainly is, it is not merely that, for in its zany way &#x27;Marriage&#x27; offers serious criticism of what is phony about a sacred American institution.&quot;

&quot;Marriage&quot; excerpt:

&lt;poem&gt;
Should I get married? Should I be good?
Astound the girl next door with my velvet suit and faustus hood?
Don&#x27;t take her to movies but to cemeteries
tell all about werewolf bathtubs and forked clarinets
then desire her and kiss her and all the preliminaries
and she going just so far and I understanding why
not getting angry saying You must feel! It&#x27;s beautiful to feel!
Instead take her in my arms lean against an old crooked tombstone
and woo her the entire night the constellations in the sky—
When she introduces me to her parents
back straightened, hair finally combed, strangled by a tie,
should I sit knees together on their 3rd degree sofa
and not ask Where&#x27;s the bathroom?
How else to feel other than I am,
often thinking Flash Gordon soap—
O how terrible it must be for a young man
seated before a family and the family thinking
We never saw him before! He wants our Mary Lou!
After tea and homemade cookies they ask What do you do for a living?
Should I tell them? Would they like me then?
Say All right get married, we&#x27;re not losing a daughter
but we&#x27;re gaining a son—
And should I then ask Where&#x27;s the bathroom?
O God, and the wedding! All her family and her friends
and only a handful of mine all scroungy and bearded
just wait to get at the drinks and food—&lt;/poem&gt;

Corso&#x27;s sometimes surreal word mash-ups in the poem—&quot;forked clarinets,&quot; &quot;Flash Gordon soap,&quot; &quot;werewolf bathtubs&quot;—caught the attention of many. Ethan Hawke recited the poem in the 1994 film &quot;Reality Bites&quot;, and Corso later thanked Hawke for the resulting royalty check.

=== Bomb ===
According to Catharine Seigel, Corso&#x27;s &quot;Bomb&quot; (published in 1958), was one of the earliest poems to confront the existence of the nuclear bomb. The poem was published as a multiple-paged broadside, with the text shaped as a mushroom cloud. The first 30 lines create a round mushroom top, while lines 30-190 create the pillar of debris and destruction rising up from the ground. Corso recalled the tradition of patterned or shape poetry, but made the irreverent choice to create the shape of the cloud that results from the detonation of a nuclear bomb. Previous uses of shape poetry include angel wings and altars, which Siegel says makes Corso&#x27;s choice &quot;ironically appropriate.&quot; The poem appeared in the volume &quot;The Happy Birthday of Death,&quot; which featured a black and white photograph of the mushroom cloud over Hiroshima, Japan.

Corso makes extensive use of onomatopoeia toward the end of the poem, with all-caps font exclaiming &quot;BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM&quot; (166). Siegel describes these interruptions as &quot;attempting to sound the reign of a nuclear, apocalyptic chaos.&quot; According to Corso himself, &quot;When it&#x27;s read, it&#x27;s a sound poem.
&quot;Bomb&quot; was controversial because it mixed humor and politics. The poem was initially misinterpreted by many as being supportive of nuclear war. The opening lines of the poem tend to lead the reader to believe that Corso supported the bomb. He writes, &quot;You Bomb /Toy of universe Grandest of all snatched-sky I cannot hate you [extra spaces Corso&#x27;s]&quot; (lines 2–3). The speaker goes on to state that he cannot hate the bomb just as he cannot hate other instruments of violence, such as clubs, daggers, and St. Michael&#x27;s burning sword. He continues on to point out that people would rather die by any other means including the electric chair, but death is death no matter how it happens. The poem moves on to other death imagery and at time becomes a prayer to the bomb. The speaker offers to bring mythological roses, a gesture that evokes an image of a suitor at the door. The other suitors courting the bomb include Oppenheimer and Einstein, scientists who are responsible for the creation of the bomb. He concludes the poem with the idea that more bombs will be made &quot;and they&#x27;ll sit plunk on earth&#x27;s grumpy empires/ fierce with moustaches of gold&quot; (lines 87–8).

Christine Hoff Kraemer states the idea succinctly, &quot;The bomb is a reality; death is a reality, and for Corso, the only reasonable reaction is to embrace, celebrate, and laugh with the resulting chaos&quot; (&quot;The Brake of Time: Corso&#x27;s Bomb as Postmodern God(dess)&quot;). Kraemer also asserts, &quot;Corso gives the reader only one clue to interpreting this mishmash of images: the association of disparate objects is always presented in conjunction with the exploding bomb&quot; (&quot;The Brake of Time: Corso&#x27;s Bomb as Postmodern God(dess)&quot;). In addition she points to Corso&#x27;s denial that the poem contained political significance. Instead, he describes the poem as a &quot;death shot&quot; that pokes fun at the preoccupation with death by bomb in the 1950s when death by other causes is much more likely. This irreverent, humorous approach is characteristic of the Beat movement.

&quot;Bomb&quot; and &quot;Marriage&quot; caught the eye of a young Bob Dylan, still in Minnesota. Dylan said, &quot;The Gregory Corso poem &#x27;Bomb&#x27; was more to the point and touched the spirit of the times better—a wasted world and totally mechanized—a lot of hustle and bustle—a lot of shelves to clean, boxes to stack. I wasn&#x27;t going to pin my hopes on that.&quot;

=== Corso in other poetry ===
In contrast to Corso&#x27;s use of marriage as a synecdoche for a Beat view of women, postmodern feminist poet Hedwig Gorski chronicles a night with Corso in her poem &quot;Could not get Gregory Corso out of my Car&quot; (1985, Austin, Texas) showing the womanizing typical for heterosexual Beat behavior. Gorski criticizes the Beat movement for tokenism towards women writers and their work, with very few exceptions, including Anne Waldman, and post-beats like Diane DiPrima and herself. Male domination and womanizing by its heterosexual members, along with tokenism by its major homosexual members characterize the Beat Literary Movement. Beats scoffed at the Feminist Movement which offered liberalizing social and professional views of women and their works as did the Beat Movement for men, especially homosexuals. Corso however always defended women&#x27;s role in the Beat Generation, often citing his lover, Hope Savage, as a primary influence on him and Allen Ginsberg.

=== Relationship with the Beat Movement ===
The battle against social conformity and literary tradition was central to the work of the Beats. This group of poets questioned mainstream politics and culture, and they were concerned with changing consciousness and defying conventional writing. Corso&#x27;s poems &quot;Marriage&quot; and &quot;Bomb&quot; demonstrate his willingness to provide an unconventional, humorous, and irreverent perspective on serious or controversial topics.

Ted Morgan described Corso&#x27;s place in the Beat literary world: &quot;If Ginsberg, Kerouac and Burroughs were the Three Musketeers of the movement, Corso was their D&#x27;Artagnan, a sort of junior partner, accepted and appreciated, but with less than complete parity. He had not been in at the start, which was the alliance of the Columbia intellectuals with the Times Square hipsters. He was a recent adherent, although his credentials were impressive enough to gain him unrestricted admittance ...&quot; It has taken 50 years and the death of the other Beats, for Corso to be fully appreciated as a poet of equal stature and significance.

== Later years ==
In later years, Corso disliked public appearances and became irritated with his own &quot;Beat&quot; celebrity. He never allowed a biographer to work in any &quot;authorized&quot; fashion, and only posthumously was a volume of letters published under the specious artifice of &quot;An Accidental Autobiography&quot;. He did, however, agree to allow filmmaker Gustave Reininger to make a cinema vérité documentary, &quot;&quot;, about him.

Corso had a cameo appearance in &quot;The Godfather III&quot; where he plays an outraged stockholder trying to speak at a meeting.

After Allen Ginsberg&#x27;s death, Corso was depressed and despondent. Gustave Reininger convinced him to go &quot;on the road&quot; to Europe and retrace the early days of &quot;the Beats&quot; in Paris, Italy and Greece. While in Venice, Corso expressed on film his lifelong concerns about not having a mother and living such an uprooted childhood. Corso became curious about where in Italy his mother, Michelina Colonna, might be buried. His father&#x27;s family had always told him that his mother had returned to Italy a disgraced woman, a whore. Filmmaker Gustave Reininger quietly launched a search for Corso&#x27;s mother&#x27;s Italian burial place. In an astonishing turn of events, Reininger found Corso&#x27;s mother Michelina not dead, but alive; and not in Italy, but in Trenton, New Jersey. Corso was reunited with his mother on film. He discovered that she at the age of 17 had been almost fatally brutalized (all her front teeth punched out) and was sexually abused by her teenage husband, his father. On film, Michelina explained that, at the height of the Depression, with no trade or job, she had no choice but to give her son into the care of Catholic Charities. After she had established a new life working in a restaurant in New Jersey, she had attempted to find him, to no avail. The father, Sam Corso, had blocked even Catholic Charities from disclosing the boy&#x27;s whereabouts. Living modestly, she lacked the means to hire a lawyer to find her son. She worked as a waitress in a sandwich shop in the New Jersey State Office Building in Trenton. She eventually married the cook, Paul Davita, and started a new family. Her child Gregory remained a secret between Michelina and her mother and sisters, until Reininger found them.

Corso and his mother quickly developed a relationship which lasted until his death, which preceded hers. They both spent hours on the phone, and the initial forgiveness displayed in the film became a living reality. Corso and Michelina loved to gamble and on several occasions took vacations to Atlantic City for blackjack at the casinos. Corso always lost, while Michelina fared better and would stake him with her winnings.
Corso claimed that he was healed in many ways by meeting his mother and saw his life coming full circle. He began to work productively on a new, long-delayed volume of poetry, &quot;The Golden Dot&quot;. Shortly thereafter, Corso discovered he had irreversible prostate cancer. He died of the disease in Minnesota on January 17, 2001. Around two hundred people were present in the &quot;Non-Catholic Cemetery&quot; in Rome, Italy, on Saturday morning, May 5, to pay their last respects to Gregory Corso. In the tranquility of this small and lovely cemetery full of trees, flowers and well-fed cats, with the sun&#x27;s complicity, more than a funeral, it seemed to be a reunion of long-lost friends, with tales, anecdotes, laughter and poetry readings. The urn bearing Corso&#x27;s ashes arrived with his daughter Sheri Langerman who had assisted him during the last seven months of his life. Twelve other Americans came with her, among them Corso&#x27;s old friends Roger Richards and the lawyer Robert Yarra. The cemetery had been closed to newcomers since the mid-century and Robert Yarra and Hannelore deLellis made it possible for Corso to be buried there. His ashes were deposited at the foot of the grave of poet Percy Bysshe Shelley in the Cimitero Acattolico, and not far from John Keats. He wrote his own epitaph:

&lt;poem&gt;
Spir&#x27;t 
is Life
It flows thru
the death of me
endlessly
like a river
unafraid
of becoming
the sea&lt;/poem&gt;

== Posthumous ==
In 2017 the international quarterly &quot;Four by Two&quot; magazine, in collaboration with Raymond Foye, ran a series of previously unpublished poems by Corso, one of them handwritten and accompanied by small paintings, as well as two postcards of his watercolors portraying William Burroughs and Edgar Allan Poe.

== Quotes ==
*&quot;…a tough young kid from the Lower East Side who rose like an angel over the roof tops and sang Italian song as sweet as Caruso and Sinatra, but in words.… Amazing and beautiful, Gregory Corso, the one and only Gregory, the Herald.&quot;—Jack Kerouac – Introduction to &quot;Gasoline&quot;
*&quot;Corso&#x27;s a poet&#x27;s Poet, a poet much superior to me. Pure velvet... whose wild fame&#x27;s extended for decades around the world from France to China, World Poet.—Allen Ginsberg, &quot;On Corso&#x27;s Virtues&quot;
*&quot;Gregory&#x27;s voice echoes through a precarious future... His vitality and resilience always shine through, with a light that is more than human: the immortal light of his Muse... Gregory is indeed one of the Daddies.&quot;—William S. Burroughs
*&quot;The most important of the beat poets... a really true poet with an original voice&quot;—Nancy Peters, editor of &quot;City Lights&quot;
*&quot;Other than Mr. Corso, Gregory was all you ever needed to know. He defined the name by his every word or act. Always succinct, he never tried. Once he called you &#x27;My Ira&#x27; or &#x27;My Janine&#x27; or &#x27;My Allen,&#x27; he was forever &#x27;Your Gregory&#x27;.&quot;—Ira Cohen
*&quot;...It comes, I tell you, immense with gasolined rags and bits of wire and old bent nails, a dark arriviste, from a dark river within.&quot; – Gregory Corso, &quot;How Poetry Comes to Me&quot; (epigraph of &quot;Gasoline&quot;)
*&quot;They, that unnamed &quot;they&quot;, they&#x27;ve knocked me down but I got up. I always get up-and I swear when I went down quite often I took the fall; nothing moves a mountain but itself. They, I&#x27;ve long ago named them me.&quot; – Gregory Corso

<text>The Hot Chick is a 2002 American fantasy comedy film directed by Tom Brady, from a screenplay by Brady and Rob Schneider, and starring Schneider, Anna Faris, Matthew Lawrence, Eric Christian Olsen, and Rachel McAdams in her film debut. The film follows Jessica Spencer (McAdams), a mean-spirited cheerleader who switches bodies with incompetent criminal Clive Maxtone (Schneider). When Jessica discovers that the switch was caused by a pair of enchanted earrings she had stolen, one of which accidentally ended up in Clive&#x27;s possession, she enlists the help of her friends to get the earrings back together before the switch becomes permanent.

Adam Sandler served as executive producer and made an uncredited cameo as the Mambuza Bongo Player, a character based on one played by Schneider on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Principal photography began in March 2002 in Los Angeles and concluded in May.

&quot;The Hot Chick&quot; was theatrically released in the United States on December 13, 2002, and was a moderate box office success, grossing $54.6 million against its $34 million budget. Despite this, the film received negative reviews from critics, who criticized the jokes and Schneider&#x27;s performance.

==Plot==
In 50 BC, in an Abyssinian castle, Princess Nawa uses a pair of enchanted earrings to escape an arranged marriage by swapping bodies with a slave girl. When each woman wears one of the earrings, their bodies are magically swapped while their minds remain in place.

In her modern-day suburban home, Jessica Spencer is a beautiful but mean-spirited &quot;hot chick&quot;. Her closest friends are April, Keecia and Lulu. April is Jessica&#x27;s best friend, and all four girls are cheerleaders. At school one day, Jessica makes fun of an overweight girl named Hildenburg and a Wiccan girl named Eden. After that, she and her friends visit the local mall, where Jessica gets her rival Bianca into trouble and finds the earrings in an African-themed store. The earrings are not for sale, so Jessica steals them.

Shortly afterward, small-time criminal Clive Maxtone robs a nearby gas station. When Jessica and her friends stop and mistake him for an employee, he services their car to avoid raising suspicion. She accidentally drops one of the earrings on the ground, the girls drive away, and Clive picks up the earring. In their respective homes that evening, Jessica and Clive put on their earrings. When they wake up the next morning, each of them is trapped in the other&#x27;s body. This is especially difficult for Jessica, who has a cheering competition and the senior prom coming up soon.

After Jessica convinces her friends of who she is, they help her investigate the body swap. Hildenburg, Eden and Bianca are all innocent, Hildenburg and Eden join Jessica after she apologizes to them, and Eden finds a picture of the earrings on the internet. When the girls return to the African store, the owner explains how the earrings work and tells the girls they must find the other earring soon or the change will become permanent.

Meanwhile, Jessica is hired for two jobs while secretly living with April. At her own home, where she works as a gardener, her parents tell her about their marital problems and she helps them rekindle their sex life.

At school, while cleaning the boys&#x27; locker room as a custodian, she spies on her boyfriend Billy, who truly loves her, and April&#x27;s boyfriend Jake, who has been cheating on her. Faced with Jake&#x27;s infidelity, April begins to fall in love with Jessica, who agrees to take her to the prom.

At the cheering competition, Jessica signals romantically to Billy while disguised as the school mascot, but when the head of her suit falls off, he becomes confused and leaves with Bianca.

Jessica goes to the prom with April and they kiss. Jake sees this and is so upset, he spills his drink on his date. April confesses to being in love with Jessica, who tells April she is perfect and doesn&#x27;t need anybody. Jessica tries to win Billy back, telling Billy it&#x27;s her in Clive&#x27;s body, but he is so shocked and confused that he runs off.

During this time, Clive has been using Jessica&#x27;s body to make money from men, including Billy, who gives him his money and car, believing he is Jessica. Clive then tries to run him over. On the evening of the prom, Hildenburg sees a video of Clive in Jessica&#x27;s body robbing a man on the TV news, goes to the scene of the crime, and finds a business card for the club where Clive works as a pole dancer. She informs Jessica at the prom, and the girls go to the club.

When they find Clive, Jessica steals his earring and puts it on herself along with the other one. With both earrings now on the same person, Jessica&#x27;s and Clive&#x27;s bodies return to their original owners.

After Jessica makes up with Billy, the film ends with the school&#x27;s graduation ceremony, followed by a scene in which Clive, still running from the law and still dressed in lingerie and handcuffs, is picked up by a bartender who believes, based on earlier events, that he is gay. The bartender turns around slowly with a sinister smile on his face to look at Clive and locks his car&#x27;s doors. Clive screams in horror as the bartender drives away.

==Cast==
===Cameos===
Wes Takahashi, former animator and visual effects supervisor for Industrial Light &amp; Magic, makes a cameo appearance as a news reporter. Schneider&#x27;s mother Pilar and Brady&#x27;s wife Lisa both appear as judges of the cheerleading competition.

==Production==
Filming took place at El Segundo High School in El Segundo, Redondo Union High School in Redondo Beach, and University High School in Los Angeles. Speaking on the film, Rob Schneider commented: &quot;No man is a hundred-percent masculine and no woman is a hundred-percent feminine – we&#x27;re all just somewhere on the scale there. So what I tried to do was just play it with an innocence and gentleness, and then find some physical keys to lock-in on.&quot;

==Soundtrack==
==Release==
&quot;The Hot Chick&quot; was originally rated R, but several scenes were edited out to receive the broader PG-13 rating. The R version was classified 12A in Britain, maintaining the same rating given to the PG-13 theatrical version.

==Reception==

===Box office===
The film opened at #5 at the U.S. box office on the weekend of December 13–15, 2002, taking in US$7,401,146, averaging $3,338 across the 2,217 theatres where it was shown. It went on to earn a total worldwide gross of $54,639,553.

===Critical response===
&quot;The Hot Chick&quot; received negative reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film had an approval rating of 21% based on reviews from 82 critics, with an average score of 3.90/10. The critical consensus read: &quot;&quot;The Hot Chick&quot;″s one-note concept gets stretched thin, and a lot of the jokes fall flat.&quot; On Metacritic, as of October 2020, the film had a score of 29 out 100 based on reviews from 22 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B+ on scale of A to F.

Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper gave the film two thumbs way down. Ebert gave the film half a star (out of a possible four), declaring, &quot;The MPAA rates this PG-13. It is too vulgar for anyone under 13 and too dumb for anyone over 13.&quot; Roeper panned the film saying &quot;it&#x27;s in color. And, it was mostly in focus.&quot;

Dennis Harvey of &quot;Variety&quot; magazine wrote: &quot;At best routinely assembled—at worst barely competent. The slapstick is labored, and the bigger setpieces flat.&quot;

=== Accolades ===
Rob Schneider was nominated for a Razzie Award for Worst Actor of the Decade for his performance in the film.

==Home media ==
&quot;The Hot Chick&quot; was released on VHS and DVD on May 13, 2003 by Buena Vista Home Entertainment (under the Touchstone Home Entertainment label). The DVD featured the deleted scenes that would have given the film an R rating, including an alternate ending.

<text>The &quot;Indiana&quot; class was a class of three pre-dreadnought battleships launched in 1893. These were the first battleships built by the United States Navy comparable to contemporary European ships, such as the British . Authorized in 1890 and commissioned between November 1895 and April 1896, these were relatively small battleships with heavy armor and ordnance that pioneered the use of an intermediate battery. Specifically intended for coastal defense, their freeboard was insufficient to deal well with the waves of the open ocean. The turrets lacked counterweights, and the main belt armor was placed too low to be effective under most conditions.

The ships were named , , and and were designated &quot;Battleship Number 1&quot; through &quot;3&quot;. All three served in the Spanish–American War, although &quot;Oregon&quot;—which was stationed on the West Coast—had to cruise around South America to the East Coast first. After the war, &quot;Oregon&quot; returned to the Pacific and participated in the Philippine–American War and Boxer Rebellion, while her sister ships were restricted to training missions in the Atlantic Ocean. After 1903, the obsolete battleships were decommissioned and recommissioned several times, the last time during World War I when &quot;Indiana&quot; and &quot;Massachusetts&quot; served as training ships, while &quot;Oregon&quot; was a transport escort for the Siberian Intervention.

In 1919, all three ships were decommissioned for the final time. &quot;Indiana&quot; was sunk in shallow water as an explosives test target a year later and sold for scrap in 1924. &quot;Massachusetts&quot; was scuttled off the coast of Pensacola in 1920 and used as an artillery target. The wreck was never scrapped and is now a Florida Underwater Archaeological Preserve. &quot;Oregon&quot; was initially preserved as a museum, but was sold for scrap during World War II. The scrapping was later halted and the stripped hulk was used as an ammunition barge during the battle of Guam. The hulk was finally sold for scrap in 1956.

== Background ==
The &quot;Indiana&quot; class was very controversial at the time of its approval by the United States Congress. A policy board convened by the Secretary of the Navy Benjamin F. Tracy came up with an ambitious 15-year naval construction program on 16 July 1889, three years after the and the were authorized. The battleships in their plan would include ten first-rate long-range battleships with a top speed and a steaming radius of at — maximum. These ocean-going ships were envisioned as a possible fleet in being, a fleet capable of raiding an enemy&#x27;s home ports and intended to deter powerful warships from ranging too far from home. Twenty-five short-range second-rate battleships would provide home defense in both the Atlantic and Pacific and support the faster and larger long-range vessels. With a range of roughly at 10 knots and a draft of , they would roam from the St. Lawrence River in the north to the Windward Islands and Panama in the south and would be able to enter all the ports in the southern United States.

It was proposed, probably for cost reasons, that the short-range battleships should have a hierarchy of three subclasses. The first would mount four guns each on eight ships, the second would mount four guns each on ten ships, and the third would mount two 12-inch and two guns each on five ships. The two battleships already under construction, &quot;Texas&quot; and &quot;Maine&quot;, were to be grouped under the last class. In addition, 167 smaller ships, including rams, cruisers and torpedo boats, would be built, coming to a total cost of $281.55 million, approximately equal to the sum of the entire US Navy budget during the previous 15 years (adjusted for inflation, $6.6 billion in 2009 dollars).

Congress balked at the plan, seeing in it an end to the United States policy of isolationism and the beginning of imperialism. Even some supporters of naval expansion were wary; Senator Eugene Hale feared that because the proposal was so large, the entire bill would be shot down and no money appropriated for any ships. However, in April 1890, the United States House of Representatives approved funding for three 8,000-long ton battleships. Tracy, trying to soothe tensions within Congress, remarked that these ships were so powerful only twelve would be necessary instead of the 35 called for in the original plan. He also slashed the operating costs of the Navy by giving the remaining Civil War-era monitors—which were utterly obsolete by this time—to navy militias operated by the states. The appropriation was also approved by the Senate, and in total three coast-defense battleships (the &quot;Indiana&quot; class), a cruiser, and a torpedo boat were given official approval and funding on 30 June 1890.

The first class of short-range ships as envisioned by the policy board were to mount 13-inch/35 caliber and new guns, with of belt armor, of deck armor and of armor over the casemates. The &quot;Indiana&quot; class, as actually built, exceeded the design in displacement by 25 percent, but most other aspects were relatively similar to the original plan. An belt and a secondary battery of and guns were adopted, the latter because the Bureau of Ordnance did not have the capability to construct rapid-firing 5-inch weaponry. The larger weapons were much slower firing and much heavier, but without the bigger guns, the ships would not be able to penetrate the armor of foreign battleships.

== Design ==

=== General characteristics ===

The &quot;Indiana&quot;-class ships were designed specifically for coastal defense and were not intended for offensive actions. This design view was reflected in their moderate coal endurance, relatively small displacement and low freeboard, which limited seagoing capability. However, they were heavily armed and armored, so much in fact that &quot;Conway&#x27;s All the World&#x27;s Fighting Ships&quot; describes them as &quot;attempting too much on a very limited displacement.&quot; They resembled the British battleship , but were shorter and featured an intermediate battery consisting of eight 8-inch guns not found in European ships, giving them a very respectable amount of firepower for their time.

The original design of the &quot;Indiana&quot; class included bilge keels, but with keels they would not fit in any of the American drydocks at the time, so they were omitted during construction. This meant a reduction in stability and caused a serious problem for &quot;Indiana&quot;, when both main turrets broke loose from their clamps in heavy seas a year after being commissioned. Because the turrets were not centrally balanced, they swung from side to side with the motion of the ship, until they were secured with heavy ropes. When the ship encountered more bad weather four months later, she promptly steamed back to port for fear the clamps would break again. This convinced the navy that bilge keels were necessary and they were subsequently installed on all three ships.

=== Armament ===
Given their limited displacement, the &quot;Indiana&quot; class had formidable armament for the time: four 13-inch guns, an intermediate battery of eight 8-inch guns and a secondary battery of four 6-inch guns, twenty Hotchkiss 6-pounders, and six Maxim-Nordenfelt 1-pounders, as well as six 18 inch (450 mm) tubes.

The 13-inch gun was 35 calibers long and used black powder, giving a range of about at 15 degrees of elevation. At , a shell was expected to penetrate of side armor. The four guns were mounted in two centerline turrets, located fore and aft. The turrets were originally designed to feature sloping side armor, but space requirements made this impossible without using significantly larger gun turrets or redesigning the gun mounts (which was later done for the s). The ships&#x27; low freeboard greatly hindered the use of the main battery in rough weather conditions, because the deck would become awash. Also, because the ship lacked a counterweight to offset the weight of the gun barrels, the ship would list in the direction the guns were aimed. This reduced the maximum arc of elevation (and thus range) to about five degrees, brought the main armor belt under water on that side, and exposed the unarmored bottom on the other. It was considered in 1901 to replace the turrets with new balanced models used in later ships, but that was decided to be too costly as the ships were already obsolete. Instead, counterweights were added, which partially solved the problem. The hydraulic rammers and turning mechanisms of the 8-inch turrets were also replaced by faster and more efficient electric equivalents, new sights were fitted on &quot;Indiana&quot; and &quot;Massachusetts&quot;, and new turret hoists were installed to improve the reloading speed, but the gun mountings never performed in an entirely satisfactory manner.

The eight 8-inch guns were mounted in pairs in four wing turrets placed on the superstructure. Their arc of fire, although big on paper, was in reality limited. Adjacent gun positions and superstructure would be damaged by their muzzle blast if the gun was trained alongside it, a defect also suffered by the 13-inch guns. The smaller 6-inch guns were mounted in twin wing casemates midships on the main deck level, with a 6-pounder in between. The other Hotchkiss 6-pounders lined the superstructure and bridge decks. Four of the 1-pounders were placed in hull casemates at the bow and stern of the ship and two more in the fighting tops of the masts. In 1908, all the 6-inch and most of the lighter guns were removed to compensate for the counterweights added to the main battery and because ammunition supply for the guns was considered problematic. A year later, twelve /50-caliber single-purpose guns were added midships and in the fighting tops.

Sources conflict on the number of torpedo tubes originally included in the ships, but it is clear they were located on the berth deck and had above-water ports located on the extreme front and aft and midships. Located too close to the waterline to allow use while moving and vulnerable to gunfire when opened, they were considered useless and were quickly reduced in number, and removed entirely before 1908.
In 1918 there was a proposal to modify the three &quot;Indiana&quot;-class ships to carry a single 98-caliber gun built by lining down a 50-caliber gun to that size. Preliminary design of the turret for the gun was completed in October for service in mid-1919, but the end of the war the following month caused the program to be converted into a test program for long-range guns. The Bureau of Ordnance decided to first test a gun lined down to 3 inches as a proof of concept, but those tests did not commence until 1922.

=== Protection ===
With the exception of the deck armor, 8-inch turrets and conning tower—which consisted of conventional nickel steel—the &quot;Indiana&quot; class was protected with the new Harvey armor. Its main protection was a belt thick, placed along two-thirds of the length of the hull from above to under the waterline. Beyond this point, the belt gradually grew thinner until it ended under the waterline, where the belt was only thick. Below the belt the ship had no armor, only a double bottom. On both ends the belt was connected to the barbettes of the main guns with armored bulkheads. In the waterline sections outside this central citadel, compartments were filled with compressed cellulose, intended to self-seal when damaged. Between the deck and the main belt, 5-inch hull armor was used. The deck armor was thick inside the citadel and outside it. The hollow conning tower was a single forging 10 inches thick. The 13-inch gun battery had of vertical turret plating and barbettes, while the 8-inch cannons had only 6inches of vertical turret plating and barbettes. The casemates protecting the 6-inch guns were 5inches thick and the other casemates, lighter guns, shell hoists and turret crowns were all lightly armored.

The placement of the belt armor was based on the draft from the design, which was with a normal load of of coal on board. Her total coal storage capacity was , and fully loaded her draft would increase to , entirely submerging the armor belt. During actual service, especially at war, the ships were kept fully loaded whenever possible, rendering her belt armor almost useless. That this was not considered in the design outraged the Walker policy board–convened in 1896 to evaluate the existing American battleships and propose a design for the new s–and they set a standard that the load of coal and ammunition that future ships were designed for had to be at least two-thirds of the maximum, so similar problems would be prevented in new ships.

=== Propulsion ===
Two vertical inverted triple expansion reciprocating steam engines powered by four double-ended Scotch boilers drove twin propellers, while two single-ended Scotch boilers supplied steam for auxiliary machinery. The engines were designed to provide , giving the ships a top speed of . During sea trials, which were conducted with limited amounts of coal, ammunition and supplies on board, it was found that the indicated horsepower and top speed exceeded design values and a significant variation between the three ships existed. The engines of &quot;Indiana&quot; delivered , giving a top speed of . &quot;Massachusetts&quot; had a top speed of with and &quot;Oregon&quot; reached a speed of with . Eight Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers, including four with superheaters, were installed on &quot;Indiana&quot; in 1904 and the same number on &quot;Massachusetts&quot; in 1907 to replace the outdated Scotch boilers.

=== &quot;Indiana&quot; (BB-1) ===

Commissioned in 1895, &quot;Indiana&quot; did not participate in any notable events until the outbreak of the Spanish–American War in 1898, when &quot;Indiana&quot; was part of the North Atlantic Squadron under Rear Admiral William T. Sampson. His squadron was ordered to the Spanish port of San Juan in an attempt to intercept and destroy Admiral Cevera&#x27;s Spanish squadron, which was en route to the Caribbean from Spain. The harbor was empty, but &quot;Indiana&quot; and the rest of the squadron bombarded it for two hours before realizing their mistake. Three weeks later news arrived that Commodore Schley&#x27;s Flying Squadron had found Cervera and was now blockading him in the port of Santiago de Cuba. Sampson reinforced Schley two days later and assumed overall command. Cervera saw that his situation was desperate and attempted to run the blockade on 3July 1898. &quot;Indiana&quot; did not join in the chase of the fast Spanish cruisers because of her extreme eastern position on the blockade and low speed caused by engine problems, but was near the harbor entrance when the Spanish destroyers &quot;Pluton&quot; and &quot;Furor&quot; emerged. Together with the battleship and armed yacht she opened fire, destroying the lightly armored enemy ships.

After the war, &quot;Indiana&quot; returned to training exercises before being decommissioned in 1903. The battleship was recommissioned in January 1906 to function as a training vessel until she was decommissioned again in 1914. Her third commission was in 1917 when &quot;Indiana&quot; served as a training ship for gun crews during World War I. She was decommissioned for the final time on 31 January 1919, shortly after being reclassified &quot;Coast Battleship Number 1&quot; so that the name &quot;Indiana&quot; could be assigned to the newly authorized—but never completed—battleship . She was sunk in shallow water as a target in underwater explosion and aerial bombing tests in November 1920. Her hulk was sold for scrap on 19 March 1924.

=== &quot;Massachusetts&quot; (BB-2) ===

Between being commissioned in 1896 and the outbreak of the Spanish–American War in 1898, &quot;Massachusetts&quot; conducted training exercises off the eastern coast of the United States. During the war, she was placed in the Flying Squadron under Commodore Winfield Scott Schley. Schley went searching for Cervera&#x27;s Spanish squadron and found it in the port of Santiago. The battleship was part of the blockade fleet until 3July, but missed the Battle of Santiago de Cuba, because she had steamed to Guantánamo Bay the night before to resupply coal. The next day, the battleship came back to Santiago, where she and &quot;Texas&quot; fired at the Spanish cruiser &quot;Reina Mercedes&quot;, which was being scuttled by the Spanish in a failed attempt to block the harbor entrance channel.

During the next seven years, &quot;Massachusetts&quot; cruised the Atlantic coast and eastern Caribbean as a member of the North Atlantic Squadron and then served for a year as a training ship for Naval Academy midshipmen until she was decommissioned in January 1906. In May 1910, she was placed in reduced commission as a training ship again before entering the Atlantic Reserve Fleet in September 1912, where she stayed until being decommissioned in May 1914. &quot;Massachusetts&quot; was recommissioned in June 1917 to serve as a training ship for gun crews during World War I. She was decommissioned for the final time on 31 March 1919, after being redesignated &quot;Coast Battleship Number 2&quot; two days earlier so her name could be reused for . On 6January 1921 she was scuttled off the coast of Pensacola and used as an artillery target for Fort Pickens. The Navy attempted to sell her for scrap, but no buyer could be found and in 1956 the ship was declared the property of the state of Florida. The wreck is currently one of the Florida Underwater Archaeological Preserves and serves as an artificial reef.

=== &quot;Oregon&quot; (BB-3) ===
&quot;Oregon&quot; served for a short time with the Pacific Station before being ordered on a voyage around South America to the East Coast in March 1898 in preparation for war with Spain. She departed from San Francisco on 19 March, and reached Jupiter Inlet on 24 May, stopping several times for additional coal on the way. A journey of over 14,000 nautical miles was completed in 66 days, which was considered a remarkable achievement at the time. The &quot;Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships&quot; describes the effect of the journey on the American public and government as follows: &quot;On one hand the feat had demonstrated the many capabilities of a heavy battleship in all conditions of wind and sea. On the other it swept away all opposition for the construction of the Panama Canal, for it was then made clear that the country could not afford to take two months to send warships from one coast to the other each time an emergency arose.&quot; After completing her journey, &quot;Oregon&quot; was ordered to join the blockade at Santiago as part of the North Atlantic Squadron under Rear Admiral Sampson. She took part in the Battle of Santiago de Cuba, where she and the cruiser were the only ships fast enough to chase down the Spanish cruiser &quot;Cristobal Colon&quot;, forcing its surrender. Around this time, she received the nickname &quot;Bulldog of the Navy&quot;, most likely because of her high bow wave—known as &quot;having a bone in her teeth&quot; in nautical slang—and perseverance during the cruise around South America and the battle of Santiago.

After the war, &quot;Oregon&quot; was refitted in New York City before she was sent back to the Pacific, where she served as a guard ship for two years. She served for a year in the Philippines during the Philippine–American War and then spent a year in China at Wusong during the Boxer Rebellion until May 1901, when she was ordered back to the United States for an overhaul. In March 1903, &quot;Oregon&quot; returned to Asiatic waters and the ship remained in the Far East, returning only shortly before decommissioning in April 1906. &quot;Oregon&quot; was recommissioned in August 1911, but saw little activity and was officially placed on reserve status in 1914. On 2 January 1915, the ship was returned to full commission and sailed to San Francisco for the Panama–Pacific International Exposition. A year later, she was back to reserve status, only to be returned to full commission in April 1917 when the United States joined World War I. &quot;Oregon&quot; acted as one of the escorts for transport ships during the Siberian Intervention. In June 1919, she was decommissioned, but a month later she was temporarily recommissioned as the reviewing ship for President Woodrow Wilson during the arrival of the Pacific Fleet at Seattle. In October 1919, she was decommissioned for the final time. As a result of the Washington Naval Treaty, &quot;Oregon&quot; was declared &quot;incapable of further warlike service&quot; in January 1924. In June 1925, she was loaned to the State of Oregon, who used her as a floating monument and museum in Portland.

In February 1941, &quot;Oregon&quot; was redesignated . Due to the outbreak of World War II, it was decided that the scrap value of the ship was more important than her historical value, so she was sold. Her stripped hulk was later returned to the Navy and used as an ammunition barge during the battle of Guam, where she remained for several years. During a typhoon in November 1948, she broke loose and drifted out to sea. She was located southeast of Guam and towed back. She was sold on 15 March 1956 and scrapped in Japan.

<doc id="227295" wikidata="Q1511216" url="?curid=227295" title="Courtier">
<text>A courtier () is a person who attends the royal court of a monarch or other royalty. The earliest historical examples of courtiers were part of the retinues of rulers. Historically the court was the centre of government as well as the official residence of the monarch, and the social and political life were often completely mixed together.

==Background==
Monarchs very often expected the more important nobles to spend much of the year in attendance on them at court. Not all courtiers were noble, as they included clergy, soldiers, clerks, secretaries, agents and middlemen with business at court. All those who held a court appointment could be called courtiers but not all courtiers held positions at court. Those personal favourites without business around the monarch, sometimes called the camarilla, were also considered courtiers. As social divisions became more rigid, a divide, barely present in Antiquity or the Middle Ages, opened between menial servants and other classes at court, although Alexandre Bontemps, the head valet de chambre of Louis XIV, was a late example of a &quot;menial&quot; who managed to establish his family in the nobility. The key commodities for a courtier were access and information, and a large court operated at many levels: many successful careers at court involved no direct contact with the monarch.

The largest and most famous European court was that of the Palace of Versailles at its peak, although the Forbidden City of Beijing was even larger and more isolated from national life. Very similar features marked the courts of all very large monarchies, including in India, Topkapı Palace in Istanbul, Ancient Rome, Byzantium or the Caliphs of Baghdad or Cairo. Early medieval European courts frequently travelled from place to place following the monarch as they travelled. This was particularly the case in the early French court. But, the European nobility generally had independent power and was less controlled by the monarch until around the 18th century, which gave European court life greater complexity.

The earliest courtiers coincide with the development of definable courts beyond the rudimentary entourages or retinues of rulers. There were probably courtiers in the courts of the Akkadian Empire where there is evidence of court appointments such as that of cup-bearer which was one of the earliest court appointments and remained a position at courts for thousands of years. Two of the earliest titles referring to the general concept of a courtier were likely the &quot;ša rēsi&quot; and &quot;mazzāz pāni&quot; of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. In Ancient Egypt a title has been found that translates to high steward or great overseer of the house.

The courts influenced by the court of the Neo-Assyrian Empire such as those of the Median Empire and the Achaemenid Empire had numerous courtiers After invading the Achaemenid Empire, Alexander the Great returned with the concept of the complex court featuring a variety of courtiers to the Kingdom of Macedonia and Hellenistic Greece.

The imperial court of the Byzantine Empire at Constantinople would eventually contain at least a thousand courtiers. The court&#x27;s systems became prevalent in other courts such as those in the Balkan states, the Ottoman Empire and Russia. Byzantinism is a term that was coined for this spread of the Byzantine system in the 19th century.

==Examples==

* Bagoas
* Anne Boleyn
* Alessandro Cagliostro

==In literature==
In modern literature, courtiers are often depicted as insincere, skilled at flattery and intrigue, ambitious and lacking regard for the national interest. More positive representations include the role played by members of the court in the development of politeness and the arts.

Examples of courtiers in fiction:
* Rosencrantz and Guildenstern from William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;.
* Sir Lancelot from Arthurian legend,
* Gríma Wormtongue from J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.
* Count Hasimir Fenring and Gaius Helen Mohiam from Frank Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot;.
* Petyr Baelish and Varys from George R. R. Martin&#x27;s &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot;.

<doc id="227302" wikidata="Q7918305" url="?curid=227302" title="Vegas Dream">
<text>Vegas Dream, released in Japan as is a gambling video game developed by HAL Laboratory for the Nintendo Entertainment System. A sequel, &quot;Vegas Stakes&quot;, was released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1993.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Vegas Dream&quot; begins with graphics showing one of the players arriving at Las Vegas by airplane. Featuring a backdrop of old downtown Las Vegas, players choose which of the two game modes to play: &quot;Vegas Dream&quot; (storyline version) or &quot;One Spot&quot; (strictly gaming, no storyline).

Players then start with a bankroll of $700 at the fictional HAL Palace Hotel (or the Epic Palace in the Japanese version), to spend on four games: Keno, Blackjack, Roulette or Slot machines. Between rounds of play at the normal casino games, there are randomly occurring social interactions with various characters, such as business people, other patrons, or casino employees (in the &quot;Vegas Dream&quot; version of the game only). These interactions (and the player&#x27;s responses to them) have different possible results: sometimes the unidentified man is a pickpocket; other times he is just down on his luck and will reward the player&#x27;s kindness down the road. The results of interactions are reported on a local Las Vegas news station; music with a cheery tone plays for positive happenings, such as the player receiving cash, with more somber music playing for thefts, injuries, etc.

&quot;Vegas Dream&quot; also allows the player to date and marry as many members of the opposite sex as desired; men marry a woman named Ms. Sophie while women marry a man named Mr. James. Marriage results in increased cash flow for the player, or a loss of funds from theft in the event that the married person is crooked.

There is a password save feature built into the game. The passwords are twenty-six characters long and consist of letters, numbers and symbols. The Japanese version, with gameplay identical to the North American version, uses slightly stronger language in its script and mentions cigarettes. The text within the Japanese version is also entirely in English.

===Endings===
It is possible to win the game by earning over $10 million, at which point the player is seen reclining by a pool with their household staff (assuming the player has moved into a mansion and has hired servants), and then taking a limousine to a show with their partner.

Should the player lose all their money, the staff at the HAL Palace give the player one final pull on a slot machine in a last-ditch effort to win some more money. If the player wins, they get to resume their gaming; if not, the player is bid goodbye, and a screen appears showing persons heading towards a plane, ready to depart Las Vegas, ending the game.

==Music==
At this time, Kazuo Sawa was writing music to some of Hal Laboratory&#x27;s video games such as &quot;Tokoro-san no Mamoru mo Semeru mo&quot;. Instead, Hal hired professional keyboardist Kuni Kawachi to compose the game&#x27;s soundtrack while Sawa worked on sound design and provided the sound driver. &quot;Vegas Dream&quot; is Kuni Kawachi&#x27;s only video game to date.

<doc id="227308" wikidata="Q769269" url="?curid=227308" title="Upper Peru">
<text>Upper Peru (; ) is a name for the land that was governed by the Real Audiencia of Charcas. The name originated in Buenos Aires towards the end of the 18th century after the Audiencia of Charcas was transferred from the Viceroyalty of Peru to the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata in 1776. It comprised the governorships of Potosí, La Paz, Cochabamba, Chiquitos, Moxos and Charcas (since renamed Sucre).

Following the Bolivian War of Independence, the region became an independent country and was renamed Bolivia in honor of Simón Bolívar.

== History ==

By 1821, the Spanish colonial empire in Latin America was falling apart because of the Napoleonic occupation of Spain, and the troops of generals Bolívar and Sucre, who had already liberated Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador, were already approaching the Upper Peru region.

Fearing bloodshed that the libertarian troops could cause the local population, in June 1822 the three governors of Upper Peru departments gathered in Cuiabá (Captaincy of Mato Grosso, Brazil) and asked the governor to take sides with the Prince Regent (future Emperor Pedro I) to occupy the territory for the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. It was better (thought the governors) to be occupied by a monarchical state than to entertain the idea of rule by a fragile and uncertain republic.

Immediately, in July of that year, the governor of Mato Grosso sent to Upper Peru the troops stationed in the captaincy and closed the borders to stop the advance of the libertarian troops. He sent to the Prince the proposal of the local authorities and the dispatch order of the troops.

The letter reached Emperor Pedro I only in November 1822, when Brazil had already declared independence and, worse, Brazil was not interested in attaching that territory, because the new country was more concerned with pacifying the northern and northeastern provinces. Thus, the order given by the Emperor was to call back the troops (leaving the way clear for the libertarians to occupy these territories) claiming that &quot;Brazil does not interfere in foreign affairs.&quot;

This episode is poorly documented, the curious thing is that the Generals Antonio Jose de Sucre and Simón Bolívar, knowing what was happening, managed to send diplomats in record time to Rio de Janeiro and these diplomats arrived even faster than the letter from the governor of Mato Grosso, so the result was that when he got the letter, the Emperor was already &quot;head made&quot; and the evacuation order was already given.

== Spanish conquest of Charcas ==
Initially, the province of Charcas was under the administration of the Viceroyalty of Peru until 1776 when the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata was established.

== As a Río de la Plata province ==
The Assembly of Buenos Aires advanced to the province of Charcas as part of the Viceroyalty of Río de la Plata and had elected representatives of the Provinces of Upper Peru for the Congress of the United Provinces of Río de la Plata.

== Counterrevolution ==
When the Viceroyalty of Río de la Plata gained independence, the Viceroy Abascal incorporated Upper Peru to the Viceroyalty of Peru including the province of Charcas.

== Brazilian Intervention ==
The occupation occurred in the region Upper Peru (now Bolivia) between July and December 1822, which mobilized the Portuguese royal troops stationed in the Captaincy of Mato Grosso and occupied three of the Peru departments: La Paz, Santa Cruz de la Sierra and the so-called Department Maritmo (Atacama) .

== Colombian Occupation ==
Between 1823 and 1828 Colombian troops occupied Upper Peru with the leadership of Marshal Antonio José de Sucre, born in Cumaná, as the continuation of the Campaigns of the South. The Republic of Bolívar (based on the Upper Peru) was considered to be a satellite state of Gran Colombia.

== Claims by Argentina and Peru ==
Argentina and Peru claimed some territories of Upper Peru for historical reasons.

<doc id="227311" wikidata="Q682229" url="?curid=227311" title="The Dark Eye (role-playing game)">
<text>The Dark Eye () is a German tabletop role-playing game with a high fantasy theme created by Ulrich Kiesow and launched by Schmidt Spiel &amp; Freizeit GmbH and Droemer Knaur Verlag in 1984. It is the most successful role-playing game on the German market, outselling &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. Many years of work on the game have led to a detailed and extensively described game world.

Droemer Knaur dropped the project in early 1989; after the bankruptcy of the Schmidt Spiel &amp; Freizeit GmbH in 1997, publishing was continued by Fantasy Productions (which had already done all the editorial work). Since the game&#x27;s launch, it has gone through five editions, making the rules and background more complex. The basic rules of the fourth edition of &quot;The Dark Eye&quot; were published in 2001, and it became the first edition to be released in English in October 2003. The fifth edition of the game was released in August 2015, with an English translation released in November 2016.

Aventuria, the continent on which the game is set, was first introduced to the English-language market through a series of computer games and novels and later under the name &quot;Realms of Arkania&quot;. The trademark &quot;Realms of Arkania&quot; was owned by the now-defunct Sir-tech Software, Inc., which spurred the name change to &quot;The Dark Eye&quot;; Fantasy Productions was unable to obtain the trademark. In April 2007, Ulisses Spiele assumed the TDE pen-and-paper licence from Fantasy Productions.

== Game history ==
=== First edition (1984) ===

The first German edition, released in 1984, was translated into Dutch (&#x27;), French (&#x27;) and Italian (&#x27;), but not into English. It has a very simple class and level system. It was published in &#x27; (&quot;The Dark Eye—Adventure Base Game&quot;). Advanced rules were published in 1985 in the book &quot;&quot; (&quot;Extended adventure—Additional equipment for all adventures&quot;).

==== Character ====
The character (called &quot;Hero&quot; in the rules) is defined by five qualities (or attributes): &#x27; (courage), &#x27; (wisdom), &#x27; (charisma), &#x27; (agility) and &quot;&quot; (strength). They are determined by 1d6+7 in dice notation (8–13). The weight the character can carry is equal to strength × 100 ounces (1 aventurian ounce is 25 g).

The player can choose five different character types (or classes): adventurer, warrior, dwarf, elf and mage. All characters can be adventurers, but there are attribute conditions that must be met before accessing the other types (for example, a warrior must have at least 12 in both courage and strength).

During the adventures, the character gains adventure points; with a sufficient number of adventure points, they can go to the next level. When attaining a new level the character can increase an attribute by one point, and either the attack or parry value by one point; they also win vitality points equal to one dice roll, or vitality or astral energy points equal to one dice roll for elves and mages. The extended rules add a sixth quality to the hero&#x27;s definition: stamina. The initial stamina is the sum of the force and vitality points. Stamina represents resistance to exhaustion; it decreases when the hero makes physical efforts such as running, swimming and fighting.

The extended rules also provide four more classes that can be chosen during the creation of the character, or sometimes as an evolution of an adventurer or dwarf: rider, druid, priest or wood elf. It introduces the aptitudes (skills) that are chances to manage definite actions (such as horseback riding or camouflage), whereas the qualities are generic indicators. The aptitudes range between 0 and 18 (and are tested with a d20 in dice notation). They have a base value (some are part of the culture, or are simple tasks). When the character reaches a new level, the player can distribute 10 points to raise the aptitudes. The base value and the cost to increase depend on the type of hero (riding is easier for a warrior than for a mage); the cost also depends on the current aptitude level.

==== Health ====
The character type determines the starting value of vitality points (from 20 for a mage to 35 for a dwarf). This is to be compared with the 1d6+4 (dice notation) damage points inflicted by a sword.

In the extended rules, stamina plays a role in the healing of diseases (such as a fever); when it is 20 or more spontaneous healing is possible, and it is faster when stamina is above 25.

==== Resolution of actions ====
Actions are resolved by testing the attributes; the action succeeds when:
:1d20 ≤ attribute + modifier
The modifier is positive when the action is difficult, and negative when it is easy. The extended rules introduce the aptitudes, which are tested in the same way as the qualities.

==== Combat ====
In fights, the characters act in decreasing order of initiative (the character with the highest initiative acts first). Characters have attack and parry values determined by various other values. Typical attack/parry values for a new character are in the range of 14/12 (for fighters) to something like 6/8 (dedicated non-fighters, such as priests of the goddess Tsa). When the attack test of the attacker is successful and the defender misses the parry test, the defender loses the number of vitality points equal to the damage of the weapon minus the protection rating of the armor (chain mail has a protection rating of four, and knight armour has six). When the attacker rolls one or two on the die, they make a master hit; the maximum damage is inflicted, and the armour does not protect.

The extended rules provide for miniature figures which allow a finer representation of movement, with (for example) the possibility to push back an enemy. They also offer various possibilities such as fleeing, charging and successive attacks from the same fighter (assault).
They replace the master hit with the notions of good attack (the attacker makes a throw equal to or less than the good attack score, as shown on a table in relation to her attack score) and good parry (five points less than the parry score with the d20 in dice notation). A good attack not parried by a good parry implies a serious (or critical) impact (throw 1d20 and read the result on a table). When the attack or parry-test die shows 20, this can lead to a fumble. The extended rules also allow dodging thrown weapons, introduce specific rules for empty-hand and horseback fighting and infection (fever) for wounds.

==== Magic ====
Elves, druids, shamans, witches and mages can cast spells and have astral energy points; the starting value of astral energy points depends on the attribute values the hero has when created. When a spell is cast, the character loses the astral energy points corresponding to the spell.

The extended rules introduce new spells. From the fifth level on, it is no longer necessary to speak the words to cast the spell. These rules also describe spells for the druids and wood elves, and priests&#x27; miracles: manifestations of the priest&#x27;s god, which are similar to magic spells. The priests do not have astral energy but karma, which works the same way.

=== First-edition advanced rules (&quot;The Sword Masters&quot;, 1988) ===
Two sets, &#x27; (&quot;TDE Professional—Sword Masters Set I&quot;) and &#x27; (&quot;TDE Professional II—The Sword Masters&#x27; Feast&quot;), were published in 1988 and 1989. This edition was published as advanced rules for the first edition, but is sometimes erroneously considered the second edition. Combat rules are much more elaborate, introducing a hit-location system.

It was written for advanced-level characters (typically level 15). The sets describe a new world: Tharun (pronounced &quot;taroon&quot;), a hollow world. It is the inside of Ethra, lightened by a central sun. Nine archipelagos constitute the realm of this world. A pantheon of nine deities rules over the inhabitants. Divine runes (one of the only sources of magic which can be used by magicians and druids) are scattered all over the world. The sets also provide a divine quest. A third set of campaigns was planned, but has not been released. The Tharun setting was abandoned, but it is said that the world and its pantheon still exist; some deities are worshiped in Myranor.

=== Second edition (1988) ===
The second edition was published in 1988. The character is defined by the same five positive attributes (qualities) as in the first edition, as well as five new negative ones: &#x27; (superstition), &#x27; (acrophobia), &#x27; (claustrophobia), &#x27; (avarice) and &quot;&quot; (necrophobia). The positive attributes are determined by 1d6+7 in dice notation (8–13), and the negative by 1d6+1 (2–7). The player can choose from over 40 different character types (classes). Again, there are attributes (conditions) to access the types. A character also features over 80 skills, called &quot;talents&quot;; the use of a talent requires testing three attributes, and the character is able to cast over 100 (11×11) spells.

=== Third edition and &quot;Realms of Arkania&quot; (1993) ===
The third edition (1993) was used (with a few limitations) to power the three &quot;Realms of Arkania&quot; computer games: &quot;RoA: Blade of Destiny&quot; (1993), Attic/Sir-Tech), &quot;RoA: Star Trail&quot; (1994, Attic/Sir-Tech) and &quot;RoA: Shadows over Riva&quot; (1997, Attic/Sir-Tech). &quot;Realms of Arkania&quot; was also the name of three translated novels: &quot;RoA: The Charlatan&quot; (January 1996, ), &quot;RoA: The Lioness&quot; (March 1996, ) and &quot;RoA: The Sacrifice&quot; (September 1996, ).

The rules are similar to the second edition except for two additional positive attributes: &#x27; (dexterity) and &#x27; (intuition); and two additional negative attributes: &#x27; (curiosity) and &#x27; (violent temper). The character is thus defined by seven positive and seven negative attributes (qualities), and this edition uses the same system of talents.

=== Fourth edition (2001) ===
The fourth edition of &quot;The Dark Eye&quot; supports a great variety of character choices. Where the older editions forced the player to create a character along very strict lines, the fourth edition is flexible and the player can choose from hundreds of different character classes and cultural backgrounds. The creation rules are somewhat similar to those of &quot;Shadowrun&quot; (also published by Fantasy Productions) and even more to &quot;GURPS&quot;. One reason for this development is the large community of professional authors and enthusiastic players, which have helped to define the continent of Aventuria over the last 20 years. Character generation is based on &quot;generation points&quot; from which a race, a culture and a profession must be &quot;paid&quot;. The points are also used for attributes and other skills. After generation, the gained &quot;adventure points&quot; for each adventure can be used for equipping the character with skills. Consequently, the systems intends to balance power levels of different character classes.

The fourth edition was also translated into English. Three books are available in English (all published 2006): 
*&quot;Basic Rules&quot; ()
*&quot;Secret of the Blue Tower / Witching Hour&quot; ()
*&quot;World of Aventuria&quot; ()

=== Fifth edition (2015) ===

Ulisses started development of the fifth edition in the beginning of 2014. Its development involved a players poll and parts of the publishers internet forum are dedicated to that topic. The beta version (in German) was released 10 May 2014 and can be freely downloaded. The final German version is available as of 31 July 2015. The publisher also created a website concerning the progress of the English version. The English translation was released in November 2016.

== Setting ==

=== Aventuria ===
&quot;The Dark Eye&quot; is set in the fantasy realm of Aventuria. During the 1990s, it was first translated as &quot;Arkania&quot;, but the name was later changed to one closer to the original German name. Aventuria is a continent of the planet Ethra (an anagram of &quot;Earth&quot;, as the planet&#x27;s name in the German edition, Dere, is an anagram of &quot;&quot;, the German word for &quot;Earth&quot;). The other continents of Ethra are Myranor (also called &quot;Gyldenland&quot; in Aventuria), Uthuria and Vaestenland.

=== Tharun ===
Tharun was envisioned as the inner side of Ethra, which was supposed to be a hollow world. It is lit by a central sun which also annihilates the usual magic. In today&#x27;s ingame theory Tharun is a so-called &quot;Globule&quot;, a place in another Sphere of reality – or an alternate dimension (although this explanation is very simplified).

The original sun, Glost, was the work of Guerimm, the god of fire. New gods appeared and started to oppose the twelve gods of Aventuria. One of them, Arkan&#x27;Zim, destroyed Glost, and another new god, Sindayri, created a new sun, aiming to reduce the influence of the twelve gods in the hollow world. The splinters of Glost were spread everywhere. The inhabitants picked them and drew runes on them. They thus became runestones; the combination of three runestones can lead to the liberation of the energy of Glost, allowing a new magic. Tharun is linked to the surface of Ethra by a double-sided volcano. The upper side is on an island 1,400 km west from Havena, the other side is upside down, and is situated in Tharun on the isle of Hamur. The society is a military dictatorship, with a caste of Sword Masters ruling the rest of the population.

=== Myranor ===
Myranor or Gyldenland (In the original &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;Golden country&quot;) is a large continent west of Aventuria. It was first described in 1990 and released as a separate RPG in 2000. Initially, it was used to play-test an early version of what came to be &quot;The Dark Eye&quot; 4th edition rules.

In contrast to Aventuria, the setting is high fantasy. There are gigantic Metropolis, flying ships and cities, several races unknown to aventurians including cat-like humanoids and intelligent insects, as well as a country leached by its vampire-like, skull god &quot;Draydalān&quot; worshiping population. The continent is huge and parts of it still are unexplored. While most of Aventuria is set in the central European Middle Ages, Myranor is based on a mixture of classic Greek/Roman as well as medieval Asian background. One notable political structure is a huge empire that has been in degeneration for millennia. At its height, it had been the origin of modern civilization in Aventuria, and the area it still controls is larger than Aventuria itself. In its early years, the empire was controlled by mighty three-eyed wizards called &quot;the old ones&quot;, who disappeared thousands of years ago.

After its initial release in 2000, only one additional rule book, one regional description and six adventures were released. After those, nothing further was released for Myranor. Two fans, however, revised Myranor to be played with the &quot;final&quot; 4th edition rules with FanPro&#x27;s permission. These new rules were released as a hardcover book in January 2006. On 20 January 2007 Ulisses Spiele announced that they would be handling future publications related to Myranor.

=== Creatures ===

====Humans====
There are three human groups, and several smaller cultures:
* Middenrealmers: from Gyldenland, they landed on the west coast and spread to the centre of Aventuria.
** Andergastans (template: A satirically exaggerated version of the Kingdom of Bavaria and the Archduchy of Austria)
** Bornlanders (template: Russia at the end of the Middle Ages)
** Cyclopeans (template: Ancient Greece and Roman Empire)
** Horasians (template: Italy and France, between the Baroque and the Renaissance)
** Maraskans (template: Asia—an amalgam of Middenrealers and Tulamydes)
** Middenrealmers (template: Germany in the time of Holy Roman Empire in the Middle Ages)
** Northern-Aventurians (template: )
** Nostrians (template: A satirically exaggerated version of Kingdom of Prussia)
** Southern-Aventurians (template: Early colonial Latin America and the Caribbean during the Golden Age of Piracy)
** Svellters (template: A medieval version of the American frontier)
* Tulamydes: natives of Aventuria, probably from the Rashtul Wall; they spread to the south of Aventuria;
** Mhanadistanians (template: caricature of the golden age of Arab civilisation)
** Novadis (template: Bedouin): nomadic people of the desert of Khom;
* Thorwalians (template: Vikings): coming from Hjaldingard in Gyldenland, they settled in northwest Aventuria
* Norbards (template: petty, travelling east-European traders with some allusions to Ashkenazi Jews): an amalgam of Middenrealers and Tulamydes
* Smaller groups, all indigenous to Aventuria:
** Nivese (template: Sami)
** Forest Folk and Utulus, collectively called Mohas (template: Indigenous peoples of the Americas)

====Elves====
* Forest Elves: fairy-like elves, living mostly in a large wood called the Salamander Stones. They are worldly yet innocent, and dislike humans.
* Firn Elves: live in the north, in perpetual ice; for them, life is a hard struggle.
* Meadow Elves: live throughout the northern half of Aventuria along rivers; open-minded, they sometimes live in human cities.
* Veld Elves: horsemen from the grasslands of northeast Aventuria; they have loose contact with humans and Goblins.

The Elves are indigenous cultures, and generally do not believe in gods. Unbeknownst to most Elves, Firn, Meadow and Veld Elves once had a single common culture (like that of Tolkien&#x27;s elves).

====Dwarves====
*Ore Dwarves: conservative, concerned with etiquette
*Anvil Dwarves: aggressive and stubborn
*Brilliant Dwarves: artistic
*Hill Dwarves: similar to Tolkien&#x27;s Hobbits, but here considered Dwarves

====Other====
*Ogres: giants of great strength, these simple-minded, strong creatures are often found in the company of Orcs, swinging large wooden clubs lopped off trees. Common to all Ogres is the consumption of nearly everything they encounter.
*Orks: black-coated, monkey-like species native to the veld (&quot;ork land&quot;) in northwest Aventuria, with a culture similar to the Orcs of Warcraft
*Holberker: a mix between elves and orcs, found only in few areas
*Goblins: smaller relatives of the Orks, with red-brown fur, living mostly in northeastern Aventuria. Goblins are second in numbers only to the humans.
*Achaz: lizard-men, whose ancient culture is now destroyed
*Trolls: large, burly creatures living in the Troll Mountains. Intelligent, they hint at an ancient trollish civilization predating every other.

=== &quot;Dark World&quot; Board Games ===
A board game and two expansion games were released based on the Dark Eye gaming system:
**&quot;Dark World: The Castle of Secrets&quot; (&quot;&quot;) (released as simply &quot;Dark World&quot; in the US)
**&quot;Dark World: Village of Fear&quot; (&quot;&quot;)
**&quot;Dark World: Dragon&#x27;s Gate&quot; (&quot;&quot;)

The games are three-dimensional, where features and structures were built on top of the board, and could also be interacted with the character pieces. The games revolve around a group of Heroes battle against a snake sorcerer named Korak and his minions. The original Dark World game has the Heroes fight through Korak&#x27;s castle. The Village of Fear expansion game requires the Heroes to rescue two townsfolk to retrieve the keys to enter the castle. In the Dragon&#x27;s Gate expansion, the heroes must get past the Dragon Golgorath before they can enter the town. Four players can play each game as the Heroes, while a fifth player plays the role of Korak and controls all his monsters.

The Heroes have a corresponding color on their bases. Each game has a shaker or tokens which determine the order of play for each player for each round. The Hero pieces are also designed to hold interchangeable weapons-a base weapon, and a later, more-powerful gold weapon. Heroes are awarded points based upon collecting certain items, and defeating enemies. Special dice with scimitars inscribed on them are used for combat. The winner is the Hero with the most points at the end of the game or the player playing as Korak wins if all the Heroes are defeated.

<doc id="227314" wikidata="Q2732048" url="?curid=227314" title="Chandler wobble">
<text>The Chandler wobble or Chandler variation of latitude is a small deviation in the Earth&#x27;s axis of rotation relative to the solid earth, which was discovered by and named after American astronomer Seth Carlo Chandler in 1891. It amounts to change of about in the point at which the axis intersects the Earth&#x27;s surface and has a period of 433 days. This wobble, which is an astronomical nutation, combines with another wobble with a period of six years, so that the total polar motion varies with a period of about 7 years.

The Chandler wobble is an example of the kind of motion that can occur for a freely rotating object that is not a sphere; this is called a free nutation. Somewhat confusingly, the direction of the Earth&#x27;s rotation axis relative to the stars also varies with different periods, and these motions—caused by the tidal forces of the Moon and Sun—are also called nutations, except for the slowest, which are precessions of the equinoxes.

==Predictions==
The existence of Earth&#x27;s free nutation was predicted by Isaac Newton in Corollaries 20 to 22 of Proposition 66, Book 1 of the &quot;Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot;, and by Leonhard Euler in 1765 as part of his studies of the dynamics of rotating bodies. Based on the known ellipticity of the Earth, Euler predicted that it would have a period of 305 days. Several astronomers searched for motions with this period, but none was found. Chandler&#x27;s contribution was to look for motions at any possible period; once the Chandler wobble was observed, the difference between its period and the one predicted by Euler was explained by Simon Newcomb as being caused by the non-rigidity of the Earth. The full explanation for the period also involves the fluid nature of the Earth&#x27;s core and oceans—the wobble, in fact, produces a very small ocean tide with an amplitude of approximately , called a &quot;pole tide&quot;, which is the only tide not caused by an extraterrestrial body. Despite the small amplitude, the gravitational effect of the pole tide is easily detected by the superconducting gravimeter.

==Measurement==
The International Latitude Observatories were established in 1899 to measure the wobble as observed in latitude determinations. These provided data on the Chandler and annual wobble for most of the 20th century, though they were eventually superseded by other methods of measurement. Monitoring of the polar motion is now done by the International Earth Rotation Service (IERS).

The wobble&#x27;s amplitude has varied since its discovery, reaching its largest size in 1910 and fluctuating noticeably from one decade to another. In 2009, Malkin &amp; Miller&#x27;s analysis of IERS Pole coordinates time series data from January 1946 to January 2009 showed three phase reversals of the wobble, in 1850, 1920, and 2005.

==Hypotheses==
Since the Earth is not a rigid body, the Chandler wobble should die down with a time constant of about 68 years, a very short period compared to geological timescales. The processes that continually re-excite the wobble are of interest to geophysicists. While it must be due to changes in the mass distribution or angular momentum of the Earth&#x27;s outer core, atmosphere, oceans, or crust (from earthquakes), for a long time the actual source was unclear, since no available motions seemed to be coherent with what was driving the wobble.

An investigation was done in 2001 by Richard Gross at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory managed by the California Institute of Technology. He used angular momentum models of the atmosphere and the oceans in computer simulations to show that from 1985 to 1996, the Chandler wobble was excited by a combination of atmospheric and oceanic processes, with the dominant excitation mechanism being ocean-bottom pressure fluctuations. Gross found that two-thirds of the &quot;wobble&quot; was caused by fluctuating pressure on the seabed, which, in turn, is caused by changes in the circulation of the oceans caused by variations in temperature, salinity, and wind. The remaining third is due to atmospheric pressure fluctuations.

== Chandler wobble of Mars ==
Using 18 years of radio tracking observations of the Mars Odyssey, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft, the Chandler wobble of Mars has been detected. It is the first time it has been detected on a planetary body other than the Earth. The amplitude is 10 cm, the period is 206.9 ± 0.5 days, and it is in a nearly circular counterclockwise direction as viewed from the North Pole.

<doc id="227319" wikidata="Q215813" url="?curid=227319" title="Petter Solberg">
<text>Petter Solberg (born 18 November 1974), nicknamed &quot;Mr. Hollywood&quot; is a Norwegian former professional rally and rallycross driver.

Solberg debuted in the World Rally Championship in 1998 and was signed by the Ford factory team in 1999. The following year, Solberg started his successful partnership with the Subaru World Rally Team.

With the Subaru works team, Solberg finished runner-up to Marcus Grönholm in 2002 and then became the first Norwegian to win the drivers&#x27; world title in 2003. In the following two seasons, he finished runner-up to Sébastien Loeb. Following Subaru&#x27;s withdrawal from the WRC at the end of the 2008 season, Solberg secured private backing to start the Petter Solberg World Rally Team and competed with a Citroën Xsara WRC, a Citroën C4 WRC and a Citroën DS3 WRC. In 2012 Petter returned to a factory team, joining the Ford World Rally Team 12 years after making his WRC debut with the same team.

He switched to rallycross for the 2013 season, and in the 2014 he became the inaugural winner of the FIA World Rallycross Championship, after five race wins and nine podium finishes. He repeated his title success the following year. In 2017, Petter set up the PSRX Volkswagen Sweden team in partnership with Volkswagen Motorsport, and won the Team&#x27;s Championship in both 2017 and 2018 before his retirement from full-time motorsport.

Solberg&#x27;s son, Oliver Solberg, is also a rally driver; they have regularly competed together at the Race of Champions.

==Career==

===Early career===
Solberg won a nationwide RC car championship the Norwegian Tamiya Cup in 1987 at the age of 13 as he inherited his interest of motorsport through his parents, mother Tove and father Terje, who were keen &quot;bilcross&quot; (an &quot;inexpensive version&quot; of Norwegian rallycross, similar to Swedish folkrace and Finnish &quot;jokamiehenluokka&quot;) competitors and rallycross enthusiasts. He used to help out around the home farm rebuilding competition cars, as he was not yet old enough to drive. Solberg entered his first &quot;bilcross&quot; in 1992, three days after his 18th birthday and only one day after he got his driving license. He went on to become Norwegian champion in rallycross as well as hillclimb in both 1995 (winning 19 out of 21 events) and 1996 (winning 15 out of 19 events). In 1995 he took part in his maiden rally, the Norwegian Rally Bjørkelangen, by driving a Volvo 240 in the &quot;Volvo Original&quot; class. His female co-driver by then was Maud from Sweden, nowadays spouse of his older brother Henning. In 1998 Solberg became the Norwegian Rally Champion, his brother Henning won this title five times in a row between 1999 and 2003.

===WRC career===
By this time and with the aid of his compatriot John Haugland, who helped him on events in the late 1990s, the World Rally Championship team bosses were starting to recognize Solberg&#x27;s potential and by the end of 1998, after winning a comparative test drive, he agreed to drive for three years as a junior pilot for the Ford Motor Company. Initially expected by Malcolm Wilson to maintain a somewhat lower profile, Solberg actually became a nominated points-scorer for Ford on, of all events, the gruelling test that was the Safari Rally in early 1999, after usual understudy to the team&#x27;s star driver Colin McRae, Thomas Rådström, suffered an injury and was subsequently ruled out from taking part. He stunned many by finishing in 5th place and scoring both drivers and manufacturers points.

====2000–04====

In 2000 however, Solberg was able to leave Ford&#x27;s M-Sport outfit prematurely, due to an insufficient contract, to sign with the Subaru World Rally Team (SWRT), then led by a driving staff of Richard Burns and Juha Kankkunen. His first podium had to wait until the Acropolis Rally, Greece the following year, as an altruistic Solberg forsook as many of his own points as possible, as he did in dropping voluntarily from 4th to 5th in Corsica, to assist his senior teammate Burns in sneaking to the title.

In 2002 with four-time champion Tommi Mäkinen installed as his new teammate in the light of Burns&#x27; departure to Peugeot, Solberg won his first ever WRC event in Wales (Wales Rally GB) after a consistent display of driving prowess and an unlikely accident by Marcus Grönholm. In 2003 Solberg entered the final event, the Wales Rally GB, with himself, Citroën-mounted Sébastien Loeb and Burns in contention for the title. Burns withdrew before the event for health reasons and Solberg finished ahead of Loeb, launching him to his second win in Wales and his first and only World Rally Championship title. Solberg became the first Norwegian to win the drivers&#x27; world title.

In his title defence however, Solberg&#x27;s winning of five of a possible sixteen events, including the hat-trick making Wales Rally GB, proved insufficient to deny the title to a now increasingly efficient Loeb. On Solberg&#x27;s part, a perhaps unfortunate string of bad luck was encapsulated by three DNFs (retirements) in mid-season.

====2005====

Welcoming a new teammate for the year in Australian Chris Atkinson, who replaced the disappointing Finn who had been the former Champion&#x27;s SWRT teammate throughout 2004, Mikko Hirvonen, Solberg started his 2005 season brightly as he sought an immediate answer to Loeb, the Norwegian winning two of the first three events, in Sweden and Mexico. These successes coincided with the early seizing of a championship lead. He was, however, soon overtaken by a rampant Loeb, and was left to score 71 points for the year, pipping Peugeot&#x27;s Marcus Grönholm to the championship runner-up spot on a tie break.

He added an unwanted Wales Rally GB win after the death in a day three crash of fellow competitor Markko Märtin&#x27;s co-driver, Michael Park, with Loeb sacrificing his victory on the road in order to avoid having to simultaneously celebrate the title. This would prove to be his final WRC victory. Solberg won three rallies in all, though was severely affected by bad luck while challenging for wins at the end of the season, most notably on the Telstra Rally Australia, where he was forced to retire after striking a wayward kangaroo.

====2006====

For 2006, Solberg continued his partnership with the Subaru team, driving a new version of the Impreza WRC. His main sponsor was 24SevenOffice with a 5 million kroner sponsorship deal, a Norwegian record. His results, though, proved patchy in comparison to Loeb. While Loeb went on to register five rally victories on the bounce in a privately (Kronos) run Citroën Xsara WRC, his winning of the title unhampered even by breaking his arm at an advanced stage of the season, Solberg could only comparatively muster a handful of runner-up places on rallies all season — in Mexico, Argentina and Australia. Failure to claw his way any higher than sixth in the year&#x27;s final points standings duly brought an end to the chain of top three drivers&#x27; championship appearances which Subaru had enjoyed since 1994.

====2007====
The Norwegian did, at least, get his 2007 season off to a rather more auspicious start, managing a joint-career-best finish of sixth place on the Rally Monte Carlo. He surrendered a potential third-place finish in Sweden after a substantial time loss, as well as being bested by his brother, Henning, in the race for the final podium place on the siblings&#x27; home event – Rally Norway. In Mexico, Argentina and Sardinia Solberg struggled with his Impreza — technical problems caused two retirements and a plummet down the leaderboard in Italy. Good pace in Portugal and taking third place on the Acropolis Rally at least appeared to mark a turnaround in the quality of the younger Solberg&#x27;s results, although even Greek event wasn&#x27;t problem-free for the Norwegian as he experienced some damper problems.

Despite Subaru&#x27;s confidence in their car performance and reliability built up during summer break tests, Impreza S12A failed again — Solberg had to retire on day two in Finland, after monstrous handling and steering problems which the engineers were unable to deal with. On the next round, Rallye Deutschland, where he finished sixth, the car by itself was reliable, but the Norwegian hit a rock on SS5 heavily damaging the steering, which had cost him considerable amount of time because the team wasn&#x27;t able to fully repair it. The New Zealand event was another problem-ridden outing for Solberg — he described the handling difficulties as similar to those he had experienced in Finland earlier.
At the next round on Rally Catalunya, it was a difficult rally for Solberg  — he struggled to maintain a good pace and in the end finished sixth, almost 3 minutes adrift from the winner, Loeb. He was however pleased with changes in car setup made for day 3, which seemed promising for the following Tour de Corse. Unfortunately for the Norwegian, the setup wasn&#x27;t as good and he had problems with handling again which, along with a stalled engine on the start of SS5, resulted in a disappointing fifth place, behind young Finn Jari-Matti Latvala. In Japan, his team&#x27;s home event, Solberg clocked several top-ten times on the early stages, but crashed badly on SS5 then, probably due to damage sustained in accident, his gearbox locked in sixth gear, forcing his retirement for the day. He later rejoined the competition under the SupeRally format and finished 16th, managing to score two points in the Manufacturers&#x27; Championship. On the day of his 33rd birthday, Solberg finished fifth on Rally Ireland, calling it &quot;the most difficult rally he has ever done&quot;; he had also found his car&#x27;s performance better than in previous events.

On the final event of the season, Wales Rally GB, Solberg had consistent pace and won the battle for fourth with Spaniard Dani Sordo even though the Norwegian hit a rock in the morning and again had some minor handling issues. This result allowed Subaru to retain their third place in the Manufacturers&#x27; Championship, and Solberg ended the 2007 season in fifth place overall. He also took part in the 2007 Race of Champions, representing Norway, along with his brother, Henning. He didn&#x27;t manage to win the first race with David Coulthard, but in Nation&#x27;s Cup Norwegian brothers made their way to the semi-finals.

====2008====

For the 2008 season, Solberg and Atkinson were retained by SWRT as driving staff. Solberg started his season with a fifth place in Monte Carlo and fourth in Sweden, but went on to retire or finish outside point-scoring positions in the following four events. A radical new hatchback homologation of the long-serving Subaru Impreza, the WRC2008, debuted on the Acropolis Rally, marked by the Norwegian collecting a runner-up spot to Sébastien Loeb.

Although Solberg went on to break his personal record in consecutive point-scoring finishes, Acropolis remained his only podium of the season. He finished sixth overall in the drivers&#x27; championship, four points behind teammate Chris Atkinson, while Subaru took third place in the manufacturers&#x27; standings.

====2009====
Subaru announced on 16 December 2008 that they would not be participating in the World Rally Championship any longer, a mere day after Suzuki announced their withdrawal. Solberg and co-driver Phil Mills were left without a ride. Looking at their options with the remaining teams they had to sit out the 2009 season opening Rally Ireland.
After careful evaluation of several privateer options including Ford and Citroën cars, Solberg confirmed having acquired (most likely leased) a Citroën Xsara WRC (in 2006 WRC spec) as of 25 January 2009, and that Phil Mills and himself would return to the WRC in a privateer team for the 2009 Rally Norway. On 1 February 2009, Solberg indicated that five sponsors for the 2009 season were in place. The sponsors announced were Microsoft, Pareto, Hurtigruta Carglass and two undisclosed sponsors.
On 6 February 2009, Solberg officially unveiled the Petter Solberg World Rally Team, with himself as driver and Phil Mills as codriver. The team served Solberg and his 2006-spec. Citroën Xsara WRC with active suspension and diffs. A 13-member team, PSWRT employed ex-Subaru World Rally Team members Ken Rees as team manager, and François-Xavier &quot;FX&quot; Demaison as chief engineer. The PSWRT also returned Solberg&#x27;s personal friend and ex-SWRT member, Tore Dahl, to the WRC scene as a mechanic. Swede Sven-Inge Neby, for about 40 years the engineer of Petter&#x27;s father-in-law Per-Inge Walfridsson and his brothers Lars-Erik Walfridsson and Stig-Olov Walfridsson, is another support to the international team.

It took some time to adapt to the new car during their first round in Norway, but eventually Solberg and Mills managed to secure a sixth place and three points in the drivers&#x27; championship. Following that result and a new engine from Citroën, Solberg finished third in the Cyprus Rally, being the first true privateer in a privately run team to be in the podium since Malcolm Wilson back in 1993. Solberg managed to repeat this feat in Sardinia.

Solberg and Mills retained their consistent fight for 3rd and 4th position through the three next rallies; Portugal, Argentina (Retired from 3rd position due to loss of fuel pressure on the final stage) and Italy. Solberg &quot;threatened&quot; to swap to a Peugeot 307 WRC, unless he got the 2006 spec upgrades for his Xsara. He received the upgrades (mainly improved intercooler and mechanical differentials) for Sardinia, which made them able to defend a 3rd place, in very hot conditions. Solberg expressed that they were unable to push harder in hot temperatures, and remained open to analyze what to do for the next events. Solberg was believed to be in talks of upgrading to a Peugeot 307 CC but decided to stick with the Xsara. After retiring from Rally Finland, Solberg decided to miss Australia to concentrate on finding a more competitive car. After testing a Citroën C4 WRC in France, and a Ford Focus RS WRC in Britain, Solberg confirmed he would drive a C4 at the final two rounds of the season, Rally Catalunya and Wales Rally GB. The car was to be a 2008-spec C4, but would feature updates to bring it as close as possible to the factory cars of Sébastien Loeb and Dani Sordo. Solberg continued to drive for his own Petter Solberg World Rally Team for Catalunya, but was a nominated points scorer for the Citroën Junior Team at Wales Rally GB, alongside Sébastien Ogier. He finished in 4th position in both of these events, and ended up 5th in the overall 2009 Drivers&#x27; Championship standings.

====2010====

Solberg announced on 12 January 2010 that he had purchased two Citroën C4 WRC (2009-spec) cars from Citroën and that he would compete in the 2010 World Rally Championship.
On the Swedish Rally Solberg was unable to find the rhythm and pace, and finished 9th earning him 2 points. At the second round of the season, the Corona Mexico Rally, Solberg held the lead after day 1, with a 27sec gap down to Loeb on 3rd. With Solberg sweeping the road on Saturday Loeb advanced to a 55 sec lead by the end of the day, with Solberg on 2nd place 2.7 sec ahead of Sébastien Ogier. A great battle for 2nd place played out on Sunday, with Solberg trailing Ogier with 0.6sec going into the last super special stage. Solberg sat a fastest stage time here by 1.4 sec which secured the 2nd place podium finish, marking the best result by PSWRT to date. In the third Round of the season, Rally Jordan, Solberg trailed Latvala (−16s), Ogier (−19s) and Loeb (−43s) going into the last day. Ogier was sacrificed in a new level of tactics, sending him out as first car as road sweeper for Loeb, while receiving penalties and losing his good position. The exploiting of the rules received much criticism, and was subsequently banned for the next rally. The other drivers kept their position with Solberg scoring a 3rd place podium. In Rally Turkey, 16–18 April, Solberg held a good position through the whole rally, and had a serious chance to battle for the victory on the last day, positioned 2nd on the road, 16sec after Loeb. With several stages canceled on safety reasons due to too much mud, and later a scary meet with a tree on the slippery conditions, Solberg wisely stopped fighting and conceded to secure the 2nd place. Hirvonen, Latvala, Sordo and Ogier all had incidents/offs, hindering them to challenge Solbergs position. This result put Solberg second in the Driver&#x27;s Championship standings, 1 point ahead of Hirvonen and 6 points ahead of Latvala, but a full 40 points after Loeb, with 4 out of 13 rallies completed. In Rally New Zealand Solberg made a tactical blunder, simply by not adapting any road position tactics, and finished in first position on day 1, with a marginal lead. Sweeping Saturday&#x27;s stages left him 54 sec behind, in 5th place, realistically out of reach of a win. But for the final 30 km stage of the rally, four drivers were within 18 seconds of the lead, which led to an epic four-way battle for the victory, between Ogier, Latvala, Solberg and Loeb. Three of them took a maximum-attack, high-risk approach, which none of them managed to complete without incident. Ogier and Loeb both had a spin that cost them some seconds, and Solberg going too fast around a high speed bend hit a telegraph pole on the road shoulder and retired from 3rd position. Latvala did no serious mistakes and took his 3rd WRC win by 2.4 seconds. Loeb crashed two times during this rally, but still managed to finish only 15 seconds behind.
On 11 June 2010, PSWRT announced that Phil Mills have decided to leave the codriver seat to focus on other things in life. This brings to an end a 152-event unbroken run of the pair competing together, over 11 years since 1999. In their time they have driven for Ford, Subaru and for their own Citroën team, winning 13 individual world rallies and the 2003 world title. 29 June PSWRT announced that Chris Patterson would be Solberg&#x27;s new codriver.

In their first rally together, the tarmac event Rally Bulgaria, Solberg and Patterson put in an impressive performance; five stage wins and finished third, 6.8 seconds off Dani Sordo in second place.

After more podiums in Japan, France and Spain, Solberg finished second on Rally GB, securing his goal of finishing in the top three in the championship.

====2011====
On 14 January 2011, PSWRT confirmed that Solberg will compete in the 2011 World Rally Championship in a Citroën DS3 WRC.

In February, Solberg had his driving licence suspended in Sweden after police caught him travelling 32 km/h above the speed limit on the way to the fifth stage of the country&#x27;s WRC round, forcing co-driver Chris Patterson to take up the wheel.



====2012====
In December 2011, Ford confirmed that Solberg will return to the factory team of Ford in 2012.
Round 1 in Monte-Carlo saw Solberg&#x27;s first podium finishing in third. Sweden saw the Norwegian come 4th. Mexico brought Solberg another podium in third. A round later in Portugal he finished fourth before Mikko Hirvonen was stripped of his victory because the car violated some regulations. After that he was promoted to third place giving him yet another podium, and higher location in the overall standings in second, 4 points behind leader, Loeb. On 4 December 2012 Solberg confirmed he would sit out of the WRC 2013 season.

===ERX and WRX career===
====2013====
In 2013 Solberg changed discipline, competing in all nine rounds of the FIA European Rallycross Championship (ERX) with his own team, based in Torsby. After a lot of bad luck, including retiring while leading in Finland, he eventually finished the season 8th overall in the Supercars category.

====2014====
In 2014 he became the first ever FIA World Rallycross Champion (WRX) with his PSRX Citroën DS3 Supercar. Therefore, he is also the first driver ever to claim FIA World titles in two different motorsports.

====2015====
Solberg partnered with Liam Doran to compete for the &quot;Solberg Doran Rallycross (SDRX)&quot; team in the 2015 season. He successfully defended his WRX title with this Citroën DS3, clinching the title in the final round of the championship at Rosario in Argentina.

====2016====
In 2016, Solberg continued in the FIA World Rallycross Championship with a privateer Supercars class Citroën DS3. He won the first round at Portugal, and got three further podiums and a total of eight top 5 finishes, finishing 4th in the overall standings.
====2017–2018====
2017 saw Petter team up with Volkswagen Motorsport to create PSRX Volkswagen Sweden, driving the Polo GTi RX, and the team quickly became a dominant force in World RX. Petter achieved his final World RX win at the legendary Lydden Hill in 2017, and by the end of the year the team were crowned Team&#x27;s Champions, Petter finished 3rd, and teammate Johan Kristoffersson won his first World Championship title.

In 2018 the team remained the same, albeit driving the rebranded Polo R, and for the second year running the team won the Team&#x27;s Championship - this time in even more dominant fashion. Across 24 events in 2017 and 2018, PSRX won 19 of them – a level never before seen in the sport.

Petter also made a brief rally comeback and took part in the 2018 Rally Catalunya to give the Volkswagen Polo R5 its WRC debut, and finished in a podium position with 3rd place in the WRC2 category.

====2019–present ====
Petter retired from full-time motorsport at the end of 2018, but did complete a &#x27;Farewell Tour&#x27; in 2019 consisting of some of his favourite events. He set the fastest RX lap at the Goodwood Festival of Speed, set the lap record at the Norges Råeste Bakkeløp, won Gymkhana Grid and signed off from his WRC career with one final class win at the 2019 Wales Rally GB.

Since then Petter has been a constant and supportive presence in his son&#x27;s life as Oliver Solberg followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps and reached the World Rally Championship. In 2022, the Solbergs won the Race of Champions&#x27; Nations Cup for Team Norway.

===Gymkhana Grid===
Solberg won the AWD class of the 2016 Gymkhana Grid at Marathon with a Citroën Xsara. In 2018, he finished second at Johannesburg with a Volkswagen Polo. In 2019 he won the event at Warsaw, again driving a VW Polo.

==Personal life==
Solberg was born in Askim, but grew up in Spydeberg. He is the younger brother to Henning Solberg. He is married to a Swede, Pernilla Solberg (née Walfridsson), with whom he has a son, Oliver Solberg, who is now a driver in the WRC himself. Pernilla is the daughter of former Volvo factory driver and 1980 European Rallycross Champion, Per-Inge &quot;Pi&quot; Walfridsson (who also claimed a remarkable fourth overall in the 1973 RAC Rally). Pernilla was also, for some time, one of the world&#x27;s leading female rally drivers. Solberg lives with his family in Mitandersfors, Sweden.

Post-driving career, Solberg was diagnosed with ADHD.

<doc id="227321" wikidata="Q5281174" url="?curid=227321" title="Disability Discrimination Act 1995">
<text>The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (c. 50) (informally, and hereafter, the DDA) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which has now been repealed and replaced by the Equality Act 2010, except in Northern Ireland where the Act still applies. Formerly, it made it unlawful to discriminate against people in respect of their disabilities in relation to employment, the provision of goods and services, education and transport.

The DDA is a civil rights law. Other countries use constitutional, social rights or criminal law to make similar provisions. The Equality and Human Rights Commission combats discrimination. Equivalent legislation exists in Northern Ireland, which is enforced by the Northern Ireland Equality Commission.

==History==
The Act was the culmination of a public campaign, and at least 100,000 people in demonstrations, to force the government to end state and business discrimination against disabled people. While the Race Relations Act 1976 and the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 guaranteed minimum standards for equality on grounds of race and gender, there had been very little concerning disabled people. Prior to the DDA, the first attempt to deal with the issue of disability was the Disabled Persons (Employment) Act 1944. This made it a legal requirement for companies with over 250 employees to employ a quota of disabled persons. This failed as there was not now anyone appointed to monitor these rights and as such was toothless.

==Service providers==
The Act placed duties on service providers and required &quot;reasonable adjustments&quot; to be made when providing access to goods, facilities, services and premises. These were introduced in three stages:

* Since 2 December 1994, it has been unlawful for service providers to treat disabled people less favourably for a reason related to their disability;
* Since 1 October 2002, service providers have had to make &#x27;reasonable adjustments&#x27; for disabled people, such as providing extra help or making changes to the way they provide their services.
* Since 1 October 2004, service providers may have to make other &#x27;reasonable adjustments&#x27; in relation to the physical features of their premises to overcome physical barriers to access.

==Amending legislation==
The Act was amended by the following legislation in Great Britain (but not Northern Ireland, where different amendments apply):

* The Disability Rights Commission Act 1999, which replaced the National Disability Council with the Disability Rights Commission (DRC);
* The Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001 inserted new provisions in Part 4 of the DDA 1995 in connection with disability discrimination in schools and other educational establishments;
* The Private Hire Vehicles (Carriage of Guide Dogs etc.) Act 2002, which prevented operators of such vehicles refusing to take assistance dogs, or making additional charges for such dogs.
* The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (Amendment) Regulations 2003, and the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (Pensions) Regulations 2003 which amended the DDA in line with the EU employment directive.
* The Disability Discrimination Act 2005, which completed the implementation of the Disability Rights Task Force recommendations, including the extension of the DDA 1995 to cover public transport, and the introduction of a duty on public authorities to promote equality for disabled people.
*The Equality Act 2006 which transferred the role of the Disability Rights Commission to the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC). The EHRC took on this role from 1 October 2007, and has powers to issue guidance on and enforce all the equality enactments (covering race, sex, disability, religion and belief, sexual orientation and age).

==Principles==

The DDA 1995 departed from the fundamental principles of older UK discrimination law (the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 and the Race Relations Act 1976). These Acts, also repealed and replaced by the Equality Act 2010, made direct discrimination and indirect discrimination unlawful. However, these concepts are insufficient to deal with the issues of disability discrimination.

The core concepts in the DDA 1995 are, instead:
* less favourable treatment for a reason related to a disabled person&#x27;s disability; and
* failure to make a &quot;reasonable adjustment&quot;.

&quot;Reasonable adjustment&quot; or, as it is known in some other jurisdictions, &#x27;reasonable accommodation&#x27;, is the radical concept that makes the DDA 1995 so different from the older legislation. Instead of the rather passive approach of indirect discrimination (where someone can take action if they have been disadvantaged by a policy, practice or criterion that a body with duties under the law has adopted), reasonable adjustment is an active approach that requires employers, service providers etc. to take steps to remove barriers from disabled people&#x27;s participation. For example:

* employers are likely to find it reasonable to provide accessible IT equipment;
* many shops are likely to find it reasonable to make their premises accessible to wheelchair users;
* councils are likely to find it reasonable to provide information in alternative formats (such as large print) as well as normal written form.

The Disability Rights Commission&#x27;s Codes of Practice give more information to bodies with duties on assessing whether a particular adjustment is reasonable. In general, the factors to consider would include:
* whether the proposed adjustment would meet the needs of the disabled person;
* whether the adjustment is affordable;
* whether the adjustment would have a serious effect on other people.

Sometimes there may be no reasonable adjustment, and the outcome is that a disabled person is treated less favourably. For example, if a person was not able to understand the implications of entering into a mortgage or loan agreement, and they did not have anyone authorised to act for them, it would not make sense to require a bank or building society to enter into that agreement. The Act therefore permits employers and service providers to justify less favourable treatment (and in some instances failure to make a reasonable adjustment) in certain circumstances.

An example would be a medieval castle open for public tours that didn&#x27;t have modifications made for wheelchairs. To do so would destroy the castle&#x27;s historical aspects such as the restrictive nature of the original circular staircases.

==Housing==
The system of protection of disabled people, especially those with mental health problems to keep their homes, has been greatly enhanced by certain recent rulings in the UK Court of Appeal—City of Manchester v Romano.

Under the act it is unlawful to discriminate against a disabled person by evicting them or subjecting them to other detriment unless justified under the limited number of justifications set out in the act.

In practice the only relevant justification is that the landlord believes and also that it is objectively necessary for the protection of the health or safety of the disabled person or someone else.

Where the cause of the taking of proceedings is e.g. rent arrears which was caused by the disability e.g. by Housing Benefit being cancelled through non response to correspondence and the non response was caused by the disability, then not only is it discrimination, but it is discrimination which cannot be justified on the grounds allowed in the act.

This applies whether or not the landlord knew of the disability.

This applies even if 
:the landlord has a mandatory ground for possession, e.g.
::two months rent arrears or
::two months notice no reason in cases of assured shorthold tenancy where the actual reason is rent arrears
:the tenancy is one where there is no statutory system of protection, e.g.
::where in LA temporary accommodation under the homelessness duty
::the tenancy is a business tenancy

The tenant may counter-claim and seek an injunction restraining the landlord from continuing the possession proceedings.

The judges were very worried about the extent of the law and urged Parliament to change it. However, there has since been a new act of Parliament and there was no weakening of this protection.

<doc id="227322" wikidata="Q201526" url="?curid=227322" title="Battle of Issus">
<text>The Battle of Issus (also Issos) occurred in southern Anatolia, on 5 November 333 BC between the Hellenic League led by Alexander the Great and the Achaemenid Empire, led by Darius III. It was the second great battle of Alexander&#x27;s conquest of Asia, and the first encounter between Darius III and Alexander the Great. The battle resulted in the Macedonian troops defeating the Persian forces. 

After the Hellenic League soundly defeated the Persian satraps of Asia Minor (led by Greek mercenary Memnon of Rhodes) at the Battle of the Granicus, Darius took personal command of his army. He gathered reinforcements and proceeded to lead his men in a surprise march behind the Hellenic advance, in order to cut off their line of supply. Alexander was forced to countermarch, and the stage was set for the battle near the mouth of the Pinarus River and the city of Issus.

==Location==
The battle took place south of the ancient city Issus, which is close to the present-day Turkish city of Iskenderun (the Turkish equivalent of &quot;Alexandria&quot;, founded by Alexander to commemorate his victory), on either side of a small river called Pinarus. At that location, the distance from the Gulf of Issus to the surrounding mountains is only , a place where Darius could not take advantage of his superiority in numbers. Speculation on the location of the Pinarus has taken place for over 80 years. Older historians believed it to be the Deli Tchai river, but historians N.G.L. Hammond and A. M. Devine claim that the Pinarus is actually the Payas River, the latter using his own examination of the course of the river, which he considered would not have drastically changed since antiquity. Their evidence is based on Callisthenes&#x27; accounts of the measurements of the battlefield and distances marched by both sides&#x27; armies in the prelude to the battle and distance given by Diodorus after the battle.

==Background==

Alexander set out into Asia in 334 BC and defeated the local Persian satraps at the Battle of the Granicus. He then proceeded to occupy most of Asia Minor, with the idea of capturing all coastal settlements so as to negate the power of the vastly superior Persian fleet. He captured several important settlements such as Miletus in 334 BC and Halicarnassus. While Alexander was in Tarsus, he heard of Darius massing a great army in Babylon. If Darius were to reach the Gulf of Issus, he could use the support from the Persian fleet under Pharnabazus still operating in the Mediterranean Sea, thus easing his supply and possibly landing troops behind the enemy. Alexander kept his main army at Tarsus but sent Parmenion ahead to occupy the coast around Issus. In November, Alexander received reports that the great Persian army had advanced into Syria to a town named Sochoi. Alexander decided to mass his scattered army and advance south from Issus through the Pass of Jonah.

Darius knew that Parmenion held the Pass of Jonah and thus chose a northern route of advance. The Persians captured Issus without opposition and cut off the hands of all the sick and wounded that Alexander had left behind. Now Darius found out he had placed his army behind the Hellenic League and had cut their supply lines. He then advanced to the south and got no further than the river Pinarus before his scouts spotted Alexander marching north. Darius had to set up camp on this narrow coastal plain.

==Motives==

There is much debate as to the motives of Alexander and Darius preceding Issus. One modern perspective, based on Curtius, is that Darius was forced to move camp to terrain that favored Alexander because Alexander was fighting defensively due to a recommendation by his war council and Parmenion. Darius&#x27; large army could not be supported in the field during winter and his cities in Phoenicia were already in unrest at the arrival of Alexander. Darius was forced to move his large army to a small battlefield, greatly to the advantage of Alexander&#x27;s smaller force.

Alexander was waiting for Darius to come south around the Amanus Mountain range because the pass Darius would have used, the Belen Pass, was much closer to Sochi and offered the quickest access to the area Alexander defended. Alexander was waiting to the west of the Belen Pass at Myriandus to spring a trap on Darius as he crossed through the Belen Pass or through the Pillar of Jonah if he moved north, where Darius&#x27; army would be disorganized and disjointed in the narrow crossing. Darius instead moved north from Sochi and around the mountains, through the Amanic Gate or another nearby pass, emerging behind Alexander&#x27;s position and on his supply and communication lines. Thus Alexander was forced to march to Darius, who had caught him off guard in a large flanking maneuver. This gives the illusion that Darius was the one acting defensively, since Alexander was forced to march to him.

==Combatants==
===Persian army===
Some ancient sources (Arrian and Plutarch), who based their accounts on earlier Greek sources, estimated 600,000 Persian soldiers in total, while Diodorus and Justin estimated 400,000, and Curtius Rufus estimated 250,000.

Modern historians find Arrian&#x27;s count of 600,000 men highly unlikely. They argue that the logistics of fielding more than 100,000 soldiers in battle was extremely difficult at the time. Hans Delbrück gives an estimate as small as 25,000, although most (including Engels and Green) estimate the total size of Darius&#x27; army to be no larger than 100,000 at Issus, including 11,000 cavalry, 10,000 Persian Immortals, and 10,000 Greek mercenaries. Warry estimates 108,000 in total.

===Hellenic army===
The size of the Hellenic army may not have exceeded 40,000 men, including their other allies, led by Alexander. Alexander&#x27;s army may have consisted of about 24,000 heavy infantry (9,000 phalangites, 3,000 hypaspists and 7,000 allied and 5,000 mercenary Greek hoplites), 13,000 light infantry (peltasts, archers, slingers) and 5,850 cavalry.

==Battle==
The Greeks advanced through the Pillar of Jonah. Alexander led his Companion cavalry on the right flank and he set his Thessalian allied cavalry on the left of the phalanx with Parmenion in command.
Darius formed his line with his heavy cavalry concentrated next to the coast on his right, followed by the Greek mercenary phalanx (historian A. M. Devine places them at a strength of 12,000, comparable to Alexander&#x27;s Greek phalanx). Next to the Greek phalanx Darius spread his Persian infantry, the Cardaces, along the river and into the foothills, where they wrapped around to the other bank and threatened Alexander&#x27;s right flank (the formation resembled &quot;gamma&quot;, Γ). Arrian gives an inflated figure of 20,000 to these troops. Darius positioned himself in the centre with the Greek mercenaries, his royal cavalry guard, and his best infantry. According to some historians, like P. Stratikis, he was trying to replicate the Hellenic battle formation of the Battle of the Granicus.
The Persian cavalry first charged Parmenion and the allied cavalry, crossing the river to open battle. Alexander&#x27;s right wing became the crux of the battle, as at Gaugamela two years later, where Parmenion held the left wing long enough against superior Persian numbers for Alexander to make his calculated cavalry strike against Darius and break the Persian army. The infantry of the Greek left flank was commanded by the general Craterus, in a promotion from his position commanding a single brigade of &quot;pezhetairoi&quot; infantry at the Granicus.
Things did not go well for the Macedonians in the beginning. Their center phalanx, having to advance across a river and up a fortified bank, suffered severely against the Greek mercenaries waiting for them on the other side. Arrian noted that a hundred and twenty Macedonians &quot;of note&quot; (probably meaning officers) were slain here, and the Macedonians were forced to retreat across the river. In the left flank, the Thessalian struggled against the outnumbering mass of Persian heavy horse that faced them, delivering charges and retreating again to buy time.

Then the Hypaspists led by Alexander on foot delivered an assault on the Cardaces, and managed to punch a hole through the Persian line. The Agrianians too drove back a mass of Persian skirmishers menacing Alexander&#x27;s far right, securing the flank of the Companions. Alexander then mounted a horse at the head of his Companions and led a direct assault against Darius and his bodyguards, causing them to flee from the battlefield. Alexander then saw his left flank and center in trouble, and allowing Darius to flee, he crashed into the rear of the Greek mercenaries. The Greek mercenaries broke up and started retreating from the battlefield as well. The Persians saw that their Great King had gone and that the battle was being lost, and they abandoned their positions and fled in full rout. The Hellenic cavalry pursued the fleeing Persians for as long as there was light. As with most ancient battles, significant carnage occurred after the battle as the pursuing Greeks slaughtered their crowded, disorganized foe. Arrian notes Ptolemy mentioning that while pursuing Darius, Alexander and his bodyguards came upon a ravine which they easily crossed on the piled up bodies of dead Persians. It was a decisive victory for Alexander.

==Aftermath==

The Battle of Issus was a decisive Hellenic victory and it marked the beginning of the end of Persian power. It was the first time the Persian army had been defeated with the King (Darius III at the time) present. After the battle, the Hellenes captured Darius&#x27; wife, Stateira I, his daughters, Stateira II and Drypetis, and his mother, Sisygambis, all of whom had accompanied Darius on his campaign. Alexander, who later married Stateira II, treated the captured women with great respect.

Later, the Spartan king Agis III recruited the Greek mercenary survivors of the Battle of Issus who had served in the Persian army, a force of 8,000 veterans, and used them in his fight against the Macedonians. In the summer of 331 BC, Agis defeated Coragus, the Macedonian general in command of the Peloponnese and the garrison of Corinth, but was finally defeated at the Battle of Megalopolis.

<doc id="227323" wikidata="Q276082" url="?curid=227323" title="Wilson's theorem">
<text>In algebra and number theory, Wilson&#x27;s theorem states that a natural number &quot;n&quot; &gt; 1 is a prime number if and only if the product of all the positive integers less than &quot;n&quot; is one less than a multiple of &quot;n&quot;. That is (using the notations of modular arithmetic), the factorial formula_1 satisfies

:formula_2

exactly when &quot;n&quot; is a prime number. In other words, any integer &quot;n&quot; &gt; 1 is a prime number if, and only if, (&quot;n&quot; − 1)! + 1 is divisible by &quot;n&quot;.

==History==
The theorem was first stated by Ibn al-Haytham . Edward Waring announced the theorem in 1770 without proving it, crediting his student John Wilson for the discovery. Lagrange gave the first proof in 1771. There is evidence that Leibniz was also aware of the result a century earlier, but never published it.

==Example==
For each of the values of &quot;n&quot; from 2 to 30, the following table shows the number (&quot;n&quot; − 1)! and the remainder when (&quot;n&quot; − 1)! is divided by &quot;n&quot;. (In the notation of modular arithmetic, the remainder when &quot;m&quot; is divided by &quot;n&quot; is written &quot;m&quot; mod &quot;n&quot;.)
The background color is blue for prime values of &quot;n&quot;, gold for composite values.
==Proofs==
As a biconditional (if and only if) statement, the proof has two halves: to show that equality &quot;does not&quot; hold when formula_3 is composite, and to show that it &quot;does&quot; hold when formula_3 is prime.

===Composite modulus===
Suppose that formula_3 is composite. Therefore, it is divisible by some prime number formula_6 where formula_7. Because formula_6 divides formula_3, there is an integer formula_10 such that formula_11. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that formula_12 were congruent to formula_13 modulo formula_14. Then formula_15 would also be congruent to formula_13 modulo formula_17: indeed, if formula_18 then formula_19 for some integer formula_20, and consequently formula_15 is one less than a multiple of formula_6. On the other hand, since formula_23, one of the factors in the expanded product formula_24 is formula_6. Therefore formula_26. This is a contradiction; therefore it is not possible that formula_27 when formula_3 is composite.

In fact, more is true. With the sole exception of the case formula_29, where formula_30, if formula_3 is composite then formula_32 is congruent to 0 modulo formula_3. The proof can be divided into two cases: First, if formula_3 can be factored as the product of two unequal numbers, formula_35, where formula_36, then both formula_37 and formula_38 will appear as factors in the product formula_39 and so formula_32 is divisible by formula_41. If formula_3 has no such factorization, then it must be the square of some prime formula_6 larger than 2. But then formula_44, so both formula_6 and formula_46 will be factors of formula_15, and so formula_3 divides formula_15 in this case, as well.

===Prime modulus===

The first two proofs below use the fact that the residue classes modulo a prime number form a finite field (specifically, a prime field).

====Elementary proof====

The result is trivial when formula_50, so assume formula_51 is an odd prime, formula_52. Since the residue classes modulo formula_51 form a field, every non-zero residue formula_37 has a unique multiplicative inverse formula_55. Euclid&#x27;s lemma implies that the only values of formula_37 for which formula_57 are formula_58. Therefore, with the exception of formula_59, the factors in the expanded form of formula_60 can be arranged in disjoint pairs such that product of each pair is congruent to 1 modulo formula_51. This proves Wilson&#x27;s theorem.

For example, for formula_62, one has
formula_63

====Proof using Fermat&#x27;s little theorem====

Again, the result is trivial for &quot;p&quot; = 2, so suppose &quot;p&quot; is an odd prime, . Consider the polynomial

:formula_64

&quot;g&quot; has degree , leading term , and constant term . Its roots are 1, 2, ..., .

Now consider

:formula_65

&quot;h&quot; also has degree and leading term . Modulo &quot;p&quot;, Fermat&#x27;s little theorem says it also has the same roots, 1, 2, ..., .

Finally, consider
:formula_66

&quot;f&quot; has degree at most &quot;p&quot; − 2 (since the leading terms cancel), and modulo &quot;p&quot; also has the roots 1, 2, ..., . But Lagrange&#x27;s theorem says it cannot have more than &quot;p&quot; − 2 roots. Therefore, &quot;f&quot; must be identically zero (mod &quot;p&quot;), so its constant term is . This is Wilson&#x27;s theorem.

====Proof using the Sylow theorems====

It is possible to deduce Wilson&#x27;s theorem from a particular application of the Sylow theorems. Let &quot;p&quot; be a prime. It is immediate to deduce that the symmetric group formula_67 has exactly formula_68 elements of order &quot;p&quot;, namely the &quot;p&quot;-cycles formula_69. On the other hand, each Sylow &quot;p&quot;-subgroup in formula_67 is a copy of formula_69. Hence it follows that the number of Sylow &quot;p&quot;-subgroups is formula_72. The third Sylow theorem implies
:formula_73
Multiplying both sides by gives
:formula_74
that is, the result.

==Applications==

===Primality tests===
In practice, Wilson&#x27;s theorem is useless as a primality test because computing (&quot;n&quot; − 1)! modulo &quot;n&quot; for large &quot;n&quot; is computationally complex, and much faster primality tests are known (indeed, even trial division is considerably more efficient).

Used in the other direction, to determine the primality of the successors of large factorials, it is indeed a very fast and effective method. This is of limited utility, however.

===Quadratic residues===
Using Wilson&#x27;s Theorem, for any odd prime , we can rearrange the left hand side of
formula_75
to obtain the equality
formula_76
This becomes
formula_77
or
formula_78
We can use this fact to prove part of a famous result: for any prime &quot;p&quot; such that &quot;p&quot; ≡ 1 (mod 4), the number (−1) is a square (quadratic residue) mod &quot;p&quot;. For this, suppose &quot;p&quot; = 4&quot;k&quot; + 1 for some integer &quot;k&quot;. Then we can take &quot;m&quot; = 2&quot;k&quot; above, and we conclude that (&quot;m&quot;!)2 is congruent to (−1) (mod &quot;p&quot;).

===Formulas for primes===
Wilson&#x27;s theorem has been used to construct formulas for primes, but they are too slow to have practical value.

===p-adic gamma function===
Wilson&#x27;s theorem allows one to define the p-adic gamma function.

==Gauss&#x27;s generalization==
Gauss proved that
formula_79

<doc id="227328" wikidata="Q879869" url="?curid=227328" title="Said bin Taimur">
<text>Said bin Taimur (; 13 August 1910 – 19 October 1972) was the 13th Sultan of Muscat and Oman from 10 February 1932 until he was deposed on 23 July 1970 by his son Qaboos bin Said.

He was a member of the House of Al Said who in 1932 became the Sultan of Muscat and Oman, succeeding his father Taimur bin Feisal who had abdicated for financial reasons. The 21-year-old Said inherited an administration that was in debt. He consolidated power, with the help of the British, and regained control of the tribal interior, bringing together Muscat and Oman. Once the country was united, Said left the capital of Muscat and resided in a coastal town in Dhofar. Muscat and Oman became fully sovereign and independent states in 1951 with him as ruler.

==Early life and education==
Said was born in 1910. He attended Mayo College at Ajmer in Rajputana, India, from 1922–1927 where he mastered English and Urdu. Upon his return to Muscat in May 1927, it was suggested he attend Beirut to further his education. His father, Sultan Taimur bin Feisal, feared that by sending him to Beirut, he would be influenced by Christianity.

Said’s father was strongly against him learning the ways of the Western world and speaking English. When Said was younger, his father found Sa’id and his brother Nadir possessing an English primer, and he ordered all their books be burned. Instead of sending Said to Beirut, his father sent him to Baghdad to study Arabic literature and history for a year.

== Early political career ==
After completing his year-long study in Baghdad, Said participated in the Omani government upon his return home. He became the president of the Council of Ministers in August 1929. Sultan Said&#x27;s inability to govern the state affairs of Oman created an opportunity for a new leader. The British were very fond of Said and during February 1932, at the age of 21, Said became the new crowned Sultan. Sultan Said inherited a country that was heavily in debt to Britain and British India. In order to break away from Britain and maintain autonomy, his country needed to regain economic independence. Therefore, beginning in 1933, he controlled the budget of the state until being overthrown in 1970.

== Marriages and children ==
In 1933, Said married his first wife, Fatima bint Ali Al Mashani, and later divorced.
* Sayyida Umaima bint Said bin Taimur Al Said

In 1936, Said married his second wife, Mazoon bint Ahmad Al Mashani, who was a cousin of his first wife.
* Sultan Qaboos bin Said bin Taimur Al Said (born 18 November 1940)

He also had a daughter by a slave concubine.
* Sayyida Khadija bint Said bin Taimur Al Said

== Reign ==

=== Accession ===
On his accession, he inherited the remains of the Omani Empire, which included the neighbouring provinces of Oman and Dhofar, as well as the last remnants of an overseas empire, including Gwadar in the Arabian Sea. Nevertheless, his petroleum-rich country also had long established ties with the United Kingdom, based on a 1798 Treaty of Friendship, and had been a British protectorate since 1891. He also inherited an administration that was in debt.

=== Foreign affairs ===
Once he became Sultan, Said maintained a friendly relationship with the United States. In 1938, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt invited Said and his father to visit the United States. Said landed in San Francisco and began a tour from California to Washington, D.C. During his visit to the White House, Roosevelt presented him with two books he had written. Said toured the FBI Headquarters, and laid a wreath upon George Washington’s tomb, at Mount Vernon.

During World War II, the Sultan cooperated readily with the British; several Royal Air Force landing fields were constructed between Salalah in Dhofar and Mascat. This allowed the channels of supply to remain open between Britain and the Allies.

=== Leadership ===
Oil wealth would have allowed Said to modernize his country. He secured British recognition of its independence in 1951. Nevertheless, he also faced serious internal opposition, from Imam Ghalib bin Ali, a religious leader of Oman, who claimed power in the sultanate for himself. The Imam&#x27;s revolt in Jebel Akhdar was suppressed in 1955, with British help, but this in turn earned Said the animosity of Saudi Arabia, which supported the Imam, and of Egypt, which regarded British involvement in suppressing the revolt as not conducive to the cause of Arab nationalism. In 1957, these two countries supported a renewed revolt by the Imam, which was similarly suppressed by 1959.

In 1958 Said sold Gwadar to Pakistan for $1 million, while in 1967 Britain returned the Khuriya Muriya Islands.

Said became more reclusive from his people and country. In 1965, after making concessions to export oil with Iraq, Iran and Britain, he did little to improve the life of his people. The benefits of this deal would not come to fruition until his was deposed in 1970 in a palace coup. 

In 1965, the province of Dhofar revolted, this time with the support of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and some of the nationalist Arab states, followed by an assassination attempt in 1966. It had a marked effect on Said, causing him to become even more erratic in governing the country. It was forbidden to smoke in public, to play football, to wear sunglasses or to speak to anyone for more than 15 minutes. No one was safe from the sultan&#x27;s paranoia, not even his own son, Qaboos, who was kept under virtual house arrest at Al Hosn Palace in Salalah.

Before he was overthrown in 1970, because of his backwards policies, Oman had an under 5 mortality rate of around 25%. Trachoma, venereal disease and malnutrition were widespread. There were only three schools, the literacy rate was 5%, and there were only of paved roads.

== Deposition ==

Qaboos returned from his educational studies in the United Kingdom at the Royal Military Academy, and a year of service in the British Army infantry in 1964, and was placed under house arrest. Said did not speak to his son during the last 14 months before the coup, even though they lived in the same palace.

On 23 July 1970 at the Sultan’s palace in Salalah, Qaboos executed a successful coup against his father with the help of the British and his uncle, and exiled his father to the United Kingdom. Said lived his last two years at the Dorchester Hotel in London. He was originally buried in Brookwood Cemetery, Woking, Surrey, England. His remains were then disinterred and transported back to Oman, and he was buried in the royal cemetery in Muscat.

<doc id="227331" wikidata="Q2716065" url="?curid=227331" title="Pudding Lane">
<text>Pudding Lane is a small street in London, widely known as the location of Thomas Farriner&#x27;s bakery, where the Great Fire of London started in 1666. It runs between Eastcheap and Thames Street in the historic City of London, and intersects Monument Street, the site of Christopher Wren&#x27;s Monument to the Great Fire. 

Farriner&#x27;s bakery stood immediately opposite the location of the present Monument, on the eastern side of Pudding Lane. The site was paved over when Monument Street was built in 1886–87, but is marked by a plaque on the wall of nearby Farynors House, placed there by the Bakers&#x27; Company in 1986.

Pudding Lane was given its name by the butchers of Eastcheap Market, who used it to transport &quot;pudding&quot; or offal down to the river to be taken away by waste barges. There was a wharf at its lower end called Rothersgate (from the &quot;&quot; or cattle that were landed there), and it was also known as Rother Lane. Another name for it was Red Rose Lane, from a shop sign that once hung in it.

Pudding Lane was one of the world&#x27;s first one-way streets. An order restricting cart traffic to one-way travel on Pudding Lane and 16 other lanes around Thames Street was issued in 1617, an idea not copied until Albemarle Street became a one-way street in 1800.

The nearest Underground station to Pudding Lane is Monument, a short distance to the west. The closest main-line railway stations are Fenchurch Street and Cannon Street.

==In popular culture==
Tom Canty, the protagonist of Mark Twain&#x27;s &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot;, lives on Pudding Lane.

Sara Addington write several children&#x27;s books referring to the lane:
*&quot;The Boy Who Lived in Pudding Lane.&quot; Illustrated by &quot;Gertrude Alice Kay.&quot; Boston: Atlantic Monthly Press, 1922.
*&quot;Pied Piper of Pudding Lane&quot;. Illustrated by Gertrude Alice Kay. Boston: Atlantic Monthly Press, 1923. 
*&quot;Round the Year in Pudding Lane.&quot; Illustrated by Gertrude Alice Kay. Boston: Little, Brown, and Company, 1924. 
*&quot;Pudding Lane People&quot;. Illustrated by Janet Laura Scott. Boston: Little, Brown, and Company, 1926. 

Pudding Lane and Farriner&#x27;s bakery feature prominently in the 2016 musical show &quot;Bumblescratch&quot;.

In the 1982 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;The Visitation&quot;, alien weapons intensify a fire that starts when the Doctor drops a torch in Pudding Lane, and spreads to become the Great Fire.

<text>Olivia Hussey (; 17 April 1951 – 27 December 2024) was a British actress. Her awards included a Golden Globe Award and a David di Donatello Award. The daughter of Argentine tango singer Osvaldo Ribó, Hussey was born in Buenos Aires but spent most of her early life in her mother&#x27;s native England. She aspired to become an actress at a young age and studied drama for five years at Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts in London.

Hussey began acting professionally as an adolescent. She appeared in a 1966 London production of &quot;The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie&quot;, opposite Vanessa Redgrave; this led to her being scouted for the role of Juliet in Franco Zeffirelli&#x27;s 1968 film adaptation of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. Hussey received widespread acclaim and international recognition for her performance. In 1974, she appeared as the lead character Jess Bradford in the cult slasher film &quot;Black Christmas&quot;. Hussey reunited with Zeffirelli in the miniseries &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; (1977) as Mary and appeared as Rosalie Otterbourne in John Guillermin&#x27;s Agatha Christie adaptation &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; (1978). 

She appeared in several international productions throughout the 1980s, including the Japanese production &quot;Virus&quot; (1980) and the Australian dystopian action film &quot;Turkey Shoot&quot; (1982). In 1990 she appeared in two horror productions, Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;It&quot; and &quot;Psycho IV: The Beginning&quot;, in which she portrayed Norman Bates&#x27; mother. She also worked as a voice actress, providing voice roles in &quot;Star Wars&quot; video games including &quot;Star Wars: Rogue Squadron&quot; (1998), &quot;Star Wars: Force Commander&quot; (2000), and &quot;Star Wars: The Old Republic&quot; (2011).

== Early life and education ==
Hussey was born Olivia Osuna on 17 April 1951 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, the first child of Argentine tango singer Andrés Osuna (stage name Osvaldo Ribó), and Joy Hussey, a legal secretary. Her mother was from England, of Scottish and English descent. Her parents were Roman Catholics, and she was raised in that denomination. Hussey recalled, &quot;I grew up with a mini-altar at home that she had; a candle was always alight on it. She always had a great love for God, and she instilled that in me.&quot; Hussey was fascinated by acting from a young age, and as a child, would dress up as a nun. 

At age seven, she moved with her mother and younger brother Andrew to London. There, Hussey was accepted into the Italia Conti Academy drama school, which she attended for five years, taking modeling and walk-on parts to help pay her fees. At 13, she began acting professionally on stage, assuming her mother&#x27;s maiden name as her stage name. In 1964, she appeared in an episode of the television series &quot;Drama&quot;, followed by minor roles in two films the following year: &quot;The Battle of the Villa Fiorita&quot; and &quot;Cup Fever&quot;.

==Career==
===&quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;===
Hussey appeared in a West End production of &quot;The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie&quot;, playing Jenny opposite Vanessa Redgrave. Italian film director Franco Zeffirelli noticed her performance because &quot;she was the only choice mature enough with experience and natural beauty to play Juliet while still looking 14.&quot; She was chosen out of 500 actresses to star in Zeffirelli&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; film, opposite 16-year-old Leonard Whiting&#x27;s Romeo. 

Derek Smith of &quot;Slant&quot; said Hussey&#x27;s performance &quot;captures the passion and yearning of love-struck teens in a very contemporary manner&quot;. Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; agreed, and said Hussey &quot;has an otherworldly purity&quot;. Roger Ebert also gave she and Whiting high praise. She won a special David di Donatello Award and the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actress in 1969. 

A memoir, &quot;The Girl on the Balcony: Olivia Hussey Finds Life After Romeo and Juliet&quot;, was published on 31 July 2018.

Nude scene controversy

In an August 2018 interview for Fox News to promote the release of her autobiography &quot;Girl on the Balcony&quot;, Hussey discussed filming the controversial nude scene in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;: &quot;We shot it at the end of the film. So by that time...we&#x27;ve become one big family. It wasn&#x27;t that big of a deal. And Leonard wasn&#x27;t shy at all! In the middle of shooting I just completely forgot I didn&#x27;t have clothes on.&quot; In another 2018 interview with &quot;Variety&quot;, Hussey defended the nude scene, saying, &quot;Nobody my age had done that before,&quot; adding that Zeffirelli shot it tastefully. &quot;It was needed for the film. Everyone thinks they were so young they didn&#x27;t realize what they were doing. But we were very aware. We both came from drama schools and when you work you take your work very seriously.&quot;

On 30 December 2022, Hussey and Whiting filed a $500 million lawsuit against Paramount Pictures for sexual exploitation, sexual harassment, and fraud, regarding the scene. In their court filing, the two actors stated that they had suffered emotional damage and mental anguish for decades. The complainants stated that director Franco Zeffirelli, who died in 2019, initially said they would wear flesh-coloured undergarments and be positioned in a way that would not show nudity, but that Whiting&#x27;s bare buttocks and Hussey&#x27;s bare breasts are nonetheless briefly shown during the scene, in violation of California state and federal laws against indecency and the exploitation of children. The case was dismissed in Los Angeles Superior Court on 25 May 2023.

===Subsequent screen roles and voice work===
After the success of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, Hollywood producer Hal B. Wallis offered her the title role in &quot;Anne of the Thousand Days&quot; (1969) and the co-starring role with John Wayne in &quot;True Grit&quot; (1969). In her 2018 memoir, Hussey recalled that she had &quot;mumbled something about being interested in &quot;Anne of the Thousand Days&quot;&quot; but that she &quot;couldn&#x27;t see herself with Wayne&quot;, concluding that this &quot;adolescent and opinionated&quot; remark ended her professional relationship with Wallis, who immediately withdrew his offer.

In 1971, Hussey appeared in the British drama &quot;All the Right Noises&quot;, followed by &quot;The Summertime Killer&quot; (1972), and the musical &quot;Lost Horizon&quot;. In 1974, Hussey played the lead role of Jess Bradford in the Canadian horror film &quot;Black Christmas&quot; (1974), which became influential as a forerunner of the slasher film genre of horror films. She played Mary, the mother of Jesus, in the 1977 television production of &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; (her second work for director Zeffirelli). In 1978, she played Rosalie Otterbourne in &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; with Peter Ustinov, and appeared in &quot;The Cat and the Canary&quot; (1979).She starred as Marit in the Japanese film &quot;Virus&quot; (1980), and played Rebecca of York in the 1982 remake of &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; (1982); the same year, she had a lead role in the Australian horror film &quot;Turkey Shoot&quot; (1982). In 1987, Hussey, along with several well-known actors, made a cameo appearance in a clip for the Michael Jackson video &quot;Liberian Girl&quot;.

In 1990, Hussey played Norma Bates, the mother of Norman Bates, in &quot;Psycho IV: The Beginning&quot;, a prequel to Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960), and appeared in the miniseries &quot;It&quot;, an adaptation of the Stephen King novel. These two roles along with &quot;Black Christmas&quot; earned her the label of scream queen.

Hussey played the lead in &quot;Mother Teresa of Calcutta&quot; (2003), a biographical film about Mother Teresa, for which she was presented with a Character &amp; Morality in Entertainment Award on 12 May 2007 in Hollywood. She stated in an interview that it had been her dream to portray the role of Mother Teresa of Calcutta ever since she finished her role as the Virgin Mary in &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot;. Hussey later reunited with Whiting as on-screen partners in the film &quot;Social Suicide&quot; (2015), the only film that they both appeared in since &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. In the project, Hussey&#x27;s daughter, actress India Eisley, played their fictional daughter, Julia Coulson.

Hussey also worked as a voice actress, and was nominated for &quot;Outstanding Individual Achievement for Voice Acting by a Female Performer in an Animated Television Production&quot; at the Annie Awards for her work in the DC Animated Universe as Talia al Ghul. She voiced the character of Kasan Moor in the PC/Nintendo 64 game, &quot;Star Wars: Rogue Squadron&quot; (1998) and was also in the massively multiplayer online role-playing game &quot;Star Wars: The Old Republic&quot; (2011) as Jedi Master Yuon Par. She also lent her voice to &quot;Star Wars: Force Commander&quot; in 2000. 

Hussey was slated to reprise her role as Jess Bradford in the &quot;Black Christmas&quot; fan film &quot;It&#x27;s Me, Billy: Chapter 2&quot;, but withdrew from the project in November 2023 due to health reasons.

== Personal life ==
Hussey had agoraphobia, which was aggravated by the fame she achieved after &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. 

She briefly dated Leonard Whiting in 1968. They remained friends throughout her life, reportedly communicating &quot;at least once every 10 days.&quot;

Hussey also dated actor Christopher Jones in 1968 but ended the relationship due to him being abusive towards her. The following year, Jones allegedly attacked, raped, and impregnated Hussey, who underwent an abortion.

In 1971, Hussey married Dean Paul Martin, the son of Dean Martin. They had one son, writer and actor Alexander Gunther Martin (born 1973). They divorced in 1978 but remained friends. Martin died in 1987 when the National Guard F-4 Phantom jet fighter he was piloting crashed.

From 1980 to 1989, Hussey was married to Japanese singer Akira Fuse. They had one son, Maximillian Hussey Fuse (born 1983). 

In 1991, she married American musician David Glen Eisley, the son of actor Anthony Eisley. They had one daughter, actress India Eisley.

== Illness and death ==
Hussey was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008, and underwent a double mastectomy. After being in remission for nearly a decade, the breast cancer returned in 2017, with Hussey undergoing chemotherapy and radiation treatment to remove a small tumour growing between her heart and lungs.

Hussey died at her home in Los Angeles on 27 December 2024, at the age of 73, following a recurrence of breast cancer. Later that day, Whiting released a statement: &quot;Rest now my beautiful Juliet no injustices can hurt you now. And the world will remember your beauty inside and out forever&quot;.

<text>Südwestpfalz (, ) is a district (&quot;Kreis&quot; or more precise &quot;Landkreis&quot;) in the south of Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from west clockwise) Saarpfalz, the district-free city Zweibrücken, the districts Kaiserslautern and Bad Dürkheim, the district-free city Landau (the Taubensuhl/Fassendeich forest part of the city), Südliche Weinstraße, and the French &quot;département&quot; Bas-Rhin. The district-free city Pirmasens is surrounded by the district.

==History==
The district was created 18 February 1818 as the &quot;Landkommisariat Pirmasens&quot;. During the communal reforms of 1968-72, several changes were made to the district. In 1969, the neighboring district Bad Bergzabern was dissolved and some part of it was added, while other municipalities were incorporated into the city Pirmasens. In 1972, the district &quot;Landkreis Zweibrücken&quot; was dissolved and added into the district &quot;Landkreis Pirmasens&quot;, which on 1 January 1997 renamed itself to &quot;Südwestpfalz&quot;.

==Geography==
The district is located in the hills of the Palatinate, the Palatinate forest. The river Lauter has its spring near the city of Pirmasens.

==Coat of arms==
The three red bars on golden ground in the left half is the coat of arms of Hanau-Lichtenberg, while the lion in the right half is the lion of the Electorate of the Palatinate. These mark the two historic states which were located on the district&#x27;s area until the end of the 18th century.

<doc id="227341" wikidata="Q259601" url="?curid=227341" title="Graham Allen (politician)">
<text>Graham William Allen (born 11 January 1953) is a British Labour Party politician, who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Nottingham North from 1987 to 2017. He stood down at the 2017 general election.

==Early life==
Graham Allen was born in 1953 in Aspley, Nottingham. He is the cousin of SDP politician Rosie Barnes ().

He was educated at the local Robert Shaw Primary School and Forest Fields Grammar School in Forest Fields. He graduated from City of London Polytechnic, and received an MA from the University of Leeds.

He joined the Labour Party in 1971 whilst employed as a warehouse worker. He worked from 1978 to 1983 as a Research Officer for the Labour Party. In 1982 he was elected as a councillor in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, where he served until 1986. He was a local government officer at Greater London Council between 1983 and 1984, before working for the trade union movement, running the first political fund ballots, and then with the GMB until his election in 1987.

==Parliamentary career==
Allen was elected as the Labour MP for the Nottingham North constituency at the 1987 general election, gaining the seat from the Conservative&#x27;s Richard Ottaway with a majority of 1,665 votes. His majority at the 2010 general election was 8,138.

After helping to organise Tony Blair&#x27;s leadership campaign, Allen was given a series of shadow portfolios, including social security, transport and the environment. After the Labour Party came to power at the 1997 general election Allen became a government whip until after the 2001 general election, when he returned to the backbenches.

Allen was liberated by his move to the backbenches, which freed him to speak out publicly on the few elements of government policy he opposed. Allen took a stand against the Iraq War, and with his Constituency Agent Ian Murphy, he stood at the forefront of a successful campaign to recall Parliament in September 2002, attempting to organise an unofficial recall if the House would not formally sit.

Allen sat on a number of parliamentary select committees, and was the chair of the Political and Constitutional Reform Select Committee in the House of Commons from 2010 to 2015. He is also a member of the Speaker&#x27;s Committee on the Electoral Commission.

Allen is a patron of Humanists UK (formerly British Humanist Association) and has campaigned against faith schools in the United Kingdom. He is an honorary associate of the National Secular Society.

In 2011, he voted against the military intervention in Libya.

Allen announced he would stand down at the 2017 general election due to ill health.

===Democratic Reform===
Allen was a proponent of democratic reform and supported independent local government, some proportional representation and a fully elected House of Lords. He introduced a bill calling for a written constitution in the UK.

In 1995, he wrote &quot;Reinventing Democracy&quot; and in November 2002 he published &quot;The Last Prime Minister: Being Honest About the UK Presidency&quot;, claiming that the UK effectively had a presidency. He argued that the Prime Minister (or &#x27;President&#x27;, as he referred to the office throughout the book) should be directly and separately elected in order for a better separation of powers. This new arrangement, he argued, would be best spelled out &quot;in plain English&quot; in a written constitution. Allen argues that a codified constitution would institutionalise the informal powers that the British prime minister has obtained, subsequently creating a system of checks and balances that act to limit the power of the prime minister.

Allen expanded on this in 2019, when he launched plans for a Citizens Convention on UK Democracy with cross-party support from MPs including Vince Cable, David Davis, Dominic Grieve, Caroline Lucas and Tom Watson. The convention aims to involve millions of people in a process of recommending changes to improve democracy including a review of the Parliamentary &quot;Second Chamber&quot;, the House of Lords, devolution and the regions, paying for politics, the voting system and a written constitution to enshrine in law things done by convention that do not currently exist in a statute.

The convention is planned to convene in 2020 and run through to the end of 2021.

===Early Intervention===

Allen was a strong advocate of early intervention in social issues. He wrote &quot;Early Intervention, good parents, great kids, better citizens&quot; with Iain Duncan Smith in 2009. He wrote two reports for the government on the topic in 2011.

===Constituency===
In October 2005, Allen became the first MP to chair a Local Strategic Partnership, which was subsequently renamed One Nottingham. Allen set it the mission of making Nottingham an &quot;Early Intervention City&quot;.

<doc id="227347" wikidata="Q332660" url="?curid=227347" title="Hilary Armstrong">
<text>Hilary Jane Armstrong, Baroness Armstrong of Hill Top, (born 30 November 1945), is a British Labour Party politician who was Member of Parliament (MP) for North West Durham from 1987 to 2010.

==Early life==
Armstrong was born on 30 November 1945 to Hannah P. Lamb and Ernest Armstrong, a Labour Party politician. She attended Monkwearmouth Grammar School before going on to take a BSc in sociology at West Ham Technical Institute (now the University of East London) and a Diploma in Social Work from the University of Birmingham. A former social worker and university lecturer, Armstrong worked for VSO in Kenya before entering politics. She was first elected as Durham County Councillor for Crook North Division in 1985.

She was shortlisted for the vacant Sedgefield constituency in 1983, only to lose out to Tony Blair, who went on to be elected MP. Four years later, at the 1987 general election, she was elected to her father&#x27;s North West Durham seat on his retirement, increasing his majority by 3,806 to 10,162.

==Parliamentary career==
Armstrong was parliamentary private secretary to John Smith during his time as Labour leader, and played a large part in his successful fight to institute One member, one vote at Labour&#x27;s party conference.

Armstrong was seen as a politician on the right of the Labour Party, and was close politically to her near neighbour Tony Blair and the New Labour agenda. However, she is also a member of the Amicus trades union (formerly MSF). Her union ties helped her gain support in rewriting Clause IV.

In the 1992 general election, Armstrong retained her North West Durham constituency by defeating two future party leaders, Theresa May of the Conservatives, who became Prime Minister in 2016, and Tim Farron of the Liberal Democrats.

===In government===
Armstrong spent two years as Minister for Housing and Planning and four years as Minister for Local Government in the Department for the Environment, Transport, and the Regions and then the Department for Transport, Local Government, and the Regions, before being promoted into the Cabinet of the United Kingdom as Chief Whip after the 2001 election. This was the high point of a political career which was low-key but generally successful; though she endured controversies over select committee membership and over allegations of strong arm tactics with Labour dissenters over military action in Afghanistan.

Armstrong also faced criticism after government defeats in the Commons over the length of time suspected terrorists could be detained without charge, and incitement to religious hatred provisions in the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005. Press commentators speculated that in losing these votes through miscalculating government support, and in one instance letting the Prime Minister off the &quot;Whip&quot; because she believed the vote was won, Armstrong&#x27;s position had become vulnerable. However the rumours that she would resign the post proved unfounded.

Afterwards, Conservative leader David Cameron mocked Armstrong during an exchange with Tony Blair, saying &quot;She must be the first Chief Whip in history to put the Prime Minister in the frame for losing a key vote—which is an interesting career move, to say the least.&quot; This was the second time David Cameron had attacked her during Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions; on his debut as Leader of the Opposition on 7 December 2005, Cameron singled her out by saying, &quot;That&#x27;s the problem with these exchanges—the chief whip on the Labour side shouting like a child. Is she finished? Are you finished?&quot;

On 5 May 2006 Armstrong was appointed Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Minister for the Cabinet Office and Minister for Social Exclusion. In 2006, Armstrong launched a petition on behalf of the Bethnal Green and Bow Labour Party against Labour turned Respect MP George Galloway&#x27;s participation in Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;. She criticised Galloway for being paid as an MP during the time he was in the Big Brother house. Galloway responded by saying he planned to refund the taxpayer after his exit from the show as he would not know how much to refund until then.

She formally resigned from the government on 27 June 2007 when Tony Blair resigned as Prime Minister, she was succeeded by Ed Miliband the following day. On becoming Prime Minister, Gordon Brown announced Armstrong&#x27;s appointment as Chair of a Parliamentary Labour Party Manifesto Committee drawing up policy ideas covering children. 

==Post-Government==
On 4 July 2009, Armstrong announced her intention to stand down at the 2010 general election.

On 18 June 2010, she was created a life peer as Baroness Armstrong of Hill Top, &quot;of Crook in the County of Durham&quot;, and was introduced in the House of Lords on 6 July 2010.

She was interviewed in 2014 as part of The History of Parliament&#x27;s oral history project.

She is a member of the Joint Committee on the Draft Domestic Abuse Bill.

On 19 July 2019, Armstrong&#x27;s North West Durham constituency party voted to expel her from the party after she and 67 other Labour peers published an advert in &quot;The Guardian&quot; on 17 July claiming that Jeremy Corbyn had “failed the test of leadership” over his handling of antisemitism complaints within Labour. However, the vote was non-binding as only the National Executive has the mandate to expel members. She is a member of Labour Friends of Israel.

==Personal life==
Armstrong is married to Paul Corrigan.

<doc id="227355" wikidata="Q4965111" url="?curid=227355" title="Brian Regan (comedian)">
<text>Brian Joseph Regan () (born June 2, 1958) is an American stand-up comedian who uses observational, sarcastic, and self-deprecating humor. He is known for incorporating body language and facial expressions into his act. His performances are often described as clean as he refrains from profanity as well as taboo subject matter. Regan&#x27;s material typically covers everyday events, such as shipping a package with UPS, mortgages, and visits to the optometrist. While he does not define himself as youth-oriented, Regan makes frequent references to childhood, including little league baseball, grade school spelling bees, and science projects.

Regan started out doing standup comedy in the 1980s and made his television debut on &quot;The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson&quot; in 1991. Regan subsequently released his first standup album, &quot;Brian Regan: Live&quot; in 1997 and has performed on various talk shows including &quot;The Dennis Miller Show&quot;, &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; and &quot;The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon&quot;. He has since gained acclaim among fans and comedians, selling out nationwide tours and continuing to release comedy albums. In 2014 he made his film debut making an appearance in Chris Rock&#x27;s comedy &quot;Top Five&quot; (2014). He starred in Peter Farrelly&#x27;s dark comedy series &quot;Loudermilk&quot; (2017–2020). He has appeared twice on Jerry Seinfeld&#x27;s show &quot;Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee&quot; and has released three Netflix comedy specials. In 2018, Regan&#x27;s sketch comedy series &quot;Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan&quot; which was produced by Seinfeld, was released on Netflix.

==Early life and education==
Born in Miami, Florida to a Catholic Irish-American family, Brian Regan was raised in Westchester, Florida. He has seven siblings, including brother Dennis Regan, who is also a stand-up comedian. He attended Christopher Columbus High School.

He attended Heidelberg College in Ohio, where he played wide receiver on the football team. Originally he had plans of being an accountant, but one of his football coaches saw his comic routines and encouraged him to consider theater and communications. During his last semester in 1980, Regan dropped out of school to pursue stand-up comedy. He finished his degree in 1997.

==Career==
In 1991, Regan made his first late night appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson&quot;. Regan continued standup comedy, releasing his first comedy album, &quot;Brian Regan Live&quot;, in 1997. In 2004, Regan self-released a DVD of his performance at the Irvine Improv, titled &quot;I Walked on the Moon.&quot; He was a featured comedian in a Comedy Central&#x27;s animated stand-up series &quot;Shorties Watchin&#x27; Shorties&quot;. In April 2007, Regan signed a deal with Comedy Central to star in two one-hour stand-up specials, release the specials on DVD, develop a show for the network, and headline a theater tour, &quot;Brian Regan in Concert: A Comedy Central Live Event,&quot; which began June 8, 2007.

Brian&#x27;s first one-hour special, &quot;Standing Up,&quot; debuted on Comedy Central on June 10, 2007. The special was recorded in April at The Barclay Theater in Irvine, CA, and a DVD of the performance was released August 14, 2007. His second Comedy Central special, entitled &quot;The Epitome of Hyperbole&quot;, premiered on September 6, 2008. A DVD of the performance was released September 9, 2008. His performance, &quot;All By Myself&quot;, is available via CD, exclusively on his website.

In 2012, Regan was the featured guest on Jerry Seinfeld&#x27;s web series &quot;Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee&quot;. He is also one of the few comedians to be featured on that show twice appearing in the 2018 episode: &quot;Are There Left Handed Spoons?&quot;. After seeing him perform standup in New Jersey, Chris Rock invited Regan to appear in his film &quot;Top Five&quot; (2014), which was his first film appearance.

In 2015, Regan made his 28th and final stand-up performance on &quot;The Late Show With David Letterman&quot;. On September 26, 2015, Regan recorded the first ever live special on Comedy Central, &quot;Brian Regan: Live from Radio City Music Hall&quot;. It was released as a video/audio album in Feb 2016.

In 2017, Regan was cast as Mugsy in Peter Farrelly&#x27;s dark comedy series &quot;Loudermilk&quot; starring Ron Livingston. The series has earned critical acclaim with a 92% on Rotten Tomatoes. Creator Farrelly praised Regan on his dark subversive performance in the show by saying, &quot;the performance [Regan] gives this year is the best performance on television this year&quot;. That same year, Regan signed a deal with Netflix and Jerry Seinfeld to release two stand-up specials, &quot;Nunchucks and Flamethrowers&quot; (2017), and &quot;Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan&quot; (2018). On February 23, 2021, Regan released a stand-up special, &quot;On the Rocks&quot;, on Netflix.

== Influences and acclaim ==
Regan cites Johnny Carson, Steve Martin, George Carlin, Richard Pryor, and David Letterman as influences on his comedy.

Regan has received acclaim among his comedy peers, including Jerry Seinfeld who has described him as &quot;one of my favorite, favorite stand-up comedians&quot;. Other comedians to have praised Regan include Norm Macdonald, Chris Rock, Jimmy Fallon, Patton Oswalt, David Letterman, and Bill Burr.

<doc id="227357" wikidata="Q650219" url="?curid=227357" title="Arthur Seyss-Inquart">
<text>Arthur Seyss-Inquart ( ; 22 July 1892 16 October 1946) was an Austrian Nazi politician who served as Chancellor of Austria in 1938 for two days before the &quot;Anschluss&quot;. His positions in Nazi Germany included deputy governor to Hans Frank in the General Government of Occupied Poland, and &quot;Reichskommissar&quot; for the German-occupied Netherlands. In the latter role, he shared responsibility for the deportation of Dutch Jews and the shooting of hostages.

During World War I, Seyss-Inquart fought for the Austro-Hungarian Army with distinction. After the war he became a successful lawyer, and went on to join the governments of Chancellors Engelbert Dollfuss and Kurt Schuschnigg. In 1938, Schuschnigg resigned in the face of a German invasion, and Seyss-Inquart was appointed his successor. The newly installed Nazis proceeded to transfer power to Germany, and Austria subsequently became the German province of Ostmark, with Seyss-Inquart as its governor (&quot;Reichsstatthalter&quot;).

During World War II, Seyss-Inquart served briefly as the Deputy Governor General in occupied Poland and, following the fall of the Low Countries in 1940, he was appointed &quot;Reichskommissar&quot; of the occupied Netherlands. He was a member of the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) and held the rank of SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot;. He instituted a reign of terror, with Dutch civilians subjected to forced labour and the vast majority of Dutch Jews deported and murdered.

At the Nuremberg trials, Seyss-Inquart was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity, sentenced to death, and executed by hanging.

== Early life ==
Seyss-Inquart was born in 1892 in Stannern (), a German-speaking village in the neighbourhood of the predominantly German-speaking town of Iglau (). This area constituted a German linguistic island in the midst of a Czech-speaking region; this may have contributed to the outspoken national consciousness of the family, and the young Arthur in particular. Iglau was an important town in Moravia, one of the Czech provinces of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, in which there was increasing rivalry between Germans and Czechs. His parents were the school principal Emil Zajtich (who changed his surname to Seyss-Inquart) and Augusta Hirenbach. His father was Czech and his mother was German.

The family moved to Vienna in 1907. Seyss-Inquart later studied law at the University of Vienna. At the beginning of World War I in August 1914 Seyss-Inquart enlisted with the Austrian Army and was given a commission with the Tyrolean &quot;Kaiserjäger&quot;, subsequently serving in Russia, Romania and Italy. He was decorated for bravery on a number of occasions, and while recovering from wounds in 1917, he completed his final examinations for his degree. Seyss-Inquart had five older siblings: Hedwig (born 1881), Richard (born 3 April 1883, became a Roman Catholic priest, but left the priesthood, married in a civil ceremony and became &quot;Oberregierungsrat&quot; [senior government counsel] and prison superior by 1940 in the Ostmark), Irene (born 1885), Henriette (born 1887) and Robert (born 1891).

In 1911, Seyss-Inquart met Gertrud Maschka. The couple married in December 1916 and had three children: Ingeborg Carolina Augusta Seyss-Inquart (born 18 September 1917), Richard Seyss-Inquart (born 22 August 1921) and Dorothea Seyss-Inquart (born 7 May 1928).

== Political career and the &quot;Anschluss&quot; ==
Seyss-Inquart went into law after the war and in 1921 set up his own practice. During the early years of the Austrian First Republic, he was close to the Fatherland Front. A successful lawyer, Seyss-Inquart was invited to join the cabinet of Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss in 1933. Following Dollfuss&#x27; murder in 1934, he became a State Councillor from 1937 under Kurt Schuschnigg. A keen mountaineer, Seyss-Inquart became the head of the German-Austrian Alpine Club. He later became a devotee of Heinrich Himmler&#x27;s concepts of racial purity and sponsored various expeditions to Tibet and other parts of Asia in hopes of proving Aryan racial concepts and theories. Seyss-Inquart was not initially a member of the Austrian National Socialist party, though he was sympathetic to many of their views and actions. By 1938, however, Seyss-Inquart knew which way the political wind was blowing and became a respectable frontman for the Austrian National Socialists.
In February 1938, Seyss-Inquart was appointed Austrian Minister of the Interior by Schuschnigg, after Hitler had threatened Schuschnigg with military actions against Austria in the event of non-compliance. On 11 March 1938, faced with a German invasion aimed at preventing a plebiscite on independence, Schuschnigg resigned as Austrian Chancellor. Under growing pressure from Berlin, President Wilhelm Miklas reluctantly appointed Seyss-Inquart his successor. On the next day, German troops crossed the border of Austria at the telegraphed invitation of Seyss-Inquart. This telegram had actually been drafted beforehand and was released after the troops had begun to march, so as to justify the action in the eyes of the international community. Before his triumphant entry into Vienna, Hitler had planned to leave Austria as a pro-Nazi puppet state headed by Seyss-Inquart. However, the acclamation for the German army from the majority of the Austrian population led Hitler to change course and opt for a full &quot;Anschluss&quot;, in which Austria was incorporated into Nazi Germany as the province of Ostmark. Only then, on 13 March 1938, did Seyss-Inquart join the Nazi Party.

== Head of Ostmark and Southern Poland ==
Seyss-Inquart drafted the legislative act reducing Austria to a province of Germany and signed it into law on 13 March. With Hitler&#x27;s approval, he became Governor (&quot;Reichsstatthalter&quot;) of the newly named Ostmark, thus becoming Hitler&#x27;s personal representative in Austria. Ernst Kaltenbrunner served as chief minister and Josef Burckel as Commissioner for the Reunion of Austria (concerned with the &quot;Jewish Question&quot;). Seyss-Inquart also received an honorary SS rank of Gruppenführer and in May 1939 he was made a &quot;Reichsminister&quot; without Portfolio in Hitler&#x27;s cabinet. Almost as soon as he took office, he ordered the confiscation of Jewish property and sent Jews to concentration camps. Late in his regime, he collaborated in the deportation of Jews from Austria.

Following the invasion of Poland, Seyss-Inquart was named as the Chief of Civil Administration for Southern Poland, but did not take up that post before the General Government was created, in which he became Deputy to the Governor General Hans Frank, remaining in this position until 18 May 1940. He fully supported the heavy-handed policies put into effect by Frank, including persecution of Jews. He was also aware of the &quot;Abwehr&quot;″s murder of Polish intellectuals.

==Reichskommissar in the Netherlands==
Following the capitulation of the Netherlands on 15 May 1940, Seyss-Inquart was appointed &quot;Reichskommissar&quot; for the Occupied Netherlands. He directed the civil administration, imposed complete economic subordination to Germany, and carried out Nazi policies. In April 1941, he was promoted to SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot;. Among the Dutch people he was mockingly referred to as &quot;Zes en een kwart&quot; (&quot;six and a quarter&quot;), a play on his name, and the fact that Seyss-Inquart suffered from a limp. He supported the Dutch NSB and allowed them to create the paramilitary Nederlandse Landwacht, which acted as an auxiliary police force. Other political parties were banned in late 1941 and many former government officials were imprisoned at Kamp Sint-Michielsgestel. The administration of the country was controlled by Seyss-Inquart himself and he answered directly to Hitler. He oversaw the politicisation of cultural groups from the Nederlandsche Kultuurkamer &quot;right down to the chessplayers&#x27; club&quot;, and set up a number of other politicised associations.

He introduced measures to combat resistance, and when there was a widespread strike in Amsterdam, Arnhem and Hilversum in May 1943, special summary court-martial procedures were brought in, and a collective fine of 18 million guilders was imposed. During the occupation, Seyss-Inquart authorized about 800 executions, although some reports put the total at over 1,500. These included executions under the so-called &quot;Hostage Law&quot;, the killing of political prisoners who were close to being liberated, the Putten raid, and the reprisal executions of 117 Dutchmen for the attack on SS and Police Leader Hanns Albin Rauter. Although the majority of Seyss-Inquart&#x27;s powers were transferred to the military commander in the Netherlands and the Gestapo in July 1944, he remained a force to be reckoned with. It is thought he met with Haj Amin al-Husseini, an exiled leader of Palestinian Arabs, Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, somewhere in Germany in 1943.

There were three concentration camps in the Netherlands: the smaller KZ Herzogenbusch near Vught, Kamp Amersfoort near Amersfoort, and Westerbork transit camp (a &quot;Jewish assembly camp&quot;); there were a number of other camps variously controlled by the military, the police, the SS, or Seyss-Inquart&#x27;s administration. These included a &quot;voluntary labour recruitment&quot; camp at Ommen (Camp Erika). In total around 530,000 Dutch civilians were forced to work for the Germans, of whom 250,000 were sent to factories in Germany. There was an unsuccessful attempt by Seyss-Inquart to send only workers aged 21 to 23 to Germany, and he refused demands in 1944 for a further 250,000 Dutch workers and in that year sent only 12,000 people.

Seyss-Inquart was an unwavering anti-Semite; within a few months of his arrival in the Netherlands, he took measures to remove Jews from the government, the press and leading positions in industry. Anti-Jewish measures intensified after 1941: approximately 140,000 Jews were registered, a &quot;ghetto&quot; was created in Amsterdam and a transit camp was set up at Westerbork. In February 1941, 600 Jews were sent to Buchenwald, a concentration camp located within Germany&#x27;s borders, and to Mauthausen, located in Upper Austria. Later, the Dutch Jews were sent to Auschwitz, the notorious complex operated by Nazi Germany in occupied Poland. As Allied forces approached in September 1944, the remaining Jews at Westerbork were removed to Theresienstadt, the SS-established concentration camp/ghetto in the Nazi German-occupied region of Czechoslovakia. Of the 140,000 registered, only 30,000 Dutch Jews survived the war.

When the Allies advanced into the Netherlands in late 1944, the Nazi regime had attempted to enact a scorched earth policy, and some docks and harbours were destroyed. Seyss-Inquart, however, was in agreement with Armaments Minister Albert Speer over the futility of such actions, and with the open connivance of many military commanders, they greatly limited the implementation of the scorched-earth orders. 

At the very end of the Dutch &quot;hunger winter&quot; in April 1945, Seyss-Inquart was with difficulty persuaded by the Allies to allow airplanes to drop food for the starving Dutch civilians of the occupied north-west of the country. Although he knew the war was lost, Seyss-Inquart did not want to surrender.

Before Hitler committed suicide in April 1945, he named a new government headed by Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz in his last will and testament, in which Seyss-Inquart replaced Joachim von Ribbentrop, who had long since fallen out of favour, as Foreign Minister. It was a token of the high regard Hitler felt for his Austrian comrade, at a time when he was rapidly disowning or being abandoned by so many of his other key lieutenants. Unsurprisingly, at such a late stage in the war, Seyss-Inquart failed to achieve anything in his new office.

He remained in his posts until 5 May 1945, when, after a meeting with Dönitz to confirm his rescission of the scorched earth orders, he was arrested on the Elbe Bridge in Hamburg by two soldiers of the Royal Welch Fusiliers, one of whom was Norman Miller (birth name: Norbert Mueller), a German Jew from Nuremberg who had escaped to Britain at the age of 15 on a &quot;Kindertransport&quot;. The Anglo-Dutch art dealer Edward Speelman was also involved in Seyss-Inquart&#x27;s arrest.

== Nuremberg trials ==

At the Nuremberg trials, Seyss-Inquart was defended by Gustav Steinbauer and faced four charges: conspiracy to commit crimes against peace; planning, initiating and waging wars of aggression; war crimes; and crimes against humanity.

During the trial, Gustave Gilbert, an American army psychologist, was allowed to examine the Nazi leaders who were tried at Nuremberg for war crimes. Among other tests, a German version of the Wechsler-Bellevue IQ test was administered. Arthur Seyss-Inquart scored 141, the second highest among the defendants, behind Hjalmar Schacht.

In his final statement, Seyss-Inquart denied knowledge of various war crimes including the shooting of hostages, and said that while he had moral objections to the deportation of Jews, there must sometimes be justifications for mass evacuations, and pointed to the Allies forcibly resettling millions of Germans after the war. He added that his &quot;conscience was untroubled&quot; as he improved the conditions of the Dutch people while Commissioner. Seyss-Inquart concluded by saying, &quot;My last word is the principle by which I have always acted and to which I will adhere to my last breath: I believe in Germany.&quot;

Seyss-Inquart was acquitted of conspiracy, but convicted on all other counts and sentenced to death by hanging. The final judgment against him cited his involvement in harsh suppression of Nazi opponents and atrocities against the Jews during all his billets, but particularly stressed his reign of terror in the Netherlands. It was these atrocities that sent him to the gallows.

Upon hearing of his death sentence, Seyss-Inquart was fatalistic: &quot;Death by hanging... well, in view of the whole situation, I never expected anything different. It&#x27;s all right.&quot;

Before his execution, Seyss-Inquart returned to the Catholic Church, receiving absolution in the sacrament of confession from prison chaplain Father Bruno Spitzl.

Seyss-Inquart was hanged in Nuremberg Prison on 16 October 1946, at the age of 54, together with nine other Nuremberg defendants. He was the last to mount the scaffold, and his last words were the following: &quot;I hope that this execution is the last act of the tragedy of the Second World War and that the lesson taken from this world war will be that peace and understanding should exist between peoples. I believe in Germany.&quot;

His body, with those of the other nine executed men and that of Hermann Göring (who had committed suicide the previous day), was cremated at the Ostfriedhof in Munich, and their ashes were scattered into the River Isar.

==Cultural references==
In Doris Orgel&#x27;s children&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Devil in Vienna&quot;, the narrator refers to Seyss-Inquart’s rise as she observes the changing political atmosphere in her Vienna. In Otto Preminger&#x27;s movie &quot;The Cardinal&quot;, Seyss-Inquart is played by Erik Frey.

In the Manga Hellsing (and its anime adaptation Hellsing Ultimate) the Major names one of his Zeppelins for Seyss-Inquart.

<text>Succession planning is a process and strategy for replacement planning or passing on leadership roles. It is used to identify and develop new, potential leaders who can move into leadership roles when they become vacant. Succession planning in dictatorships, monarchies, politics, and international relations is used to ensure continuity and prevention of power struggle. Within monarchies succession is settled by the order of succession. In business, succession planning entails developing internal people with managing or leadership potential to fill key hierarchical positions in the company. It is a process of identifying critical roles in a company and the core skills associated with those roles, and then identifying possible internal candidates to assume those roles when they become vacant. Succession planning also applies to small and family businesses (including farms and agriculture) where it is the process used to transition the ownership and management of a business to the next generation.

==Business succession planning==
Effective succession or talent-pool management concerns itself with building a series of feeder groups up and down the entire leadership pipeline or progression. In contrast, replacement planning is focused narrowly on identifying specific back-up candidates for given senior management positions. Thought should be given to the retention of key employees, and the consequences that the departure of key employees may have on the business.

The practice of business succession planning is conducted either by organisations themselves, or with the support of specialist Management consulting firms.

Fundamental to the succession-management process is an underlying philosophy that argues that top talent in the corporation must be managed for the greater good of the enterprise. Merck and other companies argue that a &quot;talent mindset&quot; must be part of the leadership culture for these practices to be effective.

Organizations use succession planning as a process to ensure that employees are recruited and developed to fill each key role within the company. Through one&#x27;s succession-planning process, one recruits superior employees, develops their knowledge, skills, and abilities, and prepares them for advancement or promotion into ever more-challenging roles.
Actively pursuing succession planning ensures that employees are constantly developed to fill each needed role. As one&#x27;s organization expands, loses key employees, provides promotional opportunities, or increases sales, one&#x27;s succession planning aims to ensure that one has employees on hand ready and waiting to fill new roles. Succession planning is one of important processes in leadership pipeline.

According to a 2006 Canadian Federation of Independent Business survey, slightly more than one third of owners of independent businesses plan to exit their business within the next 5 years - and within the next 10 years two-thirds of owners plan to exit their business. The survey also found that Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are not adequately prepared for their business succession: only 10% of owners have a formal, written succession plan; 38% have an informal, unwritten plan; and the remaining 52% do not have any succession plan at all. A 2004 CIBC survey suggests that succession planning is increasingly becoming a critical issue. The CIBC estimated that by 2010, $1.2 trillion in business assets would be poised to change hands.

Research indicates many succession-planning initiatives fall short of their intent. &quot;Bench strength&quot;, as it is commonly called, remains a stubborn problem in many if not most companies. Studies indicate that companies that report the greatest gains from succession planning feature high ownership by the CEO and high degrees of engagement among the larger leadership team.

Companies well known for their succession planning and executive-talent development practices include: General Electric, Honeywell, IBM, Marriott, Microsoft, Pepsi and Procter &amp; Gamble.

Research indicates that clear objectives are critical to establishing effective succession planning. These objectives tend to be core to many or most companies that have well-established practices:
* Identify those with the potential to assume greater responsibility in the organization
* Provide critical development experiences to those that can move into key roles
* Engage the leadership in supporting the development of high-potential leaders
* Build a database that can be used to make better staffing decisions for key jobs

In other companies these additional objectives may be embedded in the succession process:
* Improve employee commitment and retention
* Meet the career development expectations of existing employees
* Counter the increasing difficulty and costs of recruiting employees externally

===Process and practices===
Companies devise elaborate models to characterize their succession and development practices. Most reflect a cyclical series of activities that include these fundamentals:
* Identify key roles for succession or replacement planning
* Define the competencies and motivational profile required to undertake those roles
* Assess people against these criteria - with a future orientation
* Identify pools of talent that could potentially fill and perform highly in key roles
* Develop employees to be ready for advancement into key roles - primarily through the right set of experiences.

In many companies, over the past several years, the emphasis has shifted from planning job assignments to development, with much greater focus on managing key experiences that are critical to growing global-business leaders. North American companies tend to be more active in this regard, followed by European and Latin American countries.

PepsiCo, IBM and Nike provide current examples of the so-called &quot;game-planning&quot; approach to succession and talent management. In these and other companies annual reviews are supplemented with an ongoing series of discussions among senior leaders about who is ready to assume larger roles. Vacancies are anticipated and slates of names are prepared based on highest potential and readiness for job moves. Organization realignments are viewed as critical windows-of-opportunity to utilize development moves that will serve the greater good of the enterprise.

Assessment is a key practice in effective succession-planning. There is no widely accepted formula for evaluating the future potential of leaders, but many tools and approaches continue to be used today, ranging from personality and cognitive testing to team-based interviewing and simulations and other Assessment centre methods. Elliott Jaques and others have argued for the importance of focusing assessments narrowly on critical differentiators of future performance. Jaques developed a persuasive case for measuring candidates&#x27; ability to manage complexity, formulating a robust operational definition of business intelligence. The Cognitive Process Profile (CPP) psychometric is an example of a tool used in succession planning to measure candidates&#x27; ability to manage complexity according to Jaques&#x27; definition.

Companies struggle to find practices that are effective and practical. It is clear that leaders who rely on instinct and gut to make promotion decisions are often not effective. Research indicates that the most valid practices for assessment are those that involve multiple methods and especially multiple raters. &quot;Calibration meetings&quot; composed of senior leaders can be quite effective in judging a slate of potential senior leaders with the right tools and facilitation.

With organisations facing increasing complexity and uncertainty in their operating environments some suggest a move away from competence-based approaches. In a future that is increasingly hard to predict leaders will need to see opportunity in volatility, spot patterns in complexity, find creative solutions to problems, keep in mind long-term strategic goals for the organisation and wider society, and hold onto uncertainty until the optimum time to make a decision.

Professionals in the field, including academics, consultants and corporate practitioners, have many strongly-held views on the topic. Best practice is a slippery concept in this field. There are many thought-pieces on the subject that readers may find valuable, such as &quot;Debunking 10 Top Talent Management Myths&quot;, &quot;Talent Management Magazine&quot;, Doris Sims, December 2009. Research-based writing is more difficult to find. The Corporate Leadership Council, The Best Practice Institute (BPI) and the Center for Creative Leadership, as well as the Human Resources Planning Society, are sources of some effective research-based materials.

Over the years, organizations have changed their approach to succession planning. What used to be a rigid, confidential process of hand-picking executives to be company successors is now becoming a more fluid, transparent practice that identifies high-potential leaders and incorporates development programs preparing them for top positions. corporations consider succession planning a part of a holistic strategy called &quot;talent management&quot;. According to the company PEMCO, &quot;talent management is defined as the activities and processes throughout the employee life cycle: recruiting and hiring, Onboarding, training, professional development, performance management, workforce planning, leadership development, career development, cross-functional work assignments, succession planning, and the employee exit process&quot;. When managing internal talent, companies must &quot;know whether the right people, are moving at the right pace into the right jobs at the right time&quot;. An effective succession-planning strategy, coupled with solid career-development programs, will help paint a more promising future for employees.

===Succession management===
A substantial body of literature discusses succession planning. The first book that addressed the topic fully was &quot;Executive Continuity&quot; by Walter Mahler. Mahler was responsible in the 1970s for helping to shape the General Electric succession process which became the gold standard of corporate practice. Mahler, who was heavily influenced by Peter Drucker, wrote three other books on the subject of succession, all of which are out of print. His colleagues, Steve Drotter and Greg Kesler, as well as others, expanded on Mahler&#x27;s work in their writings. &quot;The Leadership Pipeline: How to Build the Leadership Powered Company&quot;, by Charan, Drotter and Noel is noteworthy. A new edited collection of materials, edited by Marshall Goldsmith, describes many contemporary examples in large companies.

Most large corporations assign a process owner for talent and succession management. Resourcing of the work varies widely - from numbers of highly dedicated internal consultants to limited professional support embedded in the roles of human-resources generalists. Often these staff resources are separate from external staffing or recruiting functions. some companies seek to integrate internal and external staffing. Others are more inclined to integrate succession management with the performance management process in order simplify the work for line managers.

===Succession advisors===
A prior preparation needs to be done for the replacement of a CEO in family firms. The role of advisors is important as they help with the transition of leadership between the current-generation leaders and the successors. Advisors help family-owned businesses establish their own leadership skills. This process is relatively long if the successors want to be accepted by all employees. They need to take higher managing positions gradually to be respected. During this process, the successors are asked to develop different skills such as leadership. This is where the role of advisors fully exemplifies its importance. It is when the managing position is shared between the first-generation leader, the second and the advisors. An advisor helps with communication because emotional factors between family members can badly affect the company. The advisors help manage everything during a predetermined period of time and make the succession process less painful and eventful for everybody. In these cases, an interim leadership is usually what is best for the company. The employees can get accustomed to changes while getting to know the future CEO.

==Business Exit Planning==
With the global proliferation of SMEs, issues of business succession and continuity have become increasingly common. When the owner of a business becomes incapacitated or passes away, it is often necessary to shut down an otherwise healthy business. Or in many instances, successors inherit a healthy business, which is forced into bankruptcy because of lack of available liquidity to pay inheritance taxes and other taxes. Proper planning helps avoid many of the problems associated with succession and transfer of ownership.

Business Exit Planning is a body of knowledge which began developing in the United States towards the end of the 20th century, and is now spreading globally. A Business Exit Planning exercise begins with the shareholder(s) of a company defining their objectives with respect to an eventual exit, and then executing their plan, as the following definition suggests:

Business Exit Planning is the process of explicitly defining exit-related objectives for the owner(s) of a business, followed by the design of a comprehensive strategy and road map that take into account all personal, business, financial, legal, and taxation aspects of achieving those objectives, usually in the context of planning the leadership succession and continuity of a business. Objectives may include maximizing (or setting a goal for) proceeds, minimizing risk, closing a Transaction quickly, or selecting an investor that will ensure that the business prospers. The strategy should also take into account contingencies such as illness or death.

All personal, financial, and business aspects should be taken into consideration. This is also a good time to plan an efficient transfer from the point of view of possibly applicable estate taxes, capital gains taxes, or other taxes.

Sale of a business is not the only form of exit. Forms of exit may also include initial public offering, management buyout, passing on the firm to next-of-kin, or even bankruptcy. Bringing on board financial strategic or financial partners may also be considered a form of exit, to the extent that it may help ensure succession and survival of the business.

In developed countries, the so-called &quot;baby boomer&quot; demographic wave is now reaching the stage where serious consideration needs to be given to exit. Hence, the importance of Business Exit Planning is expected to further increase in the coming years.

==Family business==
Small business succession tends to focus on how a business will continue to operate once its founder or initial leadership team retires or otherwise leaves the business. While small businesses on the whole often fail after the departure of their initial leadership team, succession planning can result in significantly improved chances for a business&#x27;s continuation.

Within the context of succession planning, where a small business is owned by a group of managers or partners, thought should be given to the transition of the business to the partners, how departure from a business will be managed, and how shares or ownership interest will be valued for purposes of sale or buy-out.

When succession occurs within a company&#x27;s hierarchy, succession plans should consider issues that may arise relating to retention of the intended successor, the possibility of jealousy by other employees, and how other employees will respond when they learn of the succession plan. Additional issues are likely to arise if succession is to a family member, particularly if more than one child of the managing owner works for the business or if siblings who do not work for the business will gain shares without having invested time and energy in the business.

Small businesses and perhaps especially family businesses benefit from creating a disciplined succession process, involving,
*Discussion and commitment by the shareholders;
*Careful candidate selection; and
*Integration and development of the selected successor.
No part of the process should be rushed, with the integration process being expected to take roughly two years.

<text>Kökar () is an island municipality to the south-east of the Åland archipelago, Finland.

It is also one of the municipalities of Åland. It is reachable by boat from Långnäs on Åland or from Galtby with access to mainland Finland.

The municipality has a population of () and covers an area of of which is water. The population density is .

The municipality is unilingually Swedish (with about %10 Finnish-speaking). 
The natural reserve of Östra Långskär is located there. Other notable islands include Kyrkogårdsö.

Ulla-Lena Lundberg, a Finnish author, was born in Kökar in 1947.

==History==
Kökar was first inhabited over 3,000 years ago by seal hunters. A Franciscan monastery was founded in Hamnö in the 15th century. Today the monastery is in ruins. The church dedicated to St. Anne was built in 1784 in the place of the old monastery church.

==Sights==
The church of St. Anne was built in the site of the old monastery church during the reign of king Gustav III and is located on the island of Hamnö. It is next to the ruins of the monastery. The belltower was built in the 19th century. The belltower had to be restored after an Autumn storm damaged it in 1978. A model of a sailing ship hangs in the church. It was given by a local sailor who had been captured by North African pirates but who later managed to escape. The model has 64 cannons.

The local museum was opened in 1988 and its purpose is to show how the people of Kökar lived in the 19th century and onwards to the 1940s. The now museum building, built in 1913, used to be an old school.

There is also a Bronze Age site dating back to 1150–1050 BC. It was found in 1918.

<doc id="227363" wikidata="Q1927682" url="?curid=227363" title="Parens patriae">
<text>Parens patriae is Latin for &quot;father of the nation&quot; (lit., &quot;father of one&#x27;s country&quot;). In law, it refers to the public policy power of the state to intervene against an abusive or negligent parent, legal guardian, or informal caretaker, and to act as the parent of any child, individual or animal who is in need of protection. For example, some children, incapacitated individuals, and disabled individuals lack parents who are able and willing to render adequate care, thus requiring state intervention.

In U.S. litigation, &quot;parens patriae&quot; can be invoked by the state to create its standing to sue; the state declares itself to be suing on behalf of its people. For example, the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976 (15 USC 15c), through Section 4C of the Clayton Act, permits state attorneys general to bring &quot;parens patriae&quot; suits on behalf of those injured by violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act.

==Discussion==
&quot;Parens patriae&quot; relates to a notion initially invoked by the King&#x27;s Bench in the sixteenth century in cases of &quot;non compos mentis&quot; adults. The notion dates from at least 1608, as recorded in Coke&#x27;s report of Calvin&#x27;s Case, wherein it is said &quot;that moral law, honora patrem… doubtless doth extend to him that is pater patriae.&quot;

The &quot;parens patrae&quot; doctrine was gradually applied to children throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and has since evolved from one granting absolute rights to the sovereign to one more associated with rights and obligations of the state and courts towards children and incapacitated adults.

In some situations, the parties may have submitted their dispute to formal arbitration proceedings. Such proceedings, whether judicial or quasi-judicial, cannot displace the supervisory power of the court in the exercise of its &quot;parens patriae&quot; function to the child. To the extent that such an award conflicts with the best interests of the child, the courts will treat it as void in respect of the child, even though it might be binding on the parents. The test of the best interests of the child can always be the basis of a challenge by a parent, grandparent, an interested relative, or the child acting through a friend.

Thus, for example, the spouses might already have been through a religious form of divorce known as the &quot;get&quot; before the &quot;Beth Din&quot;, the Jewish rabbinical court, which included provision for the children. Even though there might appear to be a grant of custody in absolute terms by this court, public policy always requires that it can be reviewed by a secular court and, if the state court is of the view that it is not in the best interests of the child, it will be set aside (see &quot;Stanley G. v. Eileen G.&quot; New York Law Journal, 10-13-94, P.22, Col.6, Sup. Ct., NY Co.).

Within the EU, the right of the child to be heard in any proceedings is a fundamental right provided in Article 24 Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The views of the child shall be considered on matters which concern them in accordance with their age and maturity. It also provides that the child&#x27;s best interest shall be the primary consideration in all actions relating to children, whether taken by public authorities or private institutions.

The same principles apply to individuals whose mental capacity is impaired and who are being abused by carers or other individuals, whether family members or otherwise. Since these individuals cannot protect themselves, the courts have an inherent jurisdiction to appoint a guardian &quot;ad litem&quot; for particular proceedings. In English Law, long-term care is arranged through the Court of Protection.

==In US federal courts==

The concept of the &quot;parens patriae&quot; suit has been greatly expanded in the United States federal courts beyond those that existed in England.

In &quot;Louisiana v. Texas&quot;, the State of Louisiana brought suit to enjoin officials of the State of Texas from so administering the Texas quarantine regulations as to prevent Louisiana merchants from sending goods into Texas. The US Supreme Court recognized that Louisiana was attempting to sue, not because of any particular injury to a particular business of the state, but as &quot;parens patriae&quot; for all its citizens. While the Court found that &quot;parens patriae&quot; could not properly be invoked in that case, the propriety and utility of &quot;parens patriae&quot; suits were clearly recognized, thus setting a precedent. Thus, in a series of cases after &quot;Louisiana v. Texas&quot; the Supreme Court followed that precedent to allow states to sue as &quot;parens patriae&quot;:

* &quot;Missouri v. Illinois&quot;, 180 U.S. 208 (1901) (holding that Missouri was permitted to sue Illinois and a Chicago sanitation district on behalf of Missouri citizens to enjoin the discharge of sewage into the Mississippi River);
* &quot;Kansas v. Colorado&quot;, 206 U.S. 46 (1907) (holding that Kansas was permitted to sue as &quot;parens patriae&quot; to enjoin the diversion of water from an interstate stream);
* &quot;Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Co.&quot;, 206 U.S. 230 (1907) (holding that Georgia was entitled to sue to enjoin fumes from a copper plant across the state border from injuring land in five Georgia counties);
* &quot;New York v. New Jersey&quot;, 256 U.S. 296 (1921) (holding that New York could sue to enjoin the discharge of sewage into the New York harbor);
* &quot;Pennsylvania v. West Virginia&quot;, 262 U.S. 553 (1923) (holding that Pennsylvania might sue to enjoin restraints on the commercial flow of natural gas);
* &quot;North Dakota v. Minnesota&quot;, 263 U.S. 365 (1923) (holding that Minnesota could sue to enjoin changes in drainage which increase the flow of water in an interstate stream).

The Supreme Court recognized a different kind of &quot;parens patriae&quot; suit in &quot;Georgia v. Pennsylvania R. Co.&quot; While the earlier cases were common-law actions to prevent or repair harm to a state&#x27;s &quot;quasi-sovereign&quot; interests. Georgia now sought relief under the federal antitrust statute, alleging that twenty railroads had conspired to restrain trade and to fix prices in a manner that would favor shippers in other states (particularly northern states) to the detriment of Georgia shippers and the state&#x27;s economy. The court upheld Georgia&#x27;s claim as &quot;parens patriae&quot; with respect to injunctive relief, but did not consider whether the antitrust laws also authorized damages for an injury to the state&#x27;s economy, because the ICC&#x27;s approval of the challenged rates barred any damage recovery.

Then, three decades later, in &quot;Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co.&quot;, the court considered a generally similar damages action Hawaii brought under the antitrust laws for damages to its general economy resulting from a price fix by four oil companies. The court held that the state could sue as &quot;parens patriae&quot; only for injunctive relief and not for damages. Its citizens would have to sue individually for damages.

In &quot;Massachusetts v. EPA&quot;, a group of states (mostly coastal states) sought to sue the EPA to require it to regulate greenhouse gas emissions because they were causing global warming and rising sea levels. &quot;These rising seas have already begun to swallow Massachusetts&#x27; coastal land.&quot; The court stated:

Therefore, states such as Massachusetts had standing as &quot;parens patriae&quot; to sue EPA to seeks to require it to regulate to protect their coastlines. The Court held that EPA would have to consider the matter and give a reasoned explanation of whatever its decision on the merits would be.

In &quot;Pennsylvania v. Mid-Atlantic Toyota Distributors, Inc.&quot;, the Fourth Circuit held that several state attorney generals were proper &quot;parens patriae&quot; plaintiffs to sue a group of car dealers for price fixing, in order to recover damages for their citizen injured by overcharges. The court held that because plaintiffs were authorized to pursue antitrust litigation against defendants on behalf of their states&#x27; natural-person residents under both 15 U.S.C. §§ 15c-15h and state laws and constitutions, they could sue on behalf of their citizens.

The relation of &quot;parens patriae&quot; suits brought under state law to the federal Class Action Fairness Act is an unclear issue with implications related to American federalism.

The United States Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Haaland v. Brackeen&quot; that states do not have the authority to sue the federal government under &quot;parens patriae&quot;.

== Animals ==
Supreme Court of India invoked the doctrine of parens patriae in &quot;Animal Welfare Board Of India vs A. Nagaraja &amp; Ors&quot;, the court observed, &quot;PCA Act (Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act), is a welfare legislation which has to be construed bearing in mind the purpose and object of the Act and the Directive Principles of State Policy. It is trite law that, in the matters of welfare legislation, the provisions of law should be liberally construed in favour of the weak and infirm. Court also should be vigilant to see that benefits conferred by such remedial and welfare legislation are not defeated by subtle devices. Court has also a duty under the doctrine of parens patriae to take care of the rights of animals, since they are unable to take care of themselves as against human beings.&quot;

<doc id="227381" wikidata="Q414537" url="?curid=227381" title="Nickel tetracarbonyl">
<text>Nickel carbonyl (IUPAC name: tetracarbonylnickel) is a nickel(0) organometallic compound with the formula Ni(CO)4. This colorless liquid is the principal carbonyl of nickel. It is an intermediate in the Mond process for producing very high-purity nickel and a reagent in organometallic chemistry, although the Mond Process has fallen out of common usage due to the health hazards in working with the compound. Nickel carbonyl is one of the most dangerous substances yet encountered in nickel chemistry due to its very high toxicity, compounded with high volatility and rapid skin absorption.

==Structure and bonding==
In nickel tetracarbonyl, the oxidation state for nickel is assigned as zero, because the Ni−C bonding electrons come from the C atom and are still assigned to C in the hypothetical ionic bond which determines the oxidation states. The formula conforms to the 18-electron rule. The molecule is tetrahedral, with four carbonyl (carbon monoxide) ligands. Electron diffraction studies have been performed on this molecule, and the Ni−C and C−O distances have been calculated to be 1.838(2) and 1.141(2) angstroms respectively.

==Preparation==
Ni(CO)4 was first synthesised in 1890 by Ludwig Mond by the direct reaction of nickel metal with carbon monoxide. This pioneering work foreshadowed the existence of many other metal carbonyl compounds, including those of vanadium, chromium, manganese, iron, and cobalt. It was also applied industrially to the purification of nickel by the end of the 19th century.

At , carbon monoxide is passed over impure nickel. The optimal rate occurs at 130 °C.

===Laboratory routes===
Ni(CO)4 is not readily available commercially. It is conveniently generated in the laboratory by carbonylation of commercially available bis(cyclooctadiene)nickel(0). It can also be prepared by reduction of ammoniacal solutions of nickel sulfate with sodium dithionite under an atmosphere of CO.

==Reactions==
===Thermal decarbonylation===
On moderate heating, Ni(CO)4 decomposes to carbon monoxide and nickel metal. Combined with the easy formation from CO and even very impure nickel, this decomposition is the basis for the Mond process for the purification of nickel or plating onto surfaces. Thermal decomposition commences near and increases at higher temperature.

===Reactions with nucleophiles and reducing agents===
Like other low-valent metal carbonyls, Ni(CO)4 is susceptible to attack by nucleophiles. Attack can occur at nickel center, resulting in displacement of CO ligands, or at CO. Thus, donor ligands such as triphenylphosphine react to give and . Bipyridine and related ligands behave similarly. The monosubstitution of nickel tetracarbonyl with other ligands can be used to determine the Tolman electronic parameter, a measure of the electron donating or withdrawing ability of a given ligand.

Treatment with hydroxides gives clusters such as and . These compounds can also be obtained by reduction of nickel carbonyl.

Thus, treatment of Ni(CO)4 with carbon nucleophiles (Nu−) results in acyl derivatives such as .

===Reactions with electrophiles and oxidizing agents===
Nickel carbonyl can be oxidized. Chlorine oxidizes nickel carbonyl into NiCl2, releasing CO gas. Other halogens behave analogously. This reaction provides a convenient method for precipitating the nickel portion of the toxic compound.

Reactions of Ni(CO)4 with alkyl and aryl halides often result in carbonylated organic products. Vinylic halides, such as PhCH=CHBr, are converted to the unsaturated esters upon treatment with Ni(CO)4 followed by sodium methoxide. Such reactions also probably proceed via oxidative addition. Allylic halides give the π-allylnickel compounds, such as :
==Toxicology and safety considerations==
The hazards of Ni(CO)4 are far greater than that implied by its CO content, reflecting the effects of the nickel if released in the body. Nickel carbonyl may be fatal if absorbed through the skin or more likely, inhaled due to its high volatility. Its LC50 for a 30-minute exposure has been estimated at 3 ppm, and the concentration that is immediately fatal to humans would be 30 ppm. Some subjects exposed to puffs up to 5 ppm described the odour as musty or sooty, but because the compound is so exceedingly toxic, its smell provides no reliable warning against a potentially fatal exposure.

The vapours of Ni(CO)4 can autoignite. The vapor decomposes quickly in air, with a half-life of about 40 seconds.

Nickel carbonyl poisoning is characterized by a two-stage illness. The first consists of headaches and chest pain lasting a few hours, usually followed by a short remission. The second phase is a chemical pneumonitis which starts after typically 16 hours with symptoms of cough, breathlessness and extreme fatigue. These reach greatest severity after four days, possibly resulting in death from cardiorespiratory or acute kidney injury. Convalescence is often extremely protracted, often complicated by exhaustion, depression and dyspnea on exertion. Permanent respiratory damage is unusual. The carcinogenicity of Ni(CO)4 is a matter of debate, but is presumed to be significant.

It is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Requiem for the Living&quot; (1978), an episode of &quot;Quincy, M.E.&quot;, features a poisoned, dying crime lord who asks Dr. Quincy to autopsy his still-living body. Quincy identifies the poison—nickel carbonyl.

In the 1979 novella &quot;Amanda Morgan&quot; by Gordon R. Dickson, the remaining inhabitants of a mostly evacuated village resist an occupying military force by directing the exhaust from a poorly-tuned internal combustion engine onto a continually renewed &quot;waste heap&quot; of powdered nickel outside a machine shop (under the guise of civilian business) in order to eliminate the occupiers, at the cost of their own lives.

In chapter 199 of the manga &quot;Dr. Stone&quot;, a machine is made that purifies nickel via the Mond Process. It is mentioned that the process creates a &quot;fatal toxin&quot; (nickel carbonyl).

In the 2019 novel &quot;Delta-v&quot; from &quot;New York Times&quot; bestselling author Daniel Suarez a team of eight private miners reach a near-earth asteroid to extract volatiles (water, CO2, etc.) and metals (iron, nickel and cobalt); these are stored as solid carbonyl for transfer back to near Earth orbit, and used for in-situ fabrication of a spacecraft, via decomposition in vacuum.

<text>Amiga Unix (informally known as Amix) is a discontinued full port of AT&amp;T Unix System V Release 4 operating system developed by Commodore-Amiga, Inc. in 1990 for the Amiga computer family as an alternative to AmigaOS, which shipped by default.

==Overview==
Bundled with the Amiga 3000UX, Commodore&#x27;s Unix was one of the first ports of SVR4 to the 68k architecture, and this level of compliance was emphasised in marketing materials such as the company&#x27;s &quot;Born To Run UNIX SVR4&quot; brochure. The Amiga 3000UX provided the OPEN LOOK graphical environment, with the machine reportedly featuring on the Sun Microsystems and Unix International stands at the 1991 Uniforum show, ostensibly as a consequence of Commodore&#x27;s adoption of these exhibitors&#x27; technologies. An earlier Amiga-based graphical Unix system had reportedly featured on the AT&amp;T booth at the Uniforum Fall &#x27;89 show.

Exhibited at CeBIT in early 1988, the Amiga 2500UX was described as a Motorola 68020-based system that could be booted to Unix System V Release 3 (SVR3) or AmigaDOS, supporting an X Window System interface, as well as a &quot;very fast and more flexible&quot; proprietary windowing system that was also to be offered. Graphics acceleration using the Amiga chipset was promised, along with an upgrade kit consisting of an expansion board featuring the 68020 and a memory management unit for existing users to upgrade to the Unix system. September 1988 availability was announced for the European market. Shortly afterwards, at COMDEX Spring 1988, Commodore demonstrated its proprietary windowing system on an Amiga 2000 system running Unix, also showing off a 68030 upgrade board.

The Amiga 2500UX was more comprehensively described in COMDEX Fall 1988 show coverage as a 14.3 MHz Motorola 68020-based system with 80 MB hard drive and 150 MB tape system, fitted with 5 MB of RAM and featuring the Motorola 68851 memory management unit and Motorola 68881 floating-point unit (FPU). The &quot;full implementation&quot; of Unix System V was to be offered with the machine. A premature report had emerged of a version of Unix running on the Amiga 2000 at a separate October 1988 event, due to an X Window System implementation for AmigaDOS having been mistaken for a graphical Unix system. As of early 1989, Amiga Unix or AMIX was a SVR3.1 implementation on the Amiga 2500UX, reported as featuring a &quot;proprietary windowing system&quot; that was &quot;specifically designed for speed and convenience&quot;. Developers had already reportedly received beta versions of the AMIX system, and system pricing was estimated at around $.

Commodore described the Amiga 2500UX with the same 68020-based specifications at the CeBIT show in early 1989, also indicating a £ price for the upgrade kit to bring the Amiga 2000 up to the capabilities of the 2500UX. In a May 1989 show in Toronto, Commodore had adjusted the specification of the 2500UX, making it a 68030-based machine running SVR3.3 and the &quot;Amix Windows multi-tasking user interface&quot;, even suggesting a price of CA$. By the end of 1989, the purpose of the 2500UX had become more apparent as a development machine, with Commodore UK suggesting that the eventual Unix product would be a 68030-based Amiga 3000 system running SVR4, available during 1990.

As the release of the Amiga 3000UX approached, the hardware requirements for Amiga 2000 systems running Unix were refined further, demanding an accelerator card such as the A2630, providing a 68030 CPU and 68882 FPU, bringing them into line with the A2500/30 variant of the Amiga 2500. More than 100 MB of hard drive storage and a tape drive for installing the operating system were required.

By the end of 1990, several months after the launch of the Amiga 3000, Commodore indicated plans to launch the 3000UX at the Uniforum show in January 1991, reportedly needing to finish off its SVR4 implementation and to attract software vendors to its platform. Finally, at Uniforum, two Amiga 3000UX configurations were unveiled, broadly confirming earlier reports. A reported 1,000 units had already been &quot;shipped to beta-test sites&quot; ahead of wider availability.

==Reception==

Although the Amiga 3000UX could deliver a &quot;responsive&quot; experience, performance in the graphical environment was nevertheless described as being &quot;on par with a slow 386 machine running SCO Open Desktop&quot;. Another evaluation of version 1.1 of the operating system described the X Window System performance as being &quot;monochrome and slow as molasses&quot;, with an improved version 2.0 of the system to be made available, providing colour support in conjunction with the A2410 graphics board. This board was launched later in 1991, offering a resolution with 8-bit colour depth, having been first announced in late 1988 as a collaboration with the University of Lowell. The card, based on the TMS34010, had previously been demonstrated at the Uniforum Fall &#x27;89 show.

The Amiga 3000UX&#x27;s base price of (approximately US$ today), rising to a reported $ with graphics board (priced separately at around $) and colour monitor, was not especially attractive compared to other Unix workstations at the time. By the end of 1989, around a year before availability of the Amiga 3000UX, vendors such as Hewlett-Packard and Sun had already launched 68030-based models aimed at the low-end of the market. HP had started 1989 by launching its low-cost HP 9000 Model 340 workstation range with prices starting from $. Later in the year, the Apollo DN2500, positioned as an entry-level workstation with monochrome display by HP&#x27;s Apollo division, cost only $ for a diskless model or $ with hard disk, eliminating the distinction between workstations and personal computers in pricing terms. The Sun 3/80 cost $ for a comparable entry-level product.

RISC-based competitors offering superior performance were also already available at similar price levels as competition increased, such as the DECstation 2100 (reduced to $), and numerous SPARC workstations were anticipated at this $ price point during 1990. Sun&#x27;s SPARCstation 1, introduced alongside the 3/80, had cost $ for the diskless version in 1989. By the end of 1991, models such as the Sun SPARCstation IPC would cost $ for a model similarly specified to the A3000UX in terms of memory, disk capacity and display, yet offer considerably better performance.

Commodore&#x27;s product marketing manager indicated that the machine was intended to compete with machines from NeXT and Apple&#x27;s A/UX, conceding, &quot;We really don&#x27;t see ourselves as being competitive with Sun.&quot; Advertising for the system focused on Apple and NeXT as competitors, emphasising its adoption of System V, OPEN LOOK and X Window System technologies. However, within a year of its launch, the Amiga 3000UX&#x27;s 68030 was already considered &quot;one whole generation behind&quot; the 68040-based NeXTstation, priced from $ with greyscale display, $ with colour display. Later entry-level workstations from established vendors upheld their aggressive pricing while increasing the performance gap. For example, the Personal DECstation 5000 Model 20 provided a newer CPU and was priced from only $ for a diskless configuration, with the faster Model 25 being available in a colour display configuration with hard disk for $.

Differences in the nature of Commodore&#x27;s channels between the US and European markets also prevented Commodore from exploiting opportunities to sell Amiga Unix systems. Attempts had been made to target &quot;untapped professional markets&quot; and position the Amiga as a more serious multimedia-capable machine, also satisfying the &quot;corporate checklist&quot; by offering Unix and networking capabilities. In the US market, specialist dealers played an important role in the sales effort and were considered more able to support sophisticated products based on Unix. However, European sales of the Amiga range were largely driven by high street retailers targeting a computer gaming demographic, and a shift in emphasis requiring the introduction of a capable sales and support infrastructure was perceived as being more costly than the potential earnings generated through Unix product sales. Moreover, an increasingly competitive European Unix market led to doubts that such sales would materialise, putting the European availability of Amiga Unix into question.

In an attempt to respond to the competitive situation, Commodore released version 2.1 of Amiga Unix in early 1992, reducing the price of an Amiga 3000UX system bundle featuring 9 MB of RAM, 200 MB hard drive, A2410 high-resolution graphics card, Ethernet card, and colour monitor (or SCSI tape drive) for a limited period to $, compared to a combined retail price of $. By this time, HP had already introduced 68040-based workstations at the low end of the market, such as the HP Apollo 9000 Model 425e, available from $ for an 8 MB, diskless model with 19-inch greyscale monitor. In early 1992, it was reported that Commodore had appointed solution provider Applied Systems Group as the sole UK reseller of Amiga Unix. Commodore maintained claims of the platform outperforming &quot;traditional vendors in its price bracket&quot;, also claiming to have converted numerous existing users of &quot;Sun 4, 486 and 68000-based workstations&quot; to the platform.

Unlike Apple&#x27;s A/UX compatibility layer for System 7 applications, Amiga Unix contains no compatibility layer for AmigaOS applications. Prior to the system&#x27;s release, Commodore had merely indicated that the company had been &quot;discussing&quot; such application support. Commodore&#x27;s UK marketing manager stated that user interface guidelines would be introduced to ensure consistency between traditional Amiga and Amiga Unix applications, with Amiga Unix offering a &quot;friendly Mac-like environment&quot;. With few native applications available to take advantage of the Amiga&#x27;s significant multimedia capabilities, it failed to find a niche in the competitive Unix workstation market of the early 1990s beyond certain targeted deployments. For instance, computer science students at Virginia Tech were obliged to purchase the Amiga 3000UX to pursue their studies, with students offered a base model providing 4 MB of RAM, a 100 MB hard disk, and colour monitor for around $.

Unlike typical commercial Unix distributions of the time, Amiga Unix included the source code to the vendor-specific enhancements and platform-dependent device drivers (essentially any part that wasn&#x27;t owned by AT&amp;T), allowing interested users to study or enhance those parts of the system. However this source code was subject to the same license terms as the binary part of the system it was not free software. Amiga Unix also incorporated and depended upon many open source components, such as the GNU C Compiler and X Window System, and included their source code.

Like many other proprietary Unix variants with small market shares, Amiga Unix vanished into the mists of computer history when its vendor, Commodore, went out of business. Today, Unix-like operating systems such as Minix, NetBSD, and Linux are available for the Amiga platform.

==Speculation==

Unsubstantiated rumours of the adoption of the Amiga 3000UX as a product by Sun Microsystems have been presented in various online venues, despite Sun already fielding a comprehensive workstation range and pursuing a technological direction that was leading the company away from Motorola&#x27;s 68000 family and towards Sun&#x27;s favoured SPARC architecture, describing demand for 68000 family systems as &quot;very, very low&quot;. One instance of coverage of such rumours that appeared in contemporary print media characterised such rumours as &quot;an amusing tidbit&quot; with the author presciently regarding the rumoured development as unlikely.

Other rumours supposedly persisted towards the beginning of 1990 that Hewlett-Packard had been &quot;negotiating to buy Commodore&quot;, only to pull out, eliciting later claims of HP workstations with &quot;suspiciously Amiga-like specifications&quot;. Such commentary was evidently oblivious to HP&#x27;s existing extensive workstation ranges, including Motorola-based systems, and its 1989 acquisition of Apollo Computer in pursuit of workstation market share and application support. Indeed, this acquisition led to a degree of duplication in HP&#x27;s Motorola-based product ranges in need of careful resolution, but brought with it numerous Apollo developers and customers. Such considerations and benefits would have been largely absent in any hypothetical Commodore acquisition.

<doc id="227400" wikidata="Q5157281" url="?curid=227400" title="Pathetic fallacy">
<text>The phrase pathetic fallacy is a literary term for the attribution of human emotion and conduct to things found in nature that are not human. It is a kind of personification that occurs in poetic descriptions, when, for example, clouds seem sullen, when leaves dance, or when rocks seem indifferent. The English cultural critic John Ruskin coined the term in the third volume of his work &quot;Modern Painters&quot; (1856).

==History of the phrase==
The meanings of the component terms have changed significantly since Ruskin&#x27;s coinage. Ruskin&#x27;s original definition is &quot;emotional falseness&quot;, or the falseness that occurs to one&#x27;s perceptions when influenced by violent or heightened emotion. For example, when a person is unhinged by grief, the clouds might seem darker than they are, or perhaps mournful or uncaring. The word &quot;fallacy&quot; in modern usage refers primarily to an example of flawed reasoning, but for Ruskin and writers of the 19th century and earlier, &quot;fallacy&quot; could be used to mean simply a &quot;falseness&quot;. Similarly, the word &quot;pathetic&quot; simply meant for Ruskin &quot;emotional&quot; or &quot;pertaining to emotion.&quot;

Ruskin coined the term &quot;pathetic fallacy&quot; to help explain his theory of the role of truth in art. For him, &quot;nothing [can] be good or useful, ... which [is] untrue.&quot; And yet, he notes, good poetry often includes &quot;falsehoods&quot; such as the ascription of emotion to inanimate objects. To resolve this apparent paradox, he posits that usages of pathetic fallacy succeed when the perceptual error in question is due to a heightened emotional state: &quot;so long as we see that the &quot;feeling&quot; is true, we pardon, or are even pleased by, the confessed fallacy.&quot; However, in his view, the greatest poets exercise extreme restraint in this regard. He praises the author of a French ballad: &quot;there is not, from beginning to end of it, a single poetical expression, except in one stanza. ... [I]n the very presence of death, for an instant, his own emotions conquer him. He records no longer the facts only, but the facts as they seem to him.&quot;

While Ruskin&#x27;s essay plainly praises and disparages use of the pathetic fallacy in various contexts, his phrase has been remembered as a &quot;pejorative&quot;, used to criticize the sentimentality that was common to the poetry of the late 18th century, especially among poets like Burns, Blake, Wordsworth, Shelley, and Keats. Wordsworth supported this use of personification based on emotion by claiming that &quot;objects ... derive their influence not from properties inherent in them ... but from such as are bestowed upon them by the minds of those who are conversant with or affected by these objects.&quot; However Tennyson, in his own poetry, began to refine and diminish such expressions, and introduced an emphasis on what might be called a more scientific comparison of objects in terms of sense perception. The old order was beginning to be replaced by the new just as Ruskin addressed the matter, and the use of the pathetic fallacy began markedly to disappear. As a critic, Ruskin proved influential and is credited with having helped to refine poetic expression.

==Examples==
Ruskin&#x27;s first example is these lines of a poem:

&lt;poem&gt;They rowed her in across the rolling foam—
The cruel, crawling foam . . .&lt;/poem&gt;

Ruskin then points out that &quot;the foam is not cruel, neither does it crawl. The state of mind which attributes to it these characters of a living creature is one in which the reason is unhinged by grief&quot;—these lines work for Ruskin &quot;not because they fallaciously describe foam, but because they faithfully describe sorrow.&quot;

The following, a stanza from the poem &quot;Maud&quot; (1855) by Alfred, Lord Tennyson, demonstrates what John Ruskin, in &quot;Modern Painters&quot;, said was an &quot;exquisite&quot; instance of the use of the pathetic fallacy:

&lt;poem&gt;
There has fallen a splendid tear
 From the passion-flower at the gate.
She is coming, my dove, my dear;
 She is coming, my life, my fate.
The red rose cries, &quot;She is near, she is near;&quot;
 And the white rose weeps, &quot;She is late;&quot;
The larkspur listens, &quot;I hear, I hear;&quot;
 And the lily whispers, &quot;I wait.&quot; (Part 1, &quot;XXII&quot;, 10)
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Science==
A pathetic fallacy such as &quot;Nature abhors a vacuum&quot; may help explain a scientific concept, though some caution against using pathetic fallacies in science writing for not being strictly accurate.

<text>The western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) is a North American freshwater poeciliid fish, also known commonly, if ambiguously, as simply mosquitofish or by its generic name, &quot;Gambusia&quot;, or by the common name gambezi. Its sister species, the eastern mosquitofish (&quot;Gambusia holbrooki&quot;) is also referred to by these names.

Mosquitofish are small in comparison to many other freshwater fish, with females reaching a maximum length of and males a maximum length of . The female can be distinguished from the male by her larger size and a gravid spot at the posterior of her abdomen. The name &quot;mosquitofish&quot; was given because the fish eats mosquito larvae, and has been used more than any other fishes for the biological control of mosquitoes. Gambusia typically eat zooplankton, beetles, mayflies, caddisflies, mites, and other invertebrates; mosquito larvae make up only a small portion of their diet.

Mosquitofish were introduced directly into ecosystems in many parts of the world as a biocontrol to lower mosquito populations which in turn negatively affected many other species in each distinct bioregion. Mosquitofish in Australia are classified as a noxious pest and may have exacerbated the mosquito problem in many areas by outcompeting native invertebrate predators of mosquito larvae. Several counties in California distribute mosquitofish at no charge to residents with human-made fish ponds and pools as part of their mosquito abatement programs. The fish are made available to residents only and are intended to be used solely on their own property, not introduced into natural habitat. On 24 February 2014, Chennai Corporation in India introduced western mosquitofish in 660 ponds to control the mosquito population in freshwater bodies.

Fertilization is internal; the male secretes milt into the genital aperture of the female through his gonopodium. Within 16 to 28 days after mating, the female gives birth to about 60 young. The males reach sexual maturity within 43 to 62 days. The females, if born early in the reproductive season, reach sexual maturity within 21 to 28 days; females born later in the season reach sexual maturity the next season, in six to seven months.

==Description==
Mosquitofish are small and of a dull grey coloring, with a large abdomen, and have rounded dorsal and caudal fins and an upturned mouth. Sexual dimorphism is seen; mature females reach a maximum overall length of , while males reach only . Sexual dimorphism is also seen in the physiological structures of the body. The anal fins on adult females resemble the dorsal fins, while the anal fins of adult males are pointed. This pointed fin, referred to as a gonopodium, is used to deposit milt inside the female. The gonopodium of &quot;G. affinis&quot; has a smooth third ray (the anteriormost elongated ray), while that of &quot;G. holbrooki&quot; bears minute denticles. Adult female mosquitofish can be identified by a gravid spot they possess on the posterior of their abdomens. Other species considered similar to &quot;G. affinis&quot; include &quot;Poecilia latipinna&quot;, &quot;Poecilia reticulata&quot;, and &quot;Xiphophorus maculatus&quot;; they are commonly misidentified as mosquitofish.

==Naming and taxonomy==
The mosquitofish is a member of the family Poeciliidae of order Cyprinodontiformes. The genus name &quot;Gambusia&quot; is derived from the Cuban Spanish term &quot;gambusino&quot;, meaning &quot;useless&quot;. The common name, mosquitofish, is derived from their use for biological control of mosquitoes, which itself was based on early observations that, in certain circumstances, they can reduce mosquito abundances. Classification of the western mosquitofish has been difficult due to their similarity to the eastern mosquitofish, and according to ITIS (Integrated Taxonomic Information System), &quot;G. holbrooki&quot; (eastern mosquitofish) may be an invalid taxonomic name, and could be considered a subspecies of &quot;G. affinis&quot;.

==Diet==

Mosquitofish are diet generalists, but they are considered &quot;larvivorous&quot; because they consume the larvae of mosquitoes and other aquatic insects. Their diet consists of zooplankton, small insects and insect larvae, and detritus material. Mosquitofish feed on mosquito larvae at all stages of life, if mosquito larvae are available in the environment. Adult females can consume up to hundreds of mosquito larvae in one day. Maximum consumption rate in a day by one mosquitofish has been observed to be from 42%–167% of its own body weight. However, they can suffer mortality if fed only mosquito larvae, and survivors of this diet show poor growth and maturation. As generalists, mosquitofish have also shown cannibalistic behavior on the young of their own species.

==Habitat==
The native range of the mosquitofish is from southern parts of Illinois and Indiana, throughout the Mississippi River and its tributary waters, to as far south as the Gulf Coast in the northeastern parts of Mexico. They are found most abundantly in shallow water protected from larger fish.
Mosquitofish can survive relatively inhospitable environments, and are resilient to low oxygen concentrations, high salt concentrations (up to twice that of sea water), and temperatures up to for short periods. Because of their notable adaptability to harsh conditions and their global introduction into many habitats for mosquito control, they have been described as the most widespread freshwater fish in the world. Some of their natural predators include the bass, catfish and bluegill.

==Global invasion history and environmental impact==

Mosquitofish were intentionally introduced in many areas with large mosquito populations to decrease the population of mosquitoes by eating the mosquito larvae. However, retrospectively, many introductions could be considered ill-advised; in most cases native fishes supplied control of mosquito populations, and introducing mosquitofish has been harmful to indigenous aquatic life. Mosquitofish introduction outside of their native range can also be harmful to ecosystems. Mosquitofish can consume or injure other small fish or otherwise harm them through competition. The ecological impacts of mosquitofish are partly dictated by their sex ratio, which can vary dramatically across their introduced range. Mosquitofish in Australia are considered noxious pests where they pose a threat to native fish and frog populations and little evidence indicates they have controlled mosquito populations or mosquito-borne diseases. They have been dubbed by scientists as &quot;one of the most problematic animals on the planet&quot;.

However, from the 1920s to the 1950s, mosquitofish were considered by some to be a significant factor in eradicating malaria in South America, southern Russia, and Ukraine. Mosquitofish bred by Joice Loch were distributed through Greece, Serbia and the Middle east. On the coast of the Black Sea in Russia, the mosquitofish is commemorated for eradicating malaria by a monument in Sochi.

Mosquitofish are still employed for biological control of mosquitoes in some places. In 2008, in some parts of California and in Clark County, Nevada, mosquitofish were bred in aquariums so people could stock stagnant pools of water with the mosquitofish to reduce the number of West Nile virus cases.

Through species distribution models, it has been revealed that &quot;G. affinis&quot; exhibit significant niche expansions beyond their natural climatic ranges, with a notable shift towards tropical regions in Asia. These findings highlight the ecological flexibility of these species, contributing to their extensive success and posing a substantial risk for further range expansion. Furthermore, it is assumed that the species will continue to spread in the course of climate change.

==Reproduction==
Reproduction of the mosquitofish starts with the male arranging the rays of the gonopodium (modified anal fin) into a slight tube. The male mosquitofish uses this tubular fin to secrete milt into the female&#x27;s genital aperture in the process of internal fertilization. The female&#x27;s genital aperture is located just behind the anal fin and is an opening for the milt to fertilize the ova within the ovary. Mosquitofish are within the infraclass Teleostei and as all teleosts, mosquitofish lack a uterus, so production of oocytes and gestation occur within the ovary of a female mosquitofish. Inside the female, sperm from multiple males can be stored to later fertilize ova. Based on laboratory experiments, female mosquitofish become vitellogenic when springtime temperatures reach , and then the oocytes mature when the average temperature reaches about . Then late in the summer when the photoperiod is less than 12.5 hours long, the next clutch of oocytes develops. In one reproductive season, a female may fertilize, with stored milt, two to six broods of embryos, with the size of the brood decreasing as the season progresses. Reproduction rates are highly dependent on temperature and ration level. As temperature increases from 20 to 30 °C, mean age at first reproduction decreases from 191 to 56 days, and brood size and mass of offspring increase significantly. Interbrood interval estimates at 25 and 30 °C are 23 and 19 days, respectively.

==Embryology==
Mosquitofish have a 16- to 28-day gestation period. They are lecithotrophic, which means during gestation, nutrients are provided to the embryos by a yolk sac. If the gestation period is shorter, each newborn will at birth still have a yolk sac connected through a slit located on the ventral side of the body wall. Brood size of females depends on the size of the given female; larger females are more capable of a larger brood quantity than smaller females. Many females have a brood quantity of up to or more than 60 young. Mosquitofish are viviparous, which means after the gestation of a brood, the female will have live birth. In most cases, the newborn brood will have an equal male to female sex ratio.

==Growth==
After birth, newborn mosquitofish are about in length. As juveniles, they grow at a rate of about per day, but growth is highly temperature-dependent. Growth rates of juvenile mosquitofish reach their peak when the water temperature is within a range of , depending on resource availability. As temperatures rise above or dip below this range, growth rates decrease. Consistent temperatures at or above are typically lethal, while growth stops when temperatures are at or below . For male mosquitofish, sexual maturity is reached in about 43 to 62 days, but maturation age is also dependent on temperature and resources. Female mosquitofish reach sexual maturity in about 21 to 28 days if born early within the reproductive season. The lifespan of a mosquitofish averages less than a year and the maximum is about 1.5 years. However, mosquitofish kept as pets can live much longer, with owners reporting lifespans of over three years. Male mosquitofish lifespans are considerably shorter than females.

<doc id="227407" wikidata="Q3333234" url="?curid=227407" title="Minnow">
<text>Minnow is the common name for a number of species of small freshwater fish, belonging to several genera of the family Cyprinidae and in particular the subfamily Leuciscinae. They are also known in Ireland as .

While the common name can refer to a range of taxa, smaller fish in the subfamily Leusciscinae are considered by anglers to be &quot;true&quot; minnows.

==Types of minnows==

Bluntnose minnow (&quot;Pimephales notatus&quot;): The bluntnose minnow is a primary bait fish for Northern America, and has a very high tolerance for variable water qualities, which helps its distribution throughout many regions. The snout of the bluntnose minnow overhangs the mouth, giving it the bluntnose. There is a dark lateral line which stretches from the opercle to the base of the tail, where a large black spot is located. The average size of the adult is approximately .

Common shiner (&quot;Notropis cornutus)&quot;: These fish are one of the most common type of bait fish and are almost exclusively stream dwellers. The common shiner can be identified by the nine rays on its anal fin and terminal mouth. This minnow is typically bluish silver on the sides and greenish blue on the back., save for breeding season in which case the male gains a rose colored tail and anal fin. The shiner grows about 5–10 cm (2–4 in) within one year and reach a size of at adulthood. &quot;Notropis potteri&quot; is known as the chub shiner.

Common emerald shiner (&quot;Notropis atherinoides atherinoides&quot;): Common shiners are most abundant in the Great Lakes of North America, primarily Lake Erie. The name of the emerald shiner comes from the greenish emerald band that expands from the back of the gill cover to the tail. This type of minnow has a short, rounded snout, the only difference between the common emerald shiner and the silver shiner is that the silver shiner has a longer snout and a larger eye. These fish grow to an average length of about 6 cm. This is one of the most common bait fish used in the Lake Erie region of Ohio and many fishermen hold it over all other bait.

* the minnows of the deep (&quot;Cyclothone sp.&quot;), small bioluminescent bristlemouth fish approximately long

==As food==
While primarily used for bait, minnows can also be eaten directly by humans. Some Native American cultures have used minnows as food. If minnows are small enough, they can be eaten whole.

==Threats and conservation issues== 
Generally, minnows breed with the slightest rainfall and within a wide temperature range. Contrary to the long-standing presumptions, climate change poses &#x27;negligible&#x27; threat to minnows&#x27; reproduction. Minnows are also flexible in attaining pre-spawning fitness, which makes them avoid &#x27;skipped spawning&#x27; decisions while facing climatic variabilities.

<text>The Monte Carlo Rally or Rallye Monte-Carlo (officially Rallye Automobile de Monte-Carlo) is a rallying event organized each year by the Automobile Club de Monaco. From its inception in 1911 by Prince Albert I, the rally was intended to demonstrate improvements and innovations in automobiles, and promote Monaco as a tourist resort on the Mediterranean shore. Before the format changed in 1997, the event was a “concentration rally” in which competitors would set off from various starting points around Europe and drive to Monaco, where the rally would continue to a set of special stages. The rally now takes place along the hills of the French Riviera and southeast France (Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur and the southern parts of Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes); the recentmost edition to have a special stage within the borders of Monaco as of January 2025 was the 2008 Monte Carlo Rally.

==History==
===1911 beginnings and controversy===
In 1909 the &quot;Automobile Club de Monaco&quot; (&quot;Sport Automobile Vélocipédique Monégasque&quot;) started planning a car rally at the behest of Albert I, Prince of Monaco. The Monte Carlo Rally was to start at points all over Europe and converge on Monte Carlo. In January 1911 23 cars set out from 11 different locations and Henri Rougier was among the nine who left Paris to cover a route. The event was won by Rougier in a Turcat-Méry 25 Hp. The rally comprised both driving and then somewhat arbitrary judging based on the elegance of the car, passenger comfort and the condition in which it arrived in the principality. The outcry of scandal when the results were published changed nothing, so Rougier was proclaimed the first winner.

Following the Second World War, works or works-supported teams became more and more important. From 1949 onwards, there was a special Team prize. First winners were the three Allards of Potter, Godsall and Imhof. Simca, Delahaye, Sunbeam-Talbot, Jaguar were subsequent winners. Sydney Allard – as the first and only winner driving his own car – was driving a &quot;works&quot; car in 1952, but Gatsonides also participated in a factory prepared Ford Zephyr in 1953, a year that saw no fewer than eight factory backed Sunbeam-Talbots.

===1966 controversy===
The 1966 event was the most controversial in the history of the Rally. The first four finishers, driving three Mini-Coopers, Timo Mäkinen, Rauno Aaltonen and Paddy Hopkirk, and Roger Clark&#x27;s 4th-placed Ford Cortina were all disqualified because they used non-dipping single filament quartz iodine bulbs in their headlamps, in place of the standard double filament dipping glass bulbs, which are fitted to the series production version of each models sold to the public. This elevated Pauli Toivonen (Citroën ID) into first place overall. Rosemary Smith (Hillman Imp) was also disqualified from sixth place, after winning the &quot;Coupe des Dames&quot;, the ladies&#x27; class. In all, ten cars were disqualified. Teams threatened to boycott the event. The headline in &quot;Motor Sport&quot; read &quot;The Monte Carlo Fiasco&quot;.

=== Recent history ===
From 1973 to 2008 the rally was held in January as the first event of the FIA World Rally Championship, but between 2009 and 2011 it was the opening round of the Intercontinental Rally Challenge (IRC) programme, a championship for N/A 4WD cars, before returning to the WRC championship season again in 2012. As recently as 1991, competitors were able to choose their starting points from approximately five venues roughly equidistant from Monte Carlo (one of Monaco&#x27;s administrative areas) itself.

With often varying conditions at each starting point (typically comprising dry tarmac, wet tarmac, snow, and ice, sometimes all in a single stage of the rally), this event places a big emphasis on tyre choices, as a driver has to balance the need for grip on ice and snow with the need for grip on dry tarmac. For the driver, this is often a difficult choice as the tyres that work well on snow and ice normally perform poorly on dry tarmac.

The Automobile Club de Monaco confirmed on 19 July 2010 that the 79th Monte-Carlo Rally would form the opening round of the new Intercontinental Rally Challenge season. To mark the centenary event, the Automobile Club de Monaco has also confirmed that Glasgow, Barcelona, Warsaw and Marrakesh have been selected as start points for the rally.

==Col de Turini==
This rally features one of the most famous special stages in the world. The stage is run from La Bollène-Vésubie to Sospel, or the other way around, over a steep and tight mountain road with many hairpin turns. On this 31 km route it passes over the &quot;Col de Turini&quot;, a mountain pass road which normally has ice and/or snow on sections of it at that time of the year. Spectators also throw snow on the road—in 2005, Marcus Grönholm and Petter Solberg both ripped a wheel off their cars when they skidded on snow probably placed there by spectators, and crashed into a wall. Grönholm went on to finish fifth, but Solberg was forced to retire as the damage to his car was extensive. In the same event, Sébastien Loeb set one of the fastest times in the modern era, with 21 minutes 40 seconds.

Sospel has an elevation of 479 m and the D70 has a maximum elevation of 1603 m, for an average gradient of 6.7%. The Turini is also driven at night, with thousands of fans watching the &quot;Night of Turini&quot;, also known as the &quot;Night of the Long Knives&quot; due to the strong high beam lights cutting through the night. In the 2007 edition of the rally, the Turini was not used, but it returned for the 2008 route. For both the 2009 and 2010 event the stage was run at night and shown live on Eurosport.

==The event as part of FIA Championships: ERC, WRC and IRC ==

From its introduction in 1953 to 1972 the Rallye was part of the European Rally Championship, except in 1968 and 1969. From 1973 to 2008 the rally was held in January as the first event of the FIA World Rally Championship, but between 2009 and 2011 it has been the opening round of the Intercontinental Rally Challenge (IRC) programme, a championship for N/A 4WD cars, before returning to the WRC championship season again in 2012. As recently as 1991, competitors were able to choose their starting points from approximately five venues roughly equidistant from Monte Carlo (one of Monaco&#x27;s administrative areas) itself.

The Monte Carlo Historic Rally (officially &quot;Rallye Monte-Carlo Historique&quot;) is a classic regularity rally held annually since 1998. The event currently takes place one week after the contemporary rally, and is open for car models from the 1960s through the early 1980s that participated in earlier editions of the original race. Unlike the contemporary rally it&#x27;s still a concentration rally with multiple departures throughout Europe.

The Classic Monte-Carlo Classic Rally (officially &quot;Rallye Monte-Carlo Classique&quot;) was a classic touring rally held annually from 2017 to 2022. It took place at the same time as the historic rally, and was open to cars from the 1910s through the early 1960s.

The Monte Carlo E-Rally (officially &quot;E-Rallye Monte-Carlo&quot;) is a regularity rally for alternative fuel vehicles, held annually under different names from 1995 to 1999 and later since 2005. It currently takes place in late October as part of the FIA ecoRally Cup.

<doc id="227417" wikidata="Q239135" url="?curid=227417" title="Anne Sullivan">
<text>Anne Sullivan Macy (born as Johanna Mansfield Sullivan; April 14, 1866 – October 20, 1936) was an American teacher best known for being the instructor and lifelong companion of Helen Keller. At the age of five, Sullivan contracted trachoma, an eye disease, which left her partially blind and without reading or writing skills. She received her education as a student of the Perkins School for the Blind. Soon after graduation at age 20, she became a teacher to Keller.

==Childhood==

On April 14, 1866, Sullivan was born in Feeding Hills, Agawam, Massachusetts, United States. The name on her baptismal certificate was Johanna Mansfield Sullivan but she was called &quot;Anne&quot; or &quot;Annie&quot; from birth. She was the eldest child of Thomas and Alice (Cloesy) Sullivan, who had emigrated from Ireland to the United States during the Great Famine.

When she was five years old, Sullivan contracted the bacterial eye disease trachoma, which caused many painful infections and over time made her nearly blind. When she was eight, her mother died from tuberculosis, and her father abandoned the children two years later for fear that he could not raise them on his own. She and her younger brother, James (Jimmie), were sent to the run-down and overcrowded almshouse in Tewksbury, Massachusetts, today part of Tewksbury Hospital, and their younger sister, Mary, was left to an aunt. Jimmie had a weak hip condition and then died from tuberculosis four months into their stay. Anne remained at Tewksbury after his death and endured two unsuccessful eye operations.

In 1875, as a result of reports of cruelty to inmates at Tewksbury, including sexually perverted practices and cannibalism, the Massachusetts Board of State Charities launched an investigation into the institution. The investigation was led by Franklin Benjamin Sanborn, then chairman of the board, and Samuel Gridley Howe, founder of the Perkins School for the Blind in Boston.

In February 1877, Sullivan was sent to the Soeurs de la Charité hospital in Lowell, Massachusetts, where she had another unsuccessful operation. While there, she helped the nuns in the wards and went on errands in the community until July of that year, when she was sent to the city infirmary, where she had one more unsuccessful operation. She was then transferred back to Tewksbury under duress. Instead of returning to the facility for predominantly ill and insane patients, she was housed with single mothers and unmarried pregnant women.

In 1880, during a subsequent inspection of Tewksbury by Franklin Benjamin Sanborn, now State Inspector of Charities, Sullivan implored of him to allow her to be admitted to the Perkins School for the Blind, in Watertown, Massachusetts. Within a matter of months, her plea was granted.

==Education==
On October 7, 1880, Sullivan began her studies at the Perkins School. Although her first years at Perkins were humiliating because of her rough manners, she managed to connect with a few teachers and made progress with her learning.

While at Perkins, Sullivan befriended Laura Bridgman, a graduate of Perkins and the first blind and deaf person to have been educated there; Sullivan learned the manual alphabet from Laura. During her time there, she had a series of eye operations that significantly improved her vision. In June 1886, graduating at age 20 as the valedictorian of her class, Sullivan stated:

==Career==
The summer after Sullivan had graduated, the director of Perkins School for the Blind, Michael Anagnos, was contacted by Arthur Keller, Helen Keller&#x27;s father, who was in search of a teacher for his seven-year-old blind and deaf daughter. Anagnos immediately recommended Sullivan for this position and she began her work on March 3, 1887, at the Kellers&#x27; home located in Alabama. As soon as she arrived, she argued with Helen&#x27;s parents about the Civil War and over the fact that they had owned slaves. At the same time, she quickly connected with Helen. It was the beginning of a 49-year relationship: Sullivan evolved from teacher to governess and finally to companion and friend.

Sullivan&#x27;s curriculum involved a strict schedule, with constant introduction of new vocabulary; however, she quickly changed her teaching method after seeing it did not suit Keller. Instead she began to teach her vocabulary based on her own interests, by spelling each word out into Keller&#x27;s palm; within six months this method proved to be working, since Keller had learned 575 words, some multiplication tables and the Braille system.

Sullivan strongly encouraged Helen&#x27;s parents to send her to the Perkins School, where she could have an appropriate education. Once they had agreed Sullivan took Keller to Boston in 1888 and stayed with her there. Sullivan continued to teach her bright protégée, who soon became famous for her remarkable progress. With the help of the school&#x27;s director, Anagnos, Keller became a public symbol for the school, helping to increase its funding and donations and making it the most famous and sought-after school for the blind in the country. An accusation of plagiarism against Keller greatly upset Sullivan; she left and never returned but remained influential to the school.

Sullivan remained a close companion to Keller and continued to assist in her education, which ultimately included a degree from Radcliffe College (now part of Harvard University). In 1916, Sullivan and Keller went on a lecture tour under the auspices of the Y.W.C.A. that brought them to the stage at the Mabel Tainter Memorial Building in Menomonie, Wisconsin, on January 22, 1916. During the hour-long presentation, Sullivan, identified as Mrs. Macy in the newspaper account, described her work with Keller, followed by Keller&#x27;s talk on &quot;Happiness&quot;.

==Personal life==
On May 3, 1905, Sullivan married Harvard University instructor and literary critic John Albert Macy (1877–1932), who had helped Keller with her publications. When she married, Sullivan was already living with Keller as her personal teacher, so Macy moved into the household of both women. However, within a few years, the marriage began to disintegrate. By 1914, they separated, though Macy is listed as living as a &quot;lodger&quot; with them in the 1920 U.S. Census. As the years progressed after their separation, Macy appears to have faded from her life, and the two never officially divorced. Macy died in 1932 of a heart attack. Sullivan never remarried.

==Awards==
In 1932, Sullivan and Keller were each awarded honorary fellowships from the Educational Institute of Scotland. They were also awarded honorary degrees from Temple University. In 1955, Keller was awarded an honorary degree from Harvard University, and in 1956 the director&#x27;s cottage at the Perkins School was named the Keller-Macy Cottage. In 2003, Sullivan was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

==Death==
Sullivan had been seriously visually impaired for almost all of her life, but by 1935, she became completely blind. On October 15, 1936, she had a coronary thrombosis, fell into a coma, and died five days later at the age of 70 in the Forest Hills neighborhood of Queens, New York, with Keller holding her hand. Keller described Sullivan as being very agitated during her last month of life, but during the last week, she was said to return to her normal generous self. Sullivan was cremated and her ashes interred in a memorial at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C. She was the first woman to be recognized for her achievements in this way. When Keller died in 1968, she was cremated as well and her ashes were interred alongside those of Sullivan.

==Media representation==
In the 1919 film &quot;Deliverance&quot; she is played by Edith Lyle. Sullivan is the main character in &quot;The Miracle Worker&quot; by William Gibson, originally produced for television in 1957, in which she was portrayed by Teresa Wright. &quot;The Miracle Worker&quot; then moved to Broadway and later was produced as a 1962 feature film. Both the play and the film featured Anne Bancroft as Sullivan. Patty Duke, who played Keller on Broadway and in the 1962 film, later played Sullivan in a 1979 television remake. Blythe Danner portrayed her in &quot;The Miracle Continues&quot; and Roma Downey portrayed her in the TV movie &quot;Monday After the Miracle&quot; (1998). Alison Elliott portrayed her in a 2000 television movie. Alison Pill played her on Broadway in the short-lived 2010 revival, with Abigail Breslin as Keller. In 1980, the United States Postal Service issued a commemorative stamp, honoring Sullivan and Keller.

<doc id="227422" wikidata="Q1169802" url="?curid=227422" title="Nehalennia">
<text>Nehalennia (spelled variously) is a goddess of unclear origin, perhaps Germanic or Celtic. She is attested on and depicted upon numerous votive altars discovered around what is now the province of Zeeland, the Netherlands, where the Schelde River flowed into the North Sea. Worship of Nehalennia dates back at least to the 2nd century BC and veneration of the goddess continued to flourish in northwestern Europe in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD.

==Name==
While the meaning of the name &quot;Nehalennia&quot; remains disputed, linguists agree that its origin is not Latin. Given the locations where most references and artifacts have been found, her name is likely from either a Germanic or Celtic language. Gutenbrunner (1936) related it to Proto-Germanic &quot;*nehwa&quot; &quot;close&quot;, but could not explain the rest of the name. Gysseling (1960) believed that the name was neither Celtic nor Germanic, rather stemming from the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;*neiH-&quot; &quot;to lead&quot;. He could not trace the rest of the name. De Stempel (2004) links her name with Welsh &quot;halein&quot; &quot;salt&quot; and &quot;heli&quot; &quot;sea&quot;, proposing a Celtic origin. She deconstructs the name as a combination of Celtic &quot;*halen–&quot; &quot;sea&quot; and &quot;*ne-&quot; &quot;on, at&quot;. Finally, &quot;*-ja&quot; is a suffix forming a feminine noun. The meaning would be &quot;she who is at the sea&quot;.

==Inscriptions==

Nehalennia is attested on 28 inscriptions discovered in 1645 in the Dutch town of Domburg on the Zeeland coast, when a storm eroded dunes. The remains of a temple were revealed that was devoted to the previously unattested goddess Nehalennia. Beginning in 1970, numerous altars, remains of female sculptures and related artifacts were found near in the town of Colijnsplaat, including roof tiles and remains of the temple devoted to Nehalennia that was in a former town, now lost. Two other temple remains have been found in the Cologne-Deutz area of what is now Cologne, Germany.

Dutch archaeologist J.E. Bogaers and Belgian linguist Maurits Gysseling, in their joint publication &quot;Over de naam van de godin Nehalennia&quot; (&quot;On the name of the goddess Nehalennia&quot;), listed several different forms of the name that appear in inscriptions. While &quot;Nehalennia&quot; is by far the most common spelling, &quot;Nehalenia&quot; and &quot;Nehalaennia&quot; both appear a few times. Gysseling characterizes these two forms as Latinisations of the more archaic &quot;Nehalennia&quot;. Several sporadic spellings, which are attested once each, were considered by Bogaers as non-standard or rejected as misread, due to the poor state of some of the inscriptions. Gysseling holds that some spellings are a transliteration, an attempt to approximate the pronunciation of her name in Latin script, suggesting that the &quot;h&quot; may have been pronounced as some German &quot;ch&quot; sound. One of the numerous altars dredged up from the Oosterschelde near Colijnsplaat in 1970 features the spelling Nechalenia. It appears that spellings with 𐌝 are intentional and not due to damaged artifacts.

The Domburg inscriptions to &quot;Nehalennia&quot; inspired Marcus Zuerius van Boxhorn to produce a hasty etymology linking the name &quot;Nehalennia&quot; to an ancient Scythian. With the linguistic tools then available, Van Boxhorn attempted to bridge the already-known connections between European languages and modern Persian.

==Depictions==
Nehalennia is almost always depicted with marine symbols and a large, benign-looking dog at her feet. She must have been a Celtic or Germanic deity who was attributed power over trading, shipping, and possible horticulture and fertility. In sculptures and reliefs, she is depicted as a young woman, generally seated. Typically she wears a short cloak over her shoulders and chest. This garment is unique to her and therefore might have belonged to the costumes usual at that period in this region. Often she is accompanied by a dog; she has as attributes a basket of apples or bread loaves and ship parts. 
Hilda Ellis Davidson describes the votive objects:

Nehalennia, a Germanic goddess worshipped at the point where travellers crossed the North Sea from the Netherlands, is shown on many carved stones holding loaves and apples like a Mother Goddess, sometimes with a prow of a ship beside her, but also frequently with an attendant dog which sits looking up at her (Plate 5). This dog is on thirteen of the twenty-one altars recorded by Ada Hondius-Crone (1955:103), who describes it as a kind of greyhound.

Davidson further links the motif of the ship associated with Nehalennia with the Germanic Vanir pair of Freyr and Freyja as well as the Germanic goddess Nerthus. She notes that Nehalennia features some of the same attributes as the Matres.
The loaves that Nehalennia is depicted with on her altars have been identified as &quot;duivekater&quot;, &quot;oblong sacrificial loaves in the shape of a shin bone&quot;. Davidson says that loaves of this type may take the place of an animal sacrifice or animal victim, such as the boar-shaped loaf baked at Yule in Sweden. In Värmland, Sweden, &quot;within living memory,&quot; there was a custom of grain from the last of the harvest customarily being used to bake a loaf in the shape of a little girl; this is subsequently shared by the whole household. Davidson provides further examples of elaborate harvest loaves in the shape of sheaves, and displayed in churches for the fertility of fields in Anglo-Saxon England, with parallels in Scandinavia and Ireland.

In 2005, a replica of the temple was built in Colijnsplaat. The design of temple and its sculpture is based on the finds from the nearby area, as well as archaeological study of the type of sanctuaries in the Roman provinces of Gaul and Germania. For the reconstruction, authentic materials and techniques were used as much as possible.

==Temples==
Religious practices surrounding Nehalennia were at their peak in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD, at which time there were at least two or three temples located in the area of what is now Zeeland. At the time, this region on the sea coast was an important link for the trade between the Rhine area and Britain. It is known that the Morini, who lived on the North Sea coast, worshipped Nehalennia. Visitors came to worship from as far away as Besançon, France and Trier, Germany. Nehalennia had two sanctuaries or shrines, embellished with numerous altars: one at Domburg on the island of Walcheren, and another at Colijnsplaat on the shore of the Oosterschelde.

In August 2005, a replica of the Nehalennia temple near the lost town of Ganuenta was opened in Colijnsplaat.

==In popular culture==
In 1960, an asteroid, Asteroid 2462 or 6578 P-L, was named after the goddess.

The name of the goddess was used in the Japanese manga &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; and its anime adaptations as the name of an enemy, though the character only bears a superficial resemblance to her namesake. Queen Nehel(l)enia is the leader of the enemy group called the Dead Moon Circus and in the manga and &quot;Crystal&quot; is a dark counterpart to Queen Serenity and an embodiment of Chaos. In the 90s anime, she is obsessed with eternal youth and beauty and devouring dreams, especially those of children.

Dutch band Heidevolk wrote a song about Nehalennia that is included on their 2010 album &quot;Uit oude grond&quot;.

Dutch band Twigs &amp; Twine call upon Nehalennia in one of the songs on their 2019 album &quot;Long Story Short&quot;.

<text>Perkins School for the Blind, in Watertown, Massachusetts, was founded in 1829 and is the oldest school for the blind in the United States. It has also been known as the Perkins Institution for the Blind.

Perkins manufactures its own Perkins Brailler, which is used to print embossed, tactile books for the blind; and the Perkins SMART Brailler, a braille teaching tool, at the Perkins Solutions division housed within the Watertown campus&#x27;s former Howe Press.

==History==
Founded in 1829, Perkins was the first school for the blind established in the United States. The school was originally named the New England Asylum for the Blind and was incorporated on March 2, 1829. The name was eventually changed to Perkins School for the Blind. John Dix Fisher first considered the idea of a school for blind children based upon his visits to Paris at the National Institute for the Blind and was inspired to create such a school in Boston, but it was founded by Samuel Gridley Howe, who had also studied education for the blind in Europe.

The school is named in honor of Thomas Handasyd Perkins, one of the organization&#x27;s incorporators. He was a Boston shipping merchant and slave trader who began losing his sight about the time the school was established. In 1833, the school outgrew its first location, the Pleasant Street house of the father of founder Howe. That year Perkins donated his Pearl Street mansion as the school&#x27;s second home. In 1839, Perkins sold the mansion and donated the proceeds.

This gift allowed the purchase of a more spacious building in South Boston. In 1885, were purchased in the Hyde Square section of Jamaica Plain, a residential district of Boston, to build a kindergarten, with Isabel Greeley as its first matron. This property was home to both Laura Bridgman and Helen Keller. The school moved to its present campus, in Watertown, Massachusetts, in the autumn of 1912.

Charles Dickens visited Perkins in 1842 during a lecture tour of America and was amazed at the work Howe was doing with Laura Bridgman, a deaf-blind girl who had come to the school in 1837 from New Hampshire. He wrote about his visit in his book, &quot;American Notes&quot;.

In 1887, Perkins director Michael Anagnos sent graduate Anne Sullivan to teach Helen Keller at her family&#x27;s home in Alabama. After working with her pupil at the Keller home, Sullivan returned to Perkins with Keller in 1888, and resided there intermittently until 1893. 

In 1931, Perkins created the Perkins Braille and Talking Book Library (BTBL).

In 1951, David Abraham successfully manufactured the first Perkins Brailler. By 1977, about 100,000 Perkins Braillers had been produced and distributed worldwide.

===Perkins today===
In the 21st century, Perkins has expanded its mission online to include resources for families with blind and visually impaired children, and teachers of the visually impaired (TVIs). Perkins has also worked with local partners in Asian countries to host an online community for educators, caregivers and families.

In 2011, Perkins completed construction of the Grousbeck Center for Students and Technology on its 38-acre campus in Watertown. This facility houses accessible technology for people who are blind or visually impaired.

In February 2016, Perkins launched Perkins Access, a team of expert accessibility consultants who partner with organizations across all industries to improve customer experience, employee experience, and brand engagement for all humans, regardless of age, ability, or means of access.

In July 2016, Perkins&#x27; &quot;Braille Trail&quot; was completed. It is located along the Charles River across the street from the rest of campus, and is part of the larger Watertown Riverfront Park.

In 2022, Perkins launched the Howe Innovation Center, dedicated to catalyzing and convening the &quot;DisabilityTech&quot; industry, including bringing together startups, investors, people with disabilities, and market experts.

==Perkins International==
Perkins partners with local groups in 67 countries: schools, universities, NGOs, nonprofits, government agencies, and parent networks—to educate and empower people who are blind, deaf/blind or visually impaired, and who may have additional disabilities. The organization disseminates resources, such as Perkins Braillers, funding, and expertise on the ground in these countries. One such example of this work in the African countries of Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya is Perkins&#x27; role in the Kilimanjaro Blind Trust, Inc. (KBT).

Special educators from other countries are also invited to the Watertown campus every year, for an intensive study of blindness and multiple-disability education. They can take back current information to their respective regions.

==Perkins Solutions==
Perkins Solutions concentrates on a broad array of assistive technology and accessibility assessment, training, and consulting. The range of Perkins Braillers ships to 175 countries and includes the Classic Brailler, the Next Generation Brailler and the Smart Brailler launched in 2012 with text-to-speech output, visual display, and applications for teaching braille. This subsidiary of Perkins also partners with associations for the blind and partially sighted, education ministers and resellers around the globe in an effort to provide accessible equipment—including Perkins Braillers, brailler repair and assistive technology—to all who need it.

==#BlindNewWorld==
On May 5, 2016, Perkins launched BlindNewWorld, a social change campaign aimed at helping the sighted population to be more inclusive of people who are blind and to make the world more accessible to them.

==National Deaf-Blind Equipment Distribution Program==
On June 8, 2012, in conjunction with the Helen Keller National Center (HKNC) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Perkins School for the Blind was selected to conduct nationwide outreach for the National Deaf-Blind Equipment Distribution Program (NDBEDP).

Mandated by the 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act (CVAA) and established by the FCC, the NDBEDP will aid individuals with combined vision and hearing loss connect with family, friends and their community by distributing accessible communications technology. Perkins&#x27; and partners&#x27; outreach campaign to educate people on this program is called iCanConnect. It aims to inform the nearly one million people in the United States with some sort of combined hearing and vision loss on the types of equipment—e.g. screen-enlargement software, video phones and electronic refreshable braille displays—available to them free of charge.

==Affiliations==
Perkins Braille and Talking Book Library works in conjunction with the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS) at its Watertown chapter.

Perkins has collaborated with the Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired on a Web resource called PathsToLiteracy.org, an online hub for information related to literacy for students who are blind or visually impaired, including those with additional disabilities or deafblindness.

Perkins has collaborated with Amy Bower, a blind oceanographer and senior scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, to show students what it&#x27;s like to be a blind scientist.

The international nonprofit has also worked with the American Foundation for the Blind to ensure that Expanded Core Curriculum (ECC) be taught in mainstream schools.

Perkins is a member of the Council of Schools for the Blind.

<text>is one of the Ōsumi Islands belonging to Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan. The island, in area, is the second largest of the Ōsumi Islands, and has a population of 33,000 people. Access to the island is by ferry, or by air to New Tanegashima Airport. Administratively, the island is divided into the city, Nishinoomote, and the two towns, Nakatane and Minamitane. The towns belong to Kumage District.

==Geography==
Tanegashima is the easternmost and the second largest (after Yakushima) of the Ōsumi Islands. It is located approximately south of the southern tip of Ōsumi Peninsula in southern Kyushu, or south of Kagoshima. The Vincennes Strait (Yakushima Kaikyō) separates it from Yakushima.

The island is of volcanic origin; however, unlike neighboring Yakushima, it presents a flat appearance, with its highest elevation at only above sea level. The island has a length of and a width ranging from to .
The climate is subtropical. The island, along with neighbouring Yakushima, has been recognised as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because they support populations of Japanese wood pigeons, Ryukyu green pigeons and Ryukyu robins.

==History==
Tanegashima has a long history of Kofun. Other burials on Tanegashima, namely the Yokomine and Hirota sites, attest to a uniquely well-developed Yayoi period culture at the end of the 4th century AD. The artifacts include magatama, an engraved pendant, and emblems with apparent writing.

During the Nara period, the embryo state of Japan began to make contact with Tanegashima. According to the &quot;Nihonshoki&quot;, the imperial court hosted a banquet for the islanders of Tanegashima in 677. In 679, the court sent a mission to the island who returned in 681. Other missions to the island mentioned in the book were in 683 and 695. According to the &quot;Shoku Nihongi&quot;, people from Tane, Yaku, Amami and Dokan (possibly Tokunoshima) came to the imperial court to pay tribute in 699. These activities resulted in the establishment of Tane Province on the island in 702. Tane Province lasted until 824 and was merged into Ōsumi Province.

Sometime around 1140, the whole island of Tanegashima became part of the Shimazu Estate, the largest medieval &quot;shōen&quot; of Japan. In the early Kamakura period, the positions of the land steward of the Shimazu Estate and the military governor of Ōsumi Province were given to the Shimazu clan. However, the clan lost these positions to the Hōjō clan, the de facto ruler of the shogunate. The Hōjō clan sent the Higo clan as deputy governors. A branch line of the Higo clan made itself autonomous on Tanegashima after the Hōjō clan was annihilated and began to claim the clan name of Tanegashima.

The Tanegashima clan ruled the island until the Meiji restoration. The Tanegashima clan enjoyed a high degree of autonomy until Shimazu unified southern Kyūshū in the late 16th century, and after that, served as a top-ranking retainer to the Satsuma domain. Following the Meiji restoration, the island has been administered as part of Kagoshima Prefecture.

===Introduction of firearms into Japan===

Tanegashima is traditionally known as the site of the introduction of European firearms to Japan in 1543. Until modern times, firearms were colloquially known in Japan as &quot;Tanegashima&quot;, due to the belief that they were introduced by the Portuguese on board the first Portuguese ship. 

In his memoirs published in 1614, Portuguese adventurer turned author, Fernão Mendes Pinto placed himself in the first landing party, although this claim has since been roundly discredited and in fact contradicts his claims to have been in Burma at the time. The two Portuguese traders, António Mota and Francisco Zeimoto, should actually be credited as the first Europeans to introduce firearms. However, Mendes Pinto does appear to have visited Tanegashima soon thereafter. The Europeans had arrived to trade, not only guns, but also soap, tobacco and other goods unknown in medieval Japan, for Japanese goods.

During the Muromachi period, Tanegashima functioned as a relay station for one of the main routes of Chinese trade that connected Sakai to Ningbo. The Tanegashima clan cooperated with the Hosokawa clan, one of two powers who controlled Chinese trade. The clan also maintained a firm connection with the Honnō-ji Temple of Kyoto. These account for the rapid spread of firearms from Tanegashima to central Japan.

===Knife industry===
Edge tools (particularly knives and scissors) made in Tanegashima are famous traditional handicrafts in Japan. Craftsmen in Tanegashima have kept alive traditional techniques for forging and sharpening iron tools. Tanegashima is also famous as the center of iron sand production. The technique has been around since about 1185 when the Taira clan were exiled here from Kyoto by Minamoto no Yoritomo, taking with them craftsmen and chefs from Kyoto. The people of the island speak with a Kyoto accent even now, rather than a Kyūshū or Kagoshima accent, despite its proximity to Kyūshū. These craftsmen were the original users of the distinct techniques used for forging and sharpening. The technique is unique in the world, and produces such tools as &quot;Tanegashima Hōchō&quot; (Tanegashima knives), used by chefs, and &quot;Tane-basami&quot; (Tanegashima scissors), preferred by many for the art of Bonsai. Nevertheless the local population has fallen from over fifty thousand in 1970 to just twenty-eight thousand today, in spite of tourism and space industries, putting traditional crafts at risk.

==Tanegashima Space Center==

The Tanegashima Space Center is Japan&#x27;s largest space development center. It is run by JAXA, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency and is located at the southeastern end of Tanegashima. It was established in 1969 when the National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) was formed. Activities include assembly, testing, launching and tracking satellites, as well as rocket engine firing tests. Activity includes orbital launches of the H-IIA rockets from the Yoshinobu Launch Complex. 

The Space Science and Technology Museum is near the TSC. It offers an intricate view of rocket history and technology in Japan. Though most of the displays are in Japanese, there are English tour pamphlets available.

==Climate==
Tanegashima has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;) with hot, humid summers and mild winters. Precipitation is high throughout the year, but is highest in the months of May, June and September.

==Sporting events==
The Tanegashima &quot;Rocket Marathon&quot; takes place in March each year.

<doc id="227435" wikidata="Q850925" url="?curid=227435" title="Grass warbler">
<text>The grass warblers are small passerine birds belonging to the genus Locustella. Formerly placed in the paraphyletic &quot;Old World warbler&quot; assemblage, they are now considered the northernmost representatives of a largely Gondwanan family, the Locustellidae.

These are rather drab brownish &quot;warblers&quot; usually associated with fairly open grassland, shrubs or marshes. Some are streaked, others plain, all are difficult to view. They are insectivorous.

The most characteristic feature of this group is that the song of several species is a mechanical insect-like reeling which gives rise to the group&#x27;s scientific name.

Species breeding in temperate regions are strongly migratory.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Locustella&quot; was introduced by the German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup in 1829 with the common grasshopper warbler (&quot;Locustella naevia&quot;) as the type species. The genus name &quot;Locustella&quot; is from Latin and is a diminutive of &quot;locusta&quot;, &quot;grasshopper&quot;. Like the English name, this refers to the insect-like song of some species.

There are 23 species placed in the genus:
*Lanceolated warbler, &quot;Locustella lanceolata&quot;
*Brown bush warbler, &quot;Locustella luteoventris&quot;
*Long-billed bush warbler, &quot;Locustella major&quot;
*Common grasshopper warbler, &quot;Locustella naevia&quot;
*Chinese bush warbler, &quot;Locustella tacsanowskia&quot;
*Bamboo warbler, &quot;Locustella alfredi&quot;
*River warbler &quot;Locustella fluviatilis&quot;
*Savi&#x27;s warbler, &quot;Locustella luscinioides&quot;
*Friendly bush warbler, &quot;Locustella accentor&quot;
*Sulawesi bush warbler, &quot;Locustella castanea&quot;
*Seram bush warbler, &quot;Locustella musculus&quot;
*Buru bush warbler, &quot;Locustella disturbans&quot;
*Long-tailed bush warbler, &quot;Locustella caudata&quot;
*Baikal bush warbler, &quot;Locustella davidi&quot;
*Spotted bush warbler, &quot;Locustella thoracica&quot;
*West Himalayan bush warbler, &quot;Locustella kashmirensis&quot;
*Taiwan bush warbler, &quot;Locustella alishanensis&quot;
*Russet bush warbler, &quot;Locustella mandelli&quot;
*Dalat bush warbler, &quot;Locustella idonea&quot;
*Benguet bush warbler, &quot;Locustella seebohmi&quot;
*Javan bush warbler, &quot;Locustella montis&quot;
*Sichuan bush warbler, &quot;Locustella chengi&quot;
*Taliabu bush warbler, &quot;Locustella portenta&quot;

This genus formerly included additional species. A molecular phylogenetic study of the grassbird family Locustellidae published in 2018 found that the genus &quot;Locustella&quot; consisted of two distinct clades. The genus was split and six species were moved to the newly erected genus &quot;Helopsaltes&quot;.

A fossil acrocoracoid from the Late Miocene (about 11 mya) of Rudabánya (NE Hungary) is quite similar to this bone in the present genus. Given its rather early age (most Passerida genera are not known until the Pliocene), it is not too certain that it is correctly placed here, but it is highly likely to belong to the Locustellidae, or the Sylvioidea at the least. As the grasshopper warblers are the only known locustellid warblers from Europe, it is still fairly likely that the bone piece belongs to a basal &quot;Locustella&quot;.

<text>The first USS &quot;Columbus&quot; was a ship in the Continental Navy. Built as a merchant ship at Philadelphia in 1774 as &quot;Sally&quot;, she was purchased from Willing, Morris &amp; Co., for the Continental Navy in November 1775, Captain Abraham Whipple was given command.

Between 17 February and 8 April 1776, in company with the other ships of Commodore Esek Hopkins&#x27; squadron, &quot;Columbus&quot; took part in the expedition to New Providence, Bahamas, where the first Navy-Marine amphibious operation seized essential military supplies. On the return passage, the squadron captured the British schooner, &quot;Hawk&quot;, on 4 April, and brig &quot;Bolton&quot; on the 5th. On 6 April the squadron engaged . After three hours the action was broken off and &quot;Glasgow&quot; escaped, leaving her tender to be captured. Later in 1776 &quot;Columbus&quot; cruised off the New England coast taking five prizes.

Chased ashore on Point Judith, Rhode Island, 27 March 1778 by a British squadron, &quot;Columbus&quot; was stripped of her sails, most of her rigging, and other usable material by her crew before being abandoned. She was burned by the enemy.

<text>Old Norse Yngvi , Old High German Ing/Ingwi and Old English Ing are names that relate to a theonym which appears to have been the older name for the god Freyr. Proto-Germanic Ingwaz was the legendary ancestor of the Ingaevones, or more accurately &quot;Ingvaeones&quot;, and is also the reconstructed name of the Elder Futhark rune ᛜ and Anglo-Saxon rune ᛝ, representing &quot;ŋ&quot;.

==Etymology==

Old Norse &quot;Yngvi&quot; as well as Old High German &quot;Inguin&quot; and Old English &quot;Ingƿine&quot; are all derived from the Proto-Germanic *Ingwaz. Sound changes in late-Proto-Germanic transformed *Ingwaz into *Ingwi(z) in the nominative case and *&quot;Ingwin&quot; in the accusative case. His epithet *Fraujaz appears in Old Norse compounds &quot;Ingvifreyr&quot; and &quot;Ingunarfreyr&quot;. In Beowulf we see Hrothgar called (OE) &quot;fréa inguina&quot;, which means &#x27;Lord of the Inguins&#x27;, i.e. lord of the Ingvaeones, the &#x27;friends of Ing&#x27;. This strongly indicates that the two deities, Ing and Freyr are indeed the same. However, it is also possible that Ing and Freyr were separate people because they had different fathers. Ing&#x27;s father was Mannus. Freyr&#x27;s father was Njörðr. The Ingvaeones, who occupied a territory roughly equivalent to modern Denmark, Frisia, Northern Germany, and the Low Countries at the turn of the millennium, were mentioned by Pliny the Elder in his &quot;Natural Histories&quot; as one of &quot;five Germanic tribes&quot;. Tacitus asserts their descent from the three sons of Mannus or *Mannaz cognate with Manus in Hinduism, the &#x27;first man&#x27;, of whom *Ingwaz may have been one. Other names that retain the theonym are or &quot;Ingemar&quot; and &quot;Yngling&quot;, the name of an old Scandinavian dynasty.

==The Ingwaz rune==

The &#x27; rune (with variants and ) together with Peorð and Eihwaz is among the problematic cases of runes of uncertain derivation unattested in early inscriptions. The rune may have been an original innovation, or it may have been adapted from the classical Latin alphabet&#x27;s &quot;Q&quot;. The rune first appears independently on the &quot;futhark&quot; row of the Kylver Stone, and is altogether unattested as an independent rune outside of such rows. There are a number of attestations of the &#x27; bind rune or (the &quot;lantern rune&quot;, similar in shape to the Anglo-Saxon gēr rune ), but its identification is disputed in most cases, since the same sign may also be a cipher rune of wynn or thurisaz. The earliest case of such an &#x27; bindrune of reasonably certain reading is the inscription &#x27; (perhaps referring to the &quot;Mærings&quot; or Ostrogoths) on the silver buckle of Szabadbattyán, dated to the first half 5th century and conserved at the Hungarian National Museum in Budapest.

The Old English rune poem contains these obscure lines:

A torc, the so-called &quot;Ring of Pietroassa&quot;, part of a late third to fourth century Gothic hoard discovered in Romania, is inscribed in much-damaged runes, one reading of which is &quot;gutanī [i(ng)]wi[n] hailag&quot; &quot;to Ingwi[n] of the Goths holy&quot;.

== Norse mythology ==
In Norse mythology, Yngvi, alternatively spelled Yngve, was the progenitor of the Yngling lineage, a legendary dynasty of Swedish kings, from whom also the earliest historical Norwegian kings claimed to be descended. Yngvi is a name of the god Freyr, perhaps Freyr&#x27;s true name, as &quot;freyr&quot; means &#x27;lord&#x27; and has probably evolved from a common invocation of the god.

In the &quot;Íslendingabók&quot; (written in the early twelfth century by the Icelandic priest Ari Þorgilsson) &quot;Yngvi Tyrkja konungr&quot; &#x27;Yngvi king of Turkey&#x27; appears as the father of Njörðr who in turn is the father of Yngvi-Freyr, ancestor of the Ynglings. According to the &quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot; (a lost epic from 1180 to 1200, saved only partially in other sagas and later translation) Odin came from Asia and conquered Northern Europe. He gave Sweden to his son Yngvi and Denmark to his son Skjöldr. Since then the kings of Sweden were called Ynglings and those of Denmark Skjöldungs.

In the &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; (late twelfth century, by Saxo Grammaticus) and in the &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; (ca. 1225, by Snorri Sturluson), Freyr is euhemerized as a king of Sweden. In the &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;, Yngvi-Freyr reigned in succession to his father Njörðr who had – in this variant – succeeded Odin. In the &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot; (written around 1211), in contrast, Ingui is the first king of Sweden, and the father of a certain Neorth, in his turn the father of Froyr: &quot;Rex itaque Ingui, quem primum Swethiæ monarchiam rexisse plurimi astruunt, genuit Neorth, qui vero genuit Froy; hos ambos tota illorum posteritas per longa sæcula ut deos venerati sunt. Froyr vero genuit Fiolni, qui in dolio medonis dimersus est […]&quot;

In the introduction to his &quot;Edda&quot; (originally composed around 1220) Snorri Sturluson claimed again that Odin reigned in Sweden and relates: &quot;Odin had with him one of his sons called Yngvi, who was king in Sweden after him; and those houses come from him that are named Ynglings.&quot; Snorri here does not identify Yngvi and Freyr, although Freyr occasionally appears elsewhere as a son of Odin instead of a son of Njörðr.

In the &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; section of his &quot;Prose Edda&quot; Snorri brings in the ancient king Halfdan the Old who is the father of nine sons whose names are all words meaning &quot;king&quot; or &quot;lord&quot; in Old Norse, as well as of nine other sons who are the forefathers of various royal lineages, including &quot;Yngvi, from whom the Ynglings are descended&quot;. But rather oddly Snorri immediately follows this with information on what should be four other personages who were not sons of Halfdan but who also fathered dynasties, and names the first of these again as &quot;Yngvi, from whom the Ynglings are descended&quot;. In the related account in the &quot;Ættartolur&quot; &quot;Genealogies&quot; attached to &quot;Hversu Noregr byggðist&quot;, the name &quot;Skelfir&quot; appears instead of &quot;Yngvi&quot; in the list of Halfdan&#x27;s sons.

The &quot;Ynglinga Saga&quot; section of Snorri&#x27;s &quot;Heimskringla&quot; (around 1230) introduces a second Yngvi, son of Alrekr, who is a descendant of Yngvi-Freyr and who shared the Swedish kingship with his brother Álf (&quot;see&quot; Yngvi and Alf).

==Given names and family names==
The element &quot;Ing(o)-&quot; was widely used in Germanic names from an early period; it is not clear whether it originally referred to the Ingaevones, or to the god Yngwi directly. &quot;Inguiomer&quot; (&quot;Inguiomarus&quot;) was a relative of the Cheruscian Arminius in the first century. &quot;Ingundis&quot; was a wife of the Frankish king Chlothar I, whose son Charibert I married an &quot;Ingoberga&quot; (all in the sixth century). Other combinations such as masculine &quot;Inguin&quot;, &quot;Ingulf&quot;, &quot;Ingobald&quot;, feminine &quot;Inghildis&quot;, &quot;Ingedrudis&quot;, &quot;Ingoflidis&quot;, as well as the short forms &quot;Ingo&quot; (masculine) and &quot;Inga&quot; (feminine) are recorded in the early medieval period (seventh to ninth centuries). In Scandinavia and Germany, and areas where these groups settled, names beginning with &quot;Ing&quot; survived into modern usage, e.g. Ingmar, Ingvar, Ingvild, Ingeborg, Ingrid, Ingegerd and the family name Ingalls. In most Slavic nations there also exists a name of Igor, of Scandinavian origin, supposedly having the same origin as many similar Scandinavian names, possibly coming from the name Ingvar.

<text>Arnold Zweig (10 November 1887 – 26 November 1968) was a German Jewish writer, pacifist and socialist.

==Early life and education==
Zweig was born in Glogau, Prussian Silesia (now Głogów, Poland), the son of Adolf Zweig, a Jewish shipping agent and harness maker, and his wife Bianca. (He is not related to Stefan Zweig.) After attending a science-oriented gymnasium in Kattowitz (Katowice), between 1907 and 1914 he studied several branches of the humanities, history, philosophy and literature, at several universities – Breslau (Wrocław), Munich, Berlin, Göttingen, Rostock and Tübingen. He was especially influenced by Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s philosophy. His first literary works, &quot;Novellen um Claudia&quot; (1913) and &quot;Ritualmord in Ungarn&quot;, gained him wider recognition.

==World War One==
Zweig volunteered for the German army in World War I and served as a private in France, Hungary and Serbia. He was stationed in the Western Front at the time when Judenzählung (the Jewish census) was administered in the German army. Shaken by the experience, he wrote in his letter dated 15 February 1917, to Martin Buber: &quot;The Judenzählung was a reflection of unheard sadness for Germany&#x27;s sin and our agony. ... If there was no antisemitism in the army, the unbearable call to duty would be almost easy.&quot; He began to revise his views on the war and came to view the war as one that pitted Jews against Jews. Later he described his experiences in the short story &quot;Judenzählung vor Verdun&quot;. The war changed Zweig from a Prussian patriot to an eager pacifist.

In 1917, Zweig was assigned to the Press department of the German Army Headquarters in Kaunas, Lithuania where he was introduced to the East European Jewish organizations.

In a quite literal effort to put a face to the hated &#x27;Ostjude&#x27; (Eastern European Jew), due to their Orthodox, economically depressed, &quot;unenlightened&quot;, &quot;un-German&quot; ways, Zweig published with the artist Hermann Struck &quot;Das ostjüdische Antlitz&quot; (&quot;The Face of East European Jewry&quot;) in 1920. This was a blatant effort to at least gain sympathy among German-speaking Jews for the plight of their eastern European compatriots. With the help of many simple sketches of faces, Zweig supplied interpretations and meaning behind them.

After World War I Zweig was an active socialist Zionist in Germany. After Hitler&#x27;s attempted coup in 1923 he went to Berlin and worked as an editor of a newspaper, the &quot;Jüdische Rundschau&quot;.

==1920 - 1933==
In the 1920s, Zweig became attracted to the psychoanalytical theories of Sigmund Freud and underwent Freudian therapy. In March 1927 he wrote to Freud asking permission to dedicate his new book to him. In his letter Zweig told Freud: &quot;I personally owe to your psychological therapy the restoration of my whole personality, the discovery that I was suffering from a neurosis and finally the curing of this neurosis by your method of treatment.&quot; Freud replied with a warm letter, and their correspondence continued for a dozen years, a momentous period in Germany&#x27;s history. Their correspondence was published in book form.

In 1927 Zweig published the anti-war novel &quot;The Case of Sergeant Grischa&quot;, which made him an international literary figure, with the English version selected in the USA as a Book of the Month title. The theme of his sequence of World War I fiction is that Germany was perverted by brutal men who shifted the purpose of the war from defense to conquest. Major contestants in this struggle are characters in his books. Some, like Kaiser Wilhelm II, Field Marshal von Hindenburg, and commander on the Eastern Front during the last two years of the war Prince Leopold of Bavaria, are named. Others are masked, but would have been easily identified by many readers at the time: for example, General Ludendorff is &quot;Schieffenzahn&quot;, the politician Matthias Erzberger is &quot;Deputy Hemmerle&quot;, General Max Hoffmann is &quot;Clauss&quot;, and Field Marshal von Eichhorn is &quot;von Lychow&quot;.

From 1929 he was a contributing journalist of socialist newspaper &quot;Die Weltbühne&quot; (&quot;World Stage&quot;). That year, Zweig would attend one of Hitler&#x27;s speeches. He told his wife that the man was a Charlie Chaplin without the talent. In 1933, Zweig witnessed the destruction of his books in the Nazi book burning. He remarked that the crowds &quot;would have stared as happily into the flames if live humans were burning.&quot; He decided to leave Germany that night.

==Exile in Palestine==
When the Nazi Party took power in Germany in 1933, Zweig was one of many Jews who immediately went into exile. Zweig went first to Czechoslovakia, then Switzerland and France. After spending some time with Thomas Mann, Lion Feuchtwanger, Anna Seghers and Bertolt Brecht in France, he set out for Mandatory Palestine, then under British rule.

In Haifa, Palestine, he published a German-language newspaper, the &quot;Orient&quot;. In Palestine, Zweig became close to a group of German-speaking immigrants who felt distant from Zionism and viewed themselves as refugees or exiles from Europe, where they planned to return. This group included Max Brod, Else Lasker-Schüler and Wolfgang Hildesheimer. During his years in Palestine, Zweig became disillusioned with Zionism and turned to socialism.

In Haifa, Zweig underwent psychoanalysis with Ilja Shalit. His novels &quot;De Vriendt Goes Home&quot; and &quot;A Costly Dream&quot; are partly set in Mandatory Palestine and describe, among other things, the encounter between Zionism, socialism and psychoanalysis. In &quot;De Vriendt Goes Home&quot;, a young Zionist, recently immigrated to Palestine from Eastern Europe, kills the Dutch Jew De Vriendt who, on the basis of a more orthodox religious sentiment, was seeking an understanding with the local Arab population. During his stay in Palestine, Zweig may have been the main link between Freud and the local psychoanalytic community. In 1935, &quot;Education Before Verdun&quot;, the third novel of Zweig&#x27;s cycle &quot;The Great War of the White Men&quot; came out and, like its predecessor &quot;The Case of Sergeant Grischa&quot; it was translated into many languages, and, once more, the US edition became a &quot;Book of the Month&quot; selection for 1936.

Zweig&#x27;s 1947 novel The axe of Wandsbek is based upon the Altona Bloody Sunday (in German: &quot;Altonaer Blutsonntag&quot;) riot which resulted from the march by the Sturmabteilung, the original paramilitary wing of the Nazi Party, in Altona on 17 July 1932. The march turned violent and resulted in 18 people being shot dead, including four Communists including Bruno Tesch who were beheaded for their alleged involvement in the riot. An East German film, The Axe of Wandsbek, was later made about the riot and was adapted from Zweig&#x27;s novel. The authorised version of the film, which was 20 minutes shorter than the original, was screened in 1962, in honour of Zweig&#x27;s 75th birthday.

==East Germany==
In 1948, after a formal invitation from the East German authorities, Zweig decided to return to the Soviet occupation zone in Germany (which became East Germany in 1949). In East Germany he was in many ways involved in the communist system. He was a member of parliament, delegate to the World Peace Council Congresses and the cultural advisory board of the communist party. He was President of the DDR Academy of Arts, Berlin from 1950 to 1953.

He was rewarded with many prizes and medals by the regime. The USSR awarded him the Lenin Peace Prize (1958) for his anti-war novels. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature seven times.

After 1962, due to poor health, Zweig virtually withdrew from the political and artistic fields. Arnold Zweig died in East Berlin on 26 November 1968, aged 81.

<doc id="227452" wikidata="Q242176" url="?curid=227452" title="Yakushima">
<text>is one of the Ōsumi Islands in Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan. The island, in area, has a population of 13,178. Access to the island is by hydrofoil ferry (7 or 8 times a day from Kagoshima, depending on the season), slow car ferry (once or twice a day from Kagoshima), or by air to Yakushima Airport (3 to 5 times daily from Kagoshima, once daily from Fukuoka and once daily from Osaka).
Administratively, the whole island is the town of Yakushima. The town also serves neighbouring Kuchinoerabujima. 42% of the island is within the borders of the Yakushima National Park.

Yakushima&#x27;s electricity is more than 50% hydroelectric, and surplus power has been used to produce hydrogen gas in an experiment by Kagoshima University. The island has been a test site for Honda&#x27;s hydrogen fuel cell vehicle research. Hydrogen cars are not stationed on the island, but rather electric cars are run by the municipality.

==World Heritage designation==
In 1980, an area of was designated a UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Reserve. In 1993, of wetland at Nagata-hama was designated a Ramsar Site. It is the largest nesting ground for the endangered loggerhead sea turtle in the North Pacific. Yakushima&#x27;s unique remnant of warm/temperate ancient forest has been a natural World Heritage Site since 1993. In the Wilderness core area () of the World Heritage Site, no record of past tree cutting can be traced.

The island is visited by 300,000 tourists every year.

==Geography==
===Overview===

Yakushima is located approximately south of the southern tip of Ōsumi Peninsula in southern Kyushu, or south of Kagoshima. The Vincennes Strait (Yakushima Kaikyō) separates it from the nearby island of Tanegashima, which is home to the Japanese Space Centre. Periodic rocket launches from Tanegashima can clearly be seen from Yakushima.

The bedrock of the island is granite, and as such it hosts no active volcanoes. It has an area of approximately . The island is roughly circular in shape, with a circumference of and a diameter of . The highest elevations on the island are , with a height of , and , with a height of above sea level; however, Yakushima has another 30 peaks of over in height. There are numerous hot springs on the island.
===Settlements===
Major settlements of the island, composing Yakushima Municipality, are the port towns of Anbō and Miyanoura. Between them is located Yakushima Airport. Other settlements are the coastal villages of Onoaida, Hirauchi, Kurio, Nagata and the abandoned forest village of Kosugidani. Among the localities, there are the gorges of Shiratani Unsui, Arakawa, Yakushima Airport, Kigensugi and Yakusugi.

==History==
Yakushima has been settled since at least the Jōmon period. It was first mentioned in written documents of the Chinese Sui dynasty of the 6th century. 
In 601, the Chinese sent an expedition to the &quot;Country of Liukiu&quot; (流求國). They noted that the people were small but pugnacious. The Chinese could not understand the local language and returned to China. In 607, they sent another expedition to trade, and brought back one of the islanders. A Japanese embassy was in Louyang when the expedition returned, and one of the Japanese exclaimed that the islander wore the dress and spoke the language of Yaku Island.

In the Japanese &quot;Shoku Nihongi&quot; in an entry dated 702 CE. It formed part of ancient Tane Province. It was often mentioned in the diaries of travelers between Tang dynasty China and Nara period Japan.

During the Edo period, Yakushima was ruled by the Shimazu clan of the Satsuma Domain and was considered part of Ōsumi Province. Following the Meiji restoration, the island has been administered as part of Kagoshima Prefecture.

In 2017, Yakushima was struck by Typhoon Noru causing one death.

In November 2023, a United States Air Force V-22 Osprey crashed off the coast of Yakushima, killing 7 crewmen with 1 last crewman missing.

==Demographics and economics==
The population of Yakushima reached a peak in 1960 with 24,010 inhabitants. It thereafter declined until about 1995, but has subsequently stabilized at just over 13,000 inhabitants.

Traditionally, the economic mainstays of the population were forestry and the export of wood products (principally cedar roof shingles), and commercial fishing. Cultivation of oranges and tea, the distilling of shōchū, and tourism are now the main sources of income. 

==Flora and fauna==

Yakushima contains one of the largest tracts of existing Nansei Islands subtropical evergreen forests, an endangered habitat ecoregion. The only large animals indigenous to the island are red-bottomed macaques (Yakushima macaque) and a variety of sika deer (&quot;yakushika&quot;). The Japanese raccoon dog is also a common animal, but is not native to the island. Japanese weasels (&quot;Mustela itatsi&quot;) may also be seen from time to time. The island is a spawning ground for migratory loggerhead turtles, and dolphins are to be found offshore. The coastal areas have coral reefs in places, although to a much lesser extent than are found farther south in the islands of Okinawa. The island, along with neighbouring Tanegashima, has been recognised as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because they support populations of Japanese wood pigeons, Ryukyu green pigeons and Ryukyu robins.

Yakushima is famous for its lush vegetation. Most of the island has at one time or another been logged (dating back at least to the early Edo period), but has been extensively replanted and reseeded since logging ended in the late 1960s, at which time a conservation regime was established. In addition to this secondary forest, there are some remaining areas of primary forest, composed mainly of a variety of &quot;Cryptomeria japonica,&quot; or Japanese cedar, known as , the best known single example of which is named the , as its age is estimated to date to at least the Jōmon period of Japanese history, 2300 years ago. In addition, the island lists over 50 varieties of endemic flower, notably rhododendrons, and hundreds of rare endemic &quot;Bryophyta,&quot; as well as a number of endemic trees.

==Climate==
Yakushima has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;) with hot, humid summers and mild winters. Precipitation is extremely heavy, with at least in each month and as much as in June alone. Yakushima is Japan&#x27;s wettest place, and annual precipitation in Yakushima is one of the world&#x27;s highest at . It is said by the locals to rain &quot;35 days a month&quot;. There are drier periods in autumn and winter, while the heaviest downpours occur in spring and summer, often accompanied by landslides. It is the southernmost place in Japan where there is snow in the mountains, often for months, while the ocean temperature is never below 


===Pollution===
According to a disputed theory, airborne pollutants from the People&#x27;s Republic of China may have affected Yakushima white pine in the forest on the island. The scientific results have been published in a 2009 paper.

==Transportation==
===Airport===
Yakushima Airport (KUM) is the only airport serving the island. Scheduled commercial flights are operated by Japan Air Commuter, a JAL subsidiary. As of 2019, the runway was in the process of extension from 1500m to 2000m, which would allow jet aircraft to operate and a wider range of destinations to be served. As of January 2024, the runway expansion has not progressed and remains at a length of 1500m.

===Buses===
The number of bus routes is relatively high on both Tanegashima and Yakushima. They operate from morning until evening. However, the frequency of buses on each route is low, so careful planning is required.

===Cars===
There are several rental car companies. The northwestern road, called the Western Forest Road, is a narrow road on which it is difficult for cars to pass each other. The road is often closed due to steep curves, slopes, and occasional landslides. Gasoline prices on the island are significantly higher than on the Japanese mainland.

===Railway===
The last operating narrow gauge (762mm gauge) timber railway in Japan is on the island but it is freight only. Several other lines did operate but are now closed. The track is used by some hikers as a path but this can be dangerous as the line is very much still in operation.

There are several onsen (hot springs) on Yakushima.

*Hirauchi underwater hot spring
*Jomon no Yado Manten – outpatient Bathing
*Onoma Onsen
*Oura hot spring – originally a hot spring, but it&#x27;s now a communal bath with boiling spring water

<doc id="227455" wikidata="Q5964896" url="?curid=227455" title="USS Columbus (1819)">
<text>USS &quot;Columbus&quot; was a 92-gun ship of the line in the United States Navy. Although construction of the warship was authorized by Congress on 2 January 1813, the burning of the Washington Navy Yard by the Americans in 1814 just prior to the British occupation of Washington, intended to keep US military stores out of enemy hands, led to the destruction of any initial framing. Days after Congress re-authorized the vessel on 29 April 1816, a keel was laid and construction resumed.

&quot;Columbus&quot; was launched on 1 March 1819 into the Anacostia River at the Washington Navy Yard; her dimensions were &quot;191 feet 10 inches, between perpendiculars; breadth of beam from outside to outside, 53 feet 6 inches&quot;. The warship was commissioned on 29 November 1819, Master Commandant John H. Elton, commanding. Her original armament comprised &quot;92 guns: 68 long 32-pounders and twenty-four 42-pounder carronades&quot;; this was greater than the Naval artillery equipping most of the nine ships-of-the-line authorized by Congress in the 1816 legislation, which specified that these warships &quot;rate not less than seventy-four guns each&quot;.

Enslaved laborer and diarist, Michael Shiner, documented the launching thus, &quot;The United States Ship Columbus 74, constructed and built by Colonel William Doughty and launch on 4 March 1819 on Monday at Washington Navy Yard the United States Ship Columbus 74.&quot;

==History==
Clearing Norfolk, Virginia, on 28 April 1820, &quot;Columbus&quot; served as flagship for Commodore William Bainbridge in the Mediterranean until returning to Boston on 23 July 1821.In 1824 enslaved seaman James Hutton through his attorney Francis Scott Key brought a freedom suit against Lt. William J. Belt, USN. Judge William Cranch of the District of Columbia Court, in his verdict, found that Lt. Belt by his action in enrolling James Hutton as an Ordinary Seaman aboard USS Columbus, and USS Spark (1813) was sufficient evidence of &quot;implied manumission&quot; and subsequently accorded Hutton his freedom. in reaching a decision, the court relied on muster rolls of both vessels and the letter of Commodore William Bainbridge dated 6 June 1825, see thumbnail. Serving as a receiving ship after 1833, she remained at Boston in ordinary until sailing to the Mediterranean on 29 August 1842, as flagship for Commodore Charles W. Morgan. On 24 February 1843, she sailed from Genoa, Italy, and reached Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on 29 July to become flagship of the Brazil Squadron, Commodore Daniel Turner. She returned to New York City on 27 May 1844 for repairs.

After embarking Commodore James Biddle, Commander, East India Squadron, she sailed on 4 June 1845 for Canton, China, where on 31 December Commodore Biddle exchanged ratified copies of the first American commercial treaty with China. &quot;Columbus&quot; remained there until April 1846, when she sailed for Japan to attempt opening that country to American commerce. She raised Uraga Channel on 19 July in company with , but achieved no success. Recalled at the outbreak of the Mexican–American War &quot;Columbus&quot; reached Valparaíso, Chile, in December and arrived off Monterey, California, 2 March 1847. Too large to be useful in the California operations, the ship sailed from San Francisco on 25 July for Norfolk, arriving on 3 March 1848.

In 1845 the writer, Charles Nordhoff joined the ship as a boy (aged 15), and served for 3 years. He would write later of his adventure in his book. &quot;Man-of-War Life: a Boy&#x27;s Experience in the U. S. Navy, largely autobiographical (Cincinnati, 1855)&quot;.

At Norfolk Navy Yard, &quot;Columbus&quot; lay in ordinary until 20 April 1861, when she was sunk by withdrawing Union forces to prevent her falling into Confederate hands.

<text>The National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) is a governing body which sets rules in drag racing and hosts events all over the United States and Canada. With over 40,000 drivers in its rosters, the NHRA claims to be the largest motorsport sanctioning body in the world.

The association was founded by Wally Parks in 1951 in California to provide a governing body to organize and promote the sport of drag racing. NHRA&#x27;s first Nationals was held in 1955, in Great Bend, Kansas. The NHRA Mission Foods Drag Racing Series, the national event series which comprises 24 races each year, is the premier series in drag racing that brings together the best drag racers from across North America and the world. The NHRA U.S. Nationals are now held at Lucas Oil Raceway in Brownsburg, Indiana and are officially called the U.S. Nationals. Winners of national events are awarded a trophy statue in honor of founder Wally Parks. The trophy is commonly referred to by its nickname, &quot;The Wally&quot;.

==History==
Wally Parks, editor of &quot;Hot Rod&quot; magazine and a dry lakes racer himself, began the National Hot Rod Association to promote &quot;safety, sportsmanship, and fellowship&quot; among hot rodders. The association gained about 25,000 members in its first year; within six years, it had more than 57,000 members.

&quot;Hot Rod&quot; magazine and NHRA worked together to convince the general public and especially the police that there was a difference between hot-rodders and reckless street racers, sometimes known as &quot;shot rodders&quot;. They encouraged the involvement of adults, such as auto shop teachers and garage owners. The NHRA&#x27;s efforts to defend the image of the hot-rodder included a series of short films such as &quot;The Cool Hot Rod&quot; (1953) in which a delinquent teen learns that &quot;a reckless kid in an old junker is not a hot-rodder at all. He&#x27;s a square.&quot;

NHRA initiated the 1954 &quot;Drag Safari&quot;, a nationwide tour to encourage organized drag racing with an emphasis on safety. Sponsored by Mobil Oil, the Safari crew would meet with law enforcement and local city officials at each stop to explain their program, involve local car clubs, set up sites, and run drag races. Drag Safari would lead to the 1955 US Nationals for drag racing.

Due to the coronavirus pandemic in the United States, the NHRA cancelled its 2020 and 2021 editions of the Drag Racing Series at the Virginia Motorsports Park. Regular scheduling resumed in 2022, with the events taking place in May of that year.

Currently, there are two headquarters offices, one in San Dimas, California, and the other in Brownsburg, Indiana at Lucas Oil Indianapolis Raceway Park. The Mission Foods Drag Racing Series offices are held in Brownsburg.

==Series==
===NHRA Championship Drag Racing Series===

The NHRA Mission Foods Drag Racing Series is the top division of the NHRA. It consists of four professional classes:

*Top Fuel Dragster
*Funny Car
*Pro Stock
*Pro Stock Motorcycle

====Champions====
*List of NHRA champions

===NHRA Sportsman Drag Racing Series===

There are more than a dozen Sportsman Classes. The classes contested at NHRA Divisional races include Snowmobile, Motorcycle Classes, Super Street, Super Gas, Stock Eliminator, Super Stock, Competition Eliminator, Super Comp, Top Sportsman, Top Dragster, Top Alcohol Funny Car, and Top Alcohol Dragster. All classes except Snowmobile and some Sportsman motorcycle classes are regularly contested at NHRA national events.

NHRA promotes mainly the Professional classes at national events; however, the majority of its participants are Sportsman Racers. Sportsman-class racers must be dues-paying members of NHRA before they are allowed to enter and participate in any NHRA event.

Included in these sportsman events are the Lucas Oil Drag Racing Series, the Summit Racing Equipment Racing Series and the NHRA Jr. Drag Racing League.

The NHRA Sportsman Drag Racing Series originally consisted of seven divisions: Northeast, Southeast, North Central, South Central, West Central, Northwest, and Pacific. Starting in 2012, the Top Alcohol Dragster and Top Alcohol Funny Car classes competed in four regions: East, North Central, Central and West.

=== National Records ===

&quot;NOTE: Top Fuel and Funny Car records are measured in the 1,000 foot (304.8 meter) increment&quot;

==Venues==

NHRA has over 100 member tracks across the United States. It currently leases In N Out Pomona Dragstrip, Gainesville Raceway and Lucas Oil Raceway. It previously owned National Trail Raceway and Atlanta Dragway

==Safety==
The NHRA mandates numerous safety devices and procedures in all competition events.

A five-point safety harness is required for all vehicles. It holds the driver securely in the seat and is equipped with a quick-release latch which can be released in less than a second should the driver need to leave the car due to fire or explosions.

Fire suits are required for all drivers in the alcohol and nitromethane fuel classes and the faster gasoline classes. These suits are full body coveralls and made with seven layers of Nomex fabric, which makes them resistant to fire. The required suit includes Nomex gloves, foot socks, and head sock.

Another NASCAR transplant, which was brought into use after the death of Fireball Roberts, was the fuel cell. This bladder is placed into the fuel tanks of non-nitromethane-fueled vehicles to prevent fuel leaks and explosions.

Third is the use of the HANS device. This device limits the movement of the head and neck in the event of an impact.

Fourth is the titanium shield that must be placed behind the head of all Dragsters and Funny Cars down to the Alcohol ranks. This is to prevent any debris from entering the cockpit and becoming a missile hazard to the driver after the death of Top Fuel racer Darrell Russell.

Fifth is the on-board fire extinguishing system that is required. These systems are directed onto the engine itself and are activated instantly when the engine catches fire, reducing the chance for the car to completely catch fire and endanger the driver. The driver also has a manual activation control available. This has been in place on all cars since 1983, when an engine explosion and fire came very close to killing then-Funny Car driver Mike Dunn. All enclosed body cars must have a five-inch circular opening that will accept the nozzle of a fire extinguisher triggered by safety personnel. All vehicles must have a clearly marked fuel pump cut-off switch on a rear panel, accessible to safety crews.

Sixth is the roof escape hatch that is in place on all Funny Cars since the founding of the division in the early 1970s. This device allows Funny Car drivers a safe means of exit during an engine fire rather than falling out of the car between the frame and fiberglass body, and possibly running the risk of being run over by the rear tires.

Seventh are the long bars at the rear end of all cars, also known as &quot;wheelie bars&quot;. These long struts prevent the car from flipping over during the launch phase.

To prevent debris, oil, fuel, or coolant from falling on the racing surface, &quot;diapers&quot; under the engine (with a supporting platform) are used to retain liquids and broken parts in the event of a catastrophic engine failure. &quot;Oil-downs&quot; result in substantial fines and the loss of previously earned Championship points (for annual awards). Many cars using the centrifugally-activated &quot;slipper&quot; clutch are now using a retention tube to collect the substantial amount of clutch dust that is produced during each race. The aforementioned recent practices, along with the longstanding requirement for a Kevlar-style retainer blanket over the supercharger, considerably reduce the potential for injury and fire, in addition to assuring a cleaner and safer racing surface, resulting in a dramatic reduction in race delays for track clean-up.

The rear tires of the car, which are called &quot;slicks&quot; due to the fact that there is no tread on them, are specified with safety considerations in mind. These tires are made from a much harder compound than in previous years so that the tire is resistant to disintegration. This also came about after the death of Russell. The tires are not allowed to be inflated under for any race at any time.

All cars capable of attaining 150 miles per hour require braking parachutes. A safety requirement on all Drag cars running 9.99 and quicker in the 1/4 mile is the fireproof engine blanket that surrounds the engine block and contains debris in case of an engine explosion. NHRA rules call for a monetary, points, and time penalty if the car leaks oil during the run. During qualifying, the offending team loses its elapsed time and speed from the run; during a race, the penalty is loss of lane choice unless both teams in the ensuing race committed the violation.

In the wake of Eric Medlen&#x27;s 2007 death, the roll bars in a Funny Car underwent modifications to further improve safety. They are padded with thick insulation and coated with several layers of Nomex to prevent the padding from catching fire during an engine explosion.

Another facility safety feature is the large sand pit at the end of the track past an area of the track known as the &quot;shutdown area&quot;, also known as a &quot;sand trap&quot;. This sand pit has been placed to slow or stop a car. In the wake of Scott Kalitta&#x27;s death at Englishtown, NJ in 2008, the sand traps have been made longer and deeper, going from three feet deep to six feet deep and from long to long. Anchors for any arresting netting must be buried underground with no obstructing posts.

Some of the newest safety features deal with the tracks themselves. In the wake of Kalitta&#x27;s death, there are now heavily padded retaining walls at the end of the sand traps. These walls are able to withstand the impact of a vehicle traveling at well over the usual speed of any division within the NHRA&#x27;s professional categories. These retaining walls take the place of the old rubber polymer safety nets that were once held up with concrete posts.

Another safety modification was a direct result of Kalitta&#x27;s death. The NHRA began installing a sensor that constantly checks the car&#x27;s engine, and should the car backfire at any time during the race, or if the burst panel is blown out by an engine explosion, the fuel pump shuts off and the parachutes are deployed automatically. Although several drivers in the Top Fuel and Funny Car divisions have stated their dislike for the new sensor, they do admit that it should cut down on any fatal crashes similar to Kalitta&#x27;s. This device was developed by Force, Kenny Bernstein, and Tony Schumacher, along with NHRA racing development, and NHRA track safety. It was implemented at the start of the 2009 season. The sensor is used only in the Funny Car and Top Fuel divisions. Pro Stock doesn&#x27;t use nitromethane or superchargers in their engines and this presents a much-reduced risk of the massive explosions that can be seen in the nitromethane-fueled cars—and often at their peak speeds.

Prior to the late 1980s, fans could station themselves up to the guardrails so they could be closer to the action. However, in the wake of several rather dramatic accidents on track, where spectators have been injured or killed, fans are no longer allowed within of the guardrail.

One of the newest safety requirements came after a near-fatal crash at Texas Motorplex in Ennis, Texas, when John Force&#x27;s car experienced a severe case of tire shake which, coupled with the release of his parachutes, ripped his car cleanly in two directly behind the engine. This frame failure exposed him to severe injury with no body or frame in front of his feet, as the severely damaged vehicle ground to a halt. The rules now prevent the use of hardened chrome moly tubing in the framework construction of any Top Fuel or Funny Car.

The track length for nitromethane-powered vehicles (funny cars and fuel dragsters) has been reduced to 1,000 feet (305 meters), to reduce the likelihood and severity of blower and engine explosions and fires at or above 200 miles per hour. All other classes continue to race a full 1320-foot quarter mile (402 meters) which has been the original distance established by the NHRA in the 1950s.

The 2010 season brought a new safety device to Top Fuel classes. Should the driver be rendered unable to perform the normal shutdown sequence at the conclusion of a run, a pair of redundant transmitters, placed and past the finish line, will signal an on-board receiver to automatically shut off ignition power and fuel to the engine and deploy the parachutes. The transmitters are designed and placed so as to avoid inadvertent triggering of the automated shutoffs. These transmitters and the receivers that are placed on all cars were designed by NHRA&#x27;s Track Safety Committee and constructed by Electrimotion, and are a direct result of Kalitta&#x27;s death.

===Safety Safari===
Within the safety requirements, there is also a full crew of safety personnel, called the &quot;Safety Safari&quot;, whose job is to attend to any fires, clean up the track of debris after an accident on the track, and attend to the drivers prior to the arrival of any medical personnel. The Safety Safari has been in place since the late 1960s, after a rash of on-track accidents caused several promising drivers to retire early. Since that time the chance of fatal injuries has been decreased but not eliminated. There is also a full staff of EMTs on hand at any event on the schedule at any given time. These EMTs are usually from the city or county the track is located in, and are compensated by the NHRA for their time and efforts. Aeromedical services are also on hand at the track for airlifting severely injured persons to local hospitals or trauma centers if necessary.

The original &quot;Drag Safari&quot; began their tour across America in 1954. Included were four original members: Bud Coons, Bud Evans, Eric Rickman and Chic Cannon.

===Fatalities===

Although there are several safety procedures in place to prevent fatal accidents, no amount of safety can completely prevent fatalities on the track. These are notable incidents that took place at NHRA national events or in pre or post race testing after national events.

<text>The Royal Armouries is the United Kingdom&#x27;s national collection of arms and armour. Once an important part of England&#x27;s military organization, it became the United Kingdom&#x27;s oldest museum, and one of the oldest museums in the world. It is also one of the largest collections of arms and armour in the world, comprising the UK&#x27;s National Collection of Arms and Armour, National Artillery Collection, and National Firearms Collection. Originally housed in the Tower of London from the 15th century, today the collection is split across three sites: the Tower, the Royal Armouries Museum in Leeds, and Fort Nelson near Portsmouth.

From 2004 to 2015, a limited selection of items was also on display in Louisville, Kentucky, in the United States, in cooperation with the Frazier History Museum.

==History==
The Royal Armouries is one of the ancient institutions of the Tower of London and was originally engaged in the manufacture of armour for the Kings of England and their armies. The Office of the Armoury grew out of the department known as the King&#x27;s Privy Wardrobe at the Tower of London in the mid-15th century. Overseen from 1423 by the Master of the King&#x27;s Armour, and based in the White Tower, the Office was responsible for manufacturing armour and edged weapons for the monarch and his armies; it functioned alongside the Office of Ordnance, which had responsibility for firearms.

The Armoury oversaw storehouses and workshops at Woolwich and Portsmouth, and at various royal palaces (most notably the Greenwich Armoury, which specialized in richly decorated ceremonial armour). In 1545, it is recorded that a visiting foreign dignitary paid to view the Armoury collection at the Tower of London. By the time of Charles II, there was a permanent public display there; the &quot;Spanish Armoury&quot; which included instruments of torture and the &quot;Line of Kings&quot;—a row of wooden effigies representing the kings of England. This makes it the first museum in Britain. 
The influence of the Armoury began to wane as traditional weapons gave way increasingly to firearms in the field of war. In the 1620s, swords, lances and items of armour were still used in battle, but for the most part were being issued by the Office of Ordnance (which was becoming a sizeable department of State) rather than by the Armoury. The latter, however, remained staffed and operational until 1671, when it was finally absorbed by the Ordnance Board; the board continued to maintain, and indeed expanded, the Armoury as a museum.

The Tower was engaged in the development, manufacture and storage of a wide variety of weaponry until the Board of Ordnance was abolished in 1855. Thereafter the historic armoury collection remained. Only a small part of this could be displayed, however, and in 1995, much of the artillery collection was moved to Fort Nelson in Hampshire and the following year a new Royal Armouries Museum was opened in Leeds. The remaining part of the collection relates directly to the Tower.

The National Heritage Act 1983 established the Armouries as a non-departmental public body, now sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.

==Master of the Armouries==

The head of the Royal Armouries is known as the Master of the Armouries. This was an ancient office that was revived in 1935 when the Royal Armouries became a national museum. The current Director General and Master of the Armouries is Nat Edwards.
===Master of the Armoury===
The Master of the Armoury was responsible for maintaining a store of armour and weapons for use in the event of war and had an office in the Tower of London. The first use of the title was in 1462.

<doc id="227458" wikidata="Q335232" url="?curid=227458" title="E. L. Doctorow">
<text>Edgar Lawrence Doctorow (January 6, 1931 – July 21, 2015) was an American novelist, editor, and professor, best known for his works of historical fiction.

He wrote twelve novels, three volumes of short fiction and a stage drama, including the award-winning novels &quot;Ragtime&quot; (1975), &quot;Billy Bathgate&quot; (1989), and &quot;The March&quot; (2005). These, like many of his other works, placed fictional characters in recognizable historical contexts, with known historical figures, and often used different narrative styles. His stories were recognized for their originality and versatility, and Doctorow was praised for his audacity and imagination.

A number of Doctorow&#x27;s novels and short stories were also adapted for the screen, including &quot;Welcome to Hard Times&quot; (1967) starring Henry Fonda, &quot;Daniel&quot; (1983) starring Timothy Hutton, &quot;Billy Bathgate&quot; (1991) starring Dustin Hoffman, and &quot;Wakefield&quot; (2016) starring Bryan Cranston. His most notable adaptations were for the film &quot;Ragtime&quot; (1981) and the Broadway musical of the same name (1998), which won four Tony Awards.

Doctorow was the recipient of numerous writing awards, including the National Book Critics Circle Award which he was awarded three different times (for &quot;Ragtime&quot;, &quot;Billy Bathgate&quot;, and &quot;The March&quot;). At the time of his death, President Barack Obama called him &quot;one of America&#x27;s greatest novelists&quot;.

==Early life==
Doctorow was born January 6, 1931, in the Bronx, the son of Rose (Levine) and David Richard Doctorow, second-generation Americans of Russian Jewish extraction who named him after Edgar Allan Poe. His father ran a small music shop. He attended city public grade schools and the Bronx High School of Science where, surrounded by mathematically gifted children, he fled to the office of the school literary magazine, &quot;Dynamo,&quot; which published his first literary effort. He then enrolled in a journalism class to increase his opportunities to write.

Doctorow attended Kenyon College in Ohio, where he studied with John Crowe Ransom, acted in college theater productions and majored in philosophy. While at Kenyon College, Doctorow joined the Middle Kenyon Association, and befriended Richard H. Collin. After graduating with honors in 1952, he completed a year of graduate work in English drama at Columbia University before being drafted into the U.S. Army during the Korean War. In 1954 and 1955, he served as a corporal in the Signal Corps in West Germany.

Back in New York after military service, Doctorow worked as a reader for a motion picture company. Reading so many Westerns inspired his first novel, &quot;Welcome to Hard Times&quot;. Begun as a parody of western fiction, it evolved into a reclamation of the genre. It was published to positive reviews in 1960, with Wirt Williams of &quot;The New York Times&quot; describing it as &quot;taut and dramatic, exciting and successfully symbolic.&quot;

When asked how he decided to become a writer, he said, &quot;I was a child who read everything I could get my hands on. Eventually, I asked of a story not only what was to happen next, but how is this done? How am I made to live from words on a page? And so I became a writer.&quot;

==Career==
To support his family, Doctorow spent nine years as a book editor, first at New American Library working with Ian Fleming and Ayn Rand among others; and from 1964, as editor-in-chief at Dial Press, publishing work by James Baldwin, Norman Mailer, Ernest J. Gaines, and William Kennedy, among others. During this time he published his second novel &quot;Big As Life&quot; (1966), which Doctorow has, subsequently, not allowed to be republished.

In 1969, Doctorow left publishing to pursue a writing career. He accepted a position as Visiting Writer at the University of California, Irvine, where he completed &quot;The Book of Daniel&quot; (1971), a freely fictionalized consideration of the trial and execution of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg for giving nuclear secrets to the Soviet Union during the Cold War. It was widely acclaimed, called a &quot;masterpiece&quot; by &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and said by &quot;The New York Times&quot; to launch the author into &quot;the first rank of American writers&quot; according to Christopher Lehmann-Haupt.

Doctorow&#x27;s next book, written in his home in New Rochelle, New York, was &quot;Ragtime&quot; (1975), later named one of the 100 best novels of the 20th century by the Modern Library editorial board. His subsequent work includes the award-winning novels &quot;World&#x27;s Fair&quot; (1985), &quot;Billy Bathgate&quot; (1989), and &quot;The March&quot; (2005), as well as several volumes of essays and short fiction.

Novelist Jay Parini is impressed by Doctorow&#x27;s skill at writing fictionalized history in a unique style, &quot;a kind of detached but arresting presentation of history that mingled real characters with fictional ones in ways that became his signature manner&quot;. In &quot;Ragtime&quot;, for example, he arranges the story to include Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung sharing a ride at Coney Island, or a setting with Henry Ford and J. P. Morgan.

Despite the immense research Doctorow needed to create stories based on real events and real characters, reviewer John Brooks notes that they were nevertheless &quot;alive enough never to smell the research in old newspaper files that they must have required&quot;. Doctorow demonstrated in most of his novels &quot;that the past is very much alive, but that it&#x27;s not easily accessed,&quot; writes Parini. &quot;We tell and retell stories, and these stories illuminate our daily lives. He showed us again and again that our past is our present, and that those not willing to grapple with &#x27;what happened&#x27; will be condemned to repeat its worst errors.&quot;

==Personal life and death==
In 1954, Doctorow married fellow Columbia University student Helen Esther Setzer while serving in the U.S. Army in West Germany. The couple had three children.

Doctorow also taught at Sarah Lawrence College, the Yale School of Drama, the University of Utah, the University of California, Irvine, and Princeton University. He was the Loretta and Lewis Glucksman Professor of English and American Letters at New York University. In 2001, he donated his papers to the Fales Library of New York University. In the opinion of the library&#x27;s director, Marvin Taylor, Doctorow was &quot;one of the most important American novelists of the 20th century&quot;.

Doctorow died of lung cancer on July 21, 2015, aged 84, in Manhattan. He is interred in Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx.

<text>Henry Mintzberg is a Canadian academic and author on business and management. He is currently the Cleghorn Professor of Management Studies at the Desautels Faculty of Management of McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, where he has been teaching since 1968.

==Early life==
Mintzberg was born on September 2, 1939, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. He is the son of Jewish parents Myer and Irene (Wexler) Mintzberg. His father, Myer Mintzberg, was a manufacturer. 

== Education ==
Henry Mintzberg completed his first undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering at McGill University in 1961. During his time at McGill University he was in two honor societies, was a student council representative, a &quot;McGill Daily&quot; sports editor, a student athletic council chairman, and more. 

Mintzberg then went on to complete his second undergraduate degree in 1962. This degree was a Bachelor of General Arts and he received it from Sir George Williams University, which is now known as Concordia University.

He then completes his Master&#x27;s degree in Management at MIT Sloan School of Management in 1965. During his studies he was a part of the student government and won the Quebec Fellowship award as well as the M.I.T. Fellowship award.

To finish up his education, Mintzberg returned to Sloan School of Management at M.I.T. and completed his Ph.D. in 1968. He successfully defended his thesis of &quot;The Manager at Work—Determining his Activities, Roles and Programs by Structured Observation&quot; and studied the fields of Policy (major), Organizational Studies, Information and Control Systems, and minor in Political Science. During his time he also received the Ford Fellowship as well as the M.I.T. Fellowship awards.

== Personal life ==
Henry is married to Dulcie Mintzberg and has two children, Susie and Lisa. He also has three grandchildren, Laura, Tomas, and Maya.

Henry Mintzberg likes to write short stories about his personal life experiences and wants to publish them one day. Mintzberg also likes to collect beaver sculptures, and he shares pictures of his collection on his personal website. 

== Career ==
From 1991 to 1999, Mintzberg was a visiting professor at INSEAD.

In 2004, he published a book entitled &quot;Managers Not MBAs&quot;, which outlines what he believes to be wrong with management education today. Mintzberg claims that prestigious graduate management schools like Harvard Business School and the Wharton Business School at the University of Pennsylvania are obsessed with numbers and that their overzealous attempts to make management a science are damaging the discipline of management. Mintzberg advocates more emphasis on post graduate programs that educate practicing managers (rather than students with little real world experience) by relying upon action learning and insights from their own problems and experiences.

Mintzberg has twice won the McKinsey Award for publishing the best article in the &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot; (despite his critical stance about the strategy consulting business). He is also credited with co-creating the organigraph, which is taught in business schools.

Mintzberg writes on the topics of management and business strategy, with more than 150 articles and fifteen books to his name. His seminal book, &quot;The Rise and Fall of Strategic Planning&quot;, criticizes some of the practices of strategic planning today.

Mintzberg runs two programs at the Desautels Faculty of Management which have been designed to teach his alternative approach to management and strategic planning: the International Masters in Practicing Management (IMPM) in association with the McGill Executive Institute and the International Masters for Health Leadership (IMHL). With Phil LeNir, he owns Coaching Ourselves International, a private company using his alternative approach for management development directly in the workplace.

In 1997, Dr. Mintzberg was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. In 1998 he was made an Officer of the National Order of Quebec. He is now a member of the Strategic Management Society. During his time as a professor, Dr. Mintzberg has supervised 22 doctoral programs, has been on committee for 14 doctoral programs, and has received a large number of awards both for his work as a professor as well as his work on organizational theory.

== Contribution to organization theory ==

The organizational configurations framework of Mintzberg is a model that describes six valid organizational configurations (originally only five; the sixth one was added later):
# Simple structure, characteristic of entrepreneurial organization
# Machine bureaucracy
# Professional bureaucracy
# Diversified form
# Adhocracy, or innovative organization
# Missionary organization, or idealistic organization

Regarding the between different tasks, Mintzberg defines the following mechanisms:

# &quot;Mutual adjustment&quot;, which achieves coordination by the simple process of informal communication (as between two operating employees)
# &quot;Direct supervision&quot; is achieved by having one person issue orders or instructions to several others whose work interrelates (as when a boss tells others what is to be done, one step at a time)
# &quot;Standardization of work processes&quot;, which achieves coordination by specifying the work processes of people carrying out interrelated tasks (those standards usually being developed in the technostructure to be carried out in the operating core, as in the case of the work instructions that come out of time-and-motion studies)
# &quot;Standardization of outputs&quot;, which achieves coordination by specifying the results of different work (again usually developed in the technostructure, as in a financial plan that specifies subunit performance targets or specifications that outline the dimensions of a product to be produced)
# &quot;Standardization of skills&quot; (as well as knowledge), in which different work is coordinated by virtue of the related training the workers have received (as in medical specialists—say a surgeon and an anesthetist in an operating room—responding almost automatically to each other&#x27;s standardized procedures)
# &quot;Standardization of norms&quot;, in which it is the norms infusing the work that are controlled, usually for the entire organization, so that everyone functions according to the same set of beliefs (as in a religious order)

According to the organizational configurations model of Mintzberg, each organization can consist of a maximum of six basic parts:
# Strategic apex (top management)
# Middle line (middle management)
# Operating core (operations, operational processes)
# Technostructure (analysts that design systems, processes, etc.)
# Support staff (support outside of operating workflow)
# Ideology (halo of beliefs and traditions; norms, values, culture)

== Contribution to business strategy theory ==
Perhaps the most distinctive feature of Mintzberg&#x27;s research findings and writing on business strategy, is that they have often emphasized the importance of emergent strategy, which arises informally at any level in an organisation, as an alternative or a complement to deliberate strategy, which is determined consciously either by top management or with the acquiescence of top management. He has been strongly critical of the stream of strategy literature which focuses predominantly on deliberate strategy, and refers to &quot;strategic planning&quot; as an oxymoron.

<text>John Peter Gabriel Muhlenberg (October 1, 1746October 1, 1807) was an American clergyman and military officer who served during the American Revolutionary War. A member of Pennsylvania&#x27;s prominent Muhlenberg family political dynasty, he became a respected figure in the newly independent United States as a Lutheran minister and member of the United States House of Representatives and United States Senate.

==Early life and education==
Muhlenberg was born October 1, 1746, in Trappe in the Province of Pennsylvania to Anna Maria Weiser, the daughter of Pennsylvania Dutch pioneer and diplomat Conrad Weiser, and Henry Muhlenberg a German Lutheran pastor.

In 1763, along with his brothers, Frederick Augustus and Gotthilf Henry Ernst, he was sent to Halle, where they were educated in Latin at the Francke Foundations. In 1767, he left school to begin his career as a sales assistant in Lübeck, but returned the same year to Pennsylvania.

==Career==

He briefly served in the British Army&#x27;s 60th Regiment of Foot, and also served for a short while in the German dragoons, earning the nickname &quot;Teufel Piet&quot; (Devil Pete) before returning to Philadelphia in 1767, where he was given a classical education from the Academy of Philadelphia (the modern University of Pennsylvania). He was ordained in 1768 and headed a Lutheran congregation in Bedminster, New Jersey, before moving to Woodstock, Virginia.

Muhlenberg visited England in 1772 and was ordained into the priesthood of the Anglican Church, although he served a Lutheran congregation. Since the Anglican Church was the state church of Virginia, he was required to be ordained in an Anglican church in order to serve a congregation in Virginia. Besides his new congregation, he led the Committee of Safety and Correspondence for Dunmore County, Virginia. He was elected to the House of Burgesses in 1774, and was a delegate to the First Virginia Convention. He owned slaves.

===Military career===

After the American Revolutionary War broke out in 1775, the Continental Army was formed. Muhlenberg was authorized to raise and command the 8th Virginia Regiment of the Continental Army&#x27;s Virginia Line as its colonel. He was very likely chosen due to his influence in the German-American community. Of the eight colonels in the Virginia Line, Muhlenberg was the youngest at 29 and only Patrick Henry had less military experience.

According to a biography written by his great-nephew in the mid-19th century, on January 21, 1776, in the Lutheran church in Woodstock, Virginia, Muhlenberg took his sermon text from the third chapter Ecclesiastes, which starts with &quot;To every thing there is a season...&quot;; after reading the eighth verse, &quot;a time of war, and a time of peace,&quot; he declared, &quot;And this is the time of war,&quot; removing his clerical robe to reveal his Colonel&#x27;s uniform. Outside the church door the drums began to roll as men turned to kiss their wives and then walked down the aisle to enlist, and within half an hour, 162 men were enrolled. The next day he led out 300 men from the county to form the nucleus of the 8th Virginia Regiment. Though it is accepted that Muhlenberg helped form and lead the 8th, historians doubt the account of the sermon, as there are no reports prior to Muhlenberg&#x27;s great-nephew&#x27;s biography.

Muhlenberg&#x27;s unit was first posted to the South, to defend the coast of South Carolina and Georgia. In early 1777, the Eighth Regiment was sent north to join Washington&#x27;s main army. Muhlenberg was made a brigadier general of the Virginia Line and commanded that Brigade in Nathanael Greene&#x27;s division at Valley Forge. Muhlenberg&#x27;s Headquarters&#x27;, assigned by Washington during the 1777-1778 Winter Encampment at Valley Forge, is now known as the Moore-Irwin House in King of Prussia, PA, and was also the estate Washington wrote in his diary of visiting with other Founding Fathers Gouverneur Morris and Robert Morris during a rare break in the 1787 Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia. Muhlenberg saw service in the Battles of Brandywine, Germantown, and Monmouth. After Monmouth, most of the Virginia Line was sent to the far south, while General Muhlenberg was assigned to head up the defense of Virginia using mainly militia units.

At the Battle of Yorktown, he commanded the first brigade in Lafayette&#x27;s Light Division. His brigade was part of the Corps of Light Infantry, consisting of the light infantry companies of the line regiments of Massachusetts (ten companies), Connecticut (five companies), New Hampshire (five companies), and Rhode Island and New Jersey (one each). They held the right flank and manned the two trenches built to move American cannons closer to Cornwallis&#x27; defenses. The battalion commanded by American Lt. Colonel Alexander Hamilton and French Lieutenant Colonel Jean-Joseph Sourbader de Gimat led the night bayonet attack that stormed Redoubt No. 10 on October 14, 1781.

At the end of the war (1783), he was brevetted to major general and settled in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania.

Muhlenberg was also an original member of the Pennsylvania Society of the Cincinnati.

===Political career===
After the war, Muhlenberg was elected to the Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1784. He was elected Vice-President of the Council, a position comparable to that of Lieutenant Governor, on October 31, 1787. His term as Vice-President ended on a mysterious note. On October 14, 1788, the minutes of the Executive Council report that Muhlenberg had left Philadelphia without tendering his resignation—why his resignation was needed or expected is not noted—so a messenger was sent after him. That night, after the messenger returned with the resignation, the Council met at President Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s home to choose Muhlenberg&#x27;s successor, electing David Redick to the position.

Muhlenberg was elected to the 1st Congress (1789–1791) and 3rd Congress (1793–1795) as one of the at-large representatives from Pennsylvania. His brother Frederick was the Speaker of the House for that same Congress. He was the first founder of the Democratic-Republican Societies in 1793. Muhlenberg served in Congress as a Republican during the 5th Congress 1799–1801 for the 4th district, previously running for this district in 1796. He was the Anti-Administration nominee in the 1795 United States Senate election in Pennsylvania. Muhlenberg was elected by the legislature to the U.S. Senate on a second ballot in February 1801 over George Logan, but resigned on June 30 of that same year.

President Thomas Jefferson appointed him the supervisor of revenue for Pennsylvania in 1801 and customs collector for Philadelphia in 1802. He served in the latter post until his death.

On August 3, 1805, Muhlenberg wrote a letter to the residents of the primarily-German Northampton and Berks counties in a successful attempt to tilt those counties toward incumbent Governor Thomas McKean, who, in the midst of a badly fractured state Republican Party, was running with Federalist support, in his bid for reelection. Muhlenberg noted that although McKean&#x27;s opponent, Simon Snyder, was of German descent, his election would elevate the Republican Party&#x27;s radical Democratic faction to power and, with calls for a Constitutional Convention to elevate the power of the state legislature over the governor and especially the judiciary, result in anarchy. McKean&#x27;s margin of victory, 6,772-3,216, over Snyder in Northampton and Berks secured his narrow, 43,644-38,483, statewide margin of victory over Snyder.

==Personal life==
On November 6, 1770, he married Anna Barbara &quot;Hannah&quot; Meyer, the daughter of a successful potter. Together they had six children, including:

* Francis Swaine Muhlenberg (1795–1831), a U.S. Representative from Ohio who married Mary Barr Denny (1806–1893) in 1831, shortly before his death in December 1831. After his death, Francis&#x27; widow married Richard Hubbell Hopkins.

On his 61st birthday, Muhlenberg died in Gray&#x27;s Ferry, Pennsylvania, on October 1, 1807, and is buried at the Augustus Lutheran Church in Trappe, Pennsylvania.

<doc id="227478" wikidata="Q193838" url="?curid=227478" title="Germination">
<text>Germination is the process by which an organism grows from a seed or spore. The term is applied to the sprouting of a seedling from a seed of an angiosperm or gymnosperm, the growth of a sporeling from a spore, such as the spores of fungi, ferns, bacteria, and the growth of the pollen tube from the pollen grain of a seed plant.

== Seed plants ==

Germination is usually the growth of a plant contained within a seed resulting in the formation of the seedling. It is also the process of reactivation of metabolic machinery of the seed resulting in the emergence of radicle and plumule. The seed of a vascular plant is a small package produced in a fruit or cone after the union of male and female reproductive cells. All fully developed seeds contain an embryo and, in most plant species some store of food reserves, wrapped in a seed coat. Dormant seeds are viable seeds that do not germinate because they require specific internal or environmental stimuli to resume growth. Under proper conditions, the seed begins to germinate and the embryo resumes growth, developing into a seedling.

Disturbance of soil can result in vigorous plant growth by exposing seeds already in the soil to changes in environmental factors where germination may have previously been inhibited by depth of the seeds or soil that was too compact. This is often observed at gravesites after a burial.

Seed germination depends on both internal and external conditions. The most important external factors include right temperature, water, oxygen or air and sometimes light or darkness. Various plants require different variables for successful seed germination. Often this depends on the individual seed variety and is closely linked to the ecological conditions of a plant&#x27;s natural habitat. For some seeds, their future germination response is affected by environmental conditions during seed formation; most often these responses are types of seed dormancy.
* Water is required for germination. Mature seeds are often extremely dry and need to take in significant amounts of water, relative to the dry weight of the seed, before cellular metabolism and growth can resume. Most seeds need enough water to moisten the seeds but not enough to soak them. The uptake of water by seeds is called imbibition, which leads to the swelling and the breaking of the seed coat. When seeds are formed, most plants store a food reserve with the seed, such as starch, proteins, or oils. This food reserve provides nourishment to the growing embryo. When the seed imbibes water, hydrolytic enzymes are activated which break down these stored food resources into metabolically useful chemicals. After the seedling emerges from the seed coat and starts growing roots and leaves, the seedling&#x27;s food reserves are typically exhausted; at this point photosynthesis provides the energy needed for continued growth and the seedling now requires a continuous supply of water, nutrients, and light.
* Oxygen is required by the germinating seed for metabolism. Oxygen is used in aerobic respiration, the main source of the seedling&#x27;s energy until it grows leaves. Oxygen is an atmospheric gas that is found in soil pore spaces; if a seed is buried too deeply within the soil or the soil is waterlogged, the seed can be oxygen starved. Some seeds have impermeable seed coats that prevent oxygen from entering the seed, causing a type of physical dormancy which is broken when the seed coat is worn away enough to allow gas exchange and water uptake from the environment.
** In a small number of plants, such as rice, anaerobic germination can occur in waterlogged conditions. The seed produces a hollow coleoptile that acts like a &#x27;snorkel&#x27;, providing the seed with access to oxygen.
* Temperature affects cellular metabolic and growth rates. Seeds from different species and even seeds from the same plant germinate over a wide range of temperatures. Seeds often have a temperature range within which they will germinate, and they will not do so above or below this range. Many seeds germinate at temperatures slightly above 60-75 F (16–24 C) [room-temperature in centrally heated houses], while others germinate just above freezing and others germinate only in response to alternations in temperature between warm and cool. Some seeds germinate when the soil is cool 28–40 F (-2 - 4 C), and some when the soil is warm 76-90 F (24–32 C). Some seeds require exposure to cold temperatures (vernalization) to break dormancy. Some seeds in a dormant state will not germinate even if conditions are favorable. Seeds that are dependent on temperature to end dormancy have a type of physiological dormancy. For example, seeds requiring the cold of winter are inhibited from germinating until they take in water in the fall and experience cooler temperatures. Cold stratification is a process that induces the dormancy breaking prior to light emission that promotes germination . Four degrees Celsius is cool enough to end dormancy for most cool dormant seeds, but some groups, especially within the family Ranunculaceae and others, need conditions cooler than -5 C. Some seeds will only germinate after hot temperatures during a forest fire which cracks their seed coats; this is a type of physical dormancy.
Most common annual vegetables have optimal germination temperatures between 75–90 F (24–32 C), though many species (e.g. radishes or spinach) can germinate at significantly lower temperatures, as low as 40 F (4 C), thus allowing them to be grown from seeds in cooler climates. Suboptimal temperatures lead to lower success rates and longer germination periods.
* Light or darkness can be an environmental trigger for germination and is a type of physiological dormancy. Most seeds are not affected by light or darkness, but many photoblastic seeds, including species found in forest settings, will not germinate until an opening in the canopy allows sufficient light for the growth of the seedling.
* Scarification mimics natural processes that weaken the seed coat before germination. In nature, some seeds require particular conditions to germinate, such as the heat of a fire (e.g., many Australian native plants), or soaking in a body of water for a long period of time. Others need to be passed through an animal&#x27;s digestive tract to weaken the seed coat enough to allow the seedling to emerge.
=== Dormancy ===
Some live seeds are dormant and need more time, and/or need to be subjected to specific environmental conditions before they will germinate. Seed dormancy can originate in different parts of the seed, for example, within the embryo; in other cases the seed coat is involved. Dormancy breaking often involves changes in membranes, initiated by dormancy-breaking signals. This generally occurs only within hydrated seeds. Factors affecting seed dormancy include the presence of certain plant hormones, notably abscisic acid, which inhibits germination, and gibberellin, which ends seed dormancy. In brewing, barley seeds are treated with gibberellin to ensure uniform seed germination for the production of barley malt.

=== Seedling establishment ===
In some definitions, the appearance of the radicle marks the end of germination and the beginning of &quot;establishment&quot;, a period that utilizes the food reserves stored in the seed. Germination and establishment as an independent organism are critical phases in the life of a plant when they are the most vulnerable to injury, disease, and water stress. The germination index can be used as an indicator of phytotoxicity in soils. The mortality between dispersal of seeds and completion of the establishment can be so high that many species have adapted to produce large numbers of seeds.

== Germination rate and germination capacity ==
In agriculture and gardening, the germination rate describes how many seeds of a particular plant species, variety or seedlot are likely to germinate over a given period. It is a measure of germination time course and is usually expressed as a percentage, e.g., an 85% germination rate indicates that about 85 out of 100 seeds will probably germinate under proper conditions over the germination period given. Seed germination rate is determined by the seed genetic composition, morphological features and environmental factors. The germination rate is useful for calculating the number of seeds needed for a given area or desired number of plants. For seed physiologists and seed scientists &quot;germination rate&quot; is the reciprocal of time taken for the process of germination to complete starting from time of sowing. On the other hand, the number of seed able to complete germination in a population (i.e. seed lot) is referred to as germination capacity.

Soil salinity is one of the stress factors that can limit the germination rate. Environmental stress activates some stress-related activities [CuZn-superoxide dismutase (SOD), Mn-SOD, L-ascorbate oxidase (AO), DNA polymerase Delta 1 (POLD)-1, Chaperon (CHAPE) and heat shock protein (HSP)-21], genetic template stability and photosynthetic pigment activation. Application of exogenic glutamine limiting this process. Research carried out on onion seeds shows a reduction in the mean germination time, an increase in the coefficient of germination velocity, the germination index and germination percentage after administration of exogenous glutamine to plants. 

===Repair of DNA damage===

Seed quality deteriorates with age, and this is associated with accumulation of genome damage. During germination, repair processes are activated to deal with accumulated DNA damage. In particular, single- and double-strand breaks in DNA can be repaired. The DNA damage checkpoint kinase ATM has a major role in integrating progression through germination with repair responses to the DNA damages accumulated by the aged seed.

=== Dicot germination ===
The part of the plant that first emerges from the seed is the embryonic root, termed the radicle or primary root. It allows the seedling to become anchored in the ground and start absorbing water. After the root absorbs water, an embryonic shoot emerges from the seed. This shoot comprises three main parts: the cotyledons (seed leaves), the section of shoot below the cotyledons (hypocotyl), and the section of shoot above the cotyledons (epicotyl). The way the shoot emerges differs among plant groups.

==== Epigeal ====
Epigeal germination (or epigeous germination) is a botanical term indicating that the germination takes place above the ground. In epigeal germination, the &quot;hypocotyl&quot; elongates and forms a hook, pulling rather than pushing the cotyledons and apical meristem through the soil. Once it reaches the surface, it straightens and pulls the cotyledons and shoot tip of the growing seedlings into the air. Beans, tamarind, and papaya are examples of plants that germinate this way.

==== Hypogeal ====
Germination can also be done by hypogeal germination (or hypogeous germination), where the epicotyl elongates and forms the hook. In this type of germination, the cotyledons stay underground where they eventually decompose. For example: peas, chickpeas and mango germinate this way.

=== Monocot germination ===
In monocot seeds, the embryo&#x27;s radicle and cotyledon are covered by a coleorhiza and coleoptile, respectively. The coleorhiza is the first part to grow out of the seed, followed by the radicle. The coleoptile is then pushed up through the ground until it reaches the surface. There, it stops elongating and the first leaves emerge.

=== Precocious germination ===
When a seed germinates without undergoing all four stages of seed development, i.e., globular, heart shape, torpedo shape, and cotyledonary stage, it is known as precocious germination.

== Pollen germination ==
Another germination event during the life cycle of gymnosperms and flowering plants is the germination of a pollen grain after pollination. Like seeds, pollen grains are severely dehydrated before being released to facilitate their dispersal from one plant to another. They consist of a protective coat containing several cells (up to 8 in gymnosperms, 2–3 in flowering plants). One of these cells is a tube cell. Once the pollen grain lands on the stigma of a receptive flower (or a female cone in gymnosperms), it takes up water and germinates. Pollen germination is facilitated by hydration on the stigma, as well as by the structure and physiology of the stigma and style. Pollen can also be induced to germinate &quot;in vitro&quot; (in a petri dish or test tube).

During germination, the tube cell elongates into a pollen tube. In the flower, the pollen tube then grows towards the ovule where it discharges the sperm produced in the pollen grain for fertilization. The germinated pollen grain with its two sperm cells is the mature male microgametophyte of these plants.

=== Self-incompatibility ===
Since most plants carry both male and female reproductive organs in their flowers, there is a high risk of self-pollination and thus inbreeding. Some plants use the control of pollen germination as a way to prevent this self-pollination. Germination and growth of the pollen tube involve molecular signaling between stigma and pollen. In self-incompatibility in plants, the stigma of certain plants can molecularly recognize pollen from the same plant and prevent it from germinating.

== Spore germination ==
Germination can also refer to the emergence of cells from resting spores and the growth of sporeling hyphae or thalli from spores in fungi, algae and some plants.

Conidia are asexual reproductive (reproduction without the fusing of gametes) spores of fungi which germinate under specific conditions. A variety of cells can be formed from the germinating conidia. The most common are germ tubes which grow and develop into hyphae. The initial formation and subsequent elongation of the germ tube in the fungus &quot;Aspergillus niger&quot; has been captured in 3D using holotomography microscopy. Another type of cell is a conidial anastomosis tube (CAT); these differ from germ tubes in that they are thinner, shorter, lack branches, exhibit determinate growth and home toward each other. Each cell is of a tubular shape, but the conidial anastomosis tube forms a bridge that allows fusion between conidia.

=== Resting spores ===
In resting spores, germination involves cracking the thick cell wall of the dormant spore. For example, in zygomycetes the thick-walled zygosporangium cracks open and the zygospore inside gives rise to the emerging sporangiophore. In slime molds, germination refers to the emergence of amoeboid cells from the hardened spore. After cracking the spore coat, further development involves cell division, but not necessarily the development of a multicellular organism (for example in the free-living amoebas of slime molds).

=== Ferns and mosses ===
In plants such as bryophytes, ferns, and a few others, spores germinate into independent gametophytes. In the bryophytes (e.g., mosses and liverworts), spores germinate into protonemata, similar to fungal hyphae, from which the gametophyte grows. In ferns, the gametophytes are small, heart-shaped prothalli that can often be found underneath a spore-shedding adult plant.

=== Bacteria ===
Bacterial spores can be exospores or endospores which are dormant structures produced by a number of different bacteria. They have no or very low metabolic activity and are formed in response to adverse environmental conditions. They allow survival and are not a form of reproduction. Under suitable conditions the spore germinates to produce a viable bacterium. Endospores are formed inside the mother cell, whereas exospores are formed at the end of the mother cell as a bud.

== Light-stimulated germination ==
As mentioned earlier, light can be an environmental factor that stimulates the germination process. The seed needs to be able to determine when is the perfect time to germinate and they do that by sensing environmental cues. Once germination starts, the stored nutrients that have accumulated during maturation start to be digested which then supports cell expansion and overall growth. Within light-stimulated germination, phytochrome B (PHYB) is the photoreceptor that is responsible for the beginning stages of germination. When red light is present, PHYB is converted to its active form and moves from the cytoplasm to the nucleus where it upregulates the degradation of PIF1. PIF1, phytochrome-interaction-factor-1, negatively regulates germination by increasing the expression of proteins that repress the synthesis of gibberellin (GA), a major hormone in the germination process. Another factor that promotes germination is HFR1 which accumulates in light in some way and forms inactive heterodimers with PIF1.

Although the exact mechanism is not known, nitric oxide (NO) plays a role in this pathway as well. NO is thought to repress PIF1 gene expression and stabilises HFR1 in some way to support the start of germination. Bethke et al. (2006) exposed dormant &quot;Arabidopsis&quot; seeds to NO gas and within the next 4 days, 90% of the seeds broke dormancy and germinated. The authors also looked at how NO and GA effects the vacuolation process of aleurone cells that allow the movement of nutrients to be digested. A NO mutant resulted in inhibition of vacuolation but when GA was later added the process was active again leading to the belief that NO is prior to GA in the pathway. NO may also lead to the decrease in sensitivity of abscisic acid (ABA), a plant hormone largely responsible for seed dormancy. The balance between GA and ABA is important. When ABA levels are higher than GA then that leads to dormant seeds and when GA levels are higher, seeds germinate. The switch between seed dormancy and germination needs to occur at a time when the seed has the best chances of surviving and an important cue that begins the process of seed germination and overall plant growth is light.

<text>John Francis Welch Jr. (November 19, 1935 – March 1, 2020) was an American business executive, chemical engineer, and writer. He was Chairman and CEO of General Electric (GE) between 1981 and 2001.

When Welch retired from GE, he received a severance payment of $417 million, the largest such payment in business history up to that point.
In 2006, Welch&#x27;s net worth was estimated at $720 million.

==Early life and education==
Jack Welch was born in Peabody, Massachusetts, the only child of Grace (Andrews), a homemaker, and John Francis Welch Sr., a Boston &amp; Maine Railroad conductor. Welch was Irish American and Catholic. His paternal and maternal grandparents were both Irish.

Throughout his early life in middle school and high school, Welch found work in the summers as a golf caddie, newspaper delivery boy, shoe salesman, and drill press operator. Welch attended Salem High School, where he participated in baseball, football, and captained the hockey team and became second lieutenant right after graduating

Late in his senior year, Welch was accepted to University of Massachusetts Amherst, where he studied chemical engineering. Welch worked in chemical engineering at Sunoco and PPG Industries during his college summers. In his sophomore year, he became a member of the Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity. Welch graduated in 1957 with a Bachelor of Science degree in chemical engineering, turning down offers from several companies in order to attend graduate school at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He graduated from the University of Illinois, in 1960, with a master&#x27;s and a PhD in chemical engineering.

Jack later received an honorary Doctor of Science from University of Massachusetts Amherst in 1982 and honorary doctorate from University of California, Los Angeles in 2009.

== General Electric ==
Welch joined General Electric in 1960. He worked as a junior chemical engineer in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, at a salary of $10,500, which would be equivalent to approximately $112,000 in 2025 dollars. In 1961, Welch planned to quit his job as junior engineer because he was dissatisfied with the raise offered to him and was unhappy with the bureaucracy he observed at GE. Welch was persuaded to remain at GE by Reuben Gutoff, an executive at the company, who promised him that he would help create the small-company atmosphere Welch desired. In 1963, an explosion blew the roof off the factory under Welch&#x27;s management, and he was almost fired.

By 1968, Welch became the vice president and head of GE&#x27;s plastics division, which at the time was a $26 million operation for GE. Welch oversaw production as well as the marketing for the GE-developed plastics Lexan and Noryl. Not long after, in 1971, Welch also became the vice president of GE&#x27;s metallurgical and chemical divisions. By 1973, Welch was named group executive, managing chemical, metallurgical, medical systems, appliance components and electronic components businesses. He held that position until 1979, which involved him working with the corporate headquarters, exposing him to many of the &quot;big fish&quot; he would one day be among. In 1977 Welch was named senior vice president and head of Consumer Products and Services Division, a position he held until 1979 when he became the vice chairman of GE.

In 1981, Welch became GE&#x27;s youngest chairman and CEO, succeeding Reginald H. Jones. By 1982, Welch had dismantled much of the earlier management put together by Jones with aggressive simplification and consolidation. One of his primary leadership directives was that GE had to be No. 1 or No. 2 in the industries it participated in.

===CEO===
Through the 1980s, Welch sought to streamline GE. In 1981, he made a speech in New York City called &quot;Growing fast in a slow-growth economy&quot;, which is often acknowledged as the &quot;dawn&quot; of the shareholder-value movement. Under Welch&#x27;s leadership, GE increased market value from $12 billion in 1981 to $410 billion when he retired, making 600 acquisitions while shifting into emerging markets. Welch pioneered a policy of informality at the work place, allowing all employees to have a small-business experience at a large corporation. Welch worked to eradicate perceived inefficiency by trimming inventories and dismantling the bureaucracy that had almost led him to leave GE in the past. He closed factories, reduced payrolls and cut lackluster units.

Welch valued surprise and made unexpected visits to GE&#x27;s plants and offices. Welch popularized so-called &quot;rank and yank&quot; policies used now by other corporate entities. Each year, Welch would fire the bottom 10% of his managers, regardless of absolute performance. He earned a reputation for brutal candor. He rewarded those in the top 20% with bonuses and employee stock options. He also broadened the stock options program at GE, extending availability from top executives to nearly one third of all employees. Welch is also known for abolishing the nine-layer management hierarchy.

During the early 1980s he was dubbed &quot;Neutron Jack&quot; (in reference to the neutron bomb) for eliminating employees while leaving buildings intact. In &quot;Jack: Straight from the Gut&quot;, Welch stated GE had 411,000 employees at the end of 1980, and 299,000 at the end of 1985. Of the 112,000 who left the payroll, 37,000 were in businesses which GE sold off, and 81,000 were reduced in continuing businesses. In return, GE had tremendously increased its market capitalization. Welch reduced basic research, and closed or sold off under-performing businesses.

In 1986, GE acquired the RCA Corporation for $6.28 billion, the largest non-oil company merger in history up to that time. Welch and GE subsequently took up an office in the iconic RCA Building, later renamed the GE Building at 30 Rockefeller Plaza. The RCA acquisition resulted in GE liquidating or selling off virtually all of RCA&#x27;s divisions and assets to other companies and maintaining NBC as part of the GE portfolio of businesses. During the 1990s, Welch shifted GE&#x27;s business from manufacturing to financial services through numerous other acquisitions.

Welch adopted Motorola&#x27;s Six Sigma quality program in late 1995. In 1980, the year before Welch became CEO, GE recorded revenues of roughly $26.8 billion and in 2000, the year before he left, they were nearly $130 billion. By 1999 he was named &quot;Manager of the Century&quot; by &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine.

There was a lengthy and publicized succession planning saga prior to his retirement among James McNerney, Robert Nardelli, and Jeff Immelt, with Immelt eventually selected to succeed Welch as chairman and CEO. His successor plan had always been a priority, as noted in his 1991 speech &quot;From now on, [choosing my successor] is the most important decision I&#x27;ll make. It occupies a considerable amount of thought almost every day.&quot;

Welch&#x27;s &quot;walk-away&quot; package from GE was not valued at the time of his retirement, but GMI Ratings estimates its worth at $420 million.

He served as Chairman of The Business Council in 1991 and 1992.

=== Criticism ===
Upon his retirement from GE in 2001, Welch had stated that his effectiveness as its CEO for two decades would be measured by the company&#x27;s performance for a comparable period under his successors. Welch had grown GE to over $450 billion in market capitalization, of which about 40% was in financial services.

Twenty years later, the company&#x27;s market capitalization was only $200 billion, a decrease of ~55%, and Welch refused to discuss its decline, other than noting much of the decline had resulted from investments in real estate, and that his immediate, handpicked successor Jeff Immelt had to deal with the after effects of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack. &quot;The New York Times&quot; published a critical article in 2017, noting GE&#x27;s stock price as overvalued under Welch because of the growth of the financial services sector, as well as describing the amalgamated corporation&#x27;s decline in 16 years under Immelt, who likewise was one of the country&#x27;s highest-paid managers and eventually sold off two of Welch&#x27;s largest acquisitions, NBCUniversal and GE Capital.

Under Welch&#x27;s leadership, GE waged a twenty-year battle with the Environmental Protection Agency and New York State over polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) that the company dumped into the Hudson River at its capacitor products division plant in Hudson Falls, New York.

Welch disputed scientists who classified PCBs as forever chemicals that can cause negative health consequences. The chemicals contaminated the aquifer beneath the plant to the point that the water was unusable for human consumption without treatment. New York State&#x27;s Department of Environmental Consumption also advised people against eating fish from the river near the site. He went on to call the Obama administration&#x27;s prioritization of addressing climate change &quot;radical behavior&quot;.

According to &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; in 1998, Welch&#x27;s critics questioned whether the short-term performance pressure he placed on employees may have led them to &quot;cut corners&quot;, thus contributing to subsequent scandals over defense-contracting, and/or the Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. bond-trading scheme in the early 1990s.

The following year, CEO Welch took issue with reclassification of GE in the &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 as a &quot;diversified financial services company&quot; rather than an &quot;electrical equipment company&quot;, and by 2005 many had noted that the price-earnings ratios of the financial services sector were lower than that for GE. In 2014, GE Capital (the company&#x27;s major financial services branch organized during Welch&#x27;s tenure) agreed to the largest credit card discrimination settlement in history, concerning many years of deceptive marketing as well as discriminatory credit practices. After Welch&#x27;s tenure, GE Capital had been labeled as &quot;too big to fail&quot; and had become regulated by the Federal Reserve. The retired Welch publicly praised his former firm&#x27;s &quot;slim-down&quot; and return to being an industrial company. In 2018 Welch discussed the different financial culture in Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., whose acquisition he arranged during his tenure at GE, and whose ethos was based on short-term bonus calculations. Shortly before the settlement was announced, GE Capital renamed itself as Synchrony Bank; the spin-off took two years.

Welch also often received criticism for a lack of compassion for the middle class and working class. When asked about excessive CEO pay compared to ordinary workers (including backdating stock options, golden parachutes for nonperformance, and extravagant retirement packages), Welch labeled such allegations &quot;outrageous&quot; and vehemently opposed proposed SEC regulations affecting executive compensation. Countering the public uproar, Welch declared that CEO compensation should continue to be dictated by the &quot;free market&quot;, without interference from government or other outside parties.

Welch&#x27;s income and assets came under particular scrutiny during his divorce from his second wife, Jane Welch, in 2001, for adultery with the woman who became his third wife. Court filings during the divorce described Welch&#x27;s GE compensation, which led to a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation of the then-retired Welch&#x27;s employment contracts with GE.

In 1996, Welch and GE had agreed to a &quot;retention package&quot; worth $2.5 million, and which promised continued access after Welch&#x27;s retirement to benefits he had received as CEO—including an apartment in New York, baseball tickets and the use of a private jet and chauffeured car. Welch stated that he did not want more money, nor a more traditional stock package, but instead preferred to retain the lifestyle he had enjoyed as GE&#x27;s CEO. According to a 2008 interview with Welch, he had filed the agreement with the SEC, and addressed the media attention and accusations of being &quot;greedy&quot; by renouncing those benefits.

In 2012, Welch and his third wife, Suzy Welch, quit their business associations with Fortune magazine and Reuters news service after &quot;Fortune&quot; published an article which criticized Welch&#x27;s tweet, shortly before the 2012 election, which alleged that the Obama administration manipulated certain economic statistics, as well as another article which elucidated the 100,000 jobs GE lost during his tenure as CEO.

==Later career==
Following Welch&#x27;s retirement from General Electric, he became an adviser to private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice and to the chief executive of IAC, Barry Diller. In addition to his consulting and advisory roles, Welch had been active on the public speaking circuit and co-wrote a popular column for &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; with his wife, Suzy, for four years until November 2009. The column was syndicated by &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

In September 2004, the Central Intelligence Agency published a parody of Welch applying his management skills while serving as imagined Deputy Director of Intelligence.

In 2005, he published &quot;Winning&quot;, a book about management co-written with Suzy Welch, which reached No. 1 on &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; bestseller list, and appeared on &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

On January 25, 2006, Welch gave his name to Sacred Heart University&#x27;s College of Business, which was known as the &quot;John F. Welch College of Business&quot; until 2016, when it began using the name the &quot;Jack Welch College of Business&quot;. Since September 2006, Welch had been teaching a class at the MIT Sloan School of Management to a hand-picked group of 30 MBA students with a demonstrated career interest in leadership.

In December 2016, Welch joined a business forum assembled by then president-elect Donald Trump to provide strategic and policy advice on economic issues.

===Jack Welch Management Institute===
In 2009, Welch founded the Jack Welch Management Institute (JWMI), a program at Chancellor University that offered an online executive Master of Business Administration. The institute was acquired by Strayer University in 2011. Welch had been very actively involved with the curriculum, faculty and students since the beginning of the institution. JWMI&#x27;s MBA program was recently named the number one most influential education brand on Linkedin and one of the top business schools to watch in 2016. The program has also been named one of the Top 25 Online MBA Programs four years in a row (2017, 2018, 2019, 2020) by The Princeton Review. Its goal is not to make money, but to build over time focusing on the quality of the program and increasing the number of students enrolled year after year.

At GE, Welch became known for his teaching and growing leaders. He had taught at MIT Sloan School of Management and taught seminars to CEOs all over the globe. &quot;More than 35 CEOs at today&#x27;s top companies [were] trained under Jack Welch&quot;. JWMI students had direct access to Welch and he hosted quarterly video conferences with his students.

It is known that along with his video conferences, Welch created many video responses to messages on bulletin boards and answered individual emails. His investment in the university was also reflected in his interest in the institute&#x27;s Net Promoter score (NPS). He administered surveys on satisfaction regularly and scrutinized the results to find scores that needed improvement. In an interview with &quot;Wired Academic&quot;, Welch explained the overall status of his MBA program, stating that the persistence rate of students continuing on to a second year had grown from 90% to 95%, and that JWMI turns away very few students in the admissions process. He also said that he would like better leadership training for MBA students.

== Personal life ==
Welch had four children with his first wife, Carolyn. They divorced amicably in 1987 after 28 years of marriage. His second wife, Jane Beasley, was a former mergers-and-acquisitions lawyer. She married Welch in April 1989, and they divorced in 2003. While Welch had crafted a prenuptial agreement, Beasley insisted on a ten-year time limit to its applicability, and thus she was able to leave the marriage reportedly with around $180 million.

Welch&#x27;s third wife, Suzy Wetlaufer (née Spring), co-authored his 2005 book &quot;Winning&quot; as Suzy Welch. She served briefly as the editor-in-chief of the &quot;Harvard Business Review.&quot; Welch&#x27;s wife at the time, Jane Beasley, found out about an affair between Wetlaufer and Welch. Beasley informed the &quot;Review&quot; and Wetlaufer was forced to resign in early 2002 after admitting to the affair with Welch while preparing an interview with him for the magazine. They married on April 24, 2004.

Starting in January 2012, Welch and Suzy Welch wrote a biweekly column for Reuters and &quot;Fortune&quot;, which they both left on October 9, 2012, after an article critical of Welch and his GE career was published by &quot;Fortune&quot;.

==Death==
Welch died from kidney failure at his home in New York City on March 1, 2020, at age 84.

== Politics ==
Welch identified politically as a Republican. He stated that global warming is &quot;the attack on capitalism that socialism couldn&#x27;t bring&quot;, and that it is a form of &quot;mass neurosis&quot;. Yet he said that every business must embrace green products and green ways of doing business, &quot;whether you believe in global warming or not ... because the world wants these products&quot;.

Regarding shareholder value, Welch said in a &quot;Financial Times&quot; interview on the global financial crisis of 2008–2009, &quot;On the face of it, shareholder value is the dumbest idea in the world. Shareholder value is a result, not a strategy...your main constituencies are your employees, your customers and your products.&quot;

Welch was widely criticized for his views on the job numbers from September 2012.
After the Bureau of Labor Statistics released employment data stating that the U.S. unemployment rate had dropped from 8.1% to 7.8%, Welch tweeted, &quot;Unbelievable jobs numbers ... these Chicago guys will do anything ... can&#x27;t debate so change numbers&quot;. Welch stood by his tweet, stating if he could write it again, he would add question marks at the end to make it clear that his intention was to raise a question over the legitimacy of the numbers. A subsequent &quot;New York Post&quot; article on the employment data suggested manipulation of some of the survey responses by an individual employee in 2010, but that article was widely debunked, including the fact that the employee had not worked at the Bureau since 2011. No proof of the political manipulation of the job numbers from September 2012 has been presented. The Census Bureau later released a statement denying the possibility of systematic manipulation of the data. Still, in an opinion piece in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, Welch wrote that the debate led to people looking at unemployment data more carefully and skeptically. Referencing his original tweet, he stated &quot;Thank God I did&quot;, in a &quot;Squawk Box&quot; appearance, and also wrote, &quot;The coming election is too important to be decided on a number. Especially when that number seems so wrong&quot;.

==Legacy==

Welch has been described as &quot;perhaps the most celebrated American boss of recent decades&quot;.
Yet by Wall Street measures, a $100,000 investment in GE shares in the year 2000 (near the end of Welch&#x27;s tenure) had lost about 80 percent of its value as of the year 2021.

Despite this trend, in a 2015 article in &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot;, business consultant Ron Ashkenas argues that &quot;Jack Welch&#x27;s approach to breaking down silos still works&quot;, citing examples of engineering companies who have discovered for themselves that &quot;fragmented, geographically dispersed&quot; patterns of organization make it &quot;very difficult ... to coordinate efforts across functions, keep everyone focused on the cost and delivery goals and get people to reach consensus&quot;.

Welch has been criticized for practices that have harmed workers and the company: he eliminated thousands of jobs at GE, contributing to a reduction of the U.S. manufacturing base. He eliminated 10% of employees every year, a practice adopted by many other companies. He was a leading proponent of mergers and acquisitions, helping to give rise to an economy that is more concentrated and less dynamic. He pioneered &quot;financialization&quot;, changing GE from a manufacturing company into, effectively, an unregulated bank, which harmed GE over the long term.

As of late 2021, General Electric planned to break into three public companies and effectively cease to exist. The companies would separately operate in the aviation, health care and energy markets. As of 2021, GE was headed by H. Lawrence Culp Jr. who was named in 2018 as its fourth CEO since Welch&#x27;s departure.

===Wider impact===
Welch&#x27;s practices and legacy were criticized as ultimately self-destructive and a bad influence on corporate America by author David Gelles in his 2022 book &quot;The Man Who Broke Capitalism: How Jack Welch Gutted the Heartland and Crushed the Soul of Corporate America―and How to Undo His Legacy&quot;.

== Popular culture ==
On March 11, 2010, Welch cameoed as himself in the NBC sitcom &quot;30 Rock&quot;, appearing in the season four episode &quot;Future Husband&quot;. In the episode, Welch confronts Alec Baldwin&#x27;s character, Jack Donaghy, to confirm the sale of NBC Universal to a fictional Philadelphia-based cable company called Kabletown. The sale is a satirical reference to the real-world acquisition of NBCUniversal from General Electric by Comcast in November 2009.
