<text>Charles Vincent Massey (February 20, 1887December 30, 1967) was a Canadian diplomat and statesman who served as the 18th governor general of Canada from 1952 to 1959. Massey was the first governor general of Canada who was born in Canada. 

Massey was born into an influential Toronto family and was educated in Ontario and England, obtaining a degree in history and befriending future prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King while studying at the University of Oxford. He was commissioned into the military in 1917 for the remainder of the First World War and, after a brief stint in the Canadian Cabinet, began his diplomatic career, serving in envoys to the United States and United Kingdom. Upon his return to Canada in 1946, Massey headed a royal commission on the arts between 1949 and 1951, which resulted in the Massey Report and subsequently the establishment of the National Library of Canada and the Canada Council of the Arts, among other grant-giving agencies. In 1952 he was appointed Governor General by King George VI on the recommendation of Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent, to replace the Viscount Alexander of Tunis as viceroy, and he occupied the post until succeeded by Georges Vanier in 1959.

On September 16, 1925, Massey was sworn into the King&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada, giving him the accordant style of &quot;The Honourable&quot;. However, Massey was later, as a former Governor General of Canada, entitled to be styled for life with the superior form of &quot;The Right Honourable&quot;. He subsequently continued his philanthropic work and founded Massey College at the University of Toronto and the Massey Lectures before he died on December 30, 1967.

==Early life, education, and career==
Massey was born in Toronto, Ontario, to Anna (née Vincent) and Chester Daniel Massey, the owner of the Massey-Harris Co. (predecessor to Massey Ferguson) and the patriarch of one of the city&#x27;s wealthiest families. His brother was Canadian-American actor Raymond Massey. The Massey family, of English origin, had immigrated from Cheshire, England, to the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1630. The clan was strongly Methodist and played an important role in supporting local religious, cultural, and educational organizations, including Victoria University, Massey Hall, and the Metropolitan Methodist Church (now the &quot;Metropolitan United Church&quot;). Massey was thus raised among Toronto&#x27;s elite, which gave him a number of social and familial connections throughout his life. However, despite their status as one of Toronto&#x27;s richest families, the Methodist Masseys were not considered to be one of the FOOFs (Fine Old Ontario Families), the slightly disparaging term used to describe the clique of wealthy Anglican families of English and Loyalist descent who dominated the social life of Toronto from the late 18th century well into the 20th century. To compensate for their parvenus status, Massey together with other members of his family were much given to philanthropy.
Massey was raised in the family mansion at 519 Jarvis Street and educated at St. Andrew&#x27;s College from 1902 to 1906, then at University College at the University of Toronto, despite his family&#x27;s close ties to Victoria College. At the University of Toronto, he enlisted in The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada in 1907 and joined the Kappa Alpha Society, through which he met future prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, who would be his long-time friend. After passing matriculation three years later with his Bachelor of Arts degree in history and English, Massey continued his education at Balliol College at the University of Oxford, where he graduated Master of Arts in history.

In 1911, thinking that the University of Toronto lacked a facility where its 4,000 students could engage in extracurricular activities, Massey donated $16,290 to the students&#x27; fund to build a student centre and thereafter led the endowment and construction efforts. In 1913, he returned to Toronto and became the first Dean of Men at Burwash Hall, the residence recently donated to Victoria University by his father. He also served as a lecturer on modern history at the college. When Canada entered the First World War in 1914, Massey was commissioned as an officer for Military District No. 2 and was called to work for the Cabinet war committee. On June 4, 1915, Massey married Alice Parkin, the daughter of Sir George Robert Parkin, who was a former principal of Upper Canada College (UCC) and secretary of the Rhodes Trust; through the marriage, Massey later became the uncle of George Grant and the great-uncle of Michael Ignatieff. Within a few years, Vincent and Alice had two sons, Lionel Massey (1916–1965) and Hart Parkin Vincent Massey II (1918–1996; a WWII Spitfire pilot who flew with John Gillespie Magee, author of &quot;High Flight&quot;). Massey was discharged at the cessation of hostilities in 1918.

In 1921, Massey became president of his father&#x27;s business, Massey-Harris Co. He also pursued philanthropic interests, mostly in arts and education, such as his collection of paintings and sculpture through his Massey Foundation, which he established in 1918. By the next year, University of Toronto&#x27;s social and athletic facility was completed and dedicated to the memory of Massey&#x27;s grandfather, Hart Massey, as Hart House; there, Massey participated as an amateur actor and director in the building&#x27;s theatre.

==Political career==
In 1925, finding himself unsuited to corporate life, he resigned from Massey-Harris. Later that year, on September 16, he was appointed to the King&#x27;s Privy Council by Governor General the Viscount Byng of Vimy, and was also made a minister without portfolio in Mackenzie King&#x27;s Cabinet. He ran for the House of Commons in the riding of Durham in the 1925 federal election, but was defeated Though he thereafter resigned his cabinet post, Massey was still included in the Canadian delegation to the 1926 Imperial Conference, where was drafted the Balfour Declaration that would ultimately lead to vast constitutional changes in the role of the monarch and his viceroys throughout the empire.

In 1932, Massey became the first president of the newly formed National Liberal Federation of Canada, before which the Liberal Party was a loose and informal association of national, provincial, and regional entities without a permanent central organization. In the 1935 federal election, the Liberals returned to office with a majority and Mackenzie King was once again prime minister. Massey managed the Liberal campaign in the 1935 election. In his last year in office, Bennett had swung sharply to the left, passing a set of bills known as &quot;Bennett&#x27;s New Deal&quot; that were modelled after the New Deal in the United States that sought to increase state involvement in the Canadian economy. In the 1935 election, to make up for Mackenzie King&#x27;s lack of charisma who was additionally a poor speaker and whose views on the issues were inscrutable, Massey sought to portray Mackenzie King as a steady, competent, experienced leader who could best manage the Great Depression. Massey coined the election slogan &quot;It&#x27;s either King or Chaos!&quot;, portraying Bennett as an erratic leader whose judgement could not be trusted, unlike Mackenzie King.

Massey would have preferred to return to politics, not the least because he thought he would make a better prime minister than Mackenzie King, whose muddled politics Massey privately held in contempt, but he accepted a diplomatic career as a consolation prize. Massey believed that Canada was a British nation located in North America that also had a French infusion and that the essence of being a Canadian was to adopt primarily British traditions to a North American settling. Reflecting his Anglophilia, Massey quite consciously sought to model his mannerisms after those of an upper-class &quot;English gentleman&quot;, which limited his political appeal as it led to accusations of snobbery. Massey&#x27;s style of convoying a &quot;tranquil consciousness of effortless superiority&quot; that he picked up during his time at Oxford annoyed many Canadians, most notably his patron Mackenzie King, who decided that being a high commissioner to Britain would be the best place for him.

Massey advocated excluding Jews from immigrating to Canada while Jewish refugees were fleeing Europe. He believed Jews were likely Communists and would steal jobs from native-born Canadians.

==Diplomatic career==

Later in 1926, on November 25, Governor General the Marquess of Willingdon acted on Mackenzie King&#x27;s advice to appoint Massey as the first Canadian Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the United States for His Majesty&#x27;s Government in Canada, making Massey Canada&#x27;s first ever envoy with full diplomatic credentials to a foreign capital. Massey returned to Canada in 1930, as Mackenzie King had put his name forward for appointment as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. However, five days after Massey relinquished his post in Washington, DC, Mackenzie King&#x27;s Liberal Party was defeated in the federal election, and Richard Bennett became prime minister. Bennett objected to Massey as the government&#x27;s representative to the UK on the grounds that, as a former Liberal Cabinet member, Massey did not enjoy the political confidence of the new Conservative government that was needed by the individual occupying the position.

==High Commissioner in London==
On November 8, 1935, Massey was appointed the High Commissioner to the United Kingdom for His Majesty&#x27;s Government in Canada and arrived at Canada House to find as his secretary the man who would be his successor as Governor General of Canada, Georges Vanier. The two men set about regular diplomatic business, but, throughout 1936, Massey had to contend with the death of King George V and the accession and then the abdication of King Edward VIII in favour of his younger brother, Prince Albert, Duke of York, who ascended the throne as George VI. Massey was a passionate Anglophile for whom Britain was his ideal, and he had long wanted to be the Canadian high commissioner in London. Through the Massey family were American in origin, having arrived in Upper Canada in 1802, he invariably failed to mention that in his speeches, instead giving the very misleading impression that the Massey family–who had originated in Cheshire and immigrated to New England in the 17th century-
had instead gone directly from England to Canada.

During the abdication crisis of 1936, Massey supported the prime minister Stanley Baldwin against King Edward VIII, sharing the prime minister&#x27;s viewpoint that it was not acceptable for the king and the supreme governor of the Church of England to marry a twice-divorced American woman, Wallis Simpson. Massey told Baldwin that he had his full support in his demand that the king either give up his throne or Simpson, though he also advised Baldwin that the king was popular in Canada, and many Canadians would not understand why the king could not marry Simpson, saying the matter had to be handled very carefully least it alienate the Canadian people from the monarchy. The abdication crisis cemented Massey&#x27;s dislike of the man who rapidly become his least favorite British politician, Winston Churchill, who supported the king&#x27;s right to keep his throne and marry Mrs. Simpson. Massey in his reports to Mackenzie King (who acted as his own External Affairs minister) described Churchill as a reckless adventurer who was &quot;exploiting the crisis for his own political ends&quot;. Massey believed that Churchill was using the crisis together with the &quot;press barons&quot; Lord Beaverbrook and Lord Rothermere to start a popular movement aimed at deposing Baldwin as Conservative Party leader in order to make himself prime minister. When Churchill gave a speech in the favour of the king in the House of Commons, Massey approvingly reported he was shouted down as Churchill had &quot;shown his irresponsible, free-booting disposition&quot;. In May 1937, Massey was greatly honoured to have taken part in the coronation of King George VI, where he served as one of the royal standard-bearers. Massey held an intense reverence for the monarchy that bordered on the religious as he wrote: &quot;What follows defies all adjectives. No ceremonial could be finer or more moving-this country has a genius for such things because of the combination of essentially English qualities of which English pageantry is an expression, a romantic sense, a feeling for precision without rigidity, a sense of symbolism kept in close check by a sense of humor, a practical sense which relates the ceremonial to present-day reality. Pageantry in the English tradition has always stood for pageantry with intelligence and feeling&quot;. The only element that marred the coronation for him was Mackenzie King&#x27;s order that Massey not wear knee breeches as anachronistic, an order he unhappily complied with. Massey privately complained: &quot;I wish to goodness that some of my countrymen wouldn&#x27;t have an almost religious antipathy to knee breeches&quot;. Massey was dressed in his best clothes for the coronation and was described as looking &quot;like a medieval strained glass window&quot;.

Starting in May 1936, weekly meetings started to be held at Massey&#x27;s house attended by all of the Dominion high commissioners in London to discuss matters of common concern. Massey together with Stanley Bruce of Australia and Charles te Water of South Africa were considered to be the &quot;big three&quot; of the Dominion high commissioners as Australia, South Africa, and Canada were viewed as the three most powerful Dominions. However, both Bruce and te Water were held in far higher esteem by the British than Massey, who was felt to be an embarrassment, as he tried too hard to be accepted by the Establishment. Massey cultivated an aristocratic, sophisticated demeanor which gave him a reputation in London as a snob. By contrast, te Water was respected for his intelligence, although disliked for being arrogant and aloof, while Bruce, as appropriate for a former Australian prime minister, was felt to be the most approachable of the high commissioners and had a populist &quot;down-to-earth&quot; demeanour. Bruce was held in a special esteem in London, and his influence was increased by his friendship with Geoffrey Dawson, the editor of &quot;The Times&quot;. Likewise, both Bruce and te Water had more influence on their respective governments, as both men were friends of their respective prime ministers, namely Joseph Lyons of Australia and J. B. M. Hertzog of South Africa, while Mackenzie King seems to have appointed the Anglophile Massey as high commissioner as a sop to his ego. The mildly Anglophobic Mackenzie King complained that Massey&#x27;s dispatches to him were &quot;too English&quot; for his liking. Te Water was considered to be the most intelligent and able of all the Dominion high commissioners, and he often acted as their informal leader. The British historian Max Beloff later described the Dominion high commissioners as a close-knit group who worked for appeasement of Germany.

All of the Dominion high commissioners held certain common beliefs that made them into supporters of appeasement. As a group, they believed that the Treaty of Versailles had been too harsh towards Germany, and that it was France rather than Germany that was the principle trouble-maker in Europe. In common with the other high commissioners, Massey believed that the efforts of the &quot;Reich&quot; to challenge the international order created by the Treaty of Versailles were just and moral, and it was France&#x27;s efforts to upheld the Versailles system which made the French rather the Germans the main danger to world peace. Alongside this view of European politics went an intense dread of the Soviet Union, which was the nation that Massey and the other high commissioners feared the most. Massey was opposed to the alliances that France signed with Czechoslovakia in 1925 and with the Soviet Union in 1935, seeing this as irresponsible diplomacy on the part of the French, who were attempting to preserve the Versailles system instead of giving in to German demands, as he felt that they should. One of the most important influences on Massey was Lord Lothian, a Scottish aristocrat and a liberal intellectual whose perspective was always more in terms of the British empire than in terms of Britain, a viewpoint that endeared him to Massey. Lord Lothian had become convinced by 1923 that the Treaty of Versailles was a monstrously harsh peace treaty whose terms needed to be revised, and for much of the 1920s and 1930s had been a leading enthusiast for Germany. Lothian visited Germany twice, in 1935 and again in 1937, to meet Adolf Hitler, and in both cases came away impressed. Much of Massey&#x27;s favourable views about Nazi Germany were due to his talks with Lothian, who assured him that if only the Treaty of Versailles were revised, the peace of the world would be saved. Charles Corbin, the French ambassador to the court of St. James, who met all of the Dominion high commissioners together with all of the Dominion leaders during the Imperial conference of 1937, described them all as a group who were collectively ignorant of Europe, reporting to Paris on 3 June 1937 that he was astonished at how little they knew about Eastern Europe, a region they viewed via very simplistic clichés.

As high commissioner, Massey used his connections to bring to Canada House a host of personalities from &quot;the highest quarters&quot;. Two such persons were Viscount and Viscountess Astor, who were the nucleus of the Cliveden set, which itself was a group of aristocratic individuals rumoured to be Germanophiles, not only in favour of the appeasement of Hitler, but also supporters of friendly relations with Nazi Germany. Though these allegations were historically challenged as exaggerations, Irving Abella and Harold Troper claimed in their book &quot;None Is Too Many: Canada and the Jews of Europe 1933–1948&quot; that Massey was an enthusiastic supporter of the Munich Agreement and worked in concert with various elected and non-elected people in government, including Mackenzie King and Ernest Lapointe, to put obstacles in the way of Jewish refugees fleeing Europe for Canada, or even using Canada as a stopover en route to some other country. However, Canadian immigration policy at the time favoured trained farmers, which excluded most Jews, who were largely city dwellers, and the Cabinet of Mackenzie King was already resistant to changes in the law. Seven decades later, these accusations against Massey resulted in a campaign in Windsor, Ontario, to rename a high school that had originally been named in his honour.

On 24 April 1938, the Sudetenland crisis began when the Sudeten German leader Konrad Henlein in a speech in Karlsbad (modern Karlovy Vary) put forward the so-called Karlsbad programme, whose eight points would have given the Sudetenland much autonomy within Czechoslovakia. The Karlsbad programme had been written in Berlin, and the German government promptly endorsed the Karlsbad programme, saying it would go to war if Czechoslovakia rejected the Karlsbad programme. In the May crisis of 1938, Massey blamed President Edvard Beneš of Czechoslovakia rather than Hitler, writing in a cable to Mackenzie King that it was Czechoslovakia that was the aggressor and Germany the victim. On 28 May 1938, the British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax in a meeting with all the Dominion high commissioners told them that the British government was convinced that Czechoslovakia with its mixture of Czechs, Slovaks, Germans, Magyars, Poles and Ukrainians could not last as a unitary state, and the best solution would be to turn Czechoslovakia into a federation. Halifax felt the Karlsbad programme, through problematic in certain respects, offered the starting point to turn Czechoslovakia into a federation. After the meeting, Halifax took Massey aside for a talk, saying he was very interested in learning how English Canadians and French Canadians got along well in the Canadian federation, saying he envisioned a &quot;Canadian solution&quot; to the problems of Czechoslovakia. Halifax told Massey he wanted to see Czechoslovakia turned into a Canadian-style federation so that the Czechs and the Sudeten Germans would act more like English Canadians and French Canadians and less like themselves. The fact that Beneš rejected the British advice to engage in constitutional changes to make Czechoslovakia into a federation until early September 1938 cost him much sympathy in London, and added to the perception that it was Beneš who was the danger to peace.

During the Sudetenland crisis of 1938, Massey very much wanted President Franklin D. Roosevelt of the United States to step in as a mediator, and was disappointed when Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain told him that he did not think much of this plan, saying he much doubted that Roosevelt was willing to play the role of the mediator. Massey saw the Sudetenland crisis as a matter of &quot;saving civilization&quot; as he believed that another world war would be the end of Western civilization. On 12 September 1938, the crisis dramatically escalated when Hitler in his speech at the Nuremberg Party Rally announced that the acceptance of the Karlsbad programme was not enough and instead demanded the Sudetenland &quot;go home to the &quot;Reich&quot;&quot;, saying he now wanted the Sudetenland incorporated into Germany, a demand that President Beneš promptly rejected. The fact that Hitler engaged in much personal abuse of Beneš in his speech was not helpful to peace as Massey reported to Mackenzie King, but he still clung to his belief that it was Beneš who was the problem, not Hitler. Massey believed that Hitler&#x27;s demands for the Sudetenland were moral and just, that Czechoslovakia was not worth fighting for, and it was France that by refusing to renounce its alliance with Czechoslovakia was the principle trouble-maker. Massey believed that Britain should only go to war if Hitler was seeking world domination, and as he did not believe that this was the case with the Sudetenland, he was opposed to war with Germany in 1938. On 14 September 1938, Massey met with te Water where both men agreed that &quot;this astonishing episode&quot; as they deemed it with Britain on the brink of the war must not be allowed to come to war, and that Britain should pressure Czechoslovakia to cede the Sudetenland. On 19 September 1938, the Dominion secretary Malcolm MacDonald met with all of the Dominion high commissioners to tell them that Chamberlain had agreed to Hitler&#x27;s demand that the Sudetenland &quot;go home to the &quot;Reich&quot;&quot; and that Britain would offer a &quot;guarantee&quot; of the rest of Czechoslovakia as the reward for ceding the Sudetenland. Bruce supported the idea of the &quot;guarantee&quot; and even offered to have Australia join in with &quot;guaranteeing&quot; Czechoslovakia; te Water was categorically opposed, saying there was no possibility of South Africa joining in; and Massey in his report to Mackenzie King offered no comment about his feelings other than to say the other high commissioners had insisted upon it. Massey added that he still felt that Beneš was the main danger to the peace, saying his main fear was that Beneš might reject the British peace plan. Much to Massey&#x27;s relief, Beneš accepted the British plan.

On 24 September 1938, all of the Dominion high commissioners met with MacDonald. As was usually the case, te Water acted as their spokesman and he sharply criticised Chamberlain for rejecting Hitler&#x27;s Bad Godesberg ultimatum, saying that Chamberlain should try to modify Hitler&#x27;s terms, but if matters came to &quot;in extremis&quot;, it was better to yield to Hitler&#x27;s terms than go to war. Shortly afterwards, a split emerged with the Dominion high commissioners with Bruce arguing that Chamberlain was correct after all to reject the Bad Godesberg ultimatum, saying it was a matter of British &quot;honour&quot; that the United Kingdom not be allowed to be seen to be bullied, and that a referendum should be held in the Sudetenland to determine what districts wanted to &quot;go home to the &quot;Reich&quot;&quot; and what districts wanted to remain part of Czechoslovakia. By contrast, Massey, te Water and the Irish high commissioner John Dulanty all supported accepting Hitler&#x27;s demand that the &quot;Reich&quot; be allowed to occupy the Sudetenland prior to 1 October 1938. On 28 September 1938, both Bruce and Massey supported te Water&#x27;s statement that it was &quot;psychologically wrong&quot; to blame Hitler for the crisis and with te Water&#x27;s demand that Chamberlain find a way to silence the &quot;bellicose&quot; MPs like Winston Churchill who were criticizing his government&#x27;s policies in the House of Commons. At another meeting with MacDonald on 29 September, both te Water and Massey protested against the British appeal to Beneš to &quot;not tie&quot; Chamberlain&#x27;s hands, complaining that it implied that Beneš had the power to do so. When Chamberlain left Heston airport to attend the Munich conference on 29 September 1938, both te Water and Massey were there to offer him their best wishes to save the peace at Munich.

In March 1939, Europe was plunged into a new crisis, this time concerning the city-state of the Free City of Danzig (modern Gdańsk, Poland) as Hitler now announced that he wanted the Free City to &quot;go home to the &quot;Reich&quot;&quot;, a demand that was felt certain to cause a war with Poland, which had certain rights in Danzig and always taken the position that any attempt to return to Danzig to Germany would be a &quot;casus belli&quot;. Massey was greatly influenced by te Water, and usually followed whatever line te Water was taking with regard to the British. Following the German occupation of the Czech half of Czecho-Slovakia on 15 March 1939, the policy of the Chamberlain government notably altered. In a speech in Birmingham on 17 March 1939, Chamberlain announced that if Hitler was seeking world domination, Britain would go to war. At a meeting with the Dominions Secretary Sir Thomas Inskip, te Water, supported by Massey, assailed the change of policy, saying that Germany still deserved &quot;one more chance of saving face&quot;. On 31 March 1939, Chamberlain in a speech in the House of Commons announced the famous British &quot;guarantee&quot; of Poland, stating that Britain would go to war to defend Polish independence, through Chamberlain notably left out Polish territory from the &quot;guarantee&quot;, thereby implying that Britain was still open to having the Polish corridor and Upper Silesia returned to Germany. Later that same day in a meeting at 10 Downing Street, te Water and Massey both told Chamberlain that Germany &quot;had a genuine claim to Danzig&quot;, which made it an &quot;extremely bad reason&quot; to risk a war over.

For Massey, his main concern in the spring of 1939 was not the Danzig visit, but rather organizing the royal visit of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth to Canada, which took place in June–July 1939. Massey had been planning the visit ever since the coronation, and spent much time corresponding with the Governor-General, Lord Tweedsmuir about the preparations for the visit, as the impeding royal visit had less interest for Mackenzie King. Much to Massey&#x27;s delight, he found himself regularly having dinner with the royal family at Windsor Castle to discuss details for the visit. The royal visit was a great success with the king being cheered whatever he went as he visited all nine provinces, leading Massey to write: &quot;The Royal visit to Canada was an event so happy in its conception, so gloriously successful in its achievement, and so fragrant in its memory, that any comment seems both inadequate and superfluous&quot;.

Over the course of the summer of 1939, Massey came to break away from te Water&#x27;s influence, helped by the fact that te Water had taken a holiday in Ireland for much of the summer. Through Massey was not enthusiastic about the possibility of Britain going to war, he came to increasingly accept that it might be inevitable unless Hitler could be persuaded to back down in the Danzig crisis. An additional pressure for a change in views came from Lord Lothian, who had a &quot;volte-face&quot; in his thinking about Nazi Germany, and was by the spring of 1939 was now convinced that Hitler was seeking world domination. Over the course of the summer of 1939, Lothian sought to convince Massey that Hitler&#x27;s aims went beyond revising the Treaty of Versailles towards the domination of the entire world, an effort that Lothian was successful in.

==Second World War==
Nevertheless, Massey was a Canadian and British patriot and worked not only to maximize Canada&#x27;s war effort once the Second World War broke out, but also served through 1936 as the Canadian delegate to the League of Nations, between 1941 and 1945 as a trustee of the National and Tate galleries, and as chair of the Tate&#x27;s board of governors from 1943 to 1945. For this work Massey was inducted by George VI into the Order of the Companions of Honour in 1946. After Britain declared war on 3 September 1939, the high commissioners set themselves up as a &quot;junior war cabinet&quot; that represented their interests with the British government. As Charles te Water was fired on 7 September 1939 for opposing South Africa&#x27;s entry into the war, Bruce and Massey were regarded as the co-leaders of the high commissioners. In a reversal of the expected roles, the New Zealand high commissioner Bill Jordan, a working class British man and a former London policeman who had immigrated to New Zealand in 1904 was the high commissioner best liked by the British, followed up by Bruce. Massey with his aristocratic airs was considered to be a pompous snob who was too overtly proud of the fact that the Masseys were one of Canada&#x27;s richest families.

In September 1939, Massey and Bruce met with the Dominions Secretary, Anthony Eden, to suggest a plan to train airmen in Canada and Australia, which became the genesis of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. Massey always regarded his work as in helping to create the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan as one of his great achievements. However, Massey was undercut by Mackenzie King who in an extraordinary move told the British not to regard Massey as speaking for Canada, leaving the British confused about what was the precise purpose of Massey&#x27;s role in London. Mackenzie King had only very reluctantly declared war on Germany on 10 September 1939 and was keen to minimize Canada&#x27;s role in the war, wanting Canada to do as little as possible, as he feared a repeat of the conscription crisis of 1917. Once the war began, the deeply Anglophile Massey wanted Canada to do as much as possible to help the &quot;mother country&quot;, leading Mackenzie King to marginalize him as Massey&#x27;s views about Canada&#x27;s role in the war were not his views. Massey welcomed the appointment of Churchill as prime minister on 10 May 1940 by King George VI, though he never lost his doubts about the fitness of Churchill to be prime minister, regarding him as an adventurer with a questionable sense of judgement. In late May 1940, Massey informed the British that Canada was sending all of the Royal Canadian Navy&#x27;s destroyers to Britain to assist with the defense of Britain if France surrendered.

In 1940, Massey together with Bruce were extremely unhappy when Churchill appointed Inskip as the dominions secretary to replace Eden, telling the new South African high commissioner Sidney Frank Waterson that Inskip was one of the most incompetent ministers in the Chamberlain cabinet who had once fallen asleep during a crucial cabinet meeting in April 1939. Both Massey and Bruce regarded the appointment of Inskip as dominions secretary as a personal insult, saying that this showed how little Churchill valued the dominions. The fact that Inskip was not allowed to attend the meetings of the War Cabinet, and thus would not be able to inform the high commissioners of the decisions of the war cabinet added to Massey&#x27;s rancor, which he expressed in a letter to Churchill on 3 July 1940. It was only with appointment of Lord Cranborne as Dominions Secretary in 1943 that Massey finally felt there was a competent Dominions Secretary who understood the concerns of the dominions. In July 1940, Massey supported a declaration of proposed British war aims written by Bruce which stated that &quot;we make it abundantly clear that we stand not only for liberty, but for economic and social justice&quot; because that would &quot;give us every chance of mobilising a revolutionary movement in Europe behind the ideals of the British empire&quot;.

Massey was opposed to Britain taking a hardline with Vichy France, as he believed that Marshal Philippe Pétain had only signed the armistice with Germany on 21 June 1940 to save his nation and that Pétain could be persuaded to reenter the war on the Allied side, provided the British were tactful with him. By contrast, Massey had nothing but contempt for the French National Committee in London headed by Charles de Gaulle, a man whom Massey detested and distrusted. Massey&#x27;s views towards Vichy France were to a certain extent governed by domestic considerations as Pétain&#x27;s &quot;révolution nationale&quot; was popular with Catholic conservatives in Quebec, and Massey feared that British actions such as attacking the French fleet at Mers-el-Kébir would increase anti-war feelings in Quebec. During the London blitz, Massey lived in the Dorchester hotel, where he felt he would be safer from German bombs. Massey was strongly opposed to the Destroyers-for-bases deal, under which Britain gave the United States 99-year leases on various British air and naval bases in the British West Indies, British Guiana (modern Guyana), Bermuda and Newfoundland in exchange for 50 elderly American destroyers, some of which were barely seaworthy. Massey was especially opposed to the United States taking over naval and air bases in Newfoundland, which he viewed as a future Canadian province. Massey felt that the American bases in Newfoundland were the first step towards the United States annexing Newfoundland, and in March 1941 delivered a formal note of protest, saying that Churchill signed the Destroyers-for-bases deal without consulting Canada.

From 1942 onward, Massey was involved in a semi-military extension of his duties, representing the interests of the Canadian military headquarters in London, in which capacity, he worked very closely with J. L. Ralston, the minister of national defense; General Andrew McNaughton, the commander of the 1st Canadian Army; and his deputy General Harry Crerar. Massey was closer to Crerar than to McNaughton, with whom he had difficult relations, and increasingly came to share Crerar&#x27;s conviction that McNaughton in a classic case of the Peter principle had been promoted to his level of incompetence. McNaughton had earned a sterling reputation in the First World War as one of the outstanding &quot;gunners&quot; (artillerymen) in the entire world, and still famous in Second World War as the great Canadian soldier-scientist, a man who had mastered two very different fields. The fact that McNaughton was highly charismatic and very popular with the Canadian people also added to his appeal. However, Crerar felt and Massey came to feel likewise that whatever McNaughton&#x27;s gifts as a &quot;gunner&quot; that was not capable of commanding an army in the field. Massey seems to have missed that Crerar was an intriguer who was always plotting to secure himself a promotion, and that at least part of his animosity against McNaughton was his desire to command the 1st Canadian Army. Lester Pearson during a visit to London reported that McNaughton preferred to deal with him rather than with Massey, reporting to Mackenzie King: &quot;Their temperaments [Massey and McNaughton] were at opposite poles and neither felt at that early stage very comfortable and relaxed with one another&quot;.

In the spring of 1943, Mackenzie King, who until then, had been almost always opposed to the Canadian Army actually fighting in the war, suddenly did a &quot;volte-face&quot; on the issue as he became consumed with the fear that the war might end with Canada winning no victories, which he believed would be the ruin of his political career. Mackenzie King now insisted that the 1st Canadian Infantry Division take part in Operation Husky, the invasion of Sicily planned for July 1943, despite the fact that the British did not want the 1st Division in Sicily. McNaughton was strongly opposed to losing a division from the 1st Canadian Army, which brought tensions with Massey to the fore as the latter on the behalf of Mackenzie King insisted that the 1st Division take part in Operation Husky. As McNaughton was very popular with both the troops under his command and with the Canadian people, Mackenzie King did not want McNaughton to resign in protest. After much haggling, it was agreed that the 1st Division would be detached from the 1st Canadian Army to serve as part of the British 8th Army in Sicily and would return to Britain to rejoin the 1st Army once the Sicilian campaign was over.

Upon his return to Canada Massey continued in the same cultural fields. He sat as chair of the National Gallery of Canada from 1948 to 1952 and served as Chancellor of the University of Toronto from 1948 to 1953. In 1949, Massey was appointed head of the Royal Commission on National Development in the Arts, Letters and Sciences, which investigated the overall state of culture in Canada. Its 1951 Report advocated federal funding of a wide range of cultural activities, and led to the establishment of the National Library of Canada and the Canada Council of the Arts.

==Governor General of Canada==
Massey was the first Canadian-born individual to be appointed Governor General; all his predecessors had been born elsewhere in the British Empire or British Commonwealth. As a widower (his wife had died in 1950), he was also the only unmarried person ever to reside at Rideau Hall until the appointment of Julie Payette in 2017. Usually, the governor general&#x27;s wife is the viceregal consort and acts as the hostess and chatelaine of the household; during Massey&#x27;s tenure, his daughter-in-law, Lilias Massey, fulfilled the role, though she was not accorded the style of &quot;Her Excellency&quot;, usually given to the viceregal consort.

===As governor general-designate===
On February 1, 1952, the Office of the Prime Minister of Canada announced that George VI had approved Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent&#x27;s choice of Massey to succeed the Viscount Alexander of Tunis as the King&#x27;s representative. Five days later, however, the King was dead and Massey, upon his swearing-in, became the first Canadian-born representative of George&#x27;s daughter, Queen Elizabeth II. In the bustle over the king&#x27;s death, there was little fanfare around Massey&#x27;s appointment; Lord Alexander quietly departed Canada shortly after the announcement of Massey as his successor, leaving Chief Justice Thibaudeau Rinfret as administrator of the government in his place, as Massey was, at the time, in London. As he was a member of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom, he attended the new queen&#x27;s Accession Council on February 7.

In Canada, there was some commentary on the new representative of the monarch. The notion of a Canadian-born Governor General, and one not belonging to the peerage, was viewed with suspicion by traditionalists. Massey, thus, was to be a compromise: while it was known he was closely associated with the Liberal Party, having been the group&#x27;s chairman during the 1930s, the governor general-designate was a Canadian by birth but he also embodied loyalty, dignity, and formality, as expected from a viceroy. Massey stated that, for his role as governor general, he looked for inspiration to one of his predecessors and a man Massey had known for decades: the Baron Tweedsmuir, whom Massey said he &quot;greatly admired&quot; and had &quot;learnt much from&quot; during his tenure as governor general.

&quot;Life&quot; magazine ran a profile piece on Massey in which the Marquess of Salisbury described Massey as an elegant individual—citing Massey&#x27;s Oxford schooling and tailored clothing as illustrations—and thoroughly Canadian, though noting that &quot;Vincent&#x27;s a fine chap, but he does make one feel like a bit of a savage.&quot; But the elite demeanour he was sometimes criticized for was not evident in Massey&#x27;s belief that the Crown belonged to Canadians and that it was his task as viceroy to act as a link between the people and the monarch. He similarly believed that the arts were a way to assert Canadian sovereignty and that the various artistic fields should be accessible to all Canadians.

===In office===
On February 28, 1952, Massey was sworn in as governor general of Canada in a ceremony in the Senate chamber, where he was presented with the Canadian Forces&#x27; Decoration (subsequently given to all governors general upon taking office). However, Massey&#x27;s first months as the viceroy were muted, due to the ongoing 16-week period of official mourning. It was not until the coronation of Elizabeth II on June 2, 1953, that Massey was called upon to take charge of any national celebration. For the occasion, he revived the use of the state carriage when he rode in it, with an accompanying guard of Royal Canadian Mounted Police, from the royal and viceroyal residence of Rideau Hall to Parliament Hill, where he introduced to the gathered crowd the Queen&#x27;s coronation speech, broadcast around the world via radio. He also gave a silver spoon to each child born on that day.

Massey welcomed the Queen and her consort, the Duke of Edinburgh, to Ottawa on three occasions from 1957 on; when the royal couple were engaged in a cross-country tour, Massey invited them to stay at his private estate, Batterwood, near Port Hope, Ontario. He also hosted a number of foreign heads of state, including United States president Dwight D. Eisenhower on November 13, 1953. As a return gesture, Massey was invited by Eisenhower to Washington, D.C., where, on May 4, 1954, he addressed a joint session of the United States Congress.
It was Massey&#x27;s intent as governor general to work to unite Canada&#x27;s diverse cultures. He travelled across the country, using any and all available transportation, including canoe and dog sled, and delivered speeches promoting bilingualism, some 20 years before it became an official national policy. Some of his notable ceremonial duties included opening in 1955 the new home of the Royal Saskatchewan Museum and, with his 1958 Dominion Day speech, inaugurating the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s first national televised broadcast. Massey also toured the Canadian arctic extensively, journeying to such places as Frobisher Bay and Hall Beach in the Northwest Territories, meeting with local Inuit residents, participating in their activities, and watching their performances. During his governor generalship, Massey also became actively involved with Upper Canada College, donating funds and his time to the school and seeing a number of spaces there named in his honour in return. As part of his effort to unify Canadians, it was Massey&#x27;s desire to see established an entirely Canadian honours system. Though such a thing was never realised during his viceregal tenure, he helped lay the groundwork for the system that would be implemented by his successor, and in 1967, just months before his death, Massey was inducted as one of the first companions of the Order of Canada.

===Promoting culture===
Biographer Claude Bissell believed that Massey&#x27;s most influential years were between 1949 and 1959, when Massey &quot;made his major contribution. More than any other Canadian, he was responsible for the first major movement of the arts and letters from the periphery of national concern towards the centre. It was a notable achievement.&quot; In this vein, Massey created awards for artistic endeavours, such as the Governor General&#x27;s Medals in Architecture, and promoted the concept of an annual, national arts festival, which eventually led to the founding of the National Arts Centre. Further, Massey initiated in 1954 the Governor General&#x27;s gold medal for the Institute of Chartered Accountants, as well as in 1959 the Massey Medal, for excellence in geographic endeavours for the Royal Canadian Geographical Society.

==Post-viceregal life and death==
Upon his final departure from Rideau Hall as governor general, Massey retired to Batterwood House, in the village of Canton, near Port Hope, Ontario. For his service to the Crown, he was awarded from the Queen the Royal Victorian Chain, making him the second commoner or non-head of state, the first Canadian, and one of the only two Canadians to have ever received the honour. Just prior to the end of his time as governor general, the Queen wrote to Massey: &quot;I wish to send you my congratulations and my sincere thanks for the manner in which you have discharged [your] duties. I know that as my personal representative you have always sought to maintain the right relationship between the Crown and the people of Canada. I am grateful to you for this because I regard it as the most important function among the many duties of the appointment which you have held with such distinction.&quot; The Queen had wanted to appoint Massey as a Knight of the Order of the Garter, but Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, after consulting the rest of Cabinet, advised the Queen against conferring the honour.

Massey continued his philanthropic work, dedicating his time to the stewardship of the Massey Foundation, and its endowment to the University of Toronto, in particular. His donation of Hart House to the University of Toronto stipulated that the building be restricted to men only, and it was not until after his death that the deed of gift was altered to allow for women becoming full members in 1972. While Hart House continued as one of the recipients of Massey&#x27;s attention and funds, Massey also expanded the scope of his donations to U of T with the establishment in 1963 of Massey College, to which Massey&#x27;s protégé, Robertson Davies, was appointed as the college&#x27;s first master. In 1961, the Massey Lectures were also initiated, conceived as a focus on important contemporary issues by leading thinkers, and they remain considered as the most important public lecture series in Canada.

At the end of 1967, on December 30, Massey died while on holiday in the United Kingdom. His remains were returned to Canada and he was, as is customary for former governors general, given a state funeral, in early January 1968. He was buried alongside his wife at historic St. Mark&#x27;s Church in Port Hope; his was among the last burials permitted in the small cemetery (Farley Mowat was interred in 2014).

<text>Melungeon ( ) (sometimes also spelled Malungean, Melangean, Melungean, Melungin) was a slur historically applied to individuals and families of mixed-race ancestry with roots in colonial Virginia, Tennessee, and North Carolina primarily descended from free people of color and white settlers. In modern times, the term has been reclaimed by descendants of these families, especially in southern Appalachia. Despite this mixed heritage, many modern Melungeons pass as white, as did many of their ancestors.

Despite often being white passing, the impact of the one-drop rule either did, or had the potential to, label many Melungeons as non-white. This redesignation resulted in some individuals being sterilized by state governments, most notably in Virginia.

Many groups have historically been referred to as Melungeon, including the Melungeons of Newman&#x27;s Ridge, the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina, the Chestnut Ridge people, and the Carmel Indians.

Free people of color in colonial Virginia were predominantly of African and European descent; however, many families also had varying amounts of Native American and East Indian ancestry.

Some modern researchers believe that early Atlantic Creole slaves, descended from or acculturated by Iberian lançados and Sephardi Jews fleeing the Inquisition, were one of the pre-cursor populations to these groups. Many creoles, once in British America, were able to obtain their freedom and many married into local white families.

In the general US census, Melungeon people were enumerated as of the races to which they most resembled.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;Melungeon&quot; likely comes from the French word &quot;mélange&quot; ultimately derived from the Latin verb &quot;miscēre&quot; (&quot;to mix, mingle, intermingle&quot;). It was once a derogatory term, but is used by the Melungeon people today as a primary identifier. The Tennessee Encyclopedia states that in the 19th century, &quot;the word &#x27;Melungeon&#x27; appears to have been used as an offensive term for nonwhite and/or low socioeconomic class persons by outsiders.&quot;

The term &quot;Melungeon&quot; was historically considered an insult, a label applied to Appalachians who were by appearance or reputation of mixed-race ancestry. Although initially pejorative in character, this word has been reclaimed by members of the community. The spelling of the term varied widely, as was common for words and names at the time.

According to the 1894 Department of Interior Report of Indians Taxed and not Taxed within the &quot;Tennessee&quot; report, &quot;The civilized (self-supporting) Indians of Tennessee, counted in the general census numbered 146 (71 males and 75 females) and are distributed as follows: Hawkins county, 31; Monroe county, 12; Polk county, 10; other counties (8 or less in each), 93. Quoting from the report:The Melungeans or Malungeans, in Hawkins county, claim to be Cherokees of mixed blood (white, Indian, and negro), their white blood being derived, as they assert, from English and Portuguese stock. They trace their descent primarily to 2 Indians (Cherokees) known, one of them as Collins, the other as Gibson, who settled in the mountains of Tennessee, where their descendants are now to be found, about the time of the admission of that state into the Union (1796).

===Early uses===
The earliest historical record of the term &quot;Melungeon&quot; dates to 1813. In the minutes of the Stoney Creek Baptist Church in Scott County, Virginia, a woman stated another parishioner made the accusation that &quot;she harbored them Melungins.&quot; The second oldest written use of the term was in 1840, when a Tennessee politician described &quot;an impudent Melungeon&quot; from what became Washington, D.C., as being &quot;a scoundrel who is half Negro and half Indian.&quot; In the 1890s, during the age of yellow journalism, the term &quot;Melungeon&quot; started to circulate and be reproduced in U.S. newspapers, when the journalist Will Allen Dromgoole wrote several articles on the Melungeons.

In 1894, the US Department of the Interior, in its &quot;Report of Indians Taxed and Not Taxed,&quot; under the section &quot;Tennessee&quot; noted: In a number of states small groups of people, preferring the freedom of the woods or the seashore to the confinement of regular labor in civilization, have become in some degree distinct from their neighbors, perpetuating their qualities and absorbing into their number those of like disposition, without preserving very clear racial lines. Such are the remnants called Indians in some states where a pure-blooded Indian can hardly longer be found. In Tennessee is such a group, popularly known as Melungeans, in addition to those still known as Cherokees. The name seems to have been given them by early French settlers, who recognized their mixed origin and applied to them the name Melangeans or Melungeans, a corruption of the French word &quot;melange&quot; which means mixed. (See letter of Hamilton McMillan, under North Carolina.)

==History==

In December 1943, Walter Ashby Plecker of Virginia sent county officials a letter warning against &quot;colored&quot; families trying to pass as &quot;white&quot; or &quot;Indian&quot; in violation of the Racial Integrity Act of 1924. He identified these as being &quot;chiefly Tennessee Melungeons&quot;. He directed the offices to reclassify members of certain families as black, causing the loss for numerous families of documentation in records that showed their continued self-identification as being of Native American descent on official forms.

In the 20th century, during the Jim Crow era, some Melungeons attended boarding schools in Asheville, North Carolina, Warren Wilson College, and Dorland Institution which integrated earlier than other schools in the southern United States.

===Civil War===
Many free people of color, white-passing or otherwise, served in the American Civil War on both sides of the conflict. Some served in the Confederate military, though others resisted the Confederate government, such as Henry Berry Lowry.

==Culture==
There is no uniquely Melungeon culture, though specific groups have formed into their own tribal entities on the basis of ancestral connections to historical Native American communities.

Due to the lasting impact of colonialism, the decimation of initial contact tribes, and the legacy of American chattel slavery, culturally these mixed-race groups resemble their white settler neighbors in culture, with few exceptions.

Melungeon cuisine includes chocolate gravy.

==Melungeon families==
Definitions of who is Melungeon differ. Historians and genealogists have tried to identify surnames of different Melungeon families. In 1943, Virginia State Registrar of Vital Statistics, Walter Ashby Plecker, identified surnames by county: &quot;Lee, Smyth and Wise: Collins, Gibson, (Gipson), Moore, Goins, Ramsey, Delph, Bunch, Freeman, Mise, Barlow, Bolden (Bolin), Mullins, Hawkins (chiefly Tennessee Melungeons)&quot;.

In 1992, Virginia DeMarce explored and reported the Goins genealogy as a Melungeon surname. Beginning in the early 19th century, or possibly before, the term Melungeon was applied as a slur to a group of about 40 families along the Tennessee-Virginia border, but it has since become a catch-all phrase for a number of groups of mysterious mixed-race ancestry. Through time the term has changed meanings but often referred to any mixed-race person and, at different times, has referred to 200 different communities across the Eastern United States. These have included Van Guilders and Clappers of New York and Lumbees in North Carolina to Creoles in Louisiana.

==Claims==
Anthropologist E. Raymond Evans wrote in 1979 regarding Melungeons: &quot;In Graysville, the Melungeons strongly deny their Black heritage and explain their genetic differences by claiming to have had Cherokee grandmothers. Many of the local Whites also claim Cherokee ancestry and appear to accept the Melungeon claim. ...&quot;

In 1999, historian C. S. Everett hypothesized that John Collins (recorded as a Sapony Indian who was expelled from Orange County, Virginia about January 1743), might be the same man as the Melungeon ancestor John Collins, who was classified as a &quot;mulatto&quot; in 1755 North Carolina records. However, Everett revised that theory after he discovered evidence that these were two different men named John Collins. Only descendants of the latter man, who was identified as mulatto in the 1755 record in North Carolina, have any proven connection to the Melungeon families of eastern Tennessee.

Jack D. Forbes speculated that the Melungeons may have been Saponi/Powhatan descendants, although he acknowledges an account from circa 1890 described them as being &quot;free colored&quot; and mulatto people.

===Myths===
Dispute regarding the origin of Melungeons families has led to a large number of ahistorical and dubious myths regarding their origins. Some myths involve physical characteristics and genetic diseases that are claimed to indicate Melungeon descent, such as shovel-shaped incisors, an Anatolian bump, Familial Mediterranean fever, polydactyly, dark skin with bright colored eyes, and high cheekbones.

Other myths claim that the Melungeons are descendants of lost Spanish colonists, marooned Portuguese sailors, descendants of the ancient Israelites or Phoenicians, Romani slaves, or Turkish settlers.

==Genetic testing==
From 2005 to 2011, researchers Roberta J. Estes, Jack H. Goins, Penny Ferguson, and Janet Lewis Crain began the Melungeon Core Y-DNA Group online. They interpreted these results in their (2011) paper titled &quot;Melungeons, A Multi-Ethnic Population&quot;, which shows that ancestry of the sample is primarily European and African, with one person having a Native American paternal haplotype.

Estes, Goins, Ferguson, and Crain wrote in their 2011 summary &quot;Melungeons, A Multi-Ethnic Population&quot; that the Riddle family is the only Melungeon participant with historical records identifying them as having Native American origins, but their DNA is European. Among the participants, only the Sizemore family is documented as having Native American DNA. &quot;Estes and her fellow researchers &quot;theorize that the various Melungeon lines may have sprung from the unions of black and white indentured servants living in Virginia in the mid-1600s, before slavery. They conclude that as laws were put in place to penalize the mixing of races, the various family groups could only intermarry with each other, even migrating together from Virginia through the Carolinas before settling primarily in the mountains of East Tennessee.&quot;

===Possible origins===
Although each group has its own unique admixtures, there have been several points made that might adequately explain a lot of them. On top of this, during the 19th and 20th centuries, many such communities began breaking up and scattering across much of the country, leading to some mixing occurring between many such racially ambiguous groups. 

Between approximately 1700-1820, as the Carolinas, Georgia and Appalachia began to be settled, America solidified its interest in the slave trade. As a large part of their attempts to justify slavery of blacks, they cited their inability to read and write, among other aspects that made them less advanced or civilized than Europeans. But, this wasn&#x27;t always the case- some of the people who were enslaved were able to read and write in Arabic, which upset and confused many American colonial settlers at each instance they were discovered. Several such people were known to have escaped, disappeared into Appalachia and may have taken refuge amongst Native Americans or formed their own communities. These slaves were most likely related to the Songhai people, neighbors to Benin, the nation where the American colonies sourced their African slaves, who were and still are today a Muslim majority people. If so, this would explain both the black ancestry and the claims of Turkish ancestry amongst some groups. There is well documented evidence showing those Melungeons who lived near Native American communities, particularly between Virginia and South Carolina, came to be very deeply ingrained into these communities, whether they intermarried or not. 

Among the Scots-Irish and German immigrants who settled Appalachia, there were also a fair minority of both who had the ability to tan. Amongst the Scots-Irish, descendants of the people around where Scotland, England and Wales meet, these are referred to as the &quot;Black Irish&quot;, despite no such people existing amongst the actual Irish. A primary source told researchers, &quot;They would say they were &quot;Black Dutch&quot; or &quot;Black Irish&quot; or &quot;Black French&quot;, or Native American. They’d say they were anything but Melungeon because anything else would be better ... because to be Melungeon was to be discriminated against.&quot; Amongst the Germans, they are usually just referred to as Black or Swarthy, but a new term sprang up in both Australia and Appalachia- Black Dutch. As many mixed Australians began identifying heavily as Black Dutch to avoid discrimination, some mixed persons in Appalachia followed suit. But, over time, the connotation of being Black Dutch started leading to just as much discrimination and a will amongst white Appalachians to shun anyone they thought might be mixed off into their own separate groups. This caused some people of Native American ancestry (although rare) and authentic Black Irish or Black Dutch ancestry to all merge into one group. In some cases, other misaligned groups of recent immigrants who ended up in Appalachia, such as Italians, were also shunned into these same communities. 

Many such people with alleged Native ancestry claim to either be Cherokee or Blackfoot. Cherokee derives from the slang use of Cherokee in early West Virginia and Kentucky to mean Native American in general, with many records from these places showing all tribes encountered occasionally referred to as Cherokees. Blackfoot is more confusing, as the term is clearly as old as pre-1830, when the Indian Removal Act forced the actual Cherokee off their land, but is nonsensical.

==Racial laws and court cases==
Melungeon ancestors were considered by appearance to be mixed race. During the 18th and the early 19th centuries, census enumerators classified them as &quot;mulatto,&quot; &quot;other free,&quot; or as &quot;free persons of color.&quot; Sometimes they were listed as &quot;white&quot; or sometimes as &quot;black&quot; or &quot;negro,&quot; or even &quot;Indian.&quot; One family described as &quot;Indian&quot; was the Ridley (Riddle) family, as was noted on a 1767 Pittsylvania County, Virginia, tax list. Another tri-racial family described as “Indian” was the Butler family, as was noted in the 1860 census for Whitley County, Kentucky, with the family patriarch (named Simon Butler) being born in Tennessee around 1776.

Ariela Gross referenced the 1846 &quot;State v. Solomon, Ezekial, Levi, Andrew, Wiatt, Vardy Collins, Zachariah, Lewis Minor&quot;, Hawkins County Circuit Court Minute Book, 1842–1848, Hawkins County Circuit Court, Hawkins County Courthouse box 31, 32 and the Jacob F. Perkins vs. John R. White, Carter County, July 1855 Abstract of depositions to support her conclusions made about identity and citizenship in 19th-century United States.

In 1924, Virginia passed the Racial Integrity Act that codified hypodescent or the &quot;one-drop rule, suggesting that anyone with any trace of African ancestry was legally Black and would fall under Jim Crow laws designed to limit the freedoms and rights of Black people. Anti-miscegenation laws in the United States were not declared unconstitutional until the 1967 &quot;Loving v. Virginia&quot; case.

==Modern identity==
By the mid-to-late 19th century, the term Melungeon appeared to have been used most frequently to refer to the biracial families of Hancock County and neighboring areas. Several other uses of the term in the print media, from the mid-19th to the early 20th centuries, have been collected by the Melungeon Heritage Association.

Since the mid-1990s, popular interest in the Melungeons has grown tremendously, although many descendants have left the region of historical concentration. The writer Bill Bryson devoted the better part of a chapter to them in his &quot;The Lost Continent&quot; (1989). People are increasingly self-identifying as having Melungeon ancestry. Internet sites promote the anecdotal claim that Melungeons are more prone to certain diseases, such as sarcoidosis or familial Mediterranean fever. Academic medical centers have noted that neither of those diseases is confined to a single population.

==Literature==

Author Jesse Stuart&#x27;s 1965 novel &quot;Daughter of the Legend&quot;, set in Tennessee, depicts a love story between a Melungeon girl and a timber cutter from Virginia, and explores socioeconomic and racial tensions among mountain-dwelling families.

A Melungeon character is the titular protagonist and narrator of Barbara Kingsolver&#x27;s &quot;Demon Copperhead&quot;, which was a co-recipient of the 2023 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. The novel takes place primarily in Lee County, Virginia and environs.

A character of Melungeon descent, Pearl Grimes, is pivotal in Adriana Trigiani&#x27;s novel (and the romantic comedy film derived from that novel) “Big Stone Gap,” which is set in Trigiani&#x27;s hometown Big Stone Gap, Virginia.

<text>Ambisonics is a &quot;full-sphere&quot; surround sound format: in addition to the horizontal plane, it covers sound sources above and below the listener. 

Unlike some other multichannel surround formats, its transmission channels do not carry speaker signals. Instead, they contain a speaker-independent representation of a sound field called &quot;B-format&quot;, which is then &quot;decoded&quot; to the listener&#x27;s speaker setup. This extra step allows the producer to think in terms of source directions rather than loudspeaker positions, and offers the listener a considerable degree of flexibility as to the layout and number of speakers used for playback.

Ambisonics was developed in the UK in the 1970s under the auspices of the British National Research Development Corporation.

Despite its solid technical foundation and many advantages, Ambisonics had not until recently been a commercial success, and survived only in niche applications and among recording enthusiasts.

With the widespread availability of powerful digital signal processing (as opposed to the expensive and error-prone analog circuitry that had to be used during its early years) and the successful market introduction of home theatre surround sound systems since the 1990s, interest in Ambisonics among recording engineers, sound designers, composers, media companies, broadcasters and researchers has returned and continues to increase. 

In particular, it has proved an effective way to present spatial audio in Virtual Reality applications (e.g. YouTube 360 Video), as the B-Format scene can be rotated to match the user&#x27;s head orientation, and then be decoded as binaural stereo.

== Introduction ==
Ambisonics can be understood as a three-dimensional extension of M/S (mid/side) stereo, adding additional difference channels for height and depth. The resulting signal set is called &quot;B-format&quot;. Its component channels are labelled formula_1 for the sound pressure (the M in M/S), formula_2 for the front-minus-back sound pressure gradient, formula_3 for left-minus-right (the S in M/S) and formula_4 for up-minus-down.

The formula_1 signal corresponds to an omnidirectional microphone, whereas formula_6 are the components that would be picked up by figure-of-eight capsules oriented along the three spatial axes.

=== Panning a source ===
A simple Ambisonic panner (or &quot;encoder&quot;) takes a source signal formula_7 and two parameters, the horizontal angle formula_8 and the elevation angle formula_9. It positions the source at the desired angle by distributing the signal over the Ambisonic components with different gains:

:formula_10
:formula_11
:formula_12
:formula_13

Being omnidirectional, the formula_1 channel always gets the same constant input signal, regardless of the angles. So that it has more-or-less the same average energy as the other channels, W is attenuated by about 3 dB (precisely, divided by the square root of two). The terms for formula_6 actually produce the polar patterns of figure-of-eight microphones (see illustration on the right, second row). We take their value at formula_8 and formula_9, and multiply the result with the input signal. The result is that the input ends up in all components exactly as loud as the corresponding microphone would have picked it up.

=== Virtual microphones ===

The B-format components can be combined to derive &quot;virtual microphones&quot; with any first-order polar pattern (omnidirectional, cardioid, hypercardioid, figure-of-eight or anything in between) pointing in any direction. Several such microphones with different parameters can be derived at the same time, to create coincident stereo pairs (such as a Blumlein) or surround arrays.

A horizontal virtual microphone at horizontal angle formula_18 with pattern formula_19 is given by

:formula_20.

This virtual mic is &quot;free-field normalised&quot;, which means it has a constant gain of one for on-axis sounds. The illustration on the left shows some examples created with this formula.

Virtual microphones can be manipulated in post-production: desired sounds can be picked out, unwanted ones suppressed, and the balance between direct and reverberant sound can be fine-tuned during mixing.
=== Decoding ===

A basic Ambisonic &quot;decoder&quot; is very similar to a set of virtual microphones. For perfectly regular layouts, a simplified decoder can be generated by pointing a virtual cardioid microphone in the direction of each speaker. Here is a square:
:formula_21
:formula_22
:formula_23
:formula_24
The signs of the formula_2 and formula_3 components are the important part, the rest are gain factors. The formula_4 component is discarded, because it is not possible to reproduce height cues with just four loudspeakers in one plane.

In practice, a real Ambisonic decoder requires a number of psycho-acoustic optimisations to work properly.

Currently, the All-Round Ambisonic Decoder (AllRAD) can be regarded as the standard solution for loudspeaker-based playback, and Magnitude Least Squares (MagLS) or binaural decoding, as implemented for instance in the IEM and SPARTA Ambisonic production tools.

Frequency-dependent decoding can also be used to produce binaural stereo; this is particularly relevant in Virtual Reality applications.

=== Higher-order Ambisonics ===

The spatial resolution of first-order Ambisonics as described above is quite low. In practice, that translates to slightly blurry sources, but also to a comparably small usable listening area or &quot;sweet spot&quot;. The resolution can be increased and the sweet spot enlarged by adding groups of more selective directional components to the B-format. These no longer correspond to conventional microphone polar patterns, but rather look like clover leaves. The resulting signal set is then called &quot;Second-&quot;, &quot;Third-&quot;, or collectively, &quot;Higher-order Ambisonics&quot;.

For a given order formula_28, full-sphere systems require formula_29 signal components, and formula_30 components are needed for horizontal-only reproduction.

Historically there have been several different format conventions for higher-order Ambisonics; for details see Ambisonic data exchange formats.

=== Comparison to other surround formats ===
Ambisonics differs from other surround formats in a number of aspects:

* It requires only three channels for basic horizontal surround, and four channels for a full-sphere soundfield. Basic full-sphere replay requires a minimum of six loudspeakers (a minimum of four for horizontal).
*The same program material can be decoded for varying numbers of loudspeakers. Moreover, a width-height mix can be played back on horizontal-only, stereo or even mono systems without losing content entirely (it will be folded to the horizontal plane and to the frontal quadrant, respectively). This allows producers to embrace with-height production without worrying about loss of information.
* Ambisonics can be scaled to any desired spatial resolution at the cost of additional transmission channels and more speakers for playback. Higher-order material remains downwards compatible and can be played back at lower spatial resolution without requiring a special downmix.
* The core technology of Ambisonics is free of patents, and a complete tool chain for production and listening is available as free software for all major operating systems.

On the downside, Ambisonics is:

* Prone to strong coloration from comb filtering artifacts due to high coherence of neighbouring loudspeaker signals at lower orders
* Unable to deliver the particular spaciousness of spaced omnidirectional microphones preferred by many classical sound engineers and listeners
* Not supported by any major record label or media company. Although a number of Ambisonic UHJ format (UHJ) encoded tracks (principally classical) can be located, if with some difficulty, on services such as Spotify..
* Conceptually difficult for people to grasp, as opposed to the conventional &quot;one channel, one speaker&quot; paradigm.
* More complicated for the consumer to set up, because of the decoding stage.
* Sweet spot which is not found in other forms of surround sound such as VBAP
* Worse localisation for point sources than amplitude panning and counter phase signals blurring imaging
* Much more sensitive to speaker placement than other forms of surround sound that use amplitude panning

== Theoretical foundation ==

=== Soundfield analysis (encoding) ===
The B-format signals comprise a truncated spherical harmonic decomposition of the sound field. They correspond to the sound pressure formula_1, and the three components of the pressure gradient formula_6 (not to be confused with the related particle velocity) at a point in space. Together, these approximate the sound field on a sphere around the microphone; formally the first-order truncation of the multipole expansion. formula_1 (the mono signal) is the zero-order information, corresponding to a constant function on the sphere, while formula_6 are the first-order terms (the dipoles or figures-of-eight). This first-order truncation is only an approximation of the overall sound field.

The &quot;higher orders&quot; correspond to further terms of the multipole expansion of a function on the sphere in terms of spherical harmonics. In practice, higher orders require more speakers for playback, but increase the spatial resolution and enlarge the area where the sound field is reproduced perfectly (up to an upper boundary frequency).

The radius formula_35 of this area for Ambisonic order formula_28 and frequency formula_37 is given by
:formula_38,
where formula_39 denotes the speed of sound.

This area becomes smaller than a human head above 600 Hz for first order or 1800 Hz for third-order. Accurate reproduction in a head-sized volume up to 20 kHz would require an order of 32 or more than 1000 loudspeakers.

At those frequencies and listening positions where perfect soundfield reconstruction is no longer possible, Ambisonics reproduction has to focus on delivering correct directional cues to allow for good localisation even in the presence of reconstruction errors.

=== Psychoacoustics ===
The human hearing apparatus has very keen localisation on the horizontal plane (as fine as 2° source separation in some experiments). Two predominant cues, for different frequency ranges, can be identified:

==== Low-frequency localisation ====
At low frequencies, where the wavelength is large compared to the human head, an incoming sound diffracts around it, so that there is virtually no acoustic shadow and hence no level difference between the ears. In this range, the only available information is the phase relationship between the two ear signals, called &quot;interaural time difference&quot;, or &quot;ITD&quot;. Evaluating this time difference allows for precise localisation within a &quot;cone of confusion&quot;: the angle of incidence is unambiguous, but the ITD is the same for sounds from the front or from the back. As long as the sound is not totally unknown to the subject, the confusion can usually be resolved by perceiving the timbral front-back variations caused by the ear flaps (or &quot;pinnae&quot;).

==== High-frequency localisation ====
As the wavelength approaches twice the size of the head, phase relationships become ambiguous, since it is no longer clear whether the phase difference between the ears corresponds to one, two, or even more periods as the frequency goes up. Fortunately, the head will create a significant acoustic shadow in this range, which causes a slight difference in level between the ears. This is called the &quot;interaural level difference&quot;, or &quot;ILD&quot; (the same cone of confusion applies). Combined, these two mechanisms provide localisation over the entire hearing range.

==== ITD and ILD reproduction in Ambisonics ====
Gerzon has shown that the quality of localisation cues in the reproduced sound field corresponds to two objective metrics: the length of the particle velocity vector formula_40 for the ITD, and the length of the energy vector formula_41 for the ILD. Gerzon and Barton (1992) define a decoder for horizontal surround to be &quot;Ambisonic&quot; if
* the directions of formula_40 and formula_41 agree up to at least 4 kHz,
* at frequencies below about 400 Hz, formula_44 for all azimuth angles, and
* at frequencies from about 700 Hz to 4 kHz, the magnitude of formula_41 is &quot;substantially maximised across as large a part of the 360° sound stage as possible&quot;.

In practice, satisfactory results are achieved at moderate orders even for very large listening areas.

==== Monoaural HRTF cue ====

Humans are also able to derive information about sound source location in 3D-space, taking into account height. Much of this ability is due to the shape of the head (especially the pinna) producing a variable frequency response depending on the angle of the source. The response can be measured by placing a microphone in a person&#x27;s ear canal, then playing back sounds from various directions. The recorded head-related transfer function (HRTF) can then be used for rendering ambisonics to headphones, mimicking the effect of the head. HRTFs differ among person to person due to head shape variations, but a generic one can produce a satisfactory result.

=== Soundfield synthesis (decoding) ===
In principle, the loudspeaker signals are derived by using a linear combination of the Ambisonic component signals, where each signal is dependent on the actual position of the speaker in relation to the center of an imaginary sphere the surface of which passes through all available speakers. In practice, slightly irregular distances of the speakers may be compensated with delay.

True Ambisonics decoding however requires spatial equalisation of the signals to account for the differences in the high- and low-frequency sound localisation mechanisms in human hearing. A further refinement accounts for the distance of the listener from the loudspeakers (&quot;near-field compensation&quot;).
A variety of more modern decoding methods are also in use.

== Compatibility with existing distribution channels ==
Ambisonics decoders are not currently being marketed to end users in any significant way, and no native Ambisonic recordings are commercially available. Hence, content that has been produced in Ambisonics must be made available to consumers in stereo or discrete multichannel formats.

=== Stereo ===
Ambisonics content can be folded down to stereo automatically, without requiring a dedicated downmix. The most straightforward approach is to sample the B-format with a &quot;virtual stereo microphone&quot;. The result is equivalent to a coincident stereo recording. Imaging will depend on the microphone geometry, but usually rear sources will be reproduced more softly and diffuse. Vertical information (from the formula_4 channel) is omitted.

Alternatively, the B-format can be matrix-encoded into &quot;UHJ format&quot;, which is suitable for direct playback on stereo systems. As before, the vertical information will be discarded, but in addition to left-right reproduction, UHJ tries to retain some of the horizontal surround information by translating sources in the back into out-of-phase signals. This gives the listener some sense of rear localisation.

Two-channel UHJ can also be decoded back into horizontal Ambisonics (with some loss of accuracy), if an Ambisonic playback system is available. Lossless UHJ up to four channels (including height information) exists but has never seen wide use. In all UHJ schemes, the first two channels are conventional left and right speaker feeds.

=== Multichannel formats ===
Likewise, it is possible to pre-decode Ambisonics material to arbitrary speaker layouts, such as Quad, 5.1, 7.1, Auro 11.1, or even 22.2, again without manual intervention. The LFE channel is either omitted, or a special mix is created manually. Pre-decoding to 5.1 media has been known as &quot;&quot; during the early days of DVD audio, although the term is not in common use anymore.

The obvious advantage of pre-decoding is that any surround listener can be able to experience Ambisonics; no special hardware is required beyond that found in a common home theatre system. The main disadvantage is that the flexibility of rendering a single, standard Ambisonics signal to any target speaker array is lost: the signal is assumes a specific &quot;standard&quot; layout and anyone listening with a different array may experience a degradation of localisation accuracy.

Target layouts from 5.1 upwards usually surpass the spatial resolution of first-order Ambisonics, at least in the frontal quadrant. For optimal resolution, to avoid excessive crosstalk, and to steer around irregularities of the target layout, pre-decodings for such targets should be derived from source material in higher-order Ambisonics.

== Production workflow ==
Ambisonic content can be created in two basic ways: by recording a sound with a suitable first- or higher-order microphone, or by taking separate monophonic sources and panning them to the desired positions. Content can also be manipulated while it is in B-format.

=== Ambisonic microphones ===

==== Native B-format arrays ====

Since the components of first-order Ambisonics correspond to physical microphone pickup patterns, it is entirely practical to record B-format directly, with three coincident microphones: an omnidirectional capsule, one forward-facing figure-8 capsule, and one left-facing figure-8 capsule, yielding the formula_1, formula_2 and formula_3 components. This is referred to as a &quot;native&quot; or &quot;Nimbus/Halliday&quot; microphone array, after its designer Dr Jonathan Halliday at Nimbus Records, where it is used to record their extensive and continuing series of Ambisonic releases. An integrated native B-format microphone, the C700S has been manufactured and sold by Josephson Engineering since 1990.

The primary difficulty inherent in this approach is that high-frequency localisation and clarity relies on the diaphragms approaching true coincidence. By stacking the capsules vertically, perfect coincidence for horizontal sources is obtained. However, sound from above or below will theoretically suffer from subtle comb filtering effects in the highest frequencies. In most instances this is not a limitation as sound sources far from the horizontal plane are typically from room reverberation. In addition, stacked figure-8 microphone elements have a deep null in the direction of their stacking axis such that the primary transducer in those directions is the central omnidirectional microphone. In practice this can produce less localisation error than either of the alternatives (tetrahedral arrays with processing, or a fourth microphone for the Z axis.)

Native arrays are most commonly used for horizontal-only surround, because of increasing positional errors and shading effects when adding a fourth microphone.

==== The tetrahedral microphone ====
Since it is impossible to build a perfectly coincident microphone array, the next-best approach is to minimize and distribute the positional error as uniformly as possible. This can be achieved by arranging four cardioid or sub-cardioid capsules in a tetrahedron and equalising for uniform diffuse-field response. The capsule signals are then converted to B-format with a matrix operation.

Outside Ambisonics, tetrahedral microphones have become popular with location recording engineers working in stereo or 5.1 for their flexibility in post-production; here, the B-format is only used as an intermediate to derive virtual microphones.

==== Higher-order microphones ====
Above first-order, it is no longer possible to obtain Ambisonic components directly with single microphone capsules. Instead, higher-order difference signals are derived from several spatially distributed (usually omnidirectional) capsules using very sophisticated digital signal processing. 

The ZYLIA ZM-1 is a commercially available microphone capable of generating third-order ambisonic recordings, using 19 omni-directional capsules.

The em64 Eigenmike from mh acoustics is a 64-channel spherical microphone array capable of sixth-order capture. The production of the em64 has superseded their previous em32 microphone.

A recent paper by Peter Craven et al. (subsequently patented) describes the use of bi-directional capsules for higher order microphones to reduce the extremity of the equalisation involved. No microphones have yet been made using this idea.

=== Ambisonic panning ===
The most straightforward way to produce Ambisonic mixes of arbitrarily high order is to take monophonic sources and position them with an Ambisonic encoder.

A full-sphere encoder usually has two parameters, azimuth (or horizon) and elevation angle. The encoder will distribute the source signal to the Ambisonic components such that, when decoded, the source will appear at the desired location. More sophisticated panners will additionally provide a radius parameter that will take care of distance-dependent attenuation and bass boost due to near-field effect.

Hardware panning units and mixers for first-order Ambisonics have been available since the 1980s and have been used commercially. Today, panning plugins and other related software tools are available for all major digital audio workstations, often as free software. However, due to arbitrary bus width restrictions, few professional digital audio workstations (DAW) support orders higher than second. Notable exceptions are REAPER, Pyramix, ProTools, Nuendo and Ardour.

=== Ambisonic manipulation ===

First order B-format can be manipulated in various ways to change the contents of an auditory scene. Well known manipulations include &quot;rotation&quot; and &quot;dominance&quot; (moving sources towards or away from a particular direction).

Additionally, linear time-invariant signal processing such as equalisation can be applied to B-format without disrupting sound directions, as long as it applied to all component channels equally.

More recent developments in higher order Ambisonics enable a wide range of manipulations including rotation, reflection, movement, 3D reverb, upmixing from legacy formats such as 5.1 or first order, visualisation and directionally-dependent masking and equalisation.

=== Data exchange ===

Transmitting Ambisonic B-format between devices and to end-users requires a standardized exchange format. While &quot;traditional first-order B-format&quot; is well-defined and universally understood, there are conflicting conventions for higher-order Ambisonics, differing both in channel order and weighting, which might need to be supported for some time. Traditionally, the most widespread is &quot;Furse-Malham higher order format&quot; in the codice_1 container based on Microsoft&#x27;s WAVE-EX file format. It scales up to third order and has a file size limitation of 4GB.

New implementations and productions might want to consider the AmbiX proposal, which adopts the codice_2 file format and does away with the 4GB limit. It scales to arbitrarily high orders and is based on SN3D encoding. SN3D encoding has been adopted by Google as the basis for its YouTube 360 format.
=== Compressed distribution ===
To effectively distribute Ambisonic data to non-professionals, lossy compression is desired to keep the data size acceptable. However, simple multi-mono compression is not sufficient, as lossy compression tends to destroy phase information and thus degrade localization in the form of spatial reduction, blur, and phantom source. Reduction of redundancy among channels is desired, not only to enhance compression, but also to reduce the risk of dicernable phase errors. (It is also possible to use post-processing to hide the artifacts.)

As with mid-side joint stereo encoding, a static matrixing scheme (as in Opus) is usable for first-order ambisonics, but not optimal in case of multiple sources. A number of schemes such as DirAC use a scheme similar to parametric stereo, where a downmixed signal is encoded, the principal direction recorded, and some description of ambiance added. MPEG-H 3D Audio, drawing on some work from MPEG Surround, extends the concept to handle multiple sources. MPEG-H uses principal component analysis to determine the main sources and then encodes a multi-mono signal corresponding to the principal directions. These parametric methods provide good quality, so long as they take good care in smoothing sound directions among frames. PCA/SVD is applicable for first-order as well as high-order ambisonics input.

== Current development ==

=== Open source === 
Since 2018 a free and open source implementation exists in the IEM Plugin Suite and the SPARTA suite that implement the recent academic developments and the sound codec Opus. Opus provides two channel encoding modes: one that simply stores channels individually, and another that weights the channels through a fixed, invertible matrix to reduce redundancy. A listening-test of Opus ambisonics was published in 2020, as calibration for AMBIQUAL, an objective metric for compressed ambisonics by Google. Opus third-order ambisonics at 256 kbps has similar localization accuracy compared to Opus first-order ambisonics at 128 kbps.

=== Corporate interest ===

Since its adoption by Google and other manufacturers as the audio format of choice for virtual reality, Ambisonics has seen a surge of interest.

In 2018, Sennheiser released its VR microphone, and Zoom released an Ambisonics Field Recorder. Both are implementations of the tetrahedral microphone design which produces first order Ambisonics.

A number of companies are currently conducting research in Ambisonics:
* BBC
* Technicolor Research and Innovation/Thomson Licensing

Dolby Laboratories have expressed &quot;interest&quot; in Ambisonics by acquiring (and liquidating) Barcelona-based Ambisonics specialist imm sound prior to launching Dolby Atmos, which, although its precise workings are undisclosed, does implement decoupling between source direction and actual loudspeaker positions. Atmos takes a fundamentally different approach in that it does not attempt to transmit a sound field; it transmits discrete premixes or stems (i.e., raw streams of sound data) along with metadata about what location and direction they should appear to be coming from. The stems are then decoded, mixed, and rendered in real time using whatever loudspeakers are available at the playback location.

=== Use in gaming ===
Higher-order Ambisonics has found a niche market in video games developed by Codemasters. Their first game to use an Ambisonic audio engine was Colin McRae: DiRT, however, this only used Ambisonics on the PlayStation 3 platform. Their game Race Driver: GRID extended the use of Ambisonics to the Xbox 360 platform, and Colin McRae: DiRT 2 uses Ambisonics on all platforms including the PC.

The recent games from Codemasters, F1 2010, Dirt 3, F1 2011 and , use fourth-order Ambisonics on faster PCs, rendered by Blue Ripple Sound&#x27;s Rapture3D OpenAL driver and pre-mixed Ambisonic audio produced using Bruce Wiggins&#x27; WigWare Ambisonic Plug-ins.

OpenAL Soft , a free and open source implementation of the OpenAL specification, also uses Ambisonics to render 3D audio. OpenAL Soft can often be used as a drop-in replacement for other OpenAL implementations, enabling several games that use the OpenAL API to benefit from rendering audio with Ambisonics.

For many games that do not make use of the OpenAL API natively, the use of a wrapper or a chain of wrappers can help to make these games indirectly use the OpenAL API. Ultimately, this leads to the sound being rendered in Ambisonics if a capable OpenAL driver such as OpenAL Soft is being used.

The Unreal Engine supports soundfield Ambisonics rendering since version 4.25. The Unity engine supports working with Ambisonics audio clips since version 2017.1.

== Patents and trademarks ==
Most of the patents covering Ambisonic developments have now expired (including those covering the Soundfield microphone) and, as a result, the basic technology is available for anyone to implement.

The &quot;pool&quot; of patents comprising Ambisonics technology was originally assembled by the UK Government&#x27;s National Research &amp; Development Corporation (NRDC), which existed until the late 1970s to develop and promote British inventions and license them to commercial manufacturers – ideally to a single licensee. The system was ultimately licensed to Nimbus Records (now owned by Wyastone Estate Ltd).

The &quot;interlocking circles&quot; Ambisonic logo (UK trademarks and ), and the text marks &quot;AMBISONIC&quot; and &quot;A M B I S O N&quot; (UK trademarks and ), formerly owned by Wyastone Estate Ltd., have expired as of 2010.

<text>Linux Journal (LJ) is an American monthly technology magazine originally published by Specialized System Consultants, Inc. (SSC) in Seattle, Washington since 1994. In December 2006 the publisher changed to Belltown Media, Inc. in Houston, Texas. Since 2017, the publisher was Linux Journal, LLC. located in Denver, Colorado. The magazine focused specifically on Linux, allowing the content to be a highly specialized source of information for open source enthusiasts. The magazine was published from March 1994 to August 2019, over 25 years, before being bought by Slashdot Media in 2020.

==History==
&quot;Linux Journal&quot; was the first magazine to be published about the Linux kernel and operating systems based on it. It was established in 1994. The first issue was published in March 1994 by Phil Hughes and Bob Young, who co-founded Red Hat, and it featured an interview with Linux creator Linus Torvalds.

The publication&#x27;s last print edition was August 2011, issue 208. Beginning with the September 2011 issue, issue 209, the magazine transitioned to publishing monthly in digital-only formats including various desktop, mobile, and e-pub platforms.

In early July 2014 it was revealed that the NSA&#x27;s XKeyscore program targeted readers of &quot;Linux Journal&quot; as part of targeting people interested in the Linux distribution Tails.

On December 1, 2017 &quot;Linux Journal&quot; announced that it would cease publication due to running out of funds, having fallen into debt and being unable to pay employees for months. However, on January 1, 2018, it announced that it was rescued by Private Internet Access/London Trust Media—which shares similar values—and that the magazine plans to grow: According to editor-in-chief Doc Searls: &quot;&quot;Linux Journal&quot; should be to Linux what &quot;National Geographic&quot; is to geography and &quot;The New Yorker&quot; is to New York—meaning about much more than the title alone suggests.&quot;

On August 7, 2019, the &quot;Journal&quot; announced that it would be shutting down and letting all staff go.

On September 22, 2020, &quot;Linux Journal&quot; resumed activity under the new management of Slashdot Media.

<text>PONTIFEX (Planning Of Non-specific Transportation by an Intelligent Fleet EXpert) was a mid-1980s project that introduced a novel approach to complex aircraft fleet scheduling, partially funded by the European Commission&#x27;s Strategic Programme for R&amp;D in Information Technology.

Since the mathematical problems stemming from nontrivial fleet scheduling easily become computationally unsolvable, the PONTIFEX idea consisted in a seamless merge of algorithms and heuristic knowledge embedded in rules. The system, based on domain knowledge collected from airliners Alitalia, KLM, Swissair, and TAP Portugal, was first adopted by Swissair and Alitalia in the late 1980s, then also by the Italian railroad national operator, for their cargo division. It was still in use .

<doc id="233840" wikidata="Q20198851" url="?curid=233840" title="Governor of Florida">
<text>The governor of Florida is the head of government of the U.S. state of Florida. The governor is the head of the executive branch of the government of Florida and is the commander-in-chief of the Florida National Guard. 

Established in the Constitution of Florida, the governor&#x27;s responsibilities include ensuring the enforcement of state laws, the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Florida Legislature, overseeing state agencies, issuing executive orders, proposing and overseeing the state budget, and making key appointments to state offices. The governor also has the power to call special sessions of the legislature and grant pardons, except in cases of impeachment.

When Florida was first acquired by the United States, future president Andrew Jackson served as its military governor. Florida Territory was established in 1822 and five people served as governor over 6 distinct terms. The first territorial governor, William Pope Duval, served 12 years, the longest of any Florida governor to date.

Since statehood in 1845, there have been 45 people who have served as governor, one of whom served two distinct terms. Four state governors have served two full four-year terms: William D. Bloxham, in two stints, as well as Reubin Askew, Jeb Bush and Rick Scott who each served their terms consecutively. Bob Graham almost served two full terms but resigned with three days left in his term in order to take a seat in the United States Senate. The shortest term in office belongs to Wayne Mixson, who served three days following Graham&#x27;s resignation.

The current officeholder is Ron DeSantis, a member of the Republican Party who took office on January 8, 2019.

== Eligibility and requirements ==
Article IV, Section 5(b), of the Florida Constitution states that, for a person to serve as governor, they must:

* Be at least thirty years old;
* Be a citizen of the United States;
* Be a permanent resident of Florida for at least seven years;
* Not have served as governor for six years or more of the two prior terms.

== Election, oath of office and removal ==
Governors of Florida are directly elected by registered voters in Florida and serve terms of four years, renewable once consecutively. Before executing the powers of the office, a governor is required to recite the oath of office as found in Article II, Section 5 of the Constitution of Florida: I,_____________, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support, protect, and defend the Constitution and Government of the United States and of the State of Florida; that I am duly qualified to hold office under the Constitution of the state; and that I will well and faithfully perform the duties of Governor on which I am now about to enter. So help me God.

=== Removal of a governor from office ===
The governor can be impeached by the State House of Representatives for committing treason, bribery, or any other high crime or misdemeanor. Once the governor is impeached, the case is forwarded to the State Senate for trial. A two-thirds majority vote in the Senate is required to remove the governor from office. Unlike other states, Florida does not have a provision in the state constitution that allows voters to petition for a recall election to remove the governor.

== Official residence and workplace ==
The official residence of the governor of Florida is the Florida Governor&#x27;s Mansion, in Tallahassee. The mansion was built in 1956, was designed to resemble Andrew Jackson&#x27;s Hermitage, and since July 20, 2006 is part of the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. It is also one of the official workplaces for the governor.

The governor&#x27;s primary official workplace is located within the Florida State Capitol in Tallahassee.

== Line of succession ==
The governor of Florida line of succession is set by Article IV, Section 3 of the Constitution of Florida and Florida Statute 14.055.
== Timeline of governors of Florida ==
The following timeline depicts the progression of the governors of Florida and their political affiliation at the time of assuming office.

<doc id="233842" wikidata="Q878632" url="?curid=233842" title="Governor of Mississippi">
<text>The governor of Mississippi is the head of government of Mississippi and the commander-in-chief of the state&#x27;s military forces. The governor has a duty to enforce state laws, and the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Mississippi Legislature, to convene the legislature at any time, and, except in cases of treason or impeachment, to grant pardons and reprieves.

== History of the office ==
Upon its creation in 1798, the Mississippi Territory was given a government which included a governor. Mississippi was given statehood in 1817. Its first constitution provided for a weak governor with limited appointive powers and limited to serving a two-year term. The term was extended to four years in the 1869 constitution. In 1918, legislation was passed enabling the governor to submit budget proposals to the legislature. In 1986, voters approved an amendment to the constitution permitting the governor to seek election to a consecutive term.
== Election ==
Any potential candidate for governor must be at least 30 years of age and have been a citizen of the United States for at least 20 years and a resident of Mississippi for at least five years preceding election. They serve for a four-year term and are limited to serving two consecutive terms in office.

== Powers and duties ==
=== Executive authority and responsibilities ===
The constitution of Mississippi vests the chief executive power of the state in the governor. The governor is empowered to request other executive officials in state government to report to them in writing on subjects relating to executive duties. They are designated the commander-in-chief of the state&#x27;s militia/National Guard contingent, except when the force is placed into federal service. The constitution further empowers the governor to issue pardons and reprieves for crimes except in cases of treason or impeachment.

=== Legislative authority and responsibilities ===

The governor is constitutionally obligated to report to the Mississippi Legislature on the affairs of state government, commonly delivered as a &quot;State of the State&quot; of address to a joint session of the body. The governor can also supply policy suggestions to the legislature, which can consider or ignore them at its discretion. By law, the governor is empowered to submit an executive budget recommendation to the legislature and is responsible for jointly adopting state revenue projections with the Joint Legislative Budget Committee. 

The governor is empowered to, at their discretion, call the legislature into special session to address an issue of the governor&#x27;s choosing. The governor signs bills passed by the legislature of which they approve into law and are empowered to veto bills of which they disapprove. They have line-item veto power over appropriations bills but can only veto general bills in full. A veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority vote of the assembly. Legislation can also take effect without the governor&#x27;s signature if they chose not to veto it within five days of its passage.

== Succession ==
The governor, like other state officials, can be impeached by the House of Representatives for committing acts of &quot;treason, bribery, or any high crime or misdemeanor&quot;. In the event the governor is impeached by the House, the Senate convenes as an impeachment court under the leadership of the chief justice of the Supreme Court. A two-thirds affirmative vote of the senators present constitutes a conviction and thus their removal from office. 

In the event the governor of Mississippi dies, is incapacitated, or leaves the state, the lieutenant governor assumes their responsibilities as acting governor. In the event the lieutenant governor is unavailable, the line of succession passes to the president pro tempore of the Senate and then the speaker of the House. In the event neither of them are available, the constitution requires that the secretary of state convene the Senate to designate a successor to the office.

== Office structure ==
The governor works out of three office spaces: a main one in the Walter Sillers State Office Building, one in the Governor&#x27;s Mansion, and a ceremonial one in the Mississippi State Capitol. The governor&#x27;s office retains staff which aid the chief executive in the pursuance of their duties, conduct research, and serve as liaisons with other state agencies.

The governor&#x27;s salary is fixed by the legislature and cannot be reduced during their term of office. The governor&#x27;s salary is $122,160 per year, but is set to increase to $160,000 annually in 2024.

== Political dynamics ==
The governor of Mississippi has weak institutional authority due to their lack of constitutionally prescribed powers, significant constraints on their powers, and the diffusion of state executive authority across other elected officials. Unlike in other states, Mississippi&#x27;s governor has little constitutional or statutory authority over the state budget process. As the state developed a competitive two-party system, governors became more important as party leaders with regards to their partisan counterparts in the legislature.

<doc id="233845" wikidata="Q2550683" url="?curid=233845" title="Governor of Oklahoma">
<text>The governor of Oklahoma is the head of government of the U.S. state of Oklahoma. Under the Oklahoma Constitution, the governor serves as the head of the Oklahoma executive branch, of the government of Oklahoma. The governor is the &quot;ex officio&quot; commander-in-chief of the Oklahoma National Guard when not called into federal use. Despite being an executive branch official, the governor also holds legislative and judicial powers. The governor&#x27;s responsibilities include making yearly &quot;State of the State&quot; addresses to the Oklahoma Legislature, submitting the annual state budget, ensuring that state laws are enforced, and that the peace is preserved. The governor&#x27;s term is four years in length.

The office was created in 1907 when Oklahoma was officially admitted to the federal Union of the United States as the 46th state, by act of the Congress of the United States and approval by the President. Prior to statehood, the chief executive office was preceded by a presidential appointed and confirmed by the United States Senate of the previous governors of the old Oklahoma Territory (1890-1907) in the western portion of the current state with similar powers. Since 1834 to 1907, in the eastern portion of modern Oklahoma state was the unorganized former Indian Territory, originally encompassed a much larger tract of unassigned public lands west of the Mississippi River to the Rocky Mountains, reserved for various Native Americans / Indian tribes and nations, removed and transported from the Southeastern United States in the 1830s during the infamous &quot;Trail of Tears&quot;. A federal judge of the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas, centered in the border town of Fort Smith, exercised judicial powers and sent individual and posses of U.S. Marshals and deputy Marshals to patrol that Territory in lieu of an appointed territorial Governor or other local law enforcement, governing structure or organized territorial government such as the several other federal territories in the Western United States (and later further away of territories of Alaska and Hawaii overseas), during the 19th and early 20th centuries, except for various Indian tribal police on the designated reservations.

The 28th and current Governor of Oklahoma is Kevin Stitt, a member of the Republican Party.

==History==
===Territorial period===

Before statehood in 1907, modern day-Oklahoma was composed of the Oklahoma Territory (in the West since 1890) and the Indian Territory in the original far wider / greater expanse of the old Louisiana Purchase of 1803, including today&#x27;s Midwestern and Western United States. Over subsequent decades through various treaties and outright land grabs, that expanse was later reduced gradually to the eastern half of the modern state from 1834 to 1907. While Indian Territory was semi-independent of the federal government and it&#x27;s military in far-off Washington, D.C. as Indian nations land, the Oklahoma Territory with its capital city at Guthrie, was an organized federal territory under the supervision of the President, with his executive departmental secretaries in his presidential cabinet, and both houses of the United States Congress (sending a territorial delegate to sit and speak (but no vote) on the floor of the lower chamber of the U.S. House of Representatives at the United States Capitol in Washington. Within the Oklahoma Territory, a traditional American democratic political system was created with Separation of powers and tripartite government existed just like the other states and federal government, including a territorial legislature, a territorial supreme court, and a territorial governor.

The incumbent president of the United States appointed territorial governors and assisting secretary to four-year terms, with &quot;the advice and consent&quot; of the United States Senate. Despite a set term, the governor served at the pleasure of the sitting American president, meaning that the president or his successor could replace him before his term was up.

The governor was the head of the territorial government. He had the power to veto legislation proposed by the territorial legislature and the power to appoint members to his cabinet of executive departments or bureaus, who in turn had to be ratified by territorial assembly lawmakers. The governor had the power to appoint justices to the territorial high court and any lower court judges. The governor was responsible to the president on addressing issues in the federal territory and served as the representative as the federal government of the United States in Washington. He was also the commander-in-chief of any organized the territorial militia.

George Washington Steele (1839-1922, served 1890-1891), served as the first governor of the Oklahoma Territory, appointed by 23rd President Benjamin Harrison (1833-1901, served 1889-1893), a Republican). He vetoed the territorial legislature&#x27;s attempts to move the state capital from Guthrie to Oklahoma City or Kingfisher. He was instrumental in the establishment of two territorial (later state) universities that would eventually become the University of Oklahoma and the Oklahoma State University (at Stillwater). After only seventeen months in office, Governor Steele resigned effective October 18, 1891. In his place, President Benjamin Harrison then appointed Abraham Jefferson Seay (1832-1915, served 1892-1893), to the governorship as the second occupant. Robert Martin (1833-1897, served 1890-1893), then serving as the secretary of Oklahoma Territory, served briefly himself as acting governor in the four months interim from October 18, 1891, until February 1892, when Governor-designate Seay arrived and took the oath of office in Guthrie.

Frank Frantz (1872-1941, served 1906-1907), as the seventh and final governor of the Oklahoma Territory. As Oklahoma transitioned from territory to new state, he was also an unsuccessful candidate himself for election as the first governor of the new 46th state in the first state gubernatorial election of 1907 to be held.

===Statehood-Present===
After the Oklahoma Constitution was written and accepted in 1907, the Oklahoma and Indian territories joined to form the U.S. state of Oklahoma. The office of the governor of Oklahoma replaced the office of territorial governor. The new office was similar, but designed with new restrictions, limits, and legislative and judicial oversight. It was crafted as a &quot;weak governor system&quot; to defend the state against abuses of power that had occurred under the territorial government.

Oklahoma&#x27;s first governor, Charles N. Haskell (1860-1933, served 1907-1911), wielded executive power effectively, but in the first 20 years after he left office in 1911, the assertive and dominant Oklahoma Legislature further reduced and limited the governor&#x27;s office of several of its traditional powers and impeached two state governors: John C. (&quot;Jack&quot;) Walton (1881-1949, served January–November 1923), and Henry S. Johnston (1867-1965, served 1927-1929). It was not until William H. (&quot;Alfalfa Bill&quot;) Murray (1869-1956, served 1931-1935), took office in 1931 that the Oklahoma governorship regained the initiative and executive leadership with expanded its powers.

In 1927, the state legislature appropriated $75,000 for the construction of a governor&#x27;s mansion and residence and $25,000 allotted for furnishings. The next year in 1928, the governor and his family moved in.

As Oklahoma grew and the state government expanded in its responsibilities and services, the office of the governor became gradually more powerful. As more agencies were introduced to perform certain tasks or address certain problems, the governor gained greater indirect influence through the power of appointment.

Initially the governor was not eligible to immediately succeed himself. It was not until 59 years later in 1966 that Oklahoma amended the state constitution to allow the governor to be reelected and serve two consecutive four-year terms (total of eight years), similar to most other American states and the President.

==Election==
The governor of Oklahoma is elected directly by the voters of Oklahoma during gubernatorial elections held in November during the final year of each four-year gubernatorial term. The candidate with the highest number of votes becomes governor following the election. The Oklahoma Constitution requires the Oklahoma Legislature to choose the governor in the case of a tie vote.

Section Three of Article VI of the Oklahoma Constitution establishes that gubernatorial candidates must be citizens of the United States, at least 31 years old, and residents of Oklahoma for at least ten years prior to their candidacy.

Under Section Four in Article VI of the Oklahoma Constitution, the governor serves a four-year term in office beginning on the second Monday in January. Section Four also states that no person may hold the office for more than two consecutive terms. On November 2, 2010, voters passed a ballot initiative to limit governors to only eight years in office in a lifetime. The initiative also set the gubernatorial term of a lieutenant governor who becomes governor upon the death of the previous governor at two years.

Former governor David Walters (1991–1995) is eligible for a second term, having only served a single term.

===Oath of office===
&quot;I, ..., do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support, obey, and defend the Constitution of the United States, and the Constitution of the State of Oklahoma, and that I will not, knowingly, receive, directly or indirectly, any money or other valuable thing, for the performance or nonperformance of any act or duty pertaining to my office, other than the compensation allowed by law; I further swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully discharge my duties as Governor of the State of Oklahoma to the best of my ability.&quot;

The governor, according to the Oklahoma Constitution, must &quot;take care that the laws be faithfully executed.&quot; The governor is vested with &quot;supreme executive power&quot; as the state&#x27;s &quot;Chief Magistrate&quot; and acts as head of the executive branch of Oklahoma. The governor has the power to issue executive orders that have the effect of law. The governor is the &quot;conservator of the peace throughout the State,&quot; making him or her the chief peace officer in the state. In the position of chief peace officer, the governor commands state and local law enforcement agencies. If law enforcement entities cannot execute the law, then the governor, acting as Commander-in-Chief of Oklahoma&#x27;s state militia, may call out the Oklahoma National Guard to &quot;execute the laws, protect the public health, suppress insurrection, and repel invasion.&quot; The governor is assisted in managing the military of Oklahoma by the Adjutant General of Oklahoma, an appointee of the governor.

The governor has the power to commission officers not otherwise commissioned by the law of Oklahoma and has the power of appointment. When any office at the state level becomes vacant for any reason, the governor, unless otherwise provided by law, has the power to appoint a person to fill such vacancy, who shall continue in office until the election or appointment of a successor. If the office of an Oklahoma member of the United States House of Representatives or United States Senate becomes vacant the governor calls a special election to fill the remainder of the term. In the case of United States senators, the governor is empowered by the U.S. Constitution to appoint someone immediately to fill the vacant Senate seat temporarily until a special election can be held.

Within the executive branch of Oklahoma government, the governor is assisted by the lieutenant governor of Oklahoma, the secretary of state of Oklahoma, the attorney general of Oklahoma, and the state treasurer of Oklahoma, among others. While the other high-level executive offices are elected directly by the people of Oklahoma, the secretary of state is appointed by the governor with the consent of the Oklahoma Senate for a four-year term. Due to the large number of state agencies, the governor is assisted in running the government through the use of the Oklahoma State Cabinet. Through the Cabinet, the governor can address the assembled heads of Oklahoma&#x27;s executive branch departments which oversee Oklahoma&#x27;s agencies. A secretary appointed by the governor heads each department and carries out his executive orders through that department.

The governor is an ex officio chair of numerous state commissions and committees, including the Oklahoma Commissioners of Land Office and the Oklahoma Ethics Commission. While there are executive and state commissions of which the governor is not a member, the governor has appointment power to those entities with the advice and consent of the Oklahoma Senate, such as with the Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma.

The governor is also responsible for preparing the proposed Oklahoma state budget presented to the Oklahoma Legislature in February for the next fiscal year beginning in July. After state legislators negotiate the terms of the budget with the governor, the Oklahoma House of Representatives drafts a general appropriations bill that must be approved by the legislature and signed by the governor.

===Legislative and judicial powers===
Like the president of the United States, the governor plays a major role in the legislative process. Every bill that is passed by both the Oklahoma Senate and Oklahoma House of Representatives, and every resolution requiring the assent of both chambers of the legislature, must, before it becomes a law, be presented to the governor. The governor may choose to sign it or veto it and send it back to the legislature. The governor&#x27;s veto can only be overridden by a two-thirds approval vote from each house.

The governor has the power of the line-item veto, which allows them to sign part of appropriation bills into law, while sending appropriations items they disagree with back to the legislature. Items disapproved by the governor in this manner become void, unless the legislation is re-passed in both the Oklahoma House of Representatives and Oklahoma Senate with a two-thirds vote in favor of overriding the veto.

Bills that are part of the governor&#x27;s agenda are often drafted at the initiative of the governor or governor&#x27;s staff. In annual and special messages to the Oklahoma Legislature, the governor may propose legislation. The most important annual message to state lawmakers takes place in the annual State of the State address. Before a joint session of the Oklahoma Legislature, the governor outlines the status of the state and legislative proposals for the upcoming year. The governor is in a strong position to influence public opinion and thereby to influence the actions of state legislators.

The governor has the power to convoke the legislature, or the Oklahoma Senate only, on extraordinary occasions. During extraordinary sessions, state legislators can only act on subjects the governor recommends for consideration. When ever a vacancy occurs within the state legislature, the governor shall issue a writ of election to fill such vacancies. In case of a disagreement between the two houses of the legislature, at a regular or special session, the governor may adjourn them to such time as he shall deem proper, not beyond the day of the next stated meeting of the legislature. The governor may convoke the Oklahoma Legislature at or adjourn it to another place, when, in his opinion, the public safety or welfare, or the safety or health of the members require it. Such a change or adjournment must be concurred by two-thirds votes in all branches of the legislature.

The governor plays an active role within the judicial branch of Oklahoma government. Oklahoma has a Judicial Nominating Commission consisting of thirteen members that review all potential justices and judges of Oklahoma&#x27;s appellate courts, such as the Oklahoma Supreme Court, and review them to determine if they qualify to hold their respective positions. Of these thirteen members, the governor appoints six without the consent of the Oklahoma Legislature. The governor&#x27;s appointments serve for a term of six years each; the terms are staggered so that approximately one-third of the appointments become vacant every two years.

In the event of a vacancy upon the Oklahoma Supreme Court or on the Court of Criminal Appeals, the Judicial Nominating Committee submits three nominees to fill the vacancy to the governor and Oklahoma Supreme Court chief justice. The governor must appoint one to fill the vacancy within 60 days or the appointment is turned over to the chief justice.

The governor also possess the power to grant commutations, pardons and paroles for all offenses, except cases of impeachment, upon such conditions and with such restrictions and limitations as he may deem proper, subject to such regulations as may be prescribed by law. The governor does not have the power to grant paroles if a convict has been sentenced to death or sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. In order to grant a pardon to an individual, he must submit the name of the individual to the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board composed of five members, three of which are appointed by the governor at the beginning of his term in office to serve a term that coincides with his own. After reviewing the applicant for clemency, and a favorable vote from the majority, the board may empower the governor to make such acts of as he deems necessary.

The governor has the power to grant after conviction, reprieves, or a leave of absence not to exceed sixty days, without the action of the board. The governor is required to communicate to the Oklahoma Legislature, at each regular session, each case of reprieve, commutation, parole or pardon, granted, stating the name of the convict, the crime of which he was convicted, the date and place of conviction, and the date of commutation, pardon, parole and reprieve.

===Foreign relations===

The governor, as Oklahoma&#x27;s head of state, serves as the chief representative of Oklahoma to the United States and to the world. Deals between Oklahoma and foreign powers (including other U.S. states and the United States) are negotiated by the governor. This reflects the governor&#x27;s position as the spokesman for the state and the state&#x27;s interests to other state and world leaders. However, the governor may not make treaties with other nations or other U.S. states, as this is prevented by the United States Constitution.

In discharging his duty as chief spokesman, the governor may be required to testify before the United States Congress or meet with the President of the United States to address national issues that may affect the state. It is the governor&#x27;s responsibility to promote Oklahoma&#x27;s industries to the world economy as the spokesman for industrial development within the state. Along with those responsibilities comes the role of chief promoter of Oklahoma&#x27;s goods and services to foreign consumers.

As Oklahoma&#x27;s head of state, the governor may travel through the country to promote Oklahoma in a general interest or travel abroad to serve as proponent of America&#x27;s interests.

===Emergency powers===
Pursuant to the Oklahoma Emergency Management Act of 2003 and the Catastrophic Health Emergency Powers Act, in case a natural or man-made emergency or a catastrophic health emergency occurs or is anticipated in the immediate future, the governor gains emergency powers to better respond to the emergency and combat the threat. Either the governor through executive order or the Oklahoma Legislature through concurrent resolution may declare a state of emergency. Once declared, the governor may exercise additional emergency powers. At any time, the governor (through executive order) or the state legislature (through concurrent resolution) may declare an end to the state of emergency and suspend the governor&#x27;s emergency powers.

Upon the declaration of an emergency, the governor is allowed a limited-form of rule by decree. He assumes direct regulatory control over essential resources of the state. It will then be the responsibility of the governor to determine the priorities of such resources and allocate them as the governor may deem necessary. These resources include, but are not limited to, food, manpower, health and health manpower, water, transportation, economic stabilization, electric power, petroleum, gas, and solid fuel, industrial production, construction and housing.

The focus of the governor&#x27;s emergency powers is to ensure the security and stability of the state. The governor receives comprehensive police powers in an emergency. In discharging those power to enforce laws, rules and regulations relating to emergency management, the governor assumes direct operational control of emergency management forces of the state, including the Oklahoma National Guard, state police agencies, state and local health departments, as well as county sheriff&#x27;s offices and local police departments. These emergency police powers extend to providing for the evacuation of the state&#x27;s population from any affected or threatened area or areas within the state, regulating the conduct of civilians and the movement of pedestrians and vehicular traffic, and regulating public meetings and gatherings. The governor is responsible for providing for the care of all those regulated by their orders.

During a state of emergency, the governor is authorized to utilize the services, equipment, supplies and facilities of all departments, offices and agencies of the state to the maximum extent practicable. State, county, and local officers and personnel must cooperate with the governor in emergency management, based upon he governor&#x27;s direction. Any state, county, or local official that willful fails to obey any order, rule or regulation issued by the governor may be removed from office by the governor. However, before removal, officers must receives the charges against them and have an opportunity to defend themselves. Pending the presentation of charges, the governor may suspend such officers for a period not to exceed thirty days. Any vacancy resulting from removal or suspension shall be filled by the governor until it is filled as provided by state law. However, according to the Oklahoma Constitution, the governor may not remove from office the elective state executive officers, the justices of the Oklahoma Supreme Court, the judges of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, and members of the Oklahoma Legislature.

When carrying out the functions of emergency powers, the governor is immune from civilly liable for any loss or injury resulting from any decision, determination, order or action in the performance of the governor&#x27;s assigned duties and responsibilities during a stated emergency. However, this immunity does not apply when such loss or injury is caused by the gross negligence, or willfully and unnecessarily act by the governor.

==Relationship with lieutenant governor==
The lieutenant governor of Oklahoma is elected at the same election as the governor, but not jointly as the running mate of the gubernatorial candidate. Oklahoma currently has a governor and a lieutenant governor of the same party, as both Governor Kevin Stitt and Lieutenant Governor Matt Pinnell are of the Republican Party.

The first instance of an Oklahoma governor serving alongside a lieutenant governor of a different political party began in 1963, when Republican governor Henry Bellmon served alongside Democratic lieutenant governor Leo Winters. Since then, there have been three more instances. In 1967, Republican governor Dewey F. Bartlett served alongside Democratic lieutenant governor George Nigh. In 1987, Bellmon served alongside Democratic lieutenant governor Robert S. Kerr III. Finally, in 2002, Democratic governor Brad Henry served alongside Republican lieutenant governor Mary Fallin.

The governor may appoint the lieutenant governor to their cabinet. For example, Governor Mary Fallin appointed Lieutenant Governor Todd Lamb to serve as her small business advocate within her Cabinet – although Lamb later resigned that position due to disagreements with the Governor.

A lieutenant governor can also serve as Acting Governor. When acting as the governor, the Oklahoma Constitution provides all the powers of the governor to the lieutenant governor. This includes the power of signing or vetoing legislation, making political appointments, calling out the Oklahoma National Guard, or granting pardons. The need for the lieutenant governor to act as the governor may be due to the governor&#x27;s absence from the state, or the inability to discharge the powers and duties of the office. When acting as governor, the lieutenant governor holds the powers of the governor until the governor returns to the state or found to be able to discharge the powers and duties of the office.

==Office of the Governor==
The Office of the Governor is the state agency that supports the governor in the performance of gubernatorial duties. The agency consists of the governor&#x27;s staff and is headed by the governor&#x27;s chief of staff. Staffers are political appointees and serve at the pleasure of the governor. They work in the governor&#x27;s Oklahoma State Capitol offices in Oklahoma City, the governor&#x27;s Tulsa office and the Governor&#x27;s Mansion.

As of 2013, the agency has an annual budget of approximately $1.98 million. The budget provides funding for employee salaries and benefits, operation and upkeep of the governor&#x27;s offices in the Oklahoma State Capitol and Tulsa, Oklahoma, and the operation and upkeep of the Governor&#x27;s Mansion.

==Residence==
Since 1928, Oklahoma governors reside in the Oklahoma Governor&#x27;s Mansion. Before its construction, governors lived in various locations around Guthrie and Oklahoma City. Governor Charles N. Haskell set up his administration&#x27;s office and his official residence within a hotel in Oklahoma City. The Oklahoma Legislature provided for the construction of an official residence after years of debate in 1927. The next year, in 1928, the mansion was completed.

Built by an Oklahoma City architectural firm, Layton, Hicks and Forsyth, the mansion is of Dutch-Colonial style. Carthage limestone was used so the exterior of the Mansion would complement the Oklahoma State Capitol, which is located to the west of the mansion. The state legislature allocated $100,000 of state money ($75,000 for construction and $25,000 for furnishing) to the project. Two years later, another $39,000 was set aside to complete outbuildings and landscaping. Though originally having 19 rooms, today the Mansion has 12, including a library, parlor, dining room, grand ballroom, kitchen, sunroom and five bedrooms.

The mansion also serves as an active museum. Throughout the mansion there are antiques and artwork from both museum and private collections. The museum is designed to provide a glimpse into Oklahoma&#x27;s history and culture. Artists represented in oil and bronze include N.C. Wyeth, Charles Marion Russell, Thomas Moran and Albert Beirstadt.

==Succession==
As per the Oklahoma Constitution, if the governor is impeached, resigns, dies, leaves the state, fails to qualify or is unable to serve, the lieutenant governor fills the vacancy, either temporarily or for the remainder of the gubernatorial term.

If, during a vacancy of the office of governor, the lieutenant governor is impeached, displaced, resigns, dies, is absent from the state, or becomes incapable of performing the duties of the office, the president pro tempore of the state senate is the next official in the gubernatorial line of succession. The Speaker of the Oklahoma House of Representatives is third in line of gubernatorial succession.

If the governor, lieutenant governor, senate president pro tempore, and speaker are unable to act as governor, then the next official in the line of succession becomes the emergency interim successor. As the emergency interim successor to the governor, the officer may exercise the powers and discharge the duties of the governor until a new governor is elected or until the disability is removed from the governor or higher official. However, the emergency interim successor does not inherit the title of governor, unless there is a man-made or natural emergency or disaster has occurred in the United States. The Oklahoma Legislature, by concurrent resolution, may terminate the authority of any emergency interim successor to exercise the powers and discharge the duties of the governor.

===Line of succession===

As provided by the Oklahoma Constitution and the Oklahoma Emergency Interim Executive and Judicial Succession Act, the line of succession to the governorship is as follows:

<doc id="233847" wikidata="Q5589724" url="?curid=233847" title="Governor of Tennessee">
<text>The governor of Tennessee is the head of government of the U.S. state of Tennessee and the commander-in-chief of the state&#x27;s military forces. The governor is the only official in the Tennessee state government who is directly elected by the voters of the entire state.

The current governor is Bill Lee, a member of the Republican Party, who took office on January 19, 2019, as the state&#x27;s 50th governor. He was re-elected to serve a second term in 2022.

== Qualifications ==
The Tennessee Constitution provides that the governor must be at least 30 years old and must have lived in the state for at least seven years before being elected to the office. The governor is elected to a four-year term and may serve no more than two terms consecutively. There are only two other U.S. states, New Jersey and Hawaii, where the governor is the only state official to be elected statewide.

==Powers and duties==
The Tennessee Constitution provides that &quot;The supreme executive power of this state shall be vested in a governor.&quot; Most state department heads and some members of boards and commissions are appointed by the governor.

The governor is the commander-in-chief of the state&#x27;s National Guard and the state militia, except when they have been called into federal service. The governor chairs the Tennessee Board of Regents, the University of Tennessee&#x27;s Board of Trustees, and holds seats on the State Funding Board, State Building Commission, Board of Equalization, Tennessee Local Development Authority, School Bond Authority, and Tennessee Industrial and Agricultural Development Commission.

The Constitution grants the governor the power to veto laws passed by the Tennessee General Assembly, as well as line-item veto authority for individual spending items included in bills passed by the legislature. In either situation, the governor&#x27;s veto can be overridden by a simple majority of both houses of the legislature. If a governor exercises the veto authority after the legislature has adjourned, the veto stands. It is uncommon for Tennessee governors to use their veto power, likely because it is relatively easy for the General Assembly to override a veto.

Article III Section 9 of the state constitution empowers the governor to call the General Assembly into special session, with the subjects to be considered limited to matters specified in the proclamation.

=== Nominations of justices ===

In the state of Tennessee, one of the powers of the governor is to appoint justices to the state, local, and appellate courts through a system known as the Tennessee Plan. The process includes nominees being vetted by a judicial nomination commission before being appointed. After their initial term, judges are required to run in a retention election to determine if they will serve another term in the courts.

=== Cabinet appointments ===
The Tennessee Governor&#x27;s Cabinet is made up of seven key staff members and 23 Executive Departments. Key staff members include Chief Operating Manager, Chief of Staff, Special Assistant, Senior Adviser, Communications Director, Policy Director, and Deputy to the Governor. The Executive Department cabinet includes Commissioners of Agriculture, Commerce, Correction, Developmental Disability, Education, Environment, General Services, Health, Finance, Labor, among others. Most executive department positions are chosen by the governor, but some like secretary of state, attorney general, treasurer, and lieutenant governor are chosen by popular statewide elections with limited input from the governor. State comptrollers and department heads are typically chosen by panels or commissions independent of gubernatorial interference, the most common chosen in this way across the United States being the head of Education, Natural Resources, Labor, and high Education boards.

Before being inaugurated as governor, then Governor-elect Bill Lee announced two appointments: Maj. Gen. Jeff Holmes for the Department of Military and Ret. Lt. Col. Courtney Rogers for the Department of Veterans Services. In early January, Governor Bill Lee announced three new cabinet appointments: Dr. Lisa Piercey to the Department of Health, Brad Turner to the Department of Developmental Disability, and Christi Branscom to the Department of General Services. Along with announcing new cabinet members, Bill Lee also announced a new website where Tennesseans can apply to work in the administration and check on policy issues called Bill Lee Transition

=== State of the State address ===
Article III Section 11 of the Tennessee Constitution provides that the governor shall, &quot;from time to time, give to the General Assembly information of the state of the government, and recommend for their consideration such measures as he shall judge expedient.&quot;

The State of the State address is typically delivered in January at the beginning of the General Assembly&#x27;s session and is used to outline priorities and a legislative agenda for the coming legislative session, especially for a new administration.

For example, in his first State of the State speech in 2019 Bill Lee announced his plan to add more funds to the state&#x27;s rainy day fund:&quot;As our state continues to grow, we are committed to remaining among the most fiscally sound and best managed states in America. We live in prosperous days, but it&#x27;s precisely during these times when we must build up our storehouses for when times may not be as good. For that reason, I am particularly proud of this: in my budget, we are making the largest single contribution to our Rainy Day Fund in the state&#x27;s history. When this budget is implemented, our Rainy Day Fund will be $1.1 billion – the largest it has ever been in both real dollars and as a percentage of our overall revenue.&quot;During a governor&#x27;s final address before leaving office, the speech is used to highlight the outgoing governor&#x27;s achievements. Haslam in 2018 highlighted Tennessee&#x27;s job growth rate, greater funding for K-12 education and teachers&#x27; salaries, tax and spending cuts, and a record high for high school graduation rates in Tennessee history, all achieved under his administration.

==Compensation ==
, the governor&#x27;s salary was set at $204,336 per year. This is the fourth highest U.S. gubernatorial salary. Bill Haslam and his predecessor, Phil Bredesen, both were independently wealthy before taking office and refused to accept state salaries for their service as governor.

==Line of succession==
Tennessee does not elect a lieutenant governor. If a vacancy occurs in the office of governor due to the governor&#x27;s death, removal, or resignation from office, the Tennessee Constitution provides for the Speaker of the Tennessee Senate to become governor. For this reason, the speaker is often referred to by the title &quot;lieutenant governor&quot;, and was also granted this title by statute in 1951. Following the lieutenant governor/senate speaker in the line of succession are the speaker of the Tennessee House of Representatives, the secretary of state, and the comptroller.

In the event the governor&#x27;s office becomes vacant during the first 18 months of his term, a special election for the balance of the term must be held at the time of the next federal general election. If the vacancy occurs after the first 18 months, whoever ascends to the governorship serves out the balance of the term. In either case, a partial term counts toward the limit of two consecutive terms.

Governor William Blount served from 1790 to 1796, when Tennessee was known as the Southwest Territory. He was replaced by John Sevier, the state&#x27;s first governor. Other notable governors include Willie Blount (William&#x27;s half-brother), Sam Houston (better known for his role as the President of the Republic of Texas), and future U.S. Presidents James K. Polk and Andrew Johnson

== Incumbent governor ==
Bill Lee, Republican, is the 50th governor of Tennessee, succeeding Bill Haslam in 2019. A former president of his company, the Lee Company, his primary focus so far has been job creation and the economy. In his budget proposal, Lee outlined plans for K-12 education, mental health, criminal justice, rural economic development and health care. Like Haslam, Lee also intends to add to the Rainy Day fund.

Lee&#x27;s early executive orders included an order requiring all state executive departments to report rural impact and recommendations for improvement and three regarding ethics and transparency.

== History ==

=== Experience ===
Many recent governors have been businessmen. Phil Bredesen created the HealthCare America Corporation and Bill Haslam has held multiple chair and executive positions and is a co-owner of a minor league baseball team. Current governor Bill Lee was the president of his own company before taking office.

Education varies, but typically recent governors hold at least a bachelor&#x27;s degree. Bredesen earned a degree in physics from Harvard, Haslam a bachelor&#x27;s in history from Emory University, and Lee a bachelor&#x27;s in mechanical engineering from Auburn University.

Though political experience is helpful for running for governor, it has never been a requirement. Bill Lee, for example, prior to his governorship never held office. Bredesen and Haslam were both mayors: Bredesen as mayor of Nashville from 1991 to 1999 and Haslam as mayor of Knoxville from 2003 to 2010. Early Tennessean politicians such as Andrew Jackson sometimes had a history of military service, with Jackson serving in the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812.

=== Famous governors ===

==== John Sevier ====
John Sevier was the first governor of Tennessee. He effectively founded the state and because it was new territory, he dealt with many issues that come along with founding a state. Though much of his work regards to his time in the frontier, his effects on Tennessean politics are still felt today. Biographer Carl S. Driver opined in 1932 that &quot;Most of the evidence appears to lend weight to the fact that political sectionalism in Tennessee began with the break between Jackson and Sevier.&quot; Like his rival Andrew Jackson at the time, Sevier was a member of the Democratic-Republican Party.
====Sam Houston====
Sam Houston represented Tennessee&#x27;s 7th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives from March 4, 1823, to March 3, 1827, before being elected the 6th Governor of Tennessee, serving from October 1, 1827, to April 16, 1829. Following his Tennessee governorship, he moved west, first to the Arkansas Territory and then to what was at that time Mexican Texas. Following the Battle of Gonzales—which marked the beginning of the Texas Revolution in earnest—Houston took overall command of the Texian Army and led it to victory against Mexico. Houston was then elected as the first, and then the third, President of Texas. Houston assisted in the annexation of Texas by the United States, after which he represented Texas in the US Senate. He was later elected as 7th Governor of Texas, thus becoming the only person in history to serve as governor of two different US states. The city of Houston is named after him.
==== James K. Polk ====
James K. Polk, 11th President of the United States, was the governor of Tennessee from 1839 to 1841. He was a Democrat and a devout follower of Jacksonian democratic values. Dr. John Seigenthaler wrote in his biography of Polk that &quot;To Polk, all politics was fiscal, deeply rooted in the early struggle between federalism and republicanism; Hamilton and Jefferson; the wealthy elite and the common man.&quot;
==== Andrew Johnson ====
Andrew Johnson was the 17th President of the United States following Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s assassination. A Democrat, he had joined Lincoln and the Republicans to form a National Union ticket in order to ensure the support of War Democrats in the 1864 United States presidential election. Johnson had previously been governor of Tennessee from 1853 to 1857. The Tennessean governor was not entitled to many powers at the time, but used the position to publicize his views.
==== Ray Blanton ====
Ray Blanton was governor from 1975 to 1979. He was forced from office days early by a &quot;coup&quot; led by his own party&#x27;s leaders Speaker Ned McWherter and Lieutenant Governor John S. Wilder to inaugurate Lamar Alexander early and forestall additional potential pardons of a questionable nature.
==== Phil Bredesen ====
Phil Bredesen, Democrat, was governor from 2003 to 2011. In 2018, he ran for the US Senate against now senator Marsha Blackburn. He is also a former mayor of Nashville. Bredesen also proposed Cover Tennessee, a health care plan that would cost roughly $50 per person and would follow a person even if they changed employers. Cover Tennessee also includes Cover Kids which provides services to low-income pregnant women and children. These services include vaccinations, preventative care, vision, dental, mental health, physician services, physical and speech therapy, and hospitalization. He increased the Rainy Day fund, passed four balanced budgets, and expanded pre-K programs.
==== Bill Haslam ====
Bill Haslam, Republican, was governor from 2011 to 2018, succeeding Phil Bredesen. Because he took office during the Great Recession, he focused on economic recovery. He tightened the state&#x27;s budgets, called for additional funds for Tennessee&#x27;s Rainy day fund, and worked on making Tennessee more business-friendly. However, his main legacy is in education. He is most well known for the TN Promise and Reconnect Programs, which allow students to attend a community college for two years with free tuition. This was done to make Tennessee more attractive to businesses and improve the workforce. Additionally, from 2017 to 2018, Haslam served as the chair of the Republican Governors&#x27; Association, working to elect Republicans in the 2018 gubernatorial elections.
== Recent priorities ==
In recent years there has been a heavy focus on the economy, health care, and education. Governors such as Haslam focused on making the state business friendly as much as possible, using fiscally conservative ideas when making policy. Conservatism has not been limited to Republicans however, as Phil Bredesen, a Democrat, supported the death penalty. There have been successful achievements that are not traditionally seen as conservative, namely TN Promise and Reconnect.

Bredesen&#x27;s focuses included healthcare. He announced Cover Tennessee in 2006 as &quot;a partnership between the state and small business to help adults buy affordable insurance that follows them, no matter where they work, and that doesn&#x27;t require high deductibles on the front end.&quot; Cover Tennessee would follow a citizen regardless if they changed employers and Cover Kids provides services to pregnant women and children in low-income families. His handling of TennCare, namely that he cut more than 170,000 people from the rolls for the sake of the budget, was criticized, and it played a role in his Senate race in 2018.

Tennessee governors have a history of going back and forth between democrats and republicans, though the former Democratic stronghold is now solidly Republican.

== Achievements ==
Tennessee governors&#x27; achievements generally have varied with the priorities of the administration. Since governor Haslam, much emphasis has been placed on education and increasing the number of students enrolling in technical and community colleges. Bill Lee has continued this priority by proposing a budget to increase funding for school safety and resource officers. Democratic and Republican administrations alike have carried the belief that a well balanced budget should always be paramount when shaping policy in Tennessee.

Governor Sundquist served from 1995 to 2003. In 1996 Sundquist focused heavily on ethics and welfare reforms and played a role in the creation of the Tennessee Regulatory Authority and the Families First Act. Replacing the previous Public Service Commission, the Families First Act dropped the number of welfare recipients from 70,000 to 30,000 in an effort to reduce state expenditures. Sundquist also created the Department of Children&#x27;s Services in 1996. In his second term Sundquist created the ConnectTn program which made Tennessee the first state in the country to provide internet use in public libraries and schools. Sundquist is most known for his push for a state income tax, which received wide backlash from Democrats and Republicans. His effort of tax reform was destroyed by future governor Phil Bredesen.

Phil Bredesen campaigned to reduce waste in state government, reform TennCare, and improve Tennessee schools. In 2004, Bredesen enacted TennCare reform, cutting the budget by more than half and removing nearly 200,000 citizens from being eligible for Medicaid. Bredesen increased funding for education by $366.5 million focusing on Pre-K incentives and increasing teacher pay. In 2006 Bredesen created Cover Tennessee protecting Tennesseans with preexisting conditions and expanding care to uninsured children. In 2007, Bredesen pushed for another increase to education funding by issuing a cigarette tax, the increase would amount to $343 million for education.

The Haslam administration focused heavily on improving the economy and education in Tennessee. In 2012 Haslam signed a budget to increase construction spending by $560 million and eliminate the inheritance and gift tax. The bill also included a plan called &quot;Fast Track&quot;, which aimed to provide incentives for companies to move to Tennessee. Haslam&#x27;s most well-known accomplishment is the Tennessee Promise and Reconnect programs. Tennessee Promise gives Tennesseans the opportunity of two free years of community college or technical school. The Reconnect program provides incentives for adults to return for post-secondary degrees. In 2012, Haslam introduced the T.E.A.M. Act in an attempt to improve state employee performance. The bill would change hiring and advancements policy to prioritize job performance over seniority. In 2017, Haslam introduced the IMPROVE Act which aimed to provide funding for $10 billion of needed road construction. The act cut food sales taxes, but raised taxes on gas, diesel, and natural gas. The bill also created an annual $100 fee for electric car owners and increased all vehicle registration fees.

<doc id="233852" wikidata="Q357952" url="?curid=233852" title="Willie Blount">
<text>Willie Blount (April 18, 1768September 10, 1835) was an American politician who served as the third Governor of Tennessee from 1809 to 1815. Blount&#x27;s efforts to raise funds and soldiers during the War of 1812 earned Tennessee the nickname, &quot;Volunteer State.&quot; He was the younger half-brother of Southwest Territory governor, William Blount. He was a member of the Democratic-Republican Party.

==Early life==
Willie (pronounced &quot;Wiley&quot;) was born at Blount Hall in Bertie County in the Province of North Carolina, to Jacob Blount and his second wife, Hannah Salter Blount. He studied at the College of New Jersey (modern Princeton) and King&#x27;s College (modern Columbia). He read law with Judge John Sitgreaves in New Bern, North Carolina, in the 1780s, and was admitted to the North Carolina bar.

In 1790, Willie&#x27;s brother, William, was appointed governor of the newly created Southwest Territory, and Willie accompanied him to the new territory to serve as his private secretary. When Tennessee was admitted as a state in 1796, the state legislature appointed Willie Blount to the Superior Court of Law and Equity (the state&#x27;s highest court at the time), though he either declined the appointment or resigned before issuing any opinions.

Following William Blount&#x27;s death in 1800, Willie Blount took charge of the family finances, and quickly discovered that his brother&#x27;s risky land investments had left the family deeply in debt. In 1802, he moved to Montgomery County, Tennessee, where he established a large plantation, and gradually began restoring the family&#x27;s financial affairs. He represented Montgomery County in the Tennessee House of Representatives from 1807 to 1809.

==Governor==
In 1809, Blount ran for governor against former U.S. senator and frontiersman, William Cocke (the incumbent, John Sevier, was term-limited). Population shifts had begun to favor Middle and West Tennessee over Cocke&#x27;s home of East Tennessee, and Blount won the election, 13,686 votes to 8,435. He was reelected without opposition in 1811 and 1813.

Like his predecessors, Sevier and Archibald Roane, much of Blount&#x27;s governorship was spent dealing with conflicts between Indians and white settlers. He persistently sought to acquire land from the Cherokee and Chickasaw, and attempted to suppress the activities of hostile Choctaws and Creeks. Early in his term, he suggested in a letter to Secretary of War William Eustis that the Cherokee be relocated to lands west of the Mississippi River, an act carried out two decades later by President Andrew Jackson. He also blamed northern tribes for encouraging the Creeks to harass white settlers, and at one point requested Eustis send troops to sever communications between northern and southern tribes.

During Blount&#x27;s tenure, Tennessee was divided into five judicial districts. He signed anti-counterfeiting measures, and enacted legislation to settle conflicting land claims from Tennessee&#x27;s pre-statehood period. Blount also sought navigational improvements, overseeing the completion of the Cumberland Turnpike (connecting Nashville and Knoxville), and calling for a navigable waterway from Tennessee to Mobile, Alabama.

During his second and third terms, Blount was occupied with the War of 1812. During the first few months of the war, he struggled with a lack of communication with the War Department as he awaited permission to order the militia (led by an increasingly impatient Andrew Jackson) south to New Orleans. Following the Fort Mims massacre in 1813, a call to arms issued by Blount was met by 3,500 volunteers. These were divided into two divisions led by Jackson and John Cocke, and ordered south to suppress the hostile Creek tribes. Blount managed to raise over $300,000 for the expedition, an astonishing sum of money for the time. The surprising number of volunteers earned Tennessee the nickname, &quot;Volunteer State.&quot;

At the end of the War of 1812, Blount was at the height of his popularity. Historian J. G. M. Ramsey wrote, &quot;Willie&#x27;s popularity with the masses has rarely been equalled.&quot; In 1815, constitutional term limits prevented him from seeking a fourth consecutive term.

==Later life==

In 1827, Blount ran for governor against Congressman Sam Houston and ex-Congressman Newton Cannon (the incumbent, William Carroll, was term-limited), but placed a distant third, winning just 1,784 votes to 44,243 for Houston and 32,929 for Cannon. In 1834, Blount represented Montgomery County at the state constitutional convention, which drafted a new document to replace the one in effect since the state had been admitted in 1796, and which has many similarities to the 1870 constitution which is still in effect. One of the chief differences between the 1834 constitution and its predecessor was considerably greater powers being granted to the executive branch than in the earlier document.

Blount died in Nashville on September 10, 1835, and is interred at Greenwood Cemetery in Clarksville. In 1878, the state placed a large monument on his grave.

==Family and legacy==

Blount married Lucinda Baker in 1802. They had two daughters, Eliza Ann Blount and Lucinda Blount.

Blount was the younger half-brother of William Blount, a signer of the United States Constitution and governor of the Southwest Territory. Another half-brother, Thomas Blount, was a congressman from North Carolina, and a nephew, William Grainger Blount, represented Tennessee&#x27;s 2nd district in Congress from 1815 to 1819. Willie Blount was the great-great grandfather of Harry Hill McAlister, who served as Governor of Tennessee in the 1930s.

In 1803, Blount published a school textbook, &quot;A Catechetical Exposition of the Constitution of the State of Tennessee&quot;, which was printed by early Knoxville newspaper editor George Roulstone. Blount later made plans to write a comprehensive history of the state, but this work was never completed.

Blount County, Alabama, is named in Willie Blount&#x27;s honor for his assistance during the Creek War.

<text>Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk (144321 May 1524), styled Earl of Surrey from 1483 to 1485 and again from 1489 to 1514, was an English nobleman, soldier and statesman who served four monarchs. He was the eldest son of John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk, by his first wife, Catharina de Moleyns. The Duke was the grandfather of both Queen Anne Boleyn and Queen Katherine Howard and the great-grandfather of Queen Elizabeth I. In 1513, he led the English to victory over the Scots at the decisive Battle of Flodden, for which he was richly rewarded by King Henry VIII, then away in France.

==Early life==
Thomas Howard was born in 1443 at Stoke-by-Nayland, Suffolk, the only surviving son of John Howard, later 1st Duke of Norfolk, by his first wife, Katherine, the daughter of Sir William Moleyns (died 8 June 1425) and his wife Margery. He was educated at Thetford Grammar School.

==Service under Edward IV==
While a young man, he entered the service of King Edward IV as a henchman. Howard took the King&#x27;s side when war broke out in 1469 with the Earl of Warwick, and took sanctuary at Colchester when the King fled to Holland in 1470. Howard rejoined the royal forces at Edward&#x27;s return to England in 1471, and was severely wounded at the Battle of Barnet on 14 April 1471. He was appointed an esquire of the body in 1473. On 14 January 1478 he was knighted by Edward IV at the marriage of the King&#x27;s second son, the young Duke of York, and Lady Anne Mowbray (died 1481).

==Service under Richard III==

After the death of Edward IV on 9 April 1483, Thomas Howard and his father John supported Richard III. Thomas bore the Sword of State at Richard&#x27;s coronation and served as steward at the coronation banquet. Both Thomas and his father were granted lands by the new King, and Thomas was also granted an annuity of £1000. On 28 June 1483, John Howard was created Duke of Norfolk, while Thomas was created Earl of Surrey. Surrey was also sworn of the Privy Council and invested with the Order of the Garter. In the autumn of that year Norfolk and Surrey suppressed a rebellion against the King by the Duke of Buckingham. Both Howards remained close to King Richard throughout his two-year reign, and fought for him at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, where Surrey was wounded and taken prisoner, and his father killed. Surrey was attainted in the first Parliament of the new King, Henry VII, stripped of his lands, and committed to the Tower of London, where he spent the next three years.

==Service under Henry VII==
Howard was offered an opportunity to escape during the rebellion of the Earl of Lincoln in 1487, but refused, perhaps thereby convincing Henry VII of his loyalty. In May 1489 Henry restored him to the earldom of Surrey, although most of his lands were withheld, and sent him to quell a rebellion in Yorkshire. Surrey remained in the north as the King&#x27;s lieutenant until 1499. He and his family lived in Sheriff Hutton Castle while in the North. 
In 1496/7 he was given a command against invading Scots and took his sons Thomas and Edward with him. Surrey knighted both of them on 30 September 1497 at Ayton Castle-the very same day the treaty of Ayton was signed. 

In 1499 he was recalled to court, and accompanied the King on a state visit to France in the following year. In 1501 he was again appointed a member of the Privy Council, and on 16 June of that year was made Lord High Treasurer. Surrey, Richard Foxe (Bishop of Winchester and Lord Privy Seal) and William Warham (Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord Chancellor), became the King&#x27;s &quot;executive triumvirate&quot;. He was entrusted with a number of diplomatic missions. In 1501 he was involved in the negotiations for Katherine of Aragon&#x27;s marriage to Arthur, Prince of Wales, and in 1503 conducted Margaret Tudor to Scotland for her marriage to King James IV. Margaret found Howard rude and overbearing on the journey and resented his monopolisation of her new husband after the wedding.

==Service under Henry VIII==

Surrey was an executor of the will of King Henry VII when the King died on 21 April 1509, and played a prominent role in the coronation of King Henry VIII, in which he served as Earl Marshal. He challenged Thomas Wolsey in an effort to become the new King&#x27;s first minister, but eventually accepted Wolsey&#x27;s supremacy. Surrey expected to lead the 1513 expedition to France, but was left behind when the King departed for Calais on 30 June 1513. Shortly thereafter King James IV of Scotland launched an invasion into England, and Surrey, with the aid of other noblemen and his sons Thomas and Edmund, crushed James&#x27;s much larger force at the Battle of Flodden, near Branxton, Northumberland, on 9 September 1513. The Scots may have lost as many as 10,000 men, and King James was killed. The victory at Flodden brought Surrey great popular renown and royal rewards. On 1 February 1514, at the age of 71, he was created 2nd Duke of Norfolk, his late father&#x27;s title, and his son Thomas was made Earl of Surrey. Both were granted lands and annuities, and the Howard arms were augmented in honour of Flodden with an inescutcheon bearing the lion of Scotland pierced through the mouth with an arrow.

==Final years==
In the final decade of his life, Norfolk continued his career as a courtier, diplomat and soldier. In 1514 he joined Wolsey and Foxe in negotiating the marriage of Mary Tudor to King Louis XII of France, and escorted her to France for the wedding. On 1 May 1517, he led a private army of 1,300 retainers into London to suppress the Evil May Day riots. In May 1521 he presided as Lord High Steward over the trial of Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham, father of Norfolk&#x27;s daughter-in-law, Elizabeth. According to David M. Head, &quot;he pronounced the sentence of death with tears streaming down his face&quot;.

By the spring of 1522, Norfolk was almost 80 years of age and in failing health. He withdrew from court, resigned as Lord Treasurer in favour of his son in December of that year, and after attending the opening of Parliament in April 1523, retired to his ducal castle at Framlingham in Suffolk where he died on 21 May 1524. His funeral and burial on 22 June at Thetford Priory were said to have been &quot;spectacular and enormously expensive, costing over £1300 and including a procession of 400 hooded men bearing torches and an elaborate bier surmounted with 100 wax effigies and 700 candles&quot;, befitting the richest and most powerful peer in England. After the dissolution of Thetford Priory, the Howard tombs were moved to the Church of St Michael the Archangel, Framlingham. A now-lost monumental brass depicting the 2nd Duke was formerly in the Church of St. Mary at Lambeth.

==Marriages and issue==

On 30 April 1472, Howard married Elizabeth Tilney, the daughter of Sir Frederick Tilney of Ashwellthorpe, Norfolk, and widow of Sir Humphrey Bourchier, slain at Barnet, son and heir apparent of Sir John Bourchier, 1st Baron Berners. They had issue:

* Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk
* Sir Edward Howard
* Lord Edmund Howard, father of Henry VIII&#x27;s fifth Queen, Katherine Howard
* Sir John Howard 1482-1530
* Henry Howard
* Charles Howard
* Henry Howard (the younger)
* Richard Howard
* Elizabeth Howard, married Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire, and was mother of Queen Anne Boleyn, and grandmother of Queen Elizabeth.
* Muriel Howard (died 1512), married firstly John Grey, 2nd Viscount Lisle (died 1504), and secondly Sir Thomas Knyvet

Norfolk&#x27;s first wife died on 4 April 1497, and on 8 November 1497 he married, by dispensation dated 17 August 1497, her cousin, Agnes Tilney, the daughter of Hugh Tilney of Skirbeck and Boston, Lincolnshire and Eleanor, a daughter of Walter Tailboys. They had issue:
* William Howard, 1st Baron Howard of Effingham
* Lord Thomas Howard (1511–1537)
* Richard Howard (died 1517)
* Dorothy Howard, married Edward Stanley, 3rd Earl of Derby
* Anne Howard, married John de Vere, 14th Earl of Oxford
* Katherine Howard, married firstly, Rhys ap Gruffydd. Married secondly, Henry Daubeney, 1st Earl of Bridgewater.
* Elizabeth Howard (died 1536), married Henry Radclyffe, 2nd Earl of Sussex.
Note: Thomas Howard indeed had two living daughters named Elizabeth Howard and two living sons named Thomas Howard. It is unclear if he had two sons named Richard as well or if it was the same person. In the Dukes of Norfolk family tree, there is clearly a mistake. Richard Howard is there linked to Agnes Tilney (2nd wife of Thomas Howard), yet is said to born in 1487, which is impossible to be true, as at the time Thomas Howard was married to Elizabeth Tilney.

<text>USS &quot;Dubuque&quot; (LPD-8) was an of the United States Navy.

USS &quot;Dubuque&quot; was the second ship named after Dubuque, Iowa on the Mississippi River and her founder, Julien Dubuque - a French Canadian explorer. USS &quot;Dubuque&quot; was commissioned on 1 September 1967 at Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth, Virginia.

==History==
&quot;Dubuque&quot;″s keel was laid down on 25 January 1965 by Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi. She was launched on 6 August 1966 and commissioned on 1 September 1967 at Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth, Virginia. In November 1967, the ship arrived at her first homeport of San Diego, California after transiting the Panama Canal.

From 1968 until 1975, She made five Western Pacific deployments that saw extensive duty in Vietnam. In a highly publicized event in October 1968, the ship returned 14 repatriated prisoners of war (POWs) to North Vietnam. From 1969 until 1971 the ship conducted ten Operation Keystone Cardinal troop lifts to Okinawa as part of the withdrawal of US forces. &quot;Dubuque&quot; relieved as the launch platform for HMA-369&#x27;s Marine Hunter-Killer (MARHUK) Operations near Hon La (Tiger Island) off the coast of North Vietnam. From February to June 1973 the ship operated helicopters that conducted naval mine clearance operations in Haiphong Harbor as part of Operation End Sweep. In April 1975 the ship participated in Operation Frequent Wind, the evacuation of Saigon and the rescue of refugees fleeing South Vietnam.

On 15 August 1985 &quot;Dubuque&quot; departed San Diego for her new homeport of Sasebo, Japan, where she arrived 4 September 1985. There, she joined the Seventh Fleet Overseas Family Residency Program, her primary mission to support the Marine Corps in the Western Pacific.

On 10 June 1988, they sighted a 35-foot wooden boat packed with Vietnamese refugees fleeing communist rule in their homeland. The boat sailed from Ben Tre, Vietnam (22 May), but the engine failed two days later and she drifted. &quot;Dubuque&quot;’s sailors fatally underestimated the numbers of people on board who struggled for survival against starvation and exposure on board their flimsy craft (they estimated 50–70 refugees but 110 people had purportedly put to sea). &quot;Dubuque&quot;’s commanding officer, accessed the situation and decided to distribute food and water to the castaways, as well as charts providing limited navigational information. The Navy later released a statement that “the craft was judged to be in seaworthy condition and was under sail.” &quot;Dubuque&quot; continued on her original voyage.

The food and water proved inadequate for the actual number of people on board the boat, however; and as many as 58 died, an estimated 20 succumbed before they sighted &quot;Dubuque&quot;, and the remaining victims following the U.S. ship’s departure from the area. Grim tales afterward emerged of desperate people who resorted to cannibalism to survive. Filipino fishermen eventually rescued the 52 survivors. The Navy relieved the Commanding Officer of his command (11 August), and subsequently court martialed him (at his request). The court found him guilty of violating standing orders to render assistance to those in peril of the sea, and he received a letter of reprimand.

In May 1988, she deployed to the Persian Gulf and served as the control ship for mine sweeping operations to protect US-flagged tankers during the Iran–Iraq War. For her participation in this operation, the ship was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation. In 1989 the ship participated in the contingency operation to evacuate American personnel from the Philippines during a failed coup attempt.

===1990s===
Immediately following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, &quot;Dubuque&quot; was deployed to the Persian Gulf as part of Operation Desert Shield. The ship functioned as the leading element of Amphibious Ready Group Bravo, which transported Marine Regimental Landing Team Four to Al Jubayl, Saudi Arabia during the critical early stages of the multi-national buildup.

In November 1998 &quot;Dubuque&quot; again deployed to the Persian Gulf as part of the Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) on support of Operation Desert Fox.

On 30 July 1999, &quot;Dubuque&quot; was relieved by as part of the forward-deployed naval forces. Since then, she has been once again home-ported in San Diego, California.

From June to September 1999, &quot;Dubuque&quot; participated in the first SHIP-SWAP with her sister ship &quot;Juneau&quot;, where each ship&#x27;s crew remained in their original home ports, allowing &quot;Dubuque&quot; to return to the homeport of San Diego.

===2000s===
From January to July 2003 &quot;Dubuque&quot; was deployed with and , transporting the 15th MEU to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom where among other missions the ship served as a holding facility for Iraqi POWs. &quot;Dubuque&quot; also assisted in the protection and maintenance of oil platforms in the northern part of the Persian Gulf. &quot;Dubuque&quot; served as the air platform that launched the Jessica Lynch rescue mission.

&quot;Dubuque&quot; deployed again in 2008 with the Expeditionary Strike Group. Her crew participated in the pursuit of identifying pirates and collecting intelligence on piracy off the Gulf of Oman and the Horn of Africa. She also participated in rescuing six mariners from a sinking vessel off the Philippine coastline on the way to the Persian Gulf.

In early May 2009 &quot;Dubuque&quot; had to abort a humanitarian aid mission to the South Pacific after a sailor on board developed Influenza A virus subtype H1N1 during the worldwide 2009 swine flu pandemic. It was later found out that approximately 50 cases were likely also H1N1 (swine flu). As a result, the ship&#x27;s June 2009 deployment to Oceania in support of the Pacific Partnership program was canceled.

On 9 September 2010, Marines attached to the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit&#x27;s Maritime Raid Force launched from &quot;Dubuque&quot; and boarded and seized control of the German-flagged off the coast of Somalia. The pirates had taken control of the ship the previous day. The Marines captured nine pirates and rescued eleven crew members who had taken refuge in a &quot;safe room&quot; on the ship. No shots were fired and no injuries were reported.

== Fate ==
USS &quot;Dubuque&quot; was officially decommissioned on 30 June 2011. &quot;Dubuque&quot; was sunk as a target on 11 July 2024 during the RIMPAC 2024 exercise A number of weapons were used during the test, including a Quicksink bomb dropped from a B-2 Spirit stealth bomber.

==Awards==

According to the Navy Awards website, &quot;Dubuque&quot; has received one Navy Unit Commendation, four Meritorious Unit Commendations, three Battle Efficiency Awards, three Armed Forces Expeditionary Medals, three Humanitarian Service Medals and participated in countless amphibious exercises and operations throughout the Western Pacific and Indian Oceans.

<doc id="233857" wikidata="Q503816" url="?curid=233857" title="Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk">
<text>Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, (10 March 1473 – 25 August 1554) was an English politician and nobleman of the Tudor era. He was an uncle of two of the wives of King Henry VIII, Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard, both of whom were beheaded, and played a major role in the machinations affecting these royal marriages. After falling from favour in 1546, Norfolk was stripped of his dukedom and imprisoned in the Tower of London, avoiding execution when Henry VIII died on 28 January 1547.

He was released on the accession of the Roman Catholic Queen Mary I, whom he aided in securing the throne, thus setting the stage for tensions between his Catholic family and the Protestant royal line that would be continued by Mary&#x27;s half-sister, Elizabeth I.

==Early life==

Thomas was the son of Sir Thomas Howard, later 2nd Duke of Norfolk (1443–1524), by his first wife, Elizabeth Tilney (died 1497), the daughter of Sir Frederick Tilney and widow of Sir Humphrey Bourchier, and the grandson of John Howard, 1st Baron Howard, later 1st Duke of Norfolk. Through his great-grandmother Margaret Mowbray, Howard was a descendant of Thomas of Brotherton, 1st Earl of Norfolk, the sixth son of King Edward I of England. Through his great-grandfather Sir Robert Howard, of Tendring Hall, Stoke-by-Nayland, Suffolk, Howard was descended from Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall, the second son of King John, who had an illegitimate son, named Richard (died 1296), whose daughter, Joan of Cornwall, married Sir John Howard (d. shortly July 1331). Likewise, through his ancestor Isabel d&#x27;Aubigny, wife of John Fitzalan, 3rd Lord of Clun and Oswestry, Howard was descended from Roger Bigod, the first Lord of Norfolk after the Norman conquest. In 1483, his father and grandfather were created Earl of Surrey and Duke of Norfolk respectively in reward for their loyalty to the Duke of Gloucester, who became King Richard III after usurping the throne from his nephews, the sons of Edward IV, and in 1485 the Howards fought on the side of Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth, where the 1st Duke lost his life and the Earl of Surrey was badly wounded. As the battle resulted in the accession of Henry VII Tudor, the Howards&#x27; loyalty to the losing side resulted in the forfeiture of their titles and most of their properties. Nevertheless, they soon began to be rehabilitated, and in 1489 Thomas&#x27; father was restored as Earl of Surrey.

In April 1497 his mother died, and in August of that year, by papal dispensation, his father married for the second time Agnes Tilney, Thomas&#x27; mother&#x27;s cousin.

Howard was an able soldier, and was often employed in military operations. In 1497, he served in a campaign against the Scots under the command of his father, who knighted him on 30 September 1497. He was made a Knight of the Garter after the accession of his nephew by marriage, King Henry VIII, and became the King&#x27;s close companion, with lodgings at court. His first wife, Anne of York, daughter of Edward IV and thereby Henry&#x27;s aunt, died in November 1511, and early in 1513, Howard married Elizabeth Stafford, the daughter of Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Eleanor Percy, and the granddaughter of Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland. Through his mother Katherine Woodville, Elizabeth&#x27;s father was a first cousin to Howard&#x27;s first wife. On 4 May 1513, he was appointed Lord High Admiral, a position previously held by his brother, Edward Howard, who had died on 25 April, to combat the French navy. Surrey and his sons Thomas and Edmund had hoped to lead the English expedition against France, but were left behind when the King departed for Calais at the end of June. Shortly thereafter King James IV of Scotland launched an invasion into England (despite being married to Princess Margaret Tudor, sister of Henry VIII) in fulfilment of his alliance with France, and Thomas along with his brother Edmund, joined their father and the barons Dacre and Monteagle in leading the army, which despite their numerical inferiority, managed to decisively crush the Scottish forces at the Battle of Flodden, near Branxton, Northumberland, on 9 September. The Scots lost thousands of men, and James IV lost his life in the battle.


Leading the victorious forces at Flodden gave the Howards enormous prestige both socially and at court, and the Howard coat of arms was changed in honour of the victory, incorporating the Scottish lion pierced through the mouth with an arrow within a &quot;double tressure flory-counterflory-gules&quot;, an emblem of the Scottish royal arms granted by Scottish kings on rare occasions as a special mark of favour. The grant to Howard was thus a blatant heraldic insult to the kings of Scotland. On 1 February 1514, Howard&#x27;s father, then Earl of Surrey, was created Duke of Norfolk (technically a new creation, but treated for all practical purposes as a recreation of the forfeited title previously held by his father), and by letters patent issued on the same day, Howard was created Earl of Surrey. Both were granted lands in support of their new dignities, although Henry, ever cautious of rivals, scattered the grants across the realm to prevent a Howard landed base in East Anglia. Over the next few years, the younger Thomas Howard served King Henry VIII in a variety of ways. In September 1514, he escorted the King&#x27;s sister Mary to France for her forthcoming marriage to King Louis XII of France. In 1517, he quelled a May Day riot in London with the use of soldiers.

==Rise to power==

On 10 March 1520 Howard was appointed Lord Deputy of Ireland. By July 1520, he entered upon the thankless task of endeavouring to keep Ireland in order. His letters contain accounts of attempts to pacify the rival factions of Gerald FitzGerald, 9th Earl of Kildare and Piers Butler, 8th Earl of Ormonde, and are full of demands for more money and troops.

At the end of 1521 Surrey was recalled from Ireland to take command of the English fleet in naval operations against France. His ships were ill-provisioned, and his attack consisted of a series of raids near the French coast for the purpose of inflicting as much damage as possible on the French navy. Howard&#x27;s ships besieged the strategic port of Brest but when he abandoned the siege, he left Vice-Admiral William FitzWilliam on station to blockade the port. The English navy patrolled the Brittany coast for the next three months, but was unable to gain a decisive victory even with their Spanish allies. In July 1522, the forces commanded by Surrey burned Morlaix, and over the next few months razed everything around Boulogne, until the winter caused the fleet to withdraw to England. The sea patrol was abandoned with little achieved.

On 4 December 1522, Howard was made Lord High Treasurer upon his father&#x27;s resignation of the office, and on 21 May 1524, he succeeded his father as Duke of Norfolk. His liking for war brought him into conflict with Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, who preferred diplomacy in the conduct of foreign affairs. In 1523, Wolsey had secured to Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk the reversion of the office of Earl Marshal by Howard&#x27;s father, and in 1525, he was replaced as Lord Admiral by Henry FitzRoy, Duke of Richmond, the King&#x27;s illegitimate but acknowledged son, who a few years later became Norfolk&#x27;s son-in-law. Finding himself pushed aside, Howard spent considerable time away from court between 1525 and 1527–28.

In the mid-1520s, Howard&#x27;s niece, Anne Boleyn, had caught the eye of King Henry VIII, thereby reviving his political fortunes with his involvement in the King&#x27;s attempt to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon. By 1529, matters of state were being increasingly handled by Norfolk, his brother-in-law Thomas Boleyn, and the Duke of Suffolk, who pressed King Henry VIII to remove Cardinal Wolsey. In October, the King sent Howard and the Duke of Suffolk to obtain the great seal from the Cardinal.

In early 1530, Anne Boleyn was promoting a marriage between her first cousin and eldest son of Norfolk, Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey and the King&#x27;s daughter, Princess Mary. The Duke was enthusiastic about the match as it might give him greater political influence at court and put his family closer to the throne. Boleyn may have considered the match to be a way of neutralising the threat Mary posed to the succession of any children Anne might have by the King. But she changed her mind, fearing that the Duke could use the match to support Mary&#x27;s claim to the throne as well as supporting Catherine of Aragon in the annulment proceedings which were still continuing, and thereby prevent the Church of England&#x27;s break from Rome. By October 1530, Boleyn persuaded her reluctant uncle to arrange instead for Surrey to marry Frances de Vere, one of the daughters of John de Vere, 15th Earl of Oxford with his second wife, Elizabeth Trussell.

In November 1530, Wolsey was arrested but while on his way from York to London the Cardinal became seriously ill and died in Leicester. Howard benefited from Wolsey&#x27;s fall, becoming the King&#x27;s leading councillor and applying himself energetically in the King&#x27;s efforts to find a way out of his marriage to Queen Catherine.

==Later career==

Assisting the King in the annulment of his first marriage, added to his extensive loyalty and services to the Crown, brought Howard extensive rewards in the form of monastic lands in Norfolk and Suffolk, employment on diplomatic missions, and being named a knight of the French Order of St Michael in 1532 and Earl Marshal of England on 28 May 1533. In November of that same year, his daughter Mary married the Duke of Richmond, a union that was politically advantageous to Norfolk. Because as Henry VIII did not yet have a legitimate male heir and Princess Mary had been removed from the line of succession, Richmond was seen by many as a potential heir to the throne. The marriage was never consummated by order of the King due to the youth of the couple, and it was then cut short by FitzRoy&#x27;s death in 1536.

Thomas Howard&#x27;s marriage to his second wife, Lady Elizabeth Stafford, which had apparently been mutually affectionate at first, deteriorated in 1527 when he took a mistress, Elizabeth Holland (died 1547/8), whom he installed in the Howard household. Lady Elizabeth formally separated from her husband in the 1530s. She claimed that in March 1534, the Duke of Norfolk &#x27;locked me up in a chamber, [and] took away my jewels and apparel&#x27;. Howard then moved her to Redbourn, Hertfordshire, where she lived as an actual prisoner with a meagre annual allowance of only £200. She also claimed to have been physically maltreated by Howard and his household servants.

On 10 March 1536, the Earl of Surrey&#x27;s eldest son Thomas was born. On 2 May of the same year, Anne Boleyn and her brother George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford were arrested by order of the King. They were tried in the great hall of the Tower of London. Norfolk presided over the trial as Lord High Steward. The Boleyn siblings were sentenced to death; Rochford was executed on 17 May, and Anne two days later. Following his niece&#x27;s fall from grace, Howard&#x27;s power and influence at court waned for a time.

In July, the Duke of Richmond, Norfolk&#x27;s only son-in-law, died at the age of 17 and was buried at Thetford Priory, one of the Howard properties.

When the Pilgrimage of Grace broke out in Lincolnshire and the northern counties in October 1536 in response to the government-sponsored suppression of monasteries and abbeys across England, Norfolk and his eldest son, the Earl of Surrey shared command of the King&#x27;s forces with George Talbot, 4th Earl of Shrewsbury. The Howards and Shrewsbury opened negotiations with the main leader of the insurgents, Robert Aske at Scawsby Leys, near Doncaster, where Aske had assembled between 30,000 and 40,000 people. The 24 Articles to the King, also called &quot;The Commons&#x27; Petition&quot;, was given to Norfolk to present to the King. The Duke promised to do so, and also promised a general pardon for the rebels, that Parliament would meet in York in a year, and another pardon, this time directed at the abbeys until the Parliament had met. Jesse Childs (a biographer of the Earl of Surrey, Norfolk&#x27;s son) specifically notes that Henry VIII did not authorise Norfolk to grant remedies for the grievances. The Duke&#x27;s enemies had told the King that the Howards could put down a rebellion of peasants if they wanted to, suggesting that Norfolk, being Catholic, sympathised with the Pilgrimage. Howard and Shrewsbury were outnumbered: they had between 5,000 and 7,000 men but there were more than 40,000 rebels. Upon seeing their numbers, Norfolk negotiated and made promises to avoid being massacred by insurgent forces. However, the promises of both the King and Parliament were never fulfilled and in January 1537 Bigod&#x27;s rebellion broke out. In response to this, forces led by Norfolk headed to the north of England, where they carried out a policy of brutal repression on behalf of the King, despite the fact that the Duke himself was a Catholic.

In 1539, Norfolk, who was a conservative, was seriously challenging the reformist religious policies of the King&#x27;s chief minister, Thomas Cromwell. In that year, Henry VIII sought to have Parliament put an end to diversity in religious opinion. On 5 May, the House of Lords appointed a committee to consider questions of doctrine. Although he was not a member of the committee, on 16 May, Howard presented six conservative articles of religion to Parliament for consideration. On 30 May, the Six Articles and the penalties for failure to conform to them were enacted into law, and on 28 June, received royal assent.

In February 1540, Norfolk tried to save Thetford Priory from closure, petitioning Henry VIII for the Priory&#x27;s church to become a collegiate church on the grounds that not only Anne of York, Howard&#x27;s first wife and aunt to the King, but also the monarch&#x27;s illegitimate son, the Duke of Richmond, were buried there. The Dean was to be Prior William Ixworth, and the six prebendaries and eight secular canons to be the monks of the former house. The request had no effect. The same request was made to the King by other nobles, and he refused them all; at the same time however, Henry VIII ordered that the dissolution of the monasteries be briefly suspended, so that everyone who wished had time to rebury the remains of their relations. Howard moved those of his own relations to the Church of St Michael the Archangel, Framlingham. After the dissolution of the monastic church, the lands were given to the Duke.

On 29 June 1539, Howard, the Duke of Suffolk and Cromwell dined with the King as guests of the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Cranmer at Lambeth Palace. During a heated discussion about Cardinal Wolsey, Cromwell charged Thomas Howard with disloyalty; Howard in turn called Cromwell a liar. Their mutual hostility was now out in the open. Cromwell inadvertently played into Howard&#x27;s hands by taking the initiative in the King&#x27;s marriage to Anne of Cleves. The King&#x27;s disillusionment with Anne&#x27;s physical appearance when he met her, and his desire to have the marriage annulled after the wedding had taken place, gave Howard an opportunity to bring down Cromwell. On 10 June 1540 Cromwell was arrested at a Privy Council meeting on charges of high treason, and the Duke of Norfolk snatched the St George&#x27;s collar (insignia of the Order of the Garter) from Cromwell&#x27;s shoulders, saying: &quot;A traitor must not wear it&quot;. On 9 July, King Henry&#x27;s marriage to Anne of Cleves was annulled. 
By then Catherine Howard, another of the Duke&#x27;s nieces, had already caught the King&#x27;s eye. Henry and Catherine were married at a private ceremony at Oatlands Palace on 28 July, the same day that Cromwell was executed. As a result of this marriage, for a time, Howard enjoyed political prominence and material rewards. According to Nicholas Sander, the religiously conservative Howards may have seen Catherine as a figurehead for a fight to restore Catholicism in England.

Despite the fact that the King was much in love with Catherine, referring to her as his &quot;rose without a thorn&quot;, the marriage quickly came to a disastrous end. While Henry and Queen Catherine were on progress during the autumn of 1541, the religious reformer John Lassells and his sister Mary Hall told Archbishop Cranmer of the Queen&#x27;s premarital sexual indiscretions. On 1 November 1541 Cranmer revealed Queen Catherine’s extramarital behaviour in a letter to the King, who vented his wrath on the Howard family, accusing them of concealing the Queen&#x27;s misconduct. Catherine was condemned by a bill of attainder and was executed on 13 February 1542. Various members of the Duke&#x27;s family were punished, including his daughter Mary, his stepmother the widowed Duchess of Norfolk, and the latter&#x27;s son William Howard, who was Thomas&#x27;s half-brother. Norfolk tried to detach himself from the situation by retiring to his residence at Kenninghall, from where he wrote a letter of apology to the King blaming both his niece and his stepmother for the scandal. However, the French ambassador Charles de Marillac wrote on 17 January 1542, that the Duke had not only escaped punishment, but had apparently been restored to his &quot;full former credit and authority&quot;.

Howard was appointed Lieutenant-General north of the River Trent on 29 January 1541, and Captain-General in a campaign against the Scots in August 1542. In June 1543, he declared war on France in the King&#x27;s name and was appointed Lieutenant-General of the army. During the campaign of May–October 1544, he besieged Montreuil, while King Henry VIII captured Boulogne, before returning home. Complaining of lack of provisions and munitions, Howard eventually raised the siege of Montreuil, and realising that Boulogne could not realistically be held by the English for long, he left it garrisoned and withdrew to Calais, for which he was severely rebuked by the King.

==Imprisonment and release==
During the last years of the reign of Henry VIII, the Seymour family, and the King&#x27;s last wife, Catherine Parr, supporters of the Reformation were gaining greater power and influence at court, while conservative Norfolk was left politically isolated. Howard attempted to form an alliance with the Seymours by marrying his widowed daughter, Mary to Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley. The King gave his approval for the match, but her brother, Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, objected strongly, as did the Duchess herself and the marriage did not take place. Howard&#x27;s eldest son and heir, Henry, Earl of Surrey, was repeatedly imprisoned for rash behaviour and was accused of assuming the royal arms of Edward the Confessor as part of his personal heraldry. Surrey was entitled to bear Edward the Confessor&#x27;s arms, but doing so was an act of pride, and provocative in the eyes of the Crown. On 12 December 1546 both Norfolk and his son were arrested and sent to the Tower.

In the early morning of 14 December, Howard&#x27;s residence in Kenninghall was raided by Richard Southwell, John Gates and Wymond Carew, looking for evidence of Surrey&#x27;s treason. Arriving at the house, the men found the Duke&#x27;s daughter, Mary, his daughter-in-law Frances, who was pregnant with their fifth child, and Norfolk&#x27;s mistress, Bess Holland, alone in the home. Southwell and his companions arrived, placed men at all the doors and sent for the Duchess of Richmond and Bess Holland, &#x27;who were only just risen&#x27;, Southwell reported.

The fate of Norfolk&#x27;s personal property is well documented, for the inventories drawn up at the time of his arrest were annotated, as goods were sold or given away.

On 24 December, the elder Howard acknowledged that he had &quot;concealed high treason, in keeping secret the false acts of my son, Henry Earl of Surrey, in using the arms of St. Edward the Confessor, which pertain only to kings&quot;, and offered his lands to the King.

There were also religious motives behind Surrey&#x27;s fall from grace and Norfolk&#x27;s imprisonment. The Duke was the premier Catholic nobleman of England and his son was also a Catholic, although he had reformist leanings. Henry VIII, possibly influenced by the Seymours, supporters of Protestantism, believed that Norfolk and Surrey were going to usurp the Crown from his son, the future Edward VI, to reverse the Reformation and thus return the English Church to papal jurisdiction. Norfolk&#x27;s family, including his estranged wife, his daughter Mary, and his mistress, Elizabeth Holland, all gave evidence against him. His son was convicted of treason and executed on 19 January 1547, and on 27 January 1547, the Howards, father and son, were attainted by statute. The dying King gave his assent to the Duke&#x27;s death through royal commissioners, and it was rumoured that he would be executed on the following day. Norfolk was saved by the King&#x27;s death, in the early morning of 28 January, and the council&#x27;s decision not to inaugurate the new reign with bloodshed, but remained a prisoner in the Tower of London. His estates fell prey to the ruling clique in the reign of Edward VI, for which he was later partly compensated by lands worth £1,626 a year from the Catholic Queen Mary I.

Howard remained in the Tower throughout the reign of Edward VI, being released and pardoned along with the Bishop of Winchester Stephen Gardiner, after the accession of Mary in July 1553. He was appointed to the Privy Council, and presided as Lord High Steward at the trial of the Duke of Northumberland on 18 August. He was also restored to the office of Earl Marshal and officiated in that capacity at Mary&#x27;s coronation on 1 October 1553. In Mary&#x27;s first parliament (October–December of that year), Howard&#x27;s attainder was declared void, thereby restoring him to the dukedom and its subsidiary titles. Because Norfolk&#x27;s son Henry Howard was dead, the courtesy title of Earl of Surrey, which had been left vacant since the execution of Henry six years earlier, devolved upon Henry Howard&#x27;s eldest son Thomas, who was now the Duke&#x27;s heir-apparent.

Shortly after his release, Howard took over the care of his five grandchildren, the Earl of Surrey&#x27;s children, who up to that time had been under the tutelage of John Foxe (Author of &#x27; &quot;Foxe&#x27;s Book of Martyrs&quot;). Howard dismissed him (Foxe soon went into exile to various countries in continental Europe to escape anti-Protestant measures taken by Queen Mary). Shortly after dismissing Foxe, Howard reassigned the education of his grandson and heir Thomas, to Bishop Gardiner, now Lord Chancellor to Queen Mary. Shortly afterwards, however, the Duke once again reassigned the education of his heir, and that of his other grandson Henry, this time to the Catholic priest John White who was soon elected to be Bishop of Lincoln.

In late 1553, Howard arranged for a marriage between Thomas and Mary FitzAlan, one of the daughters of the Earl of Arundel, with the aim of uniting the two most prominent Catholic families in England. In early 1554 the elderly Norfolk carried out his last service to the Crown by leading some of the forces which put down Wyatt&#x27;s Rebellion, a group of disaffected Protestant gentlemen who opposed the Queen&#x27;s projected marriage to Philip II of Spain.

==Death and burial==

The Duke died at his Kenninghall residence on 25 August 1554 after several weeks in which his health gradually declined. Norfolk was buried in the Church of St Michael the Archangel, Framlingham, Suffolk, where his spectacular tomb, richly decorated with religious iconography and with heraldic lions that hold the coats of arms of both the Howard family and the House of York, because Anne of York, the Duke&#x27;s first wife, was buried in the same tomb.

The religious representations on Howard&#x27;s tomb are of the twelve Apostles and some of the oldest Christian saints. On the south side are St Matthew the Evangelist, St James the Great, St James the Less and St Andrew; on the west St Peter, the Prophet Aaron and St Paul; on the north St Matthias, St Jude Thaddeus, Simon the Zealot (also known as Simon the Canaanite) and St Philip; and on the east St John the Evangelist, Simeon of Jerusalem and St Thomas.

Parts of the tomb are believed to be parts of the 2nd Duke&#x27;s tomb, which was located at Thetford and was destroyed when the Priory was closed. The remains of two other men in the tomb are likely the first and second Dukes.

The effigy of Howard is to the left of that of his first wife, rather than the usual right, due to the latter&#x27;s royal lineage. He was succeeded as Duke and as Earl Marshal by his grandson, Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk.

==Marriage and progeny==
Thomas Howard married twice:

*First he married the Princess Anne of York (1475–1511), the fifth daughter of King Edward IV of England and Elizabeth Woodville, and the sister-in-law of King Henry VII. Anne had previously been betrothed to the Austrian Prince Philip, son of the Archduke Maximilian of Austria, but the marriage negotiations were cancelled in 1483, after the death of Edward IV. Thomas and the Princess were distantly related, as both were descendants of King Edward I. Howard was descended from Thomas of Brotherton, the fourth son of Edward I, while Anne was descended from King Edward II, Brotherton&#x27;s half-brother. Arrangements for the marriage between the Princess and Thomas began in March 1484, shortly after she and her six sisters were reinstated at the court of their uncle, Richard III, by an agreement between the King and his sister-in-law, and mother of the girls, the Dowager Queen Elizabeth. The monarch, at that time, promised that his nieces would not be imprisoned in the Tower or any other prison and that they would be placed &quot;in respectable places of good name and reputation&quot;, and later be married to &quot;men of noble birth&quot; and given dowry lands with an annual income of 200 marks each. Shortly after the deal was sealed and the princesses arrived at court, the King began searching for suitable husbands for his nieces: for Anne he chose Thomas Howard. By choosing the son and heir of the Earl of Surrey and second-in-line to the Dukedom of Norfolk, he showed his favour to the Howard family. This was a politically advantageous match on both sides. The following year, in 1485, and when Anne and Thomas were still children, Richard III and the Earl of Surrey agreed to the marriage contract, but the King did not have time to formalize the marriage due to the invasion from Wales of the Lancastrian claimant to the throne, Henry Tudor, and then marriage negotiations were suspended following the monarch&#x27;s death at the Battle of Bosworth. A few years later, Elizabeth of York, eldest sister of the Princess and now wife of the new King Henry VII, resumed negotiations for Anne to marry Thomas. The princess and her future husband had known each other since childhood as both Howard&#x27;s father and grandfather served at the court of Edward IV. The queen took into account the opinion of her sister and considered that the Howard family were noble enough to qualify for a high marriage, and therefore on 4 February 1495 (according to other sources in 1494) the wedding of Anne and Thomas Howard was celebrated. The wedding took place in Westminster Abbey, and the marriage celebrations took place at the Palace of Placentia. The royal family attended the wedding, and the king also attended a festive mass, but the dowry of 10,000 marks, assigned to Anne by her father was not received by the newlyweds. By order of the queen, the couple were assigned annuity payments in the amount of £120 per year, which were to be made throughout Anne&#x27;s life or until the death of her mother-in-law: this amount included provision for the maintenance of Anne herself, as well as her servants and seven horses. This pension was granted because the queen did not want to leave Anne dependent on her husband, who due to his circumstances, could not provide the princess with a comfortable existence suitable to her royal rank. Since the groom&#x27;s father had received only part of the family estate following the Battle of Bosworth, and this had no residence suitable for a woman of royal blood, the newlyweds received the right to use the estates located in the possessions of the Duke of York and the Marquess of Dorset, Anne&#x27;s nephew and half-brother respectively. In return, the queen required that in the event of the death of Howard&#x27;s father the Earl of Surrey or his wife (a wealthy heiress), Anne&#x27;s interests should be taken into account on an equal basis with the interests of her husband. The king allocated his new sister-in-law another £26 per year from Crown lands. By Anne, he had four children, none of whom survived to adulthood. Anne died in November 1511, being buried in the first instance in Thetford Priory, then the burial place and mausoleum of members of the Howard family. When the Priory was closed during the Reformation, her remains were moved to St Michael the Archangel&#x27;s Church, Framlingham, Suffolk.
*Secondly, early in 1513, he married Lady Elizabeth Stafford, daughter of Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham, by his wife Eleanor Percy, daughter of Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland. Through her paternal grandmother, Catherine Woodville, Elizabeth was a cousin of Howard&#x27;s first wife. By Elizabeth, he had five children:
**Henry Howard (1516/7–1547), who automatically became Earl of Surrey when his father became 3rd Duke of Norfolk in 1524. In 1532/3 he married Lady Frances de Vere, daughter of John de Vere, 15th Earl of Oxford, by whom he had two sons and three daughters: Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk; Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton; Catherine Howard, who married Henry Berkeley, 7th Baron Berkeley; Margaret Howard, who married Henry Scrope, 9th Baron Scrope of Bolton; and Jane Howard, who married Charles Neville, 6th Earl of Westmorland.
**Catherine Howard (1518–1530), who by 9 December 1529 married Edward Stanley, 3rd Earl of Derby (1509–1572). After Catherine&#x27;s death in March 1530, Derby married a second time to Dorothy Howard, his first wife&#x27;s aunt.
**Mary Howard (1519–1557), who married, on 28 November 1533, King Henry VIII&#x27;s illegitimate son, Henry FitzRoy (1519–1536), by whom she had no issue. The marriage was never consummated due to FitzRoy&#x27;s death a few years later.
**Thomas Howard, 1st Viscount Howard of Bindon (1520–1582), who married firstly Elizabeth Marney, secondly Gertrude Lyte, thirdly Mabel Burton, and fourthly Margaret Manning.
**Muriel Howard (1521–). Died young

As dowager duchess, Elizabeth survived a few years after her husband&#x27;s death, dying in November 1558. She was buried in the Church of St Mary-at-Lambeth, Surrey.

<doc id="233858" wikidata="Q2956374" url="?curid=233858" title="Chanter">
<text>The chanter is the part of the bagpipe upon which the player creates the melody. It consists of a number of finger-holes, and in its simpler forms looks similar to a recorder. On more elaborate bagpipes, such as the Northumbrian bagpipes or the Uilleann pipes, it also may have a number of keys, to increase the instrument&#x27;s range and/or the number of keys (in the modal sense) it can play in. Like the rest of the bagpipe, they are often decorated with a variety of substances, including metal (silver/nickel/gold/brass), bone, ivory, or plastic mountings.

==Cylindrical vs. conical bore==
Chanters come in two main types, parallel and non-parallel bored (although there is no clear dividing line between the two). 
This refers to the shape of the internal bore of the chanter. 
On the Great Highland Bagpipe, the internal bore is conical: it is this that gives the chanter its exceptional volume. 
The Northumbrian pipes, on the other hand, have a parallel bore, giving them a much sweeter and quieter tone.

==Keyed chanter==
Although the majority of chanters are unkeyed, some make extensive use of keys to extend the range and/or the number of accidentals the chanter can play. The most common pipe featuring this arrangement is the Northumbrian smallpipe.

==Double chanter==
Another variant of the chanter is the two-piped chanter (often called a double chanter). The chanter pipes may be designed to be played separately, one with each hand, or the two chanters may be played in unison (as in most Arabic bagpipes). One chanter may provide a drone accompaniment to the other, or the two chanters may play in a harmony of thirds and sixths (as in the northern Italian Müsa and central-southern Italian &quot;zampogna&quot;). In pipes of the Carpathian basin up to five separate chanter bores may be placed in parallel within a single chanter assembly, providing both melodic and rhythmic possibilities: in the simplest case, one pipe is used to play the melody while the second provides a variable drone, while more complex pipes may separate certain individual notes into separate, stopped pipes.

==Intonation==
Because of the accompanying drone or drones, the lack of modulation in bagpipe melody, and stable timbre of the reed sound, in many bagpipe traditions the tones of the chanter are tuned using just intonation, although bagpipe tuning is highly variable across traditions. On the Great Highland bagpipe, tuning of the individual notes of the chanter is done using tape to slightly cover the finger holes as needed. Historically, it was done with wax, as was done with other woodwind instruments.

==Practice chanter==
The practice chanter is used as a practice instrument for the Great Highland Bagpipe. It is somewhat similar in appearance, though slightly smaller than the bagpipe chanter, and has a top piece before the reed so it can be blown directly from the mouth. It is also used as a first instrument so that learners can initially learn the finger technique before learning the mechanics of controlling the bag. It is almost exclusively made of hardwood or plastic. 

The practice chanter of today may also be a descendant of the hornpipe or &quot;stock-and-horn&quot;, a historical reed pipe of Scotland with a capped double reed and bell made of horn, played by shepherds, among others.

<doc id="233859" wikidata="Q278130" url="?curid=233859" title="Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk">
<text>Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, (10 March 1536 or 1538 2 June 1572), was an English nobleman and politician. He was a second cousin of Queen Elizabeth I and held many high offices during the earlier part of her reign.

Norfolk was the son of the poet, soldier and politician Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey. He was executed for his role in the Ridolfi plot.

==Early life, family, and religion==


Thomas was born on 10 March 1536 (although some sources cite his birth in 1538) at Kenninghall, Norfolk, being the first or second of five children of Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, and his wife Lady Frances de Vere. His paternal grandparents were Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, and Lady Elizabeth Stafford. His maternal grandparents were John de Vere, 15th Earl of Oxford, and Lady Elizabeth Trussell. His siblings were Jane born in 1533 or 1537, Henry born in 1540, Katherine born in 1543, and Margaret born in 1547, shortly after their father&#x27;s execution. Between his maternal and paternal families, the religious differences were notable: his maternal grandfather was a supporter of the Reformation and was the first Protestant earl of Oxford, whereas his paternal grandfather was the premier Roman Catholic nobleman of England although he had complied with the changes in the governance of the Church of England brought about by Henry VIII, and served the King in suppressing rebellion against those changes.

Thomas&#x27; father, the Earl of Surrey, a Catholic but with reformist leanings, was heir to the 3rd Duke, and thereby destined to become the future 4th Duke; but that changed at the end of 1546 when Surrey quartered the royal arms of Edward the Confessor on his own coat of arms, incurring the fury of Henry VIII. Through his great-grandfather John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk (1483 creation), Surrey was a descendant of Thomas of Brotherton, 1st Earl of Norfolk, the sixth son of King Edward I; and the arms of the Howard ancestor Thomas de Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk (1397 creation), show that Surrey was entitled to bear Edward the Confessor&#x27;s arms; but to do so was an act of pride, and provocative in the eyes of the Crown. Henry VIII was also possibly influenced by the Seymours, who were enemies of the Howard family, supporters of Protestantism and related to Henry&#x27;s son Prince Edward, since the Prince was the son of Henry&#x27;s third wife Jane Seymour. Henry, who was increasingly unwell, became convinced that Surrey and his father planned to usurp the crown from Edward in order to reverse the Reformation and return the English Church to papal jurisdiction. He ordered the arrest of the Duke and his son, both of them being tried for high treason and later sentenced to death; Surrey was executed on 19 January 1547. The Duke&#x27;s execution was scheduled for 28 January but did not take place because Henry VIII died in the early hours of the same day, the Privy Council made a decision not to inaugurate the new reign with bloodshed, but Howard remained a prisoner in the Tower of London for the next six years, with most of his property and titles forfeit to the Crown.

Initially Surrey and his wife, Lady Frances, entrusted the education of their children to the Dutch physician and classical scholar Hadrianus Junius (the 3rd Duke and Surrey were patrons of the Dutchman), who was responsible for giving the Howard children a humanistic education, but after the fall In disgrace to his patron, Junius lost his job as the children&#x27;s tutor. After Surrey&#x27;s death, his sister Mary Howard, Dowager Duchess of Richmond, took over the care of his children and John Foxe, the Protestant martyrologist was employed to be their tutor, at the suggestion of Lord Wentworth. During that time, they lived in Reigate Castle, one of the residences belonging to the 3rd Duke. From Foxe, the children learned Greek and Latin to a level where they &quot;could compete with the most learned men of the age&quot;. Charles Howard, a first cousin from Surrey born the same year as Thomas, also studied and brought up with the children at Reigate. Despite losing his position as tutor six years later, Foxe remained an important recipient of Thomas&#x27; patronage for the rest of Howard&#x27;s life. Although both Thomas and his siblings received a Protestant education, they were Catholics, as were most of their paternal family, who remained loyal to the Roman Church during the turbulence of the Reformation. His father fell out of favour in part because he had been a Catholic, and his grandfather remained a prisoner in the Tower throughout the reign of Edward VI, being released and pardoned in July 1553, shortly after the Catholic Queen Mary I ascended the throne. As soon as the 3rd Duke was released, he took charge of his grandchildren and dismissed Foxe, who soon went into exile in various countries in Continental Europe to escape the anti-Protestant measures taken by Queen Mary. Thomas then studied for a while at the home of the Bishop of Winchester and later Lord Chancellor Stephen Gardiner. A short time later, he joined his brother Henry and continued his education at the London home of the Catholic Priest John White, who in March 1554 was elected Bishop of Lincoln.

==Career==

Because his father had died before his grandfather, Thomas was now in line to become 4th Duke of Norfolk. In December 1553 he received the courtesy title of Earl of Surrey, a subsidiary title of the dukes, when Queen Mary approved the &quot;Duke of Norfolk&#x27;s Restitution Act&quot;, which declared void the attainder of the Howards, and returned to the 3rd Duke the titles and estates forfeited more than six years earlier. In early 1554, the new Earl of Surrey accompanied his grandfather in leading the forces that suppressed the Wyatt&#x27;s Rebellion, led by a group of Protestant knights who opposed Queen&#x27;s projected marriage to Philip II of Spain. This was the last service to the crown for the elderly 3rd Duke. In May of that same year, the manors of Gaywood and Rising were returned to Howard. In July, Thomas became first Gentleman of the Chamber to Philip.

Following his grandfather&#x27;s death on 25 August 1554, Thomas succeeded him as 4th Duke and hereditary Earl Marshal of England. Howard had been preparing over the previous months to gradually take charge of the vast family inheritance received, although because he was still a minor at the time of his grandfather&#x27;s death, guardianship of the new Duke was left in the hands of Queen Mary. Despite this, Howard was able to make some decisions such as organising his grandfather&#x27;s funeral and burial in St Michael the Archangel&#x27;s Church, Framlingham, and making the necessary arrangements for the guardianship of his sisters. Bassingbourne Gawdy, one of the lawyers in charge of the succession to Howard&#x27;s estates, rode post haste to London with letters for Lord Chancellor Gardiner and returned as speedily as he could to Norwich. The escheator of Norfolk held a formal inquisition to survey the great Howard inheritance, of fifty-six manors, and &#x27;many other considerable estates&#x27;, which passed for the present into the hands of the Crown, until Thomas came of age. His younger siblings would also receive 1,000 marks each on coming of age, or marriage, according to the terms of their grandfather&#x27;s will. Once he came of age in March 1557, Howard was able to administer all his estates, becoming one of the richest landowners in England.

In September 1554, Thomas arranged for the marriage of his sister Katherine to Henry Berkeley, 7th Baron Berkeley; this took place at Howard&#x27;s mansion at Kenninghall.

Queen Mary died in November 1558 and was succeeded by her Protestant half-sister Elizabeth I. Howard was a second cousin of Elizabeth through her maternal grandmother, Lady Elizabeth Howard, sister of the 3rd Duke and mother of Anne Boleyn, and he was trusted with public office despite his family history and being Catholic.

As Earl Marshal, Howard was in charge of organising Elizabeth&#x27;s coronation on 15 January 1559 and the celebrations afterwards. Shortly after ascending the throne, the Queen made Norfolk a Knight of the Garter. Although favoured by Elizabeth, Norfolk was jealous of the greater measure of confidence she placed in Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester. Furthermore, Howard considered William Cecil, Elizabeth&#x27;s Secretary of State, to be &quot;Low Born&quot;. In November 1559, Howard was appointed Lieutenant-General of the North, a position previously held by Henry Neville, 5th Earl of Westmorland, Norfolk&#x27;s cousin, and which the Duke reluctantly accepted, probably seeing it as a means of distancing himself from the disputes he had with some members of the court. He was given command of the army that would intervene in Scotland to support the Lords of the Congregation, a group of Protestant nobles opposed to the pro-French government of the regent, Mary of Guise, mother of Mary, Queen of Scots, who was then living in France. By his side were placed a man of military experience, James Croft, and the diplomat and politician Sir Ralph Sadler, both with vast knowledge of Scottish political affairs. Howard immediately left for the north, arriving at Berwick in early January 1560. His duty was to provide forces for the defence of the town against a possible French attack, to open up communications with the leader of the Congregation, James Hamilton, Duke of Châtellerault and cautiously aid them in their measures against the regent. Norfolk was one of the negotiators of the Treaty of Berwick, signed in February 1560 and by which the Congregation invited English assistance, and was able to return to court after Cecil and his collaborators arrived in Edinburgh in July of the same year to sign the Treaty of Edinburgh which ended English assistance.

==Mary, Queen of Scots, and the Rising of the North==
Norfolk was the principal commissioner at the conference held in York in October 1568 to hear evidence against Mary, Queen of Scots, who had been a prisoner in England since she fled Scotland in May of that same year after being defeated at the Battle of Langside and abdicating under duress. The evidence was presented by Mary&#x27;s illegitimate half-brother James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray, who was also Scottish regent because Mary&#x27;s son King James VI was still a young child. The evidence included the casket letters, which came to light during the investigations carried out in relation to Mary&#x27;s alleged involvement in the murder a year earlier of her second husband Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley.

Having recently lost his third wife, and despite having presided over the York commission, Norfolk began planning his marriage to Mary. For both parties, it would have been their fourth marriage; Howard had been widowed three times, whilst Mary had been widowed twice and her third husband, James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell, had escaped but ended up as a prisoner in Denmark. Both Howard and Mary were descended from the House of Plantagenet. Furthermore, the former Scottish monarch had a strong claim to the English crown as a descendant of Henry VII, the first monarch of the reigning Tudor dynasty, through her paternal grandmother Margaret Tudor and already considered herself the rightful queen of England, on the grounds that Elizabeth had been declared illegitimate following the annulment of the marriage of her parents, Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn in 1536. Most English Catholics also considered Elizabeth to be illegitimate, as her parents&#x27; marriage was never validated by the Holy See. Because the English monarch had no direct heirs, having never married, Mary&#x27;s claim to the throne, who was Catholic, represented a serious threat to the continuity of the Protestant religious policies enacted by the Elizabethan government. Both the Scottish statesman William Maitland of Lethington and the Bishop of Ross, John Lesley, Mary&#x27;s chief adviser and agent, were in favour of the Duke&#x27;s marriage to the former Scottish queen, and Mary herself consented to it, although Howard was initially reluctant to bring about political and religious change. Initially Howard showed little sympathy for Mary, but during recesses from the conference in York, Maitland met privately with Norfolk, suggesting to the Duke the possibility of marrying Mary, as well as a possible future marriage between Howard&#x27;s daughter, Margaret and the infant King James VI. Norfolk saw in this proposal not only the means to solve the succession crisis which had plagued England ever since Elizabeth&#x27;s accession, given her reluctance to marry and produce an heir, but also an opportunity for his own social aggrandisement. Furthermore, Mary&#x27;s marriage to the leading English nobleman would help the former Scottish monarch to strengthen her claim to the throne.

Initially, the relationship between Norfolk and the former Scottish sovereign was platonic and they communicated through letters. Mary sent Norfolk a gift of a pillow embroidered with the Stewart family motto &quot;Virescit vulnere virtus&quot; (courage grows strong at a wound) and her coat of arms. The Duke, through Lord Boyd, a member of Mary&#x27;s private circle, sent a diamond to be delivered to her as a token of his affection and fidelity. Mary, grateful for the gift, wrote to Norfolk in December 1569 that she &quot;I took the diamant from my lord Boyd, which I shall kepe unseene about my neck till I give it agayn to the owner of it and me both.&quot;.

A marriage to Mary would have given the Duke a political advantage at court, as he was by now a rival of Elizabeth&#x27;s favourite, Dudley, and an enemy of Cecil. The marriage scheme was supported by most of the Catholic nobility, and some assumed that the Duke was willing to lead a revolt against Elizabeth. In November 1569 the Rising of the North broke out, organised by Charles Neville, 6th Earl of Westmorland, brother-in-law and also second cousin of Norfolk, and Thomas Percy, 7th Earl of Northumberland after they misinterpreted Norfolk’s sudden withdrawal from court as a sign that they should rebel. Howard briefly participated in the revolt, hoping that if he succeeded, he would achieve the release of Mary, who was then being held in Tutbury Castle. The rebels hoped to receive military aid from Spain, as well as possibly from France. It is still debated whether the rebellion actually aimed to overthrow Elizabeth, and whether Mary even knew about it beforehand. After initial successes, Westmorland and Northumberland retreated northward and finally dispersed their forces, fleeing into Scotland when Elizabeth sent an army under Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex, to quell the rebellion. Norfolk tried to stop the revolt when he saw that it was going to fail, but Elizabeth ordered his arrest after receiving news that the rising had taken place.

Norfolk was a prisoner in the Tower of London until August 1570 when he was released for lack of evidence, and also because he confessed his intentions and begged the Queen for mercy. Thomas&#x27; intention to marry Mary, although objectionable to Elizabeth, was not a sufficient reason to charge him with treason, and also at that time there was insufficient evidence against Howard since he was not directly involved in the revolt in the north.

== Involvement in the Ridolfi plot and execution==
Shortly after Howard was released Roberto Ridolfi, an Italian merchant and banker who lived in London at the time, contacted the Duke to negotiate his participation in the eponymous plot to free Mary, put her on the English throne and thus restore Catholicism in England. Ridolfi, a fervent Catholic who was also an agent of the Holy See, oversaw financing of the Rising of the North and had been plotting to overthrow Elizabeth since 1569, began preparing the Plot based on the Bull &quot;Regnans in Excelsis&quot; issued by Pope Pius V in February 1570, which excommunicated Elizabeth and urged Catholics to do all they could to depose her. The Spanish intelligence service was going to participate. Howard had already come into contact with Philip II of Spain regarding a proposed invasion of England with troops commanded by Fernando Alvarez de Toledo y Pimentel, 3rd Duke of Alba, who was based in the Spanish Netherlands. During the negotiations, Norfolk gave Ridolfi verbal assurances that he was a Catholic, despite the fact that he had been educated as a Protestant. After some hesitation, Howard placed himself at the head of the conspirators; and in return for his services he asked the Spanish king &quot;to approve of my own marriage with the Queen of Scots.“.

In March 1571, the Elizabethan government&#x27;s intelligence network warned that a plot against the Queen&#x27;s life was being prepared. By gaining the confidence of Spain&#x27;s ambassador to England, John Hawkins learned the details of the conspiracy and notified the government so as to arrest the plotters. Elizabeth was also sent a private letter warning by Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, who had learned of the plot against her. Charles Baillie, Ridolfi&#x27;s messenger, was arrested on c.12 April 1571 at Dover for carrying compromising letters, and by the use of torture and prison informers such as William Herle, he was forced to reveal the cipher of the messages he carried.

On 29 August, Norfolk&#x27;s secretaries William Barker and Robert Higford entrusted to Thomas Browne, a Shrewsbury drapers merchant, what was purported to be a bag of silver coin for delivery to Laurence Bannister, one of Norfolk&#x27;s officials in the north of England. Browne grew suspicious of the bag&#x27;s weight, opened it, and discovered gold to the value of 600 pounds sterling from the French ambassador, destined for Scotland on Mary&#x27;s behalf, and ciphered letters. Because he knew Norfolk was under suspicion, Browne reported his find to Cecil. Higford and Barker were interrogated, the letters were partly deciphered, and a search for the cipher key at Howard House uncovered a ciphered letter from Mary hidden under a doormat. Norfolk&#x27;s servants were arrested and interrogated, and confessions were extracted from them by threats or application of torture. Sir Thomas Smith and Thomas Wilson were sent to confront Norfolk, who claimed the money was for his own private purposes. The deciphered letter, however, proved that he was lying. Unaware of his servants&#x27; confessions or the survival of letters which, contrary to his instructions, had not been burnt, he denied the charges against him. Norfolk was imprisoned in the Tower on 5 September.

Laurence Bannister testified on favour of Norfolk, clarifying that the Duke&#x27;s brother, Henry, was the one who really intended to marry the former Scottish queen.

Norfolk initially denied all charges against him, but later admitted a degree of involvement in the transmission of money and correspondence to Mary&#x27;s Scottish supporters and her participation in the Ridolfi plot. The evidence to prosecute Norfolk was now much stronger than in 1569–70, as it was clear that he had been involved in a conspiracy with support from the Papacy, Spain and possibly France, to overthrow and assassinate Elizabeth. At his trial on 16 January 1572, which lasted twelve hours, Norfolk pleaded his innocence. However, the jury of peers unanimously found him guilty of high treason, and he was sentenced to death.

After Norfolk had been sentenced, it was reasonable to suppose that his execution would quickly follow. It was rumoured that he was to be executed on 31 January, whereupon crowds flocked to the Tower. Elizabeth, torn between the demands of justice on the one hand and Norfolk&#x27;s &#x27;nearness of blood [and] ... his superiority of honour&#x27; on the other, did not sign the warrant until 9 February, and on the next day she countermanded her instructions. She did the same thing a fortnight later, to the dismay of Cecil (now ennobled as Lord Burghley) and the Privy Council. They insisted that Parliament be assembled to debate the threat posed by Norfolk and Mary, although Elizabethan parliaments normally met only every three or four years and the previous parliament had been dissolved only ten months earlier.

The new Parliament, the fourth of Elizabeth&#x27;s reign, assembled on 8 May 1572. Over the course of the next three weeks Burghley and the Council used their spokesmen in the House of Commons to press the case for executing Norfolk. On 21 May, Leicester remarked that he could &#x27;see no likelihood&#x27; that Norfolk would be executed. In late May, two Council members went so far as to observe that by failing to execute the Duke, the Queen was demonstrating that she believed the guilty verdict to be incorrect, which &#x27;dishonoureth the nobles that have condemned him&#x27;. The Queen continued to resist re-signing the order, until her opinion suddenly changed when she encountered strong parliamentary pressure calling for the executions of both Norfolk and Mary. As Stephen Alford has observed, Norfolk&#x27;s execution &#x27;was the political price Elizabeth had to pay to save the Scottish Queen&#x27;. Even so, Elizabeth was determined that the decision to execute the Duke should be seen to be hers rather than Parliament&#x27;s. On Saturday, 31 May, the Crown&#x27;s spokesmen in the Commons persuaded the lower house, with great difficulty, to postpone petitioning the Queen to execute the Duke until the following Monday (2 June), &#x27;in hope to hear news before that time&#x27;. The hint was well taken, as Norfolk finally went to the block less than one hour before the Commons reassembled.

During his last days, Howard was visited by his former tutor Foxe, who gave him for the purpose of consolation a version in Latin of his Book of Martyrs. Norfolk bequeathed to Foxe an annuity of £20 per year. The Duke also wrote to his mother&#x27;s second husband, Thomas Steyning, asking that she be sent to the quiet of the countryside. Norfolk feared that if his mother was in London on the day of his execution, she might suffer health problems from shock.

At sunrise on 2 June 1572, Norfolk was led to a specially erected scaffold on Tower Hill, accompanied by Foxe and by Alexander Nowell, Dean of St Paul&#x27;s. He addressed the crowd assembled to witness the execution. Despite admitting that he deserved to die, he declared himself to be partly innocent, whereupon he was interrupted by an official, who warned him that he should not try to clear himself, having been &#x27;tried as honourably as any nobleman hath ever been in this land&#x27;. Urged to wind up quickly, as &#x27;the hour is passed&#x27;, Norfolk ended his speech by denying that he was a Catholic, as was commonly believed. After bidding a tearful farewell to Foxe and Nowell, and forgiving the executioner, the Duke removed his doublet and laid his head on the block. Howard said the final prayer &quot;Lord into your hands I commend my spirit&quot;, the last words Jesus Christ said on the Cross before dying, according to the Gospel of Saint Luke, and then, before a silent crowd, which had been urged not to shout out to avoid &#x27;frighting&#x27; his soul, the Duke&#x27;s head was severed with a single stroke. Howard was between aged 34 or 36 at the time of his death.

Norfolk was the first nobleman to be executed during Elizabeth&#x27;s reign, and was the first since Henry Grey, Duke of Suffolk, the father of Lady Jane Grey, was executed early in Mary I&#x27;s reign. Equally striking was that he was the premier nobleman of England, the Queen&#x27;s second cousin and a leading member of the Privy Council. Until recently, he had also been much admired by Elizabeth and Burghley. Indeed, in 1565 Cecil had described Norfolk as &#x27;wise, just, modest, careful&#x27; and, despite his youth – he was then aged 27 or 29 – &#x27;a father and stay to this country&#x27;. In the immediate aftermath of his execution, Elizabeth was reportedly &#x27;somewhat sad&#x27; at the Duke&#x27;s death. Norfolk was buried in Chapel of St. Peter ad Vincula, in the Tower of London.

Norfolk&#x27;s lands and titles were forfeit, although much of his estate was later restored to his sons. The dukedom was restored, four generations later, to his great-great-grandson Thomas Howard.

Mary narrowly escaped execution on that occasion, but after being implicated in several subsequent Catholic plots, she finally fell from grace and was executed in February 1587.

==Marriages and issue==

===First wife===

In March 1555, the Duke, then aged between 16 or 19, married his first wife, Lady Mary FitzAlan, who was aged 14 or 15. Lady Mary was the youngest daughter of Henry FitzAlan, 12th Earl of Arundel, by his first wife, Lady Katherine Grey. The marriage was arranged by the 3rd Duke in late 1553 with the aim of uniting the two most prominent Catholic families in England. Norfolk and Lady Mary were distantly related because through the lineages of their paternal grandparents, Howard was descended from Richard FitzAlan, 4th Earl of Arundel, and his father, the 3rd Earl of Arundel. Lady Mary was a direct descendant of both Earls of Arundel. They also shared ancestry from the House of Percy because Norfolk&#x27;s paternal great-grandmother Eleanor Percy was the sister of Anne Percy, Lady Mary&#x27;s paternal grandmother. Because the 4th Duke was still a minor and a ward of Queen Mary, Howard needed royal permission to marry Lady Mary FitzAlan. Lady Mary and her sister Jane became co-heirs to the Earldom of Arundel in 1556 after the death of their only brother, Henry, Lord Maltravers. Thomas&#x27;s marriage to Mary brought as dowry many of the estates that Henry FitzAlan, Lady Mary&#x27;s father, owned in Sussex, including Arundel Castle. Those FitzAlan properties were merged with Howard&#x27;s properties in Norfolk. Mary became pregnant at the end of 1556, giving birth at Arundel House, Strand, London, on 28 June 1557, to what would be her only child:

* Philip Howard, Earl of Surrey (by courtesy) from 1557 to 1572. Following the death of his mother and years later his maternal aunt, Jane, Philip became sole heir to the Arundel earldom and all the FitzAlan family estates. After the death of his maternal grandfather in 1580, Philip became the 13th Earl of Arundel. For remaining loyal to Catholicism, he was imprisoned in the Tower of London in April 1585, remaining there until his death from natural causes in October 1595. Shortly after his death he was declared a Catholic martyr, and he was canonised in 1970 as one of the so-called Forty Martyrs of England and Wales. His tomb and shrine are in Arundel Cathedral.

It is from this marriage that Howard&#x27;s descendants, the modern dukes of Norfolk, derive their surname of FitzAlan-Howard and their seat in Arundel.

The Duchess suffered serious health complications after the birth of Philip, possibly due to puerperal fever and died at Arundel House in August 1557. She was buried on 1 September 1557 in the Church of St Clement Danes, Temple Bar, London. Decades later, based on the provisions of the will of her grandson Thomas Howard, 14th Earl of Arundel, her remains were moved to the Fitzalan Chapel in Arundel. A spectacular tomb containing the funerary effigies of both Lady Mary and Margaret Audley, her first cousin and Norfolk&#x27;s second wife, dressed in their peerage robes, was built a few years later in St Michael the Archangel&#x27;s Church, Framlingham, Suffolk, but Lady Mary was never buried there.

===Second wife===

In early 1558, Norfolk became betrothed to Margaret Audley, widow of Sir Henry Dudley and daughter of Thomas Audley, 1st Baron Audley of Walden, and his second wife Elizabeth Grey. Thus Margaret was a first cousin of Mary FitzAlan and in order for the marriage to be valid under Catholic canon law, a dispensation had to be requested from Pope Paul IV, due to the close relationship between Thomas&#x27; first wife and Audley. Howard sent lawyers to Rome to negotiate for the dispensation, but the Holy See was notorious for its delays where dispensations were concerned. These delays, added to the fact that in November of the same year Queen Mary died and was succeeded by Queen Elizabeth, who began to restore Protestantism, led to the marriage being celebrated without the dispensation. It was ratified by Parliament in March 1559. Margaret brought as dowry to her marriage with Howard the entirety of the extensive properties that she had inherited from her father in Essex, including the magnificent Audley End residence.

Norfolk&#x27;s children by his marriage to Margaret were:

* Lady Elizabeth Howard (1560–?), who died in early childhood. She was buried in St Michael the Archangel&#x27;s Church, Framlingham.
* Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk (1561–1626), who firstly married his step-sister, Mary Dacre, without issue. He married secondly Katherine Knyvet c. 1583 and had issue.
* Lady Margaret Howard (1562–1591), who married Robert Sackville, 2nd Earl of Dorset, and had issue.
* Lord William Howard of Naworth Castle and Henderskelfe Castle (now the site of Castle Howard) (1563–1640), who married his step-sister Elizabeth Dacre and had issue. The Earls of Carlisle are direct descendants of Lord William.

At Christmas 1563, Margaret, anxious to be reunited with her husband, left Audley End, despite being still weak from the birth of her fourth child a few days before. During the journey she fell ill with a respiratory condition that worsened as the days passed, and she died in Norwich on 9 January 1564. The Duchess was buried in the first instance in St. John the Baptist&#x27;s Church in Norwich, although shortly afterwards her remains were moved to St Michael the Archangel&#x27;s Church, Framlingham, where her tomb is located, richly decorated with heraldic quarters and her funerary effigy, which is displayed with the peerage robes.

===Third wife===
Shortly after Margaret&#x27;s death, Norfolk married Elizabeth Leyburne (15364 September 1567), widow of Thomas Dacre, 4th Baron Dacre of Gillesland, and daughter of Sir James Leyburn. They had no living children.

Norfolk&#x27;s three sons by his first two wives, Philip, Thomas and William, married, respectively, Anne, Mary, and Elizabeth Dacre. The Dacre sisters were the daughters of Elizabeth Leyburne by her marriage to Thomas Dacre and were therefore stepsisters to Norfolk&#x27;s sons.

Elizabeth died in September 1567, shortly after giving birth to a baby, whose sex is not known and who also died. She was buried at St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Kenninghall.

== Family tree ==
Through his maternal and paternal lineages, Howard was related to the most important families of the English and Welsh nobility. Through his ancestor Jacquetta of Luxembourg, he was related to the House of Luxembourg, descended from Italian nobility (Orsini family) and from French nobility. Through his maternal great-great-grandfather, Sir John Donne, Howard was a descendant of Owain Glyndŵr, the last native prince of Wales.

==Depictions==
*Thomas Howard appears as a character in the Philippa Gregory novels &quot;The Virgin&#x27;s Lover&quot; and &quot;The Other Queen&quot;, and in the novel &quot;I, Elizabeth&quot; by Rosalind Miles.
*A villainized version of the Duke, played by Christopher Eccleston, is in the 1998 film &quot;Elizabeth&quot;. 
*Another version of the Duke is in the BBC mini-series &quot;The Virgin Queen&quot;, played by Kevin McKidd.
*In the Channel 4 documentary &quot;Elizabeth&quot; (2000) presented by David Starkey, the Duke is portrayed by actor John Gully.

<doc id="233862" wikidata="Q777288" url="?curid=233862" title="List of governors of Arizona">
<text>The governor of Arizona is the head of government of the U.S. state of Arizona. As the top elected official, the governor is the head of the executive branch of the Arizona state government and is charged with faithfully executing state laws. The governor has the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Arizona State Legislature; to convene the legislature; and to grant pardons, with the exception of cases of impeachment. The governor is also the commander-in-chief of the state&#x27;s military forces. Arizona is one of the few states that currently does not have a governor&#x27;s mansion or other official residence.

Twenty-four people have served as governor over 28 distinct terms. All of the repeat governors were in the state&#x27;s earliest years, when George W. P. Hunt and Thomas Edward Campbell alternated as governor for 17 years and, after a two-year gap, Hunt served another term. One governor, Evan Mecham, was successfully impeached, and one, Fife Symington, resigned upon being convicted of a felony. The longest-serving governor was Hunt, who was elected seven times and served just under fourteen years. The longest single stint was that of Bruce Babbitt, who was elected to two four-year terms after succeeding to the office following the death of his predecessor, Wesley Bolin, serving nearly nine years total. Bolin had the shortest tenure, dying less than five months after succeeding as governor. Arizona has had five female governors, the most in the United States, and was the first—and until 2019 (when Michelle Lujan Grisham succeeded Susana Martinez in neighboring New Mexico) the &quot;only&quot;—state where female governors served consecutively.

The current governor as of January 2, 2023, is Democrat Katie Hobbs.

==List of governors==

===Confederate Arizona===
In Tucson between April 2 and April 5, 1860, a convention of settlers from the southern half of New Mexico Territory drafted a provisional constitution for &quot;Arizona Territory&quot;, three years before the United States would create such a territory. This proposed territory consisted of the part of New Mexico Territory south of 33° 40&#x27; north. On April 2, they elected a governor, Lewis S. Owings. The provisional territory was to exist until such time as an official territory was created, but that proposal was rejected by Congress at the time.

On March 16, 1861, soon before the American Civil War broke out, a convention in Mesilla voted that the provisional territory should secede from the Union and join the Confederacy. Lewis S. Owings remained on as the provisional governor of the territory.

The Confederacy took ownership of the territory on August 1, 1861, when forces led by Lieutenant Colonel John R. Baylor won decisive control of the territory, and Baylor proclaimed himself governor. Arizona Territory was formally organized in the Confederacy on January 18, 1862. On March 20, 1862, Baylor issued an order to kill all the adult Apache and take their children into slavery. When Confederate President Jefferson Davis learned of this order, he strongly disapproved and demanded an explanation. Baylor wrote a letter December 29, 1862, to justify his decision, and after this was received, Davis relieved Baylor of his post and commission, calling his letter an &quot;avowal of an infamous crime&quot;. By that time, the Confederate government of Arizona Territory was in exile in San Antonio, Texas, as the territory had been effectively lost to Union forces in July 1862; no new governor was appointed.

===Territory of Arizona===

Arizona Territory was formed on February 24, 1863, from New Mexico Territory, remaining a territory for 49 years.


===State of Arizona===
The state of Arizona was admitted to the Union on February 14, 1912, the last of the contiguous states to be admitted.

The state constitution of 1912 called for the election of a governor every two years. The term was increased to four years by a 1968 amendment. The constitution originally included no term limit, but an amendment passed in 1992 allows governors to succeed themselves only once; before this, four governors were elected more than twice in a row. Gubernatorial terms begin on the first Monday in the January following the election. Governors who have served the two term limit can run again after four years out of office.

Arizona is one of the few states which does not have a lieutenant governor. Instead, in the event of a vacancy in the office of governor, the secretary of state, if elected, succeeds to the office. If the secretary of state was appointed rather than elected, or is otherwise ineligible to hold the office of governor, the next elected and eligible person in the line of succession assumes the office. The state constitution specifies the line of succession to be the Secretary of State, Attorney General, State Treasurer and Superintendent of Public Instruction, in that order. If the governor is out of the state or impeached, the next elected officer in the line of succession becomes acting governor until the governor returns or is cleared. In either case, any partial term counts toward the limit of two consecutive terms.

The line of succession has reached beyond the secretary of state only once, when Attorney General Bruce Babbitt became governor upon the death of Wesley Bolin. Rose Mofford had been appointed secretary of state to replace Bolin after Bolin succeeded to the governorship. Bolin had become governor when Raúl Héctor Castro resigned to accept appointment as ambassador to Argentina. Mofford later became acting governor after Evan Mecham was impeached by the House of Representatives, and succeeded to the governorship when Mecham was removed from office after his conviction by the Senate.

Starting with the 2026 election cycle, Arizona will have a lieutenant governor, pursuant to a 2022 amendment to the constitution. Nominees will be chosen by each party&#x27;s gubernatorial nominee, with the governor and lieutenant governor then chosen by general election voters on a joint ticket. If the offices of governor and the lieutenant governor become vacant at the same time, the amended law provisions of the state constitution are that the secretary of state, attorney general, state treasurer or the superintendent of public instruction will assume the office of governor and then appoint the lieutenant governor pending state legislative approval.

<doc id="233866" wikidata="Q777346" url="?curid=233866" title="List of governors of Arkansas">
<text>The governor of Arkansas is the head of government of the U.S. state of Arkansas. The governor is the head of the executive branch of the Arkansas government and is charged with enforcing state laws. They have the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Arkansas General Assembly, to convene the legislature, and to grant pardons, except in cases of treason and impeachment.

The state has had 46 elected governors, as well as 11 acting governors who assumed powers and duties following the resignation or death of the governor. Before becoming a state, Arkansas Territory had four governors appointed to it by the president of the United States. Orval Faubus (1955–1967) served the longest term as governor, being elected six times to serve 12 years. Bill Clinton (1979–1981; 1983–1992), elected five times over two distinct terms, fell only one month short of 12 years, and Mike Huckabee (1996–2007) served 10 years for two full four-year terms. The shortest term for an elected governor was the 38 days served by John Sebastian Little before his nervous breakdown; one of the acting successors to his term, Jesse M. Martin, took office only three days before the end of the term, the shortest term overall.

The current governor of Arkansas is Republican Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who was sworn in on January 10, 2023.

==List of governors==
===Arkansas Territory===
Arkansaw Territory (renamed Arkansas Territory, circa 1822) was split from the Missouri Territory on July 4, 1819. As territorial secretary from 1819 to 1829, Robert Crittenden served as acting governor whenever the appointed governor was not in the state. This meant that Crittenden was the first person to perform the duties of governor, since James Miller did not arrive in the territory until nine months after his appointment.


===State of Arkansas===
Arkansas was admitted to the Union on June 15, 1836. The state seceded on May 6, 1861, and was admitted to the Confederacy on May 18, 1861. When Little Rock, the state capital, was captured on September 10, 1863, the state government relocated to Washington, Arkansas, and a Union government was installed in its place, causing an overlap in the terms of Confederate governor Harris Flanagin and Union governor Isaac Murphy. During the post-war Reconstruction period, it was part of the Fourth Military District. Arkansas was readmitted to the Union on June 22, 1868.

The Arkansas Constitution of 1836 established four-year terms for governors, which was lowered to two years in the 1874, and current, constitution. An amendment in 1984 increased the terms of both governor and lieutenant governor to four years. Governors were originally limited only to serving no more than eight out of every twelve years, but the 1874 constitution removed any term limit. A referendum in 1992 limited governors to two terms.

Until 1864, the constitutions provided that, should the office of governor be rendered vacant, the president of the senate would serve as acting governor until such time as a new governor was elected or the disability removed, or the acting governor&#x27;s senate term expired. This led to some situations where the governorship changed hands in quick succession, due to senate terms ending or new senate presidents being elected. For example, after John Sebastian Little resigned in 1907, 3 senate presidents acted as governors before the next elected governor took office. Should the president of the senate be similarly incapacitated, the next in line for the governorship was the speaker of the state house of representatives.

The 1864 constitution created the office of lieutenant governor who would also act as president of the senate, and who would serve as acting governor in case of vacancy. The 1868 constitution maintained the position, but the 1874 constitution removed it and returned to the original line of succession. An amendment to the constitution, passed in 1914 but not recognized until 1925, recreated the office of lieutenant governor, who becomes governor in case of vacancy of the governor&#x27;s office. The governor and the lieutenant governor are not officially elected on the same ticket.

Arkansas was a strongly Democratic state before the Civil War, electing only candidates from the Democratic party. It elected three Republican governors following Reconstruction, but after the Democratic Party re-established control, 92 years passed before voters chose another Republican.

<text>Thomas Johannes Gottschalk (born 18 May 1950) is a German radio and television host and entertainer. He is best known for hosting &quot;Wetten, dass..?&quot;, for many years Europe&#x27;s biggest television show, which he steered to huge success in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and South Tyrol between 1987 and 2023. Until 2015, he was also the brand ambassador in television advertisements for Haribo confectionery.

==Early life==
Gottschalk was born in Bamberg, Bavaria, the son of a lawyer. After attending the &quot;Humanistisches Gymnasium&quot; (humanities-oriented high school) in Kulmbach, he studied history and German philology, eventually taking his exams as a teacher for primary and secondary schools; however, it was during this time that he discovered his true vocation: entertainment.

==Career==
From 1971 on, Gottschalk worked as a freelancer for the youth program of the Bayerischer Rundfunk (Bavarian Broadcasting); in 1973, he became anchor for a news program. In 1976, after a brief detour to the newspaper &quot;Münchner Merkur&quot;, he became a regular contributor at the Bayerischer Rundfunk, and subsequently gained popularity as the host of the show &quot;Pop nach acht&quot;. He was awarded the &quot;Kurt-Magnus-Preis&quot; for his &quot;outstanding talents&quot; as a radio host in 1978.

Starting in 1977, Gottschalk hosted the TV show &quot;Telespiele&quot;. Initially broadcast on the Bayerischer Rundfunk&#x27;s television channel, it switched to the national public ARD channel in 1980. In the same year, Gottschalk founded GLS United, the first German hip hop group and performed the first German rap song, &quot;Rapper&#x27;s Deutsch&quot;.

From 1982 to 1987, Gottschalk hosted the show &quot;Na sowas&quot; on ZDF and was awarded the Goldene Kamera (golden camera) for his performance on that show in 1985. During that period he also starred in several German comedies with actor Mike Krüger. Gottschalk occasionally works as an actor until today, taking roles in the Hollywood movies &quot;Trabbi goes to Hollywood&quot; (1991) and &quot;Zookeeper&quot; (2011). In 1993, Gottschalk starred in &quot;Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit&quot; (1993) as a consequence of leading actress Whoopi Goldberg losing a bet in Gottschalk&#x27;s gameshow &quot;Wetten, dass..?&quot;. He plays the sausage-obsessed German cook, Father Wolfgang.

In 1987, Gottschalk replaced Frank Elstner as host of &quot;Wetten, dass..?&quot;, which he continued until December 2011, with only a brief interruption from 1992 to 1994 when the show was taken over by Wolfgang Lippert. Reportedly, his withdrawal from the show was related to an accident that happened live on &quot;Wetten, dass..?&quot; on 4 December 2010. A contestant in the show, a young gymnast named Samuel Koch, was paralyzed from the shoulders down after being hit by a car during a stunt where he was to jump over it with spring-loaded boots. Gottschalk was upset this happened and called off the show early for the first time ever when it became apparent that Koch was severely injured. Gottschalk announced his retirement from the show in the next episode.
From 1992 to 1995, Gottschalk also hosted a late night show on television, &quot;Gottschalk Late Night&quot;, and while it was not very successful, it is considered a predecessor to such shows such as &quot;Die Harald Schmidt Show&quot;, &quot;TV total&quot; and the &quot;Johannes B. Kerner Show&quot;. &quot;Gottschalk Late Night&quot; also featured the &quot;Model &#x27;92&quot; Competition during 1992, in which Heidi Klum was the winner and received a modeling contract and winning prize, paving the way for her modeling career.

Gottschalk has been awarded a number of prizes for his work; apart from those mentioned above. These include the &quot;Telestar&quot; in 1987, the &quot;Goldenes Schlitzohr&quot; (golden rascal) and the &quot;Goldenes Kabel&quot; (golden cable) in 1991, as well as the &quot;Goldene Feder&quot; (&quot;golden feather&quot;) in 2001. He also received a total of three Bambi awards, which he returned in 1988 after a dispute with the publisher Burda. However, in 2001, he was awarded a &quot;Bambi of honor&quot; which he accepted. In 2012 Gottschalk co-hosted the show &quot;Das Supertalent&quot;.

Gottschalk also co-hosts the German TV show &quot;Die 2 – Gottschalk und Jauch gegen alle&quot; together with Günther Jauch.

==Personal life==
Gottschalk married his wife Thea in 1976. He has two sons, Roman and Tristan and one grandson (born 2010). In 2019, he announced that he and Thea would be getting divorced after 43 years of marriage.

On 16 November 2004, Gottschalk bought Castle Marienfels in Remagen, Germany. He lived there from 2006 to 2013. It was announced at the end of January 2013 that he had sold the castle to Frank Asbeck. He has had a second home in Malibu, California, since the beginning of the 1990s. The residence burned down in the 2018 California wildfires.

In 2005, Gottschalk received an entry in the Guinness World Records, having been featured in longest running ad featuring one person; between 1991 and 2015 he regularly appeared in ads for the sweets company Haribo.

On 20 November 2008, he won €1 million for charity in a celebrity version of &quot;Wer wird Millionär?&quot;, the German version of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;.

<doc id="233878" wikidata="Q162108" url="?curid=233878" title="Rubia">
<text>Rubia is the type genus of the Rubiaceae family of flowering plants, which also contains coffea (coffee). It contains around 80 species of perennial scrambling or climbing herbs and subshrubs native to the Old World. 

The genus and its best-known species are commonly known as madder, e.g. &quot;Rubia tinctorum&quot; (common madder), &quot;Rubia peregrina&quot; (wild madder), and &quot;Rubia cordifolia&quot; (Indian madder).

==Uses==

&quot;Rubia&quot; was an economically important source of a red pigment in many regions of Asia, Europe and Africa. The genus name &quot;Rubia&quot; derives from the Latin &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;red&quot;.

The plant&#x27;s roots contain an anthracene compound called alizarin that gives its red colour to a textile dye known as Rose madder. It was also used as a colourant, especially for paint, that is referred to as Madder lake. The synthesis of alizarin greatly reduced demand for the natural compound.

In Georgia, Rubia is used for dying Easter eggs red.

==History==
Several species, such as &quot;Rubia tinctorum&quot; in Europe, &quot;Rubia cordifolia&quot; in India, and &quot;Rubia argyi&quot; in East Asia, were extensively cultivated from antiquity until the mid nineteenth century for red dye, commonly called &quot;madder&quot;. Cloth dyed with it has been found on Egyptian mummies. It was the &quot;ereuthedanon&quot; () used for dyeing the cloaks of the Libyan women in the days of Herodotus. It is the &quot;erythrodanon&quot; () of Pedanius Dioscorides, who wrote of its cultivation in Caria, and of Hippocrates, and the &quot;Rubia&quot; of Pliny. &quot;R. tinctorum&quot; was extensively cultivated in south Europe, France, where it is called &quot;garance&quot;, and the Netherlands, and to a small extent in the United States. Large quantities were imported into England from Smyrna, Trieste, Livorno, etc. The cultivation, however, decreased after alizarin was made artificially.

Madder was employed medicinally in ancient civilizations and in the Middle Ages. In his &quot;Natural History&quot;, Pliny described it as a diuretic and is capable of treating jaundice and lichen planus. John Gerard, in 1597, wrote of it as having been cultivated in many gardens in his day, and describes its many supposed virtues, but any pharmacological or therapeutic action which madder may possess is unrecognizable. Its most remarkable physiological effect was found to be that of colouring red the bones of animals fed upon it, as also the claws and beaks of birds. This appears to be due to the chemical affinity of calcium phosphate for the colouring matter. This property was used to enable physiologists to ascertain the manner in which bones develop, and the functions of the various types of cell found in growing bone.

<text>Alizarin (also known as 1,2-dihydroxyanthraquinone, Mordant Red 11, C.I. 58000, and Turkey Red) is an organic compound with formula that has been used throughout history as a red dye, principally for dyeing textile fabrics. Historically it was derived from the roots of plants of the madder genus. In 1869, it became the first natural dye to be produced synthetically.

Alizarin is the main ingredient for the manufacture of the madder lake pigments known to painters as rose madder and alizarin crimson. Alizarin in the most common usage of the term has a deep red color, but the term is also part of the name for several related non-red dyes, such as Alizarine Cyanine Green and Alizarine Brilliant Blue. A use of alizarin in modern times is as a staining agent in biological research because it stains free calcium and certain calcium compounds a red or light purple color. Alizarin continues to be used commercially as a red textile dye, but to a lesser extent than in the past.

==History==
Madder has been cultivated as a dyestuff since antiquity in central Asia and Egypt, where it was grown as early as 1500 BC. Cloth dyed with madder root pigment was found in the tomb of the Pharaoh Tutankhamun, in the ruins of Pompeii, and ancient Athens and Corinth. In the Middle Ages, Charlemagne encouraged madder cultivation. Madder was widely used as a dye in Western Europe in the Late Medieval centuries. In 17th century England, alizarin was used as a red dye for the clothing of the parliamentary New Model Army. The distinctive red color would continue to be worn for centuries (though also produced by other dyes such as cochineal), giving English and later British soldiers the nickname of &quot;redcoats&quot;.

The madder dyestuff is combined with a dye mordant. Depending on which mordant is used, the resulting color may be anywhere from pink through purple to dark brown. In the 18th century, the most valued color was a bright red known as &quot;Turkey Red&quot;. The combination of mordants and overall technique used to obtain the Turkey Red originated in the Middle East or Turkey (hence the name). It was a complex and multi-step technique in its Middle Eastern formulation, some parts of which were unnecessary. The process was simplified in late 18th-century Europe. By 1804, dye maker George Field in Britain had refined a technique to make &quot;lake&quot; madder by treating it with alum, and an alkali, that converts the water-soluble madder extract into a solid, insoluble pigment. This resulting &quot;madder lake&quot; has a longer-lasting color, and can be used more efficaciously, for example by blending it into a paint. Over the following years, it was found that other metal salts, including those containing iron, tin, and chromium, could be used in place of alum to give madder-based pigments of various other colors. This general method of preparing lakes has been known for centuries but was simplified in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.

In 1826, the French chemist Pierre-Jean Robiquet found that madder root contained two colorants, the red alizarin and the more rapidly fading purpurin. The alizarin component became the first natural dye to be synthetically duplicated in 1868 when the German chemists Carl Graebe and Carl Liebermann, working for BASF, found a way to produce it from anthracene. The Bayer AG company draws its roots from alizarin as well. About the same time, the English dye chemist William Henry Perkin independently discovered the same synthesis, although the BASF group filed their patent before Perkin by one day. The subsequent discovery (made by Broenner and Gutzhow in 1871) that anthracene could be abstracted from coal tar further advanced the importance and affordability of alizarin&#x27;s artificial synthesis.

The synthetic alizarin could be produced for a fraction of the cost of the natural product, and the market for madder collapsed virtually overnight. The principal synthesis entailed bromination of anthraquinone by bromine (in a sealed tube at 100 oC) to give 1,2-dibromoanthraquinone. Then the two bromine atoms were substituted by -OH by heating (170 oC) with KOH, followed by treatment with strong acid. The incorporation of two bromine atoms in 1 and 2 position is not expected by an aromatic electrophilic substitution, and suggest the existence of an α,β unsaturated enol form of anthraquinone which suffer electrophilic addition by bromine. 

Alizarin, as a dye, has been largely replaced today by the more light-resistant quinacridone pigments developed at DuPont in 1958.

==Structure and properties==

Alizarin is one of ten dihydroxyanthraquinone isomers. It is soluble in hexane and chloroform, and can be obtained from the latter as red-purple crystals, melting point 277–278 °C.

Alizarin changes color depending on the pH of the solution it is in, thereby making it a pH indicator.

==Applications==
Alizarin Red is used in a biochemical assay to determine, quantitatively by colorimetry, the presence of calcific deposition by cells of an osteogenic lineage. As such it is an early stage marker (days 10–16 of in vitro culture) of matrix mineralization, a crucial step towards the formation of calcified extracellular matrix associated with true bone.

Alizarin&#x27;s abilities as a biological stain were first noted in 1567, when it was observed that when fed to animals, it stained their teeth and bones red. The chemical is now commonly used in medical studies involving calcium. Free (ionic) calcium forms precipitates with alizarin, and tissue block containing calcium stain red immediately when immersed in alizarin. Thus, both pure calcium and calcium in bones and other tissues can be stained. These alizarin-stained elements can be better visualized under fluorescent lights, excited by 440–460 nm. The process of staining calcium with alizarin works best when conducted in acidic solution (in many labs, it works better in pH 4.1 to 4.3).

In clinical practice, it is used to stain synovial fluid to assess for basic calcium phosphate crystals. Alizarin has also been used in studies involving bone growth, osteoporosis, bone marrow, calcium deposits in the vascular system, cellular signaling, gene expression, tissue engineering, and mesenchymal stem cells.

In geology, it is used as a stain to differentiate the calcium carbonate minerals, especially calcite and aragonite in thin section or polished surfaces.

Madder lake had been in use as a red pigment in paintings since antiquity.

<text>Ultra-high temperature processing (UHT), ultra-heat treatment, or ultra-pasteurization is a food processing technology that sterilizes liquid food by heating it above  – the temperature required to kill bacterial endospores – for two to five seconds. UHT is most commonly used in milk production, but the process is also used for fruit juices, cream, soy milk, yogurt, wine, soups, honey, and stews. UHT milk was first developed in the 1960s and became generally available for consumption in the 1970s.
The heat used during the UHT process can cause Maillard browning and change the taste and smell of dairy products. An alternative process is flash pasteurization, in which the milk is heated to for at least fifteen seconds.

UHT milk packaged in a sterile container has a typical unrefrigerated shelf life of six to nine months. In contrast, flash-pasteurized milk has a shelf life of about two weeks from processing, or about one week from being put on sale.

==History==
The most commonly applied technique to provide a safe and shelf-stable milk is heat treatment. The first system involving indirect heating with continuous flow ( for 6 min) was manufactured in 1893. In 1912, a continuous-flow, direct-heating method of mixing steam with milk at temperatures of was patented. However, without commercially available aseptic packaging systems to pack and store the product, such technology was not very useful in itself, and further development was stalled until the 1950s. In 1953, APV pioneered a steam injection technology, involving direct injection of steam through a specially designed nozzle which raises the product temperature instantly, under brand name Uperiser; milk was packaged in sterile cans. In the 1960s, APV launched the first commercial steam infusion system under the Palarisator brand name.
In 1952, in Sweden, Tetra Pak launched tetrahedral paperboard cartons. They made a commercial breakthrough in the 1960s, after technological advances, combining carton assembling and aseptic packaging technologies, followed by international expansion. In aseptic processing, the product and the package are sterilized separately and then combined and sealed in a sterile atmosphere, in contrast to canning, where product and package are first combined and then sterilized.

In 1983, the UK Parliament passed the Importation of Milk Act 1983, following a successful appeal to the European Court of Justice that prevented the government from banning the importation of UHT milk.

In June 1993, Parmalat introduced its UHT milk to the United States. In the American market, consumers are uneasy about consuming milk that is not delivered under refrigeration, making them reluctant to buy it. To combat this, Parmalat is selling its UHT milk in old-fashioned containers, unnecessarily sold from the refrigerator aisle. UHT milk is also used for many dairy products.

In 2008, the UK government proposed to produce nine units out of every ten as UHT by 2020, which they believed would significantly cut the need for refrigeration, and thus benefit the environment by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The milk industry opposed this, however, and the proposition was abandoned.

==Technology==
Ultra-high-temperature processing is performed in complex production plants, which perform several stages of food processing and packaging automatically and in succession:
* Flash heating
* Flash cooling
* Homogenization
* Aseptic packaging

In the heating stage, the treated liquid is first pre-heated to a noncritical temperature ( for milk), and then quickly heated to the temperature required by the process. There are two types of heating technologies: &quot;direct&quot;, where the product is put in a direct contact with the hot steam, and &quot;indirect&quot;, where the product and the heating medium remain separated by the equipment&#x27;s contact surfaces. The main goals of the design, both from product quality and from efficiency standpoints, are to maintain the high product temperature for the shortest period possible, and to ensure that the temperature is evenly distributed throughout.

===Direct heating systems===
Direct systems have the advantage that the product is held at a high temperature for a shorter period of time, thereby reducing the thermal damage for sensitive products such as milk. There are two groups of direct systems:
* Injection-based, where the high-pressure steam is injected into the liquid. It allows fast heating and cooling, but is only suitable for some products. As the product comes in contact with the hot nozzle, there is a possibility of local overheating.
* Infusion-based, where the liquid is pumped through a nozzle into a chamber with high-pressure steam at a relatively low concentration, providing a large surface contact area. This method achieves near-instantaneous heating and cooling and even distribution of temperature, avoiding local overheating. It is suitable for liquids of both low and high viscosity.

===Indirect heating systems===
In indirect systems, the product is heated by a solid heat exchanger similar to those used for pasteurization. However, as higher temperatures are applied, it is necessary to employ higher pressures in order to prevent boiling. There are three types of exchangers in use:
* Plate exchangers, 
* Tubular exchangers
* Scraped-surface exchangers.

For higher efficiency, pressurized water or steam is used as the medium for heating the exchangers themselves, accompanied with a regeneration unit which allows reuse of the medium and energy saving.

===Flash cooling===
After heating, the hot product is passed to a holding tube and then to a vacuum chamber, where it suddenly loses the temperature and vaporizes. The process, referred to as &quot;flash cooling&quot;, reduces the risk of thermal damage, inactivates thermophilic microbes due to abruptly falling temperatures, removes some or all of the excess water obtained through the contact with steam, and removes some of the volatile compounds which negatively affect product quality. The cooling rate and quantity of water removed is determined by the level of vacuum, which must be carefully calibrated.

===Homogenization===

Homogenization is part of the process specifically for milk. Homogenization is a mechanical treatment which results in a reduction of the size, and an increase in the number and total surface area, of fat globules in the milk. This reduces milk&#x27;s tendency to form cream at the surface, and on contact with containers enhances its stability and makes it more palatable for consumers.

==Worldwide use==

UHT milk has seen large success in much of Europe, where across the continent seven out of ten people consume it regularly. In countries with a warmer climate such as Spain, UHT milk is preferred due to the high cost of refrigerated transportation and &quot;inefficient cool cabinets&quot;. UHT is less popular in Northern Europe and Scandinavia, particularly in Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom and Ireland. It is also less popular in Greece, where fresh pasteurized milk is the most popular, due to legislation and societal attitudes.

While most regular milk sold in the United States is pasteurized, a significant share of organic milk sold in the US is UHT treated (organic milk is produced at fewer locations and consequently spends more time in the supply chain and could therefore spoil before or shortly after being sold if pasteurized).

==Effects on quality ==

=== Milk ===

UHT milk contains the same amount of calories and calcium as pasteurized milk. Some loss of vitamin B12, vitamin C (of which milk is not a significant source), and thiamin can occur in UHT milk. UHT milk contains of folate per , while pasteurized milk contains .

UHT milk&#x27;s protein structure is different from that of pasteurized milk, which prevents it from separating in cheese making.

Two studies published in the late 20th century showed that UHT treatment causes proteins contained in the milk to unfold and flatten, and the formerly &quot;buried&quot; sulfhydryl (SH) groups, which are normally masked in the natural protein, cause extremely-cooked or burnt flavours to be sensed by the human palate. One study reduced the thiol content by immobilizing sulfhydryl oxidase in UHT-heated skim milk and reported, after enzymatic oxidation, an improved flavor. Two US authors prior to heating added the flavonoid compound epicatechin to the milk, and reported a partial reduction of thermally generated aromas.

<doc id="233885" wikidata="Q28791821" url="?curid=233885" title="List of academic ranks">
<text>Academic rank (also scientific rank) is the rank of a scientist or teacher in a college, high school, university or research establishment. The academic ranks indicate relative importance and power of individuals in academia.
The academic ranks are &quot;specific for each country&quot;, there is no worldwide-unified ranking system. Among the common ranks are professor, associate professor (docent), assistant professor and lecturer/instructor.
In most cases, the academic rank is automatically attached to a person at the time of employment in a position with the same name, and deprived when a working relationship ends. Thus, the term &quot;academic rank&quot; usually means the same as &quot;position in academia&quot;.
In some countries, however, the terms &quot;position&quot; and &quot;academic rank&quot; are not synonymous. So in modern Russia there exist the docent and professor ranks, yet the set of positions in academia is broader. The academic rank is conferred only after the person has been successfully working in the docent or professor position for a certain period (and later underwent a centralized control procedure), i.e. not at enrollment, and is kept for life.

The list of academic ranks below identifies the hierarchical ranking structure found amongst scholars and personnel in academia. The lists below refer specifically to colleges and universities throughout the world, although other institutions of higher learning may follow a similar schema.

* Level B – Lecturer, or Research Fellow if research intensive; Level B is the first tenured academic rank, normally requires at minimum, completion of a PhD.
* Level A - Associate Lecturer, or Associate Fellow if research intensive.

There are often multiple bands or steps for each Level (e.g. Level B - 6 steps, Level C - 6 steps, Level D - 4 steps). For example, an academic who earns the title of Level D has progressed through 12 bands/steps of previous academic service or the equivalent in accumulated academic achievements. There is only one step for Level E. An academic cannot automatically progress from Level B, Step 6, to Level C, Step 1, without a formal application for promotion, which is typically a peer reviewed process.

==Bangladesh==
Teachers are categorized in four main classes in Bangladesh at the university level. The ascending ranks of teachers are lecturer, assistant professor, associate professor and professor. University lecturers are normally required to hold a master&#x27;s degree. After obtaining a PhD, the appointment starts with assistant professor, then gradually associate professor and professor depending on research/teaching experience. Beside these, the title of emeritus is given to extraordinary professors after their retirement.

==Chile==

In Chile there is no general law that establishes the academic ranges, although the following are normally used: Profesor Titular (full professor), Profesor Asociado (associate professor), Profesor Asistente (assistant professor), and Instructor. 

The University of Chile, the oldest university in the country, distinguishes three academic categories: Ordinary Category, Teaching Category, Adjunct Category, and Postdoctoral Researcher. &quot;Each category has its own academic ranks. Academics in the Ordinary Academic Category must carry out higher education and research or artistic creation&quot;. &quot;Academics in the Academic Teaching Category must perform superior teaching, supported by outstanding professional work in the field of their academic work&quot;. &quot;Academics in the Adjunct Academic Category must perform superior teaching, or scientific research, or artistic creation, or extension&quot;. &quot;They must also demonstrate outstanding academic or professional work in the field of their discipline&quot;. In addition, there are three academic statuses: Profesor emérito, Profesor honorario de Facultad o Instituto y Profesor visitante.

The Ordinary Academic Career and the Academic Teaching Career have the following ranks: 
* Profesor titular (A tenured, full professor position. It is the highest academic rank of the University). 
*Profesor asociado (A tenured, associate professor position).
*Profesor asistente
* Instructor

The rank of Instructor &quot;correspond to a stage of training and improvement, and verification of aptitudes for the university task&quot;. The ranks of Profesor Asistente, Profesor Asociado, y Profesor Titular &quot;correspond to academics fully trained for the university task, with the capacity to perform it in a creative and suitable way, with varying degrees of autonomy according to the level&quot;. The ranks of profesor asociado y profesor titular are decided by the University&#x27;s senior evaluation committee. The other ranks are decided by commissions of each faculty.

The Adjunct category has only the rank of Associate Professor. The Postdoctoral Researcher category has no other rank.

The Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile has the same three hierarchies of Profesor Titular, Profesor Asociado and Profesor Asistente for the ordinary academic category. It also recognizes five adjunct academic categories: Profesor adjunto, Instructor adjunto, Investigador adjunto, Investigador postdoctoral y Profesor visitante.

==Egypt==
Teachers are categorized in five main classes in Egypt at university level. The ascending rank of teacher is demonstrator, assistant lecturer, lecturer, assistant professor and professor. The initial position, demonstrator, is generally enrolled as the top student of the class. Master&#x27;s degree is required for university-level assistant lecturer. After PhD, the appointment starts with lecturer, then gradually associate professor and professor, depending on research/teaching experience. Beside these, professor of emeritus is given to extraordinary professor after their retirement.

==Finland==

In Finland, there is less distinction between graduates and undergraduates: university students may be employed as research assistants (&quot;tutkimusapulainen&quot;) before they graduate with a master&#x27;s degree. A person pursuing a doctoral degree must already hold a Master&#x27;s degree, and is typically employed by the university, or enjoys a similar grant, and will be called &quot;väitöskirjatutkija&quot; (doctoral researcher), &quot;nuorempi tutkija&quot; (early career researcher), or &quot;tohtorikoulutettava&quot; (doctoral student). Besides post-doctoral researchers (&quot;tutkijatohtori&quot;) and senior teaching assistants (&quot;yliassistentti&quot;), there are several mid-level non-professorial positions, such as teaching researcher (&quot;opettava tutkija&quot;). Senior teachers and researchers may be employed as, e.g., &quot;erikoistutkija&quot; (special researcher) or &quot;yliopistotutkija&quot; (senior research fellow). Docent (&quot;dosentti&quot;) is a non-professorial rank and title (for life) awarded to academics qualified as a principal investigator and for supervision of doctoral students; however, they do not belong to the professor corps and may be employed elsewhere. Professors (&quot;professori&quot;) are understood as research group leaders and managers, and traditionally there is no direct equivalent of an assistant/associate/full professor career path, although Aalto University is introducing these. Qualifications for a professor&#x27;s position are earned as a docent or in other mid-career positions. In management, professors serve as department heads (&quot;laitosjohtaja&quot; or &quot;osastonjohtaja&quot;) and deans (head of the faculty, &quot;dekaani&quot;). The leader of a university is called a rector (&quot;rehtori&quot;), assisted by multiple vice-rectors (&quot;vararehtori&quot;). Vice-rectors may retain their professor positions or work full-time as a vice-rector. Some universities have an even more senior officer called Chancellor (&quot;kansleri&quot;), who is more concerned with outreach and public relations than daily management.

==France==


In French business schools, ranks are the same as in the United States: assistant professor, associate professor, and finally (full) professor.

==Hong Kong==

In the past, Hong Kong followed the British system (4 levels). In recent years it is moving towards the North American counterpart, with the titles renamed to their corresponding equivalence (professor (professor), associate professor (professor/reader), and assistant professor (senior-)lecturer)). Hong Kong&#x27;s universities usually differ between professorial grades (end- or mid-career research and teaching positions) and lecturers (entry or mid-career positions - in the UK called either teaching fellows or lecturers, and &quot;Mittelbau&quot; in German-speaking countries). Depending on institutions, the title of &quot;professor&quot; is assumed by chair professors and professors, or assistant professors and above.

==Iceland==
In Icelandic universities, particularly at the University of Iceland, &quot;prófessor&quot; is the most senior ranking teaching position. Below &quot;prófessor&quot; is &quot;dósent&quot;, then &quot;lektor&quot;. This three step hierarchy is akin to the US-scale, of full-, associate- and assistant-professors. Until the early 1990s no upward mobility was available in the Icelandic system. Most university teachers were hired as &quot;prófessor.&quot; A &quot;dósent&quot; or a &quot;lektor&quot; wishing to ascend to a higher rank had to apply for a new position when it became available. Currently (since the 1990s) much more university teachers are hired as junior rank &quot;lektor&quot; and are promoted to &quot;dósent&quot; and &quot;prófessor&quot; if their work proves worthy of it.

==India==
Regular Academic ranks (Hierarchy from top): Academic institutions in India have the mandate of teaching, training and research. This also includes research universities.
# Professor
# Associate Professor
# Assistant Professor
# In addition to these, there are government sponsored fellowships awarded to able candidates for a 5-year contract period during which they are hosted by an academic or research organisation. Their primary function is to carry out high quality original research. They may become a regular faculty as an assistant professor or associate professor during this period subject to their performance.
# Assistant Professor (on contract) / Ad hoc faculty – They are primarily involved in teaching for a limited contract period typically 6 months – 1 year. 
Research ranks (Hierarchy from top): Research institutions such as national labs have a different kind of hierarchy and are primarily concerned with basic and applied research. They guide Ph.D. students in their research thesis but do not grant degrees. In most cases the Ph.D. candidates are registered with another university which grants the degree. Awarding of degree is subjected to meeting the same criteria as Ph.D. guided by university professors.

* - Professor emeritus
* - (Full) Professor
* - Associate professor
* - Lecturer / Junior associate professor / Assistant professor
* - Assistant professor

Unlike the other ranks, the &quot;kōshi&quot; title has no official criteria and thus no standardized English translation. Historically many Japanese associate professors had only master&#x27;s degrees, but this is no longer the case for younger generations of academics, who in such cases are now limited to the rank of &quot;kōshi&quot;. There were previously other ranks similar to associate professor and postdoctoral researcher called and respectively, but these positions have been eliminated.

The Japanese system includes non-tenured, term-limited positions at all ranks, including professor. These are referred to as positions and include in the official title when contracts are awarded on a rolling, one-year basis. Limited tenure track positions have recently been introduced.

Granting of tenure and promotion to associate professor are not linked; one may be tenured yet remain an assistant professor or promoted to associate professor before being awarded tenure. Because the number of professor and associate professor position is nearly fixed, direct promotion usually requires a higher-level post to be vacated.

* Professor
* Associate Professor
* Senior Lecturer
* Lecturer

==Malta==

==Mexico==
The ranking system in most Mexican public universities is as follows
* A (early assistant professor)
* B (assistant professor)
* C (early associate professor)
* A (associate professor)
* B (full professor)
* C (senior full professor)
* (equivalent to distinguished professor, not to be confused with emeritus professor)
Usually Mexican academics are also fellows of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (SNI) that has four levels (candidate, I, II and III) that more or less correlate (but are not equivalent) to the Asociado and Titular A, B, and C professorships. The rank as professor is determined by the individual&#x27;s institution while the SNI level is determined by an independent committee that evaluates the researchers nationwide.

Many universities and research institutions make a distinction between &quot;Profesores&quot; -Professors- and &quot;Investigadores&quot; -Researchers- (Asociado A, B, C, Titular A, B, C), the main difference is that &quot;Profesores&quot; have a higher load of teaching, while &quot;Investigadores&quot; have a higher load of research, but normally all of them take part in both activities and are considered equivalent.

Research rankings are awarded by the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores which depends on the national research council (Conacyt):
* SNI emeritus researcher (not necessarily higher rank but lifetime, requires 15 continuous years as SNI III)
* SNI III researcher (about 7% of the researchers in SNI)
* SNI II researcher (about 16% of the researchers in SNI)
* SNI I researcher (about 59% of researchers in SNI)
* SNI candidate researcher (C) (about 18% of researchers in SNI)

All titles, both professors and researchers, can be given in a:
* Full-time, or
* Part-time basis

Administrative academic positions:
* Rector or Presidente (Chancellor, Chief Executive Officer)
* Secretario Académico (Provost, Chief Academic Officer)

==Pakistan==
The hiring of academic positions in public universities throughout Pakistan is managed by the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan, the requirement for all positions vary with respect to the field of studies e.g. Engineering, IT, Medical, Law, and Arts and Design.

There are four faculty ranks: lecturer, assistant professor, associate professor, and professor.

In engineering public universities, a lecturer requires an M.Sc. or B.Sc. degree and high academic standing in the field (e.g. gold medalist, among top 15 students of graduating class).
An assistant professor position requires a Ph.D. in relevant field with no experience.
An associate professorship can be conducted in the fourth year of employment, although, it is becoming more common for promotion and tenure to be awarded in the sixth year of employment.

A professor requires ten years post-PhD teaching/research experience in an HEC recognized university or a post-graduate institution or professional experience in the relevant field in a national or international organization. It requires a minimum of 8/12/15 research publications (with at least 2/3/5 publications in the last 5 years) by the calendar years 2007/2008/2012 respectively, in HEC/PEC recognized journals

==Peru==

After some recent reforms in the University Law (Minedu, 2014), the Peruvian universities (publics and privates) consider these ranks:

Extraordinary Professors: Principally, this is a category of recognition for his contribution as professor or researcher when he retires or as a professional when he has built a great contribution to society throughout his career. To have 10% as maximum of these professors in any university (public or private) is mandatory.

* - For this recognition, the candidate should be faculty member (former ordinary professor in retiring process).
* Honorary professor - For this recognition, the candidate is not related to a faculty member. For instance, in this category is the Doctor Honoris Causa.

Research Professors: Principally, full-time research position with few teaching responsibilities. Research professorships are almost always funded by grants or fellowships apart from the regular university budget. He is designated because of its academic excellence. He has a special bonus of fifty percent (50%) of its total payments. The competent authority of each university evaluates every two years, the production of the ordinary professors, for their permanence as a researcher.

Ordinary Professors: Often full-time (with exclusivity) professors with research competences. Principal faculty. To have 25% as minimum of these professors in any university (public or private) is mandatory.

* Full professor - PhD and MSc required, and former Associate professor or 15 years of experience (minimum) as researcher in the field to apply.
* Associate professor - PhD (postgraduate level) and MSc required, and former Assistant professor or 10 years of experience (minimum) as researcher in the field to apply.
* Assistant professor - PhD (postgraduate level) and MSc required, and 5 years of experience (minimum) as researcher in the field to apply.

Lecturer (Hired Professors): Often part-time (with non-exclusivity) professors. Complementary faculty. Generally, their primary employer is not the university with which they have the status. Principally, this kind of professor come from practitioner market and not develop research activities. MSc required.

In addition, the universities developed prior ranks, as junior temporary rank, to get experience and training (with strong motivation to be ordinary professor):

* Instructor (Instructor, Jefe de Práctica) - MSc required in Postgraduate level and BSc required in Undergraduate level. 
* Teaching/Research Assistant - MSc required in Postgraduate level and BSc required in Undergraduate level.

<doc id="233887" wikidata="Q660131" url="?curid=233887" title="USS Green Bay (LPD-20)">
<text>USS &quot;Green Bay&quot; (LPD-20) is a . She is the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the city and bay of Green Bay, Wisconsin.

The contract to build her was awarded to Northrop Grumman Ship Systems of New Orleans, Louisiana, on 30 May 2000 and her keel was laid down on 11 August 2003. &quot;Green Bay&quot; was christened on 15 July 2006 and commissioned on 24 January 2009. Rose Magnus, the wife of Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps General Robert Magnus, served as the ship&#x27;s sponsor. &quot;Green Bay&quot; is assigned to the U.S. Pacific Fleet, and her home port was Naval Base San Diego, until 2015 when she was forward deployed to United States Fleet Activities Sasebo in Sasebo, Nagasaki, Japan.

The ship&#x27;s name has resulted in a close connection to the people of Green Bay, Wisconsin, and their professional football team, the Green Bay Packers. The ship&#x27;s flight deck is named &quot;Lambeau Field&quot; after the name of the Packers&#x27; stadium. Green Bay businesses and residents presented the ship with a truckload of Packerland memorabilia for her 2009 commissioning.

==AV-8B Harrier testing==
In 2009, Air Test and Evaluation Squadron 31 (VX-31) and &quot;Green Bay&quot; tested the feasibility of using the &quot;San Antonio&quot;-class LPDs for AV-8B Harrier IIs V/STOL attack aircraft in emergency situations. The AV-8Bs were used in numerous tests for the &quot;San Antonio&quot;-class&#x27;s aviation certification, as well testing the effect of exhaust heat on the flight deck.

==Service history==
The ship went on her first deployment in February 2011 with the three-ship Amphibious Ready Group. The group, comprising 4,000 sailors and Marines from the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit, deployed for seven months to the United States Fifth and Seventh Fleet areas in the Asian region.

In March 2011, &quot;Green Bay&quot; was scheduled to assisted in Operation Tomodachi, the relief efforts after the massive 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami struck Japan. She was instead rerouted into Operation Enduring Freedom areas and never made it to Japan.

In May 2013, &quot;Green Bay&quot; returned from an eight-month deployment to the Middle East and Asia as part of the Amphibious Ready Group, along with the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit.

In January 2015, &quot;Green Bay&quot; was forward deployed to the 7th Fleet replacing in the Amphibious Ready Group homeported at United States Fleet Activities Sasebo.

On 5 August 2017, a U.S. Marine Corps MV-22 Osprey struck &quot;Green Bay&quot; after taking off from USS &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot;. The aircraft then crashed in Shoalwater Bay on the east coast of Australia. 23 personnel were rescued, with three confirmed dead.

In May 2022, &quot;Green Bay&quot; was a part of the Amphibious Ready Group in Sasebo.

On December 9, 2024, &quot;Green Bay&quot; was reassigned San Diego for its new homeport. This shift complies with the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), requiring that U.S. Navy ships not be permanently forward deployed to Japan for more than 10 years.

<text>USS &quot;San Antonio&quot; (LPD-17), the lead ship of her class of amphibious transport dock or landing platform dock, is the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the city of San Antonio, Texas.

==Construction==
===Design improvements===

&quot;San Antonio&quot; is the first U.S. Navy vessel to incorporate new crew comfort features, including bunks with increased headroom, in-rack fans, and pull-out laptop computer shelves.

She is also the largest U.S. Navy vessel to incorporate stealth features, with close attention paid to exterior shaping. Shaping features include:
* Major antennas are mounted on platforms inside two Advanced Enclosed Mast/Sensor systems rather than on traditional mast yardarms that expose antennas to the environment.
* Deck edges are bounded by shaped bulwarks rather than lifeline stanchions. These bulwarks are hollow and double as storage lockers, eliminating locker clutter on decks.
* Exterior equipment is recessed or flush-mounted where possible, giving the ship a clean exterior appearance. Any equipment that cannot be flush-mounted (such as ladders) incorporate shaping features of their own.
* The boat-handling crane at the center of the ship folds into a clean shape when not in use.
* The anchor and anchor pocket are shaped to minimize radar backscatter.

===Contract award and build===
On 17 December 1996, the U.S. Navy awarded a contract to an industrial alliance led by Northrop Grumman Ship Systems (formerly Litton Avondale), with General Dynamics Bath Iron Works, Raytheon Electronic Systems and Intergraph Corporation, to design and construct the first of an anticipated 12 ships under the Navy&#x27;s LPD-17 program.

The keel was laid down on 9 December 2000. The ship was launched on 12 July 2003 and christened on 19 July by Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas. She was originally scheduled to be commissioned 17 July 2002, but was delayed by problems at the Avondale shipyard, which resulted in her being towed from New Orleans to the Northrop Grumman shipyard at Pascagoula, Mississippi, in December 2004 for completion.

The Navy took delivery three days before Hurricane Katrina hit in August 2005. Work was delayed further when the ship became a base for regional relief efforts, including accommodations for some shipyard workers, the National Guard, Navy diving and salvage personnel and government officials. The ship&#x27;s final cost was $840 million over budget.

===Commissioning===
She was finally commissioned 14 January 2006, at NS Ingleside, Texas. Guest speakers included former U.S. President George H. W. Bush. Senator Hutchison, the ship&#x27;s sponsor, gave the crew the customary first command, &quot;Man our ship, and bring her to life!&quot; After commissioning she was sent to her home port of Norfolk, Virginia.

==Ship history==
===2003===
USS San Antonio was built by Northrop Grumman Ship Systems in New Orleans, the 684-foot, 25,000-ton vessel was launched on 12 July 2003, and christened one week later. It had been scheduled to be commissioned on 17 July 2002, but was delayed by poor performance at the Avondale shipyard, which resulted in it being towed from New Orleans to the Northrop Grumman shipyard at Pascagoula, Miss., in December 2004 for completion. The ship was unable to move under its own power at that time, despite having been christened more than a year earlier.

===2009===
In 2009, &quot;San Antonio&quot; served as a flagship for Combined Task Force 151, the multi-national anti-piracy naval force off Somalia. During the ship&#x27;s time off Africa, the crew boarded 20 foreign vessels. The crew discovered hidden explosives on one of the vessels. The ship returned to Norfolk on 27 March 2009.

===2013===
In August 2013, the Navy confirmed that &quot;San Antonio&quot; had entered into the eastern Mediterranean Sea. They stressed it was a long-planned action and not related to the arrival of destroyers which had been stationed there due to the conflict in Syria. Officials thought it prudent to keep the ship near the destroyers, given the situation. In October 2013, Al Qaeda operative Abu Anas al-Libi was seized in Libya and then transferred to &quot;San Antonio&quot; to await transport to the United States for a trial and questioning.

===2016===
On 12 October 2016, &quot;San Antonio&quot; and destroyer were transiting through the southern end of the Red Sea when missiles were fired at them from Houthi-controlled territory in Yemen. Neither ship was harmed. In response to the attack on &quot;Mason&quot; and &quot;San Antonio&quot;, the destroyer launched five cruise missiles against three radar sites in Yemen that U.S. officials believe targeted the U.S. ships.

On 21 October 2016, &quot;San Antonio&quot; deployed to the Mediterranean Sea as part of Operation Odyssey Lightning to replace amphibious assault ship , which was carrying out operations against ISIS. &quot;San Antonio&quot; carried UH-1 Y Hueys and AH-1 W Cobras from the 22nd MEU&#x27;s Aviation Combat Unit, VMM-264; Marine Harrier fighters were part of the operation aboard &quot;Wasp.&quot;

==Criticism==
Nearly three years after commissioning, problems persisted with this first-in-class vessel. On 27 January 2006, a contract worth over $6 million was awarded to Northrop Grumman, for the Post-Shakedown Availability of &quot;San Antonio&quot;. Work was expected to be completed by April 2007. On 22 June 2007, Secretary of the Navy Donald C. Winter sent a letter to Northrop Grumman outlining problems with the ship, from leaks to steerage issues, stating, &quot;Twenty-three months after commissioning of LPD-17, the Navy still does not have a mission-capable ship.&quot;

One week prior to deployment refrigerated storage went down. Refrigerated units were craned onto the flight deck to store deployment provisions while repairs were conducted. On the day of deployment the stern gate failed to function causing a delay of two days.

In November 2008, two months into her maiden deployment, &quot;San Antonio&quot; had been forced to undergo an unplanned maintenance stop in Bahrain due to leaks in its lube oil piping system.

During a February 2009 transit of the Suez Canal, with both shafts at full power, one shaft suddenly went into reverse, sending the vessel careening out of control and narrowly missing other ships and running aground.

During an anti-piracy mission in February 2009, one of the ship&#x27;s crew, Petty Officer 1st Class Theophilus K. Ansong, 34, of Bristol, Virginia, was killed in a small boat accident in the Gulf of Aden. The ship&#x27;s captain, Commander Eric C. Cash, was reprimanded over the incident at an admiral&#x27;s mast by Admiral J.C. Harvey Jr., the commander of Fleet Forces Command. Another officer, Lieutenant Commander Sean Kearns, the ship&#x27;s executive officer, refused a mast over the same incident and was court-martialed in October and November 2010. During the trial, his defense team presented evidence of the ship&#x27;s numerous deficiencies and lack of written procedures as contributing to the accident. Kearns was acquitted of the charges on 5 November 2010. Kearns stated that the ship&#x27;s officers had been pressured by the Navy to declare the ship ready to deploy even though they knew that it still had significant, unresolved problems.

In response to these problems the Navy finally obtained approval to hire a sufficient number Supervisor of Shipbuilding officers in 2009.

In October 2010, the Department of Defense released a report outlining numerous engineering flaws in &quot;San Antonio&quot;. A top aide in the Department of Defense was quoted as saying that Northrop Grumman&#x27;s ships are &quot;not effective, suitable and not survivable in combat&quot;. The report also blamed Raytheon, a subcontractor providing fiber optics, electrical and anti-missile systems for &quot;San Antonio&quot;, for &quot;persistent engineering deficiencies.&quot;

In April 2011 after nearly two years of constant repair work at various shipyards in Norfolk, Virginia, the Navy started an investigation into the constant mechanical and engineering issues with &quot;San Antonio&quot;. The executive director of the Regional Maintenance Activity (RMC), Thomas J. Murphy, managing the work was relieved and transferred, as were the senior Waterfront Operations personnel. The Navy said that two contractors, Earl Industries, the prime contractor, and Fairbanks Morse, the engine manufacturer, were unwilling or unable to provide complete documentation into what was fixed on the ship and how. As a result, the Navy suspended Norfolk Ship Support Activity&#x27;s oversight authority.

On 6 May 2011, the Navy canceled its maintenance contract with Earl Industries, citing, &quot;improper work performed and concern regarding Earl Industries&#x27; quality assurance program and the company&#x27;s ability to control the quality and documentation of work it performs.&quot;

On 26 May 2011, after 10 days of sea trials, the ship&#x27;s power plants were declared fit for duty. The ship completed the trials on 15 June 2011 and was scheduled for a short training deployment from July to August 2011. In July 2011 &quot;San Antonio&quot;″s diesel engine&#x27;s intercoolers were found to be mechanically deficient after the ship failed to gain full power causing the ship to return to be repaired. The repairs also found deficiencies in work performed by Earl Industries. The repairs were completed on 3 August 2011.

As of August 2011, the Navy now says that all problems with the ship&#x27;s engines have been corrected including &quot;foreign material exclusion plugs left in the drain piping system, use of incorrect material and improper installation and sealing of gaskets&quot;.

==Awards==
*2012 Battle Effectiveness award.

==Ship&#x27;s coat of arms==

The colors of the shield and star are adapted from the Texan state flag. The star also commemorates the &quot;Lone Star&quot; and first United States Navy ship to bear the name San Antonio. Red is the color for valor and sacrifice, blue is for loyalty and white, purity of purpose. The Alamo honors the men who were killed fighting for the independence of Texas from Mexico. The bluebonnets refer to the beauty and majesty of Texas and the olive branch highlights the ship&#x27;s peacekeeping mission. The trident and cannon represent the old and new weaponry. The cannonballs and nineteenth century cannon were similar weapons used by the brave men that defended the Alamo. The trident, symbol of sea prowess, also represents the &quot;mobility triad&quot; that USS &quot;San Antonio&quot; is built for. The crossed Navy and Marine Corps swords represent cooperation and teamwork of the United States Navy and the United States Marine Corps.

<text>USS &quot;New Orleans&quot; (LPD-18), a , is the fourth commissioned ship of the United States Navy to be named after the city of New Orleans, Louisiana.

==History==
===Construction===
The contract to build her was awarded on 18 December 1998 to Northrop Grumman Ship Systems of New Orleans, Louisiana, and her keel was laid down on 14 October 2002. The ship was christened on 20 November 2004, sponsored by Carolyn Shelton, the wife of General Henry H. Shelton, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The ship was launched three weeks later, on 11 December. The ship completed her builder&#x27;s trials on 26 October 2006.

===Commissioning===
&quot;New Orleans&quot; was commissioned on 10 March 2007 in New Orleans, Louisiana. After commissioning, she steamed to San Diego, California via the Panama Canal to join the U.S. Pacific Fleet. The ship arrived at her new homeport of Naval Base San Diego on 3 May 2007 and was assigned to Amphibious Squadron Five.

===Fielding and issues===
After arriving in San Diego, &quot;New Orleans&quot; required 400,000 more man-hours of construction to bring her to fully operational status. In August 2008, the ship failed her INSURV inspection. The INSURV inspectors documented 2,600 deficiencies, including problems with the steering system, broken ventilation fans, inoperable elevators, corrosion on the flight deck, and an unreliable propulsion system. &quot;USS &quot;New Orleans&quot; was degraded in her ability to conduct sustained combat operations,&quot; the INSURV report said. US Navy officials reported that 85% of the deficiencies were minor issues and that most of the deficiencies had already been corrected.

On 9 January 2009, &quot;New Orleans&quot; departed San Diego on her initial deployment, as part of a five-ship expeditionary strike group (ESG) that also included and . The &quot;Boxer&quot; ESG and the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit included more than 4,000 sailors and marines.

=== Collision with USS &quot;Hartford&quot; ===

On 20 March 2009 &quot;New Orleans&quot; was involved in a collision with the attack submarine in the Strait of Hormuz. Fifteen sailors on &quot;Hartford&quot; suffered minor injuries and the fuel tank on &quot;New Orleans&quot; was ruptured causing an oil spill of 25,000 gallons of diesel marine fuel. After the incident both vessels were able to continue under their own power.

===Southern Partnership Station 2010 Deployment===
After proving herself mission ready and fully recovered from 2009&#x27;s collision with USS &quot;Hartford&quot;, &quot;New Orleans&quot; took part in Exercise Dawn Blitz. The joint exercise between 3rd Fleet and 1st Marine Expeditionary Force provided a training opportunity for 8,000 Sailors and Marines aboard 8 participating ships to practice amphibious assault and Blue/Green coordination in preparation for deployment.

From June through September, &quot;New Orleans&quot; deployed for the Southern Partnership Station 2010 to conduct combined maritime operations with Partner Nation navies in conjunction with multinational amphibious exercises. Embarked partner navies from across the world experienced some of the newest navy technology and the finest tactical and nautical expertise.

During her 2010 deployment, &quot;New Orleans&quot; conducted counter narcotics operations and made port visits to Manzillo, Mexico; Callao, Peru; and Balboa, Panama. In each port, &quot;New Orleans&quot; volunteered in community relations (COMREL) projects at orphanages and small villages. &quot;New Orleans&quot; crew dutifully represented the U.S. by upholding high standards of conduct and community service, and embarked members of the Mexican, Peruvian, Argentinean, Brazilian, Colombian, and Uruguay Navies were impressed by the professionalism and capability of the U.S. military.

===First LPD-17 Class to Undergo Deperming===
On 11 July 2011, &quot;New Orleans&quot; pulled into Point Loma&#x27;s deperming slip, becoming the first of her class to undergo deperming. The evolution required 6 days and 96 cables wrapped around the ship by hand. By running electrical current through the cables, she reduced her magnetic signature to minimize vulnerability to mines. Upon completion, she passed through a degaussing range 14 times, displaying a magnetic signature less than that of most destroyers.

===2011 Fifth Fleet Deployment===
&quot;New Orleans&quot; departed on 14 November 2011, for her third deployment. En route to 5th Fleet, she visited Cambodia to train with their navy. Both nations participated in joint man overboard drills as well as visit, board, search, and seizure (VBSS) exercises. She also pulled into Changi, Singapore, before chopping into 5th Fleet.
Upon arrival in 5th Fleet, &quot;New Orleans&quot; was selected as the U.A.E. Ambassador&#x27;s venue for his reception, hosting 300 international delegates in Abu Dhabi. She received accolades from ESG-5 for the successful execution of the event.

===2015 Exercises===
In September, &quot;New Orleans&quot; joined other BOXARG units in support of Dawn Blitz 2015. This multi-national amphibious exercise showcased the tremendous capabilities of amphibious power projection.

She commenced her Composite Training Unit Exercise (COMPTUEX) in October. BOXARG COMPTUEX was designed to be the most challenging live scenario training event for an ARG/MEU to date, exercising all warfare areas to include amphibious warfare, surface warfare, air warfare, and command and control.

&quot;New Orleans&quot; got underway again in December to earn her certification for deployment. During the final days of the Certification Exercise (CERTEX), an MV-22 assigned to USS &quot;Boxer&quot; suffered a mishap on short approach to &quot;New Orleans&quot; during a routine passenger movement. &quot;New Orleans&quot;’ crew stabilized the aircraft, safely disembarked the passengers and flight crew, and then made preparations for an unplanned pier-side movement to Naval Station North Island in order to safely crane the stricken aircraft off the flight deck. Upon removing the aircraft, &quot;New Orleans&quot; got back underway for a successful completion of CERTEX.

===2016 WESTPAC Deployment===
On 12 February 2016, &quot;New Orleans&quot; departed San Diego for a seven-month deployment and embarked Marines from 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), sailors from Assault Craft Unit (ACU) 1, Assault Craft Unit (ACU) 5 and Beach Master Unit (BMU) 1 as part of the Boxer Amphibious Ready Group (ARG), comprising USS &quot;New Orleans&quot; (LPD-18), USS &quot;Boxer&quot; (LHD-4) and USS &quot;Harpers Ferry&quot; (LSD-49). The first stop on deployment was in Hawaii where &quot;New Orleans&quot; conducted four days of amphibious operations bringing thousands of Marines to the beach via MV-22 Ospreys and landing craft air cushions (LCAC) for extensive sustainment training.

On 8 March 2016, USS &quot;New Orleans&quot; participated in the Ssang Yong exercise. Ssang Yong was a multinational exercise with Republic of Korea Navy and Marine Corps, Australian Army, US Navy, and New Zealand Army forces that performed a variety of military operations from disaster relief to expeditionary operations.

The next mission for &quot;New Orleans&quot; was supporting coalition operations in Fifth Fleet and conducting maritime security operations in the Gulf of Aden. On 6 May 2016, it was reported that the U.S. staged the USS &quot;Boxer&quot; ARG, off the coast of Yemen with roughly 4,500 U.S. Marines of the 13th MEU in the flotilla to provide support to coalition forces in Yemen fighting AQAP militants.

On 16 June 2016, &quot;Boxer&quot; ARG took part in Operation Inherent Resolve; AV-8BII Harriers of the 13th MEU began airstrikes against ISIL in Iraq and Syria.
On 29 June 2016, &quot;New Orleans&quot; hit a major milestone in the deployment as she anchored off the coast of Camp Buehring, Kuwait to offload nearly 1,000 tons of vehicles and machinery for an agricultural wash down, before returning to Manama, Bahrain for mid-deployment maintenance.
A week later, &quot;New Orleans&quot; sailed back into 7th Fleet and entered port on 25 July to visit Colombo, Sri Lanka. In this port, &quot;New Orleans&quot; had the opportunity to enhance US Navy bilateral ties with the Sri Lankan Navy, and exchange best practices on Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR). The visit included several receptions, daily ship tours, sports events with Sri Lankan and US Navy/Marine Corps personnel, and HADR training held by embarked Marines.

In August, &quot;New Orleans&quot; made a port visit in Bali, Indonesia for a few days, then shortly after stopped in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. &quot;New Orleans&quot; completed her WESTPAC deployment, returning to San Diego on 16 September 2016.

===Maintenance Phase===
On 9 January 2017, USS &quot;New Orleans&quot; moved into the Dry-dock Ships Selected Availability (DSRA) at BAE Systems shipyard. The crew and hundreds of contractors went through an extensive list of repairs and upgrades to the ship&#x27;s hull, tanks, ventilation, auxiliary, propulsion, and combat systems. After 10 months being dry docked, on 28 November &quot;New Orleans&quot; was undocked and begun preparation for work ups.

Over the next six months, USS &quot;New Orleans&quot; accomplished moving the crew back onboard from the barge, Engineering Light-Off Assessment (LOA), and Combat Systems Light-Off. By mid-October, &quot;New Orleans&quot; went underway for the first time in 23 months for Contractor Sea Trials. The DSRA and the maintenance phase officially ended with the completion of Type Commander (TYCOM) Sea Trials in mid-November.

===PACBLITZ 2019===
In March 2019, &quot;New Orleans&quot; participated in Exercise Pacific Blitz 19 (PACBLITZ), an exercise that combines logistics and amphibious concepts from exercises Pacific Horizon and Dawn Blitz. PACBLITZ involved 5,000 Marines and Sailors from Marine Expeditionary Force and 5,000 Sailors spread across several installations, including Naval Base San Diego, Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, Naval Surface Warfare Center Port Hueneme and Naval Air Station Point Mugu. The amphibious transport dock USS &quot;Somerset&quot; (LPD-25), guided-missile destroyer USS &quot;Michael Murphy&quot; (DDG-112), maritime prepositioning ship USNS &quot;William R. Button&quot; (T-AK-3012) and aviation logistics ship SS &quot;Curtiss&quot; (T-AVB-4) also participated. The exercise was three weeks long of fast-paced amphibious operations where &quot;New Orleans&quot; launched and recovered multiple LCACs, AAVs, and LCUs off of San Clemente and Camp Pendleton beaches as well as MV-22 Ospreys.

===First LPD/LSV Stern Gate Marriage===
&quot;New Orleans&quot; became the first San Antonio-class amphibious transport dock ship to successfully complete a &quot;stern gate marriage&quot; with an Army logistics support vessel (LSV) while moored in Pearl Harbor on 24 October 2019. A &quot;stern gate marriage&quot; is a maneuver in which a craft&#x27;s bow ramp is lowered onto a ship&#x27;s stern gate for vehicle and cargo transfer. The Army&#x27;s USAV CW3 Harold C. Clinger (LSV-2) was able to safely lower its stern gate into &quot;New Orleans&quot;’ well deck, then Marine Corps vehicles were quickly driven onto &quot;New Orleans&quot;. The successful marriage demonstrates just one more method by which the San Antonio-class can support a myriad of potential missions from humanitarian aid and disaster relief to amphibious assault.

===2019 Homeport Shift to Forward Deployed Naval Force-Japan===
&quot;New Orleans&quot; joined the U.S. 7th Fleet amphibious force in Sasebo, 1 November 2019, transiting the Pacific Ocean from her former homeport of San Diego. Her addition increased the total strength of amphibious ships in Japan to five, joining USS &quot;America&quot; (LHA 6), USS &quot;Green Bay&quot; (LPD 20), USS &quot;Ashland&quot; (LSD 48) and USS &quot;Germantown&quot; (LSD 42).

===20.1 FDNF-J Patrol===
In spring of 2020, &quot;New Orleans&quot; embarked on her maiden voyage as Forward-Deployed Naval Forces-Japan (FDNF-J) for patrol shortly after the homeport shift. She made her presence felt in the East China Sea conducting operations in support of United Nations sanctions against vessels suspected of conducting illegal transfers of oil and other goods to and from North Korea. She maintained mission readiness throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, executing a COVID-free 7th Fleet patrol.

<doc id="233897" wikidata="Q6453724" url="?curid=233897" title="Bloodless surgery">
<text>Bloodless surgery is a non-invasive surgical method developed by orthopedic surgeon Adolf Lorenz, who was known as &quot;the bloodless surgeon of Vienna&quot;. His medical practice was a consequence of his severe allergy to carbolic acid routinely used in operating rooms of the era. His condition forced him to become a &quot;dry surgeon&quot;. Contemporary usage of the term refers to both invasive and noninvasive medical techniques and protocols. The expression does not mean surgery that makes no use of blood or blood transfusion. Rather, it refers to surgery performed without transfusion of allogeneic blood. Champions of bloodless surgery do, however, transfuse products made from allogeneic blood (blood from other people) and they also make use of pre-donated blood for autologous transfusion (blood pre-donated by the patient). Interest in bloodless surgery has arisen for several reasons. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses reject blood transfusions on religious grounds; others may be concerned about bloodborne diseases, such as hepatitis and AIDS.

==History==
During the early 1960s, American heart surgeon Denton Cooley successfully performed numerous bloodless open-heart surgeries on Jehovah&#x27;s Witness patients. Fifteen years later, he and his associate published a report of more than 500 cardiac surgeries in this population, documenting that cardiac surgery could be safely performed without blood transfusion.

Ron Lapin (1941–1995) was an American surgeon, who became interested in bloodless surgery in the mid-1970s. He was known as a &quot;bloodless surgeon&quot; due to his willingness to perform surgeries on severely anemic Jehovah&#x27;s Witness patients without the use of blood transfusions.

Patricia A. Ford (born 1955) was the first surgeon to perform a bloodless bone marrow transplant.

In 1988, Professor James Isbister, a haematologist from Australia, first proposed a paradigm shift back to a patient focus. In 2005, he penned an article in the journal, &#x27;Updates in Blood Conservation and Transfusion alternatives&#x27;. In this article Prof. Isbister coined the term &#x27;patient blood management&#x27;, noting that the focus should be changed from the product to the patient.

==Principles==
Several principles of bloodless surgery have been published.

Preoperative techniques such as erythropoietin (EPO) or iron administration are designed to stimulate the patient&#x27;s own erythropoiesis.

In surgery, control of bleeding is achieved with the use of laser or sonic scalpels, minimally invasive surgical techniques, electrosurgery and electrocautery, low central venous pressure anesthesia (for select cases), or suture ligation of vessels. Other methods include the use of blood substitutes, which at present do not carry oxygen but expand the volume of the blood to prevent shock. Blood substitutes which do carry oxygen, such as PolyHeme, are also under development. Many doctors view acute normovolemic hemodilution, a form of storage of a patient&#x27;s own blood, as a pillar of &quot;bloodless surgery&quot; but the technique is not an option for patients who refuse autologous blood transfusions.

Intraoperative blood salvage is a technique which recycles and cleans blood from a patient during an operation and redirects it into the patient&#x27;s body.

Postoperatively, surgeons seek to minimize further blood loss by continuing administration of medications to augment blood cell mass and minimizing the number of blood draws and the quantity of blood drawn for testing, for example, by using pediatric blood tubes for adult patients.
HBOC&#x27;s such as Polyheme and Hemepure have been discontinued due to severe adverse reactions including death. South Africa was the only country where they were legally authorized as standard treatment but they are no longer available.

==Benefits==
Bloodless medicine appeals to many doctors because it carries low risk of post-operative infection when compared with procedures requiring blood transfusion. Additionally, it may be economically beneficial in some countries. For example, the cost of blood in the US hovers around $500 a unit, including testing. These costs are further increased as, according to Jan Hoffman (an administrator for the blood conservation program at Geisinger Medical Center in Danville, Pennsylvania), hospitals must pick up the tab for the first three units of blood infused per patient per calendar year. By contrast, hospitals may be reimbursed for drugs that boost a patient&#x27;s red blood cell count, a treatment approach often used before and after surgery to reduce the need for a blood transfusion. However, such payments are highly contingent upon negotiations with insurance companies. Geisinger Medical Center began a blood conservation program in 2005 and reported a recorded savings of $273,000 in its first six months of operation. The Cleveland Clinic lowered their direct costs from US$35.5 million in 2009 to $26.4 million in 2012—a savings of nearly $10 million over 3 years.

Health risks appear to be another contributing factor in their appeal, especially in light of recent studies that suggest that blood transfusions can increase the risk of complications and reduce survival rates. Thus, patients who do not receive blood products during hospitalization often recover more quickly, experience fewer complications, and are able to be discharged home more quickly.

<doc id="233899" wikidata="Q206300" url="?curid=233899" title="Mars Global Surveyor">
<text>Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) was an American robotic space probe developed by NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and launched November 1996. MGS was a global mapping mission that examined the entire planet, from the ionosphere down through the atmosphere to the surface. As part of the larger Mars Exploration Program, &quot;Mars Global Surveyor&quot; performed atmospheric monitoring for sister orbiters during aerobraking, and helped Mars rovers and lander missions by identifying potential landing sites and relaying surface telemetry.

It completed its primary mission in January 2001 and was in its third extended mission phase when, on 2 November 2006, the spacecraft failed to respond to messages and commands. A faint signal was detected three days later which indicated that it had gone into safe mode. Attempts to recontact the spacecraft and resolve the problem failed, and NASA officially ended the mission in January 2007. MGS remains in a stable near-polar circular orbit at about 450 km altitude and as of 1996, was expected to crash onto the surface of the planet in 2050.

==Objectives==
&quot;Mars Global Surveyor&quot; achieved the following science objectives during its primary mission:
# Characterize the surface features and geological processes on Mars.
# Determine the composition, distribution and physical properties of surface minerals, rocks and ice.
# Determine the global topography, planet shape, and gravitational field.
# Establish the nature of the magnetic field and map the crustal remnant field.
# Monitor global weather and the thermal structure of the atmosphere.
# Study interactions between Mars&#x27; surface and the atmosphere by monitoring surface features, polar caps that expand and recede, the polar energy balance, and dust and clouds as they migrate over a seasonal cycle.

&quot;Mars Global Surveyor&quot; also achieved the following goals of its extended mission:

# Continued weather monitoring to form a continuous set of observations with NASA&#x27;s &quot;Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter&quot;, which reached Mars in March 2006.
# Imaging of possible landing sites for the 2007 &quot;Phoenix&quot; spacecraft, and the 2011 &quot;Curiosity&quot; rover.
# Observation and analysis of key sites of scientific interest, such as sedimentary-rock outcrop sites.
# Continued monitoring of changes on the surface due to wind and ice.

===Loss of contact===
On 2 November 2006, NASA lost contact with the spacecraft after commanding it to adjust its solar panels. Several days passed before a faint signal was received indicating that the spacecraft had entered safe mode and was awaiting further instructions.

On 21 and 22 November 2006, MGS failed to relay communications to the &quot;Opportunity&quot; rover on the surface of Mars. In response to this complication, Mars Exploration Program manager Fuk Li stated, &quot;Realistically, we have run through the most likely possibilities for re-establishing communication, and we are facing the likelihood that the amazing flow of scientific observations from Mars Global Surveyor is over.&quot;

On 13 April 2007, NASA announced the loss of the spacecraft was caused by a flaw in a parameter update to the spacecraft&#x27;s system software. The spacecraft was designed to hold two identical copies of the system software for redundancy and error checking. Subsequent updates to the software encountered a human error when two independent operators updated separate copies with differing parameters. This was followed by a corrective update that unknowingly included a memory fault which resulted in the loss of the spacecraft.

Originally, the spacecraft was intended to observe Mars for 1 Martian year (approximately 2 Earth years). However, based on the vast amount of valuable science data returned, NASA extended the mission three times. MGS remains in a stable near-polar circular orbit at about 450 km altitude, and was expected to crash onto the surface of the planet at some point after about 2047 at the time of its original launch, having by then spent fifty years orbiting the red planet. This is to prevent contamination of the Martian surface with any germs that may be stuck to the spacecraft.

==Spacecraft overview==
The spacecraft, fabricated at the Lockheed Martin Astronautics plant in Denver, is a rectangular-shaped box with wing-like projections (solar panels) extending from opposite sides. When fully loaded with propellant at the time of launch, the spacecraft weighed . Most of its mass lies in the box-shaped module occupying the center portion of the spacecraft. This center module is made of two smaller rectangular modules stacked on top of each other, one of which is called the equipment module and holds the spacecraft&#x27;s electronics, science instruments, and the 1750A mission computer. The other module, called the propulsion module, houses its rocket engines and propellant tanks. The Mars Global Surveyor mission cost about $154 million to develop and build and $65 million to launch. Mission operations and data analysis cost approximately $20 million/year.

===Scientific instruments===

Five scientific instruments flew aboard MGS:

* The Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) operated by Malin Space Science Systems – The Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC), originally known as Mars Observer Camera, used 3 instruments: a narrow angle camera that took (black-and-white) high resolution images (usually 1.5 to 12 m per pixel) and red and blue wide angle pictures for context (240 m per pixel) and daily global imaging (7.5 km per pixel). MOC returned more than 240,000 images spanning portions of 4.8 Martian years, from September 1997 and November 2006.
*The Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) – MOLA was designed to determine Mars&#x27; global topography. It operated as an altimeter until a portion of the laser reached end-of-life in June 2001. The instrument then functioned as a radiometer until October 2006.

* The Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) – This instrument mapped the mineral composition of the surface by scanning thermal emissions.
* A magnetometer and electron reflectometer (MAG/ER) – This instrument was used to interrogate the planet&#x27;s magnetic fields and determine that Mars does not have a global magnetic field but rather many smaller localized fields.
* The Ultrastable Oscillator (USO/RS) – Precise clock measurements from this device were used to map variations in the gravitational field.
* The Mars Relay (MR) – The Mars Relay antenna supported the Mars Exploration Rovers for data relay back to Earth in conjunction with the Mars Orbiter Camera&#x27;s 12 MB memory buffer.

==First complete test of aerobraking==
The spacecraft was launched from a smaller Delta II rocket, necessitating restrictions in spacecraft weight. In order to achieve the near-circular orbit required for the mission while conserving propellant, the team designed a series of aerobraking maneuvers. Aerobraking had been successfully attempted by the Magellan mission at Venus, but the first complete test of the new procedure was to be carried out by MGS.

Initially, MGS was placed in a highly elliptical orbit that took 45 hours to complete. The orbit had a periapsis of above the northern hemisphere, and an apoapsis of above the southern hemisphere. This would subsequently be adjusted into its circular science orbit.

After orbital insertion, MGS performed a series of orbit changes to lower the periapsis of its orbit into the upper fringes of the Martian atmosphere at an altitude of about . During every atmospheric pass, the spacecraft slowed down because of atmospheric resistance. This slowing caused the spacecraft to lose altitude on its next pass through the orbit&#x27;s apoapsis. MGS had planned to use this aerobraking technique over a period of four months to lower the high point of its orbit from to altitudes near .

About one month into the mission, it was discovered that air pressure from the planet&#x27;s atmosphere caused one of the spacecraft&#x27;s two solar panels to bend backwards. The panel in question had incurred a small amount of damage shortly after launch, the extent of which did not become apparent until subjected to atmospheric forces. MGS had to be raised out of the atmosphere to prevent further damage to the solar panel and a new mission plan had to be developed.

From May to November 1998, aerobraking was temporarily suspended to allow the orbit to drift into the proper position with respect to the Sun and enable optimal use of the solar panels. Although data collection during aerobraking was not in the original mission plan, all science instruments remained functional and acquired vast amounts of data during this &quot;unexpected bonus period of observation&quot;. The team was able to evaluate more information about the atmosphere over a range of times rather than the anticipated fixed times of 0200 and 1400, as well as collect data during three close encounters with Phobos.

Finally, from November 1998 to March 1999, aerobraking resumed and shrank the high point of the orbit down to . At this altitude, MGS circled Mars once every two hours. Aerobraking was scheduled to terminate at the same time the orbit drifted into its proper position with respect to the Sun. In the desired orientation for mapping operations, the spacecraft always crossed the day-side equator at 14:00 (local Mars time) moving from south to north. This geometry was selected to enhance the total quality of the science return.

==Mission results==
===Mapping===
The spacecraft circled Mars once every 117.65 minutes at an average altitude of . The nearly polar orbit (inclination = 93°) which is almost perfectly circular, moved from the south pole to the north pole in just under an hour. The altitude was chosen to make the orbit Sun-synchronous, so that all images that were taken by the spacecraft of the same surface features on different dates were taken under identical lighting conditions. After each orbit, the spacecraft viewed the planet 28.62° to the west because Mars had rotated underneath it. In effect, it was always 14:00 for MGS as it moved from one time zone to the next exactly as fast as the Sun. After seven sols and 88 orbits, the spacecraft would approximately retrace its previous path, with an offset of 59 km to the east. This ensured eventual full coverage of the entire surface.

In its extended mission, MGS did much more than study the planet directly beneath it. It commonly performed rolls and pitches to acquire images off its nadir track. The roll maneuvers, called ROTOs (Roll Only Targeting Opportunities), rolled the spacecraft left or right from its ground track to shoot images as much as 30° from nadir. It was possible for a pitch maneuver to be added to compensate for the relative motion between the spacecraft and the planet. This was called a CPROTO (Compensation Pitch Roll Targeting Opportunity), and allowed for some very high resolution imaging by the onboard MOC (Mars Orbiting Camera).

In addition to this, MGS could shoot pictures of other orbiting bodies, such as other spacecraft and the moons of Mars. In 1998 it imaged what was later called the Phobos monolith, found in MOC Image 55103.
After analyzing hundreds of high-resolution pictures of the Martian surface taken by the spacecraft, a team of researchers found that weathering and winds on the planet create landforms, especially sand dunes, remarkably similar to those in some deserts on Earth.

Other discoveries from this mission are:

* The planet was found to have a layered crust to depths of 10 km or more. To produce the layers, large amounts of material had to be weathered, transported and deposited.
* The northern hemisphere is probably just as cratered as the southern hemisphere, but the craters are mostly buried.
* Many features, like impact craters, were buried, then recently exhumed.

* Large areas of Mars are covered by a mantle that coats all but the very steepest slopes. The mantle is sometimes smooth, sometimes pitted. Some believe the pits are due to the escape of water through sublimation (ice changing directly to a vapor) of buried ice.

* Some areas are covered by hematite-rich material. The hematite could have been put in place by liquid water in the past.
* Dark streaks were found to be caused by giant dust devils. Dust devil tracks were observed to frequently change; some changed in just one month.

* The south pole&#x27;s residual cap was observed to look like Swiss cheese, with holes generally a few meters deep. The holes get bigger each year, so this region or hemisphere may be warming. Claims that this represents a global trend, however, are cherry-picking regional data versus the planetary dataset, and MOC results versus TES and radio science (see below).

* The Thermal Emission Spectrometer observes in infrared for atmospheric studies and mineralogy. TES found that Mars&#x27; planetary climate has cooled since Viking, and just about all of the surface of Mars is covered with volcanic rock.

* Hundreds of house-sized boulders were found in some areas. This indicates that some materials are strong enough to hold together, even when moving downslope. Most of the boulders appeared in volcanic regions so they were probably formed from weathered lava flows.

* Thousands of dark slope streaks were observed. Most scientists believe they result from the avalanching of dust. However, some researchers think that water may be involved.

===The Lense–Thirring test===

Data from MGS have been used to perform a test of the general relativistic Lense–Thirring precession which consists of a small precession of the orbital plane of a test particle moving around a central, rotating mass such as a planet. The interpretation of these results has been debated.

===Further evidence for water on Mars===

Hundreds of gullies were discovered that were formed from liquid water, possibly in recent times.

A few channels on Mars displayed inner channels that suggest sustained fluid flows. The most well-known is the one in Nanedi Valles. Another was found in Nirgal Vallis.

On 6 December 2006 NASA released photos of two craters in Terra Sirenum and Centauri Montes which appear to show the presence of flowing water on Mars at some point between 1999 and 2001. The pictures were produced by Mars Global Surveyor and are quite possibly the spacecraft&#x27;s final contribution to our knowledge of Mars and the question of whether water exists on the planet.

<doc id="233900" wikidata="Q642700" url="?curid=233900" title="Cabot Trail">
<text>The Cabot Trail is a scenic highway on Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia, Canada. It is a loop around the northern tip of the island, passing along and through the Cape Breton Highlands and the Cape Breton Highlands National Park.

It is named after the explorer John Cabot who landed in Atlantic Canada in 1497, although modern historians agree his landfall likely took place in Newfoundland and not Cape Breton Island. Premier Angus L. MacDonald wanted to re-brand Nova Scotia for tourism purposes as primarily Scottish and, as part of this effort, created both the names Cape Breton Highlands and Cabot Trail. Construction of the initial route was completed in 1932.

The western and eastern sections follow the rugged coastline, with views of the ocean. The southwestern section passes through the Margaree River valley before passing along Bras d&#x27;Or Lake. The route is within the county municipalities of Victoria and Inverness.

The Cabot Trail includes all of Trunk 30, as well as the portion of Nova Scotia Highway 105 between exits 7 and 11. Following are some stops along the route, travelling clockwise from the south:
* Baddeck, the location of the Alexander Graham Bell National Historic Site.
* Chéticamp, an Acadian fishing village.
* Pleasant Bay, site of a bay with whale watching possibilities.
* Cape North, a headland at the northernmost point of the Cabot Trail.
* Dingwall, a small fishing village.
* Ingonish, site of the Keltic Lodge resort and Cape Smokey Provincial Park.
* St. Anns, home of the Gaelic College of Celtic Arts and Crafts.

<doc id="233908" wikidata="Q877458" url="?curid=233908" title="Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem">
<text>The Greek Orthodox patriarch of Jerusalem or Eastern Orthodox patriarch of Jerusalem, officially patriarch of Jerusalem (; ; ), is the head bishop of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem, ranking fourth of nine patriarchs in the Eastern Orthodox Church. Since 2005, the Eastern Orthodox patriarch of Jerusalem has been Theophilos III. The patriarch is styled &quot;Patriarch of the Holy City of Jerusalem and all Holy Land, Syria, beyond the Jordan River, Cana of Galilee, and Holy Zion.&quot; The patriarch is the head of the Brotherhood of the Holy Sepulchre, and the religious leader of about 130,000 Eastern Orthodox Christians in the Holy Land, most of them Palestinian Christians in Israel and Palestine. 

The patriarchate traces its line of succession to the first Christian bishops of Jerusalem, the first being James the Just in the 1st century AD. Jerusalem was granted autocephaly in 451 by the Council of Chalcedon and in 531 became one of the initial five patriarchates.

On the importance of Jerusalem in Christianity, the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; reads:
==History==

In the Apostolic Age the Christian Church was organized as an indefinite number of local Churches that in the initial years looked to that at Jerusalem as its main centre and point of reference. James the Just, who was martyred around 62, is described as the first bishop of Jerusalem. Roman persecutions following the Jewish revolts against Rome in the later 1st and 2nd centuries also affected the city&#x27;s Christian community, and led to Jerusalem gradually being eclipsed in prominence by other sees, particularly those of Constantinople, Antioch, Alexandria, and Rome. However, increased pilgrimage during and after the reign of Constantine the Great increased the fortunes of the see of Jerusalem, and in 325 the First Council of Nicaea attributed special honor, but not metropolitan status (then the highest rank in the Church), to the bishop of Jerusalem. Jerusalem continued to be a bishopric until 451, when the Council of Chalcedon granted Jerusalem independence from the metropolitan of Antioch and from any other higher-ranking bishop, granted what is now known as autocephaly, in the council&#x27;s seventh session whose &quot;Decree on the Jurisdiction of Jerusalem and Antioch&quot; contains: &quot;the bishop of Jerusalem, or rather the most holy Church which is under him, shall have under his own power the three Palestines&quot;. This led to Jerusalem becoming a patriarchate, one of the five patriarchates known as the pentarchy, when the title of &quot;patriarch&quot; was created in 531 by Justinian I.

When the Great Schism took place in 1054 the Patriarch of Jerusalem and the other three Eastern Patriarchs formed the Eastern Orthodox Church, and the Patriarch of Rome (i.e. the Pope) formed the Roman Catholic Church.

In 1099 the Crusaders appointed a Latin patriarch. As a result, the Eastern Orthodox patriarchs lived in exile in Constantinople until 1187.

==Current position==
Today, the headquarters of the patriarchate is the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem.

The number of Eastern Orthodox Christians in the Holy Land is estimated to be about 200,000. A majority of Church members are Palestinian Arabs, and there are also a small number of Assyrians, Greeks and Georgians.

In 2005, Patriarch Irenaios was deposed by the Holy Synod of Jerusalem after being accused of involvement in the sale of church land in East Jerusalem to Israeli investors. A special Pan-Orthodox Synod was convened in Constantinople (Istanbul) to review the decision of the Holy Synod of Jerusalem. The Pan-Orthodox Synod under the presidency of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople Bartholomew I, overwhelmingly confirmed the decision of the Brotherhood of the Holy Sepulchre and struck Irenaios&#x27; name from the diptychs. Metropolitan Cornelius of Petra was chosen to serve as locum tenens pending the election of a replacement for Irenaios. On August 22, 2005, Theophilos, the former Archbishop of Tabor, was elected as the 141st Patriarch of Jerusalem.

==List of patriarchs==

===Resident in Jerusalem (451–1099)===
The Council of Chalcedon in 451 raised the bishop of Jerusalem to the rank of patriarch (see Pentarchy). However, Byzantine politics meant that Jerusalem passed from the jurisdiction of the Patriarch of Antioch to the Greek authorities in Constantinople. For centuries, Eastern Orthodox clergy, such as the Brotherhood of the Holy Sepulchre, dominated the Jerusalem church.

<text>BBC Radio 5 Live is a British national radio station owned and operated by the BBC. It broadcasts mainly news, sport, discussion, interviews and phone-ins, and is on air 24 hours a day. It is the principal BBC radio station covering sport in the United Kingdom, broadcasting virtually all major sports events staged in the UK or involving British competitors. The station broadcasts from MediaCityUK in Salford, England, and is a department of the BBC North division.

Radio 5 Live was launched in March 1994 as a repositioning of the original Radio 5, which was launched in 1990. It is transmitted via analogue radio in AM on medium wave 693 and 909 kHz and digitally via digital radio, television and on the BBC Sounds service. Overnight programming of 5 Live are also simulcast on BBC Local Radio stations throughout the UK. Due to rights restrictions, coverage of some events on Radio 5 Live, particularly live sport, is not available online or is restricted to UK addresses.

According to RAJAR, the station broadcasts to a weekly audience of 4.8 million with a listening share of 2.9% as of March 2024.

==History==
The success of Radio 4 News FM during the first Gulf War (1991) led the BBC to propose the launch of a rolling-news service. Initially the plan was to broadcast a rolling news service on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s long wave frequency; but this met with considerable opposition, both internally and externally, so the BBC decided to close BBC Radio 5 and replace the old service&#x27;s educational and children&#x27;s programmes with a new news service, while retaining the sports programmes. BBC Radio 5 Live began its 24-hour service at 5am on Monday 28 March 1994. The first voice on air, Jane Garvey, later went on to co-present the breakfast and drive-time shows with Peter Allen. &quot;The Times&quot; described the launch as &quot;slipp[ing] smoothly and confidently into a routine of informative banter&quot; and &quot;The Scotsman&quot; as &quot;professionalism at its slickest&quot;.

The news of the first day was dominated by the fatal stabbing at Hall Garth School near Middlesbrough, the first of many major incidents which the network covered live as they unfolded.

The tone of the channel, engaging and more relaxed than contemporary BBC output, was the key to the channel&#x27;s success and set the model for other BBC News services later in the decade. The first audiences were some 4 million, with a record audience of 6.25 million. Among the key editorial staff involved in the design of programme formats and recruitment of staff for the new station were Sara Nathan, later editor of Channel 4 News, and Tim Luckhurst, later editor of &quot;The Scotsman&quot; newspaper and professor of Journalism at the University of Kent.
In 2000, the station was rebranded with a new logo which would remain with the station for another seven years. In addition, on 2 February 2002 a companion station, BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra, was launched as a digital-only service to complement the range of sport and to avoid clashes; previously BBC Local Radio stations and the long-wave frequency of BBC Radio 4 were used. Throughout this period, Five Live gained several awards including five Sony Awards in 2005; the single gold award was for its coverage of the 2004 Asian tsunami in the News Story Award category alongside another four silver awards and six nominations. The station also began to further its boundaries with the publication of the &quot;Radio Five Live Sporting Yearbook&quot;. In August 2007, BBC Radio 5 Live was given a new logo in line with the rest of the BBC Radio network, and a new background design featuring diagonal parallel lines.
In 2008, the BBC announced that the station would move to MediaCityUK in Salford.

In 2017/18, it was noted the station not only remained as having the fourth highest cost-per-user of all the BBC radio output, but whose costs also increased – rising from 2.3p per hour the previous year to 2.5p per hour, therefore equal to 1Xtra. The audience Appreciation Index figure did not increase, remaining at 79.9; and the average length of time spent on the channel fell from 06:41 to 06:34 – the fourth lowest fall of all of the BBC&#x27;s radio stations.

==Broadcast==
BBC Radio 5 Live broadcasts in AM on the medium wave frequencies 693 and 909 kHz nationally, with the frequency 990 kHz used in Cardigan Bay in west Wales; these frequencies had been utilised by the old BBC Radio 5, which in turn had taken over the frequencies from BBC Radio 2. Uniquely to the BBC Radio network, it is the only station that is neither purely digital (such as 1Xtra, Radio 4 Extra and 6 Music) nor broadcast in analogue on FM. It is however broadcast in stereo on FM and DAB on BBC Local Radio frequencies overnight, usually from 1am until BBC Local Radio commences morning broadcasts, usually from 6am. BBC Radio 5 Live is also broadcast on BBC Radio Cymru in stereo from midnight until 5:30am, on BBC Radio Scotland from 1am until 6am and on BBC Radio Ulster from midnight until 6:30am. In addition to the AM output, the station also broadcasts digitally in mono on DAB Digital Radio, and on television through satellite services such as Sky, cable services such as Virgin Media, DTT services such as Freeview, Freesat and through IPTV. The station also broadcasts programmes live through BBC Sounds, which allows replaying programmes up to a month after the original broadcast. The service is also available on the Radioplayer internet site partially run by the BBC.

For many years, the station operated from four floors within the News Centre at BBC Television Centre, because of the close connections between the station and BBC News, and the co-location of BBC Sport. However, as part of the corporation&#x27;s plan to sell off Television Centre, the decision was made in 2008 to move BBC Radio 5 Live to the new broadcast hub at MediaCityUK. The move itself began in September 2011 and took two months. The new studios occupy a single floor in Quay House, with two studios large enough for several guests and a separate studio for large groups. The station continues to have a studio presence in London, with Studio 51A at BBC Broadcasting House in London used for programmes and interviews made in London for the station such as &quot;Kermode and Mayo&#x27;s Film Review&quot;.

==Programming==
===News===

BBC Radio 5 Live&#x27;s remit includes broadcasting rolling news and transmitting news as it breaks. It offers news bulletins every half an hour, apart from during live sports commentaries. The BBC&#x27;s policy for major breaking news events revolves around a priority list. With UK news, the correspondent first records a &quot;generic minute&quot; summary (for use by all stations and channels); the subsequent priority is to report on Radio 5 Live, then the BBC News Channel, and then any other programmes that are on air. For foreign news, first a &quot;generic minute&quot; is recorded, then reports are to BBC World Service radio, then the reporter talks to any other programmes that are on air.

Due to COVID-19, the hourly news bulletins were shared with BBC Radio 2 from April 2020. Three minute bulletins are broadcast on the hour, with extended five minute bulletins at 06:00, 07:00, 08:00, 13:00 and 17:00 on weekdays, at 07:00 and 08:00 on Saturdays and at 06:00, 07:00, 08:00 and 09:00 on Sundays.

Half-hour news headlines are mostly read by presenters and sports journalists, although newsreaders are used during weekday daytime programming between 10:30 and 15:30 and during 5 Live Sport evening and weekend programming.

===Sport===

BBC Radio 5 Live broadcasts an extremely wide range of sports and covers all the major sporting events, mostly under its flagship sports banner &quot;5 Live Sport&quot;. In the event that the broadcast rights to a particular event are also on BBC Television and a technical fault were to ensue, the commentary of 5 Live is simulcast on the affected BBC channel until the problem is rectified. One such occurrence was during Euro 2008 where thunderstorms caused satellite disruptions, but BBC One simulcast the 5 Live commentary.

While football commentaries form the majority of live commentaries during the football season, the range of events covered by the station include:

==5 Sports Extra==

As 5 Live cannot accommodate all of the sports which they have rights to broadcast, some are covered on sister station Sports Extra, including:

*Test Match Special commentary of all home England cricket tests, One Day Internationals and T20 Internationals 
*Cricket World Cup, ICC Champions Trophy, and Twenty20 World Cup
*Selected County Championship, Royal London One-Day Cup and Vitality Blast games from BBC Local Radio
*Selected Super League and Challenge Cup Rugby League games 
*All &#x27;Grand Slam&#x27; Tennis tournaments
*Selected Premiership Rugby and European Rugby Champions Cup games from BBC Local Radio
*Formula One
*IIHF World Championships
*Action from any other competition broadcast on 5 Live

Sports Extra typically emphasises full broadcasts of Premier League and Home Nations football, if games overlap each other. 5 Live carries the first-choice match in such cases.

Also, should 5 Live be needed to broadcast news coverage when scheduled sports programmes were to be aired, the sports coverage is shifted to 5 Sports Extra.

The station had originally launched in 2002 as Radio 5 Live Sports Extra but had its name changed in 2022 as part of a rebranding of the BBC.

==Awards==
In January 2013, BBC Radio Five Live was nominated for the Responsible Media of the Year award at the British Muslim Awards.

<text>The president of the Islamic Republic of Iran () is the head of government of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the second highest-ranking official, after the supreme leader. The first election was held in 1980 and was won by Abulhassan Banisadr. Masoud Pezeshkian currently serves as the president of Iran, after being elected in the 2024 Iranian presidential election and being officially endorsed by the supreme leader.

==History==

After the Iranian Revolution of 1979 and 1979 Iranian Islamic Republic referendum on March 29 and 30, the new government needed to craft a new constitution. Supreme Leader Ruhollah Khomeini, ordered an election for the Assembly of Experts, the body tasked with writing the constitution. The assembly presented the constitution on October 24, 1979, and Supreme Leader Ruhollah Khomeini and Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan approved it.

The 1979 Constitution designated the supreme leader of Iran as the head of state and the president and prime minister as the heads of government. The post of prime minister was abolished in 1989.

The first Iranian presidential election was held on January 25, 1980, and resulted in the election of Abulhassan Banisadr with 76% of the votes. Banisadr was impeached on June 22, 1981, by Parliament. Until the early election on July 24, 1981, the duties of the President were undertaken by the Provisional Presidential Council. Mohammad-Ali Rajai was elected president on July 24, 1981, and took office on August 2. Rajai was in office for less than one month because he and his prime minister were both assassinated in a bombing. Once again a Provisional Presidential Council filled the office until October 13, 1981, when Ali Khamenei was elected president.

The election on August 3, 2005 resulted in a victory for Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The election on June 12, 2009 was reported by government authorities as a victory for Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the incumbent candidate, although this is greatly disputed by supporters of rival candidates, who noted the statistical anomalies in voting reports and large-scale overvoting in the officially announced tallies.

Ali Khamenei, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Mohammad Khatami, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Hassan Rouhani were each elected president for two terms.

The most recent president of Iran was Ebrahim Raisi. He succeeded Hassan Rouhani, who served eight years in office from 2013 to 2021. On May 19, 2024, a helicopter carrying Raisi crashed in the East Azerbaijan Province of Iran. There were no survivors at the crash site. Raisi was the second president of Iran to have died in office. Taghi Rahmani, the husband of detained activist and Nobel laureate Narges Mohammadi, said Raisi&#x27;s death would not structurally change the Iranian leadership under Khamenei. Following his death, first vice president Mohammad Mokhber was designated as acting president until new elections could be held on 28 June.

== Office ==

The president is required to gain the supreme leader&#x27;s official approval before being sworn in by the Parliament, and the supreme leader has the power to dismiss the elected president if he has either been impeached by Parliament or found guilty of a constitutional violation by the Supreme Court. The supreme leader holds all the power. The president answers to the supreme leader, who functions as the country&#x27;s head of state, and executes his decrees. Unlike the executive in other countries, the president of Iran does not have full control over the government, which is ultimately under the direct control of the supreme leader. Before elections, nominees to become a presidential candidate must be approved by the Guardian Council. Members of the Guardian Council are chosen by the supreme leader. The president of Iran is elected for a four-year term by direct vote and is not permitted to run for more than two consecutive terms.

Chapter IX of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran sets forth the qualifications for presidential candidates. The procedures for presidential election and all other elections in Iran are outlined by the supreme leader. The president functions as the executive of the decrees and wishes of the supreme leader, including: signing treaties with foreign countries and international organizations; and administering national planning, budget, and state employment affairs.

The president appoints the ministers, subject to the approval of Parliament and the supreme leader, who can dismiss or reinstate any of the ministers and vice presidents at any time, regardless of the president or parliament&#x27;s decision. The supreme leader also directly chooses the ministers of defense, intelligence, foreign affairs, and interior, as well as certain other ministries, such as the Science Ministry. Iran&#x27;s foreign policy is directly controlled by the office of the supreme leader, with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs&#x27; role limited to protocol and ceremonial occasions. All of Iran&#x27;s ambassadors to Arab countries, for example, are chosen by the Quds Corps, which reports directly to the supreme leader.

The current supreme leader Ali Khamenei, ruling Iran for more than three decades, has issued decrees and made final decisions on economy, education, environment, foreign policy, national planning, and almost everything else in the country. Khamenei has also made final decisions on the degree of transparency in elections in Iran, and has fired and reinstated presidential cabinet appointments.

==Qualifications and election==
The procedures for presidential election and all other elections in Iran are outlined by the supreme leader. The president of Iran is elected for a four-year term in a national election by universal adult suffrage by everyone of at least 18 years of age. Presidents can only be reelected once if in a consecutive manner. Candidates for the presidency must be approved by the Council of Guardians, which is a twelve-member body consisting of six clerics selected directly by Iran&#x27;s supreme leader (who may also dismiss them and replace them at any time), and six lawyers proposed by the supreme leader–appointed head of Iran&#x27;s judicial system and subsequently approved by the Majles. According to the Constitution of Iran candidates for the presidency must possess the following qualifications:
*Iranian origin;
*administrative capacity and resourcefulness;
*a good past record;
*trustworthiness and piety; and
*convinced belief in the fundamental principles of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the official madhhab of the country.

Within these guidelines the council vetoes candidates who it deems unacceptable. The approval process is considered to be a check on the president&#x27;s power, and usually amounts to a small number of candidates being approved. In the 1997 election, for example, only four out of 238 presidential candidates were approved by the council. Some Western observers have routinely criticized the approvals process as a way for the council and supreme leader to ensure that only conservative and like-minded Islamic fundamentalists can win office. The council denies this, citing approval of Iranian reformists in previous elections. The council rejects most of the candidates stating that they are not &quot;a well-known political figure&quot;, a requirement by the current law.

The president must be elected with a simple majority of the popular vote. If no candidate receives a majority in the first round, a runoff election is held between the top two candidates.

The president automatically becomes the Head of the Supreme National Security Council and the Head of the Supreme Council of Cultural Revolution.

=== Legality of a woman to be candidate ===
The legality of women running for presidency depends upon the meaning of one of the criteria the candidate is required to fill. The 115th article of the Iranian constitution states that the president must be elected from among &quot;religious and political &quot;men&quot;&quot; or &quot;religious and political &quot;personalities&quot;&quot;, depending on the interpretation (). In 1997, the Guardian Council used the first interpretation to reject the candidature of Azam Taleghani, the first woman to run for presidency. However, before the 2021 presidential election, the guardian council&#x27;s spokesman said that legally there is no impediment for a woman to be president.

===Inability===
According to the article 131 of the Iranian constitution, &quot;In case of death, dismissal, resignation, absence, or illness lasting longer than two months of the President or when his term in office has ended and a new president has not been elected due to some impediments, or similar other circumstances, his first deputy shall assume, with the approval of the Leader, the powers and functions of the President. The Council, consisting of the Speaker of the Islamic Consultative Assembly, Chief Justice, and the first deputy of the President, is obliged to arrange for a new President to be elected within a maximum period of fifty days. In case of death of the first deputy to the President, or other matters which prevent him to perform his duties or when the President does not have a first deputy, the Leader shall appoint another person in his place.&quot;

==Powers and responsibilities==
The president&#x27;s duties include the following, subject to supervision, policy guidance and approval by the supreme leader:

*Second in command (after the supreme leader) of the executive branch of government and chairperson of the cabinet
*The deputy commander-in-chief of the Islamic Republic of Iran Army
*Declares a state of emergency after passage by the parliament (The proclamation of martial law is forbidden.)
*Heads the Supreme National Security Council
*Heads the Supreme Council of the Cultural Revolution
*Appoints the first vice president of Iran and other vice presidents
*Nominates of Cabinet members to the Parliament
*Sends and receives all foreign ambassadors
*Issues decrees
*Issues medals in honor of service for the nation
*Signs treaties, protocols, contracts, after parliamentary approval 
*Signs referendum results and legislation approved by parliament and the judiciary

<doc id="233917" wikidata="Q795596" url="?curid=233917" title="BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra">
<text>BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra (formerly BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra) is a British digital radio station owned and operated by the BBC, and specialising in extended live sports coverage. It is a sister station to BBC Radio 5 Live and shares facilities, presenters and management, and is a department of the BBC North Group division.

If a major news story breaks during the live sport broadcasts on 5 Live, the sports coverage may sometimes be redirected and continued on 5 Sports Extra, while 5 Live switches to live news.

The station is only available on digital radio, television platforms and BBC Sounds. For licensing reasons, international streaming of the station has not been available since 25 July 2016.

According to RAJAR, the station broadcasts to a weekly audience of 971,000 with a listening share of 0.2% as of March 2024.

==History==

BBC Radio Five Live Sports Extra launched as part of the BBC&#x27;s expansion into digital radio by launching several digital only stations that would complement existing coverage. At the time of launch, all radio sports coverage was included as part of BBC Radio 5 Live&#x27;s mix of news and sport, the longwave frequencies of BBC Radio 4 or on individual BBC Local Radio stations. As these platforms could not accommodate any additional sports, a new service was launched: BBC Radio Five Live Sports Extra. The station began broadcasts at 2:30pm on 2 February 2002. Juliette Ferrington introduced the first programme – commentary of the Premier League match between Manchester United and Sunderland.
In 2007, the station was rebranded in line with the rest of the network. The new BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra logo was turned into a circular based logo in the colour green; according to research, the green colour was chosen as people associated it with sport. In addition, a new background of blue and red diagonal lines on the same green colour was adopted for promotions for the service. Along with the rebrand, Sports Extra became more closely aligned with 5 Live. As a result, the online presence of the station was toned down with only an upcoming schedule remaining; all other details were merged into the 5 Live website or the new BBC Radio online homepage.

In 2011 the station, along with 5 Live, moved to MediaCityUK in Salford.

In 2022, the station&#x27;s name was shortened to Radio 5 Sports Extra as part of a rebranding of the BBC.

==Broadcast==
BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra is broadcast only on digital platforms. It is transmitted on DAB Digital Radio and on digital television through satellite services, such as Sky and Freesat, cable operators, such as Virgin Media, DTT services via Freeview, and on IPTV. The service is also available online through the BBC website, the BBC Sounds service and the Radioplayer service part owned by the BBC. The BBC Sounds platform also re-broadcasts programmes for catch-up after original broadcast. Due to rights restrictions, some programmes are restricted to UK audiences or are not available on the BBC&#x27;s online services.
The station is a part-time service, only airing during ongoing sports broadcasts. Although it mostly broadcasts sports coverage not available on Radio 5 Live, sometimes, sections of sports coverage on Radio 5 Sports Extra will be broadcast on Radio 5 Live, such as the for final part of the Formula 1 qualifying or occasionally other major sports, such as cricket.

The broadcasts themselves are live and uninterrupted except when updates are given by commentators to listeners on Radio 5 Live, as opposed to sports coverage on Radio 5 Live which has interuptions for other sports updates and regular news bulletins. During Sports Extra&#x27;s downtime, the station does not simulcast any other broadcast although a label for Sports Extra is continuously radiated on the DAB multiplex to allow those tuning their radio to store the station to their device even if it is not on air. On digital TV platforms, where Sports Extra has its own dedicated full-time stream, not sharing feed capacity with any other services, a looping promotional barker is played if no live programming is scheduled; the EPG information during this reel will often give details of the next live event to be covered by the station, should this information be available. The Sports Extra internet stream, which used to go off air when live content was not running, now also broadcasts the promo loop.

The station&#x27;s controller is Jonathan Wall, who is also responsible for 5 Live and is answerable to the BBC North and BBC Audio &amp; Music departments. The station operates from Quay House in MediaCityUK on a single floor alongside 5 Live. Although 5 Sports Extra uses no studio space, the teams required to organise the match coverage are shared with 5 Live. The move to Salford took two months, and occurred alongside 5 Live, in a bid to create a northern media hub and to outsource major production from London. Previously, 5 Sports Extra had been located alongside 5 Live in BBC Television Centre and spread over several floors.

Any live sports programmes, only broadcast on the BBC Sport Web Site and BBC Sport App are not available to listen to again on BBC Sounds. This is the case when you see the words 

Only programmes broadcast on the BBC radio stations, including BBC 5 Sports Extra, are available to listen to again. This differs from the iPlayer Red Button, which is available to watch again, even if it is not broadcast on a television channel.

==Programming==
5 Sports Extra broadcast a variety of sports including:

*Test Match Special
*Cricket World Cup, ICC Champions Trophy, and Twenty20 World Cup
*Royal London One-Day Cup and T20 Blast
*Cricket&#x27;s County Championship
*Full broadcasts of Premier League and Home Nation football if games overlap, with 5 Live carrying first-choice in these cases
*Major League Baseball&#x27;s World Series, since 2004
*Wimbledon Tennis championships, with the station providing extra court commentary for the first week of the tournament
*National Hockey League&#x27;s Stanley Cup Finals
*Tennis Grand Slam tournament coverage of non-final rounds and some other major tennis tournaments
*Formula One motor racing
*Action from any other competition broadcast on 5 Live

Through the 2012 season, 5 Live and 5 Live Sports Extra carried NFL late games broadcast on Sunday evening, with coverage taken from Westwood One, except the NFL International Series and Super Bowl, which used BBC-produced commentaries. Absolute Radio 90s acquired the broadcast rights to the NFL beginning in 2013. BBC Radio 5 Live and 5 Live Sports Extra reacquired the rights to NFL games for the 2014–15 playoffs.

<text>HiperLAN (High Performance Radio LAN) is a wireless LAN standard. It is a European alternative for the IEEE 802.11 standards. It is defined by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). In ETSI the standards are defined by the BRAN project (Broadband Radio Access Networks). The HiperLAN standard family has four different versions.

== HiperLAN/1 ==
Planning for the first version of the standard, called HiperLAN/1, started 1992, when planning of 802.11 was already going on. The goal of the HiperLAN was the high data rate, higher than 802.11. The standard was approved in 1997. The functional specification is EN300652, the rest is in ETS300836.

The standard covers the physical layer and the media access control part of the data link layer like 802.11. There is a new sublayer called Channel Access and Control sublayer (CAC). This sublayer deals with the access requests to the channels. The accomplishing of the request is dependent on the usage of the channel and the priority of the request.

CAC layer provides hierarchical independence with Elimination-Yield Non-Preemptive Multiple Access mechanism (EY-NPMA). EY-NPMA codes priority choices and other functions into one variable length radio pulse preceding the packet data. EY-NPMA enables the network to function with few collisions even though there would be a large number of users. Multimedia applications work in HiperLAN because of EY-NPMA priority mechanism. MAC layer defines protocols for routing, security and power saving and provides naturally data transfer to the upper layers.

On the physical layer FSK and GMSK modulations are used in HiperLAN/1.

HiperLAN features:
*range 100 m
*slow mobility (1.4 m/s)
*supports asynchronous and synchronous traffic
*Bit rate - 23.59 Mbit/s
*Description- Wireless Ethernet
*Frequency range- 5 GHz

HiperLAN does not conflict with microwave and other kitchen appliances, which are on 2.4 GHz.
An innovative feature of HIPERLAN 1, which other wireless networks do not offer, is its ability to forward data packets using several relays. Relays can extend the communication on the MAC layer beyond the radio range. For power conservation, a node may set up a specific wake up pattern. This pattern determines at what time the node is ready to receive, so that at other times, the node can turn off its receiver and save energy. These nodes are called p-savers and need so called p-supporters that contain information about wake up patterns of all the p-savers they are responsible for. A p-supporter only forwards data to a p-saver at the moment p-saver is awake. This action also requires buffering mechanisms for packets on p-supporting forwarders.

== HiperLAN/2 ==
HiperLAN/2 functional specification was accomplished February 2000. Version 2 is designed as a fast wireless connection for many kinds of networks. Those are UMTS back bone network, ATM and IP networks. Also it works as a network at home like HiperLAN/1. HiperLAN/2 uses the 5 GHz band and up to 54 Mbit/s data rate.

The physical layer of HiperLAN/2 is very similar to IEEE 802.11a wireless local area networks. However, the media access control (the multiple access protocol) is Dynamic TDMA in HiperLAN/2, while CSMA/CA is used in 802.11a/n.

Basic services in HiperLAN/2 are data, sound, and video transmission. The emphasis is in the quality of these services (QoS).

The standard covers Physical, Data Link Control and Convergence layers. Convergence layer takes care of service dependent functionality between DLC and Network layer (OSI 3). Convergence sublayers can be used also on the physical layer to connect IP, ATM or UMTS networks. This feature makes HiperLAN/2 suitable for the wireless connection of various networks.

On the physical layer BPSK, QPSK, 16QAM or 64QAM modulations are used through OFDM.

HiperLAN/2 offers security measures. The data are secured with DES or Triple DES algorithms. The wireless access point and the wireless terminal can authenticate each other.

Most important worldwide manufacturers of HiperLAN/2 are Alvarion (Israel), Freescale (USA), Panasonic (Japan).

== Failure in the Market ==

Due to competition from IEEE 802.11, which was simpler to implement and made it faster to the market, HiperLAN never received much commercial implementation. Much of the work on HiperLAN/2 has survived in the PHY specification for IEEE 802.11a, which is nearly identical to the PHY of HiperLAN/2. HIPERACCESS was intended as a last-mile technology. HIPERLINK was intended as a short-range point-to-point technology at 155 Mbit/s.

<doc id="233922" wikidata="Q1350303" url="?curid=233922" title="Holly Johnson">
<text>William &quot;Holly&quot; Johnson (born 9 February 1960) is an English artist, musician, and writer, best known as the lead vocalist of Frankie Goes to Hollywood, who achieved huge commercial success in the mid-1980s. Prior to that, in the late 1970s he was a bassist for the band Big in Japan. In 1989, Johnson&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;Blast&quot;, reached number one in the UK albums chart. Two singles from the album – &quot;Love Train&quot; and &quot;Americanos&quot; – reached the top 5 of the UK Singles Chart. In the 1990s, he also embarked on writing, painting, and printmaking careers.

==Early life==
Johnson was born on 9 February 1960 in Liverpool, England, to Eric and Pat (&quot;née&quot; McGlouchlin) Johnson. His paternal grandfather Patrick was Irish and his maternal grandfather Patrick McGlouchlin was of 3/4 Indian descent. Johnson was the third of four children and was nicknamed Billy as a child. He started his education in Liverpool at St Mary&#x27;s Church of England primary school and at age eleven went to the Liverpool Collegiate School in Everton. At fourteen, Johnson took on the name Holly, inspired by actress Holly Woodlawn, a friend of Andy Warhol.

During his second year at the Liverpool Collegiate, Johnson and his friend were teased and nicknamed &quot;Jolly Johnson&quot; and &quot;Honey Heath&quot;. The two shared an interest in Marc Bolan and David Bowie. While he attended Liverpool Collegiate, Johnson was actively involved in that city&#x27;s punk rock/new wave scene of the late 1970s. Johnson played bass with the local band Big in Japan and also released two solo singles on the Eric&#x27;s label. Both &quot;Yankee Rose&quot; and &quot;Hobo Joe&quot; failed to chart, however. Johnson met his partner, Wolfgang Kuhle, in the early 1980s.

Kuhle, Johnson&#x27;s personal manager, became a successful art dealer and collected paintings by Duncan Grant and Vanessa Bell. In 1982, Johnson joined Frankie Goes to Hollywood, and he later found fame as the lead singer and lyricist of the band. In 1987, tension grew between Johnson and the rest of his group. He also had an argument with his record company and won a case in court against them on restraint of trade. He left Frankie Goes to Hollywood and the other members of the band were eventually let go by the label after the court case &quot;ZTT and Perfect Songs v Holly Johnson&quot;.

==Career==
===Frankie Goes to Hollywood===

After gaining some measure of local celebrity from being a member of Big in Japan, Johnson became involved with a group of younger musicians who together would become the nucleus of Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Johnson himself named the new band after seeing the headline of an article about Frank Sinatra. This new band quickly gained a reputation for their stage show which had strong sadomasochistic overtones. It was during this period that guitarist Brian Nash and backing vocalist Paul Rutherford completed the band&#x27;s established lineup.

After the band&#x27;s reputation grew large enough to attract record company interest, they were eventually signed to a new record company, ZTT. Johnson became exposed to the general public via the phenomenal success of their debut single &quot;Relax&quot;, which was a huge, and controversial, hit in 1984. The band&#x27;s first three singles - &quot;Relax&quot; (1983), &quot;Two Tribes&quot; (1984), and &quot;The Power of Love&quot; (1984) all reached No. 1 of the UK Singles Chart; their fourth single, &quot;Welcome to the Pleasuredome&quot; (1985) reached No. 2. Frankie&#x27;s debut album &quot;Welcome to the Pleasuredome&quot;, released in October 1984, sold around a quarter of a million copies in its first week, peaked at No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart, and was a top-10 seller internationally.

After such success during 1984, when the band spent nearly four months at the top of the singles chart, Johnson was firmly established as a household name. By autumn 1986, his star had faded considerably. Frankie Goes to Hollywood had not released any material since early 1985 and were absent from that year&#x27;s Live Aid event. In addition, Johnson did not perform on the successful charity single &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; by Band Aid in December 1984.

Recorded in March–July 1986, Frankie Goes to Hollywood&#x27;s second album, &quot;Liverpool&quot;, was released the following October. &quot;Liverpool&quot; peaked at No. 5 in the UK Albums Chart and spawned three singles: &quot;Rage Hard&quot; (1986), &quot;Warriors of the Wasteland&quot; (1986), and &quot;Watching the Wildlife&quot; (1987). &quot;Rage Hard&quot; was a top 5 hit in the UK Singles Chart, peaking at #4, but &quot;Warriors of the Wasteland&quot; and &quot;Watching the Wildlife&quot; peaked at #19 and #28 respectively, suggesting Frankie&#x27;s popularity was waning. Furthermore, the band was wracked by infighting; by 1987, Johnson&#x27;s relationship with the rest of the band had broken down irretrievably, not helped by his decision to gain legal rights to exclusive use of the band&#x27;s name, without consultation with other members. The UK Intellectual Property Office ruled against Johnson, however. During a reunion on the TV show &quot;Bands Reunited&quot; many years later, when the five members of Frankie Goes to Hollywood were invited to play together using equipment that had been set up for them, he (and guitarist Brian Nash) declined to take part, but he did not rule out the possibility in the future. In his own words; &quot;If it happens, we do it properly. We have a reputation. I&#x27;m not a wedding singer!&quot;

===Solo career and later projects===
====ZTT injunction====

Johnson left Frankie Goes to Hollywood in 1987 because of disagreements regarding their musical direction. He became the subject of an injunction from the group&#x27;s record company, ZTT Records, and its sister publishing company, Perfect Songs, which cited a breach of his prior recording and publishing contracts, thus barring him from pursuing a solo career with any other new label. He embarked on a two-year legal battle with ZTT, the case being settled in Johnson&#x27;s favour on 10 February 1988, the judge ruling that the original contracts had constituted an unreasonable restraint of trade, remarking that &quot;Mr. Johnson could be 70 years old and still be bound to this contract&quot;.

ZTT unsuccessfully appealed against the judge&#x27;s decision, the Appeal Court concluding on 26 July 1989 that the original recording and publishing contracts were &quot;not a fair bargain&quot;. The result represented a landmark legal outcome, contemporary press reports stating that the result &quot;set a legal precedent which rocked the music business&quot;, adding that ZTT had by this time released most of its artists from their original contracts.

Johnson&#x27;s relationship with ZTT owners Trevor Horn and Jill Sinclair broke down irretrievably due to the court case: &quot;They, [Horn and Sinclair] have never really forgiven me for winning my freedom in the law courts&quot;, the singer said in 2001, adding that the worst part of being in FGTH was &quot;the contract we signed with ZTT.&quot;

====&quot;Blast&quot; (1989–1994)====

In 1989, Johnson finally made his first solo debut with the album &quot;Blast&quot;, for MCA Records, which was a major success and reached UK No. 1. Singles &quot;Love Train&quot;, &quot;Americanos&quot; and &quot;Atomic City&quot; met with warm reception, the former two both charting in the UK&#x27;s top 5. Johnson took part in a charity project for the Hillsborough disaster fund and recorded a popular single &quot;Ferry Cross the Mersey&quot; with Paul McCartney, the Christians and others. The single reached number 1 in the UK and Ireland.

After the 1990 remix album &quot;Hollelujah&quot;, Johnson released his second solo album in 1991. &quot;Dreams That Money Can&#x27;t Buy&quot; was a commercial failure and did not chart in the UK, while the singles &quot;Where Has Love Gone?&quot; and &quot;Across the Universe&quot; performed very poorly on UK singles chart. In November 1991, Johnson learned that he was HIV positive. This triggered a temporary withdrawal from the music business and public life in general, with one of his last TV performances around the time being at the Diamond Record Awards, Antwerp, where he performed &quot;Americanos&quot; and &quot;Where Has Love Gone?&quot;. His HIV status was made public during an interview with &quot;The Times&quot; in April 1993.

====&quot;A Bone in My Flute&quot; (1994–2009)====

In March 1994, Johnson&#x27;s critically acclaimed autobiography &quot;A Bone in My Flute&quot; was published, in which he discusses his struggle with, and acceptance of, his homosexuality. The same year, he recorded a new single, &quot;Legendary Children (All of Them Queer)&quot;, whose lyrics referred to famous LGBT people throughout history. During 1994, he performed live at London&#x27;s Gay Pride show, where he performed &quot;Relax&quot;, &quot;Legendary Children&quot; and &quot;The Power of Love&quot;. The same month Johnson featured on and co-wrote the single &quot;Love and Hate&quot; by Ryuichi Sakamoto for his album &quot;Sweet Revenge&quot;.

Since the mid-1990s, Johnson has worked primarily as a painter. His works have been exhibited at the Tate Liverpool and the Royal Academy. He has contributed to &quot;Modern Painters&quot; and the Paul Smith-sponsored &quot;Carlos&quot; magazine. He made a musical comeback in 1999, with a self-released album called &quot;Soulstream&quot;, preceded by the 1998 promo only single &quot;Hallelujah!&quot;. The video for the first available single &quot;Disco Heaven&quot; featured a cameo performance from Boy George. However, the album passed fairly unnoticed and didn&#x27;t chart. The only charting single from &quot;Soulstream&quot; was a new version of &quot;The Power of Love&quot;. For the release of &quot;Soulstream&quot;, Johnson appeared on the Jools Holland Show performing &quot;The Power of Love&quot; and performed the song again in 2004 for ZDF Love Songs.

In April 1998, he performed &quot;The Power of Love&quot; live at the Easter Gay Happening in Krefeld, Germany at Club Königsburg.

====In the Beginning (2009–2023)====
In August 2009, Johnson presented an hour-long show &quot;In the Beginning&quot; on BBC Radio 2 about the Beatles, while he also appeared in the new video for Frankie Goes to Hollywood&#x27;s &quot;Relax&quot; as the DJ. Since then, he has performed &quot;The Power of Love&quot; twice in Germany, also performing the song at the opening of Life Ball 2011 in Vienna. In an interview at the Q Awards, Johnson announced plans for an album of new material. In 2010, Johnson performed &quot;Americanos&quot; on German TV, and &quot;Relax&quot; on French TV. During February 2011, Johnson joined Jools Holland and his band for a version of the Animals&#x27; &quot;The House of the Rising Sun&quot; song, a track that Johnson covered on his &quot;Soulstream&quot; album. In August 2011, he performed a full set live at the Rewind Festival, using a mix of Frankie Goes to Hollywood songs together with some of his solo hits &quot;Americanos&quot;, &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Here&quot; and &quot;Love Train&quot;.

On 5 December 2013, Johnson performed at Save The Children&#x27;s Christmas Tree Sessions at London&#x27;s Union Chapel. He closed the evening with &#x27;The Power Of Love&#x27; accompanied by Gaz Coombes on guitar. In May 2014, Johnson announced his first UK solo tour, named &quot;Dancing with No Fear&quot;. The seven-date tour was preceded by a new solo album, released on 15 September. The album, titled &quot;Europa&quot;, was preceded by a lead single, &quot;Follow Your Heart&quot;.

The second single from &quot;Europa&quot;, &quot;In And Out Of Love&quot;, was released on 4 September 2014 with a special pop promo directed by Chris Shepherd. In October 2014 &quot;Europa&quot; entered the UK Album Chart at # 63, becoming Johnson&#x27;s first album to chart in the UK since his debut &quot;Blast&quot;. In December 2014, Johnson released a live album, only available as merchandise during the tour and his website titled &quot;Unleashed From the Pleasuredome&quot;.

In late 2015, Johnson co-wrote a song with Gary Barlow for the film &quot;Eddie The Eagle&quot;. The song &quot;Ascension&quot; was released in March 2016 as the focus track for the album &quot;Fly&quot; (songs inspired by the film &quot;Eddie The Eagle&quot;) and appears on the end credits for the film. In 2018, Johnson guest starred throughout the final episode of the British TV series &quot;Benidorm&quot;. In 2021, he appeared in the British TV series &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot; and performed &quot;The Power of Love&quot;. In 2022, he hosted Pride Not Prejudice on &quot;Greatest Hits Radio&quot;.

====&quot;Relax&quot; (2023–present)====

In May 2023, Johnson and the other members of Frankie Goes to Hollywood reunited for a one-off performance at the opening night of Eurovision, in their hometown of Liverpool. They performed a single song, &quot;Welcome to the Pleasuredome&quot;, from their inaugural album.

In May 2023 Working Title Films announced production of &quot;Relax&quot;, a musical biographical film about Frankie Goes to Hollywood, based upon Holly Johnson&#x27;s autobiography &quot;A Bone in My Flute&quot; (1994), and starring Callum Scott Howells as Johnson. The film is to be written and directed by Bernard Rose, who directed the original music videos for the band&#x27;s songs &quot;Relax&quot; (1983) and &quot;Welcome to the Pleasuredome&quot; (1985).

From September 2024 to July 2025 the Museum of Liverpool is hosting an exhibition called The Holly Johnson Story. It focusses on Johnson and HIV/AIDs in the city of Liverpool. It has been coproduced by produced by Homotopia, DuoVision Arts and National Museums Liverpool, in collaboration with Holly Johnson.

==Personal life==
Johnson has been referred to as a &quot;monumental LGBTQ+ icon&quot;. In 1991, Johnson was diagnosed with HIV and wrote an autobiography, &quot;A Bone in my Flute&quot;; he did not expect to live much longer. Johnson remained creative working as a painter and printmaker and writing songs until 1994 when he returned to performing music occasionally. One of Johnson&#x27;s paintings appears as the cover to the Kirsty MacColl single &quot;Angel&quot;.

<text>The Canso Causeway () is a rock-fill causeway crossing the Strait of Canso, provides access by road to the Atlantic Ocean, to the Gulf of St. Lawrence or Cape Breton Island to the Nova Scotia peninsula.

Its crest thickness is , carrying the two vehicle traffic lanes of the Trans-Canada Highway, Nova Scotia Highway 104 on the mainland side, and Nova Scotia Highway 105 on the Cape Breton side, as well as the single track mainline of the Cape Breton and Central Nova Scotia Railway.

The causeway opened in 1955 after three years of construction. Constructed in an &quot;S&quot; shape, it has a base width of in waters having a maximum depth of .

Cape Breton Island remains circumnavigable as a result of the wide and long Canso Canal, which is located at the eastern end of the causeway to allow ship traffic to transit the Strait of Canso. The Canso Canal Bridge is a swing bridge which carries the road and railway line across the canal.

The word &quot;Canso&quot; is believed to be derived from the Mi&#x27;kmaq word &quot;kamsok&quot;, which means &quot;opposite the lofty cliffs.&quot;

On July 2, 2014, it was announced that the Government of Canada would transfer ownership of the causeway to the Nova Scotia provincial government. The federal government will still maintain the Canso Canal and the navigational locks.

==Ferries==
Prior to the construction of the causeway, Cape Breton Island was connected to the mainland by separate railway car and motor vehicle ferries.

In 1880, the Intercolonial Railway (ICR) was opened between Mulgrave on the Nova Scotia side, west to New Glasgow. In 1890, the ICR built a line from Point Tupper on the Cape Breton side, east to Sydney. As a result, a rail ferry service was necessary so that rail cars from Cape Breton Island could be interchanged with the mainland North America rail network. Initially a small 2-railcar barge was used, however the growth of traffic from Industrial Cape Breton soon mandated that a dedicated rail ferry service be established. This service was operated by the ICR until 1918 when the ICR was merged into Canadian National Railways (CNR). CNR operated the ferries from 1918 until the causeway opened in 1955. Vessels used included: &quot;Mulgrave&quot; (1893–1901), &quot;Scotia&quot; (1903–1955), and &quot;Scotia II&quot; (1915–1955).

Various private passenger and horse-drawn carriage ferry services operated between Point Tupper or Port Hawkesbury or Port Hastings to the Nova Scotia side. By the 1930s, the Nova Scotia Department of Transportation took responsibility for providing the automobile ferry service. By the 1940s, as a result of war-time travel growth, as well as the growing popularity of automobiles, the service was expanded to 24 hours/day. Toward the end of the service in the 1950s, vessels included the &quot;George H. Murray&quot;, &quot;John Cabot&quot;, &quot;Ponte de Canseau&quot;, and &quot;Sir Charles Tupper&quot;.

==Proposed bridge==
In the late 1890s and early 1900s, the Industrial Cape Breton region was experiencing unprecedented economic growth as a result of multiple coal mines and two large integrated steel mills having opened. The &quot;Scotia&quot; rail car ferry that entered service in 1901 was struggling to keep up with the demands despite operating 24-hours per day year-round. In 1903, an ambitious proposal was presented to the provincial and federal governments, a proposal known as the &quot;Strait of Canso Bridge&quot;, detailing a plan to build a steel cantilever bridge at the narrowest portion of the strait to carry the Intercolonial Railway&#x27;s main line between Sydney and Truro. The span, measuring , would have been longer than the Firth of Forth Bridge and roughly similar in size to the Quebec Bridge.

==Construction==
From 1947 to 1951, articles and cartoons in provincial newspapers indicated that the strait&#x27;s crossing was to be a bridge. Finally, project engineers agreed that because of the size, the amount of ice, the strength of the currents that filled the Strait of Canso every winter, and the depth of the water, it would be difficult to construct a bridge, and instead, a causeway option was chosen.

The Canso Causeway was built at a narrow location on the Strait of Canso, about northwest of Port Hawkesbury and Mulgrave, crossing from Cape Porcupine near Auld&#x27;s Cove on the Nova Scotia side to Port Hastings on the Cape Breton side. About of rock for building the causeway was quarried from a mountain on Cape Porcupine.

Contracts were awarded from May 1952 to build approach roads and rail lines for the causeway construction, and the project was officially started at a ceremony on September 16, 1952 that was attended by federal Minister of Transport Lionel Chevrier and Premier of Nova Scotia Angus L. MacDonald.

The Strait of Canso was permanently blocked on December 10, 1954, and construction continued through the winter on building the roadway and railway line, as well as finishing the Canso Canal and its swing bridge. Construction was finally completed on April 13, 1955, when the railway line and the roadway were finished at a cost of $22 million.

The first train across the causeway was a Canadian National Railways work train, led by steam locomotive #2639 on April 18, 1955. The railway line across the causeway entered active service on Saturday, May 14, 1955, when the first revenue train was a 10-car passenger train, led by steam locomotive #6014, and the rail ferry service from Mulgrave to Point Tupper was then discontinued. The roadway across the causeway opened to vehicle traffic on May 20, 1955, when the vehicle ferry service was discontinued.

==Official opening==
The official opening of the Canso Causeway took place on August 13, 1955 when several thousand people attended ceremonies which included a gala parade of what was meant to be 100 bagpipers heralding Cape Breton&#x27;s road connection to the North American mainland, however, the 100th bagpiper refused to pipe.

==Legacy==

When the causeway was completed, the eastern end of the Strait of Canso became ice free during the winter. Several industries were attracted to the Point Tupper area, including the Stora pulp and paper mill, a Gulf Oil refinery and a heavy water plant.

Aside from blocking sea ice, the blocking of the Strait of Canso caused significant environmental damage from the enormous changes in the tidal regime of the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence all the way to the mouth of the St. Lawrence River. The causeway also had the effect of damming the waterway for migrating ground fish stocks for decades until some of these species were able to determine how to get around Cape Breton Island into the gulf. In addition, the causeway allowed several non-native species of land animals access onto Cape Breton Island. One particularly troublesome interloper has been the bobcat, which has slowly forced the more gentle lynx out of its traditional hunting grounds and up into the Cape Breton Highlands.

From 1955 to the early 1990s, the Canso Causeway charged a toll to motorists. The toll was discontinued after the construction costs (approximately $23 million) were paid off.

In 1993, CN Rail sold its Truro-Sydney railway line which crossed the Canso Causeway to the Cape Breton and Central Nova Scotia Railway. Today, CB&amp;CNS employees operate the swing bridge across the Canso Canal.

<text>Team racing, also known as team sailing, is a popular form of dinghy racing and yacht racing. Two teams compete in a race, each sailing two to four boats of the same class. The winning team is decided by combining the results of each team&#x27;s boats. This differs from an inter-club fleet race where boats from three or more clubs compete, with the results of each club&#x27;s boats combined to determine its overall position.

Team racing employs the low points scoring system. The boat finishing 1st scores 1 point, 2nd scores 2 points, and so on. The points scored by the boats in each team are added together. The team scoring fewest points wins, with additional rules applied to decide ties in the 2 and 4-boat formats.

Short 6 to 10 minute courses are used for team races. One course form is a digital &#x27;S&#x27; on its side, sometimes called a digital &#x27;N&#x27;. This gives a beat from start and mark to starboard; a short reach and mark to starboard; a run and mark to port; a short reach and mark to port; and a beat to finish. The other form is a starboard (right) hand &#x27;box&#x27;. This gives a beat from start/finish; a short reach, a run; a short reach; and a beat to start/finish. These course formats put a premium on racing tactics so that the outcome is not decided by boat speed alone.

On-the-water umpiring is now the norm, since its first introduction in 1987. Boats have the option to do one penalty turn after an infringement. Otherwise they do two penalty turns if they sail on and are penalised by an umpire. The &#x27;Team Racing Companion&#x27;. gives an excellent brief exposition of team racing and its required skills. The further reading section at the end of this page lists it and other relevant publications.

==History of Team Racing in the US, UK, and Ireland - First Events==

Inter-club fleet racing and team racing of a kind has existed as long as yacht racing itself. The earliest recorded regular &#x27;modern&#x27; team racing event, with just two teams of two, three, or four boats battling it out over several races, is the Oxford-Cambridge Varsity Match. between the Cambridge University Cruising Club (CUCrC) and the Oxford University Yacht Club (OUYC). The match was first sailed as a two-a-side team race in 1913 and again in 1914 (1913 at Oxford - they won, 1914 at Ely - Cambridge won). The first sailing contest between the two Universities actually took place in 1912 - as three match races at Ely (Cambridge won 2-1). After World War I team racing recommenced (two boats a side) in 1920 on the neutral waters of Oulton Broad in Norfolk, when Oxford won. It has continued annually at locations around the UK, usually on the coast and three boats a side since the mid 1930s.

In addition, an annual team racing contest (two boats a side) between the colleges of Cambridge has been held since 1924, and a similar competition has been held at Oxford since 1926. The first recorded international team racing event was the British-American Cup series in Six-Metres (4 boats a side). It was first sailed in 1921 at Cowes, as a result of a UK challenge, and the UK won 4-3. The series was hotly contested every two years, particularly pre-World War II. It ceased in 1955, when the US won 4-0 yet again, because costs escalated and interest declined due to the class losing Olympic status in 1952.

==American Universities==

In the US what is now the US Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association (ICSA) was established in 1930 as the ICYRA. Collegiate dinghy sailing in the US blossomed in 1934–36 with initiatives taken by Princeton with its &#x27;Tiger&#x27; dinghies (1934), MIT (the famous Pavilion was founded and built in 1935 at the instigation of Walter C. &#x27;Jack&#x27; Wood), and Brown (1936). The initial emphasis of the ICSA was very much on fleet racing (see Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association for historical details), but during the 1930s, team racing between individual colleges started to emerge - with 2 to 4 colleges meeting up, each fielding 2 to 5 boats.

After World War II collegiate sailing spread across the US and parts of Canada, with ICSA membership rapidly growing to modern numbers. George O’Day (Harvard), Harry Anderson (Yale) and Bill Cox Sr. (Princeton) all helped develop the ICYRA team race rules in the 1940s, and these were the forerunners of the NAYRU (now US Sailing) and International Yacht Racing Union (later International Sailing Federation or ISAF, now World Sailing) team race rules. (International harmonisation of the Racing Rules of Sailing did not take place until 1960.)

A regional team racing championship, four-a-side format, first took place in 1950 in the New England District (now &#x27;Conference&#x27;) for the Leonard M. Fowle Trophy - a separate trophy from the new Fowle Trophy that is awarded to the best college across all 6 national ICSA championships. National team racing for the Walter C. Wood Trophy, four-a-side format, commenced in 1960 between teams formed from colleges within a particular ICSA district or &#x27;conference&#x27;, and results from 1970 are available online From 1977 competing teams have been limited to sailors from one college, and Rhode Island University was the first (1977) winner of the current &#x27;individual college&#x27; team racing championship for the Wood Trophy. The Wood Trophy now runs on a three-a-side format because of the greater ease of accommodating 6 sailors in the one car! Across the border in Canada, intercollegiate sailing has also grown strong since the late 1990s. Courses evolved to current formats in the 2000s.

==British Universities==

The first recorded UK team race between universities, other that Oxford vs Cambridge, was a match between Cambridge and United Hospitals in 1935, which United Hospitals (UH) won. Cambridge medics had to do their clinical training in London until 1976, so there were several ex-Cambridge sailors on the UH team. The first recorded team races against other colleges were in 1947 (University College, London), 1948 (Imperial College, London), 1949 (Trinity College, Dublin), and 1950 (London University) - all won by Cambridge. In 1956 the Association of Northern Universities Sailing Clubs (ANUSC) had been in existence for a few years and was already running its own (Northern) team racing championship. London was invited to the 1956 event, providing further impetus to the founding of BUSA (see next paragraph), in which London played a major role.

The UK equivalent of the ICSA, the British Universities Sailing Association (BUSA), was founded in 1957, partly at the suggestion (in a &#x27;Longshoreman&#x27; article) by Michael Ford of the Oxford University YC team that had toured the US in 1954, initiating what is now the biennial ICSA - BUSA team racing tour, which alternates between the two countries. BUSA focused solely on team racing in its early years, fostering international student team racing, and later widened its interest to dinghy fleet racing, &#x27;big boat&#x27; yachting (currently in Sunsail F40s), and keel boat match racing.

The first UK universities team racing championships was held in 1957 and has taken place annually since then, three-a-side format. The 1957 knock-out event for what is now the Thompson Trophy took place on the Welsh Harp (Brent Reservoir in London) and was won by London University from an entry of 14 teams. Partly because of the influence of Oxford and Cambridge team racing, universities in the UK had sailed individual team racing matches up until that time, or had participated in local contests of three or four teams. There was no fleet racing comparable to North American practice.

Dinghy racing at Oxford started in the 1880s, at Cambridge in the 1890s, and has continued at both universities without interruption to the present day. Cambridge also held a one-week coastal &#x27;Marine Meeting&#x27; event for dinghies, and for larger craft in pre-WWII years. It ran from 1903 to 1966, interrupted only by the two World Wars. Oxford held a similar event for dinghies between 1946 and the 1970s. London University colleges were active in sailing from the late 1920s onwards, along with United Hospitals. Furthermore, London was a major force in UK university team racing in the 1950s and 60s - winning 5 of the first 8 championships.

In part, Oxford-Cambridge team racing rivalry resulted in the formation of the Oxford &amp; Cambridge Sailing Society (O&amp;CSS) by Stewart Morris in 1934 to promote team racing in the UK. Other influences were concern at the &#x27;thrashing&#x27; (4-0) of the British Six-Metre team in the 1932 British-American Cup series, and the interest in team racing being generated by the International 14 Dinghy Class (and its Canadian variants) from 1926 onwards. The O&amp;CSS was successful in its aims, later helping West Kirby SC (near Liverpool) to arrange a single-class open team racing championship in 1949, under the title &#x27;North West Firefly Championship&#x27;. The event, for what was then a very large entry of 17 teams (three-a-side format), used Firefly dinghies conveniently available after the 1948 London and Torquay Olympics. Itchenor SC from Chichester Harbour won this first knock-out event by beating the O&amp;CSS in the final.

==Wilson Trophy / North West of England Firefly Championship / Irish Team Racing==

So began, as mentioned in the last paragraph of the preceding section, what became the famous Wilson Trophy, which remains a leading international team racing event.

The West Kirby initiative was triggered by the results of a joint Irish Dinghy Racing Association (IDRA) and Royal St George YC team racing event held in Dun Laoghaire, Ireland in 1948 (three-a-side format). This was the first team racing event in Britain and Ireland to have national rather than very local entry, but it still made use of several dinghy classes, including the Firefly, because of the shortage of dinghies of one particular class. Royal St. George YC won the event in September 1948, but was almost defeated by the relatively unknown West Kirby team in the final. One of the West Kirby team, (Sir) Cyril Clarke, was a member of the Oxford &amp; Cambridge Sailing Society, and he and the other two helmsmen (Harry Dennis and Glyn Evans) resolved to run a similar event at West Kirby the following year.

After the 1948 Irish event, Dun Laoghaire and its three yacht clubs (Royal St George YC, Royal Irish YC, National YC) became hosts to an Irish equivalent of the Wilson Trophy, known as the Sean Hooper Trophy, which facilitated considerable British-Irish university and club team racing. Since the 1980s the event has been hosted by the Royal St. George YC alone.

==International 14 Class Team Racing==

As mentioned earlier, the International 14 Class has always had a great interest in team racing. The first recorded team race took place in 1926 when Trent SC challenged the Royal Norfolk &amp; Suffolk YC to a three-a-side match in National 14s (international status was not granted until 1928), so initiating the Trent Inland Waters Challenge Cup. The first international team racing event (three-a-side format), between Canada, the US (two teams from Long Island and Rochester), and the UK took place in 1933 at Seawanhaka Corinthian YC, Oyster Bay, New York and was won (narrowly) by the UK. This, which seems to have been the first recorded international dinghy team racing event, was followed up in 1934 by a second event (four-a-side format from now on) at the Royal Canadian YC, Toronto, when the UK lost just one race - to Canada. After 1934, an international team racing event was held every two years, interrupted by World War II from 1940 to 1958.

In the 1934 event, three of the four UK helmsmen were members of the O&amp;CSS (Stewart Morris - founder of the O&amp;CSS, Peter Scott, John Winter), and the very close relationship between the 14&#x27;s, the O&amp;CSS, and team racing continues. Four-times World Champion, Archie Massey, is a member of the O&amp;CSS, and the Class still holds an international team racing event before its biennial World Championships.

==Other International Class Team Racing==

In 1983 the International Optimist Class (for juniors under 16) introduced team racing at its World Championships, and four-a-side team racing takes place at its national, regional and world championships. At the 2022 World Championship 48 national teams participated with the U.S.A team winning over Ukraine in the final. Since 2008 a separate European Team Racing Championship is held in Ledro for the top sixteen European national teams.

In 2015, after two early events in 2005 and 2006, the International 420 Class initiated a youth (under 21) international team racing championship, separate from its other championships, in three-a-side format.

==National UK Team Racing==

The Wilson Trophy at West Kirby SC has remained the annual pinnacle of team racing in the UK and, to some extent, the world - with teams coming from the United States, Germany, and other countries as team racing interest spread internationally. Team racing interest grew in the UK in the 1970s and early 1980s when the Royal Yachting Association (RYA) organised an inter-club team racing championship. This first National Team Racing competition in Britain and Ireland in 1969 had 260 teams entered, with West Kirby winning the Prince Philip Trophy at Farmoor Reservoir (hosted by Oxford SC). By the next year, 1970, the number of entries increased to 352 clubs. The event divided the country into various zones, with 2 teams from each zone qualifying for a National Final. The competition was sponsored at different times by Little Ship (later British) Paints and Dunhill/Rothmans, and was encouraged by HRH Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, who attended some of the National Finals.

After the event lost its sponsorship in 1982 it ceased for a time, and there was some decline in club interest in team racing in the UK, though not in universities, where it continued to be strong - nor at West Kirby, where the Wilson Trophy continued with unabated enthusiasm. On-the-water umpiring for team racing was pioneered by West Kirby at the 1987 Wilson Trophy, with the first &#x27;On The Water Adjudicators&#x27; being Tony Cross, Ian Berry and Peter Price (West Kirby), Mike Bailey and John Anstey (Wembley), and Brian Heron (Hollingworth Lake). Peter Price went on to write and present the first codified instructions for &quot;On The Water Adjudication for Team Racing&quot; to the RYA in late 1987, and after many years as an Umpire and Chief Umpire was awarded the status of RYA Umpire Emeritus in 2013.

HRH Prince Philip said of the UK Team Racing Championship in 1969: &quot;I very much hope that this new Team Racing Competition will give a lot of enthusiastic clubs and club members many happy hours of sailing. Team racing demands rather a different approach and different techniques, so this event may well discover new talent. It has the further advantage that teams will be able to travel to other clubs and so experience different conditions and new scenery, if only the clubhouse bar. The races are the important thing of course, but I dare say there will be much to discuss afterwards, and I am sure everyone will enjoy the social side of these encounters.&quot;

==National US Team Racing==

In the US, team racing at a national level, outside inter-collegiate competition, was a little slower to develop. The first national team racing championship for the George R. Hinman Trophy was held in 1981 at Fort Worth, Texas and organised by US Sailing. The winning team was from the Great Lakes region (US Sailing Area E): Terry McLaughlin and Carolyn Brodsky, Jeff Boyd and Peter Jones, Tam Matthews and Jay Cross. The event grew out of a regatta initiated by Sailing World magazine that became so popular it was adopted by US Sailing, and the winner of the event is encouraged to enter the Wilson Trophy in the UK.

The early winners tended to be collegiate teams but, through the influence of Gary Brodie who became Chairman of the Team Racing Championship Committee in 1992, and Brad Dellenbaugh who followed him in 1996, the event now attracts a wide entry, though the presence of post-collegiate sailors remains strong - as it does in UK competitions. The first umpired US Team Racing Championship took place in 1990 at Alameda, California.

==International Championships==

In 1995, as a result of widespread international interest, the IYRU - later the ISAF and now World Sailing - introduced the Team Racing World Championships. This made team racing (three-a-side format) a firmly established form of dinghy and yacht racing, though dinghy team racing remains strongest in the English-speaking world. Both Australia and New Zealand have active team racing associations, with local and national competitions. The first (1995) ISAF World Championship was held at West Kirby and won by the UK. Since 2005 the biennial ISAF championship has included a youth (under 19) event, first won by the UK.

==UK Team Racing Championships==

The initiation of the ISAF World Team Racing Championships in 1995 generated greatly increased interest in team racing at the general club level in the UK. The old Prince Philip Trophy from the 1980s was awarded to Spinnaker SC, who won the trials held to select the UK team and went on to win the first World Championship. The trials, the Wilson, and the Worlds were all held at West Kirby that year, with &#x27;world&#x27; teams barred from entering the Wilson. The following year the UK Team Racing Association (UKTRA) was formed. Then, in 1997 the RYA and the UKTRA restarted the UK National Team Racing Championship for the Prince Philip Trophy that had ceased in the early 1980s. The RYA also organises the very popular UK annual Eric Twiname junior (under 16) and youth (under 19) team racing championships. In addition, during almost every week-end of the UK university autumn and winter terms, there are university-organised team racing events, involving between 8 and 16 or more teams.

==UK Schools Team Racing==

UK schools are also active through the British Schools Dinghy Racing Association. The association caters especially for UK private independent schools, organising annual regional and national team racing championships since 1989. The BSDRA was founded by Nick Prosser of Tonbridge, Crispin Reed Wilson of Bradfield, and Bruce Hebbert of Sevenoaks School - who was also a member of the Oxford &amp; Cambridge Sailing Society. Its competitions are open to state schools and internationally. In 1989 Winchester College won the first BSDRA event for the Whitstable Trophy, and Tabor Academy was the first international winner in 1990. This Tabor success was followed by several USA victors, plus Schull Community College from Ireland. The UK National Schools Sailing Association, which caters especially for the state school sector, runs a national single-handed team racing event in Toppers, and a national double-handed team racing event.

The RYA also runs its own Youth team racing nationals known as the Eric Twiname (ETs). The double handed event has two categories. Junior &#x27;two boat&#x27; team racing, which takes place in the RS Feva, and Youth &#x27;3 boat&#x27; team racing which happens in Fireflys. The event normally takes place at Farmoor reservoir, in Oxford. The event has become increasingly popular, with well over 200 participants and 48 team applicants for the two boat team slots. The 2021 nationals, won by RHS (two boat) and Rutland (three boat), had a limit of 24 teams in each of its categories.
==US Team Racing==

There are a good many keel boat and other team racing events in the US, such as the Kirby Cup organised by the Sonar Class Association, and the extensive programme of team racing organised by the New York YC. The CJ Buckley Memorial Regatta is a very popular US annual junior (under 19) Club 420 team racing event, held at East Greenwich. The Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association (ICSA) is active in team racing at the district or &#x27;conference&#x27; level as well as nationally. The Interscholastic Sailing Association (ISSA) has organised an annual national team racing event, for the Baker Trophy since 1989, when Tabor Academy was the winner. The Baker Trophy also involves regional qualifiers.

The US Sailing Team Racing Committee helps promote team racing in the United States. US Sailing also maintains a master schedule of team racing events in the United States.

==European Keel Boat Team Racing==

In 2011 Bruce Hebbert, a member of the Oxford &amp; Cambridge Sailing Society, conceived and launched (with help from a number of sailors in the Netherlands, Germany, Monaco, Italy and Spain) a European series of team racing in keel boats (two-a-side format) called &#x27;2K&#x27;. The series is hotly contested and now takes place in over eight locations across Europe in varying keel boat classes.

==Team Racing Boats==

Because team racing must be conducted in equal boats the most popular boats for team racing are one-design dinghies or keel boats. The 420, Vanguard 15, Firefly, and Flying Junior are the dinghies most frequently used for team racing. The Sonar, J/24, Maxfun 24, and J/80 are popular team racing keel boats.

In the UK the Firefly, a 12-foot dinghy designed by Uffa Fox, is the most commonly used boat. The Firefly is ideal for team racing because it lacks high-performance features such as spinnaker and trapeze that hinder team racing tactics. It also has good acceleration, is highly manoeuvrable, and is easily handled by women and juniors.

==Team Racing Event Formats and Courses==
Early team racing events were generally run on a knock-out basis, with a &#x27;first round losers&#x27; knock-out competition being introduced later. Most current competitions involve either a &#x27;round robin&#x27; or a &#x27;Swiss league&#x27; system to arrive at quarter finalists or semi finalists. The Wilson Trophy preliminary rounds run on a Swiss league basis.

When first introduced, team racing followed the then-current patterns of fleet racing courses, often a large triangle with the same start and finish line. Over time the triangle became smaller to encourage more inter boat action. Later, more inter-boat action was achieved by setting starboard hand courses.

Then the so-called &#x27;S&#x27; (or &#x27;N&#x27;) and the &#x27;box&#x27; course formats evolved. They are explained in the Introduction at the start of this page. The &#x27;S&#x27; format is currently most actively used in Europe.

There is a rumour that the &#x27;S&#x27; course exists due to team racing at Spinnaker sailing club, where race officials had to use their course setting abilities creatively in order to avoid the two islands in the middle of the lake small lake.
== Team Racing Tactics ==

Team racing is a very tactical branch of dinghy racing and yacht racing, combining the need for adequate boat speed with superior handling, good teamwork, and sound understanding of strategies for converting a losing position into a winning one.

Consider the following situation in a 3-boat team race - the most common format. If one boat is in 1st place and its team-mates are in 4th and 6th then the team&#x27;s points are 1 + 4 + 6 = 11 points, whereas the opposition has 2 + 3 + 5 = 10 points and so is ahead. For its team to win the race, the boat in 4th place will have to slow the 5th boat so that its 6th place team-mate moves up to 5th - it would be dangerous for the boat in 1st place to do anything because of the two opposition boats behind. The 4th boat can make its move, called a &#x27;pass back&#x27; conversion, by using the Racing Rules of Sailing (RRS), including the special team racing rules of Appendix D, to position itself in such a way that the opposition has to sail extra distance to keep clear or sail in reduced wind and so lose ground.

There are two main &#x27;moves&#x27; in team racing; the &#x27;pass back&#x27; and the &#x27;mark trap.&#x27; The goal of the pass back, involving three boats sailing upwind, is for the leading boat to slow the next (opposing team&#x27;s) boat in order for the third boat (of the leading boat&#x27;s team) to either tack away from the intermediate covering boat, or sail ahead faster than the covering boat. The mark trap is more complicated. It involves one boat stopping at a mark in a position where it can use the RRS to hinder opposing boats rounding the mark, so allowing team-mates to catch up and then sail ahead. Another tactic is for one boat to gybe onto (right of way) starboard tack when close to a downwind mark, forcing boats just behind to do the same and sail considerable extra distance, and so allow team-mates to catch up.

If one boat feels that another has breached the Racing Rules of Sailing in any situation, she may hail &quot;protest&quot;. If the protested boat does not exonerate herself with a one-turn penalty the protesting boat may hail &quot;umpire&quot; or, more commonly in the UK, show a red flag. An on-the-water umpire will then make a decision, almost instantly, and impose a two-turn penalty on any boat judged to have broken a rule in the incident.
==Winning and Losing Combinations==

An experienced team racer will know whether his team is winning or losing at any point in the race. The most common combinations of results are given below. A good crew will be able to tell the helmsman whether the team is winning or losing and advise which position to attack in order to win.

===2-boat team racing===

Team with the last boat loses.

===3-boat team racing===
The rule for winning is 10 points or less, which translates to the following detailed rules
* 1-2-anything
* 1-3-anything
* 2-3-4
* 2-3-5
* 1-4-5

===4-boat team racing===

The rule for definitely winning is 17 points or less.
In the case of a tie with each team scoring 18 points (e.g., 1,2,7,8 vs 3,4,5,6), the team with first place loses. This reflects the fact that the first (and second) place skippers showed poor strategy by finishing when their team was not winning. &#x27;Last-ditch&#x27; attempts to achieve a winning conversion are to be encouraged!

<text>Pigeon racing is the sport of releasing specially trained homing pigeons, which then return to their homes over a carefully measured distance. The time it takes the animal to cover the specified distance is measured and the bird&#x27;s rate of travel is calculated and compared with all of the other pigeons in the race to determine which animal returned at the highest speed.

Pigeon racing requires a specific breed of pigeon bred for the sport, the Racing Homer. Competing pigeons are specially trained and conditioned for races that vary in distance from approximately to . Despite these lengths, races can be won and lost by seconds, so many different timing and measuring devices have been developed. The traditional timing method involves rubber rings being placed into a specially designed clock, whereas a newer development uses RFID tags to record arrival time.

While there is no definite proof, there are compelling reasons to think the sport of racing pigeons may go back at least as far as 220 AD. It is recorded in the Mishnah that pigeon racers are forbidden from bearing witness. The Sultan of Baghdad set up a pigeon post system in AD 1150, and Genghis Khan used pigeons to carry message to aid his military intelligence. The sport achieved a great deal of popularity in Belgium in the mid-19th century. The pigeon fanciers of Belgium were so taken with the hobby that they began to develop pigeons specially cultivated for fast flight and long endurance called &quot;Voyageurs&quot;. From Belgium the modern version of the sport and the &quot;Voyageurs&quot; which the Flemish fanciers developed spread to most parts of the world. Once quite popular, the sport has experienced a downturn in participants in some parts of the world in recent years, possibly due to the rising cost of living, ageing fanciers, and a severe lack of public interest. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis caused by pigeons is also a reason why some people are leaving the sport.

One recent development in the sport of pigeon racing is &quot;one loft racing&quot;, where birds are raced against each other under the same training regimen, from the same location. The principle being to find the best individual race bird irrespective of the race trainer. This will determine which bird is then the most successful.

==History==

Pigeons are the oldest domesticated bird. The predecessors of modern-day racing pigeons were pigeons bred for their homing ability, primarily to carry messages. &quot;Pigeon posts&quot; have been established all over the world and while mainly used in the military, some are still in service today. Modern pigeon racing originated in Belgium in the mid 19th century. Racing pigeons were first developed in Belgium and England at the same time. They are the result of crossing of a number of other breeds, primarily the Smerle, French Cumulet, English Carrier, Dragoon, and the Horseman (now lost). From the high-flying Cumulet, the Homer received its endurance and its ability to fly for hours on end without tiring. From the Carrier, it inherited the ability to find its way home from great distances.

The sport was aided by several new technologies of the era. The advent of the railroad permitted pigeons to be sent to distant release points quickly and at modest cost. In addition, the creation of mass-produced, sophisticated timing clocks brought accurate and secure timing to the sport. These clocks were designed with special compartments where an entry band, removed from the returning race bird was placed. When struck, the clock recorded the time and also placed the band in a compartment that could only be opened by race officials.

Before electronic communications, such as the telegraph and telephone, Reuters, the world&#x27;s largest news agency, began as a pigeon service carrying closing stock prices between Belgium and Germany, basically between the western and eastern terminus of the telegraph in Europe.

The most expensive pigeon ever sold was &quot;New Kim&quot; which was purchased for $US1.9 million by a bidder from China in November 2020.

==Racing==

Pigeon racing has been described as the &quot;sport with a single starting gate and a thousand finish lines.&quot; In short, competing birds are taken from their lofts and must race home. The time taken and distance are recorded and the fastest bird is declared the winner. Races are generally between and in distance. In the United States flights of up to have been recorded.

Provided it survives the many hazards associated with racing, a single pigeon could compete from about six months of age and still be in competition at over ten years of age. Such feats are uncommon; the average racing career spans three to four years. Hazards can also come from weather conditions on the day of the race. Pigeons can become grounded and disoriented, and therefore not finish the race.

In the early days of racing, paint was used to identify birds for owners. Belgium then developed a brass leg band, that was sent to racers in America to use. Since then, to compete in a race, it must wear a permanent, unique numbered ring or band that is placed on its leg at about five days old. For a race to be conducted, the competing pigeons must be entered into the race, usually at the organisation&#x27;s clubhouse, and taken away from their home to be released at a predetermined time and location. The distance between the bird&#x27;s home loft and the race point is carefully measured by GPS and the time taken by the bird to return is measured using one of the two acceptable timing methods. Sometimes in some leagues, there are two divisions: one for the young birds (usually yearlings in their first year of competition) and another for older birds.

===Traditional timing method===

The traditional method of timing racing pigeons involves rubber rings with unique identification numbers and a specially designed pigeon racing clock. The ring is attached around the bird&#x27;s leg before being sent to race. The serial number is recorded, the clock is set and sealed, and the bird carries the ring home.
When the first bird returns, its trainer removes the ring and places it in a slot in the clock. The time that the ring was placed in the clock is recorded as the official time that the competing bird arrived home. From this time stamp an average speed is measured and a winner of the race can be found.

Although serving its purpose, this method has proved somewhat problematic for a few reasons:
* The pigeon&#x27;s &quot;official time&quot; is not the actual time it arrived; it is the time the ring was removed, placed in the clock and recorded, which could be many vital seconds later.
* Exceptional pigeons may arrive home first on multiple occasions; knowing it is going to have the ring removed speedily, which may be uncomfortable, the pigeon could be reluctant to enter the loft for the trainer.

===Electronic timing method===

The latest development and preferred method for timing racing pigeons is the Electronic Timing System. The bird&#x27;s arrival is recorded automatically. When using an electronic system, the pigeon fancier does not even have to be at the loft to clock the birds as they return. Birds are fitted with a band that has a tiny RFID chip in it which can be read when the bird comes home. At the home loft the electronic scanning records the pigeons&#x27; arrival. The pad or antenna is placed at the entry point to the loft entrance and as the pigeon crosses it the electronic band is scanned. The clock is attached to the antennas. The serial number of the transponder ring is recorded along with the time of arrival. This is very similar to transponder timing systems used in human races.

In February 2008 the members of the Penygraig Homing Society Racing Pigeon Club in Wales won an award to fund a new electronic timing device. The club was able to obtain the device thanks to funding from the All Wales award initiative. Club secretary John Williams said: &quot;The electronic timer certainly makes it a lot easier for us&quot;.

In conjunction with this new way of registering a bird&#x27;s arrival, loft management software packages have been developed in the last 10 years to help fanciers with record keeping, producing pigeon pedigrees, publishing race results or keeping track of treatment and vaccination records.

==One-loft racing==

One-loft racing originated from local futurity races. Futurity races are when the birds race home from the racing station to their homes. The difference between regular racing and futurity races is futurity races has prize money involved. Usually, the prize is used for a bragging right more so than to win the money. The process of racing could be a bit complicated as handlers of their racing pigeons compete with one another. Some handlers could be better than some when it comes down to racing. Therefore, one-loft racing was created. One-loft racing is the process of training birds bred by many different breeders in the same loft, under the same trainer and in the same conditions (as opposed to trainer against trainer in their own lofts and usually with their own birds). It is thought to be the fairest method of proving which bloodline or breeder is best and usually provides the highest amount of prize money. Pigeons are recorded by electronic timing systems scanning the birds as they enter the home loft with winners decided by as little as 100th of a second. The birds are all taken to the same release point and they return to the same home loft, so therefore it is the fastest bird to complete the journey from A to B. One-loft racing is now becoming very popular all around the world with fanciers able to compare their bloodlines on an equal basis against the best breeders.

==Training==

Racing pigeons are housed together in a specially designed dovecote or loft. From about four weeks of age until the end of its racing career, the racing loft is the pigeon&#x27;s home and is where it returns to on race day.

After 22 to 28 days in the nest (depending on the owner&#x27;s preference) the young birds are removed and placed in a section of a large loft or in a smaller loft built for the purpose. After a few days of learning how to locate the water and eating by themselves they are allowed to wander out of the loft and peck around in the garden, while doing this they are constantly observing their surroundings and becoming familiar with them. At about age six to seven weeks the birds will begin taking off, flying in very small circles around their loft and owner&#x27;s house. As their confidence grows they gradually wander farther and farther from home until they are out of sight and can remain so for as much as two hours before returning. When a few trainers fly their pigeons in the same area, these flying &quot;batches&quot; (as flocks of pigeons are called) can number in the thousands. It does not help them much in relation to finding their home from long distances away, a fundamental of pigeon racing. As confident flyers, the young pigeons are taken on progressively longer &#x27;training tosses&#x27;, driven a distance away from their home and released. This method of training is a way to condition the birds mentally and physically to prepare them for the races. This practice of loft flying and tossing continues throughout a pigeon&#x27;s career to keep their homing instincts sharp.

One of the most popular training systems is widowhood. This system uses the birds&#x27; desire to reproduce as motivation to try to give the bird a sense of urgency on race day. The use of widowhood is usually begun by first allowing the racer to raise a baby in their nest box. After the baby is weaned the hen is removed and often the nestbox is closed off, from then on the only time these birds are allowed to see their mate or enter the nest box is upon returning from training or a race. This conditioning is one of the key elements in a lot of racing programmes.

Due to advancements in technology researchers have been able to use small Global Positioning Systems to track the flight paths that their birds follow.

==Hazards==

As pigeon racing takes place over great distances in the sky, instead of on a racetrack, there are many hazards that could befall a pigeon during racing as well as training. The main hazard encountered by racing pigeons is predation by birds of prey. The killing of valuable pigeons by wild predators has led to some pigeon fanciers being suspected and prosecuted of killing birds of prey such as falcons.

Another hazard that racing pigeons encounter is flying into objects they sometimes cannot see, mostly when flying at high speeds or in darker weather conditions. The most common obstructions are electricity pylons or TV aerials. Pigeon fanciers will often have one of their pigeons return home with wounds or missing feathers from the belly or flanks.

It is thought that racing pigeons rely on the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field to find their way home. Some speculation has surfaced indicating that mobile phone towers may be interrupting the birds&#x27; navigation, although no published research has investigated this theory.

==Breeding==
Pigeons are sexually mature at about six months of age. Fanciers will often wait until the pigeon is at least a few months older before breeding. A hen bird will usually only lay two eggs in a clutch, laid every other day, after which incubation begins. The incubation period is 17 days. Pigeon breeders are careful in selecting birds to pair together so as to continue improving the breed and gain a competitive edge. It is this selective breeding that has given rise to the racing pigeons of today, capable of finding their way home from over away and flying at speeds in excess of with a tail wind but average on a calm day. Hens are often capable of laying upwards of 12 eggs per year, and squabs usually leave the nest at approximately three to four weeks of age.

==Doping==
Doping in pigeon racing is the practice of giving performance-enhancing drugs to avian racers. The drugs are used to produce similar effects to those found in human athletes, building up muscle tissue and opening the respiratory tracts. In addition, corticosteroids can be used to delay moulting, allowing a bird to race late into a season.

In October 2013, blood samples from twenty Belgian pigeons were sent by the Pigeon Fanciers Association to South Africa for testing. This was the result of an exchange visit by the association to the National Horseracing Authority of Southern Africa. While tests in Belgium had not found traces of any drugs, the South African laboratory discovered that six samples contained unusual substances. Five samples were found to include traces of acetaminophen (paracetamol), a widely used over-the-counter analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer). The sixth sample was erroneously reported in the press as having shown indications of cocaine use, but the lab reported that it was indications of caffeine usage. As the samples were sent anonymously no action could be taken against the owners of any of the birds.

In 2001 a series of raids across 80 homes led to the confiscation of large quantities of illegal performance-enhancers. Currently, all race winners are tested and over 100 samples were collected and tested in 2013.

In 1995 the Belgian Ministry of Health mandated drug testing in order to protect the welfare of the birds. The sport&#x27;s governing body was looking at the possibility of implementing new anti-doping rules for the sport prior to the commencement of the 2014 season.

==By region==

=== The Americas ===
====Brazil====
The &quot;Brazilian Pigeon Racing Grandprix&quot; is the biggest pigeon race in South America. The Sergipe&#x27;s Pigeon Racing Association and the government from Aracaju organise this event.

====Canada====
The sport of pigeon racing has increased in Canada with Pigeon Clubs and Ladies Auxiliary popping up in cities and towns. The CRPU, the Canadian Racing Pigeon Union, is an organisation that is dedicated to the growth, preservation and support of pigeon racing in Canada.

The Canadian Pigeon International magazine is a monthly publication dedicated to the sport of pigeon racing

====United States====
The sport was introduced into the United States about 1875, although regular racing did not begin until 1878. The sport of pigeon racing is well established in the US, and growing. According to the American Racing Pigeon Union, one of two large accrediting groups, there are 15,000 registered lofts in the U.S.

The sport was banned beginning 1 January 2004 in Chicago, but there have been a number of attempts to amend the ban since then (by making exemptions to the ban for members of a national professional organization). Alderman Gilbert Villegas of the 36th ward introduced the newest legislation June 2018, on behalf of the Polish constituents in his ward, saying the sport is deeply loved in Poland and a number of residents want to reintroduce the sport to Chicago.

Pigeon racing was particularly popular throughout the twentieth century in the New York City area, particularly in Brooklyn/Coney Island and in Hoboken New Jersey, where it still has devotees.

===Asia===
Pigeon racing is becoming increasingly popular in parts of Asia, especially Indonesia, India, China, Pakistan, Iran, Philippines, Japan, Taiwan and Bangladesh. In Bangladesh there are three pigeon racing associations which look after the sport and organize many races. There are thousands of registered pigeon fanciers in Bangladesh. 
Pakistan also has many pigeon clubs. Karachi, Peshawar, Lahore and Sargodha are leading in good quality racing pigeons. 
The heart of the sport in India is Chennai, the capital city of the state of Tamil Nadu.

==== Bangladesh ====
There are over 200 pigeon fanciers in Dhaka, Bangladesh, who race their pigeons outside Cumilla and Chittagong. These two cities have over 100,000 pigeons with this number increasing day by day. Local people are also known to build their own lofts, with some being PIPA agents. These pigeons are directly bought.

==== Taiwan ====
Taiwan has more racing pigeon events than any other country in the world, and can point to between two and three million birds. Nearly 500,000 people race pigeons on the island, and each year, prize money for races reaches the billions of New Taiwan dollars.

===Oceania===

====Australia====
The largest racing organisation in Australia is the Central Cumberland Federation. The state of Queensland also has a number of clubs and organisations. The biggest of these is the Qld Racing Pigeon Federation Inc (QRPF). Located in Brisbane, the QRPF has a long history dating back to the Second World War. Each year the QRPF organises pigeon races for its some 80 members. These races start at approximately in distance and continue on a gradual basis out to distances of over . A specialised transporter is used to transport the birds to the release points. This transporter enables the birds to be fed and watered en route before mass release at a predetermined time for their flight back to various home lofts. Many thousands of pigeons compete in races each weekend during the winter months.

In Western Australia racing is conducted by the Pigeon Racing Federation of Western Australia (Inc) and the West Coast Racing Pigeon Federation (Inc.).

An innovative new one-loft race is the Australian Pigeon Punt Race held in Victoria, Australia.

The sport of pigeon racing has been declining around Sydney with pigeon club members gradually dying off as fewer younger people take up the sport. The high cost of feeds and fuel have also contributed to the decline.

===Europe===
====Belgium====
The Janssen brothers (Louis, Charel, Arjaan and Sjef) were a famous and successful pigeon racing family from Arendonk, Belgium. Louis Janssen, born 1912, was the last-surviving of the famous brothers. He died on 16 April 2013, at the age of 100. Descendants of the brothers&#x27; pigeons can be found racing all around the world.

Another famous and successful pigeon fancier is Karel Meulemans. Karel, born in Retie, also lives in Arendonk.

====Poland====
Pigeon racing in Poland is overseen by &quot;Polski Związek Hodowców Gołębi Pocztowych&quot; (the Polish Association of Mail Pigeon Breeders), which has over 40,000 members. The first local association of pigeon breeders in the Polish lands under occupation was established in 1905 in Zabrze. After Poland regained independence in 1918, several such organisations were established, and in 1926 the first nationwide breeders&#x27; association was established: &quot;Zjednoczenie Polskich Stowarzyszeń Hodowców Gołębi Pocztowych na Rzeczpospolita Polska&quot; (Unification of Polish Mail Pigeon Breeders&#x27; Associations for the Republic of Poland). The breeding of racing pigeons was banned during the Nazi occupation, but after World War II the Polish Pigeon Breeders Union was recreated on 1 April 1946 in Kraków.

====Romania====
Romania is one of Europe&#x27;s hot spots in pigeon racing. Many pigeon breeders join the National Federations every year, triggering more and more competitive challenges. Furthermore, the sport&#x27;s image has changed in the last decade: nowadays it stands for a fine art in Romania, with symbolic prizes and bets. There is a close collaboration with pigeon fanciers from Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany.

In 2019, the Madona National Marathon, a competition organized by Best Pigeons, had the highest number of pigeons ever registered on a Romanian competition: over 19,000 birds and over 1,000 breeders.

====Turkey====
The sport is popular in Turkey. In May 2008 a nine part, pigeon race from the town of Manisa to Erzurum was organised with participants from many pigeon associations across the country.

====UK and Ireland====
The first regular race in Great Britain was in 1881. The British Royal Family first became involved with pigeon racing in 1886 when King Leopold II of Belgium gave them breeding stock. The tradition continued until recently, and a bird of Queen Elizabeth II won a race in 1990. King Charles III recently withdrew from patronage of the sport&#x27;s governing body. The sport is declining in the UK, with membership of recognised clubs and federations falling by about five per cent annually.

The National Flying Club is a British pigeon racing club, and open to anyone in England and Wales.

In the United Kingdom and Ireland, pigeon racing is regulated by six independent organisations:
* Irish Homing Union (IHU)
* North of England Homing Union (NEHU)
* North West Homing Union (NWHU)
* Royal Pigeon Racing Association (RPRA)
* Scottish Homing Union (SHU)
* Welsh Homing Union (WPHU)

In 2007 the British Parliament banned pigeons racing from continental Europe to Britain because of the risk of bird flu. A British MEP supported fanciers to have the ban lifted. Labours MEP Brian Simpson, from Golborne, believed that it was unfair to allow concerns about avian flu to throttle the fanciers&#x27; sport. Simpson said, &quot;But what is clearly apparent now is that pigeon are low-risk in regards to avian flu and the decision to ban continental pigeon racing was wrong.&quot;

Apart from the sport of racing against each other, fanciers also exhibit racing pigeons at organised shows and have a judge decide who has the better bird. British Homing World holds a show each year; all profits from the event are donated to both national and local charities, including Help the Aged and the Association for Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus.

===Africa===

====South Africa====
South Africa is the home of the richest one-loft race in the world, the Million Dollar Pigeon Race. The Million Dollar Pigeon Race involves 4,300 birds from 25 countries with a prize fund of . The runners-up win cars and smaller monetary prizes, while the overall winner receiving . Sun City&#x27;s one-loft race, sees birds from across the world air-freighted to South Africa as squabs, months before the race, and trained to orient to a single loft. Then on race day, after being released out on the South African veldt, the birds all race back to the same destination. The first race was in 1996 and attracted 893 pigeons. The race broke even after five years.

In February 2008 a pigeon fancier paid a South African record for a racing pigeon at auction. The auction, where he bought several other birds, was held after the Sun City Million Dollar Pigeon Race.

<text>Henry Brooks Adams (February 16, 1838 – March 27, 1918) was an American historian and a member of the Adams political family, descended from two U.S. presidents. As a young Harvard graduate, he served as secretary to his father, Charles Francis Adams, Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s ambassador to the United Kingdom. The posting influenced the younger man through the experience of wartime diplomacy, and absorption in English culture, especially the works of John Stuart Mill. After the American Civil War, he became a political journalist who entertained America&#x27;s foremost intellectuals at his homes in Washington and Boston.

During his lifetime, he was best known for &quot;The History of the United States of America 1801–1817&quot;, a nine-volume work, praised for its literary style, command of the documentary evidence, and deep (family) knowledge of the period and its major figures. His posthumously published memoir, &quot;The Education of Henry Adams&quot;, won the Pulitzer Prize and went on to be named by the Modern Library as the best English-language nonfiction book of the 20th century.

==Early life==
He was born in Boston on February 16, 1838, into one of the country&#x27;s most prominent families. His parents were Charles Francis Adams Sr. (1807–1886) and Abigail Brooks (1808–1889). Both his paternal grandfather, John Quincy Adams, and great-grandfather, John Adams, one of the most prominent among the Founding Fathers, had been U.S. Presidents. His maternal grandfather, Peter Chardon Brooks, was one of Massachusetts&#x27; most successful and wealthiest merchants. Another great-grandfather, Nathaniel Gorham, signed the Constitution.
After his graduation from Harvard University in 1858, he embarked on a grand tour of Europe, during which he also attended lectures in civil law at the University of Berlin.

In his 50s, he was initiated into the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity as an honorary member at the 1893 Columbian Exposition by Harris J. Ryan, a judge for the exhibit on electrical engineering. Through that organization, he was a member of the Irving Literary Society.

==During the Civil War==
Adams returned home from Europe in the midst of the heated presidential election of 1860. He tried his hand again at law, taking employment with Judge Horace Gray&#x27;s Boston firm, but this was short-lived.

His father, Charles Francis Adams Sr., was also seeking re-election to the US House of Representatives. After his successful re-election, Charles Francis asked Henry to be his private secretary, continuing a father-son pattern set by John and John Quincy and suggesting that Charles Francis had chosen Henry as the political scion of that generation of the family. Henry shouldered the responsibility reluctantly and with much self-doubt. &quot;[I] had little to do&quot;, he reflected later, &quot;and knew not how to do it rightly.&quot;

During this time, Adams was the anonymous Washington correspondent for Charles Hale&#x27;s &quot;Boston Daily Advertiser&quot;.

=== London (1861–1868) ===
On March 19, 1861, Abraham Lincoln appointed Charles Francis Adams Sr. United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom. Henry accompanied his father to London as his private secretary. He also became the anonymous London correspondent for &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The two Adamses were kept very busy, monitoring Confederate diplomatic intrigues and trying to obstruct the construction of Confederate commerce raiders and blockade runners by British shipyards (see Alabama Claims). Henry&#x27;s writings for the &quot;Times&quot; argued that Americans should be patient with the British. While in Britain, Adams was befriended by many noted men, including Charles Lyell, Francis T. Palgrave, Richard Monckton Milnes, James Milnes Gaskell, and Charles Milnes Gaskell. He worked to introduce the young Henry James to English society, with the help of his closest and lifelong friend Charles Milnes Gaskell and his wife Lady Catherine (&quot;nee&quot; Wallop).

While in Britain, Henry read and was taken with the works of John Stuart Mill. For Adams, Mill&#x27;s 1861 book &quot;Considerations on Representative Government&quot; showed the necessity of an enlightened, moral, and intelligent elite to provide leadership to a government elected by the masses and subject to demagoguery, ignorance, and corruption. Henry wrote to his brother Charles that Mill demonstrated to him that &quot;democracy is still capable of rewarding a conscientious servant.&quot; His years in London led Adams to conclude that he could best provide that knowledgeable and conscientious leadership by working as a correspondent and journalist.

==Return to America==

In 1868, Adams returned to the United States and settled in Washington, DC, where he began working as a journalist. Adams saw himself as a traditionalist longing for the democratic ideal of the 17th and 18th centuries. Accordingly, he was keen on exposing political corruption in his journalism.

=== Harvard professor ===
In 1870, Adams was appointed professor of medieval history at Harvard, a position he held until his early retirement in 1877 at 39. As an academic historian, Adams is considered to have been the first (in 1874–1876) to conduct historical seminar work in the United States. Among his students was Henry Cabot Lodge, who worked closely with Adams as a graduate student.

Adams was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1875.

=== Author ===
Adams&#x27;s &quot;The History of the United States of America (1801 to 1817)&quot; (9 vols., 1889–1891) is a highly detailed history of the Jefferson and Madison administrations with a focus on diplomacy. Wide praise was given for its literary merit, especially the opening five chapters of volume 1, describing the nation in 1800. These chapters have also been criticized; Noble Cunningham states flatly, &quot;Adams misjudged the state of the nation in 1800.&quot; In striving for literary effect, Cunningham argues, Adams ignored the dynamism and sophistication of the new nation. Such arguments aside, historians have long recognized it as a major and permanent monument of American historiography. It has been called &quot;a neglected masterpiece&quot; by Garry Wills, and &quot;a history yet to be replaced&quot; by the great historian C. Vann Woodward.

In the 1880s, Adams wrote two novels, starting with &quot;&quot;, which was published anonymously in 1880 and immediately became popular in literary circles in England and Europe as well as in America. (Only after Adams&#x27;s death did his publisher reveal his authorship.) &quot;Democracy&quot; exposes the corruption of political life in Washington, D.C., building on Adams&#x27; unique insider&#x27;s perspective. His other novel, published under the &quot;nom de plume&quot; of Frances Snow Compton, was &quot;Esther&quot;, whose heroine was believed to be modeled after his wife.

During the late 1860s and early 1870s, Adams edited, with the assistance of his brother Charles Francis Adams, the major American intellectual-literary journal, the &quot;North American Review&quot;. During his tenure it published a number of articles exposing corrupt malpractices in finance, corporations and government, anticipating the work of the &quot;muckrakers&quot; by a generation. The brothers collected several of their most important essays in &quot;Chapters of Erie&quot; (1871). This experience marked the public commencement of Henry Adams&#x27; critical observation of, and radical disenchantment with, the operations and ascendancy of corporations and centralized finance in the economic, social and political life of America. Summarizing the observations of a lifetime, he wrote to his brother Brooks on September 20, 1910 (vol. 6, pp. 369–370, &quot;Letters&quot;, ed. Levenson et al.): &quot;Our system of protection [of industry and commerce]... is fatal to our principles... Railways, trusts, banking-system, manufactures, capital and labor, all rest on the principle of monopoly ... The suggestion that these great corporate organisms, which now perform all the vital functions of our social life, should behave themselves decently, gives away our contention that they have no right to exist. Nor am I prepared to admit that more decency can be attained through a legislature made up of similar people exercising similar illegal powers... From top to bottom the whole system is a fraud... The conviction of having reached this point where we have no choice but to go on in our own rot, drove me out of all share in public affairs twenty years ago.. Every one who has assumed such a share since then has only muddled and made the matter worse.&quot;

In 1884, Adams was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society. In 1892, he received the degree LL.D., from Western Reserve University. In 1894, Adams was elected president of the American Historical Association. His address, entitled &quot;The Tendency of History&quot;, was delivered &quot;in absentia&quot;. The essay predicted the development of a scientific approach to history, but was somewhat ambiguous as to what this achievement might mean.

During the 1890s, Adams exercised a profound and fruitful influence over the thought and writings of his younger brother Brooks. Brooks&#x27; essay, &quot;The Degradation of the Democratic Dogma&quot;, an offshoot of their decades long conversations and correspondence, was published years later.

Adams was an accomplished poet and in later life a friend of young poets—notably George Cabot Lodge and Trumbull Stickney—but published nothing in his lifetime. His important poems &quot;Buddha and Brahma&quot; and &quot;Prayers to the Virgin and the Dynamo&quot; are included (respectively) in the Library of America&#x27;s Nineteenth and Twentieth Century Anthologies, and a half dozen sonnets, a Troubadour translation, and one lyric are scattered through the letters. It is an open question whether the Massachusetts Historical Society or other archives preserve more.

In 1904, Adams privately published a copy of his &quot;Mont Saint Michel and Chartres&quot;, a pastiche of history, travel, and poetry that celebrated the unity of medieval society, especially as represented in the great cathedrals of France. Originally meant as a diversion for his nieces and &quot;nieces-in-wish&quot;, it was publicly released in 1913 at the request of Ralph Adams Cram, an important American architect, and published with support of the American Institute of Architects.

He published &quot;The Education of Henry Adams&quot; in 1907, in a small private edition for selected friends. Only following Adams&#x27;s death was &quot;The Education&quot; made available to the general public, in an edition issued by the Massachusetts Historical Society. It ranked first on the Modern Library&#x27;s 1998 list of 100 Best Nonfiction Books and was named the best book of the 20th century by the Intercollegiate Studies Institute, a conservative organization that promotes classical education. It was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1919.

Some center-right intellectuals view the book critically. Conservative journalist Fred Siegel considered the worldview expressed therein to be rooted in resentment of America&#x27;s middle class. &quot;Henry Adams,&quot; wrote Siegel, &quot;grounded the intellectual&#x27;s alienation from American life in the resentment that superior men feel when they are insufficiently appreciated in America&#x27;s common-man culture.&quot; Others view Adams&#x27;s critique of the commercialism, corruption and pecuniolatry of American mercantile culture as central.

==Personal life==

=== Relations ===
==== Siblings ====
Louisa Catherine Adams Kuhn (1831-1870). Her brother describes her death from tetanus following a carriage accident in Bagni di Lucca, Italy in his Chaos Chapter of &quot;The Education of Henry Adams&quot;. She is buried in Florence&#x27;s &#x27;English&#x27; Cemetery.

John Quincy Adams II (1833–1894) was a graduate of Harvard (1853), practiced law, and was a Democratic member for several terms of the Massachusetts general court. In 1872, he was nominated for vice president by the Democratic faction that refused to support the nomination of Horace Greeley.

Charles Francis Adams Jr. (1835–1915) fought with the Union in the Civil War, receiving in 1865 the brevet of brigadier general in the regular army. He became an authority on railway management as the author of &quot;Railroads, Their Origin and Problems&quot; (1878), and as president of the Union Pacific Railroad from 1884 to 1890. He collaborated with Henry on the editing of The North Atlantic Review and other projects.

Brooks Adams (1848–1927) practiced law and became a writer. His books include &quot;The Gold Standard&quot; (1894), &quot;The Law of Civilization and Decay&quot; (1895), &quot;America&#x27;s Economic Supremacy&quot; (1900), &quot;The New Empire&quot; (1902), &quot;The Theory of Social Revolutions&quot; (1914), and &quot;The Emancipation of Massachusetts&quot; (1919). Henry&#x27;s influence on and involvement with his youngest brother&#x27;s thought and writing was profound and enduring.

=== Social life and friendships ===
Adams was a member of an exclusive circle, a group of friends called the &quot;Five of Hearts&quot; that consisted of Henry, his wife Clover, geologist and mountaineer Clarence King, John Hay (assistant to Lincoln and later Secretary of State), and Hay&#x27;s wife Clara.

One of Adams&#x27;s frequent travel companions was the artist John La Farge, with whom he journeyed to Japan and the South Seas.

From 1885 until 1888, Theodore Frelinghuysen Dwight (1846–1917), the State Department&#x27;s chief librarian, lived with Adams at his home at 1603 H Street in Washington, D.C., where he served as Adams&#x27;s literary assistant, personal secretary, and household manager. Dwight would go on to serve as archivist of the Adams family archives in Quincy, Massachusetts; director of the Boston Public Library; and U.S. Consul at Vevey, Switzerland.

=== Marriage to Marian &quot;Clover&quot; Hooper ===
On June 27, 1872, Adams married Clover Hooper in Beverly, Massachusetts. They spent their honeymoon in Europe, much of it with Charles Milnes Gaskell at Wenlock Abbey, Shropshire. While there, exemplifying the New England civic conscience she and Henry shared, Clover wrote &quot;England is charming for a few families but hopeless for most ... Thank the Lord that the American eagle flaps and screams over us.&quot; Upon their return, Adams went back to his position at Harvard, and their home at 91 Marlborough Street, Boston, became a gathering place for a lively circle of intellectuals. In 1877, his wife and he moved to Washington, DC, where their home on Lafayette Square, across from the White House, again became a dazzling and witty center of social life. He worked as a journalist and continued working as a historian.

==== Her suicide ====
On Sunday morning, December 6, 1885, after a late breakfast at their home, 1607 H Street on Lafayette Square, Clover Hooper Adams went to her room. Henry, troubled by a toothache, had planned to see his dentist. While departing his home, he was met by a woman calling to see his wife. Adams went upstairs to her room to ask if she would receive the visitor and found his wife lying on a rug before the fire; an opened vial of potassium cyanide, which Clover had frequently used in processing photographs, lay nearby. Adams carried his wife to a sofa, then ran for a doctor. Shortly thereafter, Dr. Charles E. Hagner pronounced Clover dead.

Much speculation and numerous theories have been given concerning the causes of Clover Adams&#x27;s suicide. Her death has been attributed to depression over her father&#x27;s death, as well as a family history of mental depression and suicide . Posthumous speculation has been made more difficult by Henry Adams&#x27;s destruction of most of Clover&#x27;s letters and photos following her death. His autobiography maintains a profound silence about his wife after her suicide. Adams&#x27;s grief was profound and enduring. The event was life-shattering for Adams and profoundly altered the course of his life.

Henry, his brother, Charles Francis Adams, Clover&#x27;s brother Edward, and her sister Ellen, with her husband Ephraim Gurney, were the attendees at a brief funeral service held on December 9, 1885, at the house on Lafayette Square. Interment services followed at Rock Creek Cemetery, but the actual burial was postponed until December 11, 1885, because of the inclement weather. A few weeks later, Adams ordered a modest headstone as a temporary marker. Later he commissioned a monument for her tomb from his friend, the sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens, who created a masterpiece for her memorial.

=== Relationship with Elizabeth Sherman Cameron ===
Henry Adams first met Elizabeth Cameron in January 1881 at a reception in the drawing room of the house of John and Clara Hay. Elizabeth was considered to be one of the most beautiful and intelligent women in the Washington area. Elizabeth had grown up as Lizzie Sherman, the daughter of Judge Charles Sherman of Ohio, the niece of Secretary of the Treasury John Sherman in Hayes&#x27;s cabinet, and the niece of General William Tecumseh Sherman. Her family had pressured Lizzie into a loveless marriage with Senator J. Donald Cameron, brokering a prenuptial agreement that provided her with the income from $160,000 worth of securities, a very large amount in 1878, equivalent to about $ million in . The arranged marriage on May 9, 1878, united the reluctant 20-year-old beauty with a 44-year-old widower with six children. Eliza, his eldest, who had served as her father&#x27;s hostess, was now displaced by a stepmother the same age. The children never accepted her. The marriage was further strained by the Senator&#x27;s coarseness and indifference and his fondness for bourbon and the world of political corruption he inhabited, which is reflected in Adams&#x27;s novel &quot;Democracy&quot;.

Henry Adams initiated a correspondence with Lizzie on May 19, 1883, when she and her husband departed for Europe. That letter reflected his unhappiness with her departure and his longing for her return. It was the first of hundreds to follow for the next 35 years, recording a passionate yet unconsummated relationship. On December 7, 1884, one year before Clover&#x27;s suicide, Henry Adams wrote to Lizzie, &quot;I shall dedicate my next poem to you. I shall have you carved over the arch of my stone doorway. I shall publish your volume of extracts with your portrait on the title page. None of these methods can fully express the extent to which I am yours.&quot;

Adams&#x27;s wife, Clover, who had written a weekly letter to her father throughout her marriage except for the brief hiatus during her breakdown along the Nile, never mentioned concerns or suspicions about Henry&#x27;s relationship with Lizzie. Nothing in the letters of her family or circle of friends indicates her distrust or unhappiness with her husband in this matter. Indeed, after her death, Henry found a letter written by Clover to her sister Ellen which had not been mailed. The survival of this letter was assured by its contents which read, &quot;If I had one single point of character or goodness, I would stand on that and grow back to life. Henry is more patient and loving than words can express—God might envy him—he bears and hopes and despairs hour after hour—Henry is beyond all words tenderer and better than all of you even.&quot;

On Christmas Day 1885, Adams sent one of Clover&#x27;s favorite pieces of jewelry to Cameron, requesting that she &quot;sometimes wear it, to remind you of her.&quot;

==Later life==
In late 1885, Adams moved into his newly-completed mansion next door at 1603 H Street, which was designed by Henry Hobson Richardson, an old friend of Adams and one of the most prominent architects of his day. (The house was razed in 1927 and the Hay-Adams Hotel was built on the site.)

Following his wife&#x27;s death, Adams took up a restless life as a globetrotter, traveling extensively, spending summers in Paris and winters in Washington, D.C., where he commissioned the Adams Memorial designed by sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens and architect Stanford White for her grave site in Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington, D.C.

== Death and burial ==
In 1912, Adams suffered a stroke, perhaps brought on by news of the sinking of the , for which he had purchased tickets to return to the U.S. from Europe. After the stroke, his scholarly output diminished, but he continued to travel, write letters, and host dignitaries and friends at his Washington, D.C., home.

In the first volume of her autobiography, Eleanor Roosevelt offers this vignette of Adams in old age: &quot;Occasionally we received one of the much-coveted invitations to lunch or dine at his house... My first picture of this supposedly stern, rather biting Mr. Adams is of an old gentleman in a victoria outside of our house on N Street. [His secretary] Aileen Tone and I were having tea inside, but Mr. Adams never paid calls. He did, however, request that the children of the house come out and join him in the victoria; ... and they brought their Scottie dog and sat and chatted and played all over the vehicle. No one was ever able thereafter to persuade me that Mr. Adams was quite the cynic he was supposed to be. One day after lunch with him, my husband [the future President] mentioned something which at the time was causing him deep concern in the Government, and Mr. Adams looked at him rather fiercely and said: &#x27;Young man, I have lived in this house many years and seen the occupants of that White House across the square come and go, and nothing that you minor officials or the occupant of that house can do will affect the history of the world for long!&#x27; ... Henry Adams loved to shock his hearers, and I think he knew that those who were worth their salt would understand him and pick out of the knowledge which flowed from his lips the things which might be useful, and discard the cynicism as an old man&#x27;s defense against his own urge to be [still] an active factor in the work of the world.&quot;

On March 27, 1918, Adams died in Washington, D.C., at age 80. He was interred beside his wife in Rock Creek Cemetery, Washington, D.C.

==Views==

===Anglo-Saxonism===
Considered a prominent Anglo-Saxonist of particularly the nineteenth-century, Adams has been portrayed by modern historians as anxious about the immigration of the era into the United States, particularly from Eastern Europe. More starkly put, Adams also wrote of his belief that &quot;the dark races are gaining on us&quot;. He considered the U.S. Constitution itself as belonging to the Anglo-Saxon &quot;race&quot;, and as an expression of &quot;Germanic freedom&quot;. He went so far as to criticize fellow scholars for not being absolute enough in their Anglo-Saxonism, such as William Stubbs, whom he criticized for downplaying the significance, as he saw it, of &quot;Germanic law&quot; or hundred law in its contribution to English common law.

Adams was nevertheless highly critical of the English. He referred to them as a &quot;besotted race&quot; from whom nothing good could come and &quot;wanted nothing so much as to wipe England off the earth.&quot;

===Antisemitism===
Adams&#x27;s attitude towards Jews has been described as one of loathing. John Hay said that when Adams &quot;saw Vesuvius reddening ... [he] searched for a Jew stoking the fire.&quot;

Adams wrote: &quot;I detest [the Jews], and everything connected with them, and I live only and solely with the hope of seeing their demise, with all their accursed Judaism. I want to see all the lenders at interest taken out and executed.&quot; To one friend, he wrote: &quot;Bombard New York. I know no place that would be more improved by it. The chief population is Jew, and the rest is German Jew.&quot;

His letters were &quot;peppered with a variety of antisemitic remarks&quot;, according to historian Robert Michael, as in the following citations from historian Edward Saveth:

&quot;We are in the hands of the Jews&quot;, Adams lamented. &quot;They can do what they please with our values.&quot; He advised against investment except in the form of gold locked in a safe deposit box. &quot;There you have no risk but the burglar. In any other form you have the burglar, the Jew, the Czar, the socialist, and, above all, the total irremediable, radical rottenness of our whole social, industrial, financial and political system.&quot; 

Edward Chalfant&#x27;s definitive three-volume biography of Adams includes an exhaustive, well-documented examination of Adams&#x27;s &quot;antisemitism&quot; in its second volume, &quot;Improvement of the World&quot;. He shows that most of the time when Adams says &quot;Jews&quot; he means &quot;financiers.&quot; This accords with the historical English usage referenced by the second definition under the Oxford English Dictionary entry, a usage that was common in Adams&#x27;s time and social milieu. It also accords with Adams&#x27;s frequent laments that &quot;the eighteenth-century fabric of a priori, or moral, principles&quot; had been replaced with &quot;a bankers&#x27; world&quot; and that the &quot;banking mind was obnoxious&quot;.

Adams esteemed individual Jewish personages. In the &quot;Dilettantism&quot; chapter of &quot;The Education of Henry Adams&quot; he wrote of historian Francis Palgrave that &quot;the reason of his superiority lay in his name, which was Cohen, and his mind which was Cohen also&quot;. (Palgrave, the son of a Jewish stockbroker, had changed his name from Cohen upon marriage.) In the &quot;Political Morality&quot; chapter of the same volume he praises the Jewish statesman Benjamin Disraeli over the Gentiles Palmerston, Russell and Gladstone, writing: &quot;Complex these gentlemen were not. Disraeli alone might, by contrast, be called complex.&quot;

=== Historical entropy ===

In 1910, Adams printed and distributed to university libraries and history professors the small volume &quot;A Letter to American Teachers of History&quot; proposing a &quot;theory of history&quot; based on the second law of thermodynamics and the principle of entropy. This, essentially, states that all energy dissipates, order becomes disorder, and the earth will eventually become uninhabitable. In short, he applied the physics of dynamical systems of Rudolf Clausius, Hermann von Helmholtz, and William Thomson to the modeling of human history.

In his 1909 manuscript &quot;The Rule of Phase Applied to History&quot;, Adams attempted to use Maxwell&#x27;s demon as a historical metaphor, though he seems to have misunderstood and misapplied the principle. Adams interpreted history as a process moving towards &quot;equilibrium&quot;, but he saw militaristic nations (he felt Germany pre-eminent in this class) as tending to reverse this process, a &quot;Maxwell&#x27;s Demon of history&quot;.

Adams made many attempts to respond to the criticism of his formulation from his scientific colleagues, but the work remained incomplete at Adams&#x27;s death in 1918. It was published posthumously.

=== Robert E. Lee ===
Adams said, &quot;I think that Lee should have been hanged. It was all the worse that he was a good man and a fine character and acted conscientiously. It&#x27;s always the good men who do the most harm in the world.&quot;

=== The Virgin Mary ===
In &quot;Mont Saint-Michel and Chartres&quot;, Adams argues that the previous nineteen hundred years of civilization dating from the birth of Christ had been dominated by the feminine, fertile image of the Blessed Virgin, and that the industrial &quot;dynamo&quot; was a masculine, destructive force which would upend history.

<doc id="233935" wikidata="Q644474" url="?curid=233935" title="Pipe bomb">
<text>A pipe bomb is an improvised explosive device (IED) that uses a tightly sealed section of pipe filled with an explosive material. The containment provided by the pipe means that simple low explosives can be used to produce a relatively large explosion due to the containment causing increased pressure. The fragmentation of the pipe itself creates potentially lethal shrapnel.

Premature detonation is a hazard of attempting to construct any homemade bomb. The materials and methods used with pipe bombs often result in unintentional detonation, usually resulting in serious injury or death to the assembler.

In many countries, the manufacture or possession of a pipe bomb is a serious crime, regardless of its intended use.

==Design==

The bomb is usually a short section of steel water pipe containing the explosive mixture and closed at both ends with steel or brass caps. A fuse is inserted into the pipe with a lead running out through a hole in the side or capped end of the pipe. The fuse can be electric, with wires leading to a timer and battery, or can be a common fuse. All of the components are easily obtainable. 

Generally, high explosives such as trinitrotoluene are not used, because these and the detonators that they require are difficult for non-state users to obtain. Such explosives also do not require the containment design of a pipe bomb. 

Instead, explosive mixtures that the builder can more readily obtain themselves are used, such as gunpowder, match heads, or chlorate mixtures. These can be easily ignited by friction, static electricity, and sparks generated when packing the material inside the tube or attaching the end caps, causing many injuries or deaths amongst builders. 

Sharp objects such as nails or broken glass are sometimes added to the outer shell or inside of the bomb to increase the lethality of the device.

==Operation==
Pipe bombs concentrate pressure and release it suddenly, through the failure of the outer casing. Plastic materials can be used, but metals typically have a much higher bursting strength and so will produce more concussive force. For example, common schedule 40 wrought steel pipe has a typical working pressure of , and bursting pressure of , though the pipe sealing method can significantly reduce the burst pressure.

The pipe can rupture in different ways, depending on the rate of pressure rise and the ductility of the casing material.
*If the pressure rise is slow, the metal can deform until the walls become thin and a hole is formed, causing a loud report from the gas release, but no shrapnel.
*A rapid rate of pressure rise will cause the metal to shatter into fragments, which are pushed outward in all directions by the expanding gases.

==Modes of failure==
Pipe bombs can fail to explode if the gas pressure buildup is too slow, resulting in bleed-out through the detonator ignition hole. Insufficiently tight threading can also bleed gas pressure through the threads faster than the chemical reaction pressure can rise.

They can also fail if the pipe is fully sealed and the chemical reaction triggered, but the total pressure buildup from the chemicals is insufficient to exceed the casing strength; such a bomb inevitably fails to trigger, but is still potentially dangerous if handled, since an external shock could trigger rupture of the statically pressurized casing.

==Minimum evacuation distances==
If any type of bomb is suspected, typical recommendations are to keep all people at a minimum evacuation distance until authorized bomb disposal personnel arrive. For a pipe bomb, the US Department of Homeland Security recommends a minimum of , and an outdoors distance of .

==Uses==
Pipe bombs are by nature improvised weapons and typically used by those without access to military devices such as grenades. They were successfully used in the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939). During World War II, members of the British Home Guard were trained to make and use them.

In Northern Ireland, there have been hundreds of pipe bomb attacks since the mid-1990s as the Troubles came to an end. Most of the attacks have been launched by loyalist paramilitaries, especially the Red Hand Defenders, Orange Volunteers and Ulster Defence Association. However, they have also been used by Irish republican paramilitaries and by anti-drugs vigilante group Republican Action Against Drugs. They are also used extensively in the south of Ireland by feuding criminals, including drug dealers, mainly in the capital city of Dublin.

As well as users such as criminals, paramilitaries, and militias, they also have a long tradition of recreational use for amusement or mischief with no intention to cause injury to anyone, but due to the dangers of premature ignition and of shrapnel, pipe bombs are much more dangerous than alternatives, such as dry ice bombs or potato cannons.

===Notable incidents===

*On 4 May 1886, a pipe bomb was thrown during a rally at Haymarket Square in Chicago, Illinois, United States. It reached a police line and exploded, killing policeman Mathias J. Degan. The bomb was made from gas-pipe filled with dynamite and capped at both ends with wooden blocks.
*From August 1977 to November 1977 Allan Steen Kristensen planted several bombs across Copenhagen, Denmark injuring 5.
* In 1985, Palestinian American anti-discrimination activist Alex Odeh was killed in California by a pipe-bomb. Activists from the Jewish Defense League are suspected of being the bombers.
*On 16 December 1989, Federal Judge Robert Vance was assassinated in his home in Mountain Brook, Alabama when he opened a package that contained a pipe bomb mailed by Walter Leroy Moody in Mountain Brook, Alabama.
*On 27 July 1996, Eric Rudolph used a pipe bomb in the Centennial Olympic Park bombing during the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. It killed two people and injured 111.
*During the preparation of the Columbine High School Massacre, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold had experimented with pipe bombs. During their testing and experimentation, Eric Harris had posted their results on his website. During the massacre, Harris and Klebold had used their pipe bombs as makeshift hand grenades, alongside various other bombs they had crudely manufactured.
*On 11 December 2010 a suicide bomber detonated one out of six pipe bombs close to a major shopping district in Stockholm, Sweden, killing himself with no other casualties in what is known as the 2010 Stockholm bombings.
*In October 2018, pipe bombs without triggering devices were sent to various liberal and political figures in the United States. Recipients included political activist and investor George Soros, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, former President Barack Obama, former CIA director John Brennan, and former attorney general Eric Holder.
*On 6 January 2021, a pipe bomb was found at the headquarters of the Republican National Committee, during the certification of President-elect Joe Biden. An unidentified object was also found at the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee, resulting in an evacuation.
*Ted Kaczynski, is known to have used pipe bombs in most of his bombings from 1978 to 1996.
