<text>The northern bald ibis, hermit ibis, or Waldrapp (Geronticus eremita) is a migratory Old World ibis found in open areas such as grasslands, rocky mountains, and semi-deserts, often close to running water. This glossy black ibis, which, unlike many members of the ibis family, is non-wading, has an unfeathered red face and head, and a long, curved red bill. It breeds colonially on coastal or mountain cliff ledges, where it typically lays two to three eggs in a stick nest, and feeds on lizards, insects, and other small animals.

The northern bald ibis was once widespread across the Middle East, northern Africa, southern and central Europe, with a fossil record dating back at least 1.8 million years. It disappeared from Europe over 300 years ago, although reintroduction programmes in the region are underway. In 2019 there were about 700 wild birds remaining in southern Morocco, and fewer than 10 in Syria, where it was rediscovered in 2002 but where their number declined in the following years, maybe to zero.

To combat these low numbers, reintroduction programs have been instituted internationally in recent times, with a semi-wild breeding colony in Turkey which counted almost 250 birds in 2018 as well as sites in Austria, Italy, Spain, and northern Morocco. These programmes and the natural growth in Morocco from about 200 birds in the 1990s helped to downlist the northern bald ibis from Critically Endangered to Endangered on the IUCN Red List in 2018. There are about 2000 northern bald ibises living in captivity.

The long-term decline in Europe has been linked to hunting and eating them, especially the fledglings. The slow reproduction means this can cause local extinction.

== Taxonomy ==
The ibises are gregarious, long-legged wading birds with long down-curved bills. Along with the spoonbills they form one subfamily within the family Threskiornithidae. The northern bald ibis&#x27; closest relative, and the only other member of the genus, is the southern bald ibis, &quot;G. calvus&quot;, of southern Africa. The two &quot;Geronticus&quot; species differ from other ibises in that they have unfeathered faces and heads, breed on cliffs rather than in trees, and prefer arid habitats to the wetlands used by their relatives.

The northern bald ibis was described and illustrated by Swiss naturalist Conrad Gesner in his &quot;Historiae animalium&quot; in 1555, and given the binomial name &quot;Upupa eremita&quot; by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. It was moved to its current genus by the German herpetologist Johann Georg Wagler in 1832. This species has an interesting history of description, oblivion and rediscovery.

The species probably split into two distinct populations at least 400 years ago and, since then, the two populations have been diverging morphologically, ecologically, and genetically; nevertheless, the Turkish and Moroccan populations of this ibis are not currently classed as separate subspecies. One consistent difference between the eastern and western birds is a single mutation in the cytochrome b gene of their mitochondrial DNA.

Fossils of the northern bald ibis have been found at a Holocene (c. 10,000 years ago) site in southern France, in middle Pleistocene (c. 900,000 years ago) strata in Sicily, and in Pliocene-Pleistocene boundary (c. 1.8 million years ago) deposits on the Mediterranean coast of Spain. What appears to be an ancestral form, &quot;Geronticus balcanicus&quot;, was found in the late Pliocene of Bulgaria, further illustrating the early widespread presence of this genus in Europe, and suggesting that &quot;Geronticus eremita&quot; may have originated in southeastern Europe or the Middle East.

==Etymology==
The genus name, &quot;Geronticus&quot;, is derived from the Ancient Greek : gérōn, meaning &quot;old man&quot; and refers to the bald head of the aged. The species name &quot;eremita&quot; is Late Latin for &quot;hermit&quot;, from the : erēmía, meaning &quot;desert&quot;, and refers to the arid habitats inhabited by this species. The alternative common name &quot;Waldrapp&quot; is German for &quot;forest raven&quot;, the equivalent of the Latin &quot;Corvo sylvatico&quot; of Gesner, adapted as &quot;Corvus sylvaticus&quot; by Linnaeus.

== Description ==

The northern bald ibis is a large, glossy black bird, long with a wingspan and an average weight of . The plumage is black, with bronze-green and violet iridescence, and there is a wispy ruff on the bird&#x27;s hind neck. The face and head are dull red and unfeathered, and the long, curved bill and the legs are red. In flight, this bird has powerful, shallow, and flexible wing beats. It gives guttural &quot;hrump&quot; and high, hoarse &quot;hyoh&quot; calls at its breeding colonies, but is otherwise silent.

The sexes are similar in plumage, although males are generally larger than females, and, as with other ibises that breed in colonies, have longer bills. The longer-billed males are more successful in attracting a mate. The downy chick has uniformly pale brown plumage, and the fledged juvenile resembles the adult except that it has a dark head, light grey legs, and a pale bill. The unfeathered areas of the young bird&#x27;s head and neck gradually become red as it matures. Moroccan birds have a significantly longer bill than Turkish birds of the same sex.
If the eastern and western populations are considered to be separable subspecies, it is unclear which should be considered to be the nominate (first-named) form, since the first description of this species was based on a now-extinct population from Switzerland which is of unknown race.

The northern bald ibis is readily distinguished from its close relative, the southern bald ibis of Southern Africa, by the southern species&#x27; whitish face. The northern bald can also be confused with the similarly dark-plumaged glossy ibis, which overlaps its range, but it is larger and stockier than that species. In flight, when the bill and face colouration may not be visible, the bald ibis&#x27; less rounded wings and shorter neck give it a different profile from glossy ibis, and its relatively short legs mean that its feet do not project beyond the tail, unlike those of the glossy ibis.

== Habitat and range ==

Unlike many other ibises, which nest in trees and feed in wetlands, the northern bald ibis breeds on undisturbed cliff ledges, and forages for food in irregularly cultivated, grazed dry areas such as semi-arid steppes, and fallow fields. The close proximity of adequate steppe feeding areas to breeding cliffs is an important habitat requirement.

The northern bald ibis was once widespread across the Middle East, northern Africa, and southern and central Europe; fossil bones have been found at Solothurn dated to the Mesolithic and Neolithic Periods. It bred along the Danube and Rhone Rivers, and in the mountains of Spain, Italy, Germany, Austria and Switzerland (Gesner&#x27;s original description was of a Swiss bird), and most probably also in the Upper Adriatic region. It used castle battlements as well as cliff ledges for nesting before vanishing from Europe at least three centuries ago. It is also extinct over most of its former range, and now almost the entirety of the wild breeding population of just over 500 birds is in Morocco, at Souss-Massa National Park, where there are three documented colonies, and near the mouth of the Oued Tamri (north of Agadir), where there is a single colony containing almost half the Moroccan breeding population. There is some movement of birds between these two sites.

Religious traditions helped this species to survive in one Turkish colony long after the species had disappeared from Europe, since it was believed that the ibis migrated each year to guide Hajj pilgrims to Mecca. The ibis was protected by its religious significance, and a festival was held annually to celebrate its return north. The Turkish ibis population was centred near the small town of Birecik in the southeast of the country, and during the first half of the 20th century, the Birecik colony maintained a relatively stable population of about 500 breeding pairs, reaching an estimated total population of about 3,000 around 1930. By the 1970s, numbers had drastically declined and a captive breeding program was initiated in 1977 with one adult pair and nine chicks taken from the wild. This program largely failed to revert the decline; there were 400 birds in 1982, five pairs in 1986, and seven pairs in 1987. Only three birds returned from their wintering grounds in 1989, and just one in 1990. The returning birds died before they could reproduce, thus rendering the species extinct in the wild in Turkey as of 1992. Once the wild Turkish population became non-viable, the colony was maintained as a flock which was free-flying for most of the year but caged in autumn to prevent migration.

After the demise of the migratory Turkish colony, the northern bald ibis was known to survive in the wild only at the Moroccan sites, although occasional sightings of birds in Yemen, Eritrea, Saudi Arabia, and Israel during the 1980s and 1990s suggested that there was still a colony somewhere in the Middle East. Intensive field surveys in spring 2002, based on the knowledge of Bedouin nomads and local hunters, revealed that the species had never become completely extinct on the Syrian desert steppes. Following systematic searches, 15 old nesting sites were found, one, near Palmyra, was still hosting an active breeding colony of seven individuals. Although the ibis had been declared extinct in Syria more than 70 years earlier, the bird appears to have been relatively common in the desert areas until 20 years ago, when a combination of overexploitation of its range lands and increasing hunting pressures initiated a dramatic decline.

The Moroccan breeding birds are resident, dispersing along the coast after the nesting season. It has been suggested that coastal fog provides extra moisture for this population, and enables the ibises to remain year-round. In the rest of its former range, away from the Moroccan coastal locations, the northern bald ibis migrated south for the winter, and formerly occurred as a vagrant to Spain, Iraq, Egypt, the Azores, and Cape Verde.
Satellite tagging of 13 Syrian birds in 2006 showed that the three adults in the group, plus a fourth untagged adult, wintered together from February to July in the highlands of Ethiopia, where the species had not been recorded for nearly 30 years. They travelled south on the eastern side of the Red Sea via Saudi Arabia and Yemen, and returned north through Sudan and Eritrea.

== Behaviour ==
=== Breeding ===

The northern bald ibis breeds in loosely spaced colonies, nesting on cliff ledges or amongst boulders on steep slopes, usually on the coast or near a river. Volunteer climbers have created extra ledge spaces in the Souss-Massa colonies to ensure that breeding population is not limited by the availability of nest ledges, and artificial nest boxes are used in the managed colony at Birecik. In the past, the birds also nested in buildings.

This ibis starts breeding at three to five years of age, and pairs for life. The male chooses a nest site, cleans it, and then advertises for a female by waving his crest and giving low rumbling calls. Once the birds have paired, the bond is reinforced through bowing displays and mutual preening. The nest is a loose construction of twigs lined with grass or straw. &quot;G. eremita&quot; normally lays two to four rough-surfaced eggs, which weigh an average of , and are initially blue-white with brown spots, becoming brown during incubation. An egg in the collection of the British Museum was marked more thickly at the broad end, with &quot;spots and very small blotches of yellowish brown and pale rufous&quot;. It was 0.93 in long and 0.68 in wide (2.37 × 1.73 cm). The clutch is incubated for 24–25 days to hatching, the chicks fledge in another 40–50 days, and the first flight takes place at about two months. Both parents incubate and feed the chicks.

The northern bald ibis lives for an average of 20 to 25 years in captivity (oldest recorded male 37 years, oldest recorded female 30 years). The average age in the wild has been estimated as 10 to 15 years.

=== Feeding ===

This gregarious species commutes in flocks from the cliff breeding sites or winter roosts to its feeding areas, flying in a V formation. The flocks may contain up to 100 birds in winter. During the breeding season, the ibises regularly forage up to from the colony, and, although steppe not in current cultivation is preferred for feeding, they will also use fallow ground, and occasionally even actively cultivated fields.

The northern bald ibis consumes a very wide variety of mainly animal food; faecal analysis of the Moroccan breeding population has shown that lizards and tenebrionid beetles predominate in the diet, although small mammals, ground-nesting birds, and invertebrates such as snails, scorpions, spiders, and caterpillars are also taken. Males will sometimes &quot;scrounge&quot; food from females. As the flock moves across the ground, the ibis uses its long bill to feel for food items in the loose, sandy soil. Since this bird hunts mainly by probing, a soft surface seems to be vital, and it is important that any vegetation is sparse, and not more than high.

== Conservation status ==

Although the northern bald ibis was long extinct in Europe, many colonies in Morocco and Algeria survived until the early 20th century, when they began to decline more rapidly, the last colony in Algeria disappearing in the late 1980s. In Morocco there were about 38 colonies in 1940 and 15 in 1975, but the last migratory populations in the Atlas Mountains had vanished by 1989. The species is endangered according to the IUCN scale, with an estimated population in 2018 of around 147 breeding pairs in the wild and over 1,000 in captivity. It was formerly considered critically endangered until heavy conservation action secured the breeding sites in Morocco and even allowed the birds to expand to other sites, as well as the semi-wild population conserved in Turkey as well as the reintroduction projects in Europe. The northern bald ibis is one of the key species to which the draft &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies, and it has a detailed, internationally agreed conservation action plan under the agreement. As a species that is threatened with extinction, it is listed on Appendix 1 of CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora), which means that commercial trade in the species (including parts and derivatives) is prohibited.

The northern bald ibis has declined for several centuries, at least partly as a consequence of unidentified natural causes. The more rapid decline in the past hundred years, with a loss of 98% of the population between 1900 and 2002, is the result of a combination of factors. These include significant human persecution, especially hunting, and also the loss of steppe and non-intensive agricultural areas (particularly in Morocco), pesticide poisoning, disturbance, and dam construction. The discovery in Jordan of three dead adults from the Turkish colony seemed to confirm that the overuse of pesticides is still a cause of death on migration. These birds were tracked by satellite after leaving Birecik; they stopped off briefly at the Syrian colony, and were later found dead in the Jordanian desert. Although the cause of death was initially thought to have been from poison, probably laid by chicken farmers to kill rodents, the autopsy revealed that they had actually been
electrocuted whilst standing on electricity pylons.

=== Wild populations ===
====Morocco====
Monitoring of Moroccan wild population is guaranteed by BirdLife International partners, especially by RSPB, SEO/BirdLife and, recently GREPOM in cooperation with Souss-Massa National Park administration and the support of institutions like Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation which is the Species Champion for Northern Bald Ibis. For the first time in the species&#x27; recorded history, there is now evidence of population growth in the wild, and the population in Morocco increased to 100 breeding pairs in the decade prior to 2008 and reached a record of 113 breeding pairs in 2013. Simple site and species protection has facilitated this growth. Quantitative assessments of the importance of sites for breeding, roosting, and foraging have guided actions to prevent disturbance and the loss of key areas to mass tourism development. Wardening by members of the local community has reduced human intrusion and increased the perceived value of the birds. The provision of drinking water and the removal and deterrence of predators and competitors enhances breeding prospects, and monitoring has confirmed that steppe and two-year fallows are key feeding habitats. 
In early 2019 the total population in the two colonies of Souss-Massa National Park and Tamri reached 708 birds after 147 breeding pairs that laid eggs have produced 170 chicks in the last breeding season.

Maintaining such non-intensive land uses in the future may present major management challenges, and the recovery in the Souss-Massa region remains precarious because the population is concentrated in just a few places. However, it could provide opportunities for natural extension of the range to formerly occupied sites further north in Morocco.
The main cause of breeding failure at the Souss-Massa National Park is the loss of eggs to predators, especially the common raven which nest monitoring has shown to have had a serious impact at one sub-colony. The effects of predators on adult birds have not been studied, but the very similar southern bald ibis, &quot;Geronticus calvus&quot;, is hunted by large raptors, particularly those that share its breeding cliffs. There is evidence of chick starvation in some years, but the main threats to breeding birds are human disturbance and the loss of feeding habitat. There was a dramatic mortality incident at the Moroccan colonies in May 1996, when 40 adults died or disappeared over a period of nine days. Although analyses have not identified the cause, an obscure virus, a toxin, or botulism are thought to be the most likely causes of the deaths.

====Syria====
Conservation efforts for the northern bald ibis in Syria began with the discovery of an unreported relict colony of this species in early 2002 in the Palmyra desert. The bald ibises still breeding in Syria, discovered during an extensive biodiversity survey carried out as part of a FAO cooperation project, are the last living descendants of those depicted in Egyptian hieroglyphs from 4500 years ago. The discovery was made possible through the use of traditional ecological knowledge of the Bedouin nomads.

Following the discovery in Syria, a successful community-based ibis breeding intensive protection program was established in Palmyra during years 2002–2004, in parallel with an extensive capacity building program in the benefit of the local community and staff from the Syrian Steppe Commission. Fourteen chicks successfully fledged during this period.

Beside protection and training operations, data on threats and on feeding and breeding ecology were collected in the field. An Ibis Protected Area was recommended and established, and an awareness and education program was also launched and successfully implemented.
Two breeding failures were recorded in 2005 and 2008 following a change of project management and of ibis protection strategy, that occurred between 2004 and 2005. Three birds were tagged with satellite tags and the migratory route and wintering site of the colony were discovered in 2006. Three surveys were undertaken at the wintering site on the Ethiopian highlands between 2006 and 2009, establishing that no immediate threats were present at the site.
Thanks to an IUCN project the Ibis Protected Area in Palmyra desert was further developed in 2008–2009, addressing the threats of infrastructure proliferation and oil company heavy prospection schemes.

Meanwhile, it became apparent that only adults were reaching the wintering site in Ethiopia and that it was the low survival rate of immature birds - and thus an insufficient recruitment at the breeding colony in Palmyra - that was causing the slow and steady decline of the colony from 3 breeding pairs in 2002 to just 1 in 2010. Satellite tracking and surveys conducted in western Saudi Arabia during 2009–2010, with key cooperation of the Saudi Wildlife Authority, suggested that a combination of hunting and electrocution were causing a high mortality of dispersing immature ibises. This mortality is currently regarded as the main cause of the low recruitment occurred at the Palmyra colony during the years following the high breeding performance of period 2002–2004 (only 3 recruitment events out of 14 chicks fledged).

A supplementation trial could be eventually conducted in 2010 by introducing captive-born chicks into the wild colony in Palmyra. For this aim, a first captive breeding center was established in Palmyra. Three chicks introduced at the wild colony in Palmyra followed a migrating wild adult for more than 1000 km from Palmyra well into southwest Saudi Arabia.

The success of the trial, unique of its kind, reinvigorated the hopes that the colony could be still saved. Conservation efforts were interrupted in March 2011 due to the worsening of the political situation in Syria. Palmyra trained rangers have reportedly continued to protect the breeding birds even during the subsequent years. The last year a lone bird was seen returning to Palmyra is 2014 (it returned alone also in 2013). In 2015 no birds came back. As of 2017, some birds are still seen at the wintering grounds.

==== Turkey ====
With the loss of the genuinely wild Turkish population, the Ministry of Environment and Forestry&#x27;s Directorate of Natural Preservation and National Parks established a new semi-wild colony at Birecik. This was heavily managed, with birds taken into captivity after the breeding season to prevent migration. The program was successful, with numbers at 205 as of March 2016. The intent is to allow the birds to migrate once the population reaches a stable 100 pairs, excluding young.

The birds are released in late January or early February to breed outside the cages on ledges and, mainly, in the nest boxes in the breeding station compound. The ibises are free flying and forage around the Birecik area in forest nurseries, agricultural fields, and along the Euphrates, but supplementary food is also provided. Following the end of the breeding season, the birds are taken into cages in late July or early August to prevent migration. A trial migration using tagged birds confirmed the risks presented to travelling birds by pesticides. Later on the Syrian Civil War added one more reason to keep preventing migration.

=== Reintroductions ===

The guidelines for the conservation and reintroduction of the northern bald ibis were established in 2003 at an International Advisory Group for Northern Bald Ibis (IAGNBI) conference in Innsbruck at the Alpenzoo, which maintains the European studbook for the northern bald ibis.

Decisions taken at the meeting included:
* There should be no augmenting of the wild populations at Souss-Massa or in Palmyra using zoo-bred ibises.
* There are two distinctive populations of northern bald ibis, and the separate ranges of the eastern and western forms should be respected.
* In order to prepare birds for release, groups of chicks should be hand-reared by human &quot;parents&quot;.
* Migration routes and stop-over points will have to be taught to young birds, since it is unlikely that they will discover this information by themselves.

A second conference in Spain in 2006 stressed the need to survey potential and former sites in north-west Africa and the Middle East for currently undetected colonies. The need to raise the standards of hygiene and husbandry in the Birecik aviaries was reiterated, and the prevalence of skin problems in a number of zoos reinforced the view that no zoo birds should be used for any free-flying trials. In future captive breeding and releasing programmes, only birds of known origin should be used.

==== Zoo populations ====

There are 850 northern bald ibises in European zoos and a further 250 in captivity in Japan and North America. The 49 European zoos keeping this species produce 80 to 100 young birds per year, and earlier attempts at releasing captive-bred birds included close to 150 birds between 1976 and 1986 from an aviary at Birecik, 75 from Tel Aviv Zoo in 1983, and an unspecified number from a project in Almería, Spain, from 1991 to 1994; all these attempts were unsuccessful. All northern bald ibises in zoos, other than those in Turkey, are of the western population, and were imported from Morocco. Three bloodlines exist; the earliest relates to importations to Zoo Basel, Switzerland in the 1950s and 1960s, the next is the descendants of birds taken in the 1970s to stock Rabat Zoo, and the last captured wild birds were those taken to the Naturzoo, Rheine, in 1976 and 1978. Captive birds have a high incidence of skin problems, and 40% of those birds that had to be put down suffered from chronic ulcerative dermatitis, characterised by feather loss, rawness, and ulceration on the back, neck, and the undersides of the wings. The cause of this disease is unknown. Other major disease problems reported in zoo collections have been avian tuberculosis, gastric foreign bodies, bone disease, and heart problems. An outbreak of West Nile virus in Bronx Park, New York, involved northern bald ibises amongst many other species of birds and mammals.

==== Europe ====
In 1504, a decree by Archbishop Leonhard of Salzburg made the northern bald ibis one of the world&#x27;s earliest officially protected species. They nested in the cliffs and on castles and ruins in the Graz/Steiermark and Salzburg regions of Austria and vanished around 1630–1645. Young birds were hunted as a delicacy at feasts for the nobility. Despite the decree, it died out in Austria as elsewhere in Europe.
There are now two ibis reintroduction projects in Austria, at Grünau and Kuchl. A research station at Grünau has a breeding colony managed, like the Turkish population, as a free-flying flock which is caged at migration time. The aim here is to investigate flock interactions and hormonal status, behavioural and ecological aspects of natural foraging, and the establishment of traditions via social learning.

The Scharnstein Project is an attempt to establish a migratory &quot;waldrapp&quot; colony by using ultralight planes to teach a migration route. The scheme builds on the Grünau research by developing a method to control and guide the autumn migration of a founder population, which then can pass this migration tradition to subsequent generations. In May 2002, 11 birds from the Vienna Zoo and the Grünau colony were trained to follow two microlight planes, and in 2003, a first attempt was made to lead a group of birds from Scharnstein to southern Tuscany. Due to adverse weather and technical problems, the birds had to be transported by road over a considerable part of the distance. The subsequent releases were more successful, with birds wintering in Tuscany, and, from 2005, returning to northern Austria. In 2008, a female ibis named Aurelia flew back to Austria for her fourth return to the breeding site. The hazards of the journey are shown by the loss of her two offspring and her mate while on the southern journey in the autumn of 2007.
In August 2013 the European Union agreed to provide support to reintroduction projects until 2019 under its LIFE+ Biodiversity programme. The &quot;Reason for Hope&quot; project under the leadership of the biologist Dr. Johannes Fritz has operated one breeding and observation site in Austria, in Kuchl, near Salzburg, and two similar sites in Burghausen, Bavaria, and in Überlingen on Lake Constance in Baden-Württemberg. The positions and flight patterns of migratory birds are monitored with light-weight solar transmitters. After learning to follow their human foster-mothers seated in ultralight aircraft, around 30 young birds are led over the Alps to spend the winter months in Tuscany. Numerous studies on migratory bird behaviour have been published and presentations given at symposiums. In November 2019 it was announced that the project team succeeded in uniting juvenile birds with experienced adult birds so that they could fly to their wintering site together.

&quot;Proyecto Eremita&quot; is a Spanish reintroduction involving the release of nearly 30 birds in the Ministry of Defence training ground in La Janda district, Barbate, Cádiz Province. It had its first success in 2008, when a pair laid two eggs. This is probably the first attempt to breed in the wild in Spain for 500 years as the last definite reference to the northern bald ibis breeding in Spain is from a 15th-century falconry book. This effort has been undertaken by the Andalusian government&#x27;s Environmental Ministry, the Spanish Ministry of Defence, and the Zoobotánico de Jeréz (Jerez Zoo and Botanical Gardens), with the assistance of the Doñana Biological Station, CSIC and volunteers from the Cádiz Natural History Society. Previously, two birds left the area in 2005 and 14 in 2006, but nothing is known of their whereabouts other than that a ringed bird from Spain was seen in the Middle Atlas, Morocco in 2005. Internet pictures of this species taken near Armação de Pêra, Algarve, Portugal in 2009 and later, may be related to those releases in Spain. In the interim, the Spanish colony has been growing very well, from 9 breeding pairs in 2011, 10 in 2012 and 15 in 2013 to 23 breeding pairs in 2014, which successfully raised 25 chicks in 2014 (Quercus 349(2015): 14-23). In 2014 the total population of this colony was 78 wild birds split into two colonies, originally along the cliffs of the Atlantic coast and in 2012 with a second colony of 5–6 breeding pairs that started at the cliffs 10 km inland next to a country road at La Barca de Vejer (Vejer de la Frontera). In 2022 the wild population of northern bald ibis living near Cádiz has increased to about 180 birds that roam an area of about 50 km.

In June 2023, a pair was reported nesting on a commercial building in Rümlang, near Zurich Airport in Switzerland, with two young, the first recorded breeding pair in Switzerland in over 400 years. The adults were reported to have been tracked from the reintroduction project at Überlingen in Germany.

==== Northern Morocco ====

There is a planned reintroduction of the ibis at Ain Tijja-Mezguitem in the north-east of Morocco. Since the wild populations further south remain vulnerable, and the porous sandstone of their breeding ledges is exposed to erosion, the intention is to establish a non-migratory population (stocked from German, Swiss, and Austrian zoos) in an area where this species was known to have bred up to about 1980. The station in the Rif mountains was built in 2000, and stocked with the first group of zoo-bred birds. A second importation of zoo-bred birds and the construction of an information centre took place in 2004. Six pairs bred in 2006 subsequent to a change in the birds&#x27; diet, and six offspring from five nests were successfully reared. In 2007 there were 19 birds (13 adults and six juveniles) in the aviary.

The rock walls of the mountains have many potential breeding ledges, and an artificial lake provides water to the birds and to the local human population. Steppe pasture which is not exposed to herbicides or pesticides gives good foraging. Once the population reaches around 40 birds, a release will be initiated, subject to international agreement. The reintroduction site is from Agadir on the other side of the Atlas Mountains, so accidental contamination of the wild colonies is unlikely.

== In culture ==
According to local legend in the Birecik area, the northern bald ibis was one of the first birds that Noah released from the Ark as a symbol of fertility, and a lingering religious sentiment in Turkey helped the colonies there to survive long after the demise of the species in Europe, as described above.

This ibis was revered as a holy bird and a symbol of brilliance and splendour in Ancient Egypt, where, together with the sacred ibis, it was regarded as an embodiment of Thoth, scribe of the gods, who was usually depicted with a man&#x27;s body and the head of an ibis. The Old Egyptian word &quot;akh&quot;, &quot;to be resplendent, to shine&quot;, was denoted in hieroglyphs by a bald ibis, presumably as a reference to its glossy plumage. In a more abstract sense, &quot;akh&quot; stood for excellence, glory, honour, and virtue. It has also been used to signify the soul or spirit, one of five elements constituting personality.

Herodotus wrote of the man-eating Stymphalian birds, which had wings of brass and sharp metallic feathers they could fire at their victims. Ridding Lake Stymphalia in Arcadia of these creatures was one of the twelve labours of Heracles. These mythical birds are sometimes considered to be based on the northern bald ibis, but since they were described as marsh birds, and usually depicted without crests, the legendary species is more likely to be derived from the sacred ibis. Some depictions, such as the 6th-century BC Athenian black-figure amphora in the British Museum, clearly show the black head and white body of the sacred ibis. After the bald ibis became extinct in Central Europe, some later writers thought that Gesner&#x27;s description was one of several in his book depicting mythical creatures.

The bird painted in 1490 in one of the Gothic frescoes in the Holy Trinity Church in Hrastovlje (now southwestern Slovenia) in the Karst by John of Kastav was most probably the northern bald ibis. A small illustration of the northern bald ibis is found in the illuminated &quot;St Galler Handschrift&quot; of 1562, a drawing by Joris Hoefnagel in &quot;Missale Romanum&quot; (1582-1590) and in paintings in the collection of Rudolf II at Vienna. It is believed that it had also been depicted at other places in Istria and Dalmatia, where it was presumably native during the Middle Ages, e.g. in the local church in Gradišče pri Divači and in the coat of arms of the noble family Elio from Koper. The portal of Lukovec Castle in Lukovica pri Brezovici (central Slovenia) also features this species.

In Birecik, Turkey an ancient celebration &#x27;Kelaynak yortusu&#x27; held in mid-February to mark the return of the birds from Africa was revived in the 1950s.

Several countries have produced postage stamps which depict the northern bald ibis. They include Algeria, Morocco, Sudan, Syria, Turkey, and Yemen, which are breeding or migration locations; Austria, which is seeking to reintroduce the bird; and Jersey, which has a small captive population.

<doc id="237147" wikidata="Q16254797" url="?curid=237147" title="Polyphase quadrature filter">
<text>A polyphase quadrature filter, or PQF, is a filter bank which splits an input signal into a given number N (mostly a power of 2) of equidistant sub-bands. A factor of N subsamples these sub-bands, so they are critically sampled.
An important application of the polyphase filters (of FIR type) concerns the filtering and decimation of large band (and so high sample rate) input signals, e.g. coming from a high rate ADC, which can not be directly processed by an FPGA or in some case by an ASIC either. Suppose the ADC plus FPGA/ASIC interface implements a demultiplexer of the ADC samples in N internal FPGA/ASIC registers. In that case, the polyphase filter transforms the decimator FIR filter canonic structure in N parallel branches clocked at 1/N of the ADC clock, allowing digital processing when N=Clock(ADC)/Clock(FPGA).

This critical sampling introduces aliasing. Similar to the MDCT time domain alias cancellation the aliasing of polyphase quadrature filters is canceled by neighbouring sub-bands, i.e. signals are typically stored in two sub-bands.

Note that signal in odd subbands is stored frequency inverted.

PQF filters are used in MPEG-1 Audio Layer I and II, Musepack (which was based on MPEG-1 layer II), in MPEG-1 Layer III with an additional MDCT, in MPEG-4 AAC-SSR for the 4 band PQF bank, in MPEG-4 V3 SBR
for the analysis of the upper spectral replicated band, and in DTS.

PQF has an advantage over the very similar stacked quadrature mirror filter (QMF). Delay and computational effort are much lower.

A PQF filter bank is constructed using a base filter, which is a low-pass at fs/4N. This lowpass is modulated by N cosine functions and converted to N band-passes with a bandwidth of fs/2N.

The base lowpass is typically a FIR filter with a length of 10*N ... 24*N taps. Note that it is also possible to build PQF filters using recursive IIR filters.

==Computation==

There are different formulas possible. Most of them are based on the MDCT but are slightly modified.

<doc id="237148" wikidata="Q780816" url="?curid=237148" title="List of Harry Potter translations">
<text>The &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series of fantasy novels by J. K. Rowling is one of the most translated series of all time, being available in 85 languages. This includes languages with fewer than a million speakers such as Basque, Greenlandic, and Welsh, as well as the Classical languages Latin and Ancient Greek. Additionally, regional adaptations of the books have been made to accommodate regional dialects such as the American English edition or the Valencian adaptation of Catalan.

For reasons of secrecy, translations were only allowed to begin after each book had been published in English, creating a lag of several months for readers of other languages. Impatient fans in many places simply bought the book in English instead. &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot; became the first English language book to top France&#x27;s best-seller list. In some cases, fans have created their own unofficial translations, either ahead of a licensed translation or when a licensed translation is unavailable.

Issues arising in the translation of &quot;Harry Potter&quot; include cultural references, riddles, anticipating future plot points, and Rowling&#x27;s creative names for characters and other elements in the magical world which often involve word play and phonology.

== Translation process ==
For an authorised translation, the publisher must first negotiate and sign a contract with Rowling&#x27;s agents, The Blair Partnership. The publishers select translators locally.

So as to prevent plots being leaked, translators were not granted access to the books before their official release date in English; hence, translation could start only after the English editions had been published, creating a lag of several months before the translations were made available. This necessary delay has boosted the sales of English language editions of the books to impatient fans, in countries where English is not the first language. Such was the clamour to read the fifth book that its English edition became the first English-language book ever to top the bookseller list in France. In Italy, impatient Potter fans organised &quot;Operation Feather&quot;, deluging the publisher Salani with feathers (reminiscent of Hogwarts&#x27; messenger owls) to demand expedited publication for the Italian translation of the seventh and final book in the series. This has also caused unauthorised translations and fake versions of the books to appear in many countries.

The high profile and demand for a high-quality local translation means that a great deal of care is often taken in the task. In some countries, such as Italy, the first book was revised by the publishers and issued in an updated edition in response to readers who complained about the quality of the first translation. In countries such as China and Portugal, the translation is conducted by a group of translators working together to save time. Some of the translators hired to work on the books were well known before their work on Harry Potter, such as Viktor Golyshev, who oversaw the Russian translation of the series&#x27; fifth book. Golyshev was renowned for his translations of William Faulkner and George Orwell, and was known to snub the Harry Potter books in interviews and refer to them as inferior literature. The Turkish translation of books two to five was undertaken by Sevin Okyay, a popular literary critic and cultural commentator.
In 2017, Bloomsbury celebrated the series&#x27; 20th anniversary with an announcement that it had been officially translated into 79 languages. Since 2017, Bloomsbury has published or licensed translations into Scots, Hawaiian, Belarusian, Kazakh, Yiddish, and Māori.

Some translations, such as those to the dead Latin and Ancient Greek languages, were done as academic exercises, to stimulate interest in the languages and to provide students of those languages with modern reading texts. The Ancient Greek version, according to the translator, is the longest text written in Ancient Greek since the novels of Heliodorus of Emesa in the 3rd century AD, and took about a year to complete.

== List of translations by language ==
The original British English versions of the book were published in the United Kingdom by Bloomsbury. Note that in some countries, such as Spain and India, the series has been translated into several local languages; sometimes the book has been translated into two dialects of the same language in two countries (for example, separate Portuguese versions for Brazil and Portugal).


== Unauthorised translations ==
The impatience of the international Harry Potter fan community for translations of the books has led to the proliferation of unauthorised or pirate translations that are often hastily translated and posted on the internet chapter-by-chapter, or printed by small presses and sold illegally. The work may be done by multiple translators to speed the process. Such translations are often poorly written and riddled with errors.

A team translated &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot; into Chinese three days after its English release. A director at People&#x27;s Literature Publishing House, who obtained the official license, worried that the unauthorised translations would lead to the spread of pirated copies.

One notable case involved a French 16-year-old who published serialised translations of &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot; online. He was arrested and his site was later shut down; however, the wife of the official translator noted that these works do not necessarily hurt the official translation.

Another example occurred in Venezuela in 2003, when an illegal translation of the fifth book, &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot;, appeared soon after the release of the English version and five months before the scheduled release of the Spanish translation. The pirate translation was apparently so bad that the translator added messages, including &quot;Here comes something that I&#x27;m unable to translate, sorry,&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, I didn&#x27;t understand what that meant&quot; in some sections. Two people were arrested in connection with the pirated version.

Another case involved the Internet fan translation community, &quot;Harry auf Deutsch&quot;, formed to translate the Harry Potter books into German more rapidly. The German publisher of the Harry Potter books, Carlsen Verlag, filed a cease and desist against the fan translators; they complied, taking down the translations.

In some countries, where there were no authorised translations into the local language, translations not sanctioned by J. K. Rowling were prepared and published. Such was the case, for example, in Sri Lanka, where the books had been unofficially translated into Sinhala and possibly into Tamil. Authorised translations into both Sinhala and Tamil have since been published.

In Iran, several unauthorised translations of the Harry Potter books exist side by side. According to one source, there may be as many as 16 Persian translations in existence concurrently. Iran is not a member of the Universal Copyright Convention, so publishers are not prosecuted for publishing foreign books without respecting copyright or paying royalties.

A team consisting of seven Esperantist volunteers completed the translation of &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; into Esperanto (under the title &quot;Hari Poter kaj la ŝtono de la saĝuloj&quot;) in 2004. Rowling&#x27;s representatives did not respond to offers from Esperanto-USA to make the translation available for publication. An online petition aimed at raising interest in the Esperanto translation has obtained support from approximately 800 individuals.

Agents representing J. K. Rowling have stated in the past that they cannot and do not intend to prevent individuals from translating Rowling&#x27;s books for their own personal enjoyment, as long as the results are not made available to the general public.

== Fake translations ==

Whereas &quot;pirate translations&quot; are unauthorised translations of true Harry Potter books, &quot;fake translations&quot; have also appeared, which are published pastiches or fanfics that a foreign publisher has tried to pass off as the translation of the real book by Rowling. There have been several such books, the most famous of which is probably &quot;Harry Potter and Bao Zoulong&quot; which was written and published in China in 2002, before the release of the fifth book in Rowling&#x27;s series, &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot;.

Other fake Harry Potter books written in Chinese include &quot;Harry Potter and the Porcelain Doll&quot; (哈利・波特与瓷娃娃 or Hālì Bōtè yǔ Cíwáwa), &quot;Harry Potter and the Golden Turtle&quot;, and &quot;Harry Potter and the Crystal Vase&quot;. In August 2007, &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that the publication of Rowling&#x27;s &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot; had inspired &quot;a surge of peculiarly Chinese imitations,&quot; and included plot synopses and excerpts from a number of derivative works, among them &quot;Harry Potter and the Chinese Overseas Students at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry&quot; and &quot;Harry Potter and the Big Funnel&quot;.
 In 2003, legal pressure from the licensors of Harry Potter led an Indian publisher to stop publication of &quot;Harry Potter in Calcutta&quot;, a work in which Harry meets figures from Bengali literature.

== Regional adaptations ==
It is a common practice within the publishing industry to make minor changes in the text of books written in one region for publication in other regions. For example, there are a number of differences in British and American English spelling conventions; generally publishers change the spellings to conform to the expectations of their target market. Adaptation may also extend to vocabulary or grammatical choices that might impair legibility or impart some cognitive dissonance. Readers usually would not be aware of the adaptations, but the choice to change the title of the American edition of the first &quot;Harry Potter&quot; book from &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; to &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#x27;s Stone&quot; highlighted the practice and drew considerable attention.

The book&#x27;s title was changed due to the American publisher&#x27;s concern that children would be confused by a reference to philosophy. Other translations have also changed the first book&#x27;s title, for instance, the French translation which changed &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; to &quot;Harry Potter at the School of Wizards&quot; for the same reason as the American translation, citing that the reference to the philosopher&#x27;s stone legend was &quot;too obscure for a book aimed at the youth.&quot;

Other translations also have regional adaptations that have largely gone without much notice. The Spanish translation has been adapted to three regions: Europe, Latin America and Southern Cone. Others translations have adaptations that were published seemingly to enhance the identity of minority communities of speakers: Montenegrin (an adaptation of Serbian) and Valencian (an adaptation of Catalan). It is worth noting that some translations were completed when adaptations possibly would have been sufficient; for example, any of the Serbian, Croatian or Bosnian translations could have been adapted for each region.

A comprehensive list of differences between the American and British editions of the books is collected at the Harry Potter Lexicon website. The changes are mostly simple lexical switches to reflect the different dialects and prevent American readers from stumbling over unfamiliar Briticisms. Although it is common to adapt &quot;any&quot; text from British to American editions, in the case of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books, this standard practice has drawn criticism from readers who feel that the British English adds flavour to the series. Rowling herself expressed regret over changing the first book&#x27;s title, as the philosopher&#x27;s stone is a legendary alchemical substance.

In an Associated Press interview, Rowling described how the alterations to the American editions came about:

Publisher Arthur Levine of Scholastic explained the changes in an interview with &quot;The New Yorker&quot;:

The same article, however, points out that some British dialect was retained in the books, and in some cases certain phrases were replaced with more recognizable British phrases, such as &quot;spanking good&quot; for &quot;cracking.&quot;

== Difficulties in translation ==
The Harry Potter series presents many challenges to translators, such as rhymes, acronyms, dialects, culture, riddles, jokes, invented words, and plot points that revolve around spellings or initials. These have been dealt with by various translators with different degrees of modification to the meaning of the original text.

=== Translation strategies ===
The books carried a number of words that are considered &quot;loaded names&quot; by linguists and translators, meaning that they carry a semantic load, and that their morphology (structure) and phonology (sound) need to be adapted when translating them to a foreign language, for example the house names (Ravenclaw = raven + claw), or Voldemort&#x27;s name (&quot;flight of death&quot; or &quot;theft of death&quot; in French). These words were translated in different countries using several translation strategies, such as &quot;copying&quot; the names with no attempt to transmit the original English meaning, &quot;transliterating&quot; even if the name lost its original meaning, &quot;replacing&quot; the name with another given name from the target language, or &quot;translating&quot; the name using native words that conveyed the same meaning. For example, in the Russian first book the transliterating strategy was used for some names because the &quot;th&quot; sound does not exist in Russian, so &quot;Slytherin&quot; was transliterated as &quot;Slizerin&quot;. The translator of the second book chose the translating strategy instead, and she renamed the houses, &quot;Hufflepuff&quot; becoming &quot;Puffendui&quot; and &quot;Ravenclaw&quot; becoming &quot;Kogtevran&quot; (from the Russian word for claw, &quot;kogot&#x27;&quot;). In the Italian editions, the house names were changed to animal-colour pairings: Gryffindor is &quot;Grifondoro&quot; (&quot;grifon d&#x27;oro&quot; means &quot;golden griffin&quot;), Slytherin is &quot;Serpeverde&quot; (&quot;serpe verde&quot; means &quot;green snake&quot;), Ravenclaw was, in the first edition of the first book, &quot;Pecoranera&quot; (&quot;pecora nera&quot;, &quot;black sheep&quot;), but was then changed to &quot;Corvonero&quot; (&quot;corvo nero&quot;, &quot;black raven&quot;) and Hufflepuff is &quot;Tassorosso&quot; (&quot;tasso rosso&quot;, &quot;red badger&quot;) in the first translation and the films and &quot;Tassofrasso&quot; in the revisited translation. In the French translation, the name &quot;Hogwarts&quot; is changed to &quot;Poudlard&quot;, which means &quot;bacon lice&quot;, roughly maintaining the original idea of warts of a hog.

Marketers of Harry Potter-themed toys pressured translators not to change the names of people and things so that they could call the toys by the same name in different countries.

=== Culture and language ===
Many of the nuances of British culture and language will be unfamiliar to international readers. Such things require careful and creative translating. For the Hebrew translation, some of the Christian references were changed, because Israelis have less familiarity with cultural Christianity than readers elsewhere: a scene in which Sirius Black sings a parody of &quot;God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen&quot; replaced the song with a parody of &quot;Mi Y&#x27;malel,&quot; a Chanukah song; on the other hand, in the Yiddish translation, translator Arun Viswanath retained all the Christian references, feeling that his readership would be familiar enough with them. In the French translation, explanations of certain features of British schools unfamiliar to French students were inserted in the dialogues (e.g., &quot;Prefect&quot; and &quot;Head Boy&quot;), but they were not distinguished from explanations in the original text of differences between ordinary British schools and wizarding schools. This could mislead readers into thinking that these features of the house and boarding systems did not exist in real-world British schools.

Nonstandard English present in the book also had to be given careful consideration. The character Rubeus Hagrid&#x27;s West Country dialect, for example, needed to be rendered in other languages to reflect the fact that he speaks with an accent and uses particular types of slang. In the Japanese translation, he speaks in the Tōhoku dialect, which to a Japanese reader conveys a similar provincial feel. The same was done in Ukrainian translation where Hagrid speaks a mixture of Western Ukrainian dialects. In the Yiddish translation, translator Arun Viswanath attempted to mirror Rowling&#x27;s use of regional British dialects using Yiddish dialects.
&quot;I tried to transpose the wizarding world onto a map of the Yiddish-speaking world&quot; — pre World War II — &quot;without making the characters Jewish. Filch speaks in a thick Lithuanian Yiddish accent and doesn’t pronounce the &#x27;sh&#x27; sound, so he says sabes instead of shabes, and Hagrid, who despises him and speaks a very distinct rural English, speaks in a thick, almost exaggerated Polish Yiddish. I thought this was a good approach because it helps show the tension between them. As for Snape and McGonagall, well, they’re Litvaks. They just are.&quot;

Some translations changed foods that appeared in the book into foods more common in the culture of their target audience in order to be more recognisable and relatable. The Hebrew translation of the scene where Dumbledore offers Professor McGonagall a lemon sherbet had him offer her a Krembo, a popular Israeli treat, instead. According to the Hebrew translator, &quot;the point of the lemon sherbets is to tell us something about Dumbledore’s character in that this wise old wizard with a long white beard carries around a children’s treat in his pocket. The equivalent children’s dessert in Israel is the krembo. If I’d translated it as a lemon sucking candy, it wouldn’t have imparted the same image of Dumbledore.&quot; The Arabic translation, which was written with a predominantly Muslim audience in mind, omitted references to food and drink forbidden by Islam. All references to pork and bacon were replaced with eggs and all references to alcoholic beverages were replaced with water, except in the case of the Death Eaters, who are villains. However, the Hebrew translation left in place references to bacon despite reader complaints that such products violated the laws of Kashrut, with the translator justifying it on the basis that the characters were not Jewish. The Chinese translation keeps the word &quot;cornflakes&quot; and has a footnote explaining what cornflakes are.

As the Arabic translators were seeking to cater to religiously conservative readers, they also removed every reference to characters kissing, even on the cheek, and had them wave instead.

Several other terms were translated to create cultural references for the target audience. For example, the &quot;golden snitch&quot; from Quidditch is rendered as &quot;goldene flaterl&quot; (golden butterfly) in the Yiddish translation, butterflies being a common symbol in Yiddish folktales. Similarly, the Snatchers, a group of people who capture Muggle-born wizards and other enemies of the Death Eater regime and hand them over for money following Voldemort&#x27;s takeover of the Ministry of Magic, were referred to as Szmalcownicy in the Polish translation, in reference to Poles who sold out Jews to the Nazis for money during the Holocaust.

The title of the seventh book, &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot;, proved particularly difficult to translate into different languages. Rowling solved the problem by providing translators with an alternate title: &quot;Harry Potter and the Relics of Death&quot;. This became the basis for most translations of the title.

Languages with different word order than English presented challenges when a character begins speaking and is interrupted before finishing. For instance, in &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot;, Ron Weasley asks his mother &quot;Why in the name of Merlin&#x27;s saggy left...&quot; before his father cuts him off and scolds him for talking to her that way. In other languages, such as Hebrew, nouns come before modifier adjectives, but as it is never revealed what noun Ron intended to use, it proved difficult to translate without significant guesswork.

=== Rhymes, anagrams, and acronyms ===
The series involves many songs, poems, and rhymes, some of which proved difficult to translators. One rhyme, a riddle told by a sphinx in &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot;, posed a particular problem. The riddle involves taking words from a poem and using them to form a longer word, &quot;spider,&quot; in answer to the riddle. In the Taiwanese translation, the English words are simply put in parentheses. In other translations, the riddle is changed to provide different words that can be put together to make up the translated version of &quot;spider&quot;.

Some acronyms also proved difficult; the abbreviations &quot;O.W.L.s&quot; (Ordinary Wizarding Levels) and &quot;N.E.W.T.s&quot; (Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests) needed to be translated to reflect the fact that their abbreviations spelled out the names of animals associated with the wizarding world, which did not always work in other languages. &quot;N.E.W.T.s&quot; was translated into Swedish as &quot;F.U.T.T.&quot; (Fruktansvärt Utmattande Trollkarls-Test, Terribly Exhausting Wizard&#x27;s Test). &quot;Futt&quot; means &quot;measly&quot; in Swedish.

Other challenging names in the series include the Mirror of Erised (&quot;desire&quot; backwards) and Voldemort&#x27;s real name. In the latter&#x27;s case, the name is an anagram based on the character&#x27;s birth name, Tom Marvolo Riddle, which is rearranged to spell &quot;I am Lord Voldemort&quot;. This has required translators to alter Riddle&#x27;s name to make the anagram work. Sometimes translators manage to alter only one part of the name whereas others have replaced the entire name to preserve the anagram. Other translations, such as the Taiwanese Chinese and Japanese versions, sidestepped the issue altogether by displaying the main text of the anagram in English and added in the meaning in brackets beside it. The Vietnamese version displayed the original anagram in English and added a footnote.

=== Invented words, proper nouns, and names ===
Rowling invented a great number of words and phrases for the books such as spells, incantations, magical words, items, and place names. Many of these words involve word play, rhyming, and historical references that are difficult to translate. A large number of spells are drawn from or inspired by Latin, and have a certain resonance with English speakers due to its relatively large proportion of Latinate-derived vocabulary. For example, &quot;priori incantatem&quot; (a spell which causes the last spells performed by a wand to be reproduced in reverse order) would be familiar to many English-speaking readers as the words &quot;prior&quot; (previous) and &quot;incantation&quot; (spell, charm). To create a similar effect in the Hindi version, the Sanskrit, typical in mantras, has been used for the spells. Some translators have created new words themselves; others have resorted to transliteration. Names that involve word play, such as &quot;Knockturn Alley&quot; and &quot;Pensieve&quot; are also difficult to translate.

In &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone&quot;, when Professor McGonagall is about to introduce Harry to Oliver Wood, she asks another professor if she can &quot;borrow Wood for a moment&quot;, momentarily confusing Harry. In order to retain this pun, the Yiddish translation renames Wood as &quot;Oliver Holtz&quot;, &quot;holtz&quot; being the Yiddish for wood, unlike the Italian one, which changed the surname to &quot;Baston&quot;, from &quot;bastone&quot;, &quot;stick&quot;, but returned to the original &quot;Wood&quot; with the second translation.

Often, names in Harry Potter have historical or linguistic significance in English, which may create problems if the translator does not recognise it. Rowling commented on this phenomenon in &quot;Conversations with J.K. Rowling&quot;, in which she complained that the Italian translation of Professor Dumbledore&#x27;s last name was &quot;Silente&quot;; rather than recognising that &quot;Dumbledore&quot; was an old Devon word for &quot;bumblebee,&quot; the translator took the word &quot;dumb&quot; and translated it as &quot;silent&quot;. In contrast, the Czech translator used the Old Czech word for bumblebee – &quot;Brumbál&quot; (in modern Czech &quot;čmelák&quot;). The French translation renamed Severus Snape as &#x27;Rogue&#x27;; in Italian he was renamed &quot;Piton&quot; (from the Italian &quot;pitone&quot;, &quot;python&quot;). Hungarian also calls him &quot;Piton&quot;. Instead, the same Italian translation changed the name of Professor Sybill Trelawney into &quot;Sibilla Cooman&quot;, which resembles the Italian &quot;Sibilla Cumana&quot;, the Cumaean Sibyl, although, like many other names, it was brought back to the original in the revised translation.

=== Plot points ===
In some cases, English-speaking fans have sought clues to the story&#x27;s mysteries by examining the way certain parts of the books have been translated in foreign editions. A case in point is the identity of a character mentioned by initials only in the book &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot;. The English initials R.A.B. could have belonged to several minor characters from the books, but variations on the initials in other languages gave evidence to the true identity of the mystery character: in the Dutch edition of the book R.A.B. was translated into R.A.Z., &#x27;zwart&#x27; being Dutch for &#x27;black&#x27;; in the Norwegian edition, R.A.B. translates to &#x27;R.A.S.&#x27;, &quot;svart&quot; being Norwegian for &#x27;black&#x27;; and in the Finnish edition the initials were R.A.M., &#x27;musta&#x27; being Finnish for &#x27;black&#x27;. Fans took this to mean that the character was Regulus Black, the brother of Sirius Black; when &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot; was published, this was revealed to be the case.

Similarly, the title for &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot; did not make it obvious whether the word &quot;Order&quot; referred to a group of people or to a directive. The information that it was a group of people was then determined by viewing the title in other languages. The Vietnamese translation, which was originally published in instalments, originally interpreted &quot;Order&quot; as a directive and translated it as &quot;Harry Potter và Mệnh lệnh Phượng hoàng&quot;; when it became clear that &quot;Order&quot; referred to a group of people, the title was changed to &quot;Harry Potter và Hội Phượng hoàng&quot;.

Rowling released an alternative title for &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot; for use by translators finding difficulty translating its meaning. The alternative title (in English) is &quot;Harry Potter and the Relics of Death&quot;. In Italy the title has been translated as &quot;Harry Potter e i doni della morte&quot; replacing &quot;hallows&quot; with &quot;presents&quot; because the word &quot;relic&quot; is often used in reference to the remains or personal effects of a saint. This variation was proposed and then approved by J.K. Rowling.

=== Character gender ===
A few characters in the series are identified with a title and last name, or with a gender-neutral name. In some languages—for example, those where adjectives are gendered—it was necessary for the translator to guess the character&#x27;s gender. The Hebrew translation initially made Blaise Zabini a girl, though the character was revealed to be a boy in later books. To avoid this problem, Isabel Nunes, the Portuguese translator, asked Rowling about the gender of some of the characters—Zabini, Professor Sinistra, and &quot;R.A.B.&quot;—while working on her translations.

<text>Loaded language is rhetoric used to influence an audience by using words and phrases with strong connotations. This type of language is very often made vague to more effectively invoke an emotional response and/or exploit stereotypes. Loaded words and phrases have significant emotional implications and involve strongly positive or negative reactions beyond their literal meaning.

==Definition==
Loaded terms, also known as emotive or ethical words, were clearly described by Charles Stevenson. He noticed that there are words that do not merely describe a possible state of affairs. &quot;&quot; is not used only to refer to a person who commits specific actions with a specific intent. Words such as &quot;&quot; or &quot;&quot; carry with them something more than a simple description of a concept or an action. They have a &quot;magnetic&quot; effect, an imperative force, a tendency to influence the interlocutor&#x27;s decisions. They are strictly bound to moral values leading to value judgements and potentially triggering specific emotions. For this reason, they have an emotive dimension. In the modern psychological terminology, we can say that these terms carry &quot;emotional valence&quot;, as they presuppose and generate a value judgement that can lead to an emotion.

The appeal to emotion is in contrast to an appeal to logic and reason. Authors R. Malcolm Murray and Nebojša Kujundžić distinguish &quot;&quot;prima facie&quot; reasons&quot; from &quot;considered reasons&quot; when discussing this. An emotion, elicited via emotive language, may form a &quot;prima facie&quot; reason for action, but further work is required before one can obtain a &quot;considered&quot; reason.

Emotive arguments and loaded language are particularly persuasive because they exploit the human weakness for acting immediately based upon an emotional response, &quot;without&quot; such further considered judgement. Due to such potential for emotional complication, it is generally advisable to avoid loaded language in argument or speech when fairness and impartiality is one of the goals. Anthony Weston, for example, admonishes students and writers: &quot;In general, avoid language whose only function is to sway the emotions&quot;.

One aspect of loaded language is that loaded words and phrases occur in pairs, sometimes as political framing techniques by individuals with opposing agendas. Heller calls these &quot;a Boo! version and a Hooray! version&quot; to differentiate those with negative and positive emotional connotations. Examples include &quot;bureaucrat&quot; versus &quot;public servant&quot;, &quot;anti-abortion&quot; versus &quot;pro-life&quot;, &quot;regime&quot; versus &quot;government&quot;, and &quot;elitist&quot; versus &quot;expert&quot;.

==Examples==

Politicians employ euphemisms, and study how to use them effectively: which words to use or avoid using to gain political advantage or disparage an opponent. Speechwriter and journalist Richard Heller gives the example that it is common for a politician to advocate &quot;investment in public services,&quot; because it has a more favorable connotation than &quot;public spending.&quot;

In the 1946 essay &quot;Politics and the English Language&quot;, George Orwell discussed the use of loaded language in political discourse:

<doc id="237168" wikidata="Q524415" url="?curid=237168" title="Electric Ladyland">
<text>Electric Ladyland is the third and final studio album by the Jimi Hendrix Experience, released in October 1968. A double album, it was the only record from the Experience with production solely credited to Hendrix. The band&#x27;s most commercially successful release and its only number one album, it was released by Reprise Records in the United States on October 16, 1968, and by Track Records in the UK nine days later. By mid-November, it had reached number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart, spending two weeks there. In the UK it peaked at number 6, where it spent 12 weeks on the British charts.

&quot;Electric Ladyland&quot; includes a cover of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot;, which became the Experience&#x27;s best-selling single, reaching number six in the UK and number 20 in the United States. Although the album confounded critics upon its release, it has since been viewed as one of Hendrix&#x27;s best works and one of the greatest albums of all time, being featured on various &quot;greatest albums&quot; lists, including &quot;Q&#x27;s&quot; 2003 list of the 100 greatest albums and various editions of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, on which it was ranked 53rd in the 2020 iteration.

==Recording and production==
The Experience began recording &quot;Electric Ladyland&quot; at several studios in the United States and UK between July 1967 and January 1968. Recording resumed on April 18, 1968, at the newly opened Record Plant Studios in New York City, with Chas Chandler as producer and engineers Eddie Kramer and Gary Kellgren.

Hendrix was famous for his studio perfectionism; he and drummer Mitch Mitchell recorded over 50 takes of &quot;Gypsy Eyes&quot; over three sessions. Hendrix was insecure about his voice and often recorded his vocals hidden behind studio screens. He sang backing vocals himself on the title track and on &quot;Long Hot Summer Night&quot;. As recording progressed, Chandler became frustrated with Hendrix&#x27;s perfectionism and his demands for repeated takes.

Hendrix allowed friends and guests to join them in the studio, which contributed to a chaotic and crowded environment in the control room and led Chandler to sever his professional relationship with Hendrix. Bassist Noel Redding recalled: &quot;There were tons of people in the studio; you couldn&#x27;t move. It was a party, not a session.&quot;

Redding, who had formed his own band in mid-1968, Fat Mattress, found it increasingly difficult to fulfill his commitments with the Experience, so Hendrix played many of the bass parts. The album&#x27;s cover states that it was &quot;produced and directed by Jimi Hendrix&quot;, which disturbed Chandler since he produced some of the songs. The double LP was the only Experience album mixed entirely in stereo.

Hendrix experimented with other combinations of musicians, including Jefferson Airplane&#x27;s Jack Casady and Traffic&#x27;s Steve Winwood, who played bass and organ, respectively, on the 15-minute slow-blues jam &quot;Voodoo Chile&quot;. In March 1968, he was joined onstage at the Scene Club in New York by Jim Morrison of the Doors and in early April, Hendrix appeared at an impromptu jam with B.B. King, Al Kooper, and Elvin Bishop.

==Music==
According to music critic Jim DeRogatis, &quot;Electric Ladyland&quot; is &quot;a sprawling exploration of the studio as a place to create what [Hendrix] called &#x27;sound paintings.&#x27;&quot; According to music journalist David Stubbs, &quot;Electric Ladyland&quot; is &quot;undoubtedly a rock album, albeit rock on the point of evolving into something else.&quot; &quot;Uncut&quot; magazine&#x27;s John Robinson said that its music reconciles the psychedelic pop of Hendrix&#x27;s earlier recordings with the aggressive funk he would explore on his 1970 album &quot;Band of Gypsys&quot;. During its recording, Kramer experimented with innovative studio techniques such as backmasking, chorus effect, echo, and flanging, which AllMusic&#x27;s Cub Koda said recontextualized Hendrix&#x27;s psychedelic and funk sounds on the album.

&quot;Electric Ladyland&quot; is a cross-section of Hendrix&#x27;s wide range of musical talent. It includes examples of several genres and styles of music: the psychedelic &quot;Burning of the Midnight Lamp&quot;, a UK single the previous summer (1967), the extended blues jam &quot;Voodoo Chile&quot;, the New Orleans-style R&amp;B of Earl King&#x27;s &quot;Come On&quot;, the epic studio production of &quot;1983... (A Merman I Should Turn to Be)&quot;, the social commentary of &quot;House Burning Down&quot;, and the sixties-era British pop of Noel Redding&#x27;s &quot;Little Miss Strange&quot;. The album also features an electric reworking of the Bob Dylan song &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot;, which has been highly acclaimed by critics as well as by Dylan himself, and also &quot;Voodoo Child (Slight Return)&quot;, a staple of both radio and guitar repertoire. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Holly George-Warren praised &quot;Crosstown Traffic&quot; for its hard rock guitar riff.

&quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot; became the band&#x27;s top-selling single and their only US top 40 hit, peaking at number 20; it reached number five in the UK. The album also included one of Hendrix&#x27;s most prominent uses of a wah-wah pedal, on &quot;Burning of the Midnight Lamp&quot;, which reached number 18 in the UK charts.

==Cover==
Hendrix had written to Reprise describing what he wanted for the cover art, but was largely ignored. He expressly asked for a color photo by Linda Eastman (later known as Linda McCartney following her marriage with Paul McCartney) of the group sitting with children on the sculpture of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; in Central Park, and drew a picture of it for reference. The company instead used a blurred red and yellow photo of his head while performing at Saville Theatre, taken by Karl Ferris.
Track Records used its art department, which produced a cover image by photographer David Montgomery, who also shot the inside cover portrait of Hendrix, depicting nineteen nude women lounging in front of a black background. Hendrix expressed initial displeasure and surprise with this &quot;naked lady&quot; cover (but later told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine that he &quot;dug it anyway&quot;), much as he was displeased with the &quot;&quot; cover, which he found disrespectful. The cover was banned by several record dealers as &quot;pornographic&quot;, while others sold it with the gatefold cover turned inside out, or in a brown wrapper.

In France and the Benelux countries, Hendrix&#x27;s recordings were released by Barclay Records, and &quot;Electric Ladyland&quot; featured a front cover photograph by Alain Dister, and inner sleeve photographs by Jean-Pierre Leloir and Donald Silverstein.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Electric Ladyland&quot; was released in the US on October 16, 1968. It was a &quot;hit psychedelic album&quot;, Richie Unterberger later wrote, and by mid-November, it had reached number one in the US, spending two weeks atop the pop charts. The double LP was the Experience&#x27;s most commercially successful release and Hendrix&#x27;s only number-one album. In the UK, it peaked at number six and charted for 12 weeks.

&quot;Electric Ladyland&quot; confounded contemporary critics; reviewers praised some of its songs but felt the album lacked structure and sounded too dense. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; called it &quot;mixed-up and muddled&quot;, with the exception of &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot;, which the magazine called a masterpiece. Reviewing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1968, Tony Glover said Hendrix&#x27;s original songs sometimes sound unstructured and was somewhat disappointed by the &quot;heavy handed guitar&quot; on &quot;1983... (A Merman I Should Turn to Be)&quot; and the science-fiction conclusion to &quot;House Burning Down&quot;. Ultimately, Glover appreciated the &quot;energy flow&quot; unifying the songs and described Hendrix as &quot;amazing&quot;, adding that &quot;Electric Ladyland&quot; serves as &quot;an extended look into Hendrix&#x27;s head, and mostly it seems to have some pretty good things in it (who among us is totally free of mental garbage?)&quot;. Robert Christgau was more enthusiastic in &quot;Stereo Review&quot;, regarding it as an explosive showcase of rock&#x27;s &quot;most important recent innovation&quot;—the &quot;heavy&quot; guitar aesthetic—and &quot;an integrated work-in-itself in more ways than one&quot;. He found the production exceptional—&quot;the best job of stereo for its own sake I know&quot;—and was surprisingly impressed by the quality of the lyrics. While most guitarists in rock believed improvisation to be a straightforward endeavor, Christgau said &quot;Hendrix achieves unique effects, effects you&#x27;ll never get from Kenny Burrell&quot;, citing &quot;Voodoo Chile&quot; as an example. He later named &quot;Electric Ladyland&quot; the fifth-best album of 1968 in his ballot for &quot;Jazz &amp; Pop&quot; magazine&#x27;s critics poll.

=== Reappraisal ===

Over time, &quot;Electric Ladyland&quot;″s critical standing improved significantly, with author and musicologist John Perry describing it as &quot;one of the greatest double-albums in Rock.&quot; According to author Michael Heatley, &quot;most critics agree&quot; that the album was &quot;the fullest realization of Jimi&#x27;s far-reaching ambitions&quot;; &quot;Guitar World&quot; editor Noe Goldwasser called it his greatest work. The record was also deemed an essential hard rock album in Tom Larson&#x27;s 2004 book &quot;History of Rock and Roll&quot;, and &quot;Clash&quot; reviewer Robin Murray viewed it as a &quot;true classic of the psychedelic rock era&quot;. In a retrospective review for &quot;Blender&quot;, Christgau wrote that it was the definitive work of psychedelic music, describing the record as &quot;an aural utopia that accommodates both ingrained conflict and sweet, vague spiritual yearnings, held together by a master musician&quot;. In Charlotte Greig&#x27;s opinion, much like &quot;Are You Experienced&quot;, &quot;Electric Ladyland&quot; was &quot;groundbreaking, introducing audiences to a style of psychedelic rock rooted in the blues&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; critic Geoffrey Himes names it an exemplary release of the progressive soul development from 1968 to 1973. Author Amy Wallace called the album a &quot;classic of acid rock.&quot;

&quot;Electric Ladyland&quot; has been featured on many greatest album lists, including a number 10 ranking on &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 Greatest Rock Albums Ever, and number 37 on &quot;The Times&quot;″ 100 Best Albums of All Time. Music journalist and author Peter Doggett argued that it is very likely the greatest rock album of all time because of its exceptional concept, artful melodies, experimentation, and skilled musicianship, which he felt remains unparalleled by any other rock artist. The album was included in &quot;A Basic Record Library&quot; of 1950s and 1960s recordings, published in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981). 
In 1999, it was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, and in 2000, it was voted number 32 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. In 2003, &quot;Q&quot; magazine named &quot;Electric Ladyland&quot; as one of the 100 greatest albums. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it 54th in the 2003 edition of its &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; publication and 53rd in the 2020 edition.

==Track listing==
The original US Reprise and UK Track albums did not list running times for the songs. Track lengths are taken from the 1968 International Polydor Production album. Some of the song titles differ slightly between the original US and UK album editions and between the titles shown on the album back cover, the inside liner notes, and the labels on the records themselves; the titles listed here are those shown on the record labels. All songs are written by Jimi Hendrix, except where noted.



===Notes===
*As was common with multi-LP albums, sides A and D were pressed back to back on the same platter, likewise sides B and C. This was called auto-coupling or automatic sequencing and was intended to make it easier to play through the entire album in sequence (A B C D) on automatic record changers. For the cassette version where everything was fit onto one tape, album sides A &amp; C were put together on side 1 with B &amp; D on side 2.

*A new 50th anniversary edition was released on November 28, 2018. It features Hendrix&#x27;s originally intended cover, and is available as a box-set with either a Blu-ray disc and 3-CDs or a Blu-ray disc and 6-LPs. The Blu-ray includes a 5.1 surround mix by Eddie Kramer and a high resolution version of the album remaster. The remastering was done by Bernie Grundman from the original master tapes. The box set also features early takes, demos and live concert from September 14, 1968, at the Hollywood Bowl plus a 1997 documentary &quot;At Last...The Beginning: The Making of Electric Ladyland&quot; featuring Chas Chandler, Mitch Mitchell, Noel Redding and Eddie Kramer.

<doc id="237170" wikidata="Q2699730" url="?curid=237170" title="Quadrature mirror filter">
<text>In digital signal processing, a quadrature mirror filter is a filter whose magnitude response is the mirror image around formula_1 of that of another filter. Together these filters, first introduced by Croisier et al., are known as the quadrature mirror filter pair.

A filter formula_2 is the quadrature mirror filter of formula_3 if formula_4.

The filter responses are symmetric about formula_5:

: formula_6

In audio/voice codecs, a quadrature mirror filter pair is often used to implement a filter bank that splits an input signal into two bands. The resulting high-pass and low-pass signals are often reduced by a factor of 2, giving a critically sampled two-channel representation of the original signal. The analysis filters are often related by the following formula in addition to quadrate mirror property:
: formula_7
where formula_8 is the frequency, and the sampling rate is normalized to formula_9.
This is known as power complementary property.
In other words, the power sum of the high-pass and low-pass filters is equal to 1. 

Orthogonal wavelets – the Haar wavelets and related Daubechies wavelets, Coiflets, and some developed by Mallat, are generated by scaling functions which, with the wavelet, satisfy a quadrature mirror filter relationship.

==Relationship to other filter banks==
The earliest wavelets were based on expanding a function in terms of rectangular steps, the Haar wavelets. This is usually a poor approximation, whereas Daubechies wavelets are among the simplest but most important families of wavelets. A linear filter that is zero for “smooth” signals, given a record of formula_10 points formula_11 is defined as
: formula_12

It is desirable to have it vanish for a constant, so taking the order formula_13, for example,
: formula_14
And to have it vanish for a linear ramp, so that
: formula_15

A linear filter will vanish for any formula_16, and this is all that can be done with a fourth-order wavelet. Six terms will be needed to vanish a quadratic curve, and so on, given the other constraints to be included. Next an accompanying filter may be defined as
: formula_17

This filter responds in an exactly opposite manner, being large for smooth signals and small for non-smooth signals. A linear filter is just a convolution of the signal with the filter’s coefficients, so the series of the coefficients is the signal that the filter responds to maximally. Thus, the output of the second filter vanishes when the coefficients of the first one are input into it. The aim is to have
: formula_18

Where the associated time series flips the order of the coefficients because the linear filter is a convolution, and so both have the same index in this sum. A pair of filters with this property are defined as quadrature mirror filters.
Even if the two resulting bands have been subsampled by a factor of 2, the relationship between the filters means that approximately perfect reconstruction is possible. That is, the two bands can then be upsampled, filtered again with the same filters and added together, to reproduce the original signal exactly (but with a small delay). (In practical implementations, numeric precision issues in floating-point arithmetic may affect the perfection of the reconstruction.)

<text>Bild (, ) or Bild-Zeitung (, ) is a German tabloid newspaper published by Axel Springer SE. The paper is published from Monday to Saturday; on Sundays, its sister paper &quot;Bild am Sonntag&quot; () is published instead, which has a different style and its own editors. &quot;Bild&quot; is tabloid in style but broadsheet in size. It is the best-selling European newspaper and has the sixteenth-largest circulation worldwide. &quot;Bild&quot; has been described as &quot;notorious for its mix of gossip, inflammatory language, and sensationalism&quot; and as having a huge influence on German politicians. Its nearest English-language stylistic and journalistic equivalent is often considered to be the British national newspaper &quot;The Sun&quot;, the second-highest-selling European tabloid newspaper.

==History==

&quot;Bild&quot; was founded by Axel Springer (1912–1985) in 1952. It mostly consisted of pictures (hence the name &quot;Bild&quot;, German for picture). &quot;Bild&quot; soon became the best-selling tabloid, by a wide margin, not only in Germany, but in all of Europe, though essentially to German readers. Through most of its history, &quot;Bild&quot; was based in Hamburg. The paper moved its headquarters to Berlin in March 2008, stating that it was an essential base of operations for a national newspaper. It is printed nationwide with 32 localized editions. Special editions are printed in some favoured German holiday destinations abroad such as Spain, Italy, Turkey and Greece.

&quot;Bild&quot; sold more than five million copies every day in the 1980s. In 1993 the paper had a circulation of slightly more than four million copies, making it the most read newspaper in the country. In the period of 1995–96 its circulation was 4,300,000 copies. In 2001 &quot;Bild&quot; was the most read newspaper in Europe, and also in Germany, with a circulation of 4,396,000 copies.

Although it is still Germany&#x27;s biggest paper, the circulation of &quot;Bild&quot;, along with many other papers, has been on the decline in recent years. By the end of 2005, the figure dropped to 3.8 million copies. Its daily circulation in 2010 was 3,548,000, making the paper the fifth in the list of the world&#x27;s biggest selling newspapers.

&quot;Bild&quot; is published in tabloid format. In the paper&#x27;s beginnings, Springer was influenced by the model of the British tabloid &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, although Bild&#x27;s paper size is larger, this is reflected in its mix of celebrity gossip, crime stories and political analysis. However, its articles are often considerably shorter compared to those in British tabloids, and the whole paper is thinner as well.

In June 2012, Bild celebrated its 60th anniversary by giving away free newspapers to almost all of Germany&#x27;s 41 million households. Bild said &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; in Germany has certified the print run as &quot;the largest circulation for the free special edition of a newspaper&quot;. In 2018 on average 2.2 million copies of the paper were printed across Germany and 416,567 readers took advantage of the paid digital offer Bild plus. In terms of subscribers, it is the largest in Europe and the fifth largest worldwide.

In 2019 Bild started a weekly politic newspaper, named &quot;Bild Politik&quot;, which ceased publications after a few months.

===Editorial leanings===
From the outset, the editorial drift was conservative and nationalist. The GDR was referred to as the Soviet Occupation Zone (German: &quot;Sowjetische Besatzungszone&quot; or &quot;SBZ&quot;). The usage continued well into the 1980s, when &quot;Bild&quot; began to use the GDR&#x27;s official name cautiously, putting it in quotation marks. &quot;Bild&quot; (along with fellow Springer tabloid &quot;B.Z.&quot;) heavily influenced public opinion against the German student movement and left-wing terrorism in the years following 1966, and was blamed by some for the climate that contributed to the assassination attempt on activist Rudi Dutschke in 1968—a popular catchphrase in left-wing circles sympathetic to student radicalism was &quot;Bild hat mitgeschossen!&quot; (&quot;Bild shot at him too!&quot;).

In 1977 investigative journalist Günter Wallraff worked for four months as an editor for the &quot;Bild&quot; tabloid in Hanover, giving himself the pseudonym of &quot;Hans Esser&quot;. In his books &quot;Der Aufmacher&quot; (&quot;Lead Story&quot;) and &quot;Zeugen der Anklage&quot; (&quot;Witnesses for the Prosecution&quot;) he portrays his experiences on the editorial staff of the paper and the journalism which he encountered there. The staff commonly displayed contempt for humanity, a lack of respect for the privacy of ordinary people and widespread conduct of unethical research and editing techniques. Wallraff&#x27;s investigations were also the basis for the 1990 film &quot;The Man Inside&quot;.

After the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War in Europe, &quot;Bild&quot; focused on celebrity stories and became less political. Despite its general support for Germany&#x27;s conservative parties and especially former chancellor Helmut Kohl, its rhetoric, still populist in tone, is less fierce than it was thirty years ago. Its traditionally less conservative Sunday paper &quot;Bild am Sonntag&quot; even supported Gerhard Schröder, a Social Democrat, in his bid for chancellor in 1998.

In 2004, &quot;Bild&quot; started to cooperate with fast-food giant McDonald&#x27;s to sell the tabloid at its 1,000 fast-food restaurants in Germany. The cooperation still goes on, often enough by advertising the restaurant chain in &quot;news&quot; articles. Photos of young, topless women appeared on &quot;Bild&#x27;s&quot; page one below the fold as &quot;Seite-eins-Mädchen&quot; or &quot;Page One Girls&quot;. On 9 March 2012 &quot;Bild&quot; announced the elimination of the &quot;Page One Girls&quot;, instead moving its suggestive photos to its inside pages.

In 2004 &quot;Bild&quot; was publicly reprimanded twelve times by the (German Press Council). This amounts for a third of the reprimands this self-regulation council of the German press declared that year. Up until 2012, it had received more reprimands than any other newspaper from this watchdog body.

After Julian Reichelt became editor in 2018, &quot;Bild&quot; took a generally anti-Angela Merkel line, and strengthened its anti-Putin, pro-NATO, pro-Israel position.

The left-leaning &quot;Spiegel&quot; magazine often accuses &quot;Bild&quot; of pushing Germany further right and questions &quot;Bild&quot;″s moral standards and journalistic quality.

====International relations====
*During the COVID-19 pandemic, &quot;Bild&quot; editor Julian Reichelt accused Chinese leader Xi Jinping of surveillance and other human rights crimes in an editorial titled &quot;What China owes us&quot; on 20 April 2020. After the Chinese embassy to Germany said that the &quot;Bild&quot; editorial reproached &quot;nationalism, prejudice, and hostility against China&quot;, Reichelt responded &quot;You [Xi], your government and your scientists had to know long ago that coronavirus is highly infectious, but you left the world in the dark about it.&quot;
* During the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, Paul Ronzheimer, the deputy editor-in-chief and correspondent of &quot;Bild&quot;, tweeted that Ilham Aliyev, the President of Azerbaijan, agreed to be interviewed by the newspaper, and that he suddenly changed his mind, specifying that the Azerbaijani side itself offered to conduct an interview with Aliyev. Then, aide to the Azerbaijani President, Hikmet Hajiyev, responded with a tweet, calling his statement unprofessional and stating that Aliyev preferred to give interviews to professionals rather than the yellow press.

==Motto==
Its motto, prominently displayed below the logo, is &quot;unabhängig, überparteilich&quot; (&quot;independent, nonpartisan&quot;). Another slogan used prominently in advertising is &quot;Bild dir deine Meinung!&quot;, which translates as &quot;Form your own opinion!&quot; (by reading &quot;Bild&quot;), a pun based on the fact that, in German, &quot;Bild&quot; is a homophone of the imperative form of the verb &quot;bilden&quot; () and the noun &quot;Bild&quot; ().

==Print locations==
&quot;Bild&quot; is printed in Ahrensburg, Hanover, Berlin, Leipzig, Essen, Neu-Isenburg, Esslingen, Munich, and Syke. Outside of Germany it is also printed in Madrid, Palma de Mallorca, Las Palmas, Milan, Athens, and in Antalya. The foreign locations cater mostly for German tourists and expatriates.

==Reception==
&quot;Der Spiegel&quot; wrote in 2006 that&quot; Bild&quot; &quot;flies just under the nonsense threshold of American and British tabloids ... For the German desperate, it is a daily dose of high-resolution soft porn&quot;.

It is argued &quot;Bild&quot;&#x27;s thirst for sensationalism results in the terrorizing of prominent celebrities and stories are frequently based on the most dubious evidence. The journalistic standards of &quot;Bild&quot; are the subject of frequent criticism.

 is a popular German blog that when founded was dedicated solely to documenting errors and fabrications in &quot;Bild&quot; articles. In 2005 BILDblog received the &quot;Grimme Online Award&quot; for its work. Since 2009 BILDblog has also reported on errors and fabrications in other newspapers from Germany and elsewhere.

Heinrich Böll&#x27;s 1974 novel &quot;The Lost Honor of Katharina Blum&quot;, and the 1975 movie based on it, used a fictional stand-in for &quot;Bild&quot; to make a point about its allegedly unethical journalistic practices. Böll&#x27;s essay in the edition of 10 January 1972 of &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; (titled &quot;) was sharply critical of Bild&#x27;s sensationalist coverage of the Baader-Meinhof Gang. In the essay, Böll stated that what &quot;Bild&quot; does &quot;isn&#x27;t cryptofascist anymore, not fascistoid, but naked fascism. Agitation, lies, dirt.&quot;

Judith Holofernes, lead singer of German band &quot;Wir sind Helden&quot;, wrote a scathing open letter to Bild&#x27;s advertising agency after they asked her to star in a campaign. &quot;Bild is not a harmless guilty pleasure&quot;, she wrote, but a &quot;dangerous political instrument—not only a high-magnification telescope into the abyss but an evil creature&quot;.

Writer Max Goldt has described the paper as &quot;an organ of infamy&quot; and posited that &quot;one has to be as impolite to its editors as is legally possible; they are bad people who do wrong&quot;.

===Images of topless women===
For 28 years from 1984 to 2012, &quot;Bild&quot; had topless women featuring on its first page; in total, the paper published more than 5,000 topless pictures.

In 2014 Sophia Becker and Kristina Lunz launched a campaign, Stop &quot;Bild&quot; Sexism, to end the use of sexualized images of women in Bild. The campaign was inspired by the No More Page 3 campaign to get &quot;The Sun&quot; in the United Kingdom to stop publishing images of half-naked women on page 3. Lunz argues that &quot;Bild&quot;&#x27;s frequent use of images of unclothed women makes its reporting of sexual assault and harassment &quot;sexist and voyeuristic.&quot; Becker says that &quot;Bild&quot; contributes to the normalisation of sexism in German society. The petition had over 35,000 signatures in January 2015, and Springer, the newspaper&#x27;s publisher, responded by issuing a statement of values. These include the importance of mutual respect and maintaining respectful interactions. &quot;Bild&quot; stopped publishing &quot;topless productions of our own with women&quot; in March 2018, three years after &quot;The Sun&quot;, while continuing to publish photos of provocatively-posed models dressed in underwear alone.

== TV ==
In 2021, the Bild television channel was created.

==In popular culture==

* In their 2007 song &quot;Lasse redn&quot; (topped at no. 6 of the German charts), punk rock band &quot;Die Ärzte&quot; summarized &quot;Bild&quot;&#x27;s content as &quot;fear, hate, tits and the weather report&quot; ().

* Bild Lilli was the inspiration for Ruth Handler&#x27;s Barbie doll.

==Building==
The Berlin offices have a 19-storey paternoster lift, whose continued operation was vigorously defended editorially by the newspaper.

<text>François Marie Charles Fourier (; ; 7 April 1772 – 10 October 1837) was a French philosopher, an influential early socialist thinker, and one of the founders of utopian socialism. Some of his views, held to be radical in his lifetime, have become mainstream in modern society. For instance, Fourier is credited with having originated the word &quot;feminism&quot; in 1837.

Fourier&#x27;s social views and proposals inspired a whole movement of intentional communities. Among them in the United States were the community of Utopia, Ohio; La Reunion near present-day Dallas, Texas; Lake Zurich, Illinois; the North American Phalanx in Red Bank, New Jersey; Brook Farm in West Roxbury, Massachusetts; the Community Place and Sodus Bay Phalanx in New York State; Silkville, Kansas, and several others. In Guise, France, he influenced the . Fourier later inspired a diverse array of revolutionary thinkers and writers.

==Life==
Fourier was born in Besançon, France, on 7 April 1772. The son of a small businessman, Fourier was more interested in architecture than in his father&#x27;s trade. He wanted to become an engineer, but the local military engineering school accepted only sons of noblemen. Fourier later said he was grateful that he did not pursue engineering because it would have taken too much time away from his efforts to help humanity.

When his father died in 1781, Fourier received two-fifths of his father&#x27;s estate, valued at more than 200,000 francs. This enabled Fourier to travel throughout Europe at his leisure. In 1791 he moved from Besançon to Lyon, where he was employed by the merchant M. Bousquet. Fourier&#x27;s travels also brought him to Paris, where he worked as the head of the Office of Statistics for a few months. From 1791 to 1816 Fourier was employed in Paris, Rouen, Lyon, Marseille, and Bordeaux. As a traveling salesman and correspondence clerk, his research and thought was time-limited: he complained of &quot;serving the knavery of merchants&quot; and the stupefaction of &quot;deceitful and degrading duties.&quot; 

He began writing. His first book was published in 1808 but sold few copies. After six years, it fell into the hands of Monsieur Just Muiron, who eventually became Fourier&#x27;s patron. Fourier produced most of his writings between 1816 and 1821. In 1822, he tried to sell his books again but with no success.

Fourier died in Paris in 1837.

==Ideas==
Fourier declared that concern and cooperation are the keys to social success. He believed that a society that cooperated would see an immense improvement in its productivity. Workers would be recompensed for their labor according to their contribution. Fourier saw such cooperation occurring in communities he called &quot;phalanxes&quot;, based upon structures called Phalanstères or &quot;grand hotels&quot;. These buildings were four-level apartment complexes where the richest had the uppermost apartments and the poorest had ground-floor residences. Wealth was determined by one&#x27;s job; jobs were assigned based on interest and desire. There were incentives: jobs people might not enjoy doing would receive higher pay. Fourier considered trade, which he associated with Jews, the &quot;source of all evil&quot;, and advocated that Jews be forced to perform farm work in the phalansteries. By the end of his life, Fourier advocated the return of Jews to Palestine with the assistance of the Rothschilds. John K. Roth and Richard L. Rubenstein see Fourier as motivated by economic and religious antisemitism rather than the racial antisemitism that emerged later in the century.
===Attack on civilization===
Fourier characterized poverty (not inequality) as the principal cause of disorder in society, and proposed to eradicate it by sufficiently high wages and a &quot;decent minimum&quot; for those unable to work. He used the word &quot;civilization&quot; in a pejorative sense; as such, &quot;Fourier&#x27;s contempt for the respectable thinkers and ideologies of his age was so intense that he always used the terms philosopher and civilization in a pejorative sense. In his lexicon civilization was a depraved order, a synonym for perfidy and constraint ... Fourier&#x27;s attack on civilization had qualities not to be found in the writing of any other social critic of his time.&quot;

===Work and liberated passions===
For Herbert Marcuse &quot;The idea of libidinal work relations in a developed industrial society finds little support in the tradition of thought, and where such support is forthcoming it seems of a dangerous nature. The transformation of labor into pleasure is the central idea in Fourier&#x27;s giant socialist utopia.&quot;

Fourier believed that there were 12 common passions, which resulted in 810 types of character, so the ideal phalanx would have 1,620 people. One day there would be six million of these, loosely ruled by a world &quot;omniarch&quot;, or (later) a World Congress of Phalanxes. He had a concern for the sexually rejected; jilted suitors would be led away by a corps of &quot;fairies&quot; who would soon cure them of their lovesickness, and visitors could consult the card-index of &quot;personality types&quot; for suitable partners for casual sex. He also defended homosexuality as a personal preference for some people. Anarchist Hakim Bey describes Fourier&#x27;s ideas as follows: 
In Fourier&#x27;s system of Harmony all creative activity including industry, craft, agriculture, etc. will arise from liberated passion—this is the famous theory of &quot;attractive labor.&quot; Fourier sexualizes work itself—the life of the Phalanstery is a continual orgy of intense feeling, intellection, &amp; activity, a society of lovers &amp; wild enthusiasts.

===Women&#x27;s rights===
Fourier supported women&#x27;s rights. He believed that all important jobs should be open to women on the basis of skill and aptitude rather than closed on account of gender. He spoke of women as individuals, not as half the human couple. Fourier saw that &quot;traditional&quot; marriage could potentially hurt woman&#x27;s rights as human beings and thus never married. Writing before the advent of the term &quot;homosexuality&quot;, he held that both men and women have a wide range of sexual needs and preferences, which may change throughout their lives, including same-sex attraction and &quot;androgénité&quot;. He argued that all sexual expressions should be enjoyed as long as people are not abused, and that &quot;affirming one&#x27;s difference&quot; can actually enhance social integration.

Fourier&#x27;s concern was to liberate every human being, in two senses: through education and by liberating human passion.

===Children and education===
Fourier felt that &quot;civilized&quot; parents and teachers saw children as little idlers. But he himself believed that children as early as age two and three were very industrious. He listed children&#x27;s dominant tastes as including:

#Rummaging or inclination to handle everything, examine everything, look through everything, to constantly change occupations;
#Industrial commotion, taste for noisy occupations;
#Aping or imitative mania.
#Industrial miniature, a taste for miniature workshops.
#Progressive attraction of the weak toward the strong.

=== Utopian aspirations ===
Fourier was deeply disturbed by the disorder of his time and wanted to stabilize the course of events. He saw a world full of strife, chaos, and disorder.

Fourier is best remembered for his writings on a new world order based on unity of action and harmonious collaboration. He is also known for certain utopian pronouncements, such as that the seas would lose their salinity and turn to lemonade, and a coincidental view of climate change, that the North Pole would be milder than the Mediterranean in a future phase of Perfect Harmony.
===Antisemitism===

Fourier said Jews were &quot;the leprosy and the ruin of the body politic&quot;. He criticized the government for being weak and &quot;prostrate&quot; when confronted with what he called a &quot;secret and indissoluble league&quot; of Jews. Post-Medieval antisemitic rhetoric often accused Jews of being unable to assimilate into a unitary national culture (highly valued by the French nationalists). Fourier was one of the writers to argue that Jews were disloyal and would not make good French citizens. Like others, he placed great significance on the religious restrictions prohibiting Jews from eating at the same table as non-Jews:

he confined himself to sitting down at table and drinking; he refused to eat any of the dishes, because they were prepared by Christians. Christians have to be very patient to tolerate such impertinence. In the Jewish religion it denotes a system of defiance and aversion for other sects. Now, does a sect which wishes to carry its hatred as far as the table of its protectors, deserve to be protected?

== Influence ==

The influence of Fourier&#x27;s ideas in French politics carried forward into the 1848 Revolution and the Paris Commune by followers such as Victor Considerant.

*Numerous references to Fourierism appear in Dostoevsky&#x27;s political novel &quot;Demons,&quot; published in 1872.
*Fourier&#x27;s ideas also took root in America, with his followers starting phalanxes throughout the country, including one of the most famous, Utopia, Ohio.
*Fourier is one of three major utopian socialists whose ideas are critiqued in Friedrich Engels&#x27;s .
*Peter Kropotkin, in the preface to his book &quot;The Conquest of Bread&quot;, considered Fourier the founder of the libertarian branch of socialist thought, as opposed to the authoritarian socialist ideas of Babeuf and Buonarroti.
*In the mid-20th century, Fourier&#x27;s influence began to rise again among writers reappraising socialist ideas outside the Marxist mainstream. After the Surrealists broke with the French Communist Party, André Breton returned to Fourier, writing &quot;Ode à Charles Fourier&quot; in 1947.
*Walter Benjamin considered Fourier crucial enough to devote an entire &quot;konvolut&quot; of his massive, projected book on the Paris arcades, the &quot;Passagenwerk&quot;, to Fourier&#x27;s thought and influence. He writes: &quot;To have instituted play as the canon of a labor no longer rooted in exploitation is one of the great merits of Fourier&quot;, and notes that &quot;Only in the summery middle of the nineteenth century, only under its sun, can one conceive of Fourier&#x27;s fantasy materialized.&quot;
*Herbert Marcuse in his influential work &quot;Eros and Civilization&quot; wrote, &quot;Fourier comes closer than any other utopian socialist to elucidating the dependence of freedom on non-repressive sublimation.&quot;
*In 1969, Raoul Vaneigem quoted and adapted Fourier&#x27;s &quot;Avis aux civilisés relativement à la prochaine métamorphose sociale&quot; in his text &quot;Avis aux civilisés relativement à l&#x27;autogestion généralisée&quot;.

*Fourier&#x27;s work significantly influenced the writings of Gustav Wyneken, Guy Davenport (in his work of fiction &quot;Apples and Pears&quot;), Peter Lamborn Wilson, and Paul Goodman.
*In Whit Stillman&#x27;s film &quot;Metropolitan&quot;, the idealistic Tom Townsend describes himself as a Fourierist, and debates the success of social experiment Brook Farm with another character. Bidding him goodnight, Sally Fowler says, &quot;Good luck with your furrierism.&quot; 
*David Harvey, in the appendix to his book &quot;Spaces of Hope&quot;, offers a personal utopian vision of the future in cities citing Fourier&#x27;s ideas.
*Libertarian socialist and environmentalist thinker Murray Bookchin wrote that &quot;The Greek ideal of the rounded citizen in a rounded environment—one that reappeared in Charles Fourier’s utopian works—was long cherished by the anarchists and socialists of the last century...The opportunity of the individual to devote his or her productive activity to many different tasks over an attenuated work week (or in Fourier’s ideal society, over a given day) was seen as a vital factor in overcoming the division between manual and intellectual activity, in transcending status differences that this major division of work created, and in enhancing the wealth of experiences that came with a free movement from industry through crafts to food cultivation.&quot;
*Nathaniel Hawthorne in Chapter 7 of his novel &quot;The Blithedale Romance&quot; gently mocks Fourier, writing: 
*Writers of the post-left anarchy tendency have praised Fourier&#x27;s work. Bob Black in his work &quot;The Abolition of Work&quot; advocates Fourier&#x27;s idea of attractive work as a solution to his criticisms of work conditions in contemporary society. Hakim Bey wrote that Fourier &quot;lived at the same time as De Sade &amp; [William] Blake, &amp; deserves to be remembered as their equal or even superior. Those other two apostles of freedom &amp; desire had no political disciples, but in the middle of the 19th century literally hundreds of communes (phalansteries) were founded on fourierist principles&quot;.

<text>Sustainable living describes a lifestyle that attempts to reduce the use of Earth&#x27;s natural resources by an individual or society. Its practitioners often attempt to reduce their ecological footprint (including their carbon footprint) by altering their home designs and methods of transportation, energy consumption and diet. Its proponents aim to conduct their lives in ways that are consistent with sustainability, naturally balanced, and respectful of humanity&#x27;s symbiotic relationship with the Earth&#x27;s natural ecology. The practice and general philosophy of ecological living closely follows the overall principles of sustainable development.

One approach to sustainable living, exemplified by small-scale urban transition towns and rural ecovillages, seeks to create self-reliant communities based on principles of simple living, which maximize self-sufficiency, particularly in food production. These principles, on a broader scale, underpin the concept of a bioregional economy.

==Definition==

Sustainable living is fundamentally the application of sustainability to lifestyle choices and decisions. One conception of sustainable living expresses what it means in triple-bottom-line terms as meeting present ecological, societal, and economical needs without compromising these factors for future generations. Another broader conception describes sustainable living in terms of four interconnected &quot;social&quot; domains: economics, ecology, politics, and culture. In the first conception, sustainable living can be described as living within the innate carrying capacities defined by these factors. In the second or Circles of Sustainability conception, sustainable living can be described as negotiating the relationships of needs within limits across all the interconnected domains of social life, including consequences for future human generations and non-human species.

Sustainable design and sustainable development are critical factors to sustainable living. Sustainable design encompasses the development of appropriate technology, which is a staple of sustainable living practices. Sustainable development in turn is the use of these technologies in infrastructure. Sustainable architecture and agriculture are the most common examples of this practice.

Lester R. Brown, a prominent environmentalist and founder of the Worldwatch Institute and Earth Policy Institute, describes sustainable living in the twenty-first century as &quot;shifting to a renewable energy-based, reuse/recycle economy with a diversified transport system.&quot; Anitra Nelson notes that the Degrowth movement has &quot;pointed to ‘growth’ and ‘growth economies’ as the source of inequities and unsustainabilities&quot; with the result that advocates call for &quot;a radical reduction in production and consumption, greater citizen participation in politics, and more diversity, especially within ecological systems and landscapes, along with a flourishing of creativity, care, and commoning — using renewable energy and materials. Derrick Jensen (&quot;the poet-philosopher of the ecological movement&quot;), a celebrated American author, radical environmentalist and prominent critic of mainstream environmentalism argues that &quot;industrial civilization is not and can never be sustainable&quot;. From this statement, the natural conclusion is that sustainable living is at odds with industrialization. Thus, practitioners of the philosophy potentially face the challenge of living in an industrial society and adapting alternative norms, technologies, or practices.

==History==
* 1954 The publication of &quot;Living the Good Life&quot; by Helen and Scott Nearing marked the beginning of the modern day sustainable living movement. The publication paved the way for the &quot;back-to-the-land movement&quot; in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
* 1962 The publication of &quot;Silent Spring&quot; by Rachel Carson marked another major milestone for the sustainability movement.
* 1972 Donella Meadows wrote the international bestseller &quot;The Limits to Growth&quot;, which reported on a study of long-term global trends in population, economics and the environment. It sold millions of copies and was translated into 28 languages.
* 1973 E. F. Schumacher published a collection of essays on shifting towards sustainable living through the appropriate use of technology in his book &quot;Small Is Beautiful&quot;.
* 1992–2002 The United Nations held a series of conferences, which focused on increasing sustainability within societies to conserve the Earth&#x27;s natural resources. The Earth Summit conferences were held in 1992, 1972 and 2002.
* 2007 the United Nations published &quot;Sustainable Consumption and Production, Promoting Climate-Friendly Household Consumption Patterns&quot;, which promoted sustainable lifestyles in communities and homes.

==Shelter==

On a global scale, shelter is associated with about 25% of the greenhouse gas emissions embodied in household purchases and 26% of households&#x27; land use.

Sustainable homes are built using sustainable methods, materials, and facilitate green practices, enabling a more sustainable lifestyle. Their construction and maintenance have neutral impacts on the Earth. Often, if necessary, they are close in proximity to essential services such as grocery stores, schools, daycares, work, or public transit making it possible to commit to sustainable transportation choices. Sometimes, they are off-the-grid homes that do not require any public energy, water, or sewer service.

If not off-the-grid, sustainable homes may be linked to a grid supplied by a power plant that is using sustainable power sources, buying power as is normal convention. Additionally, sustainable homes may be connected to a grid, but generate their own electricity through renewable means and sell any excess to a utility. There are two common methods to approaching this option: net metering and double metering.

Net metering uses the common meter that is installed in most homes, running forward when power is used from the grid, and running backward when power is put into the grid (which allows them to &quot;net&quot; out their total energy use, putting excess energy into the grid when not needed, and using energy from the grid during peak hours, when you may not be able to produce enough immediately). Power companies can quickly purchase the power that is put back into the grid, as it is being produced. Double metering involves installing two meters: one measuring electricity consumed, the other measuring electricity created. Additionally, or in place of selling their renewable energy, sustainable home owners may choose to bank their excess energy by using it to charge batteries. This gives them the option to use the power later during less favorable power-generating times (i.e.: night-time, when there has been no wind, etc.), and to be completely independent of the electrical grid.

Sustainably designed (see Sustainable Design) houses are generally sited so as to create as little of a negative impact on the surrounding ecosystem as possible, oriented to the sun so that it creates the best possible microclimate (typically, the long axis of the house or building should be oriented east–west), and provide natural shading or wind barriers where and when needed, among many other considerations. The design of a sustainable shelter affords the options it has later (i.e.: using passive solar lighting and heating, creating temperature buffer zones by adding porches, deep overhangs to help create favorable microclimates, etc.) Sustainably constructed houses involve environmentally friendly management of waste building materials such as recycling and composting, use non-toxic and renewable, recycled, reclaimed, or low-impact production materials that have been created and treated in a sustainable fashion (such as using organic or water-based finishes), use as much locally available materials and tools as possible so as to reduce the need for transportation, and use low-impact production methods (methods that minimize effects on the environment).

In April 2019, New York City passed a bill to cut greenhouse gas emissions. The bill&#x27;s goal was to minimize the climate pollution stemming from the hub that is New York City. It was approved in a 42 to 5 vote, showing a strong favor of the bill. The bill will restrict energy use in larger buildings. The bill imposes greenhouse gas caps on buildings that are over 25,000 square feet. The calculation of the exact cap is done by square feet per building. A similar emission cap had existed already for buildings of 50,000 square feet or more. This bill expands the legislation to cover more large buildings. The bill protects rent-regulated buildings of which there are around 990,000. Due to the implementation of the bill, around 23,000 new green jobs will be created. The bill received support from Mayor Bill de Blasio. New York is taking action based on the recognition that their climate pollution has effects far beyond the city limits of New York. In discussion of a possible new Amazon headquarters in NYC, De Blasio specified that the bill applies to everyone, regardless of prestige. Mayor de Blasio also announced a lawsuit by the city (of New York) to five major oil companies due to their harm on the environment and climate pollution. This also raises the question of the possible closing of the 24 oil and gas burning power plants in New York City, due to the aimed declining use of these sources of energy. With the emission cap, New York will likely see a turn to renewable energy sources. It is possible that these plants will be transitioned to hubs of renewable energy to power the city. This new bill will go into action in three years (2022) and is estimated to cut climate pollution by 40% in eight years (by 2030).

Many materials can be considered a &quot;green&quot; material until its background is revealed. Any material that has used toxic or carcinogenic chemicals in its treatment or manufacturing (such as formaldehyde in glues used in woodworking), has traveled extensively from its source or manufacturer, or has been cultivated or harvested in an unsustainable manner might not be considered green. In order for any material to be considered green, it must be resource efficient, not compromise indoor air quality or water conservation, and be energy efficient (both in processing and when in use in the shelter). Resource efficiency can be achieved by using as much recycled content, reusable or recyclable content, materials that employ recycled or recyclable packaging, locally available material, salvaged or remanufactured material, material that employs resource efficient manufacturing, and long-lasting material as possible.

===Sustainable building materials===
Some building materials might be considered &quot;sustainable&quot; by some definitions and under certain conditions. For example, wood might be thought of as sustainable if it is grown using sustainable forest management, processed using sustainable energy, delivered by sustainable transport, etc. Under different conditions, however, it might not be considered as sustainable. The following materials might be considered as sustainable under certain conditions, based on a Life-cycle assessment:

*Adobe
*Bamboo
*Cellulose insulation
*Clay
*Cob
*Composite wood (when made from reclaimed hardwood sawdust and reclaimed or recycled plastic)
*Compressed earth block
*Cordwood
*Cork
*Hemp
*Insulating concrete forms
*Lime render
*Linoleum
*Lumber from Forest Stewardship Council approved sources
*Natural Rubber
*Natural fiber (coir, wool, jute, etc.)
*Organic cotton insulation
*Papercrete
*Rammed earth
*Reclaimed stone
*Reclaimed brick
*Recycled metal
*Recycled concrete
*Recycled paper
*Soy-based adhesive
*Soy insulation
*Straw Bale
*Structural insulated panel
*Wood

Insulation of a sustainable home is important because of the energy it conserves throughout the life of the home. Well insulated walls and lofts using green materials are a must as it reduces or, in combination with a house that is well designed, eliminates the need for heating and cooling altogether. Installation of insulation varies according to the type of insulation being used. Typically, lofts are insulated by strips of insulating material laid between rafters. Walls with cavities are done in much the same manner. For walls that do not have cavities behind them, solid-wall insulation may be necessary which can decrease internal space and can be expensive to install. Energy-efficient windows are another important factor in insulation. Simply assuring that windows (and doors) are well sealed greatly reduces energy loss in a home. Double or Triple glazed windows are the typical method to insulating windows, trapping gas or creating a vacuum between two or three panes of glass allowing heat to be trapped inside or out. Low-emissivity or Low-E glass is another option for window insulation. It is a coating on windowpanes of a thin, transparent layer of metal oxide and works by reflecting heat back to its source, keeping the interior warm during the winter and cool during the summer. Simply hanging heavy-backed curtains in front of windows may also help their insulation. &quot;Superwindows,&quot; mentioned in Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution, became available in the 1980s and use a combination of many available technologies, including two to three transparent low-e coatings, multiple panes of glass, and a heavy gas filling. Although more expensive, they are said to be able to insulate four and a half times better than a typical double-glazed windows.

Equipping roofs with highly reflective material (such as aluminum) increases a roof&#x27;s albedo and will help reduce the amount of heat it absorbs, hence, the amount of energy needed to cool the building it is on. Green roofs or &quot;living roofs&quot; are a popular choice for thermally insulating a building. They are also popular for their ability to catch storm-water runoff and, when in the broader picture of a community, reduce the heat island effect (see urban heat island) thereby reducing energy costs of the entire area. It is arguable that they are able to replace the physical &quot;footprint&quot; that the building creates, helping reduce the adverse environmental impacts of the building&#x27;s presence.

Energy efficiency and water conservation are also major considerations in sustainable housing. If using appliances, computers, HVAC systems, electronics, or lighting the sustainable-minded often look for an Energy Star label, which is government-backed and holds stricter regulations in energy and water efficiency than is required by law. Ideally, a sustainable shelter should be able to completely run the appliances it uses using renewable energy and should strive to have a neutral impact on the Earth&#x27;s water sources

Greywater, including water from washing machines, sinks, showers, and baths may be reused in landscape irrigation and toilets as a method of water conservation. Likewise, rainwater harvesting from storm-water runoff is also a sustainable method to conserve water use in a sustainable shelter. Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems replicate the natural systems that clean water in wildlife and implement them in a city&#x27;s drainage system so as to minimize contaminated water and unnatural rates of runoff into the environment.

See related articles in: LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design)
and also it is one of the most important factor of sustainable lifestyle.

==Power==
As mentioned under Shelter, some sustainable households may choose to produce their own renewable energy, while others may choose to purchase it through the grid from a power company that harnesses sustainable sources (also mentioned previously are the methods of metering the production and consumption of electricity in a household). Purchasing sustainable energy, however, may simply not be possible in some locations due to its limited availability. 6 out of the 50 states in the US do not offer green energy, for example. For those that do, its consumers typically buy a fixed amount or a percentage of their monthly consumption from a company of their choice and the bought green energy is fed into the entire national grid. Technically, in this case, the green energy is not being fed directly to the household that buys it. In this case, it is possible that the amount of green electricity that the buying household receives is a small fraction of their total incoming electricity. This may or may not depend on the amount being purchased. The purpose of buying green electricity is to support their utility&#x27;s effort in producing sustainable energy. Producing sustainable energy on an individual household or community basis is much more flexible, but can still be limited in the richness of the sources that the location may afford (some locations may not be rich in renewable energy sources while others may have an abundance of it).

When generating renewable energy and feeding it back into the grid (in participating countries such as the US and Germany), producing households are typically paid at least the full standard electricity rate by their utility and are also given separate renewable energy credits that they can then sell to their utility, additionally (utilities are interested in buying these renewable energy credits because it allows them to claim that they produce renewable energy). In some special cases, producing households may be paid up to four times the standard electricity rate, but this is not common.

Solar power harnesses the energy of the sun to make electricity. Two typical methods for converting solar energy into electricity are photo-voltaic cells that are organized into panels and concentrated solar power, which uses mirrors to concentrate sunlight to either heat a fluid that runs an electrical generator via a steam turbine or heat engine, or to simply cast onto photo-voltaic cells. The energy created by photo-voltaic cells is a direct current and has to be converted to alternating current before it can be used in a household. At this point, users can choose to either store this direct current in batteries for later use, or use an AC/DC inverter for immediate use. To get the best out of a solar panel, the angle of incidence of the sun should be between 20 and 50 degrees. Solar power via photo-voltaic cells are usually the most expensive method to harnessing renewable energy, but is falling in price as technology advances and public interest increases. It has the advantages of being portable, easy to use on an individual basis, readily available for government grants and incentives, and being flexible regarding location (though it is most efficient when used in hot, arid areas since they tend to be the most sunny). For those that are lucky, affordable rental schemes may be found. Concentrated solar power plants are typically used on more of a community scale rather than an individual household scale, because of the amount of energy they are able to harness but can be done on an individual scale with a parabolic reflector.

Solar thermal energy is harnessed by collecting direct heat from the sun. One of the most common ways that this method is used by households is through solar water heating. In a broad perspective, these systems involve well insulated tanks for storage and collectors, are either passive or active systems (active systems have pumps that continuously circulate water through the collectors and storage tank) and, in active systems, involve either directly heating the water that will be used or heating a non-freezing heat-transfer fluid that then heats the water that will be used. Passive systems are cheaper than active systems since they do not require a pumping system (instead, they take advantage of the natural movement of hot water rising above cold water to cycle the water being used through the collector and storage tank).

Other methods of harnessing solar power are solar space heating (for heating internal building spaces), solar drying (for drying wood chips, fruits, grains, etc.), solar cookers, solar distillers, and other passive solar technologies (simply, harnessing sunlight without any mechanical means).

Wind power is harnessed through turbines, set on tall towers (typically 20’ or 6m with 10‘ or 3m diameter blades for an individual household&#x27;s needs) that power a generator that creates electricity. They typically require an average of wind speed of 9 mi/hr (14 km/h) to be worth their investment (as prescribed by the US Department of Energy), and are capable of paying for themselves within their lifetimes. Wind turbines in urban areas usually need to be mounted at least 30’ (10m) in the air to receive enough wind and to be void of nearby obstructions (such as neighboring buildings). Mounting a wind turbine may also require permission from authorities. Wind turbines have been criticized for the noise they produce, their appearance, and the argument that they can affect the migratory patterns of birds (their blades obstruct passage in the sky). Wind turbines are much more feasible for those living in rural areas and are one of the most cost-effective forms of renewable energy per kilowatt, approaching the cost of fossil fuels, and have quick paybacks.

For those that have a body of water flowing at an adequate speed (or falling from an adequate height) on their property, hydroelectricity may be an option. On a large scale, hydroelectricity, in the form of dams, has adverse environmental and social impacts. When on a small scale, however, in the form of single turbines, hydroelectricity is very sustainable. Single water turbines or even a group of single turbines are not environmentally or socially disruptive. On an individual household basis, single turbines are the probably the only economically feasible route (but can have high paybacks and is one of the most efficient methods of renewable energy production). It is more common for an eco-village to use this method rather than a singular household.

Geothermal energy production involves harnessing the hot water or steam below the earth&#x27;s surface, in reservoirs, to produce energy. Because the hot water or steam that is used is reinjected back into the reservoir, this source is considered sustainable. However, those that plan on getting their electricity from this source should be aware that there is controversy over the lifespan of each geothermal reservoir as some believe that their lifespans are naturally limited (they cool down over time, making geothermal energy production there eventually impossible). This method is often large scale as the system required to harness geothermal energy can be complex and requires deep drilling equipment. There do exist small individual scale geothermal operations, however, which harness reservoirs very close to the Earth&#x27;s surface, avoiding the need for extensive drilling and sometimes even taking advantage of lakes or ponds where there is already a depression. In this case, the heat is captured and sent to a geothermal heat pump system located inside the shelter or facility that needs it (often, this heat is used directly to warm a greenhouse during the colder months). Although geothermal energy is available everywhere on Earth, practicality and cost-effectiveness varies, directly related to the depth required to reach reservoirs. Places such as the Philippines, Hawaii, Alaska, Iceland, California, and Nevada have geothermal reservoirs closer to the Earth&#x27;s surface, making its production cost-effective.

Biomass power is created when any biological matter is burned as fuel. As with the case of using green materials in a household, it is best to use as much locally available material as possible so as to reduce the carbon footprint created by transportation. Although burning biomass for fuel releases carbon dioxide, sulfur compounds, and nitrogen compounds into the atmosphere, a major concern in a sustainable lifestyle, the amount that is released is sustainable (it will not contribute to a rise in carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere). This is because the biological matter that is being burned releases the same amount of carbon dioxide that it consumed during its lifetime. However, burning biodiesel and bioethanol (see biofuel) when created from virgin material, is increasingly controversial and may or may not be considered sustainable because it inadvertently increases global poverty, the clearing of more land for new agriculture fields (the source of the biofuel is also the same source of food), and may use unsustainable growing methods (such as the use of environmentally harmful pesticides and fertilizers).

===List of organic matter that can be burned for fuel===

*Bagasse
*Biogas
*Manure
*Stover
*Straw
*Used vegetable oil
*Wood

Digestion of organic material to produce methane is becoming an increasingly popular method of biomass energy production. Materials such as waste sludge can be digested to release methane gas that can then be burnt to produce electricity. Methane gas is also a natural by-product of landfills, full of decomposing waste, and can be harnessed here to produce electricity as well. The advantage in burning methane gas is that is prevents the methane from being released into the atmosphere, exacerbating the greenhouse effect. Although this method of biomass energy production is typically large scale (done in landfills), it can be done on a smaller individual or community scale as well.

==Food==
Globally, food accounts for 48% and 90% of household environmental impacts on land and water resources respectively, with consumption of meat, dairy and processed food rising quickly with income.

===Environmental impacts of industrial agriculture===

Industrial agricultural production is highly resource and energy intensive. Industrial agriculture systems typically require heavy irrigation, extensive pesticide and fertilizer application, intensive tillage, concentrated monoculture production, and other continual inputs. As a result of these industrial farming conditions, today&#x27;s mounting environmental stresses are further exacerbated. These stresses include: declining water tables, chemical leaching, chemical runoff, soil erosion, land degradation, loss in biodiversity, and other ecological concerns.

===Conventional food distribution and long distance transport===

Conventional food distribution and long-distance transport are additionally resource and energy exhaustive. Substantial climate-disrupting carbon emissions, boosted by the transport of food over long distances, are of growing concern as the world faces such global crisis as natural resource depletion, peak oil and climate change. &quot;The average American meal currently costs about 1500 miles, and takes about 10 calories of oil and other fossil fuels to produce a single calorie of food.&quot;

===Local and seasonal foods===

A more sustainable means of acquiring food is to purchase locally and seasonally. Buying food from local farmers reduces carbon output, caused by long-distance food transport, and stimulates the local economy. Local, small-scale farming operations also typically utilize more sustainable methods of agriculture than conventional industrial farming systems such as decreased tillage, nutrient cycling, fostered biodiversity and reduced chemical pesticide and fertilizer applications. Adapting a more regional, seasonally based diet is more sustainable as it entails purchasing less energy and resource demanding produce that naturally grow within a local area and require no long-distance transport. These vegetables and fruits are also grown and harvested within their suitable growing season. Thus, seasonal food farming does not require energy intensive greenhouse production, extensive irrigation, plastic packaging and long-distance transport from importing non-regional foods, and other environmental stressors. Local, seasonal produce is typically fresher, unprocessed and argued to be more nutritious. Local produce also contains less to no chemical residues from applications required for long-distance shipping and handling. Farmers&#x27; markets, public events where local small-scale farmers gather and sell their produce, are a good source for obtaining local food and knowledge about local farming productions. As well as promoting localization of food, farmers markets are a central gathering place for community interaction. Another way to become involved in regional food distribution is by joining a local community-supported agriculture (CSA). A CSA consists of a community of growers and consumers who pledge to support a farming operation while equally sharing the risks and benefits of food production. CSA&#x27;s usually involve a system of weekly pick-ups of locally farmed vegetables and fruits, sometimes including dairy products, meat and special food items such as baked goods. Considering the previously noted rising environmental crisis, the United States and much of the world is facing immense vulnerability to famine. Local food production ensures food security if potential transportation disruptions and climatic, economical, and sociopolitical disasters were to occur.

===Reducing meat consumption===

Industrial meat production also involves high environmental costs such as land degradation, soil erosion and depletion of natural resources, especially pertaining to water and food. Mass meat production increase the amount of methane in the atmosphere. For more information on the environmental impact of meat production and consumption, see the ethics of eating meat. Reducing meat consumption, perhaps to a few meals a week, or adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet, alleviates the demand for environmentally damaging industrial meat production. Buying and consuming organically raised, free range or grass fed meat is another alternative towards more sustainable meat consumption.

===Organic farming===

Purchasing and supporting organic products is another fundamental contribution to sustainable living. Organic farming is a rapidly emerging trend in the food industry and in the web of sustainability. According to the USDA National Organic Standards Board (NOSB), organic agriculture is defined as &quot;an ecological production management system that promotes and enhances biodiversity, biological cycles, and soil biological activity. It is based on minimal use of off-farm inputs and on management practices that restore, maintain, or enhance ecological harmony. The primary goal of organic agriculture is to optimize the health and productivity of interdependent communities of soil life, plants, animals and people.&quot; Upon sustaining these goals, organic agriculture uses techniques such as crop rotation, permaculture, compost, green manure and biological pest control. In addition, organic farming prohibits or strictly limits the use of manufactured fertilizers and pesticides, plant growth regulators such as hormones, livestock antibiotics, food additives and genetically modified organisms. Organically farmed products include vegetables, fruit, grains, herbs, meat, dairy, eggs, fibers, and flowers. See organic certification for more information.

===Urban gardening===

In addition to local, small-scale farms, there has been a recent emergence in urban agriculture expanding from community gardens to private home gardens. With this trend, both farmers and ordinary people are becoming involved in food production. A network of urban farming systems helps to further ensure regional food security and encourages self-sufficiency and cooperative interdependence within communities. With every bite of food raised from urban gardens, negative environmental impacts are reduced in numerous ways. For instance, vegetables and fruits raised within small-scale gardens and farms are not grown with tremendous applications of nitrogen fertilizer required for industrial agricultural operations. The nitrogen fertilizers cause toxic chemical leaching and runoff that enters our water tables. Nitrogen fertilizer also produces nitrous oxide, a more damaging greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Local, community-grown food also requires no imported, long-distance transport which further depletes our fossil fuel reserves. In developing more efficiency per land acre, urban gardens can be started in a wide variety of areas: in vacant lots, public parks, private yards, church and school yards, on roof tops (roof-top gardens), and many other places. Communities can work together in changing zoning limitations in order for public and private gardens to be permissible. Aesthetically pleasing edible landscaping plants can also be incorporated into city landscaping such as blueberry bushes, grapevines trained on an arbor, pecan trees, etc. With as small a scale as home or community farming, sustainable and organic farming methods can easily be utilized. Such sustainable, organic farming techniques include: composting, biological pest control, crop rotation, mulching, drip irrigation, nutrient cycling and permaculture. For more information on sustainable farming systems, see sustainable agriculture.

===Food preservation and storage===

Preserving and storing foods reduces reliance on long-distance transported food and the market industry. Home-grown foods can be preserved and stored outside of their growing season and continually consumed throughout the year, enhancing self-sufficiency and independence from the supermarket. Food can be preserved and saved by dehydration, freezing, vacuum packing, canning, bottling, pickling and jellying. For more information, see food preservation.

==Transportation==

With rising concerns over non-renewable energy source usage and climate change caused by carbon emissions, the phase-out of fossil fuel vehicles is becoming more and more important to the conversation of sustainability. Zero-emission urban transport systems that foster mobility, accessible public transportation and healthier urban environments are needed. Such urban transport systems should consist of rail transport, electric buses, bicycle pathways, provision for human-powered transport and pedestrian walkways. Public transport systems such as underground rail systems and bus transit systems shift huge numbers of people away from reliance on car dependency and dramatically reduce the rate of carbon emissions caused by automobile transport.

In comparison to automobiles, bicycles are a paragon of energy efficient personal transportation with the bicycle roughly 50 times more energy efficient than driving. Bicycles increase mobility while alleviating congestion, lowering air and noise pollution, and increasing physical exercise. Most importantly, they do not emit climate-damaging carbon dioxide. Bike-sharing programs are beginning to boom throughout the world and are modeled in leading cities such as Paris, Amsterdam and London. Bike-sharing programs offer kiosks and docking stations that supply hundreds to thousands of bikes for rental throughout a city through small deposits or affordable memberships.

A recent boom has occurred in electric bikes especially in China and other Asian countries. Electric bikes are similar to electric cars in that they are battery-powered and can be plugged into the provincial electric grid for recharging as needed. In contrast to electric cars, electric bikes do not directly use any fossil fuels. Adequate sustainable urban transportation is dependent upon proper city transport infrastructure and planning that incorporates efficient public transit along with bicycle and pedestrian-friendly pathways.

==Water==
A major factor of sustainable living involves that which no human can live without, water. Unsustainable water use has far reaching implications for humankind. Currently, humans use one-fourth of the Earth&#x27;s total fresh water in natural circulation, and over half the accessible runoff. Additionally, population growth and water demand is ever increasing. Thus, it is necessary to use available water more efficiently. In sustainable living, one can use water more sustainably through a series of simple, everyday measures. These measures involve considering indoor home appliance efficiency, outdoor water use, and daily water use awareness.

===Indoor home appliances===

Housing and commercial buildings account for 12 percent of America&#x27;s freshwater withdrawals. A typical American single family home uses about per person per day indoors. This use can be reduced by simple alterations in behavior and upgrades to appliance quality.

====Toilets====

Toilets accounted for almost 30% of residential indoor water use in the United States in 1999. One flush of a standard U.S. toilet requires more water than most individuals, and many families, in the world use for all their needs in an entire day.
A home&#x27;s toilet water sustainability can be improved in one of two ways: improving the current toilet or installing a more efficient toilet. To improve the current toilet, one possible method is to put weighted plastic bottles in the toilet tank. Also, there are inexpensive tank banks or float booster available for purchase. A tank bank is a plastic bag to be filled with water and hung in the toilet tank. A float booster attaches underneath the float ball of pre-1986 three and a half gallon capacity toilets. It allows these toilets to operate at the same valve and float setting but significantly reduces their water level, saving between one and one and a third gallons of water per flush. A major waste of water in existing toilets is leaks. A slow toilet leak is undetectable to the eye, but can waste hundreds of gallons each month. One way to check this is to put food dye in the tank, and to see if the water in the toilet bowl turns the same color. In the event of a leaky flapper, one can replace it with an adjustable toilet flapper, which allows self-adjustment of the amount of water per flush.

In installing a new toilet there are a number of options to obtain the most water efficient model. A low flush toilet uses one to two gallons per flush. Traditionally, toilets use three to five gallons per flush. If an eighteen-liter per flush toilet is removed and a six-liter per flush toilet is put in its place, 70% of the water flushed will be saved while the overall indoor water use by will be reduced by 30%. It is possible to have a toilet that uses no water. A composting toilet treats human waste through composting and dehydration, producing a valuable soil additive. These toilets feature a two-compartment bowl to separate urine from feces. The urine can be collected or sold as fertilizer. The feces can be dried and bagged or composted. These toilets cost scarcely more than regularly installed toilets and do not require a sewer hookup. In addition to providing valuable fertilizer, these toilets are highly sustainable because they save sewage collection and treatment, as well as lessen agricultural costs and improve topsoil.

Additionally, one can reduce toilet water sustainability by limiting total toilet flushing. For instance, instead of flushing small wastes, such as tissues, one can dispose of these items in the trash or compost.

====Showers====

On average, showers were 18% of U.S. indoor water use in 1999, at per minute traditionally in America. A simple method to reduce this use is to switch to low-flow, high-performance showerheads. These showerheads use only 1.0–1.5 gpm or less. An alternative to replacing the showerhead is to install a converter. This device arrests a running shower upon reaching the desired temperature. Solar water heaters can be used to obtain optimal water temperature, and are more sustainable because they reduce dependence on fossil fuels. To lessen excess water use, water pipes can be insulated with pre-slit foam pipe insulation. This insulation decreases hot water generation time. A simple, straightforward method to conserve water when showering is to take shorter showers. One method to accomplish this is to turn off the water when it is not necessary (such as while lathering) and resuming the shower when water is necessary. This can be facilitated when the plumbing or showerhead allow turning off the water without disrupting the desired temperature setting (common in the UK but not the United States).

====Dishwashers and sinks====

On average, sinks were 15% of U.S. indoor water use in 1999. There are, however, easy methods to rectify excessive water loss. Available for purchase is a screw-on aerator. This device works by combining water with air thus generating a frothy substance with greater perceived volume, reducing water use by half. Additionally, there is a flip-valve available that allows flow to be turned off and back on at the previously reached temperature. Finally, a laminar flow device creates a 1.5–2.4 gpm stream of water that reduces water use by half, but can be turned to normal water level when optimal.

In addition to buying the above devices, one can live more sustainably by checking sinks for leaks, and fixing these links if they exist. According to the EPA, &quot;A small drip from a worn faucet washer can waste 20 gallons of water per day, while larger leaks can waste hundreds of gallons&quot;. When washing dishes by hand, it is not necessary to leave the water running for rinsing, and it is more efficient to rinse dishes simultaneously.

On average, dishwashing consumes 1% of indoor water use. When using a dishwasher, water can be conserved by only running the machine when it is full. Some have a &quot;low flow&quot; setting to use less water per wash cycle. Enzymatic detergents clean dishes more efficiently and more successfully with a smaller amount of water at a lower temperature.

====Washing machines====

On average, 23% of U.S. indoor water use in 1999 was due to clothes washing. In contrast to other machines, American washing machines have changed little to become more sustainable. A typical washing machine has a vertical-axis design, in which clothes are agitated in a tubful of water. Horizontal-axis machines, in contrast, put less water into the bottom of the rub and rotate clothes through it. These machines are more efficient in terms of soap use and clothing stability.

===Outdoor water use===

There are a number of ways one can incorporate a personal yard, roof, and garden in more sustainable living. While conserving water is a major element of sustainability, so is sequestering water.

====Conserving water====

In planning a yard and garden space, it is most sustainable to consider the plants, soil, and available water. Drought resistant shrubs, plants, and grasses require a smaller amount of water in comparison to more traditional species. Additionally, native plants (as opposed to herbaceous perennials) will use a smaller supply of water and have a heightened resistance to plant diseases of the area. Xeriscaping is a technique that selects drought-tolerant plants and accounts for endemic features such as slope, soil type, and native plant range. It can reduce landscape water use by 50 – 70%, while providing habitat space for wildlife. Plants on slopes help reduce runoff by slowing and absorbing accumulated rainfall. Grouping plants by watering needs further reduces water waste.

After planting, placing a circumference of mulch surrounding plants functions to lessen evaporation. To do this, firmly press two to four inches of organic matter along the plant&#x27;s dripline. This prevents water runoff. When watering, consider the range of sprinklers; watering paved areas is unnecessary. Additionally, to conserve the maximum amount of water, watering should be carried out during early mornings on non-windy days to reduce water loss to evaporation. Drip-irrigation systems and soaker hoses are a more sustainable alternative to the traditional sprinkler system. Drip-irrigation systems employ small gaps at standard distances in a hose, leading to the slow trickle of water droplets which percolate the soil over a protracted period. These systems use 30 – 50% less water than conventional methods. Soaker hoses help to reduce water use by up to 90%. They connect to a garden hose and lay along the row of plants under a layer of mulch. A layer of organic material added to the soil helps to increase its absorption and water retention; previously planted areas can be covered with compost.

In caring for a lawn, there are a number of measures that can increase the sustainability of lawn maintenance techniques. A primary aspect of lawn care is watering. To conserve water, it is important to only water when necessary, and to deep soak when watering. Additionally, a lawn may be left to go dormant, renewing after a dry spell to its original vitality.

====Sequestering water====

A common method of water sequestrations is rainwater harvesting, which incorporates the collection and storage of rain. Primarily, the rain is obtained from a roof, and stored on the ground in catchment tanks. Water sequestration varies based on extent, cost, and complexity. A simple method involves a single barrel at the bottom of a downspout, while a more complex method involves multiple tanks. It is highly sustainable to use stored water in place of purified water for activities such as irrigation and flushing toilets. Additionally, using stored rainwater reduces the amount of runoff pollution, picked up from roofs and pavements that would normally enter streams through storm drains. The following equation can be used to estimate annual water supply:

Collection area (square feet) × Rainfall (inch/year) / 12 (inch/foot) = Cubic Feet of Water/Year

Cubic Feet/Year × 7.43 (Gallons/Cubic Foot) = Gallons/year

Note, however, this calculation does not account for losses such as evaporation or leakage.

Greywater systems function in sequestering used indoor water, such as laundry, bath and sink water, and filtering it for reuse. Greywater can be reused in irrigation and toilet flushing. There are two types of greywater systems: gravity fed manual systems and package systems. The manual systems do not require electricity but may require a larger yard space. The package systems require electricity but are self-contained and can be installed indoors.

==Waste==

As populations and resource demands climb, waste production contributes to emissions of carbon dioxide, leaching of hazardous materials into the soil and waterways, and methane emissions. In America alone, over the course of a decade, of American resources will have been transformed into nonproductive wastes and gases. Thus, a crucial component of sustainable living is being waste conscious. One can do this by reducing waste, reusing commodities, and recycling.

There are a number of ways to reduce waste in sustainable living. Two methods to reduce paper waste are canceling junk mail like credit card and insurance offers and direct mail marketing and changing monthly paper statements to paperless emails. Junk mail alone accounted for 1.72 million tons of landfill waste in 2009. Another method to reduce waste is to buy in bulk, reducing packaging materials. Preventing food waste can limit the amount of organic waste sent to landfills producing the powerful greenhouse gas methane. Another example of waste reduction involves being cognizant of purchasing excessive amounts when buying materials with limited use like cans of paint. Non-hazardous or less hazardous alternatives can also limit the toxicity of waste.

By reusing materials, one lives more sustainably by not contributing to the addition of waste to landfills. Reusing saves natural resources by decreasing the necessity of raw material extraction. For example, reusable bags can reduce the amount of waste created by grocery shopping eliminating the need to create and ship plastic bags and the need to manage their disposal and recycling or polluting effects.

Recycling, a process that breaks down used items into raw materials to make new materials, is a particularly useful means of contributing to the renewal of goods. Recycling incorporates three primary processes; collection and processing, manufacturing, and purchasing recycled products. A natural example of recycling involves using food waste as compost to enrich the quality of soil, which can be carried out at home or locally with community composting. An offshoot of recycling, upcycling, strives to convert material into something of similar or greater value in its second life. By integrating measures of reusing, reducing, and recycling one can effectively reduce personal waste and use materials in a more sustainable manner.

== Reproductive choices ==
Though it is not always included in discussions of sustainable living, some consider reproductive choices to be a key part of sustainable living. Reproductive choices refers, in this case, to the number of children that an individual has, whether they are conceived biologically or adopted. Some researchers have claimed that for people living in wealthy, high-consumption countries such as the United States, having fewer children is by far the most effective way to decrease one&#x27;s carbon footprint, and one&#x27;s ecological footprint more broadly. However, the scholarship that has led to this claim has been questioned, as has the misleading way that it&#x27;s often been presented in popular newspaper and web articles. Some ethicists and environmental activists have made similar arguments about the need for a &quot;small family ethic&quot; and research has found that in some countries, these ecological concerns are leading some people to report having fewer children than they would otherwise, or no children at all.

However, there have been multiple critiques of the idea that having fewer children is part of a sustainable lifestyle. Some argue that it is an example of the kind of Malthusian thinking that has led to coercion and violence in the past (including forced sterilizations and forced abortions), and that it might lead to similar policies that deny women reproductive freedom in the future. Additionally, research has found that some environmentalists consider having children, and even having more children than they might otherwise, to be a part of sustainable living. They assert that parenting can be an important way that individuals can exert a positive environmental influence, by educating the next generation and as a way to remain engaged in one&#x27;s commitment to environmental action.

== Provision, supply and expenditure in general ==
A study that reviewed 217 analyses of on-the-market products and services and analyzed existing alternatives to mainstream food, holidays, and furnishings, concluded that total greenhouse gas emissions by Swedes could be lowered by as of 2021 up to 36–38 % if consumers – without a decrease in total estimated expenditure or considerations of self-interest rationale – instead were to obtain those they – using available data – could assess to be more sustainable. Provision, supply/availability, product development/success/price, comparative benefits as well as incentives, purposes/demands and effects of expenditure-choices are part of or embedded in the human neuro-socioeconomic system and therefore overall largely beyond the control of an individual seeking to make rational and ethical choices within it even if all relevant life-cycle assessment/product and manufacturing information was available to this consumer.

<text>Euronews (stylised in lowercase) is a pan-European television news network, headquartered in Lyon, France. It is a provider of livestreamed news, which can be viewed in Europe and North Africa via satellite, and in most of the world via its website, on YouTube, and on various mobile devices and digital media players.

The network began broadcasting on the new year, 1 January 1993 and covers world news from a European perspective. Euronews is currently majority-owned by Alpac Capital, a company indirectly linked to the Hungarian government of Viktor Orbán.

==History==
===Timeline===
====Background====

In 1992, following the Persian Gulf War, during which CNN&#x27;s position as the preeminent source of 24-hour news programming was cemented, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) proposed a channel to present information from a counterpart European perspective.

Euronews was founded by a consortium of ten EBU members (national public broadcasters), titled SOCEMIE ():

*CyBC, Cyprus
*ERTU, Egypt
*France Télévisions, France
*RAI, Italy
*RTBF, Belgium
*RTP, Portugal
*RTVE, Spain
*TMC, Monaco
*Yle, Finland
The Swiss public broadcaster SRG SSR was admitted later as a non-founding member. The BBC and German public broadcasters ARD and ZDF opted not to join.

The channel&#x27;s headquarters was to be established in Lyon, which was chosen from a variety of candidates also including Munich, Bologna and Valencia.

==== Launch, geographic and linguistic expansion (1993–2015) ====
The inaugural Euronews broadcast was on 1 January 1993 from Écully, Lyon. In 1996, an additional broadcast studio was set up in London.

In late 1997, the British news broadcaster ITN purchased a 49% share of Euronews for £5.1 million from Alcatel-Lucent. ITN supplied the content of the channel along with the remaining shareholders.

A part-time Arabic-language service was briefly operated from April 1997, with a two-year grant from the European Commission, comprising eight journalists and freelancers. After the tender expired, it ceased broadcasting on 15 April 1999.

In 1999, the broadcast switched from solely analogue to mainly digital transmission. The same year, a Portuguese audio track was added.

In 2001, the All-Russia State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company (VGTRK) acquired a 1.8% stake in SOCEMIE. A Russian-language service was launched later in the year.

In April 2003, ITN sold its stake in Euronews as part of its drive to streamline operations and focus on news-gathering rather than channel management.

On 6 February 2006, Ukrainian public broadcaster Natsionalna Telekompanya Ukraïny purchased a one percent interest in SOCEMIE.

In 2007, Euronews won the European Commission&#x27;s tender for an Arabic-language news channel, with a service agreement being signed on 6 December. A new Arabic service would eventually be launched in July 2008.

On 27 May 2008, Spanish public broadcaster RTVE decided to withdraw from the Euronews consortium, citing legal requirements to maintain low debt levels through careful spending and prioritisation of its existing international channel as a factor influencing its decision to leave. In February 2009, Turkish public broadcaster TRT purchased 15.70% of the channel&#x27;s shares and became the fourth main partner after France Télévisions (23.93%), RAI (21.54%), and VGTRK (16.94%), while also joining its supervisory board.

New language services included Turkish in January 2010, Persian in October 2010, and Ukrainian in August 2011. 

A short-lived Polish service was launched in mid-2011 to mark Poland&#x27;s assumption of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, although only some selected evening broadcasts were translated. It was discontinued in January 2012. The service was briefly reestablished in September 2012 in the form of a 15-minute programme broadcast on private television channel TTV three times a day during weekdays. The Polish service survived in this form until the end of 2013. 

The channel began broadcasting in widescreen in January 2011, in concert with France 24.

==== Media Globe Networks ownership (2015–2016) ====

In February 2015, the channel&#x27;s executive board approved a bid by Media Globe Networks, owned by Egyptian telecom magnate Naguib Sawiris, to acquire a 53% controlling stake in the media outlet. The deal raised questions over Euronews&#x27;s future editorial posture and independence.

On 13 March 2015, it was announced that Inter Media Group, owned by pro-Russian Ukrainian oligarch Dmytro Firtash, had purchased the Ukrainian service. In response, the government of Ukraine, citing suspected bias, revoked its broadcasting license and dropped its funding. Firtash later abandoned the project, resulting in the department shutting down and leaving 17 journalists redundant. The Russian service, which was financed by the government of Russia, refused to provide jobs to the journalists, violating French labour legislation. The management explained that not hiring any Ukrainian journalists was a specific instruction from VGTRK.

In October 2015, Euronews moved to a new headquarters complex in the Lyon district of , designed by Paris-based architecture firm Jakob + MacFarlane and covering a floor area of 10,000 m2 (2 acres). The decision to move was announced in 2011, prior to the Media Globe Networks purchase.

In 2016, Euronews SA was co-owned by Media Globe Networks, regional authorities (Lyon Metropolis, Rhône, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes) and the following broadcasters:
*ČT, Czech Republic
*CyBC, Cyprus
*ENTV, Algeria
*ERTU, Egypt
*ERT, Greece
*ETT, Tunisia
*France Télévisions, France
*PBS, Malta
*RAI, Italy
*RTBF, Belgium
*RTÉ, Ireland
*RTP, Portugal
*RTVSLO, Slovenia
*SNRT, Morocco
*SRG SSR, Switzerland
*TRT, Turkey
*TV4, Sweden
*TVR, Romania
*UA:PBC, Ukraine
*VGTRK, Russia
*Yle, Finland
==== NBC partnership (2016–2022) ====

In November 2016, the channel&#x27;s executive board was in talks with NBCUniversal, the parent company of NBC News, for a &quot;strategic partnership&quot;. NBCU would acquire 15 to 30% ownership of the Euronews network, would contribute to Euronews content, and facilitate NBC News&#x27; expanded operations in Europe. After successful negotiations with the European Commission, who feared that the partnership would result in an &quot;Americanization&quot; of Euronews, the NBCUniversal News Group finalised its purchase of a 25% stake in Euronews in February 2017 for €25 million ($30 million). NBC News president Deborah Turness was appointed to head up international operations, and incumbent Euronews CEO Michael Peters, who had led it since 2004, became CEO of the new partnership. Both reported directly to NBC News chairman Andrew Lack. The resulting partnership became known as Euronews NBC.

Although Naguib Sawiris and NBC News had the largest stakes in Euronews, editorial control by SOCEMIE members was assured, with the broadcasters having seven slots in the editorial board, as opposed to Sawiris&#x27; company (which has three slots) and NBC News, which only has one, thereby reducing rumors of an &quot;Americanization&quot; of Euronews&#x27; values. Editorial control is fully handled by Euronews&#x27; teams, with NBC only focusing on planning and coordinating tasks. After the formation of the partnership, video reports from NBC News&#x27; properties and correspondents began to appear frequently on the TV channel and reports from NBCNews.com began to be distributed on its digital platforms.

On 9 May 2017, Euronews began a process of splitting its services into twelve separate editions for each language, of which nine have a linear TV channel retaining their respective voiceover, but now including the on-screen ticker and most lower thirds in the local language. The &quot;glocal&quot; strategy allows the language editorial teams to personalize the content and presentation of their channel, not only by sharing own-produced content with other languages but by producing content that is relevant to local audiences and allowing local reporters and presenters to appear on camera in all its language editions. The splitting process finished on 24 May 2017.

The language split resulted in the discontinuation of satellite distribution for the newly-created German, Spanish, Portuguese and Turkish channels, now being only available via fiber-optic IP uplink. The discontinuation of the German-language channel on satellite in particular generated outcry from many German satellite TV owners, resulting in its restoration on the Astra 1L satellite on 25 July 2017, via an unencrypted SD feed sitting alongside the French-language channel. Additionally, the Arabic and Persian-language editions were relegated to an online-only distribution on Euronews&#x27; website and apps and major social media networks, with TV broadcasting being discontinued. This later also applied for the Turkish-language edition, following discontinued support from TRT, who wanted to prioritise its own international news channel, TRT World. Furthermore, the Ukrainian edition was discontinued outright, due to lack of funding from the Ukrainian government, as well as due to the controversy surrounding the ownership of its broadcasting licence. Finally, the Euronews channel in English would become known as the &quot;World&quot; edition, and distribution to premises in the American continent via fiber-optic IP uplink was set to begin later in 2018. These changes caused the elimination of 43 staff positions, mainly from the Ukrainian edition, causing major layoffs and leading to production staff having more flexible roles.
In 2018, Euronews&#x27; English-language channel began to gradually revamp its programming schedule, with the roll-out of a new slate of presenter-led programming to complement its already existing shows, a move that was reported earlier in the year, after the success of its presenter-led special reports and weekly programming introduced in recent years. Alongside conventional rolling news shows with newsreaders, debate programming, talk shows, and new presenter-led long-form shows began to be offered during the weekly schedule, and throughout programs, Euronews reporters from different nationalities will be offering context on stories close to their respective home nationalities.

The roll-out began on 22 May, when Euronews debuted the first of these new shows, &quot;Good Morning Europe&quot;, a five-hour morning show which airs every weekday morning from 7 am. It was first anchored by former RT correspondent and TVB Pearl news presenter Tesa Arcilla, who anchored it on a temporary basis. Some weeks later, former France 24 presenter Belle Donati began presenting the show, alternating with Arcilla; after she moved to Brussels in September, she became the main anchor of the slot. Two months later, on 17 July, Euronews debuted a six-hour breaking news show, &quot;Euronews Now&quot;, anchored by Tokunbo Salako, covering the dayside and afternoon slots. On 3 September, the new evening program lineup was launched, starting with a politics-focused show, &quot;Raw Politics&quot;, hosted from Brussels by Tesa Arcilla, and featuring former Sky News reporter Darren McCaffrey. It also spawned a weekly spin-off, &quot;Raw Politics: Your Call&quot;, a phone-in show which featured European Parliament members answering viewers&#x27; questions by phone or social media. The show was dropped over a year later, in October 2019, due to low viewership, with its content being integrated into the rolling news programming. Two weeks after the launch of &quot;Raw Politics&quot;, on 17 September, the full roll-out was completed with the introduction of a 5-hour evening rolling news show, &quot;Euronews Tonight&quot;, initially presented by former Sky News and BBC News presenter Sam Naz, and later by Euronews veteran Isabelle Kumar, who has worked with the channel since 2003. The traditional pre-produced blocks of video content still remained on some late-nights and weekends. Most overnights by this point repeated the previous day&#x27;s edition (either full or half-length) of &quot;Euronews Now&quot;.

New weekly programming was also produced, including the weekly interview series &quot;Uncut&quot;, which feature conversations from political leaders and newsmakers worldwide with minimum to no editing. The first episodes featured Franco-German politician Daniel Cohn-Bendit interviewing former UKIP leader Nigel Farage and former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair about Brexit. Additionally, a new social media unit was created, with journalists with a background on digital news verification leading it. The newly created team helped to produce &quot;The Cube&quot;, a social media segment during rolling news shows, focusing on analysis on treatment and reactions about news headlines on social media, with special attention at the major stories of the day. &quot;No Comment&quot;, a long-standing element of Euronews&#x27; programming, remains on the channels&#x27; schedule, and it was gradually integrated into the rolling news shows on the English-language channel.

Additionally, a major investment in mobile reporting via iPhone devices helped Euronews gain a major scoop, becoming the only TV news outlet worldwide to broadcast live coverage from the MV &quot;Aquarius&quot;, with Paris correspondent Annelise Borges (formerly with France 24) on assignment. Borges broadcast live for 10 days as the Italian government denied the Aquarius access to Italian ports. The coverage made headlines on many news outlets worldwide and helped Euronews augment its credibility and its audience. The new Euronews also hired new correspondents in London, Berlin, Moscow, Rome, Madrid and Washington D.C., and gained access to NBC News&#x27; large network of correspondents worldwide.

As of September 2018, the other language editions were unaffected, with the pre-produced blocks of video content remaining at all times. Programming dayparts were later named with proper translations of the existing daypart programming of the World edition (i.e. the evening daypart being named &quot;Euronews am Abend&quot;, &quot;Euronews Noite&quot;, &quot;Euronews Soir&quot;...). There were plans to introduce presenter-led programming during the morning slots on these other channels, eventually, the evening daypart in most of the language-specific channels became presenter-led by late 2018; all of these editions were pre-recorded and pre-produced before broadcast, and eventually looped through the night.

By 2019, several of the newly-launched anchored programmes, including &quot;Raw Politics&quot;, had been cancelled, and the network began facing a liquidity crisis, with its estimated value having fallen to €3.7 million from its previous worth of €67 million in 2015, according to the French magazine &quot;Capital&quot;. On 20 April 2020, it was reported that NBCUniversal had sold its stake in Euronews to Media Globe Networks for €3 million, giving the latter an overall majority share of 88%. NBCUniversal&#x27;s parent company Comcast had recently acquired pan-European satellite service Sky Group, and was prioritizing a collaboration between NBC News and Sky News on a new international news channel. The proposed service was scrapped in August during the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, with the project no longer considered commercially viable.

==== Post-NBC, Alpac Capital ownership, relocation to Brussels (2022–present) ====
In November 2020, French newspaper &quot;Libération&quot; stated in an online article that Euronews had been producing an increasing amount of magazine content focusing on Dubai, and sponsored by the Dubai tourism board, which had allegedly caused staff discontent. Segments dedicated to Dubai were found to only have a brief sentence in small print indicating their sponsorship, which a Euronews spokesperson argued met French broadcast standards, rather than using the logo of the relevant institution as with other sponsored content. The article noted that this was likely a result of continued private divestment leading to influence from the International Media Investments (IMI) corporation, owned by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan of the ruling royal family of Abu Dhabi, which &quot;discreetly&quot; became a shareholder in 2017 and then signed a memorandum with Euronews the following year. The network would later conduct similar partnerships with Qatar Media City and the Saudi Tourism Authority, both state-owned, to produce relevant sponsored segments.

As part of Euronews&#x27; digital growth post-NBC, the broadcaster has launched a series of online verticals dedicated to specific areas. These include Euronews Green, Euronews Travel, Euronews Next, and Euronews Culture.

In December 2021, reports surfaced that Lisbon-based Alpac Capital would buy an 88% controlling stake in Euronews from Egyptian telecoms magnate Naguib Sawiris. The sale was met with scrutiny as Alpac is allegedly linked to Prime Minister Viktor Orbán of Hungary. Mário David, the father of Pedro Vargas David (CEO of Alpac Capital), is a long-time associate, advisor and friend to Orbán. The acquisition was partly financed by funds from the Hungarian state. According to Ágnes Urbán, director of the think tank Mertek Media Monitor, Euronews would risk being exploited as a &quot;pseudo-independent&quot; media outpost of the government of Hungary, where it maintains a semblance of independence, but takes a &quot;far less critical&quot; stance with regard to Hungary and other so-called illiberal democracies. Euronews CEO Michael Peters and several of the network&#x27;s employees subsequently affirmed that the new partnership would not encroach on its editorial independence. The purchase was finalised in July 2022, following approval from the French government.

By the end of 2022, weekday news bulletins had gradually phased out all remaining in-vision presenting, reverting to the traditional voiceover format; some cancelled shows were reportedly still cited in programme guides. Four veteran shareholders within the network — founding public broadcasters France Télévisions, RTBF and RAI, as well as SRG SSR — had withdrawn from its capital by September 2022. As of July 2023, Euronews now lists only four shareholders on its &quot;About us&quot; page, with Alpac Capital&#x27;s share at 97.6%.

In early 2023, the channel&#x27;s on-air identity and schedule was refreshed to mark the network&#x27;s thirtieth anniversary, with less emphasis on in-vision presenting introduced in 2018. The on-screen branding, tailored to be optimised for mobile viewing, now includes a side strip of tweets sourced from different news outlets.

On 2 March 2023, the network announced it would begin relocating its principal and editorial headquarters to Brussels, creating one hundred new positions there, including 70 reserved for journalists, and eliminating 198 staff positions in Lyon in the process. 142 jobs would remain based in Lyon, including those of the Russian and Persian-language editorial teams. In addition, the previous headquarters complex in Lyon would be closed and sold. The French union said the move would lead to Euronews becoming a &quot;half empty shell&quot;, and a weakening of the &quot;pluralism of information&quot;.

At the end of 2024, euronews relaunched its Polish-language website, announcing the launch of a local service on 15 January 2025. Unlike the previous incarnation, the new Polish service is to be a permanent addition as the 18th language, which in turn is to confirm the involvement of well-known Polish journalists in the project. The launch of the service again coincided with Poland taking over the Presidency of the Council of the European Union.

The channel is available in 430 million households in 166 countries worldwide. It reaches more than 170 million European households by cable, satellite and terrestrial. It also began to secure availability on multimedia platforms such as IPTV and digital media.

Euronews launched an application for mobile devices (Android, iPhone, and iPad) which is called &quot;Euronews Live&quot;. The application is free of charge and is available on Google Play and the App Store. This app was later shut down quietly.

The channel&#x27;s programmes are also available by podcast, and it has maintained YouTube channels since October 2007.

High-definition (HD) broadcasting was started on 2 November 2016 via satellite using Hot Bird-capacities (English audio only). Regarding the audio codec, Euronews originally used the AC3 format, before changing to the AAC codec in March 2017, and changing again to the MPEG codec in April 2017.

The following broadcasters have simulcast Euronews through partial timeslots on terrestrial channels:

*Face TV (Bosnia and Herzegovina) in English
*CyBC DTV Platform (Cyprus) in English and Greek (also simulcasted by RIK 2 when its programming is over)
*ERT News (Greece) in English and Greek
*TL (Lebanon) in Arabic daily at 8:00
*RTÉ One, RTÉ2, RTÉ News (Ireland) in English
*Canal Extremadura, Aragón TV, 7RM Murcia (Spain) in Spanish
*TVM News+ (Malta) in English
In the US, the channel is available for free on the KlowdTV platform.

In 2012, the largest Belarusian state network MTIS stopped broadcasting Euronews for unknown reasons.

In 2013, the new commercial channel Planet TV started broadcasting Euronews dubbed in Slovenian after Antenna TV SL purchased a major stake in the company. Euronews airs after closedown (or sign-off) of Planet TV, but both call sign logos are displayed.

In September 2016, Euronews was removed from the Freesat channel list in the UK, in a move made by Sawiris.

In February 2023, the Saudi-based MBC Group added Euronews to its Shahid streaming platform. Satellite distribution of its French-language channel on Astra ceased at the end of the month.

In the UK, Euronews is available, together with a number of other international news channels, via online video subscription service NewsPlayer+ and alongside Africanews on Freeview channel 271 via the Channelbox free streaming service.

===Governance===
Euronews SA operates the channel and holds the broadcasting licence. As of July 2023, the Portuguese investment management firm Alpac Capital has a 97.6% stake in Euronews SA. Guillaume Dubois, a former broadcasting director at LCI, took over as CEO in June 2022. He would be later be fired in October 2024 and replaced instead by former Axel Springer Managing Director Claus Strunz.

===Africanews subsidiary===

In January 2014, Euronews announced a partnership with public broadcaster Télé Congo &quot;under the auspices of the President of the Republic of the Congo, Mr. Denis Sassou Nguesso&quot; to create an African service entitled Africanews. Initially based in Pointe-Noire, its website debuted on 4 January 2016, with the Africanews TV channel eventually launching on 20 April, broadcasting in English and French.

In January 2016, Euronews was accused of plagiarism by the Congolese media group AfricaNews, because the Lyon-based channel used the name &quot;Africanews&quot; for its African subsidiary. However, AfricaNews in the Democratic Republic of Congo has existed since 2005 and can be found on the Internet. Its employees sent letters to DRC authorities and managing director of Euronews, Michael Peters, to change the related name and to avoid using it for the African subsidiary of Euronews.

In 2020, Euronews originally planned to sell Africanews to a group known as Sipromad, but the deal eventually fell through and the two parties entered litigation. As a result, Africanews would remain under the ownership of its sister channel, but its production would move from Pointe-Noire to Euronews&#x27;s headquarters in Lyon by the end of July 2020, with a reduction in costs of at least 30%.

==Reception==
===Belarus===
In April 2021, the Ministry of Information of Belarus announced that authorities had ceased broadcasting of Euronews within its territory, with its frequencies being taken over by Channel One Russia&#x27;s Pobeda channel. A ministry spokesperson said that the channel had &quot;violated legislation by running advertisements in English, instead of Russian or Belarusian&quot;. In a statement, the network responded that they were not &quot;notified of this decision nor of the reasons for it, and learned of it this morning through the press&quot;, adding that it &quot;deeply regret[ed] the decision&quot;. A Minsk-based expert assessed that the move deprived Belarusians of an alternative &quot;to what is being broadcast by Belarusian state media and Russian television channels&quot;.

===Russia===
In May 2016, Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova accused Euronews of &quot;disinformation&quot; after an online article mistakenly embedded a tweet from a parody account claiming to be foreign minister Sergey Lavrov. Pyotr Fedorov, a member of the Euronews supervisory board representing the Russian state broadcaster VGTRK, referred to the incident as an &quot;unconscious Russophobia characteristic&quot; of English-language journalists.

An October 2016 report broadcast on Russia-1 and produced by correspondent and propagandist Evgeniy Poddubny accused Euronews of producing an &quot;anti-Russian fake about Syria&quot; in the context of the Syrian army offensive during the Battle of Aleppo.

Access to Euronews in Russia, including its online services, was restricted on orders of Roskomnadzor in late March 2022 following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The channel&#x27;s signal was then forcibly taken over by Russia-24, before the original frequencies were in turn handed over on 7 April to a new channel operated by state TV journalist Vladimir Solovyov, who was sanctioned by the European Union for his support of the invasion of Ukraine.

===Ukraine===
On 14 August 2014, Ukrainian journalist Olha Herasymyuk, then-deputy chairperson of the , described the Russian-language service of Euronews as having &quot;a propagandistic nature&quot; due to the fact that Russian journalists worked on it.

An online report published by the English-language edition of Euronews in 2018, which depicted children in Russian-annexed Crimea being trained by soldiers to defuse landmines, was criticised by Ukrainian media and officials, including Mykola Tochytskyi, Ukraine&#x27;s representative to the EU, and Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesperson Mariana Betsa, who added that reporting &quot;should be based on facts&quot;. Lithuanian foreign minister Linas Antanas Linkevičius described the online report as &quot;brainwashing&quot;.

Liubov Tsybulska, then-chair of the Centre for Strategic Communication and Information Security, said in 2021 that the &quot;influence of the Kremlin on the supposedly neutral channel is visible not only in Euronews&#x27;s Russian material, but also in the approach to the presentation of English-language news&quot;.

During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the National Council of Television and Radio Broadcasting of Ukraine appealed to Euronews leadership in June 2022, accusing the network of promoting a pro-Kremlin narrative in its Russian-language broadcasts. In a letter sent to the National Council in response, CEO Guillaume Dubois said it was &quot;unfair that one aspect would be extracted out of the overall rolling coverage to accuse our newsroom of promoting Kremlin narratives&quot;, and expressed his &quot;full solidarity&quot; with Ukraine.

<text>A forklift (also called industrial truck, lift truck, jitney, hi-lo, fork truck, fork hoist, and forklift truck) is a powered industrial truck used to lift and move materials over short distances. The forklift was developed in the early 20th century by various companies, including Clark, which made transmissions, and Yale &amp; Towne Manufacturing, which made hoists.

Since World War II, the development and use of the forklift truck has greatly expanded worldwide. Forklifts have become an indispensable piece of equipment in manufacturing and warehousing. In 2013, the top 20 manufacturers worldwide posted sales of $30.4 billion, with 944,405 machines sold.

==History==
Developments from the middle of the 19th century to the early 20th century led to today&#x27;s modern forklifts. The forerunners of the modern forklift were manually powered hoists to lift loads. In 1906, the Pennsylvania Railroad introduced battery-powered platform trucks for moving luggage at their Altoona, Pennsylvania, station.

World War I saw the development of different types of material-handling equipment in the United Kingdom by Ransomes, Sims &amp; Jefferies of Ipswich. This was in part due to the labor shortages caused by the war. In 1917, Clark in the United States began developing and using powered and lift tractors in its factories. In 1919, the Towmotor Company and, in 1920, Yale &amp; Towne Manufacturing, entered the lift truck market in the United States. Continuing development and expanded use of the forklift continued through the 1920s and 1930s. The introduction of hydraulic power and the development of the first electrically-powered forklifts, along with the use of standardized pallets in the late 1930s, helped to increase the popularity of forklift trucks.

The start of World War II, like World War I before it, spurred the use of forklift trucks in the war effort. Following the war, more efficient methods for storing products in warehouses were implemented, and warehouses needed more maneuverable forklift trucks that could reach greater heights. For example, in 1954, a British company named Lansing Bagnall, now part of KION Group, developed what was claimed to be the first narrow-aisle electric-reach truck. That development changed the design of warehouses leading to narrower aisles and higher load-stacking, which increased storage capability.

During the 1950s and 1960s, operator safety became a concern due to increasing lifting heights and capacities. Safety features such as load backrests and operator cages called overhead guards, began to be added to forklifts. In the late 1980s, ergonomic design began to be incorporated in new forklift models to improve operator comfort, reduce injuries, and increase productivity. During the 1990s, undesirable exhaust emissions from forklift operations began to be tackled, which led to emission standards being implemented for forklift manufacturers in various countries. The introduction of AC power forklifts, along with fuel cell technology, were refinements in continuing forklift development.

==General operations==
Forklifts are rated for loads at a specified maximum weight and a specified forward center of gravity. This information is located on a nameplate provided by the manufacturer, and loads must not exceed these specifications. In many jurisdictions, it is illegal to alter or remove the nameplate without the permission of the forklift manufacturer.

An important aspect of forklift operation is that it must have rear-wheel steering. While this increases maneuverability in tight cornering situations, it differs from a driver&#x27;s traditional experience with other wheeled vehicles. While steering, as there is no caster action, it is unnecessary to apply steering force to maintain a constant rate of turn.

Another critical characteristic of the forklift is its instability. The forklift and load must be considered a unit with a continually varying center of gravity with every movement of the load. A forklift must never negotiate a turn at speed with a raised load, where centrifugal and gravitational forces may combine to cause a tip-over accident. The forklift is designed with a load limit for the forks which is decreased with fork elevation and undercutting of the load (i.e., when a load does not butt against the fork &quot;L&quot;). A loading plate for loading reference is usually located on the forklift. A forklift should not be used as a personnel lift without the fitting of specific safety equipment, such as a &quot;cherry picker&quot; or &quot;cage&quot;.

Forklifts are a critical element of warehouses and distribution centers. It is considered imperative that these structures be designed to accommodate their efficient and safe movement. In the case of Drive-In/Drive-Thru Racking, a forklift needs to travel inside a storage bay that is multiple pallet positions deep to place or retrieve a pallet. Often, forklift drivers are guided into the bay by guide rails on the floor and the pallet is placed on cantilevered arms or rails. These maneuvers require well-trained operators. Since every pallet requires the truck to enter the storage structure, damage is more common than with other types of storage. In designing a drive-in system, dimensions of the fork truck, including overall width and mast width, must be carefully considered.

===Forklift control and capabilities===
Forklift hydraulics are controlled either with levers directly manipulating the hydraulic valves or by electrically controlled actuators, using smaller &quot;finger&quot; levers for control. The latter allows forklift designers more freedom in ergonomic design.

Forklift trucks are available in many variations and load capacities. In a typical warehouse setting, most forklifts have load capacities between one and five tons. Larger machines, up to 50 tons lift capacity, are used for lifting heavier loads, including loaded shipping containers.

In addition to a control to raise and lower the forks (also known as blades or tines), the operator can tilt the mast to compensate for a load&#x27;s tendency to angle the blades toward the ground and risk slipping off the forks. Tilt also provides a limited ability to operate on non-level ground. Skilled forklift operators annually compete in obstacle and timed challenges at regional forklift rodeos.

== Design types ==

=== Low lift truck ===

Powered pallet truck, usually electrically powered. Low lift trucks may be operated by a person seated on the machine, or by a person walking alongside, depending on the design.

=== Stacker ===

Usually electrically powered. A stacker may be operated by a person seated on the machine, or by a person walking alongside, depending on the design.

=== Reach truck ===

Variant on a Rider Stacker forklift, designed for narrow aisles. They are usually electrically powered and often have the highest storage-position lifting ability. A reach truck&#x27;s forks can extend to reach the load, hence the name. There are two types:

* Moving carriage. This consists of an integrated tower mast that&#x27;s fixed and the forks are mounted on a deployable carriage or pantograph, typically with hydraulic or electro-mechanical actuators or in a scissor formation. They are common in North America and parts of Europe.
* Moving mast; which consists of a slender tower mast that is mounted on tracks, allowing the entire assembly to extend or &#x27;reach&#x27; using hydraulic or electro-mechanical actuators. It also eliminates a separate fork extender pantograph. They are common in the rest of the world, and generally considered safer.

=== Counterbalanced forklift ===
Standard forklifts use a counterweight at the rear of the truck to offset, or counterbalance, the weight of a load carried at the front of the truck. Electric-powered forklifts utilise the weight of the battery as a counterweight and are typically smaller in size as a result.

=== Sideloader ===

A sideloader is a piece of materials-handling equipment designed for long loads. The operator&#x27;s cab is positioned up front on the left-hand side. The area to the right of the cab is called the bed or platform. This contains a central section within it, called the well, where the forks are positioned. The mast and forks reach out to lift the load at its central point and lower it onto the bed. Driving forwards with a load carried lengthways allows long goods, typically timber, steel, concrete or plastics, to be moved through doorways and stored more easily than via conventional forklift trucks.

=== Order-picking truck ===
Similar to a reach truck, except the operator either rides in a cage welded to the fork carriage or walks alongside, dependent on design. If the operator is riding in the order picking truck, they wear a specially-designed safety harness to prevent falls. A special toothed grab holds the pallet to the forks. The operator transfers the load onto the pallet one article at a time by hand. This is an efficient way of picking less-than-pallet-load shipments and is popular for use in large distribution centers.
=== Guided very-narrow-aisle truck ===
A counterbalance-type sit-down rider electric forklift fitted with a specialized mast assembly. The mast is capable of rotating 90 degrees, and the forks can then advance like on a reach mechanism, to pick up full pallets. Because the forklift does not have to turn, the aisles can be exceptionally narrow, and if wire guidance is fitted in the floor of the building the machine can almost work on its own. Masts on this type of machine tend to be very high. The higher the racking that can be installed, the higher the density the storage can reach. This sort of storage system is popular in cities where land prices are very high, as by building the racking up to three times higher than normal and using these machines, it is possible to stock a much larger amount of material in a building with a relatively small surface area.

=== Guided very-narrow-aisle order picking truck ===
Counterbalance-type order-picking truck similar to the guided very-narrow-aisle truck, except that the operator and the controls which operate the machine are in a cage welded to the mast. The operator wears a restraint system to protect them against falls. Otherwise, the description is the same as guided very-narrow-aisle truck.

=== Truck-mounted forklift ===
Also referred to as a &quot;sod loader&quot;. Comes in sit-down center control. Usually has an internal combustion engine. Engines are almost always diesel, but sometimes operate on kerosene, and sometimes use propane injection as a power boost. Some old units are two-stroke compression ignition; most are four-stroke compression ignition. North American engines come with advanced emission control systems. Forklifts built in countries such as Iran or Russia will typically have no emission control systems.

===Specialized trucks===
At the other end of the spectrum from the counterbalanced forklift trucks are more &#x27;high-end&#x27; specialty trucks.

==== Articulated counterbalance trucks ====
Articulating counterbalance trucks are designed to be both able to offload trailers and place the load in narrow aisle racking. The central pivot of the truck allows loads to be stored in racking at a right angle to the truck, reducing space requirements (therefore increasing pallet storage density) and eliminating double handling from yard to warehouse.

Frederick L Brown is credited with perfecting the principle of an articulated design in about 1982, receiving an award in 2002 from the UK&#x27;s Fork Lift Truck Association for Services to the Forklift Industry and the Queen&#x27;s Award for Innovation in 2003. He took inspiration from the hand pallet truck and found that by reversing the triangle of stability and changing the weight distribution he could solve the issues that had long eluded earlier attempts of articulating a forklift truck. Freddy&#x27;s patent application referenced specific drive methods, allowing competitors to enter the market by offering alternative methods, but using the same articulating principle.

==== Guided very narrow aisle trucks ====
These are rail- or wire-guided and available with lift heights up to 40 feet non-top-tied and 98 feet top-tied. Two forms are available: &#x27;man-down&#x27; and &#x27;man-riser&#x27;, where the operator elevates with the load for increased visibility or for multilevel &#x27;break bulk&#x27; order picking. This type of truck, unlike articulated narrow-aisle trucks, requires a high standard of floor flatness.

==== Marina forklifts ====
These lifts are found in places like marinas and boat storage facilities. Featuring tall masts, heavy counterweights, and special paint to resist seawater-induced corrosion, they are used to lift boats in and out of storage racks. Once out, the forklift can place the boat into the water, as well as remove it when the boating activity is finished. Marina forklifts are unique among most other forklifts in that they feature a &quot;negative lift&quot; cylinder. This type of cylinder allows the forks to actually descend lower than ground level. Such functionality is necessary, given that the ground upon which the forklift operates is higher than the water level below. Additionally, marina forklifts feature some of the longest forks available, with some up to 24 feet long. The forks are also typically coated in rubber to prevent damage to the hull of the boats that rest on them.

==== Omnidirectional trucks ====
Omnidirectional technology (such as Mecanum wheels) can allow a forklift truck to move forward, diagonally and laterally, or in any direction on a surface. An omnidirectional wheel system is able to rotate the truck 360 degrees in its own footprint or strafe sideways without turning the truck cabin.

==== UL 558 safety-rated trucks ====
In North America, some internal combustion-powered industrial vehicles carry Underwriters Laboratories ratings that are part of UL 558. Industrial trucks that are considered &quot;safety&quot; carry the designations GS (Gasoline Safety) for gasoline-powered, DS (Diesel Safety) for diesel-powered, LPS (Liquid Propane Safety) for liquified propane or GS/LPS for a dual fuel gasoline/liquified propane-powered truck.

UL 558 is a two-stage safety standard. The basic standards are referred to as G, D, LP, and G/LP. They are considered by Underwriters Laboratories to be the bare minimum required for a lift truck. This is a voluntary standard, and there is no requirement in North America at least by any Government Agency for manufacturers to meet this standard.

The slightly more stringent safety standards GS, DS, LPS, and GP/LPS do provide some minimal protection; however, it is extremely minimal. In the past, Underwriter&#x27;s Laboratory offered specialty EX and DX safety certifications.

==== UL 583 safety-rated trucks ====
UL 583 is the Electric equivalent of UL 558. As with UL 558 it is a two-stage standard.

==== Explosion-proof trucks ====
These are for operation in potentially explosive atmospheres found in chemical, petrochemical, pharmaceutical, food and drink, logistics or other fields handling flammable material. Commonly referred to as mainly Miretti or sometimes Pyroban trucks in Europe, they must meet the requirements of the ATEX 94/9/EC Directive if used in Zone 1, 2, 21 or 22 areas and be maintained accordingly.

===Automated forklift trucks===
In order to decrease work wages, reduce operational cost and improve productivity, automated forklifts have also been developed. Automated forklifts are also called forked automated guided vehicles and are already available for sale.

== Methods of propulsion ==

=== Internal combustion===
Engines may be diesel, kerosene, gasoline, natural gas, butane, or propane-fueled, and may be either two-stroke spark ignition, four-stroke spark ignition (common), two-stroke compression ignition, and four-stroke compression ignition (common). North American Engines come with advanced emission control systems. Forklifts built in countries such as Iran or Russia will typically have no emission control systems.

==== Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) ====
These forklifts use an internal combustion engine modified to run on LPG. The fuel is often stored in a gas cylinder mounted to the rear of the truck. This allows for quick changing of the cylinder once the LPG runs out. LPG trucks are quieter than their diesel counterparts, while offering similar levels of performance.

=== Battery-electric ===
Powered by lead-acid batteries or, increasingly, lithium-ion batteries; battery-electric types include: cushion-tire forklifts, scissor lifts, order pickers, stackers, reach trucks and pallet jacks. Electric forklifts are primarily used indoors on flat, even surfaces. Batteries prevent the emission of harmful fumes and are recommended for indoor facilities, such as food-processing and healthcare sectors. Forklifts have also been identified as a promising application for reuse of end-of-life automotive batteries.

===Hydrogen fuel cell===

Hydrogen fuel cell forklifts are powered by a chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen. The reaction is used to generate electricity which can then be stored in a battery and subsequently used to drive electric motors to power the forklift. This method of propulsion produces no local emissions, can be refueled in three minutes, and is often used in refrigerated warehouses as its performance is not degraded by lower temperatures. As of 2024, approximately 50,000 hydrogen forklifts are in operation worldwide (the bulk of which are in the U.S.), as compared with 1.2 million battery electric forklifts that were purchased in 2021.

==Counterbalanced forklift components==
A typical counterbalanced forklift contains the following components:
* Truck framethe base of the machine to which the mast, axles, wheels, counterweight, overhead guard and power source are attached. The frame may have fuel and hydraulic fluid tanks constructed as part of the frame assembly.
* Counterweighta mass attached to the rear of the forklift truck frame. The purpose of the counterweight is to counterbalance the load being lifted. In an electric forklift, the large battery may serve as part of the counterweight.
* Cabthe area that contains a seat for the operator along with the control pedals, steering wheel, levers, switches and a dashboard containing operator readouts. The cab area may be open-air or enclosed, but it is covered by the cage-like overhead guard assembly. When enclosed, the cab may also be equipped with a cab heater for cold climate countries along with a fan or air conditioning for hot weather.
* Overhead guarda metal roof supported by posts at each corner of the cab that helps protect the operator from any falling objects. On some forklifts, the overhead guard is an integrated part of the frame assembly.
* Power sourcemay consist of an internal combustion engine that can be powered by LP gas, CNG, gasoline or diesel fuel. Electric forklifts are powered by either a battery or fuel cell that provides power to the electric motors; some fuel cell forklifts may be powered by multiple fuel cells at once. For warehouses and other indoor applications, electric forklifts have the advantage of not producing carbon monoxide. 
* Tilt cylindershydraulic cylinders that are mounted to the truck frame and the mast. The tilt cylinders pivot the mast backwards or forwards to assist in engaging a load.
* Mastthe vertical assembly that does the work of raising and lowering the load. It is made up of interlocking rails that also provide lateral stability. The interlocking rails may either have rollers or bushings as guides. The mast is driven hydraulically, and operated by one or more hydraulic cylinders directly or using chains from the cylinder or cylinders. It may be mounted to the front axle or the frame of the forklift. A &#x27;container mast&#x27; variation allows the forks to raise a few meters without increasing the total height of the forklift. This is useful when double-loading pallets into a container or under a mezzanine floor.
* Carriagethe component to which the forks or other attachments mount. It is mounted into and moves up and down the mast rails by means of chains or by being directly attached to the hydraulic cylinder. Like the mast, the carriage may have either rollers or bushings to guide it in the interlocking mast rails.
* Load backresta rack-like extension that is either bolted or welded to the carriage in order to prevent the load from shifting backward when the carriage is lifted to full height.
* Attachmentsmay consist of a mechanism that is attached to the carriage, either permanently or temporarily, to help in the proper engagement of the load. A variety of material-handling attachments are available. Some attachments include sideshifters, slipsheet attachments, carton clamps, multipurpose clamps, rotators, fork positioners, carpet poles, pole handlers, container handlers and roll clamps.
* Tireseither solid for indoor use, or pneumatic for outside use.

===Attachments===
Below is a list of common forklift attachments:

* Dimensioning devicesfork truck-mounted dimensioning systems provide dimensions for the cargo to facilitate truck-trailer space utilization and to support warehouse automation systems. The systems normally communicate the dimensions via 802.11 radios. NTEP-certified dimensioning devices are available to support commercial activities that bill based on volume.
* Sideshiftera hydraulic attachment that allows the operator to move the tines (forks) and backrest laterally. This allows easier placement of a load without having to reposition the truck.
* Rotatorto aid the handling of skids that may have become excessively tilted, and for other specialty material-handling needs, some forklifts are fitted with an attachment that allows the tines to be rotated. This type of attachment may also be used for dumping containers for quick unloading.
* Fork positionera hydraulic attachment that moves the tines (forks) together or apart. This removes the need for the operator to manually adjust the tines for different-sized loads.
* Roll and barrel clamp attachmenta mechanical or hydraulic attachment used to squeeze the item to be moved. It is used for handling barrels, kegs, or paper rolls. This type of attachment may also have a rotate function. The rotate function would help an operator to insert a vertically-stored paper into the horizontal intake of a printing press for example.
* Pole attachmentsin some locations, such as carpet warehouses, a long metal pole is used instead of forks to lift carpet rolls. Similar devices, though much larger, are used to pick up metal coils.
* Carton and multipurpose clamp attachmentshydraulic attachments that allow the operator to open and close around a load, squeezing it to pick it up. Products like cartons, boxes and bales can be moved with this type of attachment. With these attachments in use, the forklift truck is sometimes referred to as a clamp truck.
* Slip sheet attachment (push-pull)a hydraulic attachment that reaches forward, clamps onto a slip sheet and draws the slip sheet onto wide and thin metal forks for transport. The attachment will push the slip sheet and load off the forks for placement.
* Drum handler attachmenta mechanical attachment that slides onto the tines (forks). It usually has a spring-loaded jaw that grips the top lip edge of a drum for transport. Another type grabs around the drum in a manner similar to the roll or barrel attachments.
* Man basketa lift platform that slides onto the tines (forks) and is meant for hoisting workers. The man basket has railings to keep the person from falling and brackets for attaching a safety harness. Also, a strap or chain is used to attach the man basket to the carriage of the forklift.
* Telescopic forkshydraulic attachments that allow the forklift to operate in warehouses designed for &quot;double-deep stacking&quot;, which means that two pallet shelves are placed behind each other without any aisle between them.
* Scalesfork truck-mounted scales enable operators to efficiently weigh the pallets they handle without interrupting their workflow by travelling to a platform scale. Scales are available that provide legal-for-trade weights for operations that involve billing by weight. They are easily retrofitted to the truck by hanging on the carriage in the same manner as forks hang on the truck.
* Single-double forksforks that in the closed position allow movement of a single pallet or platform but when separated, turn into a set of double forks that allow carrying two pallets side by side. The fork control may have to replace the side-shifter on some lift trucks.
* Snow plougha mechanical attachment that allows the forklift operator to easily and quickly move snow. The snow plough can often also be utilised at other times of the year as an attachment to clean up workplaces.
* Skipsa mechanical attachment that is fitted to the forklift to allow safe and speedy removal of waste to the appropriate skip or waste compactor. There are two types of skips: the roll-forward type and the bottom-emptying type.

Any attachment on a forklift will reduce its nominal load rating, which is computed with a stock fork carriage and forks. The actual load rating may be significantly lower.

===Replacing or adding attachments===

It is possible to replace an existing attachment or add one to a lift that does not already have one. Considerations include forklift type, capacity, carriage type, and number of hydraulic functions (that power the attachment features). As mentioned in the preceding section, replacing or adding an attachment may reduce (down-rate) the safe lifting capacity of the forklift truck (See also General operations, below).

Forklift attachment manufacturers offer online calculators to estimate the safe lifting capacity when using a particular attachment. However, only the forklift truck manufacturer can give accurate lifting capacities. Forklifts can be re-rated by the manufacturer and have a new specification plate attached to indicate the changed load capacity with the attachment in use.

In the context of attachment, a hydraulic function consists of a valve on the forklift with a lever near the operator that provides two passages of pressurized hydraulic oil to power the attachment features. Sometimes an attachment has more features than the forklift has hydraulic functions and one or more need to be added. There are many ways of adding hydraulic functions (also known as adding a valve). Forklift manufacturers make valves and hose routing accessories, but the parts and labor to install can be prohibitively expensive. Other ways include adding a solenoid valve in conjunction with a hose or cable reel that diverts oil flow from an existing function. However, hose and cable reels can block the operator&#x27;s view and are easily damaged.

==Lift truck associations and organizations==
There are many national as well as continental associations related to the industrial truck sector. Some of the major organizations include:
* Industrial Truck Association (ITA) (North America)
* Material Handling Equipment Distributors Association (MHEDA) (North America)
* Fédération Européenne de la Manutention – European Federation of Materials Handling (FEM)
* UK Material Handling Association (UKMHA) www.ukmha.org.uk
* Japan Industrial Vehicles Association (JIVA)
* Korean Construction Equipment Manufacturers Association (KOCEMA)

There are many significant contacts among these organizations and they have established joint statistical and engineering programs. One program is the &quot;World Industrial Trucks Statistics (WITS)&quot; which is published every month to the association memberships. The statistics are separated by area (continent), country and class of machine. While the statistics are generic and do not count production from most of the smaller manufacturers, the information is significant for its depth. These contacts have brought to a common definition of a Class System to which all the major manufacturers adhere.

==Forklift safety==
===Driver safety===
Operating a forklift can be dangerous. In the United States, approximately 7,500 workers annually are reported injured in forklift-related incidents, while nearly 100 are killed. A common hazard in manufacturing environments is forklifts striking pedestrian workers.
Forklift accidents that involve being caught in objects during loading or unloading and collisions during driving had the highest risk of injury, especially complex lower extremity injuries with a relatively high occurrence of complications.

Beyond incidents, regular forklift driving involves day-to-day demands on the body, such as postures adopted by the operators to overcome field of vision obstructions, intense mental fatigue, and excessive whole body vibrations. This can increase the risk of long-term issues including chronic pain and musculoskeletal disorders. Health care providers recommend that workers who drive or use heavy equipment such as forklifts do not treat chronic or acute pain with opioids.

===Safety products===
A number of products are available to reduce occupational hazards caused by forklifts. Forklift safety features include high-visibility seat belts, lighting to warns pedestrians that a forklift is coming and sensors that slow the vehicle to prevent collisions. 

Sensors can be used to detect pedestrians, objects, or both in a driver&#x27;s blind spots. Pedestrian detection systems are proximity sensors that detect objects and pedestrians from up to several meters away from the forklift. Ultrasonic sensors are proximity sensors typically used in the rear of the forklift. They do not discriminate between people and objects. RF systems alert forklift drivers of pedestrians carrying a radio frequency device in the forklift&#x27;s vicinity. RF systems can differentiate between people and the usual obstacles found in warehouses.

===Standards===
Forklift safety is subject to a variety of standards from governments and professional organizations. These professional organizations include the Industrial Truck Standards Development Foundation (ITSDF), National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), and International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

In the United States, workplace forklift training is governed federally by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). In 1999, OSHA updated its regulations governing forklifts, or &quot;Powered Industrial Trucks.&quot; A major component of these regulations deals with forklift operator training. The standard requires employers to develop and implement a training program. Employers must certify that each operator has received the training and evaluate each operator at least once every three years.

In the UK, the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations state that operators of forklift trucks must be adequately trained. Third-party organisations have also developed de facto &#x27;best practice&#x27; standards for forklift training, commonly referred to in the UK as a &#x27;forklift licence.&#x27; 
Qualified forklift instructors must be registered with at least one of the voluntary training organisations. 

In Australia, as of the 2011 health and safety harmonization agreement, forklift licences are classed as &quot;high-risk work licences&quot; and are issued by individual states and territories, while still governed by a federal framework. To obtain a forklift licence an applicant must complete a training course with an approved training organisation.

In New Zealand, forklift operator training is divided into operator&#x27;s certificates and forklift (F) driver license endorsements. The operator&#x27;s certificate gives permission for operators to drive a forklift in a private space. To use a forklift on a public road, the operator must obtain a forklift (F) endorsement on their driver licence. Operators with a class 1 (car) licence and an F endorsement may only operate forklifts up to 18,000 kg gross laden weight, while those holding a class 2 (medium rigid) licence and an F endorsement can operate a forklift of any gross laden weight.

<doc id="237205" wikidata="Q97342" url="?curid=237205" title="Manuel Andrack">
<text>Manuel Claus Achim Andrack (born 23 June 1965) is a German journalist, television presenter, and author. He is best known as the sidekick of the &quot;Harald Schmidt Show&quot;.

==Early years==
Andrack was born on 23 June 1965 in Cologne, where he has also lived most of his life. After receiving his Abitur in 1984 he enrolled at University of Cologne, majoring in theater studies, film, television and German studies with a minor in art history. He received a Magister Artium degree from the same university.

==Harald Schmidt Show==

Andrack first worked as an editor for the television production company &quot;CAT Entertainment RLT&quot;. In 1995, he got a job as the editor-in-chief of the popular &quot;Harald Schmidt Show&quot;. On 30 August 2000, he first appeared on-screen as Harald Schmidt&#x27;s &quot;sidekick&quot; and went on to assume the role on a regular basis, which made him widely recognised. Prior to Andrack&#x27;s on-screen introduction, Schmidt used an imaginary friend named Horst as his sidekick. The show gained new popularity as the combination Andrack/Schmidt added a family value to the broadcast.

==&quot;Creative pause&quot;==
After the show ended in December 2004, Andrack took a &quot;creative break&quot;, and wrote a book about hiking (&quot;Du musst wandern. Ohne Stock und Hut im deutschen Mittelgebirge.&quot;, 2005) (&quot;In English: You have to hike. Without hiking stick and hat in the German Central Uplands&quot;). In this book he describes his hiking experiences. Andrack quit smoking in 1997, and started jogging as a &quot;replacement drug&quot;. However, he soon developed knee problems, and had to switch to hiking, falling in love with this outdoors activity. He says he enjoys wandering with friends or with family, but prefers hiking alone. When hiking alone, he usually hikes at least 40 kilometers a day. His favourite hiking route is the Lieserpfad from Daun to Wittlich in the Eifel mountains.

During his creative pause, Andrack also wrote the book &quot;Meine Saison mit dem FC&quot; about his relationship with the football club 1. FC Köln.

==Further career==
His working life continued when Harald Schmidt made him his chief dramatic adviser, among others for his show &quot;Kabarettsprogramm&quot; in 2004–2005. When the show was reworked in 2007, Andrack disappeared from the studio, but continued as an editor-in-chief of the program, until his contract was cancelled in mutual agreement in 2008.

In 2008, Andrack moved from Cologne to Saarbrücken. Today, Andrack writes columns and articles about hiking, which are published in &quot;Stern&quot;, &quot;Die Zeit&quot; and in &quot;Wandermagazin&quot;.

==Awards==
*2001 - &quot;Grimme Online Award&quot; TV
*2002 - &quot;Botschafter des Bieres&quot; (ambassador of the beer)
*2002 - &quot;Goldene Feder&quot; (golden quill), together with Harald Schmidt

<doc id="237207" wikidata="Q76005" url="?curid=237207" title="Ultimate tensile strength">
<text>Ultimate tensile strength (also called UTS, tensile strength, TS, ultimate strength or formula_1 in notation) is the maximum stress that a material can withstand while being stretched or pulled before breaking. In brittle materials, the ultimate tensile strength is close to the yield point, whereas in ductile materials, the ultimate tensile strength can be higher.

The ultimate tensile strength is usually found by performing a tensile test and recording the engineering stress versus strain. The highest point of the stress–strain curve is the ultimate tensile strength and has units of stress. The equivalent point for the case of compression, instead of tension, is called the compressive strength.

Tensile strengths are rarely of any consequence in the design of ductile members, but they are important with brittle members. They are tabulated for common materials such as alloys, composite materials, ceramics, plastics, and wood.

== Definition ==
The ultimate tensile strength of a material is an intensive property; therefore its value does not depend on the size of the test specimen. However, depending on the material, it may be dependent on other factors, such as the preparation of the specimen, the presence or otherwise of surface defects, and the temperature of the test environment and material.

Some materials break very sharply, without plastic deformation, in what is called a brittle failure. Others, which are more ductile, including most metals, experience some plastic deformation and possibly necking before fracture.

Tensile strength is defined as a stress, which is measured as force per unit area. For some non-homogeneous materials (or for assembled components) it can be reported just as a force or as a force per unit width. In the International System of Units (SI), the unit is the pascal (Pa) (or a multiple thereof, often megapascals (MPa), using the SI prefix &quot;mega&quot;); or, equivalently to pascals, newtons per square metre (N/m2). A United States customary unit is pounds per square inch (lb/in2 or psi). Kilopounds per square inch (ksi, or sometimes kpsi) is equal to 1000 psi, and is commonly used in the United States, when measuring tensile strengths.

===Ductile materials===
Many materials can display linear elastic behavior, defined by a linear stress–strain relationship, as shown in figure 1 up to point 3. The elastic behavior of materials often extends into a non-linear region, represented in figure 1 by point 2 (the &quot;yield strength&quot;), up to which deformations are completely recoverable upon removal of the load; that is, a specimen loaded elastically in tension will elongate, but will return to its original shape and size when unloaded. Beyond this elastic region, for ductile materials, such as steel, deformations are plastic. A plastically deformed specimen does not completely return to its original size and shape when unloaded. For many applications, plastic deformation is unacceptable, and is used as the design limitation.

After the yield point, ductile metals undergo a period of strain hardening, in which the stress increases again with increasing strain, and they begin to neck, as the cross-sectional area of the specimen decreases due to plastic flow. In a sufficiently ductile material, when necking becomes substantial, it causes a reversal of the engineering stress–strain curve (curve A, figure 2); this is because the &quot;engineering stress&quot; is calculated assuming the original cross-sectional area before necking. The reversal point is the maximum stress on the engineering stress–strain curve, and the engineering stress coordinate of this point is the ultimate tensile strength, given by point 1.

Ultimate tensile strength is not used in the design of ductile static members because design practices dictate the use of the yield stress. It is, however, used for quality control, because of the ease of testing. It is also used to roughly determine material types for unknown samples.

The ultimate tensile strength is a common engineering parameter to design members made of brittle material because such materials have no yield point.

==Testing==
Typically, the testing involves taking a small sample with a fixed cross-sectional area, and then pulling it with a tensometer at a constant strain (change in gauge length divided by initial gauge length) rate until the sample breaks.

When testing some metals, indentation hardness correlates linearly with tensile strength. This important relation permits economically important nondestructive testing of bulk metal deliveries with lightweight, even portable equipment, such as hand-held Rockwell hardness testers. This practical correlation helps quality assurance in metalworking industries to extend well beyond the laboratory and universal testing machines.

==Typical tensile strengths==
:Many of the values depend on manufacturing process and purity or composition.
:Multiwalled carbon nanotubes have the highest tensile strength of any material yet measured, with one measurement of 63 GPa, still well below one theoretical value of 300 GPa. The first nanotube ropes (20 mm in length) whose tensile strength was published (in 2000) had a strength of 3.6 GPa. The density depends on the manufacturing method, and the lowest value is 0.037 or 0.55 (solid).
:The strength of spider silk is highly variable. It depends on many factors including kind of silk (Every spider can produce several for sundry purposes.), species, age of silk, temperature, humidity, swiftness at which stress is applied during testing, length stress is applied, and way the silk is gathered (forced silking or natural spinning). The value shown in the table, 1,000 MPa, is roughly representative of the results from a few studies involving several different species of spider however specific results varied greatly.
:Human hair strength varies by genetics, environmental factors, and chemical treatments.

<text>A hexahedron (: hexahedra or hexahedrons) or sexahedron (: sexahedra or sexahedrons) is any polyhedron with six faces. A cube, for example, is a regular hexahedron with all its faces square, and three squares around each vertex.

There are seven topologically distinct &quot;convex&quot; hexahedra, one of which exists in two mirror image forms. Additional non-convex hexahedra exist, with their number depending on how polyhedra are defined. Two polyhedra are &quot;topologically distinct&quot; if they have intrinsically different arrangements of faces and vertices, such that it is impossible to distort one into the other simply by changing the lengths of edges or the angles between edges or faces.

==Convex==
===Cuboid===
A hexahedron that is combinatorially equivalent to a cube may be called a cuboid, although this term is often used more specifically to mean a rectangular cuboid, a hexahedron with six rectangular sides. Different types of cuboids include the ones depicted and linked below.

===Others===
There are seven topologically distinct convex hexahedra, the cuboid and six others, which are depicted below. One of these is chiral, in the sense that it cannot be deformed into its mirror image.

==Concave==
Three further topologically distinct hexahedra can only be realised as &quot;concave&quot; acoptic polyhedra. These are defined as the surfaces formed by non-crossing simple polygon faces, with each edge shared by exactly two faces and each vertex surrounded by a cycle of three or more faces.
These cannot be convex because they do not meet the conditions of Steinitz&#x27;s theorem, which states that convex polyhedra have vertices and edges that form 3-vertex-connected graphs.
For other types of polyhedra that allow faces that are not simple polygons, such as the &quot;spherical polyhedra&quot; of Hong and Nagamochi, more possibilities exist.

<doc id="237213" wikidata="Q1139111" url="?curid=237213" title="Quotient space (topology)">
<text>In topology and related areas of mathematics, the quotient space of a topological space under a given equivalence relation is a new topological space constructed by endowing the quotient set of the original topological space with the quotient topology, that is, with the finest topology that makes continuous the canonical projection map (the function that maps points to their equivalence classes). In other words, a subset of a quotient space is open if and only if its preimage under the canonical projection map is open in the original topological space.

Intuitively speaking, the points of each equivalence class are or &quot;glued together&quot; for forming a new topological space. For example, identifying the points of a sphere that belong to the same diameter produces the projective plane as a quotient space.

==Definition==

Let formula_1 be a topological space, and let formula_2 be an equivalence relation on formula_3 The quotient set formula_4 is the set of equivalence classes of elements of formula_3 The equivalence class of formula_6 is denoted formula_7 

The construction of formula_8 defines a canonical surjection formula_9 As discussed below, formula_10 is a quotient mapping, commonly called the canonical quotient map, or canonical projection map, associated to formula_11

The quotient space under formula_2 is the set formula_8 equipped with the quotient topology, whose open sets are those subsets formula_14 whose preimage formula_15 is open. In other words, formula_16 is open in the quotient topology on formula_17 if and only if is open in formula_3 Similarly, a subset formula_19 is closed if and only if formula_20 is closed in formula_3

The quotient topology is the final topology on the quotient set, with respect to the map formula_22

==Quotient map==

A map formula_23 is a quotient map (sometimes called an identification map) if it is surjective and formula_8 is equipped with the final topology induced by formula_25 The latter condition admits two more-elementary formulations: a subset formula_26 is open (closed) if and only if formula_27 is open (resp. closed). Every quotient map is continuous but not every continuous map is a quotient map. 

Saturated sets

A subset formula_28 of formula_1 is called saturated (with respect to formula_30) if it is of the form formula_31 for some set formula_32 which is true if and only if formula_33
The assignment formula_34 establishes a one-to-one correspondence (whose inverse is formula_35) between subsets formula_36 of formula_37 and saturated subsets of formula_3 
With this terminology, a surjection formula_23 is a quotient map if and only if for every subset formula_28 of formula_41 formula_28 is open in formula_1 if and only if formula_44 is open in formula_45 
In particular, open subsets of formula_1 that are saturated have no impact on whether the function formula_30 is a quotient map (or, indeed, continuous: a function formula_23 is continuous if and only if, for every saturated formula_49 such that formula_44 is open in the set formula_28 is open in 

Indeed, if formula_52 is a topology on formula_1 and formula_23 is any map, then the set formula_55 of all formula_56 that are saturated subsets of formula_1 forms a topology on formula_3 If formula_8 is also a topological space then formula_60 is a quotient map (respectively, continuous) if and only if the same is true of formula_61

Quotient space of fibers characterization

Given an equivalence relation formula_62 on formula_41 denote the equivalence class of a point formula_6 by formula_65 and let formula_66 denote the set of equivalence classes. The map formula_67 that sends points to their equivalence classes (that is, it is defined by formula_68 for every formula_6) is called . It is a surjective map and for all formula_70 formula_71 if and only if formula_72 consequently, formula_73 for all formula_74 In particular, this shows that the set of equivalence class formula_75 is exactly the set of fibers of the canonical map formula_76
If formula_1 is a topological space then giving formula_75 the quotient topology induced by formula_10 will make it into a quotient space and make formula_67 into a quotient map. 
Up to a homeomorphism, this construction is representative of all quotient spaces; the precise meaning of this is now explained. 

Let formula_23 be a surjection between topological spaces (not yet assumed to be continuous or a quotient map) and declare for all formula_82 that formula_71 if and only if formula_84 Then formula_62 is an equivalence relation on formula_1 such that for every formula_87 formula_88 which implies that formula_89 (defined by formula_90) is a singleton set; denote the unique element in formula_89 by formula_92 (so by definition, formula_93). 
The assignment formula_94 defines a bijection formula_95 between the fibers of formula_30 and points in formula_45 
Define the map formula_98 as above (by formula_68) and give formula_17 the quotient topology induced by formula_10 (which makes formula_10 a quotient map). These maps are related by: formula_103 
From this and the fact that formula_98 is a quotient map, it follows that formula_23 is continuous if and only if this is true of formula_106 Furthermore, formula_23 is a quotient map if and only if formula_108 is a homeomorphism (or equivalently, if and only if both formula_109 and its inverse are continuous). 

===Related definitions===

A is a surjective map formula_23 with the property that for every subset formula_111 the restriction formula_112 is also a quotient map. 
There exist quotient maps that are not hereditarily quotient.

==Examples==

* Gluing. Topologists talk of gluing points together. If formula_1 is a topological space, gluing the points formula_114 and formula_115 in formula_1 means considering the quotient space obtained from the equivalence relation formula_117 if and only if formula_118 or formula_119 (or formula_120).
* Consider the unit square formula_121 and the equivalence relation ~ generated by the requirement that all boundary points be equivalent, thus identifying all boundary points to a single equivalence class. Then formula_122 is homeomorphic to the sphere formula_123

*Adjunction space. More generally, suppose formula_1 is a space and formula_125 is a subspace of formula_3 One can identify all points in formula_125 to a single equivalence class and leave points outside of formula_125 equivalent only to themselves. The resulting quotient space is denoted formula_129 The 2-sphere is then homeomorphic to a closed disc with its boundary identified to a single point: formula_130
* Consider the set formula_131 of real numbers with the ordinary topology, and write formula_132 if and only if formula_133 is an integer. Then the quotient space formula_17 is homeomorphic to the unit circle formula_135 via the homeomorphism which sends the equivalence class of formula_114 to formula_137
* A generalization of the previous example is the following: Suppose a topological group formula_138 acts continuously on a space formula_3 One can form an equivalence relation on formula_1 by saying points are equivalent if and only if they lie in the same orbit. The quotient space under this relation is called the orbit space, denoted formula_141 In the previous example formula_142 acts on formula_131 by translation. The orbit space formula_144 is homeomorphic to formula_145
**&quot;Note&quot;: The notation formula_144 is somewhat ambiguous. If formula_147 is understood to be a group acting on formula_131 via addition, then the quotient is the circle. However, if formula_147 is thought of as a topological subspace of formula_131 (that is identified as a single point) then the quotient formula_151 (which is identifiable with the set formula_152) is a countably infinite bouquet of circles joined at a single point formula_153
* This next example shows that it is in general true that if formula_154 is a quotient map then every convergent sequence (respectively, every convergent net) in formula_8 has a lift (by formula_10) to a convergent sequence (or convergent net) in formula_3 Let formula_158 and formula_159 Let formula_160 and let formula_161 be the quotient map formula_162 so that formula_163 and formula_164 for every formula_165 The map formula_166 defined by formula_167 is well-defined (because formula_168) and a homeomorphism. Let formula_169 and let formula_170 be any sequences (or more generally, any nets) valued in formula_171 such that formula_172 in formula_173 Then the sequence formula_174 converges to formula_175 in formula_176 but there does not exist any convergent lift of this sequence by the quotient map formula_10 (that is, there is no sequence formula_178 in formula_1 that both converges to some formula_6 and satisfies formula_181 for every formula_182). This counterexample can be generalized to nets by letting formula_183 be any directed set, and making formula_184 into a net by declaring that for any formula_185 formula_186 holds if and only if both (1) formula_187 and (2) if formula_188 then the formula_125-indexed net defined by letting formula_190 equal formula_191 and equal to formula_192 has no lift (by formula_10) to a convergent formula_125-indexed net in formula_173

==Properties==

Quotient maps formula_154 are characterized among surjective maps by the following property: if formula_197 is any topological space and formula_198 is any function, then formula_30 is continuous if and only if formula_200 is continuous.

The quotient space formula_75 together with the quotient map formula_67 is characterized by the following universal property: if formula_203 is a continuous map such that formula_117 implies formula_205 for all formula_70 then there exists a unique continuous map formula_207 such that formula_208 In other words, the following diagram commutes:

One says that formula_209 &quot;descends to the quotient&quot; for expressing this, that is that it factorizes through the quotient space. The continuous maps defined on formula_75 are, therefore, precisely those maps which arise from continuous maps defined on formula_1 that respect the equivalence relation (in the sense that they send equivalent elements to the same image). This criterion is copiously used when studying quotient spaces.

Given a continuous surjection formula_154 it is useful to have criteria by which one can determine if formula_10 is a quotient map. Two sufficient criteria are that formula_10 be open or closed. Note that these conditions are only sufficient, not necessary. It is easy to construct examples of quotient maps that are neither open nor closed. For topological groups, the quotient map is open.

==Compatibility with other topological notions==

Separation

* In general, quotient spaces are ill-behaved with respect to separation axioms. The separation properties of formula_1 need not be inherited by formula_176 and formula_176 may have separation properties not shared by formula_3
* formula_17 is a T1 space if and only if every equivalence class of formula_62 is closed in formula_3
* If the quotient map is open, then formula_176 is a Hausdorff space if and only if ~ is a closed subset of the product space formula_223

Connectedness

* If a space is connected or path connected, then so are all its quotient spaces.
* A quotient space of a simply connected or contractible space need not share those properties.

Compactness

* If a space is compact, then so are all its quotient spaces.
* A quotient space of a locally compact space need not be locally compact.

Dimension

* The topological dimension of a quotient space can be more (as well as less) than the dimension of the original space; space-filling curves provide such examples.

<doc id="237214" wikidata="Q735604" url="?curid=237214" title="AspectJ">
<text>AspectJ is an aspect-oriented programming (AOP) extension for the Java programming language, created at PARC. It is available in Eclipse Foundation open-source projects, both stand-alone and integrated into Eclipse. AspectJ has become a widely used de facto standard for AOP by emphasizing simplicity and usability for end users. It uses Java-like syntax, and included IDE integrations for displaying crosscutting structure since its initial public release in 2001.

==Simple language description==
All valid Java programs are also valid AspectJ programs, but AspectJ lets programmers define special constructs called &quot;aspects&quot;. Aspects can contain several entities unavailable to standard classes. These are:

;Extension methods: Allow a programmer to add methods, fields, or interfaces to existing classes from within the aspect. This example adds an codice_1 (see visitor pattern) method to the codice_2 class:
aspect VisitAspect {
 void Point.acceptVisitor(Visitor v) {
 v.visit(this);
}
;Pointcuts: Allow a programmer to specify join points (well-defined moments in the execution of a program, like method call, object instantiation, or variable access). All pointcuts are expressions (quantifications) that determine whether a given join point matches. For example, this point-cut matches the execution of any instance method in an object of type codice_2 whose name begins with codice_4:
pointcut set() : execution(* set*(..) ) &amp;&amp; this(Point);
;Advices: Allow a programmer to specify code to run at a join point matched by a pointcut. The actions can be performed &quot;before&quot;, &quot;after&quot;, or &quot;around&quot; the specified join point. Here, the advice refreshes the display every time something on codice_2 is set, using the pointcut declared above:
after () : set() {
 Display.update();


AspectJ also supports limited forms of pointcut-based static checking and aspect reuse (by inheritance). See the AspectJ Programming Guide for a more detailed description of the language.

==AspectJ compatibility and implementations==
AspectJ can be implemented in many ways, including source-weaving or bytecode-weaving, and directly in the virtual machine (VM). In all cases, the AspectJ program becomes a valid Java program that runs in a Java VM. Classes affected by aspects are binary-compatible with unaffected classes (to remain compatible with classes compiled with the unaffected originals). Supporting multiple implementations allows the language to grow as technology changes, and being Java-compatible ensures platform availability.

Key to its success has been engineering and language decisions that make the language usable and programs deployable. The original Xerox AspectJ implementation used source weaving, which required access to source code. When Xerox contributed the code to Eclipse, AspectJ was reimplemented using the Eclipse Java compiler and a bytecode weaver based on BCEL, so developers could write aspects for code in binary (.class) form. At this time the AspectJ language was restricted to support a per-class model essential for incremental compilation and load-time weaving. This made IDE integrations as responsive as their Java counterparts, and it let developers deploy aspects without altering the build process. This led to increased adoption, as AspectJ became usable for impatient Java programmers and enterprise-level deployments. Since then, the Eclipse team has increased performance and correctness, upgraded the AspectJ language to support Java 5 language features like generics and annotations, and integrated annotation-style pure-java aspects from AspectWerkz.

The Eclipse project supports both command-line and Ant interfaces. A related Eclipse project has steadily improved the Eclipse IDE support for AspectJ (called &quot;AspectJ Development Tools (AJDT)&quot;) and other providers of crosscutting structure. IDE support for emacs, NetBeans, and JBuilder foundered when Xerox put them into open source, but support for Oracle&#x27;s JDeveloper did appear. IDE support has been key to Java programmers using AspectJ and understanding crosscutting concerns.

BEA has offered limited VM support for aspect-oriented extensions, but for extensions supported in all Java VM&#x27;s would require agreement through Sun&#x27;s Java Community Process (see also the java.lang.instrument package available since Java SE 5 — which is a common ground for JVM load-time instrumentation).

Academic interest in the semantics and implementation of aspect-oriented languages has surrounded AspectJ since its release. The leading research implementation of AspectJ is the AspectBench Compiler, or &quot;abc&quot;; it supports extensions for changing the syntax and semantics of the language and forms the basis for many AOP experiments that the AspectJ team can no longer support, given its broad user base.

Many programmers discover AspectJ as an enabling technology for other projects, most notably Spring AOP. A sister Spring project, Spring Roo, automatically maintains AspectJ inter-type declarations as its principal code generation output.

==History and contributors==
Gregor Kiczales started and led the Xerox PARC team that eventually developed AspectJ. He coined the term &quot;crosscutting&quot;. Fourth on the team, Chris Maeda coined the term &quot;aspect-oriented programming.&quot; Jim Hugunin and Erik Hilsdale (Xerox PARC team members 12 and 13) were the original compiler and weaver engineers, Mik Kersten implemented the IDE integration and started the Eclipse AJDT project with Adrian Colyer and Andrew Clement. After Adrian Colyer, Andrew Clement took over as project lead and main contributor for AspectJ. AJDT has since been retired as a separate project and taken over into the Eclipse AspectJ umbrella project to streamline maintenance. However, both AspectJ and AJDT are still maintained in separate source repositories.

In 2021, Alexander Kriegisch joined the project, first as a contributor, then as a committer and maintainer. Since March 2021, he is basically the sole maintainer. Since 2024, he also is formally the AspectJ and AJDT project lead.

The AspectBench Compiler was developed and is maintained as a joint effort of the Programming Tools Group at the Oxford University Computing Laboratory, the Sable Research Group at McGill University, and the Institute for Basic Research in Computer Science (BRICS).

===AspectWerkz===
AspectWerkz was a dynamic, lightweight and high-performance AOP/AOSD framework for Java. It has been merged with the AspectJ project, which supports AspectWerkz functionality since AspectJ 5.

Jonas Boner and Alex Vasseur engineered the AspectWerkz project, and later contributed to the AspectJ project when it merged in the AspectWerkz annotation style and load-time weaving support.

Unlike AspectJ prior to version 5, AspectWerkz did not add any new language constructs to Java, but instead supported declaration of aspects within Java annotations. It utilizes bytecode modification to weave classes at project build-time, class load time, as well as runtime. It uses standardized . Aspects can be defined using either Java annotations (introduced with Java 5), Java 1.3/1.4 custom doclet or a simple XML definition file.

AspectWerkz provides an API to use the very same aspects for proxies, hence providing a transparent experience, allowing a smooth transition for users familiar with proxies.

AspectWerkz is free software. The LGPL-style license allows the use of AspectWerkz 2.0 in both commercial and open source projects.

<doc id="237221" wikidata="Q22706" url="?curid=237221" title="Vehicle registration plate">
<text>A vehicle registration plate, also known as a number plate (British, Indian and Australian English), license plate (American English) or licence plate (Canadian English), is a metal or plastic plate attached to a motor vehicle or trailer for official identification purposes. All countries require registration plates for commercial road vehicles such as cars, trucks, and motorcycles, for hire. Whether they are required for other vehicles, such as bicycles, boats, or tractors, may vary by jurisdiction. The registration identifier is a numeric or alphanumeric ID that uniquely identifies the vehicle or vehicle owner within the issuing region&#x27;s vehicle register. In some countries, the identifier is unique within the entire country, while in others it is unique within a state or province. Whether the identifier is associated with a vehicle or a person also varies by issuing agency. There are also electronic license plates.

== Legal requirements ==

In Europe, most governments require a registration plate to be attached to both the front and rear of a vehicle, although certain jurisdictions or vehicle types, such as motorcycles, require only one plate, which is usually attached to the rear of the vehicle. Special vehicles, such as agricultural and construction equipment, might have the license plate attached to other parts of the vehicle. National databases relate this number to other information describing the vehicle, such as the make, model, colour, year of manufacture, engine size, type of fuel used, mileage recorded (and other similar data in jurisdictions where vehicles are regularly inspected for roadworthiness every year or two), vehicle identification number (chassis number), and the name and address of the vehicle&#x27;s registered owner or keeper.

In the vast majority of jurisdictions, the government holds a monopoly on the manufacturing of vehicle registration plates for that jurisdiction. Either a government agency or a private company with express contractual authorization from the government makes plates as needed, which are then mailed to, delivered to, or picked up by the vehicle owners. Thus, it is normally illegal for private citizens to make and affix their own plates, because such unauthorized private manufacturing is equivalent to forging an official document. Alternatively, the government will merely assign plate numbers, and it is the vehicle owner&#x27;s responsibility to find an approved private supplier to make a plate with that number. Additionally, citizens can create custom plates, following specific guidelines and naming conventions approved by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA).

In some jurisdictions, plates will be permanently assigned to that particular vehicle for its lifetime. If the vehicle is either destroyed or exported to a different jurisdiction, the plate number is retired or reissued; exported vehicles must be re-registered in the jurisdiction of import. China requires the re-registration of any vehicle that crosses its borders from another country, such as for overland tourist visits, regardless of the length of time it is due to remain there; this has to be arranged with prior approval. Other jurisdictions follow a &quot;plate-to-owner&quot; policy, meaning that when a vehicle is sold the seller removes the current plate(s) from the vehicle. Buyers must either obtain new plates or attach plates they already hold, as well as register their vehicles under the buyer&#x27;s name and plate number. A person who sells a car and then purchases a new one can apply to have the old plates put onto the new car. One who sells a car and does not buy a new one may, depending on the local laws involved, have to turn the old plates in or destroy them, or may be permitted to keep them. Some jurisdictions permit the registration of the vehicle with &quot;personal&quot; (&quot;vanity&quot; or &quot;cherished mark&quot;) plates.

In some jurisdictions, plates require periodic replacement, often associated with a design change of the plate itself. Vehicle owners may or may not have the option to keep their original plate number, and may have to pay a fee to exercise this option. Alternately, or additionally, vehicle owners have to replace a small decal on the plate or use a decal on the windshield to indicate the expiration date of the vehicle registration, periodic safety and/or emissions inspections or vehicle taxation. Other jurisdictions have replaced the decal requirement through the use of computerization: a central database maintains records of which plate numbers are associated with expired registrations, communicating with automated number plate readers to enable law-enforcement to identify expired registrations in the field.

=== Placement ===
Plates are usually fixed directly to a vehicle or to a plate frame that is fixed to the vehicle. Sometimes, the plate frames contain advertisements inserted by the vehicle service centre or the dealership from which the vehicle was purchased. Vehicle owners can also purchase customized frames to replace the original frames. In some jurisdictions registration plate frames are illegal or have design restrictions. For example, many states, like Texas, allow plate frames but prohibit plate frames from covering the name of the state, province, district, Native American tribe or country that issued the license plate (when that information appears on the plate). Plates are designed to conform to standards with regard to being read by eye in day or at night, or by electronic equipment. Some drivers purchase clear, smoke-colored or tinted covers that go over the registration plate to prevent electronic equipment from scanning the registration plate. Legality of these covers varies. Some cameras incorporate filter systems that make such avoidance attempts unworkable, usually with infra-red filters.

Vehicles pulling trailers, such as caravans and semi-trailer trucks, are typically required to display a third registration plate on the rear of the trailer.

== Plate design considerations ==
An engineering study by the University of Illinois published in 1960 recommended that the state of Illinois adopt a numbering system and plate design &quot;composed of combinations of characters which can be perceived quickly and accurately, are legible at a distance of approximately under daylight conditions, and are readily adapted to filing and administrative procedures&quot;. It also recommended that a standard plate size of by be adopted through the United States to replace the earlier by size to allow longer registration numbers to be displayed without excessively tight spacing or excessively thin or narrow characters.

In order to combat registration plate fraud, from the 1920s several jurisdictions developed their own anti-fraud typefaces so that characters cannot be painted or modified to resemble other characters. Since the 1990s, many jurisdictions have adopted the FE-Schrift typeface.

English uses twenty-six letters (languages such as German, Icelandic and Danish have more letters), so assuming that the letters vs. digits must appear in particular locations (common on plates in most jurisdictions, for instance four decimal digits and two letters where the letters must come first, allowing AB1234 but excluding A12B34), allowing for repeating letters and digits, the combinations for each of these will be:

If letters and digits can appear in any order, it is problematic to allow both the letter O and the digit 0 to be used. Even if the license plate uses distinguishable characters for the two, someone transcribing the plate may not know which symbol has which meaning, and the owner of plate EM6F9VO may get in trouble for something the owner of plate EM6F9V0 did. Other letter–digit pairs, like I and 1, may be similarly problematic to a lesser degree. Allowing for repeating letters and digits, the combinations for each of these will be:

== History ==
France was the first country to introduce the registration plate with the enactment of the Paris Police Ordinance on 14 August 1893, followed by Germany in 1896. The Netherlands was the first country to introduce a national registration plate, called a &quot;driving permit&quot;, in 1898. Initially these plates were just sequentially numbered, starting at 1, but this was changed in 1906.

In the United States, where each state issues plates, New York State has required plates since 1903 (black numerals on a white background) after first requiring in 1901 only that the owner&#x27;s initials be clearly visible on the back of the vehicle. At first, plates were not government-issued in most jurisdictions and motorists were obliged to make their own. In 1903, Massachusetts was the first state to issue plates. In 1928, Idaho was the first state to put a logo on the plate (the &quot;Idaho Potato&quot;).

In Spain, the first law to define rules on non-animal vehicle traction was and the registration of vehicles was defined as a provincial task in the .

The first Spanish registration plate, PM–1, was issued for a Clément-Talbot on 31 October 1900 in Palma de Mallorca. 256 vehicles were registered between 1901 and 1905.

=== Materials ===
The earliest plates were made of enamel on metal or ceramic with no backing, which made them fragile and impractical. Few of these early plates survived. Later experimental materials include cardboard, leather, plastic, and, during wartime shortages, copper and pressed soybeans.

As of the 21st century, most plates are made out of aluminium. Metal plates are manufactured through one of two processes: embossing or riveting. For embossing, a plate is placed between dies on each side corresponding to the desired characters and compressed by a press. For riveting, holes are drilled through the plate and then individual letters are riveted one-by-one to the plate.

New technology has allowed for the development of digital license plates. In 2018, Michigan approved Public Act 656, making electronic license plates legal.

=== Sizes ===
Early 20th century plates varied in size and shape from one jurisdiction to the next, such that if someone moved or the car was resold in a new area, new holes would need to be drilled into the automobile (often on the bumper) to support the new plate, or an adapter plate be made. Standardization of plates came in 1957, when automobile manufacturers came to agreement with governments and international standards organizations. While peculiar local variants exist, there are four basic standards worldwide:
* or – in the bulk of European countries and many of their former overseas territories, as well as North Korea and South Korea.
* – in the Mercosur member countries: Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay, originally based on the 1990 Brazilian standard.
* – in the majority of North America and Central America, and parts of South America; occasionally in Switzerland and Liechtenstein; and many Persian Gulf countries, also allowed for imported vehicles in the United Kingdom.
* – in Australia and some other Pacific Rim countries, about halfway between the dimensions of the other two standards, longer than Western Hemisphere plates but taller than European ones.

Additional sizes include:
* – two line pattern, optional in several European countries for 4×4 and imported vehicles;
* – in Russia for imported Japanese and American vehicles.
* – in Switzerland and Liechtenstein.
* – in Saudi Arabia.
* – in Iraq.
* – in Andorra.
* In Vietnam:
** from to – for car,
** – for bike.
* – in Japan.
* In Monaco:
** – for the rear,
** – for the front.
* – in Thailand.
* – in Italy (front plates), and Oman.
* – in New Zealand.
* – in Chile.
* – in Taiwan.
* – in San Marino.
* – in the Philippines
* – in Ecuador.
* – in Jordan.
* In Indonesia
** – for two and three wheeled vehicles, in the front and rear.
** – for four-wheeled vehicles and more, in the front and rear.
* – in South Africa and Finland.
* – in China, but for New Energy vehicles.
* – in Syria and Tunisia.

Previous sizes included:
* – in Vietnam before 2021 for all vehicles.
* – in Paraguay and Taiwan; Paraguay now uses Mercosur size plates.
* – in South Korea, now uses European size plates.
* – in Belgium before 2013.
* – in Luxembourg before 2003.
* – in Uruguay before 2016.
* – in Finland before 2001.
* – in Serbia before 2011, based on Yugoslavia&#x27;s standard.

== Africa ==

=== Algeria ===

Algerian registration plates are manufactured according to the same standards as their French counterparts (prior to 2009), using the same font and dimensions – although there has been a recent tendency to apply custom typefaces (impact and century gothic have been observed).

=== Botswana ===

Normal vehicles have number plates starting with the letter &quot;B&quot;, followed by three digits, followed by three letters. The digits and letters are assigned by a registrar. The three letters never include the letter &quot;Q&quot;, to avoid confusion with &quot;O&quot;. Botswana number plates have a reflective white front and yellow rear background, and black lettering.

Government vehicles all have the prefix &quot;BX&quot;, these number plates have a white reflective background with red lettering at the front and white on red at the rear. After &#x27;BX&#x27; are the last two numerals of the date of issue and then up to four digits issued serially.

Botswana Defence Force vehicles have the prefix &quot;BDF&quot; in white on an &#x27;army&#x27; green background.

Diplomatic vehicles&#x27; number plates start with two numerals which indicate the embassy to which they are attached, then two letters CD (Corps Diplomatique), CC (Consular Corps status) or CT (Foreign Technical and Advisory personnel) and another three digits which are serial. The official car of the Head of Mission uses the letters CMD rather than CD and the private vehicle uses CDA.
This series is allocated by the Minister of Foreign Affairs.

Botswana is the former British Protectorate of Bechuanaland, and number plates then used a &#x27;BP&#x27; prefix (then BPA, BPB, etc.) followed by up to three digits, in white on black background, the plates being made in the characteristic style of South Africa at that time.

=== Burkina Faso ===

Vehicles are fitted with registration plates in the front and rear of the vehicle. Motorcycles (50cc or more) must be licensed and only bear rear plates. Registration is performed at the local police or Gendarmerie station. The first digits of the plate indicate the province in which the vehicle is registered. Only plates which meet government standards and are sold by licensed dealers may be fitted.

Private passenger car registration plates have a white background with black letters and digits. Plates exist in a long pattern and a rectangular pattern, similar in size and appearance to French plates. The plate is adorned with a small flag of Burkina Faso in the shape of the country, inscribed in a black circle. The letters &quot;BF&quot; appear below the circle, also in black. This circle and BF design is to the right of the long plate and to the upper right of the rectangular plate. Motorcycle plates are similar to rectangular automobile plates, but smaller.

Commercial registration plates are similar in appearance to private plates, but the background is blue, and the writing and circle are white.

Security forces plates are black with white letters. They are adorned with the emblem of the relevant security service.

=== Cameroon ===


The current scheme of regular license plates was introduced in 1985. It has AB1234V formats or AB123VH where AB is the code region, 1234 is the number, and SH is the series. The regular plate has an orange background with black marks. Since 2005, to reflect the German FE font used, on the left side of the plate are the emblems of the Economic Community of Central African States code and the CMR emblem.

=== Kenya ===

The current series of vehicle registration plates in Kenya are on a white plate with black lettering and look quite similar to UK suffix style registrations. The format is LLL 000L, where &#x27;L&#x27; denotes a letter and &#x27;0&#x27; denotes a digit. The older series of number plates were black with white or silver lettering. The rear plates in the older series of number plates were yellow and black lettering. According to Kenya National Bureau of Statistics there are over 1,626,380 vehicles on Kenyan roads as at 2011.

=== Morocco ===
New-style (post-1983, black lettering on white) Moroccan vehicle registrations have one or two digits to the right of the plate to indicate the town of registration.
Each number is separated by a vertical line. To the left of the plate are a series of up to 5 digits issued consecutively. These are separated from the town of registration digits by a hyphen.

Earlier plates (1972–1983, black lettering on white. Pre-1972, white lettering on black) differed in that they could have either one or two numbers to indicate the town of registration. The group of digits was separated from the rest of the plate by a vertical line.

The current plates use numerals without script. Earlier plates used numerals and included Arabic script.

=== South Africa ===

South African number plates are unique in each of the provinces. Each province has its own number plate design and colors, as well as numbering scheme.

== Americas ==

=== Argentina ===

The history of registration plates in Argentina can be broken down in two major phases: the decentralized phase (until 1972) and the centralized one (since 1972). During the decentralized phase, registration plates were assigned by each municipality or by the provinces, while during the second phase, the national state took charge of standardizing and centralizing the design and style.

Argentina has used the ABC 123 format since 1995. However, from 2016, new registration plates with the logo of Mercosur and the AB 123 CD format were implemented. Both formats coexist temporarily.

=== Bolivia ===

Bolivia&#x27;s current registration plate system consists of four numbers followed by three letters. At the top of the plate, &quot;BOLIVIA&quot; is spelled out. At the top left corner, the Bolivian flag may be present, and at the top right corner, a letter denoting the department in which the car is registered, according to the ISO 3166-2:BO code, is displayed on either a metal tab on older plates or a sticker on newer plates. The current registration plate design consists of a white background with a blue borderline and blue letters and numbers.

Serial digits progress sequentially from right to left, with the 000 AAA format followed by the 1000AAA format and currently the 4000AAA format.

Older plate serials consisted of three numbers followed by three letters (A to Z, except O and Q). They had a white background with black letters and numbers.

=== Brazil ===

Brazil adopted its former system in 1990, which uses the form ABC•1234, with a dot between the letters and the numbers. A combination given to a particular vehicle follows it from first issue to the scrapyard: it cannot be transferred to another vehicle. Above the combination there was a metallic band with the state abbreviation (SP = São Paulo, RJ = Rio de Janeiro, PR = Paraná, AM = Amazonas, etc.) and the name of the municipality in which the vehicle title owner resides. During the first registration of a new vehicle, the registering state issues a registration plate to the vehicle rather than owner, and the serial stays with the vehicle for its life.

Brazil, as a member of Mercosur, from September 2018 on, began a new registration system where plates have a blue band at the top with the logo of Mercosur on the left, the country&#x27;s name centered and country flag on the right. On the bottom left, there is the international vehicle registration code for Brazil: BR. The plates are always white: the letter coloring indicates the category (e.g., black on white: private; blue on white: official, police, fire departments, etc.; red on white: taxis, buses, paid freight, etc.). A new format based on the previous one, ABC1D23, was implemented. All used cars, when transferred to another owner, must change to the new format keeping their registration, where only its second number (the fifth position of the alphanumeric combination) shall change to a letter, following the pattern: 0=A, 1=B, 2=C, 3=D, ... 9=J. , both formats coexist for the time being.

=== Canada ===


In Canada, license plates are issued on the provincial or territorial level. Federally issued plates are only used by the Department of National Defence. All provinces issue plates in which the letters and numbers are embossed so that they are slightly raised above its surface. The territory of Nunavut introduced the first flat registration plate in Canada in July 2012.

In the Canadian provinces and territories of Alberta, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, the Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia, Nunavut, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Saskatchewan, and the Yukon, registration plates are currently only required on the rear of the vehicle. The remaining provincesBritish Columbia, Manitoba, and Ontariorequire the registration plates to be mounted on both the front and rear of the vehicle, with the exception of some special registration classes in BC such as dealer licenses and &quot;collector floater&quot; plates where only one plate is issued. When a person moves from one province to another, they are normally required to obtain new registration plates issued by the new place of residence, with some agreements between individual provinces allowing temporary workers, and post secondary students to keep their home plates.

In 1956, all North American passenger vehicle registration plates (except for French-controlled St. Pierre and Miquelon), were standardized at a size of , although a smaller size is used for certain vehicle classes, such as motorcycles, and for the state of Delaware&#x27;s historic alternate black and white plates, which are . The plates of the Northwest Territories are shaped like a polar bear but bolt to the standard holes. Nunavut inherited this design on its creation but switched to rectangular plates in 2012. Canadian Forces vehicles that travel on regular roads display registration plates. These vehicles have registration plates issued by the Department of National Defence. Domestic plates were issued by the DND after 1968.

Most Canadian provinces offer personalized or vanity license plates, where one can display their own unique combination of characters.

Prison inmates in Ontario make registration plates.

=== Colombia ===

Private black-on-yellow plates with the ABC·123 format are used in Colombia. The municipality of issuance is embossed at the bottom of the plate.

=== Ecuador ===

Vehicle number plates in Ecuador have only one design, with the word &quot;Ecuador&quot; appearing in uppercase letters centred at the top of the plate and a unique letter-number combination which consists of three letters (except for motorbikes, diplomatic vehicles and vehicles owned by international organisations) followed by three or more numerical digits. Formats in use are ABC-123 (old format) and ABC-1234 (new format).

The first letter in the letter-number combination indicates the province of issue. The second letter might be sequential or a &quot;key letter&quot; identifying the type of registration plate; the following letters and numbers are assigned in sequential order to the date the vehicle has been registered.

=== Greenland ===

Greenlandic vehicle registration plates normally have two letters and five digits. The combination is simply a serial and has no connection with a geographic location, but the digits have a number series based on vehicle type.

=== Mexico ===


Each Mexican state issues registration plates of a different design. Most states change designs more or less every third year, with each state on its own plate replacement cycle. Every year Mexicans pay the or (&quot;car plates renewal tax&quot;). A set of Mexican plates includes one pair of plates, a windshield sticker, and in a few states a plate sticker. In 2001 the size of the plate number was reduced to accommodate the addition of the state number, a legend indicating the position of the plate on the vehicle ( (front) or (rear)), and additional graphics. European-sized plates do exist in Mexico, but are not official or legal. These generally contain the same design as the standard-size plate in use at the time, and bear the standard letter and number sequence.

Mexican plates come in several different classifications: private, private border, public, public border, federal public service, fiscal and customs inspection, Mexico Army, and diplomatic. The border plates were introduced in 1972 and are available in the Mexico–USA border zone. This zone is formed by the states of Baja California and Baja California Sur, as well as parts of Sonora, Chihuahua, Coahuila, and Tamaulipas. While the state of Nuevo León shares a border with the U.S., it does not have any cities within the border zone.

=== Panama ===
In Panama, the design of registration plates changes every year and the plates are the standard North American size and shape. They used to be made by prison inmates but are now produced on demand and on site using a press. Plates used to have 6 numbers, but since 2013 new plates for new vehicles have 2 letters and 4 numbers. The 2 letters go before the numbers. They have a sticker on one of the corners indicating in which month of the year the plate was issued. On the bottom center of the plate is the year when the plate was issued. They also have holograms on the right edge of the plate. On the top center the plate has the word PANAMA. Government vehicles always begin with GO. Taxis begin with T and are always yellow. School buses say COLEGIAL instead of the year the plate was issued. Motorcycles begin with M. Metro buses begin with MB. Plates for motorcycles are about half the standard size. Plates of vehicles belonging to the national assembly are always white and have the logo of the national assembly on the left and two numbers on the right and are always white. Vehicles of government executives have no registration plate. Vehicles from Central America can be used freely in Panama without having to change plates but only if the vehicle will not be staying indefinitely in Panama. Vehicles must be checked every year when changing the plate. The plate must be changed every year and once the vehicle is checked a sticker must be attached to the back of the vehicle&#x27;s windshield. The color of the sticker changes every year.

=== United States ===

The first registration plates in North America appeared in 1903 in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Soon after, other states followed suit, with virtually every state having adopted a form of registration plates by 1918.

The first registration plates in the United States were made out of leather, rubber, iron, and porcelain, painted on the front in usually two different colorsone for the background and one for the lettering. This scheme held true for most states until about 1920. The front of the plate would usually contain the registration number in large digits, and in smaller lettering on one side of the plate, the two- or four-digit year number, and an abbreviated state name. Each year, citizens were usually required to obtain a new registration plate from the state government, which would have a different color scheme than the previous year, making it easier for police to identify whether citizens were current with their vehicle registration.

Even before 1920, some states had adopted the technique of embossing the metal plates with raised lettering and numbering, without porcelain, and applying paint all over the plate, directly onto the metal. Minnesota introduced some registration plates during this period with three different years embossed into the plate, so that the plates were valid for three consecutive years (e.g., 1918, 1919, and 1920).

In the United States, registration plates are issued by each state. The federal government issues plates only for its own vehicle fleet and for vehicles owned by foreign diplomats. In the United States, many Native American tribal governments issue plates for their members, while some states provide special issues for tribal members. Within each jurisdiction, there may also be special plates for groups such as firefighters or military veterans, and for state or municipality-owned vehicles.

The appearance of plates is frequently chosen to contain symbols or slogans associated with the issuing jurisdiction. Some of these are intended to promote the region. A few make political statements; for example, most plates issued in District of Columbia include the phrase &quot;Taxation Without Representation&quot; to highlight D.C.&#x27;s lack of a voting representative in the United States Congress. More recently, some states have also started to put a web address pertaining to the state (such as Pennsylvania, which posts the address of its tourism site). In some states (Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, Ohio, and some versions in Florida), the issuing county is listed at the bottom, while Kansas does so with a letter-coded registration sticker; Utah did so until 2003. Indiana identifies counties with a two-digit code in the lower right corner of its plates. Alabama, Idaho, Montana, Ohio, South Dakota, Wyoming, most Nebraska, and some Oklahoma standard issue plates designate the county by unique codes, usually numeric (Idaho uses a one-letter or one-number/one-letter code; Oklahoma uses a one-letter code), either in the plate number or registration sticker. Some states, such as New Hampshire, New Mexico, and New York, formerly used county-coded or county-labeled plates before switching to standard-progression plates.

Most states use plates onto which the letters and numbers are embossed so that they are slightly raised above its surface. Characters on Vermont plates are engraved onto a large, slightly raised portion of the plate. Seventeen statesAlabama, Arizona, Delaware, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Wyomingand both the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, have moved to entirely digitally printed &quot;flat&quot; registration plates. Several other states, such as Colorado, Mississippi, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Washington, and West Virginia produce a flat registration plate only for certain plates, such as personalized license plates and special interest plates. Nevada reverted from using flat registration plates to using embossed plates, after using flat plates as a standard issue for a few years. Additionally, Wisconsin used flat plates for their endangered resources specialty plates from 2010 to 2016.

The numbering system of registration plates also varies among the jurisdictions. Some states issue a motorist a serial that stays with that person as long as they live in that state, while other states periodically issue new serials and completely rotate out any old ones. Some states issue registration plates to vehicles rather than owners, and the serial stays with the vehicle for its life. Several states do not regularly use certain letters – most commonly the letters I, O, and/or Q – in their plates, except on vanity plates, so as not to confuse observers with the numbers one and zero.

When a person moves from one state to another, they are normally required to obtain new registration plates issued by the new place of residence. Some U.S. states will even require a person to obtain new plates if they accept employment in that state, unless they can show that they return to another state to live on a regular basis. The most prominent exceptions to this policy are active duty military service members, who legally do not change residence when they move to a new posting. Federal law specifically allows them to choose to either retain the state vehicle registration of their original residence or change registration to their state of assignment.

In the United States, 21 states – Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, and West Virginia – do not require an official front registration plate. In Nevada, front plates are optional if the vehicle was not designed for a front plate and the manufacturer did not provide an add-on bracket or other means of displaying the front plate. In Massachusetts, certain old rear-only plates are grandfathered, but newly issued registrations require both front and rear plates. Vehicles owned by the United States Postal Service, unlike other federally owned civilian vehicles, do not bear registration plates, but rather a postal service number such as on the Grumman LLV.

In 1956, all North American passenger vehicle registration plates, except for French-controlled St. Pierre and Miquelon, were standardized at a size of , although a smaller size is used for certain vehicle classes, such as motorcycles, and for the state of Delaware&#x27;s historic alternate black and white plates, which are . However, in 2012 Puerto Rico began issuing optional European-style plates that incorporate the design language of the standard-issue plates in a longer and narrower size typically seen in Europe.

Tactical vehicles of the United States military do not bear registration plates, even if they travel regularly on public streets and highways.

In many U.S. states, registration plates are made by prison inmates. Because of this, colloquial terms include &quot;license plate factories&quot; for prison and &quot;making license plates&quot; for serving a prison sentence.

== Asia ==

=== Afghanistan ===

Afghan registration plates primarily use Persian script text and numerals. The current version was introduced in 2004.

=== Bangladesh ===
Bangladeshi registration plates use Bengali alphabets and Bengali numerals.
In Bangladesh, the Road Transport Authority (BRTA) issues vehicle registration plates for motor vehicles. The vehicle registration plates in Bangladesh use Bengali alphabets and Bengali numerals. The current version of Vehicle registration plates started in 1973. The International vehicle registration code for Bangladesh is BD.

The general format of vehicle registration plates in Bangladesh is &quot;City – Vehicle Class alphabet and No – Vehicle No&quot;. For example, : &quot;DHAKA-D-11-9999&quot;. The &quot;DHAKA&quot; field represents the city name in Bengali alphabets, the &quot;D&quot; field represents the vehicle class in Bengali alphabets, the &quot;11&quot; field represents the vehicle registration serial in Bengali numerals (newer registrations have a higher serial number) and finally, the &quot;9999&quot; field represents the vehicle number of the vehicle in Bengali numerals.

The plates are installed in both the front and rear of the vehicle, with the rear plate permanently attached to the vehicle. The plate is only removed when the vehicle has reached the end of service and has been sold for scrap. New vehicles are not delivered to the purchaser until the plates have been attached at the dealership.

=== China ===
==== Mainland ====

The People&#x27;s Republic of China issues vehicles registration plates at its Vehicle Management Offices, under the administration of the Ministry of Public Security.

The current plates are of the 2007 standard (GA36-2007), blue background and consist a one-character provincial abbreviation, a letter of the Latin alphabet corresponding to a certain city in the province, and five numbers or letters of the alphabet (e.g. 京A-12345, for a vehicle in Beijing or 粤B-12345 for a vehicle from Shenzhen in Guangdong province). The numbers are produced at random, and are computer-generated at the issuing office. (A previous registration plate system, with a green background and the full name of the province in Chinese characters, actually had a sequential numbering order, and the numbering system was eventually beset with corruption).

Yellow plates are issued to motorcycles and large vehicles, such as coaches and buses. Black plates are issued to vehicles belonging to diplomatic missions and foreigners (including Hong Kong and Macau). Vehicles registered in Hong Kong or Macau and permitted to enter China would be required to have a separate black plate from China as Hong Kong and Macau operate their own vehicles registration system. The Chinese plates for these cars followed the pattern of the provincial character for Guangdong (粤), the Latin letter &quot;Z&quot;, 4 letters and/or numbers, ending in the abbreviated character for the territory (e.g. 港 for Hong Kong and 澳 for Macau).

For motorcycles, the front plate only included five numbers and rear contained the full information (e.g. for a motorcycle registered in Shanghai as 沪C•12345, the front plate would be &quot;12345&quot; and the rear plate bears the entire set).

==== Hong Kong ====

Hong Kong number plates follow the British system of colouring, with front white and rear yellow plates. The numbering system is two letters and (up to) four digits, e.g. AB1234. Registration plate numbers starting with &quot;AM&quot; are reserved for government use. The front white and rear yellow background is a reflective material to comply with the BS AU145a standard.

In addition, Hong Kong started a new scheme in 2006 to allow personalised registration plates, with up to eight selectable letters or numbers.

==== Macau ====

Macau local registration plates follow the Portuguese pre-1992 system of colour and sequence. Plates have a black background with white numbers. Numbering system starts from M, and then one letter, and then 4 numbers, and separated by &quot;-&quot;, e.g. MA-12-34. Earlier numbers will only have M instead of MA or MB or MC, etc.

=== Taiwan ===
In the Republic of China (Taiwan), vehicle registration plates are issued by the Ministry of Transportation and Communications. The registration numbers contain Latin letters (A to Z), Arabic numerals (0 to 9) and dash (–), and plates also bear Chinese characters.

=== Vietnam ===
In Vietnam, most license plates, following the 2010 model, consist of a province code, a registration series, and five natural numbers, or the 1976 model with a province code, a registration series, and four natural numbers. Military license plates are a typical exception. According to Circular 24/2023/TT-BCA, license plates are made of metal, have a reflective film, and an embedded police security mark produced by units licensed by the Ministry of Public Security and managed by the Traffic Police Department. Temporary registration license plates are printed on paper. In terms of size, cars are equipped with two license plates, one short plate measuring 330 × 165 mm and one long plate measuring 520 × 110 mm. Tractors, trailers, and semi-trailers are equipped with one license plate at the rear, measuring 330 × 165 mm. Motorcycles are equipped with one license plate at the rear, measuring 190 × 140 mm.

=== India ===

Vehicle registration plates, usually known as number plates, are issued by the Regional Transport Office of each district. Most motor vehicles which are used on public roads are required by law to display them.
The new system which is followed currently in all the states and cities came into effect in the early 1990s. The scheme comprises:
* A two letter identification for the state in which the vehicle is registered.
* A two number code to identify the Regional Transport Office (RTO) where the vehicle is registered.
* An alphabet code to define the series. (one or two Alphabet, depending on vehicle density of the district/RTO)
* A four digit serial.

For Example, in the case of &quot;MH 10 EL 5311&quot;, &quot;MH&quot; stands for Maharashtra, &quot;10&quot; stands for Sangli city RTO, and &quot;EL 5311&quot; denotes the series and serial number.

The Delhi NCR however uses a modified system wherein an additional alphabet is inserted after the RTO code to classify vehicle type. For example, a Delhi registration plate may read &quot;DL 12 C AB 0496&quot; where &quot;DL&quot; stands for Delhi, &quot;12 C&quot; stands for Car, and &quot;AB 0496&quot; is the series and number. In this scheme, &#x27;C&#x27; denotes Car, &#x27;S&#x27; denotes Scooter/Motorcycle, &#x27;R&#x27; stands for rickshaw (three-wheeler), &#x27;F&#x27; stands for &quot;Fancy&quot; or VIP numbers irrespective of vehicle type; and &quot;P&quot; for Public transport vehicles.

Some states have been adapting the dual letter series code system, for example car series&#x27; are CA, CB, CC; motorbike series&#x27; are MA, MB and so on. Most states however still use the standard series code, denoted by a single letter of the alphabet.

=== Indonesia ===
Indonesian vehicle plates share the legacy of the Dutch colonial era, which do not reflect the regional divisions of the country into provinces, but the old system of &quot;karesidenan&quot; or residencies. Their prefixes are therefore based on this system. There are four types of plates that are used in Indonesia, all consisting of a combination of alphabet and numbers.
* For commercial and public vehicles, a yellow background with black typeface.
* For private vehicles, a white background with black typeface (from June 2022). Before that, a black background with white typeface.
* For government vehicles, a red background with white typeface.
* Dealer plates are white background with red typeface, usually for vehicles yet to have legal and confirmed information and owner.

Besides these normal plates, there are also military plates for Army, Navy, Air Force, and also the Police. While diplomatic corps get special white plates and black numbering with &quot;CD&quot; prefix. The normal scheme comprises a one or two letters identification for the regencies, followed by an up to four digit numbers for the car&#x27;s identification, and the last one to three letters are the serial code or district identification. The expiry date of the license is embossed along the bottom and some on the top of the plate. At the middle of the plate number, the numbers are usually random or requested by the vehicle owner and has a maximum of four digits and a maximum of three letters at the end of the vehicle&#x27;s plate number, for example it could be: (B 1 A), (B 12 AB), (B 123 AB), and (B 1234 ABC). Sometimes the last maximum three letters at the end of the plate identifies the district region of the registered vehicle by the first letter, for example: (B 1234 WIE) which &quot;W&quot; identifies the vehicle is from the region of Southern South Tangerang city (Kota Tangerang Selatan), Banten province. Vehicle owners may request their vehicle&#x27;s last letters plate for their own desire, but would need more affairs by the local police registering it, for example that the owner&#x27;s name is &quot;Adi&quot; then he would make his vehicle&#x27;s plate number like so: (B 1234 ADI).

Example:
* B 1234 AB, is mainly a vehicle registered in Jakarta, distinguishable from the letter code from the first letter of the plate, &quot;B&quot; represents the following cities: Jakarta, Depok, Tangerang (includes South Tangerang), and Bekasi. Mainly, vehicles registered in 2008 and later starts using three letters at the end of the whole plate, for example: B 1234 ABC
* L 123 MN, is a vehicle registered in Surabaya, the provincial capital of East Java Surabaya code is &quot;L&quot;
* DB 787 AA, is a vehicle registered in North Sulawesi which includes Minahasa and Manado which is the capital city of the province. North Sulawesi code is &quot;DB&quot;
* KT 8910 T, is a vehicle registered in East Kalimantan Province, Tarakan municipality, on Borneo island. East Kalimantan code is &quot;KT&quot;
* F 8888 LU, is a vehicle registered in Bogor city, West Java. Bogor city code is &quot;F&quot;

The plates usually have their expiration dates shown below or very few on the top of the serial numbers, indicating its expiry month and year, so if it says (12•26) it means that the plate expires at December 2026, so the owner of the vehicle should pay tax and get a new plate at that time, to which the process is redone every five years. A new plate design introduced in April 2011 eliminates a white line circling the whole plate and has a thinner typeface until it was replaced in 2022.

=== Iran ===
Iranian license plates have had European standard dimensions since 2005. Each province in Iran has multiple unique, two-digit codes that are included at the right end of the license plates in a distinguished square outline, above which the word &quot;ایران&quot; or &quot;Iran&quot; has been written. A province&#x27;s license plates will not be issued with a new code unless all possible combinations with the old code have been issued.

In Tehran, the first code to be issued for the province was code 11, and subsequent codes all increased by 11 as well (meaning codes 11, 22, 33, ..., 99 are unique to Tehran.) Ever since code 99 was fully issued, the new codes for Tehran have started from 10 and subsequently increased by 10 (10, 20, 30, ...).


Private vehicles&#x27; plates are black on white with a blue strip on the left. The code in the square represents the regional codes. The letter can be dependent on where the car&#x27;s owner&#x27;s principal address is located. For example, while regional code &quot;83&quot; belongs to Fars Province, letter &quot;م&quot; (M) is dedicated to residents of Larestan County, while letter &quot;هـ&quot; (H) is dedicated to Jahrom County residents.

Iran&#x27;s license plate format is entirely in Persian alphabet. It follows the format ## X ### - NN

* ## ### is the registration code
*X is the series letter. Each unique classification of vehicles is assigned a unique letter. For private vehicles, for example, if numbers start from &quot;11 B 111&quot;, the letter &quot;B&quot; will not change until numbers reach 99 B 999. Then, plates will go up to &quot;11 C111&quot;. These details are explained further in each section of this article.
* NN is the province code.

Example:

* 12 V 345-93, is a vehicle registered in Shiraz. distinguishable from the last two digits of the plate,&quot;93&quot; representing Fars province. And the letter &quot;V&quot; representing Shiraz city.
* 12 Q 345-99, is a vehicle registered in Tehran. distinguishable from the last two digits of the plate, &quot;99&quot; representing Tehran City.

=== Israel ===

Israeli civil registration plates are rectangular with reflecting yellow background and embossed with black registration number. Under the first dash of the registration number (see below form of registration numbers) there is a stamp of approval of the Standards Institute of Israel. On the left side of the plate there is a euroband embossed with the Israeli flag and beneath it the letters IL and ישראל (Israel) written in Hebrew and below it إسرائيل (Israel) written in Arabic. Old plates do not hold this euroband. In North American standard plates (300 x 150mm), the digits are narrower and the blue rectangle is at the bottom of the plate, as the letters are to the right of the flag.

=== Japan ===

Japanese vehicle registration plates fall into two classes: Prefectural, used nationwide, and Municipal. Municipal registration is typically applicable to motor vehicles that will not leave the area, such as light motorcycles.

In the prefectural system, the top line names the office at which the vehicle is registered, and includes a numeric code that indicates the class of vehicle. The bottom contains one serial letter (typically a kana), and up to four digits. The classes of registration plate are divided by vehicle type and engine size. For private vehicles less than, registration plates have black text on a yellow background. Above , a white plate with green text is used. For commercial, non-private vehicles, the colors of the number plate are inverted. An official seal is applied over one (typically the left) screw, preventing the plate being removed and applied to another car.

Municipal registration plates in Japan may vary in color and design.

=== Jordan ===

Jordan requires its residents to register their motor vehicles and display vehicle registration plates.

=== Korea ===

==== North Korea ====
North Korean vehicle plates follow the pattern XX-##-###, where &quot;XX&quot; is replaced with two Hangul syllables spelling the province name.

The most common plates are embossed black-on-white to indicate state ownership; plates indicating KPA use are white-on-black. Motorcycle plates are black-on-yellow or black-on-orange. The very few privately owned motor vehicles which exist in North Korea bear black-on-red plates, while diplomatic plates are white-on-blue. Other types of vehicles (trolleys, emergency vehicles, buses/taxis) are indicated with additional numerical prefixes. Unusually, North Korea requires that bicycles also have license plates, bicycles do not have license plates in most other countries. In a 2024 interview with NK News, the Swedish diplomat August Borg noted the bicycle policy during his time working in North Korea and considered it &quot;unreasonable&quot;.

==== South Korea ====

In South Korea, 6 types of registration number plates (3 variations of size, both non-commercial and commercial) are issued currently. Prior to 2006, sizes of plates were for normal vehicles and for large vehicles (buses with length over and trucks with payload over ). Since November 2006, standard plate size for normal vehicles was changed to , resembling European Union standard. Nonetheless, older plates are still effective for older vehicles and some models not fit for new standard, which are mostly imported cars. One example is the Ford Mustang. Even cars with plate in front and plate in rear are not rare.

Non-commercial vehicles (nationwide registration number &quot;00-X-0000&quot;: X is one Hangeul character denoting type of vehicle) bear plates with white background and black letters, while commercial vehicles (Region name is added as prefix like &quot;Seoul 12 GA 3456&quot;) with yellow background and black letters. In older system, non-commercial vehicles plates had green background and white letters.

There are a few exceptions, including diplomats and United States military.

===Lebanon===

Lebanese vehicle registration plates generally have a blue bar to the left like in European Union countries (except without the 12 golden stars) if the plate is European standard. The blue bar is to the top if the plate is North American standard. The blue bar consists of the name of Lebanon in Arabic (), the Lebanese Cedar tree in the middle, and the vehicle&#x27;s classification all in white. The rest of the plate is white, with a Latin letter representing the vehicle&#x27;s registration area and Arabic numbers next to the letter in bold. Different colors represent different usages (e.g., red ones are used by taxis and public transport, green ones are for rental vehicles, etc.).

=== Malaysia ===

Malaysian registration plates are displayed at the front and rear of all private and commercial motorised vehicles in Malaysia, as required by law. The issuing of the registration plates is regulated and administered by the Malaysian Road Transport Department () or JPJ.

=== Nepal ===

Nepal embossed plate was started from 2017. In Nepal, all road vehicles with or without a motor (except bicycles) are tagged with a registration number. Registration plates are commonly known as number plates. The registration plate number is issued by the zonal-level Transport Management Office, a government agency under the Department of Transport Management. The registration plates must be placed in the front as well as back of the vehicle.

The president of Nepal travels in an official vehicle that has no number on its plates. Instead it has the coat of arms of Nepal embossed on it.

Current system

The current format was introduced on 21 August 2017. This format consists of L LL NNNN where:

L is the category of vehicle,
LL is a &quot;counter&quot; comprising two letters, which increments after the sequence number reaches 9999.
NNNN is a sequence number from 0001 to 9999.
These plates come with a RFID microchip that enables the government to maintain uniformity in issuance of number plates and prevent duplication. Similarly, the new number plates also help authorities to maintain digital records of vehicles plying on the roads, collect revenue on time and control auto theft.

=== Pakistan ===
Eight types of registration plates are used in Pakistan. Each province and territory issues its own number plate; the federal government issues number plates for foreign diplomats and vehicles owned by the military, police and federal departments (red for foreign diplomats and green for the federal government.) Sindh&#x27;s number plates are yellow with black letters and numbers for private vehicles and Black number plates with white letters for commercial vehicles; Islamabad, NWFP, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Balochistan and Northern Areas have white number plates with black letters and numbers. The number plates also have the province or territory&#x27;s name at the bottom. In Punjab however, number plates can be of any color the vehicle owner chooses. But legally it is not allowed. The first 2 letters represent the city the vehicle is registered in.

From January 1, 2006, Punjab has started issuing official number plates for all cars registered in Punjab. Number plates are of Green and White color. The green part is the same all over Punjab and has a sign of plant design that symbolizes fertile land and plains while the white part has the number of the vehicle.

For example:
* RIZ 3725, is a vehicle registered in Rawalpindi, Punjab.
* MN 3909, is a vehicle registered in Multan, Punjab.
* LEL 06 4520, is a vehicle registered in Lahore, Punjab. (&quot;06 represents year 2006&quot;)
All number plates use the Latin alphabet.

=== Philippines ===
=== Saudi Arabia ===

Saudi Arabian vehicle plates display both Arabic and Latin characters.

=== Singapore ===

In general, every motor vehicle in Singapore has a vehicle registration number. Two colour schemes are in use: white-on-black scheme that is standard on cars from dealerships, or the Euro black-on-white (front of the vehicle) and black-on-yellow (rear) scheme, of which the number plate has to be made of a reflective plastic or metallic with textured characters which are black (for white-yellow), or white or silver (for black ones). No standardised typeface is used, though all typefaces are based on the Charles Wright number plate typeface used in the UK. Thinner-looking variants are commonly used by SBS Transit buses, taxis and goods vehicles. Rarely, the FE-Schrift font used in Germany can be seen – though the use of this font is prohibited by the Land Transport Authority (LTA).

A typical vehicle registration number comes in the format &quot;SBA 1234 A&quot;:
* S – Vehicle class (&quot;S&quot;, with some exceptions, stands for a private vehicle since 1984)
* BA – Alphabetical series (&quot;I&quot; and &quot;O&quot; are not used to avoid confusion with &quot;1&quot; and &quot;0&quot;)
* 1234 – Numerical series
* A – Checksum letter (&quot;F&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;, &quot;V&quot; and &quot;W&quot; are never used as checksum letters; absent on special government vehicle plates and events vehicle plates)

=== Sri Lanka ===

Vehicle registration plates of Sri Lanka (known in Sri Lanka as &quot;number plates&quot;) started soon after introduction of motorcars in 1903. Initially the numbers started with Q, and the oldest existing plate is &quot;Q 53&quot; of a 1903 Wolsley. Later the island was divided into sections from &quot;A &quot; to &quot;Z&quot; (Ex A 123 ), then after World War II it changed to the two Roman letter plates combining pairs of letters in the word CEYLON . These series were CL XXXX, EY XXXX, EL XXXx . Afterwards in 1956 a new system with the Sinhala script letter Sri (ශ්‍රී) in the middle was introduced, this started from Reg no &quot;1 Sri 1&quot;.

The current series of car registrations in Sri Lanka was introduced in 2000 and is on yellow number plates with black characters and a black border. On the left hand side of the number plate is the country emblem, below which is a two-letter region identifier e.g. WP represents the Western Province. The format of the remainder of the registration is LL – DDDD, with L being a letter and D being a number. The previous series of registrations had been in effect since 1956 and was on brighter yellow plates with the format DD – DDDD. Also they did not have any national emblem or region identifier. Taxis have white number plates with red lettering.

=== Thailand ===
=== United Arab Emirates ===
=== Vietnam ===


The current Vietnamese registration plate design consists of a white background with black characters, each province has a regional number (located on the left side of the plate).
Official and government cars bear blue registration plates, central government plates bear the number 80 followed by the letter A, B or M, diplomatique plates are white with NG wrote in red, company members vehicles are also white registration plate bearing LD letters in black. Military registration plates are red with white letter.

For example, 51X-XXXX would be used for civilian vehicles, 80X-XXXX with blue background for central government vehicles, 80-XXX-NG-XX for diplomatic vehicles, TC-XX-XX for military vehicles and XXLD-XXX.XX for company vehicles.

== Europe ==

In the European Union (EU), white or yellow number plates of a common format and size are issued throughout, although they are still optional in some member states. Nevertheless, some individual member states still use differing non-EU formats – Belgium, for example, still permits vehicles to display the older small white number plates with red lettering, and the registration plates that are issued by the government body which assigns these are of the smaller format, too. In 1908 number plates were only three digits and one letter long. Italy still permits smaller plates to be attached to the front of a vehicle, while the rear plate complies to the usual EU format. The common design consists of a blue strip on the left of the plate, which has the EU motif (12 yellow stars), along with the country code of the member state in which the vehicle was registered. Lettering on the plate must be black on a white or yellow reflective background. Most plates in Europe bar few exceptions are white, with a notable exception being the Netherlands which issues yellow (the UK also has yellow but only for rear plates, formerly also in France).

According to the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, vehicles in cross-border traffic are obliged to display the international vehicle registration code as a distinguishing sign of the country of registration on the rear of the vehicle. This sign may either be placed separately from the registration plate or may be incorporated into the vehicle registration plate. With registration plates in the common EU format, vehicles registered in the EU are no longer required to carry an international code plate or sticker for traveling within the European Economic Area. The common EU format is also recognized in countries signatory to the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic. As are registration plates of other European countries similar to the EU format, such as Norwegian ones; with the Norwegian flag replacing the circle of stars, or in Turkey&#x27;s case where the blue stripe with the country code is standard but omits the flag over it. Both the common EU format, and e.g. Norwegian registration plates satisfy the requirements laid out in the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic; According to the convention, when the distinguishing sign is incorporated into the registration plate, it must also appear on the front registration plate of the vehicle, and may be supplemented with the flag or emblem of the national state, or the emblem of the regional economic integration organization to which the country belongs.

Diplomatic plates are usually denoted by the letters &quot;CD&quot; in Europe which stands for &quot;Corps Diplomatique&quot; located usually at the beginning of the number plate (France, Belgium, Italy) or middle (Netherlands, Portugal). The United Kingdom uses &quot;D&quot; for &quot;diplomat&quot;.

In order to combat registration plate fraud, Germany developed a typeface which is called &quot;fälschungserschwerende Schrift&quot; (abbr.: &quot;FE-Schrift&quot;), meaning &quot;falsification-hindering script&quot;. It is designed so that, for example, the &quot;O&quot; cannot be adjusted to look like a &quot;Q&quot;, or vice versa; nor can the &quot;P&quot; be painted to resemble an &quot;R&quot;, amongst other changes. This typeface can more easily be read by radar or visual registration plate reading machines, but can be harder to read with the naked eye, especially when the maximum allowed number of eight characters in &quot;Engschrift&quot; (narrower script used when available space is limited) are printed on the plate. Many countries have since adopted &quot;FE-Schrift&quot;, or developed their own anti-fraud typeface.

=== Denmark ===
Denmark offers both a European and a domestic style registration plate. They have a fairly similar look, with the EU strip with the letters DK. Both styles are in the XX 12 345 format.

The first two letters run sequentially with no ties to any geographic region.

The first two digits designate the type of vehicle. For example, 10 through 18 are reserved for motorcycles.

=== Finland ===

EU registration plates were introduced in Finland in 2001. EU plates are automatically given to all vehicles unless the owner makes a separate request for old model plates. If desired, EU plates can be changed for old model ones at inspection sites. Registration plates used in Finland are made of aluminium with a reflective membrane coating. Numbers and letters are embossed and painted. The embossing height is 1–1.2 mm.

The number sequence of the registration plate cannot start with a zero, nor can zero be the only number. The letter combination CD is reserved for diplomatic vehicles. Usually the next available ID is given as the plate number. Special registration plates with a selected ID are also available upon request. A special registration plate is a regular plate with a special ID. The ID is subject to certain restrictions and requires a separate application subject to a fee. The application fee for a special registration plate is EUR 900. A vehicle has one or two plates depending on the vehicle class. In certain cases, a vehicle can also be given an additional plate.

=== Norway ===
The registration numbers of cars in Norway are maintained by the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications. As in most countries, cars are identified only by number plates read visually. The current alphanumerical system (two letters followed by five digits) was introduced in 1971. The design of the plates remained the same until 2002, when the road authorities decided on a new font which standardized the width of each character. The new design was unsuccessful due to legibility issues, for example the letters &quot;A&quot; and &quot;R&quot; were often hard to distinguish. From 2006 the font was changed again to improve legibility, and space was provided for a blue nationality stripe with a Norwegian flag. From 2009, plates were made of plastic, and produced in a factory at Tønsberg. From 2012, plates are again produced in aluminium. Also, electric cars have access to plates that begin with either &quot;EL&quot;, &quot;EK&quot;, &quot;EV&quot;, &quot;EB&quot;, &quot;EC&quot;, &quot;ED&quot;, &quot;EE&quot;, &quot;EF&quot;, or &quot;EH&quot;.

=== Poland ===

Currently used scheme of Polish registration plates was introduced in 2000. There are 9 types in use:
# Standard plates - normal plates, black characters on white background, format XY(Z) ####(#), where X represents voivodeship, Y(Z) county (some counties have one additional letter, while some have two) and ####(#) for a set of letters and digits. (there are currently 11 formats, 2 used for 2-letter counties, 6 for 3-letter counties and 3 for both)
# Motorcycle/moped/agriculture vehicle plate - color scheme identical to standard plates, the only differences are two rows instead of one and using only 4 characters after location code. Format: XY(Z) ####.
# Classic car plates - black text on yellow background and a picture of a vintage car on the right. Format: XY ### or XYZ ##.
# Temporary/export plates - red text on white background, format: X0 #### where 0 stands for a digit.
# Electric car plates - identical to standard plates with the only difference being light green background instead of white.
# Competition car plates - the newest type of registration plates, introduced in 1 June 2024, yellow background and red text, formats are the same as in standard plates.
# Service car plates - plates issued to different kinds of services. (mainly Police and Border Guard, also Central Bureau of Anticorruption, Government Protection Bureau, Internal Security Agency, Foreign Intelligence Agency, Military Counterintelligence Agency and Military Intelligence Agency, in the past also Customs Service and Fiscal Control) Format: H@% #### where @ stands for a letter representing service and % stands for a letter representing certain region.
# Military plates - plates issued for military vehicles, color scheme same as standard plates, format: U@ 00000 or U@ 0000T where @ stands for a type of a vehicle.
# Diplomatic plates - white text on blue background. Poland is one of the few countries not using &quot;CD&quot; to indicate a diplomatic plate. Format: X 000000 where the first three digits indicate country, and the last three - function of the vehicle. 

=== Russia ===

Current Russian registration plates are a mix of French FNI, traditional Arabic &quot;windows&quot;, and Soviet &quot;small characters&quot;, introduced in 1993.

There are six types of Russian registration plates.
# Civil plates – white background with black characters. The character format is &quot;@###@@ | RR&quot;, where @ is a letter, using only the Cyrillic letters &quot;А&quot;, &quot;В&quot;, &quot;Е&quot;, &quot;К&quot;, &quot;М&quot;, &quot;Н&quot;, &quot;О&quot;, &quot;Р&quot;, &quot;С&quot;, &quot;Т&quot;, &quot;У&quot;, &quot;Х&quot; (those that resemble Latin letters), # is a digit and RR is a region number (two or three digits).
# Government plates – white background with black characters. The character format is &quot;@###@@ | FL&quot; where FL is the tricolor flag of Russia (canceled in 2007).
# Police plates – blue background with white characters, format &quot;@#### | RR&quot;.
# Diplomatic plates – red background with white characters, format &quot;###@### | RR&quot;.
# Military plates – black background with white characters, format &quot;####@@ | RR&quot;.
# Route vehicles (buses, trolleys and fixed-run taxies) – yellow background with black characters, format &quot;@@### | RR&quot;.

=== Sweden ===

Vehicle registration plates are white with black characters. The plates have three letters, a space, two digits and lastly one digit or letter. The combination is simply a serial and has no connection with a geographic location. Vehicles like police cars, fire trucks, public buses and trolley buses use the same type of plate as normal private cars, and cannot be directly distinguished by the plate alone. It is possible, for a fee, to get a personal plate with one to seven digits.

Taxis have yellow plates, with the same combination of letters and digits as &#x27;normal&#x27; cars.

The diplomatic corps have blue plates. The two first letters indicate the country or organization of the user.

Military vehicles have four to six yellow digits on black background, and may be used for all kinds of vehicles from ordinary automobiles to tanks.

=== Turkey ===

Turkish car number plates use an indirect numbering system associated with geographical info. In Turkey, registration plates are made by authorized private workshops.
The registration plate is rectangular in shape and made of aluminum. On the left, there is the country code &quot;TR&quot; in a 4×10 cm blue stripe like in EU countries (without the 12 golden stars). The text is in black characters on white background, and for official vehicles white on black. On all vehicles, two plates have to be present, one in front and the other in the rear except for motorcycles and tractors. The serial letters use the letters common to the Turkish and English alphabets, avoiding the Turkish letters Ç, Ğ, İ, Ö, Ş, Ü, and the English letters Q, W, X.

=== Ukraine ===

Ukrainian regular registration plates are issued in European style, using the format AB1234CE (the prefix refers to the region), using Cyrillic letters that resemble Roman letters (&quot;А&quot;, &quot;В&quot;, &quot;Е&quot;, &quot;І&quot;, &quot;К&quot;, &quot;М&quot;, &quot;Н&quot;, &quot;О&quot;, &quot;Р&quot;, &quot;С&quot;, &quot;Т&quot;, &quot;Х&quot;). The plates have, at the far left, the Ukrainian flag and UA (country code) in a 4×10 cm blue stripe like in EU countries (without the 12 golden stars). There were single-line plates for vehicles and trailers, double-line plates for vehicles with special shaped mounting place, three-lined plates for cycles (except scooters with small two-line plates). A plate with a yellow background is used for public-use vehicles such as taxis or route buses. Single-line plates are the standard European size .

Ukrainian vanity plates are unique in that purchasers may choose any image to be printed on the surface of the plate, to the right of the characters.

=== United Kingdom ===
Vehicle registration plates, usually known as number plates, have existed in the United Kingdom since 1904. Most motor vehicles that are used on public roads are required by law to display them. The Motor Car Act 1903, which came into force on 1 January 1904, required all motor vehicles to be entered on an official vehicle register, and to carry number plates. The Act was passed in order that vehicles could be easily traced in the event of an accident or contravention of the law. Vehicle registration number plates in the UK are rectangular or square in shape, with the exact permitted dimensions of the plate and its lettering set down in law. Most plates are white at the front of the vehicle and yellow at the back, with black lettering, with the exception of classic vehicles, which bear black plates at both front and rear with silver text.

Within the UK itself there are currently two numbering and registration systems: one for the island of Great Britain, which is administered by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), and one for Northern Ireland, administered by the Driver &amp; Vehicle Agency (DVA): both have equal status. It is optional to show a national identifier on British number plates. Number plates including the &quot;GB&quot; code are valid in countries party to the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic if displayed on its own or together with the Union Jack.

In 2019, the UK government announced that it was considering introducing green number plates for zero emissions vehicles, making them easier to recognize. Consequently, from 2020, zero-emissions vehicles can receive a green band on the left-hand side of number plate (in the same place as the blue coloured band of the national identifier.)

From 28 September 2021, the UK changed its mark from GB to UK, both in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

Current code format: AB##CDE

1983-2001 code format: A###BCD

1962-1982 code format: ABC###D

== Oceania ==
=== Australia ===




In Australia, vehicle registration plates, usually known as number plates or &#x27;rego plates&#x27;, are normally issued by the State or Territory government; until 2000 some were issued by the Commonwealth government. Plates are associated with a vehicle and generally last for its life, though as they become unreadable (or for other reasons) they may be recalled or replaced with newer ones. New plates are issued when the vehicle is registered in another state, or if the owner requests them (though this depends on state laws).

Australian number plates were originally issued with white characters on black plates, black on white, black on yellow and blue on white, with each state and territory being allocated a range of plates inside the larger range AAA000 to ZZZ999. New South Wales, for example, was allocated AAA000 to FZZ999, Victoria was allocated from GAA000 to MZZ999, Queensland was allocated NAA000 to QZZ999 and South Australia was allocated from RAA000 to TZZ999. Western Australia was allocated UAA000 and XAA000, Tasmania and the Australia Capital Territory were allocated the series beginning with W and Y respectively. This system worked for a few decades but had been almost completely abandoned by 1980, particularly because some states had exhausted their allocated range of combinations. The Northern Territory never adopted the system.

The states then chose their own systems. New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia all retained xxx-nnn, but each started again from AAA-000. Queensland reversed the arrangement to nnn-xxx. Western Australia took nxx-nnn, and the ACT kept the Y plate range but substituted the last digit for a letter, giving Yxx-nnx. In 2013, Victoria became the last state to abandon the xxx-nnn format.

Current arrangements are listed below.

All current plates are manufactured to uniform dimensions and are made of pressed aluminium, except for certain special series plates; the form of which differs by state and design.

In 1942, the government released a new special series only alphabet (XB-AA OPS).

==== Current standard Australian number plate formats ====

; Australian Capital Territory: Blue text on white background, with &quot;ACT&quot; above and &quot;CANBERRA – THE NATION&#x27;S CAPITAL&quot; below.Code format: YAB-12C.
; New South Wales: Black text on yellow background, with &quot;NEW SOUTH WALES&quot; below the plate code. Also in circulation are plates showing &quot;NEW SOUTH WALES – THE FIRST STATE&quot; and &quot;NEW SOUTH WALES – THE PREMIER STATE&quot; with code xxx-nnn, from the 1980s.Code format: AB-12-CD.
; Victoria: Blue on white background, with &quot;VIC – THE EDUCATION STATE&quot; under the plate code. Older plates show, &quot;VIC – STAY ALERT STAY ALIVE&quot;, &quot;VICTORIA – THE PLACE TO BE&quot;, &quot;VICTORIA – ON THE MOVE&quot;, or &quot;VICTORIA – THE GARDEN STATE&quot; in green on white.Code format: 1AB-2CD.
; Queensland: Maroon text (previously green) on white background, with &quot;QUEENSLAND – SUNSHINE STATE&quot; or &quot;QUEENSLAND – THE SMART STATE&quot; under the plate code. Code format: 123-AB4.
; South Australia: Black on white with &quot;SOUTH AUSTRALIA&quot; under code. Code format: S123-ABC.
; Western Australia: Blue on white with &quot;WESTERN AUSTRALIA&quot; on blue band at top of plate. Older plates black on yellow with format nxx-nnn. Code format: 1ABC-234. Even older Western Australian plates use a locality code, followed by a sequential number, e.g. AL 123 being for Albany, plate number 123. Some rural locations added a central dot to signify if the plate was issued for shire- or town-based drivers. This locality based system is still active, although it needs to be offered or asked for at the time of licensing the vehicle.
; Tasmania: Blue on white with &quot;TASMANIA – Explore The Possibilities&quot; at bottom and a thylacine between the first letter and two digits. Older plates may show &quot;TASMANIA – HOLIDAY ISLE&quot; or &quot;TASMANIA – YOUR NATURAL STATE&quot;.Code format: A-12-BC.
; Northern Territory: Orange text on white background with &quot;NT – OUTBACK AUSTRALIA&quot; over code. Code format: CA-12-BC.

To show that a vehicle is registered in Australia, a sticker must be displayed in the lower left corner of either the rear left window or windscreen in annual colors on a six-year cycle: blue, red, purple, brown, green and orange. This sticker is issued to the registered owner of the vehicle upon payment of the next year&#x27;s registration fee, and shows the expiry date of the registration. They are color-coded for easy recognition of the year of expiry. The sticker shows the plate number, vehicle identification number, make, model, and color of the vehicle, along with other such information. This acts as an anti-theft device, because transplanting the plates from one car to another will be in contrast to the details on the sticker.

Code format: 123-A4B

The Western Australia registration sticker shows only the month and year of expiry. However, since the Western Australian police now have such easy access to registration information based on the number plate via in-car computer systems found in all police vehicles, registration stickers in Western Australia have been completely scrapped. As of 1 January 2010 they will no longer be required or made – a move that is said to save at least $2 million over 4 years in costs for printing and postage. Car owners will also feel the relief of not having to perform the tedious task of removing and re-applying the registration sticker every 6–12 months. As of 1 January 2013 NSW have also scrapped registration stickers. NT also scrapped registration stickers as of 1 January 2014. Tasmania scrapped registration stickers as of 1 January 2014.

In the Australian Capital Territory, vehicles under 4.5 tonnes are no longer required to display registration labels as of 1 July 2013.

In Queensland, when all of the 123-ABC combinations had been taken, the plates have the combination 123-AB4. When they run out of combinations for that series the number will move to the left.

Cars owned by the government have special number plates, some also have a crown and symbols.

=== New Zealand ===
The current system used in New Zealand was adopted in 1964, all vehicles were required to have their plates replaced to this system. The original format in this system was xx-nnnn with the original plate being AA1 plates were on a black background with silver text. In 1986 this was changed to a white reflective background with black text with the first plate in this style being NA1. In 2001 the final plate ZZ9999 was printed and the format was changed to ABC-123. In 2006 the text format was changed on all number plates registered after this time.

Personalized number plates were introduced to New Zealand in 1987. Due to the smaller size and population of New Zealand, the same system is used across all of the country. Number plates are usually issued by the New Zealand Transport Agency.

== Antarctica ==
There are no private cars in Antarctica, and therefore there is no vehicle registration authority. There are other vehicles such as tractors and AWDs; however, they are not required to display registration plates.

== Vanity and specialty plates ==

In some countries, people can pay extra and get &quot;vanity plates&quot;: registration plates with custom text. For example, a vanity registration plate might read &quot;MY TOY&quot;. Generally vanity plates are not allowed to have profane, or obscene messages on them, and of course they must also be unique. (DMVs of US states have sometimes received complaints of offensive vanity plates.)

Many countries allow licensed amateur radio operators to obtain registration plates (labeled &quot;Amateur Radio&quot;) with their call signs printed on them, allowing public service officials controlling access to disaster areas to immediately recognize and allow operators into the areas, facilitating their provision of crucial emergency communications. Some U.S. states charge lower fees for ham radio plates than for vanity plates. For example, in Virginia the annual cost of an amateur radio vanity plate is a mere $1.

In the U.S., most provinces of Canada, and Australia, vehicle owners may also pay extra for &quot;specialty plates&quot;: with these, the sequence of letters and digits is chosen by the licensing agency – as with regular plates – but the owners select a plate design that is different from the normal registration plate. Fees for specialty plates are usually channeled to a specific charity or organization. For example, California has issued the &quot;Yosemite plate&quot; and &quot;whale tail plate,&quot; both aimed at conservation efforts in the respective domains. Some jurisdictions allow for these special plates to also be vanity plates, usually for an additional fee on top of the cost of the plate.

In some Australian states, it is possible to purchase &quot;personalized plates&quot;, where an individual can choose the color, design, and sometimes even the shape and size of the plate, as well as the displayed text. For example, the government of the state of Queensland offers a wide range of possibilities for customization, including some emoji. Another style of plate that is common in some states of Australia is &quot;Euro Plates&quot;, which are the same size as European plates (rather than the narrower taller Australian plates) to fit on the number plate holders in European cars.

The world record for the most expensive registration plate is US$14 million. The registration plate &quot;1&quot; was bought at an auction in Abu Dhabi.

== Offensive and prohibited registration plates ==
Some registration plate combinations are banned from being issued by registration authorities. These are typically combinations which, deliberately or otherwise, spell out a message that is likely to offend others. Concerns about what is considered offensive differ from country to country. In the United Kingdom, these have included combinations with sexual connotations such as BO11 LUX and BL04 JOB. The DVLA maintains block lists of possible combinations of letters and digits in an attempt to prevent this. Some prohibited plates reflect religious concerns; for example, in New Jersey, a woman found she was prohibited from registering the plate 8THEIST, but permitted to register BAPTIST. A similar registration for ATHE1ST had been rejected in 2013. Both prohibitions were later lifted. In Manitoba, a plate reading ASIMIL8 was banned as being culturally offensive to indigenous people.
In 2015, Maine passed legislation that removed most censorship from their vanity plate program. Plates like GETFUKT are now allowed.

In some states of Germany license plates that could be mistaken for Nazi codes (with a definition further than Strafgesetzbuch section 86a) are prohibited and in some cases even license plates that had existed for decades were not grandfathered in but had to be changed as stricter regulations were applied. The letter combinations KZ, HJ, SS and SA are not issued for license plates anywhere in Germany due to their Nazi associations.

== Temporary registration plates ==

Some jurisdictions issue temporary registration plates made of cardboard or security paper or even printed on plain paper for newly purchased vehicles, for drivers waiting for plates in the mail, or other registration issues. A common length of time to have temporary plates is 30 days, although Ontario offers ten-day permits, and some U.S. states allow temporary tags to be effective for up to 90 days. Temporary registration plates are usually either attached to the vehicle in place of the rear registration plate or both registration plates or taped to the inside of the rear windshield, while some states require it to be in the front windshield. Expiration dates are usually hand written by regulatory employees or dealership sales personnel, but, due to easy alteration of hand written dates, some states now digitally print the date on the tag. If a driver continues to drive after the permit expires the vehicle can face impounding as an unplated vehicle.

== Novelty registration plates ==
There also exist novelty registration plates often sold in gift or novelty shops. Similar to vanity plates, these novelties are printed with an individual&#x27;s name or other words or phrases, but unlike vanity plates they are not intended for legal identification of an automobile. They can be displayed in the rear window, for example, or on the front of vehicles registered in jurisdictions that only require a valid plate on the rear of the vehicle.

Novelty registration plates are usually installed by motorists or automobile dealerships. While automobile dealerships may install such plates for promoting their business, motorists may install novelty registration plates to express their brand preference or an affiliation with a group, state, country, athletic team, hobby, art, or custom.

Antique auto collectors may use novelty replicas of period registration plates to give their show cars a dated look, or import vehicle owners may use a novelty replica of a foreign plate to give it a foreign image. Some states allow year of manufacture registrations where an original, official plate expiring on the model year of an antique car is revalidated. Wisconsin, for instance, permits the use of year-of-manufacture plates if the state-issued plates are also carried somewhere within the vehicle. California and Ohio also allow the year-of-manufacture plates.

== Registration plate accessories ==

Today, plates are commonly attached with screws that mount into threaded fittings on the vehicle but originally nut-and-bolt combinations were needed to fasten the plate to a bracket, which led to the use of varied registration plate ornaments, accessories and attachments. The most common of these include fastening bolts with ornamental heads in a myriad of styles; these are generally legal everywhere providing the plate itself is not obscured. Those bolts faced with a colored glass or plastic reflector are termed registration plate jewels. Traditionally the front plate would be fastened by an amber or green jewel and the rear by a red jewel, but other colors have become available over the decades including blue, clear and, most recently, purple.

The manufacture and use of registration plate toppers – attachments and accessories mounted atop plates, often as advertising premiums – has diminished because of the design of modern vehicle bodies that incorporate recessed plate mountings. But older vehicles will usually have room for such attachments that may mention vehicle dealerships, tourist attractions and petroleum companies. Some of these commercial toppers also incorporate one or more reflectors or a safety-related message. Large stand-alone glass or plastic reflectors or cataphotes – some imprinted with an advertising message – are still common plate toppers whenever registration-plate brackets are able to accommodate them.

== International codes ==

According to the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, vehicles in cross-border traffic are obliged to display a distinguishing sign of the country of registration on the rear of the vehicle. This sign may either be placed separately from the registration plate or may be incorporated into the vehicle registration plate. When the distinguishing sign is incorporated into the registration plate, it must also appear on the front registration plate of the vehicle, and may be supplemented with the flag or emblem of the national state, or the emblem of the regional economic integration organization to which the country belongs. The distinguishing sign should be displayed on the far left or far right on the registration plate. When a symbol/flag/emblem is also displayed, the distinguishing sign shall obligatorily be placed on the far left on the plate. The distinguishing sign shall be positioned so to be easy identifiable and so that it cannot be confused with the registration number or impair its legibility. The distinguishing sign shall therefore be at least a different color from the registration number, or have a different background color to that reserved for the registration number, or be clearly separated from the registration number, preferably with a line.

The physical requirements for the separate sign are defined in Annex 3 of the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, which states that the letters shall be in black on a white background having the shape of an ellipse with the major axis horizontal. The distinguishing sign should not be affixed in such a way that it could be confused with the registration number or impair its legibility.

The allocation of codes is maintained by the United Nations (UN) as the &quot;Distinguishing Signs of Vehicles in International Traffic&quot;, being authorized by the UN&#x27;s Geneva Convention on Road Traffic (1949) and Vienna Convention on Road Traffic (1968). Many, but far from all, vehicle codes created since the adoption of ISO 3166 coincide with either the ISO two- or three-letter codes.

=== Imitation international codes ===
In Canada, Mexico and the United States, where the international oval is not used on vehicles from neighboring countries, putting one on a car is a matter of personal choice. This has given rise to a tourist-driven industry of imitation international code stickers. For example, the island of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard off the coast of Massachusetts has &quot;MV&quot;, while the Outer Banks region of North Carolina uses &quot;OBX&quot;. Long Beach Island, New Jersey uses &quot;LBI&quot;, with the letter &quot;I&quot; substituted with an illustration of the island&#x27;s lighthouse. The city of Key West, Florida, uses &quot;KW&quot; as part of its Conch Republic &#x27;rebellion&#x27; from the U.S. There are also YNP ovals, for Yellowstone/Yosemite National Park. Stickers of this sort are usually visibly different from any real international code sticker, but some places sell what could appear to be real stickers, touting that the abbreviation refers to their venue.

In the United Kingdom, imitation international codes are sometimes seen for the various parts of the country. For example, in Scotland, oval stickers with or (Scotland in French and Gaelic respectively) are occasionally seen. In Wales, drivers commonly display &quot;CYM&quot; to indicate (Wales).

In Spain, there are such codes for regionalist movements, such as CAT for Catalonia or AST for Asturias, which can be often seen in their respective regions.

==Debate about extending registration to bicycles==
For many years councils in Australia have debated whether registration should also be required for bicycle riders.

In 2014, Randwick councilor Charles Matthews proposed to impose a $50 registration fee on bicycle riders, which would be used to help fund cycleways being built by the council. This proposal was rejected by other councillors. In 2014 the Victorian council of City of Bayside tried a similar proposal.

<text>Zonophone (early on also rendered as Zon-O-Phone) was a record label founded in 1899 in Camden, New Jersey, by Frank Seaman. The Zonophone name was not that of the company but was applied to records and machines sold by Seaman&#x27;s Universal Talking Machine Company from 1899 to 1903. The name was subsequently acquired by Columbia Records, the Victor Talking Machine Company, and finally the Gramophone Company/EMI Records. It has been used for a number of record publishing labels by these companies.

==1899–1910s==
Emile Berliner, the inventor of the lateral-groove disc record and the Gramophone, formed a partnership with machinist Eldridge R. Johnson, who had improved Berliner&#x27;s Gramophone to the point of marketability, and with former typewriter promoter Frank Seaman. Berliner was to hold the patents; Johnson had manufacturing rights; and Seaman had selling rights.

==1920s–1970s==
In West Africa (primarily today&#x27;s Ghana and Nigeria) Zonophone was used as a label to record and produce Sakara, Juju and Apala music on 78 rpm discs from 1928 to the early 1950s.

<text>Adenocarcinoma (; plural adenocarcinomas or adenocarcinomata ; AC) is a type of cancerous tumor that can occur in several parts of the body. It is defined as neoplasia of epithelial tissue that has glandular origin, glandular characteristics, or both. Adenocarcinomas are part of the larger grouping of carcinomas, but are also sometimes called by more precise terms omitting the word, where these exist. Thus invasive ductal carcinoma, the most common form of breast cancer, is adenocarcinoma but does not use the term in its name—however, esophageal adenocarcinoma does to distinguish it from the other common type of esophageal cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Several of the most common forms of cancer are adenocarcinomas, and the various sorts of adenocarcinoma vary greatly in all their aspects, so that few useful generalizations can be made about them.

In the most specific usage, the glandular origin or traits are exocrine; endocrine gland tumors, such as a VIPoma, an insulinoma, or a pheochromocytoma, are typically not referred to as adenocarcinomas but rather are often called neuroendocrine tumors. Epithelial tissue sometimes includes, but is not limited to, the surface layer of skin, glands, and a variety of other tissue that lines the cavities and organs of the body. Epithelial tissue can be derived embryologically from any of the germ layers (ectoderm, endoderm, or mesoderm). To be classified as adenocarcinoma, the cells do not necessarily need to be part of a gland, as long as they have secretory properties. Adenocarcinoma is the malignant counterpart to adenoma, which is the benign form of such tumors. Sometimes adenomas transform into adenocarcinomas, but most do not.

Well-differentiated adenocarcinomas tend to resemble the glandular tissue that they are derived from, while poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas may not. By staining the cells from a biopsy, a pathologist can determine whether the tumor is an adenocarcinoma or some other type of cancer. Adenocarcinomas can arise in many tissues of the body owing to the ubiquitous nature of glands within the body, and, more fundamentally, to the potency of epithelial cells. While each gland may not be secreting the same substance, as long as there is an exocrine function to the cell, it is considered glandular and its malignant form is therefore named adenocarcinoma.

==Histopathology==
Examples of cancers where adenocarcinomas are a common form:
* esophageal cancer; most cases in the developed world are adenocarcinomas.
* pancreas; over 80% of pancreatic cancers are ductal adenocarcinomas.
* prostate cancer is nearly always adenocarcinoma
* cervical cancer: most is squamous cell cancer, but 10–15% of cervical cancers are adenocarcinomas
* stomach cancer: is almost always an adenocarcinoma but in rare cases are extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphomas (also termed MALT lymphomas).

===Breast===
Most breast cancers start in the ducts or lobules, and are adenocarcinomas. The three most common histopathological types collectively represent approximately three-quarters of breast cancers:
* Invasive ductal carcinoma: 55% of breast cancers
* Ductal carcinoma in situ: 13%
* Invasive lobular carcinoma: 5%

===Colon===

The vast majority of colorectal cancers are adenocarcinomas. This is because the colon has numerous glands. Normal colonic glands tend to be simple and tubular in appearance with a mixture of mucus-secreting goblet cells and water-absorbing cells. These glands secrete mucus into the lumen of the colon to lubricate the feces as they pass towards the rectum.

When these glands undergo a number of changes at the genetic level, they proceed in a predictable manner as they move from benign to an invasive, malignant colon cancer. In their research paper &quot;Lessons from Hereditary Colorectal Cancer&quot;, Vogelstein, et al., suggested that colon cells lose the APC tumor suppressor gene and become a small polyp. Next, they suggested that k-Ras becomes activated and the polyp becomes a small, benign adenoma. The adenoma, lacking the &quot;carcinoma&quot; attached to the end of it, suggests that it is a benign version of the malignant adenocarcinoma. The gastroenterologist uses a colonoscopy to find and remove these adenomas and polyps to prevent them from continuing to acquire genetic changes that will lead to an invasive adenocarcinoma. Vogelstein et al. went on to suggest that loss of the DCC gene and of p53 result in a malignant adenocarcinoma.

===Lung===

Nearly 40% of lung cancers are adenocarcinomas, which usually originates in peripheral lung tissue. Most cases of adenocarcinoma are associated with smoking; however, among people who have smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes in their lifetimes (&quot;never-smokers&quot;), adenocarcinoma is the most common form of lung cancer. A subtype of adenocarcinoma, the bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, is more common in female never-smokers, and may have a better long-term survival.

This cancer usually is seen peripherally in the lungs, as opposed to small cell lung cancer and squamous cell lung cancer, which both tend to be more centrally located.

<text>A portable stove is a cooking stove specially designed to be portable and lightweight, used in camping, picnicking, backpacking, or other use in remote locations where an easily transportable means of cooking or heating is needed. Portable stoves can be used in diverse situations, such as for outdoor food service and catering and in field hospitals.

Since the invention of the portable stove in the 19th century, a wide variety of designs and models have seen use in a number of different applications. Portable stoves can be broken down into several broad categories based on the type of fuel used and stove design: unpressurized stoves that use solid or liquid fuel placed in the burner before ignition; stoves that use a volatile liquid fuel in a pressurized burner; bottled gas stoves; and gravity-fed &quot;spirit&quot; stoves.

==History==

===Early examples===

The shichirin, a lightweight charcoal stove, has been used in Japan in much the same form since at least the Edo period (1603-1868). Old shichirin are mainly ceramic and many can be found in old houses. Most modern Shichirin are made by heating diatomaceous earth, but the raw materials are not uniform. There are also shichirin such as those made with a double inside and outside ceramic structure. The shape is mainly cylindrical, square, or rectangular, and the size also varies. Many varieties of shichirin are made for different uses. In North America, they are also known as &quot;hibachi&quot; or &quot;hibachi-style&quot;.

Early European portable stoves burned animal fat and polar explorers continued to use blubber as a supplement for cooking fuel into the early 20th Century.

===Modern era===
Modern portable stoves emerged from the mid-19th century. French-born chef, Alexis Soyer, became &quot;chef de cuisine&quot; at the Reform Club in London from 1837. He instituted many innovations, including cooking with gas, refrigerators cooled by cold water, and ovens with adjustable temperatures. In 1849 Soyer began to market his portable &quot;magic stove&quot; which allowed people to cook food wherever they were. The design of Soyer&#x27;s &quot;Magic Stove&quot; was based on the same principle as a kerosene lamp, in which a wick is used to draw fuel from a tank or reservoir to a burner.
During the Crimean War, Soyer joined the troops at his own expense to advise the army on cooking. Later he was paid his expenses and wages equivalent to those of a Brigadier-General. He designed his own field stove, the Soyer Stove, and trained and installed in every regiment the &quot;Regimental cook&quot; so that soldiers would get an adequate meal and not suffer from malnutrition or die of food poisoning. Catering standards within the British Army would remain inconsistent, however, and there would not be a single Army Catering Corps until 1945. This is now part of the Royal Logistic Corps, whose catering HQ is called Soyer&#x27;s House. His stove, or adaptions of it, remained in British military service into the late 20th century.

In the 1850s, the famous Alpine mountaineer Francis Fox Tuckett developed an alcohol stove for campers and mountaineers known as the &quot;Russian furnace&quot;. It was also known as the &quot;Rob Roy&quot;, after John MacGregor, the renowned canoeist who was nicknamed &quot;Rob Roy&quot;. MacGregor&#x27;s 1866 book, &quot;A Thousand Miles in the Rob Roy Canoe&quot; was an international success and described his camping methods. Tuckett&#x27;s stove and integral cook kit was designed to hang from a cord in the interior of a tent.

Fridtjof Nansen also developed an alcohol stove in the 1880s based on the work of Adolphus Greely. This improved on early designs and later became the basis for the Trangia cooker.
Carl Richard Nyberg invented the blowtorch in 1882 and began manufacturing Primus stoves a decade later. The first model, called &quot;Viktoria&quot;, was not very successful, but the later &quot;Svea&quot; did better. Other sources credit Frans W Lindqvist for the same thing at the same time.

The use of single burner alcohol stoves for camping, similar to the contemporary Trangia brand, was reported as early as 1919. For many years alcohol-based stoves were used on sailboats rather than stoves using kerosene for safety reasons; these have since been largely replaced by stoves using compressed gas (such as liquefied petroleum gas, butane or propane) in disposable or refillable canisters. Stoves designed for military use, such as the World War II-era G.I. Pocket Stove, were designed to run on gasoline. So-called &quot;white gas&quot; or naphtha is commonly used as a fuel for camping and backpacking stoves, such as the compact Svea 123. Newer camping stoves are capable of burning multiple types of fuel, which makes them well suited for international travel where some particular types of fuel may not be readily available.

The use of lightweight portable stoves for camping became commonplace in Britain and Europe in the latter half of the 19th Century. The practice gained acceptance later in North America, and coincided with increased awareness of the environmental impact that campers and backpackers had on the areas where they travelled.

Prior to their use, the usual practice when backpacking was to build an open fire for cooking from available materials such as fallen branches. The fire scar left on the ground would remain for two or three years before the vegetation recovered. The accumulation of fire scars in heavily travelled areas detracted from the pristine appearance that backpackers expected, leading to more widespread use of portable stoves.

==Uses==
Stoves differ widely in their size and portability. The smallest models are generally termed &quot;backpacking stoves&quot;. They are designed for use in backpacking and bicycle touring, where light weight and small size are paramount considerations. Backpacking stoves consist only of the burner, fuel tank and pot supports. The legs – if any – are often collapsible to minimize the space required. The weight may range from about 1 to 2 ounces (30 to 60 g) for simple alcohol stoves, for MSR-type stoves (without fuel weight) and canister stoves (with gas cartridge), and up to for larger stoves. Single burner alcohol stoves, beverage can stoves, and small liquid fuel and gas canister stoves are well suited for backpacking.

&quot;Camping stoves&quot; are designed for use by people travelling by car, boat, canoe, or on horseback. They are similar in function and ease of use to kitchen stovetops, usually with two burners set into a table-like surface, and often with a folding lid for stowage and wind protection. This increases the weight accordingly.

== Unpressurized liquid-fuel stoves ==

=== Single burner alcohol stoves ===

The simplest type of stove is an unpressurized single burner design, in which the burner contains the fuel and which once lit burns until it is either extinguished or the fuel is exhausted. There are both liquid- and solid-fuel stoves of this variety. Because they are extremely small and lightweight, this type of stove tends to be favored by ultralight backpackers as well as those seeking to minimize weight and bulk, particularly for extended backpacking trips. Solid-fuel stoves are also commonly used in emergency kits both because they are compact and the fuel is very stable over time. These simple stoves are also commonly used when serving fondue.

The Trangia stove is a popular commercial alcohol stove, which is available in many different models, from a single bare burner to an integrated expedition cooking system. Some of these come with a sealing cover, allowing the burner to be packed while still containing fuel, although putting the lid on while the stove is hot can damage the O ring seal (hence it may leak in transit). An even simpler system is the Sterno heater, in which the can that contains a jellied fuel also serves as the burner. Homemade beverage can stoves (or &quot;Pepsi/beer/etc. can stoves&quot;) are similar. These are made from discarded aluminium beverage cans, and come in a wide variety of different designs.

=== Gravity-fed spirit stoves ===
The traditional &quot;spirit stove&quot; (alcohol or methylated spirits) consists of a small reservoir or fuel tank raised above and to the side of the burner. The fuel tank supplies the methylated spirits under gravity to the burner, where it is vaporized and burned.
The gravity-fed spirit stove is still found in many pleasure boats, although it has largely been replaced by compressed gas stoves.

Lighting a gravity-fed spirit stove is similar to lighting a traditional Primus stove. Around each burner is a priming pan used to preheat the burner. To light the stove, the burner is first turned on to allow a small amount of fuel to pass through the burner and collect as a liquid in the priming pan. The burner is then turned off, and the fuel ignited to preheat the burner. When the fuel in the pan is almost all gone, the burner is turned on again, and fuel passes into the burner where it is vaporized and passes through the jets.

These stoves look and even sound a bit like pressurized burner stoves, but the fuel tank is under no pressure. They remain popular for small boats owing to the minimal fire risk they pose in a confined space.

=== Wicking stoves ===

Wicking stoves are typically fueled by alcohol or kerosene.

==== Platinum Catalysis stove ====

Humphry Davy discovered the use of platinum in catalysis. In which a catalytic body is interposed in the path of a combustible vapor and is heated upon its passage through the catalytic body sufficiently to unite with the air upon egress from the catalytic body and then to burn upon the surface of the catalytic body. These stoves are typically described as wind-resistant, infrared, or radiant.

== Pressurized liquid fuel stoves ==

=== Primus stoves ===

The introduction of the first pressurized burner portable stove is generally credited to Frans Wilhelm Lindqvist, in 1892. Lindqvist&#x27;s stove was based on the pressurized blowtorch but fitted with an upturned burner assembly of his own design. Together with partner J.V. Svensson, Lindqvist established the Primus brand of stove, which quickly developed into a worldwide market leader.

The kerosene burning Primus stoves and their imitators were made of brass and were a significant advance over previous designs, which had used a wick to supply liquid fuel to the burner by capillary action. The Primus burner vaporized the fuel in a loop of pipe which rose up from the fuel tank at the stove&#x27;s base, and which was pre-heated with alcohol (or &quot;methylated spirits&quot;) before being combusted in the burner. Initial pressure is provided by a small, hand-operated pump integrated into the stove&#x27;s fuel tank. The flame on a Primus stove is adjusted by using the pump to increase the pressure in the tank to make the flame larger, or by venting the tank to reduce the pressure and make the flame smaller. Later models used a separate valve to adjust the flame. Primus-style stoves were made in a variety of sizes and styles, and many were designed to be disassembled for storage and transportation in a separate case.

=== Compact camping and hiking stoves ===

Smaller, more compact stoves were developed in the early 20th century that used petrol (gasoline), which at that time was similar to so-called white gas and did not have the additives and other constituents contained in modern gasoline. Similar in design to the kerosene-burning Primus-style stove, the smaller white gas stove was also made of brass with the fuel tank at the base and the burner assembly at the top. Unlike the Primus-style stove, however, priming both pressurizes the tank and pre-heats the burner assembly in this type of stove. Once lit, the heat from the burner maintains the pressure in the tank until the flame is extinguished. The Svea 123, introduced in 1955, is among the most popular of these &quot;self pressurizing&quot; stove designs, and is generally considered to be the first compact camping stove. Optimus of Sweden manufactures a line of similarly designed stoves in which the stove&#x27;s components are entirely enclosed in a folding metal case, the most popular of which were the Optimus 8R and 111 (still in production as the Optimus Hiker). The Coleman Company developed a small white gas stove with integral fuel tank for the US Army in World War II, the &quot;GI pocket stove&quot;. Coleman still makes similar stoves, such as the 442, 533 and 550B (the latter of which can also run on kerosene). These stoves have a pump to build up initial pressure in the fuel tank, but are generally self-pressurising when running (occasional re-pumping may be necessary if the stove is run at full output).

In the early 1970s Mountain Safety Research (MSR) designed a pressurized burner stove intended to address performance shortcomings of white gas stoves in cold or adverse conditions, in particular for mountaineering use. First introduced in 1973 and designated the Model 9 (and later as the XGK Expedition), the MSR stove had four main parts: a free-standing burner assembly with integrated pot supports; the fuel bottle, which doubles as the stove&#x27;s fuel tank; a pump that screws into the bottle; and a flexible tube or pipeline connecting the pump/bottle assembly to the burner assembly. This type of stove design, with the &quot;outboard&quot; fuel tank held away from the burner, is primed in the same manner as other white gas stoves; however, because the tank is not self-pressurizing, the tank must periodically be pumped to maintain pressure to the burner. Most commercial liquid fuel camping stoves on the market today are of this design.

Pressurized burner stoves are now available that can burn several different fuels or volatile liquids, including alcohol, gasoline or other motor fuels, kerosene, and jet propellant. Little or no modification is needed; due to variability of the volatility of different fuels, the jets of multi-fuel stoves may need to be changed for the different fuels, and many others.

=== Coiled burner stoves ===

The &quot;coiled burner&quot; stove is a variant on the pressurized burner design, in which the burner assembly consists of a coiled loop with a small hole in the lower part, through which the vaporized fuel exits and combusts. Generally small, lightweight and cheaply made, these were sold under the brand name &quot;Stesco&quot;, &quot;Tay-Kit&quot;, &quot;Handy Camper&quot; and others. A more substantial version of the coiled burner stove is the Swiss-made stove.

=== Gas cartridge stoves ===
The design of most portable gas cartridge stoves is similar to that of many pressurized burner stoves, except the fuel tank or cartridge contains a liquefied gas – typically butane, propane or a mixture of hydrocarbons – that is held under pressure. While the gas in the cartridge is in a liquid state when stored under pressure, it vaporizes immediately as it leaves the storage bottle (i.e., without priming), arriving at the burner as a gas. The principal advantage of gas cartridge stoves is convenience: no priming is required, they are generally maintenance-free and capable of immediate high heat output, the flame is easily adjusted and they are generally considered simpler to operate. There are two basic designs for most gas cartridge stoves used for camping: the burner assembly is fitted into the top of the gas cartridge, which serves as the stove&#x27;s base, or the stove is free-standing and the cartridge is separated from the burner and connected by means of a small hose or pipe. Single burner propane stoves commonly used in food service have the gas container integrated into the body of the stove. Butane cartridges are almost exclusively manufactured in South Korea with the only exception being one manufacturer in Houston, Texas. Butane canisters manufactured in South Korea contain butane from Saudi Arabia, while the American manufacturer fills canisters with domestic butane.

Gas cartridges for camping stoves tend to be costly and usually are not refillable. Single-use cartridges are considered objectionable by some on environmental grounds. They perform poorly in cold weather. Until the approval of EN 417-specification Lindal valve cartridges of 1992 there was little compatibility between different makers and systems, and cartridges for older cartridge stoves were often unobtainable. Outside of camping, single-burner stoves using cans of compressed butane gas are used for catering and other food service applications.

Refillable gas bottles are heavier, and tend to be used on larger stoves intended for car camping, expedition base camps, and residential use (as for barbecues).

=== Multiple burner stoves ===

Stoves with two or more burners that may be operated together or separately are common for use in base camp, car camping and other situations involving cooking for larger groups. The folding &quot;suitcase&quot; style by Coleman is the best known of this design, and is intended to be used on a flat, stable surface such as a tabletop. This type of stove may have a separate fuel tank for each burner, or more commonly a single tank shared by both burners. Multiple burner stoves generally use compressed gas, alcohol or Naphtha (also known as White gas or Coleman fuel).

== Solid-fuel stoves ==
A solid-fuel stove may consist of no more than a metal base plate and container to hold the fuel, a set of legs to keep this assembly out of contact with the ground, and some supports for a billycan or other cooking vessel. This design is scalable, and may be used for anything from tiny backpacking stoves to large portable woodstoves. Fuel may be manufactured, e.g., hexamine, or natural, e.g., woody forest debris.

=== Manufactured fuel ===

Among compact commercial models, the Esbit hexamine stove burns small tablets of hexamine or trioxane in a folding stand made of aluminium or other base metal, and is a German design that dates from World War II. Generally intended for use by a single person, the fumes will tend to taint food if exposed to the burning tablets, and will also leave a messy residue that may be difficult to remove from cookware.

Outside of America, metaldehyde is used as a solid fuel in small portable stoves. It is a lightweight fuel with little smell that burns leaving no residue. It is however toxic to animals including humans if ingested and metaldehyde fuel tablets need to be handled with care to avoid inadvertent ingestion.

=== Natural fuel, forest wood debris ===

Stoves that use natural solid fuel, e.g., wood and other forest debris, have an obvious advantage: the user need not carry any stove fuel on his or her back. This native fuel typically consists of twigs and small pine cones the user gathers at their campsite and places in the fuel chamber of their stove. This substitution of natural fuel for artificial fuel can amount to a savings of several ounces or pounds of fuel and their containers not carried in a traveler&#x27;s pack, depending on length of trip. Issues of plumbing connections, fuel toxicity, leakage, spillage, and stove flareup are also nonexistent when using a solid-fuel portable stove. Contribution to climate change and dependence on fossil fuel is also minimized when using a portable stove powered by a local, renewable biomass resource (however, carbon dioxide is released no matter what source of fuel you use).

While simple, solid-fuel stoves have some disadvantages versus their liquid-fueled counterparts. In most cases, the burn rate may be controlled only by varying the amount of fuel placed on the fire, while fluid fuels may be controlled precisely with valves. In addition, no solid fuel burns completely. Solid-fuel stoves produce a small amount of ash, and they can coat the bottoms of cooking vessels with tars and soot. In addition, because some of the chemical energy of the fuel remains locked up in the smoke and soot, solid fuel releases less heat, gram for gram.

A simple hobo stove is constructed out of a discarded tin can of any size by removing the top of the can, punching a number of holes near the upper edge, and punching corresponding holes in the opposite base. Wood or other fuel is placed in the can and ignited. A pot (or larger tin can) is placed on the top of the can for cooking. Stoves of similar design can be made out of materials other than cans, such as discarded duct pipe. More complex stoves may use a double-walled design with a chamber for partial biomass gasification and additional mixing to increase heat output and provide a cleaner, more complete burn.

Another type of a solid fuel stove which has been becoming more common is what is called the rocket stove. It is found more commonly in lesser-developed countries where wood fuel sources are more scarce. There are several different designs that are used but smaller ones are portable and are made of steel and other materials with insulation inside a double-walled design with a chamber for partial biomass gasification and additional mixing of air and wood gas to increase heat output and provide a cleaner, more-complete burn. The advantage of these rocket stoves is their requiring little fuel, such as wood and dry weeds, to cook a meal, and with this less air pollution.

The single AA battery operated, fan-driven Sierra &quot;Zip&quot; stove burns small twigs, pinecones, bark, or other small flammable items. The fuel is placed into a small chamber and, with the fan turned on, burns at a high heat output of 15,000 BTUs/hr (4.40 kW), about twice that of typical gasoline stoves. Because the wood burns quickly in a Zip stove, it needs to be constantly refueled during cooking. However, because of its ability to take advantage of whatever small bits of wood that can be scrounged from the forest floor, the additional weight and bulk of packing additional fuel supplies is avoided. Ed Garvey, the noted Appalachian trail benefactor and multiple A.T. thru-hiker, carried a Zip stove with him when he hiked the A.T. at the age of 75.

<doc id="237248" wikidata="Q237151" url="?curid=237248" title="Medical ethics">
<text>Medical ethics is an applied branch of ethics which analyzes the practice of clinical medicine and related scientific research. Medical ethics is based on a set of values that professionals can refer to in the case of any confusion or conflict. These values include the respect for autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence, and justice. Such tenets may allow doctors, care providers, and families to create a treatment plan and work towards the same common goal. These four values are not ranked in order of importance or relevance and they all encompass values pertaining to medical ethics. However, a conflict may arise leading to the need for hierarchy in an ethical system, such that some moral elements overrule others with the purpose of applying the best moral judgement to a difficult medical situation. Medical ethics is particularly relevant in decisions regarding involuntary treatment and involuntary commitment.

There are several codes of conduct. The Hippocratic Oath discusses basic principles for medical professionals. This document dates back to the fifth century BCE. Both The Declaration of Helsinki (1964) and The Nuremberg Code (1947) are two well-known and well respected documents contributing to medical ethics. Other important markings in the history of medical ethics include &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; in 1973 and the development of hemodialysis in the 1960s. With hemodialysis now available, but a limited number of dialysis machines to treat patients, an ethical question arose on which patients to treat and which ones not to treat, and which factors to use in making such a decision. More recently, new techniques for gene editing aiming at treating, preventing and curing diseases utilizing gene editing, are raising important moral questions about their applications in medicine and treatments as well as societal impacts on future generations.

As this field continues to develop and change throughout history, the focus remains on fair, balanced, and moral thinking across all cultural and religious backgrounds around the world. The field of medical ethics encompasses both practical application in clinical settings and scholarly work in philosophy, history, and sociology.

Medical ethics encompasses beneficence, autonomy, and justice as they relate to conflicts such as euthanasia, patient confidentiality, informed consent, and conflicts of interest in healthcare. In addition, medical ethics and culture are interconnected as different cultures implement ethical values differently, sometimes placing more emphasis on family values and downplaying the importance of autonomy. This leads to an increasing need for culturally sensitive physicians and ethical committees in hospitals and other healthcare settings.

== Medical ethics relationships ==
Medical ethics defines relationships in the following directions:

* a medical worker — a patient;
* a medical worker — a healthy person (relatives);
* a medical worker — a medical worker.

Medical ethics includes provisions on medical confidentiality, medical errors, iatrogenesis, duties of the doctor and the patient.

Medical ethics is closely related to bioethics, but these are not identical concepts. Since the science of bioethics arose in an evolutionary way in the continuation of the development of medical ethics, it covers a wider range of issues.

Medical ethics is also related to the law. But ethics and law are not identical concepts. More often than not, ethics implies a higher standard of behavior than the law dictates.

==History==
The term medical ethics first dates back to 1803, when English author and physician Thomas Percival published a document describing the requirements and expectations of medical professionals within medical facilities. The Code of Ethics was then adapted in 1847, relying heavily on Percival&#x27;s words. Over the years in 1903, 1912, and 1947, revisions have been made to the original document. The practice of medical ethics is widely accepted and practiced throughout the world.

Historically, Western medical ethics may be traced to guidelines on the duty of physicians in antiquity, such as the Hippocratic Oath, and early Christian teachings. The first code of medical ethics, &quot;Formula Comitis Archiatrorum&quot;, was published in the 5th century, during the reign of the Ostrogothic Christian king Theodoric the Great. In the medieval and early modern period, the field is indebted to Islamic scholarship such as Ishaq ibn Ali al-Ruhawi (who wrote the &quot;Conduct of a Physician&quot;, the first book dedicated to medical ethics), Avicenna&#x27;s &quot;Canon of Medicine&quot; and Muhammad ibn Zakariya ar-Razi (known as Rhazes in the West), Jewish thinkers such as Maimonides, Roman Catholic scholastic thinkers such as Thomas Aquinas, and the case-oriented analysis (casuistry) of Catholic moral theology. These intellectual traditions continue in Catholic, Islamic and Jewish medical ethics.

By the 18th and 19th centuries, medical ethics emerged as a more self-conscious discourse. In England, Thomas Percival, a physician and author, crafted the first modern code of medical ethics. He drew up a pamphlet with the code in 1794 and wrote an expanded version in 1803, in which he coined the expressions &quot;medical ethics&quot; and &quot;medical jurisprudence&quot;. However, there are some who see Percival&#x27;s guidelines that relate to physician consultations as being excessively protective of the home physician&#x27;s reputation. Jeffrey Berlant is one such critic who considers Percival&#x27;s codes of physician consultations as being an early example of the anti-competitive, &quot;guild&quot;-like nature of the physician community. In addition, since the mid 19th century up to the 20th century, physician-patient relationships that once were more familiar became less prominent and less intimate, sometimes leading to malpractice, which resulted in less public trust and a shift in decision-making power from the paternalistic physician model to today&#x27;s emphasis on patient autonomy and self-determination.

In 1815, the Apothecaries Act was passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It introduced compulsory apprenticeship and formal qualifications for the apothecaries of the day under the license of the Society of Apothecaries. This was the beginning of regulation of the medical profession in the UK.

In 1847, the American Medical Association adopted its first code of ethics, with this being based in large part upon Percival&#x27;s work. While the secularized field borrowed largely from Catholic medical ethics, in the 20th century a distinctively liberal Protestant approach was articulated by thinkers such as Joseph Fletcher. In the 1960s and 1970s, building upon liberal theory and procedural justice, much of the discourse of medical ethics went through a dramatic shift and largely reconfigured itself into bioethics.

Well-known medical ethics cases include:
* Albert Kligman&#x27;s dermatology experiments
* Deep sleep therapy
* Doctors&#x27; Trial
* &quot;Greenberg v. Miami Children&#x27;s Hospital Research Institute&quot;
* Henrietta Lacks
* Chester M. Southam&#x27;s Cancer Injection Study
* Human radiation experiments
* Jesse Gelsinger
* &quot;Moore v. Regents of the University of California&quot;
* Medical Experimentation on Black Americans
* Milgram experiment
* Radioactive iodine experiments
* The Monster Study
* Plutonium injections
* The David Reimer case
* The Stanford Prison Experiment
* Tuskegee syphilis experiment
* Willowbrook State School
* Yanomami blood sample collection
** &quot;Darkness in El Dorado&quot;

Since the 1970s, the growing influence of ethics in contemporary medicine can be seen in the increasing use of institutional review boards to evaluate experiments on human subjects, the establishment of hospital ethics committees, the expansion of the role of clinician ethicists, and the integration of ethics into many medical school curricula.

=== COVID-19 ===

In December 2019, the virus COVID-19 emerged as a threat to worldwide public health and, over the following years, ignited novel inquiry into modern-age medical ethics. For example, since the first discovery of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, and subsequent global spread by mid-2020, calls for the adoption of open science principles dominated research communities. Some academics believed that open science principles — like constant communication between research groups, rapid translation of study results into public policy, and transparency of scientific processes to the public — represented the only solutions to halt the impact of the virus. Others, however, cautioned that these interventions may lead to side-stepping safety in favor of speed, wasteful use of research capital, and creation of public confusion. Drawbacks of these practices include resource-wasting and public confusion surrounding the use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as treatment for COVID-19 — a combination which was later shown to have no impact on COVID-19 survivorship and carried notable cardiotoxic side-effects — as well as a type of vaccine hesitancy specifically due to the speed at which COVID-19 vaccines were created and made publicly available. However, open science also allowed for the rapid implementation of life-saving public interventions like wearing masks and social distancing, the rapid development of multiple vaccines and monoclonal antibodies that have significantly lowered transmission and death rates, and increased public awareness about the severity of the pandemic as well as explanation of daily protective actions against COVID-19 infection, like hand washing.

Other notable areas of medicine impacted by COVID-19 ethics include:

* Resource rationing, especially in intensive care units that did not have enough ventilators or beds to serve the influx of severely ill patients.
* Lack of PPE for providers, putting them at increased risk of infection during patient care.
* Heavy burden on healthcare providers and essential workers during entirety of pandemic
* Closure of schools and increase in virtual schooling, which presented issues for families with limited internet access.
* Magnification of disparities in health, causing the pandemic to impact BIPOC and disabled communities more so than other demographics worldwide.
* Increase in hate crimes towards Asian-Americans, specifically Chinese-Americans related to COVID-19 related xenophobia.
* Closure of businesses, offices, and restaurants resulted in increased unemployment and economic recession.
* Vaccine hesitancy.
* Refusal to mask or social distance, increasing transmission rates.
* Cessation of non-essential medical procedures, delay of routine care, and conversion to telehealth as clinics and hospitals remained overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients.

The ethics of COVID-19 spans many more areas of medicine and society than represented in this paragraph — some of these principles will likely not be discovered until the end of the pandemic which, as of September 12, 2022, is still ongoing.

==Values==
A common framework used when analysing medical ethics is the &quot;four principles&quot; approach postulated by Tom Beauchamp and James Childress in their textbook &quot;Principles of Biomedical Ethics&quot;. It recognizes four basic moral principles, which are to be judged and weighed against each other, with attention given to the scope of their application. The four principles are:

* Respect for autonomy – the patient has the right to refuse or choose their treatment. 
* Beneficence – a practitioner should act in the best interest of the patient.
* Non-maleficence – to not be the cause of harm. Also, &quot;Utility&quot; – to promote more good than harm.
* Justice – concerns the distribution of scarce health resources, and the decision of who gets what treatment.

===Patient autonomy===
The principle of autonomy, broken down into &quot;autos&quot; (self) and &quot;nomos (rule), views the rights of an individual to self-determination. This is rooted in society&#x27;s respect for individuals&#x27; ability to make informed decisions about personal matters with freedom. Autonomy has become more important as social values have shifted to define medical quality in terms of outcomes that are important to the patient and their family rather than medical professionals. The increasing importance of autonomy can be seen as a social reaction against the &quot;paternalistic&quot; tradition within healthcare. Some have questioned whether the backlash against historically excessive paternalism in favor of patient autonomy has inhibited the proper use of soft paternalism to the detriment of outcomes for some patients.

The definition of autonomy is the ability of an individual to make a rational, uninfluenced decision. Therefore, it can be said that autonomy is a general indicator of a healthy mind and body. The progression of many terminal diseases are characterized by loss of autonomy, in various manners and extents. For example, dementia, a chronic and progressive disease that attacks the brain, can induce memory loss and cause a decrease in rational thinking, almost always results in the loss of autonomy.

Psychiatrists and clinical psychologists are often asked to evaluate a patient&#x27;s capacity for making life-and-death decisions at the end of life. Persons with a psychiatric condition such as delirium or clinical depression may lack capacity to make end-of-life decisions. For these persons, a request to refuse treatment may be taken in the context of their condition. Unless there is a clear advance directive to the contrary, persons lacking mental capacity are treated according to their best interests. This will involve an assessment involving people who know the person best to what decisions the person would have made had they not lost capacity. Persons with the mental capacity to make end-of-life decisions may refuse treatment with the understanding that it may shorten their life. Psychiatrists and psychologists may be involved to support decision making.

The physician autonomy is a related though distinct concept.

===Beneficence===

The term beneficence refers to actions that promote the well-being of others. In the medical context, this means taking actions that serve the best interests of patients and their families. However, uncertainty surrounds the precise definition of which practices do in fact help patients.

James Childress and Tom Beauchamp in &quot;Principles of Biomedical Ethics&quot; (1978) identify beneficence as one of the core values of healthcare ethics. Some scholars, such as Edmund Pellegrino, argue that beneficence is the &quot;only&quot; fundamental principle of medical ethics. They argue that healing should be the sole purpose of medicine, and that endeavors like cosmetic surgery and euthanasia are severely unethical and against the Hippocratic Oath.

===Non-maleficence===

The concept of non-maleficence is embodied by the phrase, &quot;first, do no harm,&quot; or the Latin, &quot;primum non nocere&quot;. Many consider that should be the main or primary consideration (hence &quot;primum&quot;): that it is more important not to harm your patient, than to do them good, which is part of the Hippocratic oath that doctors take. This is partly because enthusiastic practitioners are prone to using treatments that they believe will do good, without first having evaluated them adequately to ensure they do no harm to the patient. Much harm has been done to patients as a result, as in the saying, &quot;The treatment was a success, but the patient died.&quot; It is not only more important to do no harm than to do good; it is also important to &quot;know&quot; how likely it is that your treatment will harm a patient. So a physician should go further than not prescribing medications they know to be harmful—he or she should not prescribe medications (or otherwise treat the patient) unless s/he knows that the treatment is unlikely to be harmful; or at the very least, that patient understands the risks and benefits, and that the likely benefits outweigh the likely risks.

In practice, however, many treatments carry some risk of harm. In some circumstances, e.g. in desperate situations where the outcome without treatment will be grave, risky treatments that stand a high chance of harming the patient will be justified, as the risk of not treating is also very likely to do harm. So the principle of &quot;non-maleficence&quot; is not absolute, and balances against the principle of &quot;beneficence&quot; (doing good), as the effects of the two principles together often give rise to a &quot;double effect&quot; (further described in next section). Even basic actions like taking a blood sample or an injection of a drug cause harm to the patient&#x27;s body. Euthanasia also goes against the principle of beneficence because the patient dies as a result of the medical treatment by the doctor.

Medical authoritarianism or authoritarian personality can contribute to medical harms.

====Double effect====

&quot;Double effect&quot; refers to two types of consequences that may be produced by a single action, and in medical ethics it is usually regarded as the combined effect of beneficence and non-maleficence.

A commonly cited example of this phenomenon is the use of morphine or other analgesic in the dying patient. Such use of morphine can have the beneficial effect of easing the pain and suffering of the patient while simultaneously having the maleficent effect of shortening the life of the patient through the deactivation of the respiratory system.

===Respect for human rights===

The human rights era started with the formation of the United Nations in 1945, which was charged with the promotion of human rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) was the first major document to define human rights. Medical doctors have an ethical duty to protect the human rights and human dignity of the patient so the advent of a document that defines human rights has had its effect on medical ethics. Most codes of medical ethics now require respect for the human rights of the patient.

The Council of Europe promotes the rule of law and observance of human rights in Europe. The Council of Europe adopted the &quot;European Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine&quot; (1997) to create a uniform code of medical ethics for its 47 member-states. The Convention applies international human rights law to medical ethics. It provides special protection of physical integrity for those who are unable to consent, which includes children. 

As of December 2013, the convention had been ratified or acceded to by twenty-nine member-states of the Council of Europe.

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) also promotes the protection of human rights and human dignity. According to UNESCO, &quot;Declarations are another means of defining norms, which are not subject to ratification. Like recommendations, they set forth universal principles to which the community of States wished to attribute the greatest possible authority and to afford the broadest possible support.&quot; UNESCO adopted the &quot;Universal Declaration on Human Rights and Biomedicine&quot; (2005) to advance the application of international human rights law in medical ethics. The Declaration provides special protection of human rights for incompetent persons. 
=== Solidarity ===
Individualistic standards of autonomy and personal human rights as they relate to social justice seen in the Anglo-Saxon community, clash with and can also supplement the concept of solidarity, which stands closer to a European healthcare perspective focused on community, universal welfare, and the unselfish wish to provide healthcare equally for all. In the United States individualistic and self-interested healthcare norms are upheld, whereas in other countries, including European countries, a sense of respect for the community and personal support is more greatly upheld in relation to free healthcare.

=== Acceptance of ambiguity in medicine ===

The concept of normality, that there is a human physiological standard contrasting with conditions of illness, abnormality and pain, leads to assumptions and bias that negatively affects health care practice. It is important to realize that normality is ambiguous and that ambiguity in healthcare and the acceptance of such ambiguity is necessary in order to practice humbler medicine and understand complex, sometimes unusual usual medical cases. Thus, society&#x27;s views on central concepts in philosophy and clinical beneficence must be questioned and revisited, adopting ambiguity as a central player in medical practice.

==Conflicts==

===Between beneficence and non-maleficence===
Beneficence can come into conflict with non-maleficence when healthcare professionals are deciding between a “first, do no harm” approach vs. a “first, do good” approach, such as when deciding whether or not to operate when the balance between the risk and benefit of the operation is not known and must be estimated. Healthcare professionals who place beneficence below other principles like non-maleficence may decide not to help a patient more than a limited amount if they feel they have met the standard of care and are not morally obligated to provide additional services. Young and Wagner argued that, in general, beneficence takes priority over non-maleficence (“first, do good,” not “first, do no harm”), both historically and philosophically.

===Between autonomy and beneficence/non-maleficence===
Autonomy can come into conflict with beneficence when patients disagree with recommendations that healthcare professionals believe are in the patient&#x27;s best interest. When the patient&#x27;s interests conflict with the patient&#x27;s welfare, different societies settle the conflict in a wide range of manners. In general, Western medicine defers to the wishes of a mentally competent patient to make their own decisions, even in cases where the medical team believes that they are not acting in their own best interests. However, many other societies prioritize beneficence over autonomy. People deemed to not be mentally competent or having a mental disorder may be treated involuntarily.

Examples include when a patient does not want treatment because of, for example, religious or cultural views. In the case of euthanasia, the patient, or relatives of a patient, may want to end the life of the patient. Also, the patient may want an unnecessary treatment, as can be the case in hypochondria or with cosmetic surgery; here, the practitioner may be required to balance the desires of the patient for medically unnecessary potential risks against the patient&#x27;s informed autonomy in the issue. A doctor may want to prefer autonomy because refusal to respect the patient&#x27;s self-determination would harm the doctor-patient relationship.

Organ donations can sometimes pose interesting scenarios, in which a patient is classified as a non-heart beating donor (NHBD), where life support fails to restore the heartbeat and is now considered futile but brain death has not occurred. Classifying a patient as a NHBD can qualify someone to be subject to non-therapeutic intensive care, in which treatment is only given to preserve the organs that will be donated and not to preserve the life of the donor. This can bring up ethical issues as some may see respect for the donors wishes to donate their healthy organs as respect for autonomy, while others may view the sustaining of futile treatment during vegetative state maleficence for the patient and the patient&#x27;s family. Some are worried making this process a worldwide customary measure may dehumanize and take away from the natural process of dying and what it brings along with it.

Individuals&#x27; capacity for informed decision-making may come into question during resolution of conflicts between autonomy and beneficence. The role of surrogate medical decision-makers is an extension of the principle of autonomy.

On the other hand, autonomy and beneficence/non-maleficence may also overlap. For example, a breach of patients&#x27; autonomy may cause decreased confidence for medical services in the population and subsequently less willingness to seek help, which in turn may cause inability to perform beneficence.

The principles of autonomy and beneficence/non-maleficence may also be expanded to include effects on the relatives of patients or even the medical practitioners, the overall population and economic issues when making medical decisions.

===Euthanasia===
There is disagreement among American physicians as to whether the non-maleficence principle excludes the practice of euthanasia. Euthanasia is currently legal in the states of Washington, DC, California, Colorado, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington. Around the world, there are different organizations that campaign to change legislation about the issue of physician-assisted death, or PAD. Examples of such organizations are the Hemlock Society of the United States and the Dignity in Dying campaign in the United Kingdom. These groups believe that doctors should be given the right to end a patient&#x27;s life only if the patient is conscious enough to decide for themselves, is knowledgeable about the possibility of alternative care, and has willingly asked to end their life or requested access to the means to do so.

This argument is disputed in other parts of the world. For example, in the state of Louisiana, giving advice or supplying the means to end a person&#x27;s life is considered a criminal act and can be charged as a felony. In state courts, this crime is comparable to manslaughter. The same laws apply in the states of Mississippi and Nebraska.

==Informed consent==

Informed consent refers to a patient&#x27;s right to receive information relevant to a recommended treatment, in order to be able to make a well-considered, voluntary decision about their care. To give informed consent, a patient must be competent to make a decision regarding their treatment and be presented with relevant information regarding a treatment recommendation, including its nature and purpose, and the burdens, risks and potential benefits of all options and alternatives. After receiving and understanding this information, the patient can then make a fully informed decision to either consent or refuse treatment. In certain circumstances, there can be an exception to the need for informed consent, including, but not limited to, in cases of a medical emergency or patient incompetency. The ethical concept of informed consent also applies in a clinical research setting; all human participants in research must voluntarily decide to participate in the study after being fully informed of all relevant aspects of the research trial necessary to decide whether to participate or not. Informed consent is both an ethical and legal duty; if proper consent is not received prior to a procedure, treatment, or participation in research, providers can be held liable for battery and/or other torts. In the United States, informed consent is governed by both federal and state law, and the specific requirements for obtaining informed consent vary state to state.

==Confidentiality==

Confidentiality is commonly applied to conversations between doctors and patients. This concept is commonly known as patient-physician privilege. Legal protections prevent physicians from revealing their discussions with patients, even under oath in court.

Confidentiality is mandated in the United States by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 known as HIPAA, specifically the Privacy Rule, and various state laws, some more rigorous than HIPAA. However, numerous exceptions to the rules have been carved out over the years. For example, many states require physicians to report gunshot wounds to the police and impaired drivers to the Department of Motor Vehicles. Confidentiality is also challenged in cases involving the diagnosis of a sexually transmitted disease in a patient who refuses to reveal the diagnosis to a spouse, and in the termination of a pregnancy in an underage patient, without the knowledge of the patient&#x27;s parents. Many states in the U.S. have laws governing parental notification in underage abortion. Those working in mental health have a duty to warn those who they deem to be at risk from their patients in some countries.

Traditionally, medical ethics has viewed the duty of confidentiality as a relatively non-negotiable tenet of medical practice. More recently, critics like Jacob Appel have argued for a more nuanced approach to the duty that acknowledges the need for flexibility in many cases.

Confidentiality is an important issue in primary care ethics, where physicians care for many patients from the same family and community, and where third parties often request information from the considerable medical database typically gathered in primary health care.

===Privacy and the Internet===
In increasing frequency, medical researchers are researching activities in online environments such as discussion boards and bulletin boards, and there is concern that the requirements of informed consent and privacy are not applied, although some guidelines do exist.

One issue that has arisen, however, is the disclosure of information. While researchers wish to quote from the original source in order to argue a point, this can have repercussions when the identity of the patient is not kept confidential. The quotations and other information about the site can be used to identify the patient, and researchers have reported cases where members of the site, bloggers and others have used this information as &#x27;clues&#x27; in a game in an attempt to identify the site. Some researchers have employed various methods of &quot;heavy disguise.&quot; including discussing a different condition from that under study.

Healthcare institutions&#x27; websites have the responsibility to ensure that the private medical records of their online visitors are secure from being marketed and monetized into the hands of drug companies, occupation records, and insurance companies. The delivery of diagnosis online leads patients to believe that doctors in some parts of the country are at the direct service of drug companies, finding diagnosis as convenient as what drug still has patent rights on it. Physicians and drug companies are found to be competing for top ten search engine ranks to lower costs of selling these drugs with little to no patient involvement.

With the expansion of internet healthcare platforms, online practitioner legitimacy and privacy accountability face unique challenges such as e-paparazzi, online information brokers, industrial spies, unlicensed information providers that work outside of traditional medical codes for profit. The American Medical Association (AMA) states that medical websites have the responsibility to ensure the health care privacy of online visitors and protect patient records from being marketed and monetized into the hands of insurance companies, employers, and marketers. [40] With the rapid unification of healthcare, business practices, computer science and e-commerce to create these online diagnostic websites, efforts to maintain health care system&#x27;s ethical confidentiality standard need to keep up as well. Over the next few years, the Department of Health and Human Services has stated that they will be working towards lawfully protecting the online privacy and digital transfers of patient Electronic Medical Records (EMR) under The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). [41] Looking forward, strong governance and accountability mechanisms will need to be considered with respect to digital health ecosystems, including potential metaverse healthcare platforms, to ensure the highest ethical standards are upheld relating to medical confidentiality and patient data.

==Control, resolution and enforcement==
In the UK, medical ethics forms part of the training of physicians and surgeons and disregard for ethical principles can result in doctors barred from medical practice after a decision by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service.

To ensure that appropriate ethical values are being applied within hospitals, effective hospital accreditation requires that ethical considerations are taken into account, for example with respect to physician integrity, conflict of interest, research ethics and organ transplantation ethics.

===Guidelines===
There is much documentation of the history and necessity of the Declaration of Helsinki. The first code of conduct for research including medical ethics was the Nuremberg Code. This document had large ties to Nazi war crimes, as it was introduced in 1997, so it didn&#x27;t make much of a difference in terms of regulating practice. This issue called for the creation of the Declaration. There are some stark differences between the Nuremberg Code and the Declaration of Helsinki, including the way it is written. Nuremberg was written in a very concise manner, with a simple explanation. The Declaration of Helsinki is written with a thorough explanation in mind and including many specific commentaries.

In the United Kingdom, General Medical Council provides clear overall modern guidance in the form of its &#x27;Good Medical Practice&#x27; statement. Other organizations, such as the Medical Protection Society and a number of university departments, are often consulted by British doctors regarding issues relating to ethics.

===Ethics committees===
Often, simple communication is not enough to resolve a conflict, and a hospital ethics committee must convene to decide a complex matter.

These bodies are composed primarily of healthcare professionals, but may also include philosophers, lay people, and clergy – indeed, in many parts of the world their presence is considered mandatory in order to provide balance.

With respect to the expected composition of such bodies in the US, Europe and Australia, the following applies.

The assignment of philosophers or religious clerics will reflect the importance attached by the society to the basic values involved. An example from Sweden with Torbjörn Tännsjö on a couple of such committees indicates secular trends gaining influence.

==Cultural concerns==
Cultural differences can create difficult medical ethics problems. Some cultures have spiritual or magical theories about the origins and cause of disease, for example, and reconciling these beliefs with the tenets of Western medicine can be very difficult. As different cultures continue to intermingle and more cultures live alongside each other, the healthcare system, which tends to deal with important life events such as birth, death and suffering, increasingly experiences difficult dilemmas that can sometimes lead to cultural clashes and conflict. Efforts to respond in a culturally sensitive manner go hand in hand with a need to distinguish limits to cultural tolerance.

=== Culture and language ===
As more people from different cultural and religious backgrounds move to other countries, among these, the United States, it is becoming increasingly important to be culturally sensitive to all communities in order to provide the best health care for all people. Lack of cultural knowledge can lead to misunderstandings and even inadequate care, which can lead to ethical problems. A common complaint patients have is feeling like they are not being heard, or perhaps, understood. Preventing escalating conflict can be accomplished by seeking interpreters, noticing body language and tone of both yourself and the patient as well as attempting to understand the patient&#x27;s perspective in order to reach an acceptable option.

Some believe most medical practitioners in the future will have to be or greatly benefit from being bilingual. In addition to knowing the language, truly understanding culture is best for optimal care. Recently, a practice called &#x27;narrative medicine&#x27; has gained some interest as it has a potential for improving patient-physician communication and understanding of patient&#x27;s perspective. Interpreting a patient&#x27;s stories or day-to-day activities as opposed to standardizing and collecting patient data may help in acquiring a better sense of what each patient needs, individually, with respect to their illness. Without this background information, many physicians are unable to properly understand the cultural differences that may set two different patients apart, and thus, may diagnose or recommend treatments that are culturally insensitive or inappropriate. In short, patient narrative has the potential for uncovering patient information and preferences that may otherwise be overlooked.

=== Medical humanitarianism ===
In order to address the underserved, uneducated communities in need of nutrition, housing, and healthcare disparities seen in much of the world today, some argue that we must fall back on ethical values in order to create a foundation to move towards a reasonable understanding, which encourages commitment and motivation to improve factors causing premature death as a goal in a global community. Such factors – such as poverty, environment and education – are said to be out of national or individual control and so this commitment is by default a social and communal responsibility placed on global communities that are able to aid others in need. This is based on the framework of &#x27;provincial globalism,&#x27; which seeks a world in which all people have the capability to be healthy.

One concern regarding the intersection of medical ethics and humanitarian medical aid is how medical assistance can be as harmful as it is helpful to the community being served. One such example being how political forces may control how foreign humanitarian aid can be utilized in the region it is meant to be provided in. This would be congruous in situations where political strife could lead such aid being used in favor of one group over another. Another example of how foreign humanitarian aid can be misused in its intended community includes the possibility of dissonance forming between a foreign humanitarian aid group and the community being served. Examples of this could include the relationships being viewed between aid workers, style of dress, or the lack of education regarding local culture and customs.

Humanitarian practices in areas lacking optimum care can also pause other interesting and difficult ethical dilemmas in terms of beneficence and non-maleficence. Humanitarian practices are based upon providing better medical equipment and care for communities whose country does not provide adequate healthcare. The issues with providing healthcare to communities in need may sometimes be religious or cultural backgrounds keeping people from performing certain procedures or taking certain drugs. On the other hand, wanting certain procedures done in a specific manner due to religious or cultural belief systems may also occur. The ethical dilemma stems from differences in culture between communities helping those with medical disparities and the societies receiving aid. Women&#x27;s rights, informed consent and education about health become controversial, as some treatments needed are against societal law, while some cultural traditions involve procedures against humanitarian efforts. Examples of this are female genital mutilation (FGM), aiding in reinfibulation, providing sterile equipment in order to perform procedures such as FGM, as well as informing patients of their HIV positive testing. The latter is controversial because certain communities have in the past outcast or killed HIV positive individuals.

=== Healthcare reform and lifestyle ===
Leading causes of death in the United States and around the world are highly related to behavioral consequences over genetic or environmental factors. This leads some to believe true healthcare reform begins with cultural reform, habit and overall lifestyle. Lifestyle, then, becomes the cause of many illnesses and the illnesses themselves are the result or side-effect of a larger problem. Some people believe this to be true and think that cultural change is needed in order for developing societies to cope and dodge the negative effects of drugs, food and conventional modes of transportation available to them. In 1990, tobacco use, diet, and exercise alone accounted for close to 80 percent of all premature deaths and continue to lead in this way through the 21st century. Heart disease, stroke, dementia, and diabetes are some of the diseases that may be affected by habit-forming patterns throughout our life. Some believe that medical lifestyle counseling and building healthy habits around our daily lives is one way to tackle health care reform.

=== Other cultures and healthcare ===

==== Buddhist medicine ====
Buddhist ethics and medicine are based on religious teachings of compassion and understanding of suffering and cause and effect and the idea that there is no beginning or end to life, but that instead there are only rebirths in an endless cycle. In this way, death is merely a phase in an indefinitely lengthy process of life, not an end. However, Buddhist teachings support living one&#x27;s life to the fullest so that through all the suffering which encompasses a large part of what is life, there are no regrets. Buddhism accepts suffering as an inescapable experience, but values happiness and thus values life. Because of this, suicide and euthanasia, are prohibited. However, attempts to rid oneself of any physical or mental pain and suffering are seen as good acts. On the other hand, sedatives and drugs are thought to impair consciousness and awareness in the dying process, which is believed to be of great importance, as it is thought that one&#x27;s dying consciousness remains and affects new life. Because of this, analgesics must not be part of the dying process, in order for the dying person to be present entirely and pass on their consciousness wholesomely. This can pose significant conflicts during end of life care in Western medical practice.
==== Chinese medicine ====
Sun Simiao 孫思邈 is known as the founder of medical ethics in China. An illustrious author and practitioner in the Tang dynasty (7th century), he composed the famous medical &quot;oath&quot; in his treatise &quot;On the Sublime Sincerity of the Great Doctor 論大醫精誠,&quot; which is used in many Western acupuncture schools today as the equivalent of the Hippocratic oath. In traditional Chinese philosophy, human life is believed to be connected to nature, which is thought of as the foundation and encompassing force sustaining all of life&#x27;s phases. Passing and coming of the seasons, life, birth and death are perceived as a cyclic and perpetual occurrences that are believed to be regulated by the principles of &quot;yin&quot; and &quot;yang&quot;&quot;.&quot; When one dies, the life-giving material force referred to as &quot;ch&#x27;i&quot;, encompassing both body and spirit, rejoins the material force of the universe and cycles on with respect to the rhythms set forth by &quot;yin&quot; and &quot;yang.&quot;

Because many Chinese people believe that circulation of both physical and &#x27;psychic energy&#x27; is important to stay healthy, procedures which require surgery, as well as donations and transplantations of organs, are seen as a loss of &quot;ch&#x27;i&quot;, resulting in the loss of someone&#x27;s vital energy supporting their consciousness and purpose in their lives. Furthermore, a person is never seen as a single unit but rather as a source of relationship, interconnected in a social web. Thus, it is believed that what makes a human one of us is relatedness and communication and family is seen as the basic unit of a community. This can greatly affect the way medical decisions are made among family members, as diagnoses are not always expected to be announced to the dying or sick, the elderly are expected to be cared for and represented by their children and physicians are expected to act in a paternalistic way. In short, informed consent as well as patient privacy can be difficult to enforce when dealing with Confucian families.

Furthermore, some Chinese people may be inclined to continue futile treatment in order to extend life and allow for fulfillment of the practice of benevolence and humanity. In contrast, patients with strong Daoist beliefs may see death as an obstacle and dying as a reunion with nature that should be accepted, and are therefore less likely to ask for treatment of an irreversible condition.

==== Islamic culture and medicine ====
Some believe Islamic medical ethics and framework remain poorly understood by many working in healthcare. It is important to recognize that for people of Islamic faith, Islam envelops and affects all aspects of life, not just medicine. Because many believe it is faith and a supreme deity that hold the cure to illness, it is common that the physician is viewed merely as help or intermediary player during the process of healing or medical care.

In addition to Chinese culture&#x27;s emphasis on family as the basic unit of a community intertwined and forming a greater social construct, Islamic traditional medicine also places importance on the values of family and the well-being of a community. Many Islamic communities uphold paternalism as an acceptable part of medical care. However, autonomy and self-rule is also valued and protected and, in Islamic medicine, it is particularly upheld in terms of providing and expecting privacy in the healthcare setting. An example of this is requesting same gender providers in order to retain modesty. Overall, Beauchamp&#x27;s principles of beneficence, non-maleficence and justice are promoted and upheld in the medical sphere with as much importance as in Western culture. In contrast, autonomy is important but more nuanced. Furthermore, Islam also brings forth the principles of jurisprudence, Islamic law and legal maxims, which also allow for Islam to adapt to an ever-changing medical ethics framework.

==Conflicts of interest==

Physicians should not allow a conflict of interest to influence medical judgment. In some cases, conflicts are hard to avoid, and doctors have a responsibility to avoid entering such situations. Research has shown that conflicts of interests are very common among both academic physicians and physicians in practice.

===Referral===
Doctors who receive income from referring patients for medical tests have been shown to refer more patients for medical tests. This practice is proscribed by the American College of Physicians Ethics Manual. Fee splitting and the payments of commissions to attract referrals of patients is considered unethical and unacceptable in most parts of the world.

===Vendor relationships===

Studies show that doctors can be influenced by drug company inducements, including gifts and food. Industry-sponsored Continuing Medical Education (CME) programs influence prescribing patterns. Many patients surveyed in one study agreed that physician gifts from drug companies influence prescribing practices. A growing movement among physicians is attempting to diminish the influence of pharmaceutical industry marketing upon medical practice, as evidenced by Stanford University&#x27;s ban on drug company-sponsored lunches and gifts. Other academic institutions that have banned pharmaceutical industry-sponsored gifts and food include the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, University of Michigan, University of Pennsylvania, and Yale University.

===Treatment of family members===
The American Medical Association (AMA) states that &quot;Physicians generally should not treat themselves or members of their immediate family&quot;. This code seeks to protect patients and physicians because professional objectivity can be compromised when the physician is treating a loved one. Studies from multiple health organizations have illustrated that physician-family member relationships may cause an increase in diagnostic testing and costs. Many doctors still treat their family members. Doctors who do so must be vigilant not to create conflicts of interest or treat inappropriately. Physicians that treat family members need to be conscious of conflicting expectations and dilemmas when treating relatives, as established medical ethical principles may not be morally imperative when family members are confronted with serious illness.

===Sexual relationships===
Sexual relationships between doctors and patients can create ethical conflicts, since sexual consent may conflict with the fiduciary responsibility of the physician. Out of the many disciplines in current medicine, there are studies that have been conducted in order to ascertain the occurrence of Doctor-Patient sexual misconduct. Results from those studies appear to indicate that certain disciplines are more likely to be offenders than others. Psychiatrists and obstetrician-gynecologists, for example, are two disciplines noted for having a higher rate of sexual misconduct. The violation of ethical conduct between doctors and patients also has an association with the age and sex of doctor and patient. Male physicians aged 40–59 years have been found to be more likely to have been reported for sexual misconduct; women aged 20–39 have been found to make up a significant portion of reported victims of sexual misconduct. Doctors who enter into sexual relationships with patients face the threats of losing their medical license and prosecution. In the early 1990s, it was estimated that 2–9% of doctors had violated this rule. Sexual relationships between physicians and patients&#x27; relatives may also be prohibited in some jurisdictions, although this prohibition is highly controversial.

==Futility==

In some hospitals, medical futility is referred to as treatment that is unable to benefit the patient. An important part of practicing good medical ethics is by attempting to avoid futility by practicing non-maleficence. What should be done if there is no chance that a patient will survive or benefit from a potential treatment but the family members insist on advanced care? Previously, some articles defined futility as the patient having less than a one percent chance of surviving. Some of these cases are examined in court.

Advance directives include living wills and durable powers of attorney for health care. (&quot;See also do not resuscitate and cardiopulmonary resuscitation&quot;) In many cases, the &quot;expressed wishes&quot; of the patient are documented in these directives, and this provides a framework to guide family members and health care professionals in the decision-making process when the patient is incapacitated. Undocumented expressed wishes can also help guide decisions in the absence of advance directives, as in the Quinlan case in Missouri.

&quot;Substituted judgment&quot; is the concept that a family member can give consent for treatment if the patient is unable (or unwilling) to give consent themselves. The key question for the decision-making surrogate is not, &quot;What would you like to do?&quot;, but instead, &quot;What do you think the patient would want in this situation?&quot;.

Courts have supported family&#x27;s arbitrary definitions of futility to include simple biological survival, as in the Baby K case (in which the courts ordered a child born with only a brain stem instead of a complete brain to be kept on a ventilator based on the religious belief that all life must be preserved).

Baby Doe Law establishes state protection for a disabled child&#x27;s right to life, ensuring that this right is protected even over the wishes of parents or guardians in cases where they want to withhold treatment.

<text>Feijoa sellowiana also known as &quot;Acca sellowiana&quot; (O.Berg) Burret, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native mainly to the highlands of Colombia, southern Brazil and the hills of northeast Uruguay, but it can also be found in eastern Paraguay and northern Argentina. It is known as quirina (lusified from &quot;kanê kriyne&quot; by the indigenous Kaingang of southern Brazil) or more commercially as feijoa.

The Colombian feijoa (Acca sellowiana), a fruit-bearing shrub of the Myrtaceae family. In Colombia, the fruit is particularly associated with the Quindío and Boyacá regions, where it thrives in the Andean highlands. It has been cultivated for centuries by the inhabitants of Tibasosa, Boyacá, considered descendants of the Chibchas,Muiscas, and known for their longevity. The town of Tibasosa is renowned as the &quot;Feijoa Capital of Colombia&quot;, hosting the annual Feijoa Festival (Festival de la Feijoa) to celebrate the fruit’s cultural and economic significance. The Tibasosa feijoa variant is prized for its high pulp content and aromatic properties, making it popular for consumption in juices, desserts, jams, and even artisanal liquors. Due to its nutritional value, rich antioxidants content and potential medicinal properties, Colombian feijoa has garnered increasing attention for both local culinary use and international agricultural research.

They are also common in gardens of New Zealand. It is widely cultivated as an ornamental tree and for its fruit. It is an evergreen shrub or small tree, in height. The oblong leaves are about two inches (five cm) long, dark green on the upper side and white underneath. The flowers have five whitish petals which are puffy, possibly filled with some gas. There are about 25 dark red stamens projecting from the center.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Feijoa sellowiana&quot; Berg is from the genus which the German botanist, Ernst Berger, named after João da Silva Feijó, a Portuguese naturalist, and the specific name honors Friedrich Sellow, a German who first collected specimens of &quot;Feijoa&quot; in southern Brazil.

Other common English names in various countries include pineapple guava, fig guava and guavasteen, although it is not a true guava.

== Fruit ==
The fruit matures in autumn and the skin is green. Its shape is roughly that of a prolate spheroid, and it is about the size of a chicken egg. It is sweet, slightly tart, with an aromatic bouquet reminiscent of tropical fruits such as passion fruit, cherry guava, or pineapple. The flesh is juicy and is divided into a clear, gelatinous seed pulp and a firmer, slightly granular, opaque flesh nearer the skin. The fruit falls to the ground when ripe and at its fullest flavour, but it may be picked from the tree prior to falling to prevent bruising.

The fruit pulp resembles the closely related guava, having a gritty texture. The feijoa pulp is used in some natural cosmetic products as an exfoliant. Feijoa fruit has a distinctive, potent smell that resembles that of a fine perfume. The aroma is due to methyl benzoate and related compounds in the fruit.

== Growing conditions ==
In Brazil, it is naturally found around &quot;Araucaria angustifolia&quot; forests at altitudes more than 900 metres. The plant is a warm-temperate, subtropical plant that also will grow in the tropics, but requires at least 50 hours of winter chilling to fruit, and is frost-tolerant. When grown from seed, feijoas are noted for slow growth during their first year or two, and young plants, though cold tolerant, can be sensitive to high wind.

In the Northern Hemisphere, the species has been cultivated in the United Kingdom and as far north as western Scotland, but under such conditions it does not fruit every year, as winter temperatures below approximately kill the flower buds. Summer temperatures above may also have an adverse effect upon fruit set. Feijoas are somewhat tolerant of drought and salt in soils, though fruit production can be adversely affected. Tolerant to partial shade, regular watering is essential while the fruit is maturing.

== Cultivation ==

The main cultivation areas are not located in the original region of the feijoa; they are found in New Zealand, the United States (California), and Colombia, among other countries. Some cultivars of &quot;F. sellowiana&quot;, widely distributed internationally, derive from a small number of introductions of “Uruguayan type” plants. In 1890, Professor Edouard André introduced a specimen or a few specimens of the species from Uruguay to France, which were the origin of the seedlings introduced in California, and later reached New Zealand. Subsequently, Colombia introduced materials from various parts of the world.

Some grafted cultivars of feijoa are self-fertile. Most are not and require a pollinator. Seedlings may or may not be of usable quality; and may or may not be self-fertile. Feijoas will mature into a sprawly shrub but can be kept successfully as a large container plant, though accommodations will need to be made for the width of the plants, and the need to encourage new growth for fruit production.

Feijoas are occasionally found as landscape plants in Texas, Florida, California, and the maritime Pacific Northwest. They can succeed in greenhouses in temperate parts of the United States; and have been grown in-ground as fruiting trees on the United States east coast in coastal Georgia and South Carolina as well as in California. Other regions of the United States such as the southernmost Appalachian Mountains, and the immediate coastal region from North Carolina to Delaware would warrant further investigation.
The fruit has been widely grown in New Zealand since the 1920s, and it has become a popular garden tree. It is commonly available in season from March to June. In New Zealand, the pollinators of this plant are bees, bumblebees, and medium-sized birds. The silvereye is a pollinator in the cooler parts of the South Island; the blackbird and the Indian myna, which feeds on the sweet, fleshy flower petals, are pollinators further north. In some areas where the species has been introduced, however, the trees have been unproductive due to lack of pollinators. The shrub has very few insect pests, although guava moth is a problem in Northland, New Zealand.

In the South Caucasus, feijoa has been cultivated in the southern coastal region of Azerbaijan since 1928; cultivation in neighboring Georgia has gradually increased to about in 1986.

== Sale and shipping ==

Ripe fruit is prone to bruising; difficulty maintaining the fruit in good condition for any length of time, along with the short period of optimum ripeness and full flavor, probably explains why feijoas are not exported frequently, and are typically sold close to where they are grown. However, intercontinental shipping of feijoa by sea or air has been successful.

Because of the relatively short shelf life, storekeepers need to be careful to replace older fruit regularly to ensure high quality. In some countries, they also may be purchased at roadside stalls, often at a lower price.

Feijoas may be cool-stored for approximately a month and still have a few days of shelf life at optimum eating maturity. They also may be frozen for up to one year without a loss in quality.

== Consumption ==
=== Nutrition ===

 of raw feijoa provides 55 calories and is 13% carbohydrates, 9-16% sugars, and 1% each of fat and protein. The raw fruit is a rich source of vitamin C, providing 40% of the Daily Value, but supplies no other micronutrients in significant amount.

=== Food uses ===

Although the skin is edible, the fruit usually is eaten by cutting it in half, then scooping out the pulp with a spoon. The fruit has a juicy, sweet seed pulp and slightly gritty flesh nearer the skin. The flower petals are edible. The most common uses are eating raw, desserts such as sorbet, sweet pies, crumbles, or in salads. They are regularly consumed by birds.

<doc id="237253" wikidata="Q153753" url="?curid=237253" title="Albert Bandura">
<text>Albert Bandura (4 December 1925 – 26 July 2021) was a Canadian-American psychologist and professor of social science in psychology at Stanford University, who contributed to the fields of education and to the fields of psychology, e.g. social cognitive theory, therapy, and personality psychology, and influenced the transition between behaviorism and cognitive psychology. Bandura also is known as the originator of the social learning theory, the social cognitive theory, and the theoretical construct of self-efficacy, and was responsible for the theoretically influential Bobo doll experiment (1961), which demonstrated the conceptual validity of observational learning, wherein children would watch and observe an adult beat a doll, and, having learned through observation, the children then beat a Bobo doll. 

A 2002 survey ranked Bandura as the fourth most frequently cited psychologist of all time, behind B. F. Skinner, Sigmund Freud, and Jean Piaget. During his lifetime, Bandura was widely described as the greatest living psychologist, and as one of the most influential psychologists of all time.

==Early life==
Bandura was born in Mundare, Alberta, an open town of roughly four hundred inhabitants, as the youngest child, in a family of six. The limitations of education in a remote town such as this caused Bandura to become independent and self-motivated in terms of learning, and these primarily developed traits proved very helpful in his lengthy career. Bandura was of Polish and Ukrainian descent; his father was from Kraków, Poland, whilst his mother was from Ukraine.

Bandura&#x27;s parents were a key influence in encouraging him to seek ventures out of the small hamlet they resided in. The summer after finishing high school, Bandura worked in the Yukon to protect the Alaska Highway against sinking. Bandura later credited his work in the northern tundra as the origin of his interest in human psychopathology. It was in this experience in the Yukon, where he was exposed to a subculture of drinking and gambling, which helped broaden his perspective and scope of views on life.

Bandura arrived in the US in 1949 and was naturalized in 1956. He married Virginia Varns (1921–2011) in 1952, and they raised two daughters, Carol and Mary.

== Education and academic career ==
Bandura took psychology courses in college and became passionate about the subject. Bandura graduated in three years, in 1949, with a B.A. from the University of British Columbia, winning the Bolocan Award in psychology, and then moved to the then-epicenter of psychology, the University of Iowa, from where he obtained his M.A. in 1951 and Ph.D in clinical psychology in 1952. Arthur Benton was his academic adviser at Iowa, giving Bandura a direct academic descent from William James, while Clark Hull and Kenneth Spence were influential collaborators. During his Iowa years, Bandura came to support a style of psychology that sought to investigate psychological phenomena through repeatable, experimental testing. His inclusion of such mental phenomena as imagery and representation, and his concept of reciprocal determinism, which postulated a relationship of mutual influence between an agent and its environment, marked a radical departure from the dominant behaviorism of the time. Bandura&#x27;s expanded array of conceptual tools allowed for more potent modeling of such phenomena as observational learning and self-regulation, and provided psychologists with a practical way in which to theorize about mental processes, in opposition to the mentalistic constructs of psychoanalysis and personality psychology.

=== Post-doctoral work ===

Upon graduation, he completed his postdoctoral internship at the Wichita Guidance Center. The following year, 1953, he accepted a teaching position at Stanford University, which he held until becoming professor emeritus in 2010. In 1974, he was elected president of the American Psychological Association (APA), the world&#x27;s largest association of psychologists. Bandura would later state the only reason he agreed to be in the running for the APA election was because he wanted his 15 minutes of fame without any intentions of being elected. He also worked as a sports coach.

== Research ==
Bandura was initially influenced by Robert Sears&#x27; work on familial antecedents of social behavior and identificatory learning and gave up his research of the psychoanalytic theory. He directed his initial research to the role of social modeling in human motivation, thought, and action. In collaboration with Richard Walters, his first doctoral student, he engaged in studies of social learning and aggression. Their joint efforts illustrated the critical role of modeling in human behavior and led to a program of research into the determinants and mechanisms of observational learning.

=== Social learning theory ===

The initial phase of Bandura&#x27;s research analyzed the foundations of human learning, and the willingness of children and adults to imitate behavior they observed in other people, in particular, the emotion of &quot;aggression&quot;. The research indicated that models are an important means for learning new behaviors and for achieving behavioral change in an institutional setting. Social learning theory posits three regulatory systems that control human behavior. First, the antecedent inducements greatly influence the time and response of behavior. The stimulus that occurs &quot;before&quot; the behavioral response must be appropriate in relation to the social context and the performers of the behavior. Second, that response and feedback influences have an important function. Following a response to a stimulus, the reinforcements, either by experience or by observation, will determine future occurrences of the behavior. Third, that cognitive functions are important in social learning, e.g. for aggressive behavior to occur, some people are readily angered by the sight or the thought of persons with whom they had hostile encounters, and that aggression-inducing memory is learned.

Social learning theory became one of the theoretical frameworks for Entertainment-Education, a method of creating socially beneficial entertainment pioneered by Miguel Sabido. Bandura and Sabido went on to forge a close relationship and further refine the theory and practice.

His research with Walters led to his first book, &quot;Adolescent Aggression,&quot; in 1959, followed by &quot;Social Learning and Personality Development&quot; in 1963, and in 1973, &quot;Aggression: A Social Learning Analysis&quot;. During a period dominated by behaviorism in the mold of B.F. Skinner, Bandura believed the sole behavioral modifiers of reward and punishment in classical and operant conditioning were inadequate as a framework, and that many human behaviors were learned from other humans. Bandura began to analyze the means of treating unduly aggressive children by identifying sources of violence in their lives. Initial research in the area had begun in the 1940s under Neal Miller and John Dollard; his continued work in this line eventually culminated in the Bobo doll experiment, which led to his 1977 treatise, &quot;Social Learning Theory&quot;. Many of his innovations came from his focus on empirical investigation and reproducible investigation, contrary to Sigmund Freud&#x27;s popular theories of psychoanalysis. In 1974, Stanford University awarded him an endowed chair and he became David Starr Jordan Professor of Social Science in Psychology.

In 1961, Bandura conducted a controversial experiment known as the Bobo doll experiment, designed to show that similar behaviors were learned by individuals shaping their own behavior after the actions of models. The Bobo doll experiment emphasized how young individuals are influenced by the acts of adults. When the adults were praised for their aggressive behavior, the children were more likely to keep on hitting the doll. However, when the adults were punished, they consequently stopped hitting the doll as well. Bandura&#x27;s results from this experiment were widely credited with helping shift the focus in academic psychology from pure behaviorism to cognitive psychology.

===Social cognitive theory===

By the mid-1980s, Bandura&#x27;s research had taken a more holistic bent, and his analysis tended towards giving a more comprehensive overview of human cognition in the context of social learning. The theory he expanded from social learning theory soon became known as social cognitive theory.

The foundation of Albert Bandura&#x27;s social learning theory is the idea that people may learn by seeing and copying the observable behaviors of others. As an alternative to the earlier work of colleague psychologist B.F. Skinner, who was well-known for advocating the behaviorist theory, psychologists Albert Bandura and Robert Sears presented the social learning hypothesis.

==== Social foundations of thought and action ====

In 1986, Bandura published &quot;Social Foundations of Thought and Action: A Social Cognitive Theory&quot;, in which he re-conceptualized individuals as self-organizing, proactive, self-reflecting, and self-regulating, in opposition to the orthodox conception of humans as governed by external forces. He advanced concepts of triadic reciprocal causation, which determined the connections between human behavior, environmental factors, and personal factors such as cognitive, affective, and biological events, and of reciprocal determinism, governing the causal relations between such factors. Bandura&#x27;s emphasis on the capacity of agents to self-organize and self-regulate would eventually give rise to his later work on self-efficacy.

=== Self-efficacy ===
While investigating the processes by which modeling alleviates phobic disorders in snake-phobics, he found that self-efficacy beliefs (which the phobic individuals had in their own capabilities to alleviate their phobia) mediated changes in behavior and in fear-arousal. He launched a major program of research examining the influential role of self-referent thought in psychological functioning. Although he continued to explore and write on theoretical problems relating to myriad topics, from the late 1970s he devoted much attention to exploring the role of self-efficacy beliefs in human functioning.

In 1986 he published &quot;Social Foundations of Thought and Action: A Social Cognitive Theory&quot;, a book in which he offered a social cognitive theory of human functioning that accords a central role to cognitive, vicarious, self-regulatory and self-reflective processes in human adaptation and change. This theory has its roots in an agentic perspective that views people as self-organizing, proactive, self-reflecting and self-regulating, not just as reactive organisms shaped by environmental forces or driven by inner impulses. His book, &quot;Self-efficacy: The exercise of control&quot; was published in 1997.

== Educational application ==

Bandura&#x27;s social cognitive theories have been applied to education as well, mainly focusing on self-efficacy, self-regulation, observational learning, and reciprocal determinism. Bandura&#x27;s research showed that high perceived self-efficacy led teachers and students to set higher goals, and it increased the likelihood that they would dedicate themselves to those goals. In an educational setting self-efficacy refers to a student or teacher&#x27;s confidence to participate in certain actions that will help them achieve distinct goals.

==Death==
Bandura died at his home in Stanford on July 26, 2021, from congestive heart failure, at the age of 95.

==Awards==

Bandura received more than sixteen honorary degrees, including those from the University of British Columbia, the University of Ottawa, Alfred University, the University of Rome, the University of Lethbridge, the University of Salamanca in Spain, Indiana University, the University of New Brunswick, Penn State University, Leiden University, Freie Universität Berlin, the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, Universitat Jaume I in Spain, the University of Athens, the University of Alberta, and the University of Catania.

He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1980. He received the Award for Distinguished Scientific Contributions from the American Psychological Association in 1980 for pioneering the research in the field of self-regulated learning. In 1999 he received the Thorndike Award for Distinguished Contributions of Psychology to Education from the American Psychological Association, and in 2001, he received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Association for the Advancement of Behavior Therapy. He was the recipient of the Outstanding Lifetime Contribution to Psychology Award from the American Psychological Association and the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Western Psychological Association, the James McKeen Cattell Award from the American Psychological Society, and the Gold Medal Award for Distinguished Lifetime Contribution to Psychological Science from the American Psychological Foundation. In 2008, he received the University of Louisville Grawemeyer Award for contributions to psychology.

In 2014, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada &quot;for his foundational contributions to social psychology, notably for uncovering the influence of observation on human learning and aggression&quot;. In 2016, he was awarded the National Medal of Science by president Barack Obama.

<doc id="237254" wikidata="Q71004" url="?curid=237254" title="Emile Berliner">
<text>Emile Berliner (May 20, 1851 – August 3, 1929) originally Emil Berliner, was a German-American inventor. He is best known for inventing the lateral-cut flat disc record (called a &quot;gramophone record&quot; in British and American English) used with a gramophone. He founded the United States Gramophone Company in 1894.

==Early life ==
Berliner was born in Hanover, Germany, in 1851 into a Jewish merchant family. He completed an apprenticeship to become a merchant, as was family tradition. While his real hobby was invention, he worked as an accountant to make ends meet. To avoid being drafted in the Franco-Prussian War, Berliner migrated to the United States of America in 1870 with a friend of his father&#x27;s, in whose shop he worked in Washington, D.C. He moved to New York and, living off temporary work such a paper route and cleaning bottles, he studied physics at night at the Cooper Union Institute.

==Career==
After some time working in a livery stable, Berliner became interested in the new audio technology of the telephone and phonograph. He invented an improved telephone transmitter, one of the first types of microphones. The patent was acquired by the Bell Telephone Company (see &quot;The Telephone Cases&quot;), but contested, in a long legal battle, by Thomas Edison. On February 27, 1901, the United States Court of Appeals would declare Berliner&#x27;s patent void and awarded Edison full rights to the invention. &quot;Edison preceded Berliner in the transmission of speech,&quot; the court would write. &quot;The use of carbon in a transmitter is, beyond controversy, the invention of Edison&quot;. 

Berliner moved to Boston in 1877, where he became a United States citizen four years later. He worked for Bell Telephone until 1883, when he returned to Washington and established himself as a private researcher. 

=== Rotary engine and helicopters ===
Berliner also developed a rotary engine and an early version of the helicopter. According to a July 1, 1909, report in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, a helicopter built by Berliner and J. Newton Williams of Derby, Connecticut, had Williams &quot;from the ground on three occasions&quot; at Berliner&#x27;s laboratory in the Brightwood neighborhood of Washington, D.C.

Between 1907 and 1926, Berliner worked on technologies for vertical flight, including a lightweight rotary engine. Berliner obtained automobile engines from the Adams Company in Dubuque, Iowa, whose Adams-Farwell automobile used air-cooled three- or five-cylinder rotary engines developed in-house by Fay Oliver Farwell (1859–1935). Berliner, his assistant R.S. Moore, and Farwell developed a 36-hp rotary engine for use in helicopters, an innovation on the heavier inline engines then in use. 

In 1909, Berliner founded the Gyro Motor Company in Washington, D.C. The company&#x27;s principals included Berliner, president; Moore, designer and engineer; and Joseph Sanders (1877–1944), inventor, engineer, and manufacturer. The manager of the company was Spencer Heath (1876–1963), a mechanical engineer who was connected with the American Propeller Manufacturing Company, a manufacturer of aeronautical related mechanisms and products in Baltimore, Maryland. By 1910, Berliner was experimenting with the use of a vertically mounted tail rotor to counteract torque on his single-main-rotor design, a configuration that led to practical helicopters of the 1940s. The building used for these operations exists at 774 Girard Street NW, Washington, D.C., where its principal facade is in the Fairmont-Girard alleyway. On June 16, 1922, Berliner and his son, Henry, demonstrated a helicopter for the United States Army. 

Henry became disillusioned with helicopters in 1925, and the company shut down. In 1926, Henry Berliner founded the Berliner Aircraft Company, which merged to become Berliner-Joyce Aircraft in 1929.

=== Other ===
Berliner&#x27;s other inventions include a new type of loom for mass-production of cloth and an acoustic tile.

Berliner, who suffered a nervous breakdown in 1914, also advocated for improvements in public health and sanitation. He also advocated for women&#x27;s equality and, in 1908, established a scholarship program, the Sarah Berliner Research Fellowship, in honor of his mother.

==Death==
On August 3, 1929, Berliner died of a heart attack at his home at the Wardman Park Hotel in Washington, D.C., at the age of 78. He is buried in Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington, D.C., alongside his wife and a son, Herbert Samuel Berliner.

<doc id="237274" wikidata="Q182015" url="?curid=237274" title="Thriller (genre)">
<text>Thriller is a genre of fiction with numerous, often overlapping, subgenres, including crime, horror, and detective fiction. Thrillers are characterized and defined by the moods they elicit, giving their audiences heightened feelings of suspense, excitement, surprise, anticipation and anxiety. This genre is well suited to film and television.

A thriller generally keeps its audience on the &quot;edge of their seats&quot; as the plot builds towards a climax. The cover-up of important information is a common element. Literary devices such as red herrings, plot twists, unreliable narrators, and cliffhangers are used extensively. A thriller is often a villain-driven plot, whereby they present obstacles that the protagonist or hero must overcome.

Roots of the genre date back hundreds of years, but it began to develop as a distinct style in the 1800s and early 1900s with novels like &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; (1848) and &quot;The Thirty-Nine Steps&quot; (1915). The films of Alfred Hitchcock are critical in the development of the thriller film during the mid-20th century. Some popular 21st-century mainstream examples include: &quot;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&quot;, &quot;Gone Girl&quot;, &quot;The Girl on the Train&quot;, &quot;The Woman in the Window&quot;, and the British television series &quot;Utopia&quot;.

==Characteristics==
Writer Vladimir Nabokov, in his lectures at Cornell University, said: 
In an Anglo-Saxon thriller, the villain is generally punished, and the strong silent man generally wins the weak babbling girl, but there is no governmental law in Western countries to ban a story that does not comply with a fond tradition, so that we always hope that the wicked but romantic fellow will escape scot-free and the good but dull chap will be finally snubbed by the moody heroine.

Thrillers may be defined by the primary mood that they elicit: suspenseful excitement. In short, if it &quot;thrills&quot;, it is a thriller. As the introduction to a major anthology says:

Suspense is a crucial characteristic of the thriller genre. It gives the viewer a feeling of pleasurable fascination and excitement mixed with apprehension, anticipation, and tension. These develop from unpredictable, mysterious, and rousing events during the narrative, which makes the viewer or reader think about the outcome of certain actions. Suspense builds in order to make those final moments, no matter how short, the most memorable. The suspense in a story keeps the person hooked to reading or watching more until the climax is reached.

In terms of narrative expectations, it may be contrasted with curiosity and surprise. The objective is to deliver a story with sustained tension, surprise, and a constant sense of impending doom. As described by film director Alfred Hitchcock, an audience experiences suspense when they expect something bad to happen and have (or believe they have) a superior perspective on events in the drama&#x27;s hierarchy of knowledge, yet they are powerless to intervene to prevent it from happening.

Suspense in thrillers is often intertwined with hope and anxiety, which are treated as two emotions aroused in anticipation of the conclusion - the hope that things will turn out all right for the appropriate characters in the story, and the fear that they may not. The second type of suspense is the &quot;...anticipation wherein we either know or else are fairly certain about what is going to happen but are still aroused in anticipation of its actual occurrence.&quot;

According to Greek philosopher Aristotle in his book &quot;Poetics&quot;, suspense is an important building block of literature, and this is an important convention in the thriller genre.

Thriller music has been shown to create distrust and ominous uncertainty between the viewer of a film and the character on screen at the time when the music is playing.

===Themes and characters===
Common methods and themes in crime and action thrillers are ransoms, captivities, heists, revenge, and kidnappings. Common in mystery thrillers are investigations and the whodunit technique. Common elements in dramatic and psychological thrillers include plot twists, psychology, obsession and mind games. Common elements of science-fiction thrillers are killing robots, machines or aliens, mad scientists and experiments. Common in horror thrillers are serial killers, stalking, deathtraps and horror-of-personality. Elements such as fringe theories, false accusations and paranoia are common in paranoid thrillers. Threats to entire countries, spies, espionage, conspiracies, assassins and electronic surveillance are common in spy thrillers.

Characters may include criminals, stalkers, assassins, innocent victims (often on the run), menaced women, psychotic individuals, spree killers, sociopaths, agents, terrorists, police, escaped convicts, private eyes, people involved in twisted relationships, world-weary men and women, psycho-fiends, and more. The themes frequently include terrorism, political conspiracy, pursuit, or romantic triangles leading to murder. Plots of thrillers involve characters which come into conflict with each other or with outside forces.

The protagonist of these films is set against a problem. No matter what subgenre a thriller film falls into, it will emphasize the danger that the protagonist faces. The protagonists are frequently ordinary citizens unaccustomed to danger, although commonly in crime and action thrillers, they may also be &quot;hard men&quot; accustomed to danger such as police officers and detectives. While protagonists of thrillers have traditionally been men, women lead characters are increasingly common. In psychological thrillers, the protagonists are reliant on their mental resources, whether it be by battling wits with the antagonist or by battling for equilibrium in the character&#x27;s own mind. The suspense often comes from two or more characters preying upon one another&#x27;s minds, either by playing deceptive games with the other or by merely trying to demolish the other&#x27;s mental state.

===Story and setting===
An atmosphere of menace and sudden violence, such as crime and murder, characterize thrillers. The tension usually arises when the character(s) is placed in a dangerous situation, or a trap from which escaping seems impossible. Life is threatened, usually because the principal character is unsuspectingly or unknowingly involved in a dangerous or potentially deadly situation.

Hitchcock&#x27;s films often placed an innocent victim (an average, responsible person) into a strange, life-threatening or terrorizing situation, in a case of mistaken identity or wrongful accusation.

Thrillers take place mostly in ordinary suburbs and cities, although sometimes they may take place wholly or partly in exotic settings such as foreign cities, deserts, polar regions, or the high seas. These usually tough, resourceful, but essentially ordinary heroes are pitted against villains determined to destroy them, their country, or the stability of the Free World (especially if it is set during the Cold War). Often in a thriller movie, the protagonist is faced with what seem to be insurmountable problems in his mission, carried out against a ticking clock, the stakes are high and although resourceful, they face personal dilemmas along the way forcing them to make sacrifices for others.

==History in literature==
Ancient epic poems such as the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;, Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; and the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot; may have used similar narrative techniques to modern thrillers. &quot;The Three Apples&quot;, a tale in the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; (&quot;Arabian Nights&quot;), is a murder mystery with multiple plot twists and detective fiction elements. In this tale, a fisherman discovers a heavy, locked chest on the banks of the Tigris river and sells it to the Abbasid Caliph, Harun al-Rashid, who has it broken open - only to discover inside it the dismembered body of a young woman. Harun then orders his vizier, Ja&#x27;far ibn Yahya, to solve the crime and find the murderer within three days. This whodunit mystery has also been considered a detective story, though it lacks a sleuth.

&quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; (1844) is a swashbuckling revenge thriller about a man named Edmond Dantès who is betrayed by his friends and sent to languish in the notorious Château d&#x27;If. His only companion is an old man who teaches him everything from philosophy to mathematics to swordplay. Just before the old man dies, he reveals to Dantès the secret location of a great treasure. Shortly after, Dantès engineers a daring escape and uses the treasure to reinvent himself as the Count of Monte Cristo. Thirsting for vengeance, he sets out to punish those who destroyed his life.

The first recognizable modern thriller was Erskine Childers&#x27; &quot;The Riddle of the Sands&quot; (1903), in which two young Englishmen stumble upon a secret German armada preparing to invade their homeland.

&quot;The Thirty-Nine Steps&quot; (1915) is an early detective thriller by John Buchan, in which an innocent man becomes the prime suspect in a murder case and finds himself on the run from both the police and enemy spies.

Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;M&quot; (1931) is regarded as a groundbreaking psychological thriller, introducing innovative suspense-enhancing audiovisual techniques that have become standard and ubiquitous ever since.

&quot;Gilles&quot; (1936) is an early example of a political thriller, and in one of the book&#x27;s subplots the protagonist &quot;Gilles Gambier&quot; finds himself embroiled in an left-wing assassination plot against the Prime Minister. The plot falls apart due to the ineptness of the conspirators, and Gilles ends with the protaganist leaving to fight in the Spanish Civil War.

&quot;The Spy Who Came in from the Cold&quot; (1963) by John le Carré is set in the world of Cold War espionage and helped to usher in an era of thriller fiction based around professional spies and the battle of wits between rival spymasters.

== Television ==
There have been at least two television series called simply &quot;Thriller&quot;, one made in the US in the 1960s and one made in the UK in the 1970s. Although in no way linked, both series consisted of one-off dramas, each utilising the familiar motifs of the genre.

&quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; consists of suspenseful unrelated dramas depicting characters dealing with paranormal, futuristic, supernatural, or otherwise disturbing or unusual events. Characters who find themselves dealing with these strange, sometimes inexplicable happenings are said to have crossed over into &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. Each story typically features a moral and a surprise ending.

<doc id="237275" wikidata="Q862454" url="?curid=237275" title="Lantern">
<text>A lantern is a source of lighting, often portable. It typically features a protective enclosure for the light sourcehistorically usually a candle, a wick in oil, or a thermoluminescent mesh, and often a battery-powered light in modern timesto make it easier to carry and hang up, and make it more reliable outdoors or in drafty interiors. Lanterns may also be used for signaling, as torches, or as general light-sources outdoors.

==Uses==
The lantern enclosure was primarily used to prevent a burning candle or wick being extinguished from wind, rain or other causes. Some antique lanterns have only a metal grid, indicating their function was to protect the candle or wick during transportation and avoid the excess heat from the top to avoid unexpected fires.

Another important function was to reduce the risk of fire should a spark leap from the flame or the light be dropped. This was especially important below deck on ships: a fire on a wooden ship was a major catastrophe. Use of unguarded lights was taken so seriously that obligatory use of lanterns, rather than unprotected flames, below decks was written into one of the few known remaining examples of a pirate code, on pain of severe punishment.

Lanterns may also be used for signaling. In naval operations, ships used lights to communicate at least as far back as the Middle Ages; the use of a lantern that blinks code to transmit a message dates to the mid-1800s. In railroad operations, lanterns have multiple uses. Permanent lanterns on poles are used to signal trains about the operational status of the track ahead, sometimes with color gels in front of the light to signify stop, etc. Historically, a flagman at a level crossing used a lantern to stop cars and other vehicular traffic before a train arrived. Lanterns also provided a means to signal from train-to-train or from station-to-train.

A &quot;dark lantern&quot; was a candle lantern with a sliding shutter so that a space could be conveniently made dark without extinguishing the candle. For example, in the Sherlock Holmes story &quot;The Red-Headed League&quot;, the detective and police make their way down to a bank vault by lantern light but then put a &#x27;screen over that dark lantern&#x27; in order to wait in the dark for thieves to finish tunneling. This type of lantern could also preserve the light source for sudden use when needed.
Lanterns may be used in religious observances. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, lanterns are used in religious processions and liturgical entrances, usually coming before the processional cross. Lanterns are also used to transport the Holy Fire from the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Great Saturday during Holy Week.

Lanterns are used in many Asian festivals. During the Ghost Festival, lotus shaped lanterns are set afloat in rivers and seas to symbolically guide the lost souls of forgotten ancestors to the afterlife. During the Lantern Festival, the displaying of many lanterns is still a common sight on the 15th day of the first lunar month throughout China. During other Chinese festivities, kongming lanterns (sky lanterns) can be seen floating high into the air. However, some jurisdictions, such as in Canada, some states in the U.S., and parts of India, as well as some organizations, ban the use of sky lanterns because of concerns about fire and safety.

The term &quot;lantern&quot; can be used more generically to mean a light source, or the enclosure for a light source, even if it is not portable. Decorative lanterns exist in a wide range of designs. Some hang from buildings, such as street lights enclosed in glass panes. Others are placed on or just above the ground; low-light varieties can function as decoration or landscape lighting and can be a variety of colors and sizes. The housing for the top lamp and lens section of a lighthouse may be called a lantern.

==Etymology==

The word &quot;lantern&quot; comes via French from Latin meaning &quot;lamp, torch,&quot; possibly itself derived from Greek.

An alternate historical spelling was &quot;&quot;, possibly derived from the ancient use of animal horn to cover window apertures, but allow in light. A lanthorn might have been significantly larger and brighter than a lantern.

==Construction==

Lanterns were usually made from a metal frame with several sides (usually four, but up to eight) or round, commonly with a hook or a hoop of metal on top. Windows of some translucent material may be fitted in the sides; these are now usually glass or plastic but formerly were thin sheets of animal horn, or tinplate punched with holes or decorative patterns.

Paper lanterns are made in societies around the world.

A lantern generally contains a burning light source: a candle, liquid oil with a wick, or gas with a mantle. The ancient Chinese sometimes captured fireflies in transparent or semi-transparent containers and used them as (short-term) lanterns, and use of fireflies in transparent containers was also a widespread practice in ancient India; however, since these were short-term solutions, the use of fire torches was more prevalent.

Modern varieties often place an electric light in a decorative glass case.

==History==
In 1417, the Mayor of London ordered that all homes must hang lanterns outdoors after nightfall during the winter months. This marked the first organized public street lighting. 

Lanterns have been used functionally, for light rather than decoration, since antiquity. Some used a wick in oil, while others were essentially protected candle-holders. Before the development of glass sheets, animal horns were scraped thin and flattened to create a translucent window.

Beginning in the Middle Ages, middle eastern towns hired watchmen to patrol the streets at night, as a crime deterrent. Each watchman carried a lantern or oil lamp against the darkness. The practice continued up through at least the 18th century.

In March 1764 and twice in October 1764, George Allsopp, a British-born Canadian, was arrested in Quebec for violating an order to carry lanterns during the night. There was violence every time he was arrested and Allsopp would denounce the military. In October he prosecuted the soldiers involved in his arrests.

On April 18, 1775, Paul Revere&#x27;s midnight ride took place after two lanterns were held up in the Old North Church to signal to patriots in Charlestown that the British troops were crossing the Charles River to disarm the rebel colonial militias. The Battles of Lexington and Concord occurred the day after, on April 19, starting the American Revolution.

Public spaces became increasingly lit with lanterns in the 1500s, especially following the invention of lanterns with glass windows, which greatly improved the quantity of light. In 1588 the Parisian Parlement decreed that a torch be installed and lit at each intersection, and in 1594 the police changed this to lanterns. Beginning in 1667 during the reign of King Louis XIV, thousands of street lights were installed in Parisian streets and intersections. Under this system, streets were lit with lanterns suspended apart on a cord over the middle of the street at a height of ; as an English visitor described in 1698, &#x27;The streets are lit all winter and even during the full moon!&#x27; In London, a diarist wrote in 1712 that ‘All the way, quite through Hyde Park to the Queen&#x27;s Palace at Kensington, lanterns were placed for illuminating the roads on dark nights.’

==Modern lanterns==

===Fueled lanterns===

All fueled lanterns are somewhat hazardous owing to the danger of handling flammable and toxic fuel, danger of fire or burns from the high temperatures involved, and potential dangers from carbon monoxide poisoning if used in an enclosed environment.

Simple wick lanterns remain available. They are cheap and durable and usually can provide enough light for reading. They require periodic trimming of the wick and regular cleaning of soot from the inside of the glass chimney.

Mantle lanterns use a woven ceramic impregnated gas mantle to accept and re-radiate heat as visible light from a flame. The mantle does not burn (but the cloth matrix carrying the ceramic must be &quot;burned out&quot; with a match prior to its first use). When heated by the operating flame the mantle becomes incandescent and glows brightly. The heat may be provided by a gas, by kerosene, or by a pressurized liquid such as &quot;white gas&quot;, which is essentially naphtha. For protection from the high temperatures produced and to stabilize the airflow, a cylindrical glass shield called the globe or chimney is placed around the mantle.

Manually pressurized lanterns using white gas (also marketed as Coleman fuel or &quot;Camp Fuel&quot;) are manufactured by the Coleman Company in one and two-mantle models. Some models are dual fuel and can also use gasoline. These are being supplanted by a battery-powered fluorescent lamp and LED models, which are safer in the hands of young people and inside tents. Liquid fuel lanterns remain popular where the fuel is easily obtained and in common use.

Many portable mantle-type fuel lanterns now use fuel gases that become liquid when compressed, such as propane, either alone or combined with butane. Such lamps usually use a small disposable steel container to provide the fuel. The ability to refuel without liquid fuel handling increases safety. Additional fuel supplies for such lamps have an indefinite shelf life if the containers are protected from moisture (which can cause corrosion of the container) and excess heat.

===Electric lanterns===
Lanterns designed as permanently mounted electric lighting fixtures are used in interior, landscape, and civic lighting applications. Styles can evoke former eras, unify street furniture themes, or enhance aesthetic considerations. They are manufactured for use with various wired voltage supplies.

Various battery types are used in portable light sources. They are more convenient, safer, and produce less heat than combustion lights. Solar-powered lanterns have become popular in developing countries, where they provide a safer and cheaper alternative to kerosene lamps.

Lanterns utilizing LEDs are popular as they are more energy-efficient and rugged than other types, and prices of LEDs suitable for lighting have dropped.

Some rechargeable fluorescent lanterns may be plugged in at all times and may be set up to illuminate upon a power failure, a useful feature in some applications. During extensive power failures (or for remote use), supplemental recharging may be provided from an automobile&#x27;s 12-volt electrical system or from a modest solar-powered charger.

==In popular culture==

The derived term &quot;lantern jaw[ed]&quot; is used in two quite different still current ways, comparing faces with different types of lantern. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, it refers to &quot;long thin jaws, giving a hollow appearance to the cheek&quot;; this use was recorded in 1361, referring to a lantern with concave horn sides before glass was in use. Another meaning of &quot;lantern jaw&quot; compares a lantern with a jutting base – such as the 15th-century example above – to the face of a person with the extended chin of mandibular prognathism; this condition was also known as Habsburg jaw or Habsburg lip, as it was a hereditary feature of the House of Habsburg (see, for example, portraits of ).

&quot;Raise the Red Lantern&quot;, a 1991 Chinese film, prominently features lanterns as a motif.

&quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot;, a short story by Edgar Allan Poe, features the use of a dark lantern by the protagonist to shine a single ray of light on his victim&#x27;s eye.

<text>Bruce Almighty is a 2003 American fantasy comedy film directed by Tom Shadyac and written by Steve Koren, Mark O&#x27;Keefe and Steve Oedekerk. The film stars Jim Carrey as Bruce Nolan, a down-on-his-luck television reporter who complains to God (played by Morgan Freeman) that he is not doing his job correctly and is offered the chance to try being God himself for one week. It co-stars Jennifer Aniston, Philip Baker Hall and Catherine Bell. The film is Shadyac and Carrey&#x27;s third collaboration, after &quot;Ace Ventura: Pet Detective&quot; (1994) and &quot;Liar Liar&quot; (1997).

When released in American theaters on May 23, 2003, &quot;Bruce Almighty&quot; received mixed reviews from critics but was a box-office success and grossed $86.4 million in its opening weekend, a Memorial Day record at the time. The film surprised the industry&#x27;s pundits when it beat &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; the following weekend. It went on to gross $484 million worldwide, becoming the fifth-highest-grossing film of 2003.

&quot;Evan Almighty —&quot; a spin-off sequel focusing on Steve Carell&#x27;s character, with Shadyac and Oedekerk returning to direct and write, respectively, and Freeman also reprising his role — was released on June 22, 2007.

==Plot==

Bruce Nolan is a television field reporter for &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; on WKBW-TV in Buffalo, New York, but desires to be a news anchorman, succeeding the retiring Pete Fineman. When Bruce&#x27;s rival Evan Baxter is given the job, a vulgar on-camera outburst leads to Bruce&#x27;s dismissal from the station. After a series of misfortunes, Bruce complains to God that &quot;He&#x27;s the one that should be fired&quot;. Bruce receives a message on his pager, which takes him to an empty warehouse where he meets God. God offers to give Bruce his powers to prove that he is doing the job correctly. God tells Bruce that he cannot tell others he has God&#x27;s powers to avoid the media attention, nor can he use the powers to alter free will. Bruce is initially jubilant with the powers, using them for personal gains, such as regaining his previous job and impressing his girlfriend, Grace Connelly.

Bruce finds ways of using his powers around Buffalo to cause miraculous events to occur at otherwise mundane events that he covers, such as discovering Jimmy Hoffa&#x27;s body during a segment on police training, or causing a meteorite to harmlessly land near a cook-off, earning him the nickname &quot;Mr. Exclusive&quot;. Bruce then causes Evan to embarrass himself on-air, causing Evan to be fired in favor of Bruce as the new anchor. Bruce begins to hear voices in his head and re-encounters God, who explains the voices are prayers that Bruce must deal with. Bruce creates a computerized email-like system to receive the prayers and respond but finds that the influx is far too many for him to handle and sets the program to answer every prayer &quot;Yes&quot; automatically.

Bruce attends a party celebrating his promotion. When Grace arrives, she finds Bruce kissing his co-anchor, Susan Ortega, after she forcefully comes on to him, and quickly leaves. Bruce follows her, trying to use his powers to convince her to stay but cannot influence her free will. As Bruce looks around, he realizes that Buffalo has fallen into chaos due to his actions: parts of the city believe the Apocalypse is nearly upon Earth due to the meteor strikes, while a large number of people, all having prayed to win the multi-million dollar lottery and received a meager amount in return, have started rioting in the streets. Bruce returns to God, who explains that he cannot solve all the problems and Bruce must figure out a way himself. Bruce then starts to help others without using his powers, including giving Evan his job back. He returns to his computer at home and goes about answering prayers earnestly. As he reads through them, he finds prayers from Grace, wishing for his success and well-being. As Bruce reads it, another prayer from Grace arrives, this one wishing not to be in love with him anymore.

Stunned by this development, Bruce walks alone on a highway, asking God to take back his powers and leaving his fate in His hands. Bruce is suddenly hit by a truck and regains consciousness in a white void. God appears and asks Bruce what he really wants; Bruce admits that he only wants to make sure Grace finds a man that will make her happy. God agrees, and Bruce finds himself in the hospital, where his doctors help him recover. Grace arrives at the hospital and reconciles with Bruce. Following his recovery, Bruce returns to his field reporting job, but decides to take more pleasure in the simple stories in Buffalo instead.

==Cast==
==Production==
In June 2000, it was announced that Universal Pictures had paid over $1 million for a spec script titled &quot;Bruce Almighty&quot; with the intention of positioning the script as a directing vehicle for Tom Shadyac via his Universal based production company Shady Acres. Jim Carrey signed on to star in March 2002 with Steve Oedekerk rewriting the script. Previously, Carrey had been slated to star in another comedy for Universal titled &#x27;Dog Years&#x27; to be directed by Gary Ross, but following that film&#x27;s cancellation, Universal was eager to get Carrey onto another project.

Filming of Buffalo was done in the &quot;New York Street&quot; at Universal Studios Hollywood. The restaurant with Tony Bennett was filmed at Cicada, in the James Oviatt Building, downtown Los Angeles. The spa scene with Jennifer Aniston was filmed in the &quot;Shoin&quot; building at The Japanese Garden in Los Angeles.

==Release==
&quot;Bruce Almighty&quot; was released on May 23, 2003, by Universal Pictures. Universal handled distribution in the United States and Canada (although they were originally planned to distribute the movie worldwide) while Spyglass Entertainment handled sales rights internationally. Buena Vista International acquired distribution rights in a majority of regions except in Scandinavia, Portugal and Japan, where it was handled by distributors who already held deals with Spyglass in those respective territories. United International Pictures and Pony Canyon respectively handled theatrical and home video rights in Japan, while SF Studios handled Scandinavian distribution through subsidiaries AB Svensk Filmindustri in Sweden, SF Film A/S in Denmark and FS Film Oy in Finland.

===Home media===
&quot;Bruce Almighty&quot; was released on DVD and VHS on November 25, 2003. The DVD version features separate widescreen and fullscreen versions, along with Dolby Digital and DTS audio tracks.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Bruce Almighty&quot; earned $67.9 million during its opening weekend, which made it the highest for a Jim Carrey film, surpassing &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot;. This record would be held until the opening of &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot; in 2022. At the time, it was one of three Universal films of 2003 to make opening weekends of $50 million, joining &quot;2 Fast 2 Furious&quot; and &quot;Hulk&quot;. In its first four days, the film generated a total of $86.4 million, becoming the second-highest Memorial Day weekend debut, behind &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot;. It opened in the number one spot at the box office, beating &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;. The film would be dethroned by &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; in its second weekend, declining by 45.1% and making $37.3 million.

The film was released in the United Kingdom on June 27, 2003, and topped the country&#x27;s box office that weekend. There, it made a total of $8.3 million, beating &quot;Batman Forever&quot; to have the highest opening weekend for a Jim Carrey film in the country.

&quot;Bruce Almighty&quot; joined &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;, &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;, &quot;X2&quot; and &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot; to become the first five films to earn over $200 million at the box office in one summer season. By the end of its theatrical run, the film had made $242 million domestically and a total $484 million worldwide, making it Aniston and Carrey&#x27;s highest-grossing film worldwide, as well as the fifth-highest-grossing film of 2003.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 48% based on 191 reviews, with an average rating of 5.7/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Carrey is hilarious in the slapstick scenes, but &quot;Bruce Almighty&quot; gets bogged down in treacle.&quot; On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 46 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three out of four stars, calling it: &quot;A charmer, the kind of movie where Bruce learns that while he may not ever make a very good God, the experience may indeed make him a better television newsman.&quot; Ebert praised Aniston&#x27;s performance: &quot;Aniston, as a sweet kindergarten teacher and fiancée, shows again (after &quot;The Good Girl&quot;) that she really will have a movie career.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot;″s Robert Koehler gave the film a mixed review: &quot;There&#x27;s remarkably little done with a premise snatched from high-concept heaven, adding yet another file to the growing cabinet of under-realized comedies.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; gave it a negative review and called it &quot;not so mighty&quot;.

Chuck Rudolph of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; said, &quot;In several ways, the movie is an apathetic revision of &quot;The Truman Show&quot;, with Carrey starring as both Truman and Christof.&quot;

===Controversies===
The film was banned in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kuwait and Qatar because of its portrayal of God as an ordinary man and its being blasphemous to Islam. Bans in both Malaysia and Egypt were eventually lifted after the nations&#x27; censorship boards gave the film their highest rating (18-PL in the case of Malaysia).

As God contacts Bruce using an actual phone number rather than one in the standard fictional 555 telephone exchange, several people and groups sharing this number received hundreds of phone calls from people wanting to talk to God, including a church in North Carolina, US (where the minister was named Bruce), a Florida woman who threatened to sue Universal Pictures, a pastor in northern Wisconsin and a man running a sandwich shop in Manchester, England. The producers noted that the number (776-2323) was not in use in the area code (716, which was never specified on screen) in the film&#x27;s story, but did not check anywhere else. For the home video and television versions of the film, the number was changed to the fictional 555–0123.

===Sequel===

A sequel and spin-off, titled &quot;Evan Almighty&quot;, was released on June 22, 2007, with Steve Carell reprising his role as Evan Baxter and Morgan Freeman returning to his role as God. Although Shadyac returned to direct the sequel, neither Carrey nor Aniston were involved with the film, and Carrey&#x27;s character, Bruce, is never mentioned in the film. The film was a critical and commercial failure.

Before &quot;Evan Almighty&quot; materialized, screenwriters Steve Koren and Mark O’Keefe envisioned a sequel with the title &quot;Brucifer&quot;. The proposed sequel involved Aniston&#x27;s character dying and Carrey&#x27;s character, under the weight of his grief, takes on Satan&#x27;s powers, which he uses to resurrect Aniston&#x27;s character.

<text>In mathematics, Abel&#x27;s theorem for power series relates a limit of a power series to the sum of its coefficients. It is named after Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel, who proved it in 1826.

==Theorem==

Let the Taylor series
formula_1
be a power series with real coefficients formula_2 with radius of convergence formula_3 Suppose that the series 
formula_4 
converges. 
Then formula_5 is continuous from the left at formula_6 that is,
formula_7

The same theorem holds for complex power series 
formula_8 
provided that formula_9 entirely within a single &quot;Stolz sector&quot;, that is, a region of the open unit disk where
formula_10
for some fixed finite formula_11. Without this restriction, the limit may fail to exist: for example, the power series
formula_12
converges to formula_13 at formula_14 but is unbounded near any point of the form formula_15 so the value at formula_16 is not the limit as formula_17 tends to 1 in the whole open disk.

Note that formula_18 is continuous on the real closed interval formula_19 for formula_20 by virtue of the uniform convergence of the series on compact subsets of the disk of convergence. Abel&#x27;s theorem allows us to say more, namely that the restriction of formula_18 to formula_22 is continuous.

=== Stolz sector ===

The Stolz sector formula_23 has explicit equationformula_24and is plotted on the right for various values.

The left end of the sector is formula_25, and the right end is formula_26. On the right end, it becomes a cone with angle formula_27 where formula_28.

==Remarks==

As an immediate consequence of this theorem, if formula_17 is any nonzero complex number for which the series 
formula_30 
converges, then it follows that
formula_31
in which the limit is taken from below.

The theorem can also be generalized to account for sums which diverge to infinity. If
formula_32
then 
formula_33

However, if the series is only known to be divergent, but for reasons other than diverging to infinity, then the claim of the theorem may fail: take, for example, the power series for 
formula_34

At formula_16 the series is equal to formula_36 but formula_37

We also remark the theorem holds for radii of convergence other than formula_38: let 
formula_39 
be a power series with radius of convergence formula_40 and suppose the series converges at formula_41 Then formula_5 is continuous from the left at formula_43 that is,
formula_44

==Applications==

The utility of Abel&#x27;s theorem is that it allows us to find the limit of a power series as its argument (that is, formula_17) approaches formula_46 from below, even in cases where the radius of convergence, formula_40 of the power series is equal to formula_46 and we cannot be sure whether the limit should be finite or not. See for example, the binomial series. Abel&#x27;s theorem allows us to evaluate many series in closed form. For example, when 
formula_49
we obtain 
formula_50 
by integrating the uniformly convergent geometric power series term by term on formula_51; thus the series 
formula_52 
converges to formula_53 by Abel&#x27;s theorem. Similarly, 
formula_54 
converges to formula_55

formula_56 is called the generating function of the sequence formula_57 Abel&#x27;s theorem is frequently useful in dealing with generating functions of real-valued and non-negative sequences, such as probability-generating functions. In particular, it is useful in the theory of Galton–Watson processes.

==Outline of proof==

After subtracting a constant from formula_58 we may assume that formula_59 Let formula_60 Then substituting formula_61 and performing a simple manipulation of the series (summation by parts) results in
formula_62

Given formula_63 pick formula_64 large enough so that formula_65 for all formula_66 and note that
formula_67
when formula_17 lies within the given Stolz angle. Whenever formula_17 is sufficiently close to formula_46 we have
formula_71
so that formula_72 when formula_17 is both sufficiently close to formula_46 and within the Stolz angle.

==Related concepts==

Converses to a theorem like Abel&#x27;s are called Tauberian theorems: There is no exact converse, but results conditional on some hypothesis. The field of divergent series, and their summation methods, contains many theorems &quot;of abelian type&quot; and &quot;of tauberian type&quot;.

<text>Anthony Cappiello John Lovato (born June 20, 1980) is an American musician who serves as the vocalist and guitarist of the pop punk band Mest. He is also Demi Lovato&#x27;s cousin.

== Early life ==
Lovato was born in Blue Island, Illinois. He started getting involved in music at 12 years old and played drums for the White power band Confederate Storm. Lovato later condemned his actions, stating that he left the band at the age of 13 or 14, thinking, &quot;This isn&#x27;t who I am. I&#x27;ve got Mexican friends and I&#x27;ve got black friends, and I don&#x27;t dislike them, so how can I be part of this when my true feelings are everything that&#x27;s not that?&quot; He later became involved in anti-racist activism, drawing on his experience to educate others on issues of race and influence.

== Musical career ==
=== Mest (1995–2006, 2008–present) ===
Lovato, his brother Steve and their cousin Matt founded Mest in 1995. Lovato wrote the majority of the lyrics for their self-released debut studio album &quot;Mo&#x27; Money, Mo&#x27; 40z&quot;, released in 1998. Their major label debut, &quot;Wasting Time&quot;, was released in July 2000 via Maverick Records. Their third studio album &quot;Destination Unknown&quot;, was released in October 2001. The band&#x27;s self-titled album was released in June 2003, produced by John Feldmann. Their fifth album, &quot;Photographs&quot;, was released in October 2005.
In 2006, the band announced on their Myspace page that they were disbanding.

In October 2008, Lovato staged a reunion tour of Mest, with Steve Lovato taking bass guitar duties, Chris Wilson (formerly of Good Charlotte) taking over on drums, and Ryan Clayton covering lead guitar. None of the other former members of Mest took part in the reunion.

A brief reunion a few years later set the stage for the band to get back together, and they toured as well as releasing the sixth studio album &quot;Not What You Expected&quot; in January 2013. Their first acoustic album, &quot;Broken Down&quot;, was released in March 2014, and their second, &quot;Broken Down 2&quot;, in October 2017.

On September 13, 2019, they released a single titled &quot;The Upside Down&quot; from the seventh studio album, &quot;Masquerade&quot;, which was released in January 2020.

On April 10, 2024, Mest released their new single &quot;When We Were Young&quot;, and released &quot;Hate You Sober&quot; on May 16, 2024, both were featured on their eighth studio album &quot;Youth&quot;, which was released on June 20, 2024

=== Kisses for Kings (2006–2011) ===
In 2006, after Lovato moved to Los Angeles, he started his new project, A Permanent Holiday. Founding members included Jordon &quot;Charlie Scene&quot; Terrell (of Hollywood Undead) on guitar, Jorell &quot;J-Dog&quot; Decker (of Hollywood Undead) on bass and Adam Garbett (of Just Ask) on drums. Shortly after its launch, he gave a preview of the new project with several demos including &quot;The Thought of You&quot;, &quot;A Taste of Honesty&quot;, &quot;The Night&quot; and another unmixed demo called &quot;SOS&quot;. They have performed on the 2007 Warped Tour and toured in July 2009 with Hollywood Undead, Red Jumpsuit Apparatus and The Sleeping on the &quot;Taking Care of Business Tour&quot;.

In 2009, the band announced they would be returning with new name Kisses for Kings an entirely new lineup – Lovato on vocals, Mike Longworth on guitar, Ryan Clayton on bass, and Richie Gonzales on drums – and released five demo tracks titled &quot;Like Always&quot; (featuring M. Shadows), &quot;Forgive Me&quot;, &quot;Bad Disease&quot;, &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know What I Know&quot; and &quot;Risk It All&quot;.

In May 2010, the band released debut EP &quot;Forget to Remember&quot; which included collaborations with Deuce, Johnny 3 Tears and Craig Mabbitt.

After releasing the EP in 2010, no public updates were made regarding the future of Kisses for Kings.

=== London Falling (2015) ===
In 2015, Lovato started new project with former Falling in Reverse bassist, Ronnie Ficarro, called London Falling. In April 2016, the band released their debut single &quot;Nightmare&quot; off their upcoming EP. In 2015, Lovato performed twice for each concert on the Three-Headed Monstour, once with London Falling and once with Mest.

=== Other appearances ===
Lovato appeared in Good Charlotte&#x27;s music videos for &quot;Festival Song&quot;, &quot;The Anthem&quot; and &quot;Like It&#x27;s Her Birthday&quot;. He also made an appearance in Escape the Fate&#x27;s music video &quot;Something&quot; and &quot;City of Sin&quot;, Hollywood Undead&#x27;s music video &quot;Everywhere I Go&quot; and The Vibrators&#x27;s music video &quot;One More&quot;.

== Legal issues ==
In 2007, Lovato was jailed on suspicion of murder in Los Angeles after police said he confessed to stabbing his then-current girlfriend&#x27;s ex-boyfriend. He was held in lieu of $1 million bail after telling police that he was assaulted earlier in the day by Wayne Hughes, 25, in the underground parking lot of Archstone Apartments in the suburb of Studio City. On March 26, 2007, Good Charlotte&#x27;s Benji and Joel Madden expressed their sadness, telling MTV Radio, &quot;We&#x27;re all praying for him. We&#x27;re really bummed. We all have faith that it&#x27;ll all work out for the best.&quot; The following day, Lovato was released from jail and homicide charges against him were dropped. A spokeswoman for the Los Angeles District Attorney&#x27;s office stated: &quot;We determined that the suspect and victim had dated the same girl back-and-forth for over a year. There had been threats, and the victim sent several threatening messages to the suspect. Apparently, there was some mutual combat and Lovato attempted to separate himself from the victim when the victim challenged him to a fight. The victim followed Lovato to an isolated spot in the underground garage and tried to fight him. Lovato defended himself, and there was insufficient evidence to show that it was not a justifiable use of reasonable force in self-defense&quot;.

<doc id="237326" wikidata="Q1133611" url="?curid=237326" title="Paul Stookey">
<text>Noel Paul Stookey (born December 30, 1937) is an American singer-songwriter and activist who is known for being a member of the 1960s folk trio Peter, Paul and Mary along with Peter Yarrow and Mary Travers. He has been known by his first name, Noel, throughout his life. He is the last surviving member of the group, following the deaths of Mary Travers in 2009 and Peter Yarrow in 2025. Stookey continues to work as a solo artist and an activist.

Stookey is portrayed by Stephen Carter Carlsen in the 2024 film &quot;A Complete Unknown&quot;.

== Early life ==
Stookey was born in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. His family moved to Birmingham, Michigan, when he was 12 years old, and he graduated from Birmingham High School (now Seaholm High School) in 1955.

Stookey attended Michigan State University (MSU) in East Lansing, Michigan but did not graduate. While attending MSU, he joined Delta Upsilon fraternity. Though he credits a deep spiritual core for his work, Stookey &quot;dispelled reports that he was born a Buddhist, saying his mother was a Roman Catholic and his dad was an ex-Mormon&quot; and recalling the family&#x27;s &quot;eclectic attendance at church. I had no real spiritual sense until I was 30.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Stookey married Elizabeth &quot;Betty&quot; Bannard in 1963 and they have three daughters. After raising their family in Blue Hill, Maine, the couple lived for several years in Massachusetts while Betty served as the Northfield Mount Hermon School chaplain and they returned to Maine in 2005. Stookey continued recording his solo albums in his private studio—a converted four-story henhouse—on his Maine property. This studio, known as &quot;The Henhouse&quot;, was also the origin point of the first broadcasts of WERU upon that station&#x27;s inception in 1988.

== Music career ==
=== Peter, Paul and Mary ===
Performing as &quot;Paul&quot; in the Peter, Paul and Mary trio, he participated in one of the best-known ensembles of the 1960s phase of the American folk music revival, and included some of his solo songs and extended monologs in their performances and recordings. In May 1963, Stookey discussed the evolution of his music and the formation of Peter, Paul and Mary on Folk Music Worldwide, an international short-wave radio station in New York City.

One of Stookey&#x27;s songs, &quot;Norman Normal&quot;, which appeared on &quot;The Peter, Paul and Mary Album&quot; (1966), inspired a Warner Bros. animated cartoon also titled &quot;Norman Normal&quot; (1968). Stookey co-wrote the story for the cartoon and voiced several of the characters.

In addition to his recordings with the trio, he released a number of solo works, several albums with the ensemble Bodyworks, and some anthologies. He was an important artist in the young Jesus music movement, which would later bloom into the Christian music industry, although his generally liberal political views distinguish him from many such artists.

Stookey was awarded the Kate Wolf Memorial Award by the World Folk Music Association in 2000.

=== Solo career ===
During 1971 and 1972 Warner released a debut solo album by each member of the group. Each of these had similarly styled cover art. Stookey&#x27;s album &quot;Paul and&quot; was the highest of the three on the music charts, reaching number 42 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart in the United States in September 1971 and number 51 in Canada.

In 1973, Stookey performed at Carnegie Hall and released the concert as his second solo album calling it &quot;One Night Stand&quot;. With the release of &quot;One Night Stand&quot;, Stookey changed his name from Noel Paul Stookey to Paul Stookey.

Stookey&#x27;s best-known composition &quot;The Wedding Song (There Is Love)&quot; was included on his debut solo album. The song was also released as a single which reached number 24 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. He wrote the song as a wedding gift for Peter Yarrow, and refused to perform it for the public until Yarrow requested it at a concert where his wife was present. Stookey assigned the copyright of this song to the Public Domain Foundation (PDF), a nonprofit 501(c)3.
=== After Peter, Paul and Mary ===
Paul performed as a member of Peter, Paul and Mary until the death of Mary in September 2009. His work after Peter, Paul and Mary has emphasized his faith, family life and social concerns. He remains active in the music industry, performing as a solo act, and occasionally performed with Peter Yarrow.

In 1986, Stookey teamed up with Jim Newton, Paul G. Hill, and Denny Bouchard at Celebration Shop in Texas. The company, now known as Kidlinks, uses original musical compositions as music therapy to address the special needs of children. The company has produced three award-winning children&#x27;s CDs used in hospitals, medical camps and homes across the country.

In 2000 Noel and his daughter, Elizabeth Stookey Sunde, founded the nonprofit Music to Life, which builds on the strong historical legacy of social movements&#x27; intentional use of music to educate, recruit, and mobilize.

In January 2011, centered on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Stookey participated in several events at Dartmouth College that celebrated King&#x27;s life, including &quot;Music for Social Change with Noel Paul Stookey and Company.&quot;

=== Production ===
He also has production credits on a wide range of albums including jazz saxophonist Paul Winter, comedian Tim Sample and several singer-songwriters, among them Dave Mallett, Michael Kelly Blanchard and Gordon Bok. He was the founder of the Neworld Multimedia record label.

<doc id="237330" wikidata="Q1394547" url="?curid=237330" title="Lumbricals of the hand">
<text>The lumbricals are intrinsic muscles of the hand that flex the metacarpophalangeal joints, and extend the interphalangeal joints.

The lumbrical muscles of the foot also have a similar action, though they are of less clinical concern.

== Structure ==
The lumbricals are four, small, worm-like muscles on each hand. These muscles are unusual in that they do not attach to bone. Instead, they attach proximally to the tendons of flexor digitorum profundus, and distally to the extensor expansions. The first and second lumbricals are unipennate, while the third and fourth lumbricals are bipennate.

===Nerve supply===
The first and second lumbricals (the most radial two) are innervated by the median nerve. The third and fourth lumbricals (most ulnar two) are innervated by the deep branch of ulnar nerve.

This is the usual innervation of the lumbricals (occurring in 60% of individuals). However 1:3 (median:ulnar - 20% of individuals) and 3:1 (median:ulnar - 20% of individuals) also exist. The lumbrical innervation always follows the innervation pattern of the associated muscle unit of flexor digitorum profundus (i.e. if the muscle units supplying the tendon to the middle finger are innervated by the median nerve, the second lumbrical will also be innervated by the median nerve).

===Blood supply===
Four separate sources supply blood to these muscles: the superficial palmar arch, the common palmar digital artery, the deep palmar arch, and the dorsal digital artery.
== Function ==
The lumbrical muscles, with the help of the interosseous muscles, simultaneously flex the metacarpophalangeal joints while extending both interphalangeal joints of the digit on which it inserts. The lumbricals are used during an upstroke in writing.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;lumbrical&quot; comes from the Latin, meaning &quot;worm&quot;.

<text>Black Patti Records was a short-lived American record label based in Chicago, Illinois, United States, founded by Mayo Williams in 1927. It was named after the black opera singer Matilda Sissieretta Joyner Jones, who was called Black Patti because some thought she resembled the Italian opera singer Adelina Patti. The label lasted seven months and produced 55 records. The Black Patti peacock logo was used in the 1960s by Nick Perls for his Belzona and Yazoo labels.

At Paramount, Mayo Williams was a successful producer of race records, i.e., records made by black musicians to be sold to black customers. When he left Paramount to start Black Patti, he had no equipment, only his Chicago office space. The records were pressed at Gennett Records in Richmond, Indiana. The catalog included jazz, blues, sermons, spirituals, and vaudeville skits, most but not all by black entertainers. Willie Hightower was among the musicians who recorded for the label. Williams closed the label before the end of 1927.

<text>The ( or , ; from its incipit, ) is a Latin Christian hymn traditionally ascribed to a date before AD 500, but perhaps with antecedents that place it much earlier. It is central to the Ambrosian hymnal, which spread throughout the Latin Church with other parts of the Ambrosian Rite of Milan in the 6th to 8th centuries. It is sometimes known as the Ambrosian Hymn, although authorship by Saint Ambrose is unlikely. The term can also refer to a short religious service (of blessing or thanks) that is based upon the hymn.

It continues in use in many contexts by several denominations. In particular it is the core of a short church service of thanksgiving held, often at short notice, to celebrate good news such as a military victory, the signing of a peace treaty, or the birth of a royal child.

== History ==
Authorship of the hymn is traditionally ascribed to Saint Ambrose (died 397) or Saint Augustine (died 430).
In 19th-century scholarship, Saint Hilary of Poitiers (died 367) and Saint Nicetas of Remesiana (died 414) were proposed as possible authors. In the 20th century, the association with Nicetas has been deprecated, so that the hymn, while almost certainly dating to the 4th century, is considered as being of uncertain authorship. Authorship of Nicetas of Remesiana was suggested by the association of the name &quot;Nicetas&quot; with the hymn in manuscripts from the 10th century onward, and was particularly defended in the 1890s by Germain Morin. Hymnologists of the 20th century, especially Ernst Kähler (1958), have shown the association with &quot;Nicetas&quot; to be spurious. The Te Deum has structural similarities with a eucharistic prayer and it has been proposed that it was originally composed as part of one. 

The hymn was part of the Old Hymnal since it was introduced to the Benedictine order in the 6th century, and it was preserved in the Frankish Hymnal of the 8th century. It was, however, removed from the New Hymnal which became prevalent in the 10th century. It was restored in the 12th century in hymnals that attempted to restore the praiseful intent of the Rule of St. Benedict, Chap. 12: How the Morning Office Is to Be Said.

In the traditional office, the &quot;Te Deum&quot; is sung at the end of Matins on all days when the Gloria is said at Mass; those days are all Sundays outside Advent, Septuagesima, Lent, and Passiontide; on all feasts (except the Triduum) and on all ferias during Eastertide.

Before the 1961 reforms of Pope John XXIII, neither the &quot;Gloria&quot; nor the &quot;Te Deum&quot; were said on the feast of the Holy Innocents, unless it fell on Sunday, as they were martyred before the death of Christ and therefore could not immediately attain the beatific vision. 

In the Liturgy of the Hours of Pope Paul VI, the Te Deum is sung at the end of the Office of Readings on all Sundays except those in Lent, on all solemnities, on the octaves of Easter and Christmas, and on all feasts. The revised Handbook of Indulgences (fourth edition) grants a plenary indulgence, under the usual conditions, to those who recite it in public on New Year&#x27;s Eve.

In the Daily Office of the Catholic Ordinariates the Te Deum is sung at Morning Prayer as the Canticle following the First Lesson. It is appointed for (1) Sundays except in Pre-Lent and Lent, (2) Feasts and Solemnities, and (3) all days during the Octaves of Christmas, Easter, and Pentecost.

It is also used together with the standard canticles in Morning Prayer as prescribed in the Anglican Book of Common Prayer, as an option in Morning Prayer or Matins for Lutherans, and is retained by many churches of the Reformed tradition.

The hymn is in regular use in the Catholic Church, Lutheran Church, Anglican Church and Methodist Church (mostly before the Homily) in the Office of Readings found in the Liturgy of the Hours, and in thanksgiving to God for a special blessing such as the election of a pope, the consecration of a bishop, the canonization of a saint, a religious profession, the publication of a treaty of peace, a royal coronation, etc. It is sung either after Mass or the Divine Office or as a separate religious ceremony. The hymn also remains in use in the Anglican Communion and some Lutheran Churches in similar settings.

==Music and text==
Originally, the hymn Te Deum was written on a Gregorian chant melody. The petitions at the end of the hymn (beginning &quot;Salvum fac populum tuum&quot;) are a selection of verses from the book of Psalms, appended subsequently to the original hymn.

The hymn follows the outline of the Apostles&#x27; Creed, mixing a poetic vision of the heavenly liturgy with its declaration of faith. Calling on the name of God immediately, the hymn proceeds to name all those who praise and venerate God, from the hierarchy of heavenly creatures to those Christian faithful already in heaven to the Church spread throughout the world.

The hymn then returns to its credal formula, naming Christ and recalling his birth, suffering and death, his resurrection and glorification. At this point the hymn turns to the subjects declaiming the praise, both the universal Church and the singer in particular, asking for mercy on past sins, protection from future sin, and the hoped-for reunification with the elect.

== Latin and English text ==

&quot;In the Book of Common Prayer, verse is written in half-lines, at which reading pauses, indicated by colons in the text.&quot;

==Indulgence==
The &quot;Enchiridion Indulgentiarum&quot; of 2004 grants plenary or partial indulgence under certain circumstances.

==Service==
A Te Deum service is a short religious service, based upon the singing of the hymn, held to give thanks. In Sweden, for example, it may be held in the Royal Chapel in connection with the birth of a prince or princess, christenings, milestone birthdays, jubilees and other important events within the royal family of Sweden. 

In Luxembourg, a service is held annually in the presence of the grand-ducal family to celebrate the Grand Duke&#x27;s Official Birthday, which is also the nation&#x27;s national day, on either 23 or 24 June. 

In the Autonomous Region of Madeira, the Bishop of Funchal holds a Te Deum service on December 31 of each year.

It is also celebrated in some South American countries such as Argentina, Chile, and Peru on their national days.

==Musical settings==

The text has been set to music by many composers, with settings by Zelenka, Handel, Haydn, Mozart, Berlioz, Verdi, Bruckner, Furtwängler, Dvořák, Britten, Kodály, and Pärt among the better known. Jean-Baptiste Lully wrote a setting of Te Deum for the court of Louis XIV of France, and received a fatal injury while conducting it. Michel Richard de Lalande wrote a setting of the Te Deum, S.32. The prelude to Marc-Antoine Charpentier&#x27;s setting (H.146) is well known in Europe on account of its being used as the theme music for Eurovision network broadcasts of the European Broadcasting Union, most notably the Eurovision Song Contest and &quot;Jeux Sans Frontières&quot;. He wrote also three other settings of the Te Deum: H.145, H.147, H.148. Henry Desmarets, two settings of Te Deum (1687). Louis-Nicolas Clérambault wrote three settings of the Te Deum: C.137, C.138, C.155. Earlier it had been used as the theme music for Bud Greenspan&#x27;s documentary series, &quot;The Olympiad&quot;. Sir William Walton&#x27;s &quot;Coronation Te Deum&quot; was written for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. Other English settings include those by Thomas Tallis, William Byrd, Henry Purcell, Edward Elgar, Richard St. Clair and Herbert Howells, as well as five settings by George Frideric Handel and three settings by Charles Villiers Stanford.

Puccini&#x27;s opera &quot;Tosca&quot; features a dramatic performance of the initial part of the Te Deum at the end of Act I.

The traditional chant melody was the basis for elaborate Te Deum compositions by notable French composer organists, Louis Marchand, Guillaume Lasceux, Charles Tournemire (1930), Jean Langlais (1934), and Jeanne Demessieux (1958), which are still widely performed today.

A version by Father Michael Keating is popular in some Charismatic circles. Mark Hayes wrote a setting of the text in 2005, with Latin phrases interpolated amid primarily English lyrics. In 1978, British hymnodist Christopher Idle wrote &quot;God We Praise You&quot;, a version of the text in 8.7.8.7.D meter, set to the tune &quot;Rustington&quot;. British composer John Rutter has composed two settings of this hymn, one entitled &quot;Te Deum&quot; and the other &quot;Winchester Te Deum&quot;. Igor Stravinsky set the first 12 lines of the text as part of &quot;The Flood&quot; in 1962. Antony Pitts was commissioned by the London Festival of Contemporary Church Music to write a setting for the 2011 10th Anniversary Festival. The 18th-century German hymn &quot;Großer Gott, wir loben dich&quot; is a free translation of the Te Deum, which was translated into English in the 19th century as &quot;Holy God, We Praise Thy Name.&quot;

<text>National colours are frequently part of a country&#x27;s set of national symbols. Many states and nations have formally adopted a set of colours as their official &quot;national colours&quot; while others have &quot;de facto&quot; national colours that have become well known through popular use. National colours often appear on a variety of different media, from the nation&#x27;s flag to the colours used in sports. Before World War I, they also served as the colours of different military uniforms for each nation or region.

== Supranational organisations ==
Some noted supranational organisations like the United Nations and the European Union have their own colours as part of their branding and marketing. They are usually taken from the organisation&#x27;s flag. Although they do not have national sporting teams, the colours can be used for anything connected to the organisation, like associated bodies.

===Examples of use of these colours===
* United Nations: the recognisable blue helmets of the peacekeeping operations and the flags of associated UN agencies like the World Health Organization, with the UN&#x27;s light blue and white.
* European Union: the blue and yellow of the EU flag; uses include the blue European Health Insurance Card and the Blue Card for skilled immigration.

<text>Adelina Patti (19 February 184327 September 1919) was an Italian opera singer. At the height of her career, she was earning huge fees performing in the music capitals of Europe and America. She first sang in public as a child in 1851, and gave her last performance before an audience in 1914. Along with her near contemporaries Jenny Lind and Thérèse Tietjens, Patti remains one of the most famous sopranos in history, owing to the purity and beauty of her lyrical voice and the unmatched quality of her &quot;bel canto&quot; technique.

The composer Giuseppe Verdi, writing in 1877, described her as being perhaps the finest singer who had ever lived and a &quot;stupendous artist&quot;. Verdi&#x27;s admiration for Patti&#x27;s talent was shared by numerous music critics and social commentators of her era.

==Biography==
She was born Adela Juana Maria Patti, in Madrid, the youngest child of tenor Salvatore Patti (1800–1869) and soprano Caterina Barilli (died 1870). Her Italian parents were working in Spain, at the time of her birth. Because her father came from Sicily, Patti was born a subject of the King of the Two Sicilies. She later carried a French passport, as her first two husbands were French.

Her sisters Amalia and Carlotta Patti were also singers. Her brother Carlo Patti was a violinist who married actress Effie Germon. In her childhood, the family moved to New York City. Patti grew up in the Wakefield section of the Bronx, where her family&#x27;s home remains standing. Patti sang professionally from childhood, and developed into a &quot;coloratura&quot; soprano with perfectly equalized vocal registers and a surprisingly warm, satiny tone. Patti learned how to sing and gained understanding of voice technique from her brother-in-law Maurice Strakosch, who was a musician and impresario.

===Vocal development===
Adelina Patti made her operatic debut at age 16 on 24 November 1859 in the title role of Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; at the Academy of Music, New York. On 24 August 1860, she and Emma Albani were soloists in the world premiere of Charles Wugk Sabatier&#x27;s &quot;Cantata&quot; in Montreal which was performed in honour of the visit of the Prince of Wales. In 1861, at the age of 18, she was invited to Covent Garden, to execute the role of Amina in Bellini&#x27;s &quot;La sonnambula&quot;. She had such remarkable success at Covent Garden that season, she bought a house in Clapham and, using London as a base, went on to conquer the European continent, performing Amina in Paris and Vienna in subsequent years with equal success.

During an 1862 American tour, she sang John Howard Payne&#x27;s song &quot;Home! Sweet Home!&quot; at the White House for President Abraham Lincoln and wife, Mary Todd Lincoln. The Lincolns were mourning the death of their son Willie, who had died of typhoid. Moved to tears, the Lincolns requested an encore of the song. Henceforth, it would become associated with Adelina Patti, and she performed it many times as a bonus item at the end of recitals and concerts.
Patti&#x27;s career was one of success after success. She sang not only in England and the United States, but also as far afield in mainland Europe as Russia, and in South America as well, inspiring audience frenzy and critical superlatives wherever she went. Her girlish good looks gave her an appealing stage presence, which added to her celebrity status.

In 1869-1870 she engaged in tours through the Europe and Russia. Concerts in Moscow and Saint Petersburg were very successful and Patti repeated her Russian trips throughout the 1870s. In Russia, she made highly prolific friendships with the top eschelons of Russian aristocracy, musicians, writers and intellectuals such Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Anton Rubinstein, Alexander Serov and Vladimir Stasov. In St. Petersburg, during seasons 1874-75s, Patti met Ernesto Nicolini (in future her second husband) for the first time. At that time she also became acquainted with prominent Russian historian Dmitry Ilovaysky and with his family. This friendship was to last for decades and Ilovaysky&#x27;s cousin Stepan, the stalmeister of Tsar Alexander III even travelled to Wales to meet Adelina during the first half of the 1880s. Patti was also a teacher of Ilovaysky&#x27;s daughter Varvara.

During the 1860s, Patti possessed a sweet, high-lying voice of birdlike purity and remarkable flexibility which was ideal for such parts as Zerlina, Lucia and Amina; but, as Verdi noted in 1878, her lower notes gained fullness and beauty when she grew older, enabling her to excel in weightier fare. Patti, however, turned into a conservative singer in the final phase of her operatic and concert career. She knew what suited her aging voice to perfection and she stuck to it. Typically, her recital programmes during the 1890s featured an array of familiar, often sentimental, not-too-demanding popular tunes of the day, which were sure to appeal to her adoring fans.

But during her mature prime in the 1870s and &#x27;80s, Patti had been a more enterprising singer, proving to be an effective actress in those lyric roles that required the summoning forth of deep emotions, such as Gilda in &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, Leonora in &quot;Il trovatore&quot;, the title part in &quot;Semiramide&quot;, Zerlina in &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; and Violetta in &quot;La traviata&quot;. She also had been prepared to tackle quite dramatic parts in operas like &quot;L&#x27;Africaine&quot;, &quot;Les Huguenots&quot; and even &quot;Aida&quot;. She never attempted to sing any verismo parts, however, because these became popular only in the twilight of her career, during the final decade of the 19th century.
Many years earlier, Patti had experienced an amusing encounter in Paris with the bel canto-opera composer Gioachino Rossini, who was a staunch upholder of traditional Italian singing values. It is related that when Patti&#x27;s mentor (and brother-in-law), Strakosch, presented her to Rossini at one of his fashionable receptions during the 1860s, she was prevailed upon to sing &quot;Una voce poco fa&quot;, from Rossini&#x27;s &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;—with embellishments added by Strakosch to show off the soprano&#x27;s voice. &quot;What composition was that?&quot;, asked the prickly Rossini. &quot;Why, maestro, your own&quot; replied Strakosch. &quot;Oh no, that is not my composition, that is Strakoschonnerie&quot;, Rossini retorted. (&#x27;Cochonnerie&#x27; is a strong French idiom indicating &quot;garbage&quot; and literally meaning &quot;that which is characteristic of or fit for pigs.&quot;)

===Financial acumen and retirement===
In her prime, Patti commanded a payment of $5,000 per night, in gold. Her contracts stipulated that her name be top-billed and printed larger than any other name in the cast.

In his memoirs, the famous opera promoter &quot;Colonel&quot; Mapleson recalled Patti&#x27;s stubborn personality and sharp business sense. She reportedly had a parrot whom she had trained to shriek, &quot;CASH! CASH!&quot; whenever Mapleson walked in the room. Jerome K. Jerome wrote in 1926:

Patti enjoyed the trappings of fame and wealth, but she was not profligate with her earnings, especially after losing a large proportion of her assets as a result of the break-up of her first marriage (see below). She invested wisely large sums of money, and unlike some of her extravagant former colleagues, such as the star tenor Giovanni Mario, who died in poverty, she saw out her days amid luxurious surroundings.
In 1893, Patti created the title role of &quot;Gabriella&quot; in a now-forgotten opera by Emilio Pizzi at its world premiere in Boston. Patti had commissioned Pizzi to write the opera for her.

Ten years later, she undertook one final singing tour of the United States; however, it turned out to be a critical, financial and personal failure, owing to the deterioration of her voice through age and wear-and-tear. From then on she restricted herself to the occasional concert here or there, or to private performances mounted at a little theatre she had built in her impressive residence, Craig-y-Nos Castle in Wales. She last sang in public on 24 October 1914, taking part in a Red Cross concert at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall that had been organised to aid victims of World War I. She lived long enough to see the war end, dying in 1919 of natural causes.

==Recordings==

The first recordings of her voice were made ca. 1890 on phonograph cylinders for Thomas Marshall in New York. Neither the recorded title, nor their number are known. All but one of these cylinders have been lost. The sole surviving cylinder remains at Syracuse University in New York. Due to its fragility it is unable to be played without the risk of damage.

Patti cut more than 30 disc gramophone recordings of songs and operatic arias (some of them duplicates) — plus one spoken voice recording (a New Year&#x27;s greeting to her third husband, which she intended him to keep as a memento) — at her Welsh home in 1905 and 1906 for the Gramophone &amp; Typewriter Company. By then she was aged in her 60s, with her voice well past its prime after a busy operatic career stretching all the way back to 1859.

Nonetheless, the limpid purity of her tone and the smoothness of her legato line remained uniquely impressive, compensating to some extent for the weakening of her breath control. The records also display a lively singing personality as well as a surprisingly strong chest voice and a mellow timbre. Her trill remains wonderfully fluent and accurate and her diction is excellent. Overall her discs have a charm and musicality that give us a hint of why, at her peak, she commanded $5,000 a night.

Patti&#x27;s recorded legacy included a number of songs and arias from the following operas: &quot;Le Nozze di Figaro&quot;, &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, &quot;Faust&quot;, &quot;Martha&quot;, &quot;Norma&quot;, &quot;Mignon&quot; and &quot;La sonnambula&quot;.

The records were produced by the Gramophone &amp; Typewriter Company, forerunner of EMI Records, and were issued in the United States by the Victor Talking Machine Company. Patti&#x27;s piano accompanist, Landon Ronald, wrote of his first recording session with the diva, &quot;When the little (gramophone) trumpet gave forth the beautiful tones, she went into ecstasies! She threw kisses into the trumpet and kept on saying, &#x27;Ah! Mon Dieu! Maintenant je comprends pourquoi je suis Patti! Oh oui! Quelle voix! Quelle artiste! Je comprends tout!&#x27; [Ah! My Lord! Now I understand why I am Patti! Oh yes! What a voice! What an artist! I understand everything!] Her enthusiasm was so naïve and genuine that the fact that she was praising her own voice seemed to us all to be right and proper.&quot;

Thirty-two Patti recordings were reissued on CD in 1998 by Marston Records (catalogue number 52011-2).

==Personal life==
Engaged as a minor to Henri de Lossy, Baron of Ville, Patti wed three times: first, in 1868, to Henri de Roger de Cahusac, Marquess of Caux (1826–1889). The marriage soon collapsed; both had affairs and de Caux was granted a legal separation in 1877 and divorced in 1885. The union was dissolved with bitterness and cost her half her fortune.

She then lived with the French tenor Ernesto Nicolini for many years until, following her divorce from Caux, she was able to marry him in 1886. That marriage lasted until his death and was seemingly happy, but Nicolini disinherited Patti, suggesting some tension in the last years.

Patti&#x27;s last marriage, in 1899, was to Baron Rolf Cederström (1870–1947), a priggish, but handsome, Swedish aristocrat many years her junior. The Baron severely curtailed Patti&#x27;s social life. He cut down her domestic staff from 40 to 18, but gave her the devotion and flattery that she needed, becoming her sole legatee. After her death, he married a much younger woman. Their only daughter, Brita Yvonne Cederström (born 1924), ended up as Patti&#x27;s sole heir. Patti had no children, but was close to her nieces and nephews. The three-time Tony Award-winning Broadway actress and singer Patti LuPone is a great-grandniece and namesake. Drummer Scott Devours is her third great nephew.

Patti developed a love for billiards and became a reputable player, making guest appearances at many major billiard events for exhibition matches and fancy shot displays.

In her retirement, Patti, now officially Baroness Cederström, settled in the Swansea Valley in Wales, where she purchased Craig-y-Nos Castle. There she had a $2000 billiard table installed, and her own private theatre, a miniature version of the one at Bayreuth, and made her gramophone recordings.

Patti also funded Craig-y-nos railway station on the Neath and Brecon Railway. In 1918, she presented the Winter Garden building from her Craig-y-Nos estate to the city of Swansea. It was re-erected and renamed the Patti Pavilion. She died at Craig-y-Nos and eight months later was buried at the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris to be close to her father and favourite composer, Rossini, in accordance with the wishes in her will.

==Voice==
Adelina Patti had a warm, crystalline, and very agile high soprano voice. Her vocal emission was of perfect equality and her vocal range was wide, from low C to high F (C4 – F6). Regarding her technique, critic Rodolfo Celletti said, &quot;Her voice was a technical marvel. The staccatos were marvels of accuracy, even in the trickiest intervals, her legato was impressively smooth and pure; she connects the voice from note to note, phrase to phrase, lifting and gliding with an exceptional virtuosity. Her chromatic scale was deliciously sweet, and her trill was wonderful and solid.&quot;

==Accolades and homages==
&quot;La Vie parisienne&quot; by Jacques Offenbach, with book by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy (1866), mentions Adelina Patti:
:&quot;Je veux, moi, dans la capitale&quot;
:&quot;Voir les divas qui font fureur&quot;
:&quot;Voir la Patti dans Don Pasquale&quot;
:&quot;Et Thérésa dans le Sapeur&quot;

*In the 1890s, African-American singer Sissieretta Jones adopted the stage name &quot;Black Patti,&quot; and called her company &quot;Black Patti&#x27;s Troubadours.&quot;

<doc id="237373" wikidata="Q1128637" url="?curid=237373" title="National symbol">
<text>A national symbol is a manifestation of a nation or community, serving as a representation of their identity and values. National symbols may be not only applied to sovereign states but also nations and countries in a state of colonial or other forms of dependence, federal integration, or even ethnocultural communities that identify as a &quot;nationality&quot; despite lacking autonomy.

National symbols intend to unite individuals by creating visual, verbal, or iconic representations of the national people, values, goals, culture and/or history. These symbols are often rallied around as part of celebrations of patriotism and/or aspiring nationalism (such as independence, autonomy, and/or separation movements) and are designed to be inclusive and representative of all the people of the national community.

Some official national symbols like seals are insignias that not everybody is allowed to use.

==Unofficial national symbols==
In many ways, well-known sights in a country can also be seen as national symbols, as can traditional items of handicraft, folk costumes, natural monuments, national epics and national myths, as well as symbols used by national sports teams and their supporters.

<text>Kaibun () is the Japanese equivalent of the palindrome, or in other words, a sentence that reads the same from the beginning to the end or from the end to the beginning. The unit of &quot;kaibun&quot; is mora, since the Japanese language uses syllabaries, &quot;hiragana&quot; and &quot;katakana&quot;.

Single-word palindromes are not uncommon in Japanese. For example, &quot;Ku-ku&quot; (, multiplication table), &quot;Shi-n-bu-n-shi&quot; (, newspaper), &quot;to-ma-to&quot; (, tomato), etc. &quot;Kaibun&quot; usually refers to a palindromic sentence, but a passage can be a &quot;kaibun&quot; too.

The topic marker &quot;wa&quot; () can be treated as &quot;ha&quot; and small kana , and are usually allowed to be interpreted as big kana , and . In classics, diacritic marks are often ignored.

Rather than saying &quot;read the same forwards and backwards&quot;, because Japanese is traditionally written vertically, Japanese people describe the words as being the same when read from the top (&quot;ue kara yomu&quot;, ) as when read from the bottom (&quot;shita kara yomu&quot;, ).

==Famous kaibun==

*Ta-ke-ya-bu ya-ke-ta () - A bamboo grove has been burned.
*Wa-ta-shi ma-ke-ma-shi-ta-wa () - I have lost.
*Na-ru-to wo to-ru-na () - Do not take my &quot;naruto&quot; (spiral-shaped fishcake).
*Da-n-su-ga su-n-da () - The dance is over.
*Shi-na-mo-n pa-n mo re-mo-n pa-n mo na-shi () - There is neither cinnamon bread nor lemon bread.
*Na-ga-ki yo-no to-ho-no ne-bu-ri-no mi-na me-za-me na-mi-no-ri-bu-ne-no o-to-no-yo-ki-ka-na () &quot;Tanka&quot; - Everybody gets awakened from a long sleep and enjoys the sound of waves on which the boat is gliding along.
*Yo-no-na-ka, ho-ka-ho-ka na-no-yo () - The world is a warm place.
*Yo-no-na-ka-ne, ka-o-ka o-ka-ne-ka na-no-yo () - In this world, it&#x27;s either looks or money.

<text>Romeo Records was an American jazz record label that started in 1926 as a subsidiary of Cameo Records. The discs were sold exclusively at S. H. Kress &amp; Co. department stores and retailed for 25 cents each.

In 1931 Romeo was acquired by the American Record Corporation and continued through 1938 until the cessation of ARC&#x27;s dime-store labels: (Perfect, Melotone, Banner, and Oriole).

From the beginning, Romeo discs had a maroon label. It was changed to a black label in 1931 and then became blue in 1935.

<text>In J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s legendarium, the Elves or Quendi are a sundered (divided) people. They awoke at Cuiviénen on the continent of Middle-earth, where they were divided into three tribes: Minyar (the Firsts), Tatyar (the Seconds) and Nelyar (the Thirds). After some time, they were summoned by Oromë to live with the Valar in Valinor, on Aman. That summoning and the Great Journey that followed split the Elves into two main groups (and many minor ones), which were never fully reunited.

Tolkien stated that the stories were made to create a world for his elvish languages, not the reverse. The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey writes that &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; derived from the linguistic relationship between the two languages, Quenya and Sindarin, of the divided Elves. The Tolkien scholar Verlyn Flieger states that Tolkien used the Indo-European type of proto-language as his model. In her view, the sundering of the Elves reflects the progressive decline and fall in Middle-earth from its initial perfection; the highest Elves are those who deviated least from that state, meaning that in Tolkien&#x27;s scheme, ancestry is a guide to character.

== Context ==

=== Author ===

J. R. R. Tolkien (1892–1973) is best known as the author of the high fantasy works &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. He was a professional philologist, an expert in the changes in words between languages. He created a family of invented languages for Elves, carefully designing the differences between them to reflect their distance from their imaginary common origin. He stated that his languages led him to create the invented mythology of &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, to provide a world in which his languages could have existed. In that world, the splintering of the Elvish peoples mirrored the fragmentation of their languages.

=== Awakening of the Elves ===

In Tolkien&#x27;s legendarium, the Elves awoke at Cuiviénen, a bay on the eastern side of the Sea of Helcar, on the continent of Middle-earth, where they were divided into three tribes: Minyar (the Firsts), Tatyar (the Seconds) and Nelyar (the Thirds). After some time, they were summoned by the Vala Oromë, the huntsman, to live with him and the other Valar in Valinor, on Aman. The Eldar are those who accepted the summons. Their name, literally &quot;Star People&quot;, was given to them by Oromë, in their own language, Primitive Quendian. The Avari are those who refused the summons. Half of the Avari (the &quot;refusers&quot;) came from the largest tribe, the Nelyar, but most of the Nelyar went on the journey.

== Sundering of the Eldar ==

The Eldar migrated westwards across the north of Middle-earth in their three groups. The Minyar became known as the Vanyar, meaning the &quot;Fair Elves&quot;, with golden-blond hair. The Tatyar who migrated west became known as the Noldor or &quot;Deep Elves&quot;, with deep knowledge of crafts and skills. The Nelyar who went west were known as the Teleri (&quot;Those who come last&quot;) or, as they called themselves, the Lindar or &quot;Singers&quot;. They stayed on the east of Aman, in Tol Eressëa.

=== Sindar ===

Those of the Teleri who reached Beleriand by the Great Sea but chose not to cross to Valinor were later called the Sindar (&quot;Grey Elves&quot;); their language was Sindarin. They stayed in the west of Middle-earth and were ruled by Thingol (Elwë). Many of the Sindar chose to remain behind to look for their lord Thingol, who disappeared near the end of the journey. These later inhabited Doriath, and were named the Iathrim or &quot;People of the Girdle&quot;, for the magical &#x27;Girdle of Melian&#x27; that surrounded and protected the kingdom.

Those who came to the shores of the Great Sea of Belegaer but decided to stay there, or who arrived too late to be ferried, were called the Falathrim (&quot;People of the Shore&quot;). They were ruled by Cirdan the Shipwright.

Those who chose to remain behind and populated the lands to the north-west of Beleriand were called the Mithrim or &quot;Grey People&quot;, giving their name to the region and the great lake there. Most of them later merged with the Noldor who returned to Middle-earth, especially those of Gondolin. Those who reached Aman were called &quot;Amanyar Teleri&quot;; they were also called the Falmari, the &quot;People of the Waves&quot;, expert with ships and the sea.

=== Nandor ===

Those of the Teleri who refused to cross the Misty Mountains and stayed in the valley of Anduin were called the Nandor (&quot;Those [Elves] who turn back&quot;). Those of the Nandor who later entered Beleriand were called the Laiquendi (&quot;Green Elves&quot; or &quot;Green People&quot;, so named because their attire was often green.) &quot;Laiquendi&quot; was the term in Quenya, while the Sindarin version was &quot;Laegrim&quot;. They settled in Ossiriand, an eastern region of Beleriand, and were famous for their singing. Hearing of the peaceful territories of King Thingol, Denethor, son of Lenwë, collected as many of his scattered people as he could and finally ventured westward over the Ered Luin into Ossiriand. Although in some instances the Green-elves of Ossiriand did participate in the battles and strife concerning Morgoth (the First Battle of Beleriand for example), they were for the most part a simple, peaceful, and reclusive people. The Nandor who stayed around Anduin became known as the Tawarwaith, living in Lothlórien and Mirkwood; they were also called Silvan or Wood Elves. They were joined there by those Avari who eventually decided to move to the West.

=== Vanyar ===

The Vanyar were the fairest and most noble of the High Elves; their name means &quot;the Fair&quot;, as they have golden hair. Their small clan was founded by Imin, the first Elf to awaken at Cuiviénen, with his wife Iminyë and their twelve companions: they broadly correspond to the Minyar. Ingwë was the Vanya Elf to travel with the Vala Oromë to Valinor, and became their king. The Vanyar spoke a dialect of Quenya called Vanyarin. Since they stayed in Valinor, they played no part in the wars in Beleriand, except for the War of Wrath that brought an end to the region.

=== Dark and Light Elves ===

The Vanyar, the Noldor, and those of the Teleri who reached Valinor are called the Calaquendi (&quot;Elves of Light&quot;) because they saw the light of the Two Trees of Valinor. In Quenya, the language of the Noldor in Valinor, all other Elves were called the Moriquendi (&quot;Elves of Darkness&quot;) in recognition of the fact that they did not see (and did not desire) the Light of Valinor, but later the Sindar were counted among neither of these groups. Instead, &quot;Moriquendi&quot; was used for all other Elves except Noldor, Vanyar, Falmari, and Sindar. The Sundering allowed Tolkien to explain the existence of Norse mythology&#x27;s &quot;Dökkálfar&quot; and &quot;Ljósálfar&quot;, Dark and Light Elves. The Dark Elves, who lived underground in &quot;Svartalfheim&quot; (&quot;Black Elfhome&quot;), are rehabilitated by Tolkien as his Moriquendi. The Light Elves lived in &quot;Alfheim&quot; (&quot;Elfhome&quot;) and correspond to his Calaquendi.

=== Noldorin Exiles ===

Most of the Noldor returned with Fëanor to Beleriand in Middle-earth before the raising of the Sun. Fëanor however sailed in haste in ships stolen from the (Telerin) Falmari. The Falmari resisted, and Fëanor&#x27;s Noldor fought and killed them in the First Kinslaying, a battle of Elves upon Elves. In addition, Fëanor left behind his half-brother Fingolfin&#x27;s Noldor, who also wanted to return. Fingolfin, furious, was obliged to make the perilous journey on foot via the Helcaraxë, the Grinding Ice of the far north. These groups of Noldor became known as the Exiles. In Beleriand they became divided by their place of dwelling, namely Hithlum, Gondolin, Dorthonion, Nargothrond and the March of Maedhros.

=== Merging of Noldor and Sindar ===

After the War of Wrath that ended the First Age, the greater part of the surviving Noldor and Sindar (mostly mingled into a single people) returned into the West to dwell in Tol Eressëa. The rest remained in Middle-earth throughout the Second and Third Ages, entering the realm of Mirkwood of the Wood Elves or establishing the kingdoms of Lindon, Eregion, Lothlórien and Rivendell.

== Sundering of the Avari ==

After the Separation the Avari became divided even more than the Eldar, though little of their history became known to the Elves and Men of the West of Middle-earth, and they barely feature in the legendarium. At least six kindreds existed, and they continued to call themselves &#x27;Quendi&#x27;, considering those who went away, the Eldar, as deserters. Some of these tribes later journeyed westward, intermingling with the Nandor in Rhovanion, and a few even reached Beleriand, though usually remaining on unfriendly terms with the Sindar.

==Analysis==


Matthew Dickerson, writing in the &quot;J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia&quot;, notes the &quot;very complicated changes, with shifting meanings assigned to the same names&quot; as Tolkien worked on his conception of the Elves and their divisions and migrations. All the same, he notes, Tolkien kept to a consistent scheme. He states that the sundering of the Elves allowed Tolkien, a professional philologist, to develop two Elvish languages, distinct but related, Quenya for the Eldar and Sindarin for the Sindar, citing Tolkien&#x27;s own statement that the stories were made to create a world for the languages, not the reverse.

Shippey suggests that the &quot;real root&quot; of &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; lay in the linguistic relationship, complete with sound-changes and differences of semantics, between the two languages of the divided elves. He adds that the elves are separated not by colour, despite names like light and dark, but by their history, including their migrations.

The Tolkien scholar Verlyn Flieger states that in the &quot;Lhammas&quot; and &quot;The Etymologies&quot; Tolkien used the Indo-European type of proto-languages with branches and sub-branches of language families while inventing his various languages of Middle-earth. This picture of increasing separation is analogous to the progressive decline and fall in Middle-earth from its initial perfection, of which the Sundering of the Elves is a major element. In Tolkien&#x27;s scheme, the highest Elves are those who deviated least from their initial state (complying with the will of the Valar, travelling to Valinor, and continuing to speak the highest language, Quenya). Conversely, the lowest Elves, the Avari, fragmented into many kindreds with different languages as they eventually spread out across Middle-earth. Tolkien thus intended ancestry to be a guide to character; the differences between the various Elvish languages mirror both the Sundering and the events of &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;.

<doc id="237412" wikidata="Q967103" url="?curid=237412" title="Heart sounds">
<text>Heart sounds are the noises generated by the beating heart and the resultant flow of blood through it. Specifically, the sounds reflect the turbulence created when the heart valves snap shut. In cardiac auscultation, an examiner may use a stethoscope to listen for these unique and distinct sounds that provide important auditory data regarding the condition of the heart.

In healthy adults, there are two normal heart sounds, often described as a &quot;lub&quot; and a &quot;dub&quot; that occur in sequence with each heartbeat. These are the first heart sound (S1) and second heart sound (S2),
produced by the closing of the atrioventricular valves and semilunar valves, respectively. In addition to these normal sounds, a variety of other sounds may be present including heart murmurs, adventitious sounds, and gallop rhythms S3 and S4.

Heart murmurs are generated by turbulent flow of blood and a murmur to be heard as turbulent flow must require pressure difference of at least 30 mm of Hg between the chambers and the pressure dominant chamber will outflow the blood to non-dominant chamber in diseased condition which leads to Left-to-right shunt or Right-to-left shunt based on the pressure dominance. Turbulence may occur inside or outside the heart; if it occurs outside the heart then the turbulence is called bruit or &quot;vascular murmur&quot;. Murmurs may be physiological (benign) or pathological (abnormal). Abnormal murmurs can be caused by stenosis restricting the opening of a heart valve, resulting in turbulence as blood flows through it. Abnormal murmurs may also occur with valvular insufficiency (regurgitation), which allows backflow of blood when the incompetent valve closes with only partial effectiveness. Different murmurs are audible in different parts of the cardiac cycle, depending on the cause of the murmur.

==Primary heart sounds==

Normal heart sounds are associated with heart valves closing:

===First heart sound===
The first heart sound, or S1, forms the &quot;lub&quot; of &quot;lub-dub&quot; and is composed of components M1 (mitral valve closure) and T1 (tricuspid valve closure). Normally M1 precedes T1 slightly. It is caused by the closure of the atrioventricular valves, i.e. tricuspid and mitral (bicuspid), at the beginning of ventricular contraction, or systole. When the ventricles begin to contract, so do the papillary muscles in each ventricle. The papillary muscles are attached to the cusps or leaflets of the tricuspid and mitral valves via chordae tendineae (heart strings). When the papillary muscles contract, the chordae tendineae become tense and thereby prevent the backflow of blood into the lower pressure environment of the atria. The chordae tendineae act a bit like the strings on a parachute, and allow the leaflets of the valve to balloon up into the atria slightly, but not so much as to evert the cusp edges and allow backflow of blood. It is the pressure created from ventricular contraction that closes the valve, not the papillary muscles themselves. The contraction of the ventricle begins just prior to AV valves closing and prior to the opening of the semilunar valves. The sudden tensing of the chordae tendineae and the squeezing of the ventricles against closed semilunar valves, send blood rushing back toward the atria, and the parachute-like valves catch the rush of blood in their leaflets causing the valve to snap shut. The S1 sound results from reverberation within the blood associated with the sudden block of flow reversal by the valves. The delay of T1 even more than normally causes the split S1 which is heard in a right bundle branch block.

===Second heart sound===
The second heart sound, or S2, forms the &quot;dub&quot; of &quot;lub-dub&quot; and is composed of components A2 (aortic valve closure) and P2 (pulmonary valve closure). Normally A2 precedes P2 especially during inspiration where a split of S2 can be heard. It is caused by the closure of the semilunar valves (the aortic valve and pulmonary valve) at the end of ventricular systole and the beginning of ventricular diastole. As the left ventricle empties, its pressure falls below the pressure in the aorta. Aortic blood flow quickly reverses back toward the left ventricle, catching the pocket-like cusps of the aortic valve, and is stopped by aortic valve closure. Similarly, as the pressure in the right ventricle falls below the pressure in the pulmonary artery, the pulmonary valve closes. The S2 sound results from reverberation within the blood associated with the sudden block of flow reversal.

Splitting of S2, also known as physiological split, normally occurs during inhalation because the decrease in intrathoracic pressure increases the time needed for pulmonary pressure to exceed that of the right ventricular pressure. A widely split S2 can be associated with several different cardiovascular conditions, and the split is sometimes wide and variable whereas, sometimes wide and fixed. The wide and variable split occurs in Right bundle branch block, pulmonary stenosis, pulmonary hypertension and ventricular septal defects. The wide and fixed splitting of S2 occurs in atrial septal defect. Pulmonary S2 (P2) will be accentuated (loud P2) in pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary embolism. S2 becomes softer in aortic stenosis.

==Extra heart sounds==
The rarer extra heart sounds form gallop rhythms and are heard in both normal and abnormal situations.
===Third heart sound===
The third heart sound, or S3 is rarely heard, and is also called a protodiastolic gallop, ventricular gallop, or informally the &quot;Kentucky&quot; gallop as an onomatopoeic reference to the rhythm and stress of S1 followed by S2 and S3 together (S1=Ken; S2=tuck; S3=y).

&quot;lub-dub-ta&quot; or &quot;slosh-ing-in&quot; If new, indicates heart failure or volume overload.

It occurs at the beginning of diastole after S2 and is lower in pitch than S1 or S2 as it is not of valvular origin. The third heart sound is benign in youth, some trained athletes, and sometimes in pregnancy but if it re-emerges later in life it may signal cardiac problems, such as a failing left ventricle as in dilated congestive heart failure (CHF). S3 is thought to be caused by the oscillation of blood back and forth between the walls of the ventricles initiated by blood rushing in from the atria. The reason the third heart sound does not occur until the middle third of diastole is probably that during the early part of diastole, the ventricles are not filled sufficiently to create enough tension for reverberation.

It may also be a result of tensing of the chordae tendineae during rapid filling and expansion of the ventricle. In other words, an S3 heart sound indicates increased volume of blood within the ventricle. An S3 heart sound is best heard with the bell-side of the stethoscope (used for lower frequency sounds). A left-sided S3 is best heard in the left lateral decubitus position and at the apex of the heart, which is normally located in the 5th left intercostal space at the midclavicular line. A right-sided S3 is best heard at the lower left sternal border. The way to distinguish between left and right-sided S3 is to observe whether it increases in intensity with inhalation or exhalation. A right-sided S3 will increase on inhalation, while a left-sided S3 will increase on exhalation.

S3 can be a normal finding in young patients but is generally pathologic over the age of 40. The most common cause of pathologic S3 is congestive heart failure.

===Fourth heart sound===
The fourth heart sound, or S4 when audible in an adult is called a presystolic gallop or atrial gallop. This gallop is produced by the sound of blood being forced into a stiff or hypertrophic ventricle.

&quot;ta-lub-dub&quot; or &quot;a-stiff-wall&quot;

It is a sign of a pathologic state, usually a failing or hypertrophic left ventricle, as in systemic hypertension, severe valvular aortic stenosis, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The sound occurs just after atrial contraction at the end of diastole and immediately before S1, producing a rhythm sometimes referred to as the &quot;Tennessee&quot; gallop where S4 represents the &quot;Ten-&quot; syllable. It is best heard at the cardiac apex with the patient in the left lateral decubitus position and holding their breath. The combined presence of S3 and S4 is a quadruple gallop, also known as the &quot;Hello-Goodbye&quot; gallop. At rapid heart rates, S3 and S4 may merge to produce a summation gallop, sometimes referred to as S7.

Atrial contraction must be present for production of an S4. It is absent in atrial fibrillation and in other rhythms in which atrial contraction does not precede ventricular contraction.

==Murmurs==

Heart murmurs are produced as a result of turbulent flow of blood strong enough to produce audible noise. They are usually heard as a whooshing sound. The term murmur only refers to a sound believed to originate within blood flow through or near the heart; rapid blood velocity is necessary to produce a murmur. Most heart problems do not produce any murmur and most valve problems also do not produce an audible murmur.

Murmurs can be heard in many situations in adults without major congenital heart abnormalities:
* Regurgitation through the mitral valve is by far the most commonly heard murmur, producing a pansystolic/holosystolic murmur which is sometimes fairly loud to a practiced ear, even though the volume of regurgitant blood flow may be quite small. Yet, though obvious using echocardiography visualization, probably about 20% of cases of mitral regurgitation do not produce an audible murmur.
* Stenosis of the aortic valve is typically the next most common heart murmur, a systolic ejection murmur. This is more common in older adults or in those individuals having a two-leaflet, not a three-leaflet, aortic valve.
* Regurgitation through the aortic valve, if marked, is sometimes audible to a practiced ear with high quality, especially electronically amplified, stethoscope. Generally, this is a very rarely heard murmur, even though aortic valve regurgitation is not so rare. Aortic regurgitation, though obvious using echocardiography visualization, usually does not produce an audible murmur.
* Stenosis of the mitral valve, if severe, also rarely produces an audible, low frequency soft rumbling murmur, best recognized by a practiced ear using high quality, especially electronically amplified, stethoscope.
* Other audible murmurs are associated with abnormal openings between the left ventricle and right heart or from the aortic or pulmonary arteries back into a lower pressure heart chamber.

Though several different cardiac conditions can cause heart murmurs, the murmurs can change markedly with the severity of the cardiac disease. An astute physician can sometimes diagnose cardiac conditions with some accuracy based largely on the murmur, related physical examination, and experience with the relative frequency of different heart conditions. However, with the advent of better quality and wider availability of echocardiography and other techniques, heart status can be recognized and quantified much more accurately than formerly possible with only a stethoscope, examination, and experience. Another advantage to the use of the echocardiogram is that the devices can be handheld.

===Effects of breathing===

Inhalation decreases intrathoracic pressure which allows more venous blood to return to the right heart (pulling blood into the right side of the heart via a vacuum-like effect). Therefore, right-sided heart murmurs generally increase in intensity with inhalation. The decreased (more negative) intrathoracic pressure has an opposite effect on the left side of the heart, making it harder for the blood to exit into circulation. Therefore, left-sided murmurs generally decrease in intensity during inhalation. Increasing venous blood return to the right side of the heart by raising a patient&#x27;s legs to a 45-degree while lying supine produces similar effect which occurs during inhalation. Inhalation can also produce a non-pathological split S2 which will be heard upon auscultation.

With exhalation, the opposite haemodynamic changes occur: left-sided murmurs generally increase in intensity with exhalation.
===Interventions that change murmurs===
There are a number of interventions that can be performed that alter the intensity and characteristics of abnormal heart sounds. These interventions can differentiate the different heart sounds to more effectively obtain a diagnosis of the cardiac anomaly that causes the heart sound.

==Other abnormal sounds==
Clicks – Heart clicks are short, high-pitched sounds that can be appreciated with modern non-invasive imaging techniques.

Rubs – The pericardial friction rub can be heard in pericarditis, an inflammation of the pericardium, the sac surrounding the heart. This is a characteristic scratching, creaking, high-pitched sound emanating from the rubbing of both layers of inflamed pericardium. It is the loudest in systole, but can often be heard at the beginning and at the end of diastole. It is very dependent on body position and breathing, and changes from hour to hour.

==Surface anatomy==
The aortic area, pulmonic area, tricuspid area and mitral area are areas on the surface of the chest where the heart is auscultated.
Heart sounds result from reverberation within the blood associated with the sudden block of flow reversal by the valves closing. Because of this, auscultation to determine function of a valve is usually not performed at the position of the valve, but at the position to where the sound waves reverberate.
==Recording heart sounds==
Using electronic stethoscopes, it is possible to record heart sounds via direct output to an external recording device, such as a laptop or MP3 recorder. The same connection can be used to listen to the previously recorded auscultation through the stethoscope headphones, allowing for a more detailed study of murmurs and other heart sounds, for general research as well as evaluation of a particular patient&#x27;s condition.

<text>Herwin Records was a mail-order record label founded in 1925 by two brothers, Herbert and Edwin Schiele in St. Louis, Missouri. The name of the label comes from their first names (HERbert and EdWIN).

Herwin sold budget jazz, blues, and old-time music discs that were pressed by Gennett and Paramount. The records were advertised in farming magazines and sold through the mail. The catalogue included Charley Patton, Chubby Parker, and Ernest Stoneman.

Herwin closed in 1930 when it was bought by the Wisconsin Chair Company, the owner of Paramount. A second Herwin Records was started in 1971 by Bernard Klatzko, a collector who reissued rare, early-jazz discs.

<text>The aortic valve is a valve in the heart of humans and most other animals, located between the left ventricle and the aorta. It is one of the four valves of the heart and one of the two semilunar valves, the other being the pulmonary valve. The aortic valve normally has three cusps or leaflets, although in 1–2% of the population it is found to congenitally have two leaflets. The aortic valve is the last structure in the heart the blood travels through before stopping the flow through the systemic circulation.

==Structure==
The aortic valve normally has three cusps however there is some discrepancy in their naming. They may be called the left coronary, right coronary and non-coronary cusp. Some sources also advocate they be named as a left, right and posterior cusp. Anatomists have traditionally named them the left posterior (origin of left coronary), anterior (origin of the right coronary) and right posterior.

The three cusps, when the valve is closed, contain a sinus called an aortic sinus or sinus of Valsalva. In two of these cusps, the origin of the coronary arteries are found. The width of the sinuses in cross-section is wider than the left ventricular outflow tract as well as wider than the ascending aorta. The junction of the sinuses with the aorta is called the sinotubular junction. The aortic valve is located posterior to the pulmonary valve and the commissure where the anterior two cusps join together points toward the pulmonary valve. It is these two sinuses that contain the origin of the coronary arteries. In the congenital disease known as transposition of the great arteries, these two valves are reversed (the anterior valve is the aortic valve) and the origin of the coronaries still follows this &quot;rule&quot; that the origins are in the sinuses facing the pulmonary valve.

The term &quot;semilunar&quot; refers to an approximate half-moon shape of the valve leaflets.

==Function==
When the left ventricle contracts (systole), pressure rises in the left ventricle. When the pressure in the left ventricle rises above the pressure in the aorta, the aortic valve opens, allowing blood to exit the left ventricle into the aorta. When ventricular systole ends, pressure in the left ventricle rapidly drops. When the pressure in the left ventricle decreases, the momentum of the vortex at the outlet of the valve forces the aortic valve to close. The closure of the aortic valve contributes the A2 component of the second heart sound (S2). 

===Insufficiency===

Closure of the aortic valve permits maintaining high pressures in the systemic circulation while reducing pressure in the left ventricle to permit blood flow from the lungs to fill the left ventricle. Abrupt loss of function of the aortic valve results in acute aortic regurgitation (also known as acute aortic insufficiency) and loss in the normal diastolic blood pressure resulting in a wide pulse pressure and bounding pulses. The endocardium perfuses during diastole and so acute aortic regurgitation can reduce perfusion of the heart. Consequently, heart failure and pulmonary edema can develop.

Slowly worsening aortic insufficiency results in a chronic aortic regurgitation which permits the heart to compensate (unlike acute aortic regurgitataion). This compensation is through dilation of the left ventricle and return to normal filling pressures.

===Stenosis===
Inadequate opening of the aortic valve, often through calcific aortic valve disease, results in higher flow velocities through the valve and larger pressure gradients. Diagnosis of aortic stenosis is contingent upon quantification of this gradient. This condition also results in hypertrophy of the left ventricle.

==Clinical significance==
A normally functioning valve permits normal physiology and dysfunction of the valve results in left ventricular hypertrophy and heart failure. Dysfunctional aortic valves often present as heart failure by non-specific symptoms such as fatigue, low energy, and shortness of breath with exertion. Common causes of aortic regurgitation include vasodilation of the aorta, previous rheumatic fever, infection such as infective endocarditis, degeneration of the aortic valve, and Marfan&#x27;s syndrome. Aortic stenosis can also be caused by rheumatic fever and degenerative calcification. The most common congenital heart defect is the bicuspid aortic valve (fusion of two cusps together) commonly found in Turner syndrome.
Once diagnosed, the two options are to repair or replace the valve.

=== Aortic valve repair===
Aortic valve repair or aortic valve reconstruction describes the reconstruction of both form and function of the native and dysfunctioning aortic valve. Most frequently it is applied for the treatment of aortic regurgitation. It can also become necessary for the treatment of aortic aneurysm, or less frequently for congenital aortic stenosis.

===Aortic valve replacement===
Replacement of the aortic valve is done by replacing the native valve with a prosthetic valve. Traditionally, this has been a surgical procedure (surgical AVR or SAVR) but a non-surgical option called transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) or TAVI transcatheter aortic valve implantation delivers a prosthetic valve through a catheter. The choice between SAVR and TAVR often relies on the open-heart surgical risk and indications for other open heart surgeries (etc., coronary bypass, other valve dysfunction). The Bentall procedure is a type of surgical procedure when the aortic valve, aortic root, and ascending aorta are replaced in a single operation.

There are two basic types of artificial heart valve: mechanical and tissue.
* Mechanical valves are made of metal and have evolved over time (&quot;ball and cage&quot;, &quot;bileaflet&quot;). Mechanical valves require lifelong anticoagulation to avoid forming blood clots on the valves that can lead to embolism often resulting in stroke. These tend to be favored in younger individuals as they typically last longer than tissue valves. The shape of these valves do not mimic normal heart valves.
* Tissue heart valves are usually made from animal tissues, either animal heart valve tissue or animal pericardial tissue, commonly from the pig. The tissue is pretreated by removing antigens to prevent rejection and to prevent calcification. These valves tend to model after normal valves by having leaflets that form cusps and sinuses.

There are alternatives to animal tissue valves. In some cases, a human aortic valve can be implanted. These are called homografts. Homograft valves are donated by patients and recovered after the patient expires. The durability of homograft valves is probably the same as for porcine tissue valves. Another procedure for aortic valve replacement is the Ross procedure (after Donald Ross) or pulmonary autograft. The Ross procedure involves going to surgery to have the aortic valve removed and replacing it with the patient&#x27;s own pulmonary valve. A pulmonary homograft (a pulmonary valve taken from a cadaver) or a valvular prothesis is then used to replace the patient&#x27;s own pulmonary valve.

The first minimally invasive aortic valve surgery took place at the Cleveland Clinic in 1996.

==Evaluation==

Evaluation of the aortic valve can be done with several modalities. Auscultation with a stethoscope is quick and easy. It contributes the A2 component to the second heart sound and changes with inspiration (&quot;splitting&quot;) Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is used as the first test because it is non-invasive. Using TTE, the degree of stenosis and insufficiency can be quantified to grade the valve dysfunction. Transesophageal echocardiography is less often used for aortic stenosis &amp; insufficiency because the angle between the probe and the aortic valve is not optimal (the best window is a transgastric view). MRI and CT can be used to evaluate the valve, but much less commonly than TTE.

Quantification of the maximum velocity through the valve, the area of the opening of the valve, calcification, morphology (tricuspid, bicuspid, unicuspid), and size of the valve (annulus, sinuses, sinotubular junction) are common parameters when evaluating the aortic valve.

Invasive measurement of the aortic valve can be done during a cardiac catheterization in which the pressure in the left ventricle and aorta can be measured simultaneously.
