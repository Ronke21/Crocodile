<text>A recoilless rifle (rifled), recoilless launcher (smoothbore), or simply recoilless gun, sometimes abbreviated to &quot;RR&quot; or &quot;RCL&quot; (for ReCoilLess) is a type of lightweight artillery system or man-portable launcher that is designed to eject some form of countermass such as propellant gas from the rear of the weapon at the moment of firing, creating forward thrust that counteracts most of the weapon&#x27;s recoil. This allows for the elimination of much of the heavy and bulky recoil-counteracting equipment of a conventional cannon as well as a thinner-walled barrel, and thus the launch of a relatively large projectile from a platform that would not be capable of handling the weight or recoil of a conventional gun of the same size. Technically, only devices that use spin-stabilized projectiles fired from a rifled barrel are recoilless rifles, while smoothbore variants (which can be fin-stabilized or unstabilized) are recoilless guns. This distinction is often lost, and both are often called recoilless rifles.

Though similar in appearance to a tube-based rocket launcher (since these also operate on a recoilless launch principle), the key difference is that recoilless weapons fire shells using a conventional smokeless propellant. While there are rocket-assisted rounds for recoilless weapons, they are still ejected from the barrel by the deflagration of a conventional propelling charge.

Because some projectile velocity is inevitably lost to the recoil compensation, recoilless rifles tend to have inferior range to traditional cannon, although with a far greater ease of transport, making them popular with paratroop, mountain warfare and special forces units, where portability is of particular concern, as well as with some light infantry and infantry fire support units. The greatly diminished recoil allows for devices that can be carried by individual infantrymen: heavier recoilless rifles are mounted on light tripods, wheeled light carriages, or small vehicles, and intended to be carried by crew of two to five. The largest versions retain enough bulk and recoil to be restricted to a towed mount or relatively heavy vehicle, but are still much lighter and more portable than cannon of the same scale. Such large systems have been replaced by guided anti-tank missiles in many armies.

==History==
The earliest known example of a design for a gun based on recoilless principles was created by Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th or early 16th century. This design was of a gun which fired projectiles in opposite directions, but there is no evidence any physical firearm based on the design was constructed at the time.

In 1879, a French patent was filed by Alfred Krupp for a recoilless gun.

The first recoilless gun known to have actually been constructed was developed by Commander Cleland Davis of the US Navy, just prior to World War I. His design, named the Davis gun, connected two guns back-to-back, with the backwards-facing gun loaded with lead balls and grease of the same weight as the shell in the other gun. His idea was used experimentally by the British as an anti-Zeppelin and anti-submarine weapon mounted on a Handley Page O/100 bomber and intended to be installed on other aircraft. 

In the Soviet Union, the development of recoilless weapons (&quot;Dinamo-Reaktivnaya Pushka&quot; (DRP), roughly &quot;dynamic reaction cannon&quot;) began in 1923. In the 1930s, many different types of weapons were built and tested with configurations ranging from . Some of the smaller examples were tested in aircraft (Grigorovich I-Z and Tupolev I-12) and saw some limited production and service, but development was abandoned around 1938. The best-known of these early recoilless rifles was the &quot;Model 1935 76 mm DRP&quot; designed by Leonid Kurchevsky. A small number of these mounted on trucks saw combat in the Winter War. Two were captured by the Finns and tested; one example was given to the Germans in 1940.

The first recoilless gun to enter service in Germany was the 7.5 cm Leichtgeschütz 40 (&quot;light gun&quot; &#x27;40), a simple 75 mm smoothbore recoilless gun developed to give German airborne troops artillery and anti-tank support that could be parachuted into battle. The 7.5 cm LG 40 was found to be so useful during the invasion of Crete that Krupp and Rheinmetall set to work creating more powerful versions, respectively the 10.5 cm Leichtgeschütz 40 and 10.5 cm Leichtgeschütz 42. These weapons were loosely copied by the US Army. The Luftwaffe also showed great interest in aircraft-mounted recoilless weapons to allow their planes to attack tanks, fortified structures and ships. These included the unusual Düsenkanone 88, an 88 mm recoilless rifle fed by a 10-round rotary cylinder and with the exhaust vent angled upwards at 51 degrees to the barrel so it could pass through the host aircraft&#x27;s fuselage rather than risking a rear-vented backblast damaging the tail, and the Sondergerät SG104 &quot;Münchhausen&quot;, a gargantuan 14-inch (355.6 mm) weapon designed to be mounted under the fuselage of a Dornier Do 217. None of these systems proceeded beyond the prototype stage.

The US did have a development program, and it is not clear to what extent the German designs were copied. These weapons remained fairly rare during the war, although the American M20 became increasingly common in 1945. Postwar saw a great deal of interest in recoilless systems, as they potentially offered an effective replacement for the obsolete anti-tank rifle in infantry units.

During World War II, the Swedish military developed a shoulder-fired 20 mm device, the Pansarvärnsgevär m/42 (20 mm m/42); the British expressed their interest in it, but by that point the weapon, patterned after obsolete anti-tank rifles, was too weak to be effective against period tank armor. This system would form the basis of the much more successful Carl Gustav recoilless rifle postwar.

By the time of the Korean War, recoilless rifles were found throughout the US forces. The earliest American infantry recoilless rifles were the shoulder-fired 57 mm M18 and the tripod-mounted 75 mm M20, later followed by the 105 mm M27: the latter proved unreliable, too heavy, and too hard to aim. Newer models replacing these were the 90 mm M67 and 106 mm M40 (which was actually 105 mm caliber, but designated otherwise to prevent accidental issue of incompatible M27 ammunition). In addition, the Davy Crockett, a muzzle-loaded recoilless launch system for tactical nuclear warheads intended to counteract Soviet tank units, was developed in the 1960s and deployed to American units in Germany.

The Soviet Union adopted a series of crew-served smoothbore recoilless guns in the 1950s and 1960s, specifically the 73 mm SPG-9, 82 mm B-10 and 107 mm B-11. All are found quite commonly around the world in the inventories of former Soviet client states, where they are usually used as anti-tank guns.

The British, whose efforts were led by Charles Dennistoun Burney, inventor of the &quot;Wallbuster&quot; HESH round, also developed recoilless designs. Burney demonstrated the technique with a recoilless 4-gauge shotgun. His &quot;Burney Gun&quot; was developed to fire the Wallbuster shell against the Atlantic Wall defences, but was not required in the D-Day landings of 1944. He went on to produce further designs, with two in particular created as anti-tank weapons. The Ordnance, RCL, 3.45 in could be fired off a man&#x27;s shoulder or from a light tripod, and fired an 11 lb (5 kg) wallbuster shell to 1,000 yards. The larger Ordnance RCL. 3.7in fired a 22.2 lb (10 kg) wallbuster to . Postwar work developed and deployed the BAT (Battalion, Anti Tank) series of recoilless rifles, culminating in the 120 mm L6 WOMBAT. This was too large to be transported by infantry and was usually towed by jeep. The weapon was aimed via a spotting rifle, a modified Bren Gun on the MOBAT and an American M8C spotting rifle on the WOMBAT: the latter fired a .50 BAT (12.7x77mm) point-detonating incendiary tracer round whose trajectory matched that of the main weapon. When tracer rounds hits were observed, the main gun was fired.

During the late 1960s and early 1970s, SACLOS wire-guided missiles began to supplant recoilless rifles in the anti-tank role. While recoilless rifles retain several advantages such as being able to be employed at extremely close range, as a guided missile typically has a significant deadzone before it can arm and begin to seek its target, missile systems tend to be lighter and more accurate, and are better suited to deployment of hollow-charge warheads. The large crew-served recoilless rifle started to disappear from first-rate armed forces, except in areas such as the Arctic, where thermal batteries used to provide after-launch power to wire-guided missiles like M47 Dragon and BGM-71 TOW would fail due to extremely low temperatures. The former 6th Light Infantry Division in Alaska used the M67 in its special weapons platoons, as did the Ranger Battalions and the US Army&#x27;s Berlin Brigade. The last major use was the M50 Ontos, which mounted six M40 rifles on a light () tracked chassis. They were largely used in an anti-personnel role firing &quot;beehive&quot; flechette rounds. In 1970, the Ontos was removed from service and most were broken up. The M40, usually mounted on a jeep or technical, is still very common in conflict zones throughout the world, where it is used as a hard-hitting strike weapon in support of infantry, with the M40-armed technical fulfilling a similar combat role to an attack helicopter.

Front-line recoilless weapons in the armies of modern industrialized nations are mostly man-portable devices such as the Carl Gustav, an 84 mm weapon. First introduced in 1948 and exported extensively since 1964, it is still in widespread use throughout the world today: a huge selection of special-purpose rounds are available for the system, and the current variant, known as the M4 or M3E1, is designed to be compatible with computerized optics and future &quot;smart&quot; ammunition. Many nations also use a weapon derived from the Carl Gustav, the one-shot AT4, which was originally developed in 1984 to fulfil an urgent requirement for an effective replacement for the M72 LAW after the failure of the FGR-17 Viper program the previous year. The ubiquitous RPG-7 is also technically a recoilless gun, since its rocket-powered projectile is launched using an explosive booster charge (even more so when firing the OG-7V anti-personnel round, which has no rocket motor), though it is usually not classified as one.

==Design==

There are a number of principles under which a recoilless gun can operate, all involving the ejection of some kind of counter-mass from the rear of the gun tube to offset the force of the projectile being fired forward. The most basic method, and the first to be employed, is simply making a double-ended gun with a conventional sealed breech, which fires identical projectiles forwards and backwards. Such a system places enormous stress on its midpoint, is extremely cumbersome to reload, and has the highly undesirable effect of launching a projectile potentially just as deadly as the one launched at the enemy at a point behind the shooter where their allies may well be.

The most common system involves venting some portion of the weapon&#x27;s propellant gas to the rear of the tube, in the same fashion as a rocket launcher. This creates a forward directed momentum which is nearly equal to the rearward momentum (recoil) imparted to the system by accelerating the projectile. The balance thus created does not leave much momentum to be imparted to the weapon&#x27;s mounting or the gunner in the form of felt recoil. Since recoil has been mostly negated, a heavy and complex recoil damping mechanism is not necessary. Despite the name, it is rare for the forces to completely balance, and real-world recoilless rifles do recoil noticeably (with varying degrees of severity). Recoilless rifles will not function correctly if the venting system is damaged, blocked, or poorly maintained: in this state, the recoil-damping effect can be reduced or lost altogether, leading to dangerously powerful recoil. Conversely, if a projectile becomes lodged in the barrel for any reason, the entire weapon will be forced forward.

Recoilless rifle rounds for breech-loading reloadable systems resemble conventional cased ammunition, using a driving band to engage the rifled gun tube and spin-stabilize the projectile. The casing of a recoilless rifle round is often perforated to vent the propellant gases, which are then directed to the rear by an expansion chamber surrounding the weapon&#x27;s breech. In the case of single-shot recoilless weapons such as the Panzerfaust or AT4, the device is externally almost identical in design to a single-shot rocket launcher: the key difference is that the launch tube is a gun that launches the projectile using a pre-loaded powder charge, not a hollow tube. Weapons of this type can either encase their projectile inside the disposable gun tube, or mount it on the muzzle: the latter allows the launching of an above-caliber projectile. Like single shot rocket launchers, the need to only survive a single firing means that single-shot recoilless weapons can be made from relatively flimsy and therefore very light materials, such as fiberglass. Recoilless gun launch systems are often used to provide the initial thrust for man-portable weapons firing rocket-powered projectiles: examples include the RPG-7, Panzerfaust 3 and MATADOR.

Since venting propellant gases to the rear can be dangerous in confined spaces, some recoilless guns use a combination of a countershot and captive piston propelling cartridge design to avoid both recoil and backblast. The Armbrust &quot;cartridge,&quot; for example, contains the propellant charge inside a double-ended piston assembly, with the projectile in front, and an equal countermass of shredded plastic to the rear. On firing, the propellant expands rapidly, pushing the pistons outward. This pushes the projectile forwards towards the target and the countermass backwards providing the recoilless effect. The shredded plastic countermass is quickly slowed by air resistance and is harmless at a distance more than a few feet from the rear of the barrel. The two ends of the piston assembly are captured at the ends of the barrel, by which point the propellant gas has expanded and cooled enough that there is no threat of explosion. Other countermass materials that have been used include inert powders and liquids.

==Civilian use==

Obsolete 75 mm M20 and 105 mm M27 recoilless rifles were used by the U.S. National Park Service and the U.S. Forest Service as a system for triggering controlled avalanches at a safe distance, from the early 1950s until the U.S. military&#x27;s inventory of surplus ammunition for these weapons was exhausted in the 1990s. They were then replaced with M40 106 mm recoilless rifles, but following a catastrophic in-bore ammunition explosion that killed one of the five-man gun crew at Alpine Meadows Ski Resort, California, in 1995 and two further in-bore explosions at Mammoth Mountain, California, within thirteen days of each other in December 2002, all such guns were removed from use and replaced with surplus 105 mm howitzers.

<text>USS &quot;Chillicothe&quot; was an ironclad river gunboat of the United States Navy. She was named for the capital of Ohio from 1803 to 1810.

&quot;Chillicothe&quot; was laid down at Cincinnati, Ohio. She was commissioned on 5 September 1862 at Jeffersonville, Indiana, with Acting Lieutenant J. P. Sanford in command. Necessary alterations and repairs and lack of sufficient water to pass over the falls detained her in the Ohio River until early January 1863.

==Service history==
From 8 January 1863, when she sailed from Cairo, Illinois, until the end of the American Civil War, &quot;Chillicothe&quot; was constantly employed in the Mississippi River and its tributaries. She joined in the expeditions to the White River in Arkansas in January 1863 and contributed to the capture of Fort Hindman, Arkansas. She then joined the Yazoo Pass Expedition, from 20 February to 10 April. Coming under enemy&#x27;s fire with in the Yazoo expedition, &quot;Chillicothe&quot; was heavily damaged and lost several men. She was sent to Mound City, Illinois, for repairs and returned to duty on the Mississippi River on 6 September 1863.

On 24 February 1864 she entered the Red River for the expedition of 7 March to 15 May in which her commanding officer, Lieutenant Joseph P. Couthouy, was mortally wounded by rifle fire on 3 April. From 22 May 1864 until 26 May 1865 she lay off Fort Adams, Mississippi, on 8 June 1864 assisting in the capture of a Confederate battery at Simmesport, Louisiana.

&quot;Chillicothe&quot; arrived at Cairo, Illinois, on 13 July 1865, and on 29 November 1865 was sold at auction at Mound City, Illinois. As a civilian-owned ship, she was destroyed by fire in September 1872.

<text>Newtown, a suburb of Sydney&#x27;s inner west, is located approximately four kilometres south-west of the Sydney central business district, straddling the local government areas of the City of Sydney and Inner West Council in the state of New South Wales, Australia.

King Street is the main street of Newtown and centre of commercial and entertainment activity. The street follows the spine of a long ridge that rises up near the University of Sydney and extends to the south, becoming the Princes Highway at its southern end.

Enmore Road branches off King Street towards the suburb of Enmore at Newtown Bridge, where the road passes over the Main Suburban railway line at Newtown railway station. 

Enmore Road and King Street together comprise 9.1 kilometres of over 600 shopfronts. The main shopping strip of Newtown is the longest and most complete commercial precinct of the late Victorian and Federation period in Australia. 

King Street is often referred to as &quot;Eat Street&quot; in the media due to the large number of cafés, pubs and restaurants of various cultures. Cafés, restaurants and galleries can also be found in the streets surrounding King Street.

== History ==

===Aboriginal history===
The area known as Newtown was part of a broader area where the Cadigal tribe of the Eora people lived, who ranged across the entire area from the southern shores of Sydney Harbour to Botany Bay in the south-east and Petersham in the Inner West.

The first indigenous Australian to receive a Christian burial was Tommy, an 11-year-old boy who died of bronchitis in the Sydney Infirmary. He was buried in Camperdown Cemetery, in a section now located outside the wall. The cemetery also contains a sandstone obelisk erected in 1944 by the Rangers League of NSW, in memory of Tommy and three other indigenous Australians buried there: Mogo, William Perry and Wandelina Cabrorigirel, although their graves are no longer identifiable. When the names were transcribed from the records onto the monument, there was an error in deciphering the flowing hand in which many of the original burial dockets were written. It is now known that the fourth name was not &quot;Wandelina Cabrorigirel&quot;, but &quot;Mandelina (Aboriginal).&quot;

King street, Newtown&#x27;s main street, reputedly follows an Aboriginal track that branched out from the main western track, now beneath Broadway and Parramatta Road, and which continued all the way to the coastal plains around Botany Bay. This conflicts with other claims that the main western track was a barrier which divided the land.

===19th century===

Newtown was established as a residential and farming area in the early 19th century. Nicholas Devine, the first principal superintendent of convicts called his property Burren Farm, after a region of County Clare in his native Ireland. Burren Farm would later become parts of Newtown and Macdonaldtown (now Erskineville). 

Some histories say that the Newtown area took its name from a grocery store opened there by John and Margaret Webster in 1832, at a site close to where the Newtown railway station stands today. They placed a sign atop their store that read &quot;New Town Stores&quot;. Captain Sylvester John Browne, father of Thomas Alexander Browne (&quot;Rolf Boldrewood&quot;), built &quot;Newtown House&quot; in the area around the same time, which has also been cited as the source of the name. The name New Town was adopted, at first unofficially, with the space disappearing to form the name Newtown. This account of the origins of the suburb&#x27;s name has been disputed by other historians, given evidence that the names &quot;Newtown&quot; and &quot;New Town&quot; were in use some years before Webster opened his store.

The part of Newtown lying south of King Street was a portion of the two estates granted by Governor Arthur Phillip to the Superintendent of Convicts, Nicholas Devine, in 1794 and 1799. Parts of Macdonaldtown (now Erskineville) and Golden Grove were also once part of Devine&#x27;s grant. In 1827, when Devine was aged about 90, this land was acquired from him by a convict, Bernard Rochford, who sold it to many of Sydney&#x27;s wealthiest and most influential inhabitants, including the mayor. Devine&#x27;s heir, John Devine, a coachbuilder of Birmingham, challenged the will, which was blatantly fraudulent. The &quot;Newtown Ejectment Case&quot; was eventually settled out of court by the payment to Devine of an unknown sum of money said to have been &quot;considerable&quot;. The land was further divided into housing that is now evidenced by the rows of terrace houses and commercial and industrial premises.

Part of the area now falling within the present boundaries of Newtown, north of King Street, was originally part of Camperdown. This area was named by Governor William Bligh, who received it as a land grant in 1806 and passed it to his daughter and son-in-law on his return to England in 1810. In 1848 part of this land was acquired by the Sydney Church of England Cemetery Company to create a general cemetery beyond the boundary of the City of Sydney. Camperdown Cemetery, one block away from King Street, was to become significant in the life of the suburb. Between its consecration in 1849 and its closure to further sales in 1868 it saw 15,000 burials of people from all over Sydney. Of that number, approximately half were paupers buried in unmarked and often communal graves, sometimes as many as 12 in a day during a measles epidemic. Camperdown Cemetery remains, though much reduced in size, as a rare example of mid-19th-century cemetery landscaping. It retains the Cemetery Lodge, a huge fig tree dating from 1848, as well as a number of oak trees of the same date. It survived to become the main green space of Newtown. Among the notable persons buried in the cemetery are explorer-surveyor Sir Thomas Livingstone Mitchell, Major Edmund Lockyer and Mary, Lady Jamison (widow of the colonial pioneer landowner, physician, constitutional reformer and &quot;knight of the realm&quot;, Sir John Jamison), and Eliza Emily Donnithorne, recluse and rumoured inspiration for Miss Havisham. The cemetery also holds the remains of many of the victims of the wreck of the Dunbar in 1857.

From 1845, when the first Anglican church was built on the site of the present Community Centre on Stephen Street, by Edmund Blacket, a number of churches were established, including St Joseph&#x27;s Roman Catholic church in the 1850s, the Methodist church on King Street, now Newtown Mission, and the Baptist church in Church Street. The present St Stephen&#x27;s Anglican church, a fine example of Victorian Gothic architecture, was designed, like its predecessor, by Blacket, and built in the grounds of the cemetery between 1871 and 1880. Both it and the cemetery are on the National Trust register of buildings of national significance. Its Mears and Stainbank carillon is unique in Australia, while its Walker and Sons organ of 1874 is regarded as one of the finest in New South Wales.

On 12 December 1862 the Municipality of Newtown was incorporated and divided into three wards: O&#x27;Connell, Kingston and Enmore, covering . In 1893 a plan was discussed to rename the council area &quot;South Sydney&quot; (as three municipalities North of Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour) had merged to form North Sydney three years earlier), but nothing came of it.

====Housing====

Although there are a few earlier buildings in Newtown, the most rapid development came in the late 19th century, with many former farms and other large properties being subdivided and developed as row-houses, known popularly as &quot;terrace houses&quot;. With their predominance of Victorian-era houses with stuccoed facades, balconies of iron lace and moulded architectural ornaments, many Newtown streets are similar to those of other well-known inner-city suburbs like Glebe, Paddington and Balmain.

From about 1870 onwards, a large proportion of Newtown&#x27;s residents lived in terrace houses of the cheapest possible construction. Many of these terraces were &quot;two-up two-down&quot;, with rear kitchen, some having adjoining walls only one brick thick and a continuous shared roof space. Hundreds of these terrace houses still remain, generally 4 metres (13 ft) wide. It was not uncommon for speculative builders to build a row of these small houses terminating in a house of 1½ width at the corner of the street, this last being a commercial premises, or &quot;corner store&quot;. During the Federation period, single-storey row houses became increasingly common.

This preponderance of small houses is indicative of the working-class employment of most Newtown residents, many of whom worked in the city or at local shops, factories, warehouses, brickyards and at the nearby Eveleigh Railway Workshops. Retail and service trades dominated the suburb increasingly throughout this period, with tradesmen and shopkeepers together accounting for 70–75% of the working population. During the late 19th century and early 20th century, Newtown prospered, so much so that in the &quot;Jubilee Souvenir of the Municipality of Newtown&quot;, published in 1912, it was described as &quot;one of the most wealthy suburbs around Sydney&quot;.

A number of imposing Victorian mansions were built on larger estates, as well as rows of larger and more stylish terrace houses in certain areas such as Georgina Street in North Newtown and Holmwood Street in South Newtown. As in many other historic areas of Sydney, some of the largest and most important houses, such as &quot;Erskine Villa&quot; (formerly on Erskineville Road, and which gave its name to the suburb of Erskineville), were demolished and the estates subdivided. Another loss was the home of Mary Reibey in Station Street, which was acquired by the Department of Housing in 1964, demolished in 1967, and replaced with an 8-story public housing tower block. Only the cottage of Reibey&#x27;s dairyman survives, a little further down the street.

One of the most impressive surviving sets of 19th-century housing in Newtown is the imposing terrace of five elegant five-storey mansions running along Warren Ball Avenue in North Newtown, facing onto Hollis Park.

From the late 19th century onwards, the Newtown area became a major commercial and industrial centre. King Street developed into a thriving retail precinct and the area was soon dotted with factories, workshops, warehouses and commercial and retail premises of all kinds and sizes. Several major industries were established in the greater Newtown area from the late 19th century, including the Eveleigh Railway Workshops, the IXL jam and preserves factory in North Newtown/Darlington, the St Peters brickworks and the Fowler Potteries in Camperdown.

====Public housing====

Newtown is home to some public housing pockets built throughout the late 1960s to the 1970s, mainly consisting of unit complexes with walk-up apartments, extensive townhouses and tower blocks closely built together on small blocks of land, resided by the suburbs 1000 social housing tenants. These housing complexes dominate the housing stock on some of Newtown streets.

The large housing estates gradually shrunk as many of the homes were demolished and or reverted to private ownership as the surrounding area slowly went through gentrification.

Most complexes were built with Radburn principles, with prefabricated walk-up flats and apartment blocks accessed by communal pathways and courtyards separated from roads, creating densely populated concentrations of disadvantage. The Radburn design has been widely criticised in outer-suburbs estates, allegedly contributing to some fire hazards and social problems with isolated areas giving local criminals a place to commit crime and evade motorised patrols.

Homes in these areas are owned by either the Department of Housing or the Aboriginal Housing Office. The complexes take up a significant amount of Newtown’s Indigenous Australian population.

The SA1 covering the Golden Grove housing estate according to the 2016 census, is the suburbs most economically/socially disadvantaged.

Department of Housing sites in Newtown:

8 Prefabricated terraces, 7 walk-up flats, 250–350 residents. Alice Street/Camden Street

9 Prefabricated walk-up flats, 75–120 residents. Alice Street/Hawken Street corner

13 Prefabricated walk-up flats, 1 6-story tower block, 300–500 residents. Forbes Street/Golden Grove Street/Darlington Road

1 9-story tower block, numerous Victorian terrace houses, 170–240 residents. Station Street/Reiby Lane corner

As well as numerous Victorian terrace houses and walk-up flat developments scattered around the suburbs streets.

===Early 20th century===
Although it prospered in the late 19th century, during the first half of the 20th century, and especially during the Depression, like many inner-city Sydney suburbs such as Glebe and Paddington, the area became increasingly run down as wealthy Sydneysiders preferred to settle in newer and more prestigious areas. In 1949, Newtown was incorporated into the City of Sydney.

===Mid-20th century===

Newtown was originally a relatively prosperous suburb, the legacy of which is the numerous lavish Victorian mansions still standing in the area. However, many parts of Newtown had gradually become a working-class enclave, and for much of the 20th century, Newtown was a low-income blue-collar suburb, often denigrated as a slum. In the post-war period, the low rents and house prices attracted newly arrived European migrants, and Newtown&#x27;s population changed radically, becoming home to a sizeable migrant community.

In 1968, a controversial redistribution of local government boundaries by the Askin state Liberal government saw part of Newtown become part of Marrickville Council. From the 1970s, as the post-war population prospered, raised families and aged, many moved to outlying suburbs to build larger houses, resulting in a supply of relatively cheap terrace houses and cottages entered the rental market. Because of its proximity to the expanding University of Sydney and the Sydney central business district, along with the comparatively low rents, Newtown began to attract university students in the 1960s and 1970s. The area became a centre for student share-households in Sydney and the development of cafés, pubs and restaurants made it a mecca for many young people. Newtown gained a reputation as a bohemian centre and the gay and lesbian population also increased.

===Late 20th century and early 21st century===
The 1980s was the period that probably saw the greatest diversity in Newtown. At this time, cheap housing was still available. During the 1990s many long-established businesses closed, including Brennan&#x27;s Department Store, a charming old-fashioned department store founded in the 19th century, and one of the last relics of the heyday of Victorian commerce in Newtown.

Many homes have been restored and remain examples of 19th-century architecture in Sydney. Like other similar inner-Sydney suburbs (most notably Paddington and Glebe), gentrification has led to another shift in Newtown&#x27;s demographics. From the 1970s onwards, many major industrial and commercial sites in the area were closed or vacated. Many of these former commercial sites have since been redeveloped as housing such as the Alpha House and Beta House apartment complexes on King Street, which were formerly both multi-storey warehouses. Prior to becoming apartments, Alpha and Beta house became two artist warehouses that accommodated the birthing of many national and international performing arts companies and artists. One such company, &quot;Legs on the Wall&quot;, was created in Beta House.

==Heritage listings==
Newtown has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* 187–189 Church Street: St Stephen&#x27;s Anglican Church
* 15 Carillon Avenue: The Women&#x27;s College building
* Great Southern and Western railway: Newtown railway station and Newtown Tram Depot
* 69–77 King Street: Trocadero
* 280a King Street: Newtown Mission Uniting Church

==Transport==

===Rail===
Newtown railway station is on the Leppington &amp; Inner West Line and Liverpool &amp; Inner West Line of the Sydney Trains network. The station opened in 1855, as one of the original four intermediate stations on the Sydney to Parramatta railway line (the others being Ashfield, Burwood and Homebush), and it was soon serviced by ten steam trains a day. In 1878 the station was moved from Station Street to its current location by the fork of King Street and Enmore Road.

Until the 1960s, when trams were phased out in Sydney, Newtown was a major hub for train-tram transfers; several regular electric tram services were centred there and the old Newtown Tram Depot (long vacant and now largely derelict) still stands next to the station. The long-abandoned former office buildings of the tram depot (adjacent to the current station entrance) were renovated during the renovation and rebuilding of Newtown Station and how house a café and restaurant. This extensive renovation, completed in 2012, greatly improved commuter access to the station platforms (which lie in a deep cutting under King Street) including additional stairways and a disabled-accessible elevator, although the renovation works and the layout of the new station entrance blocked the old tram-line entry way into the tram sheds, effectively cutting off direct vehicular access from King St into the tram sheds (which still lie vacant and derelict as of mid-2017).

===Buses===
Transdev John Holland and Transit Systems operate buses through Newtown. The trams were replaced by bus services that inherited the old route numbers – 422, 426, 428 – and follow the old tram routes that run along King Street and Enmore Road, going inwards to the city and outwards to Tempe, Dulwich Hill and Canterbury, respectively. Since then the 423 service from the city to Kingsgrove Bus Depot via Newtown has been added. There is also the 352 service that goes east through Surry Hills to Bondi Junction and the 370 service running north to the University of Sydney and Glebe Point and south-east to the University of New South Wales and Coogee.

==Education==
In the 1990s, Newtown High School was chosen by the NSW Department of Education as the site for a new specialised performing arts high school, which would combine traditional academic subjects with music and theatrical performance education. The school was renamed Newtown High School of the Performing Arts. Prior to becoming Newtown High School, it was Newtown Junior Technical School (the &quot;tech&quot;) that educated boys from 1st Year to 3rd Year at the end of which they gained the Intermediate Certificate unless they had already left school at the age of 15. Girls of the same age group were educated in the southern part of Newtown Public School. The primary public school was segregated with the boys part facing Newman St opposite the tannery works that often omitted obnoxious odours.&#x27; (From &quot;Prior to...odours&quot; it is based on personal knowledge through living in Newtown and attending those schools.)

Primary and infants school include:
* Australia Street Infants School
* Bridge Road School, Camperdown 
* Camdenville Public School
* Newtown Public School
* North Newtown Public School
* St Joseph&#x27;s College (defunct)

Private schools in the area include the Athena School.

The University of Sydney&#x27;s Centre for Continuing Education provides adult education open to the general public.

==Landmarks==

===Pubs===
In part because of its industrial and commercial history, the Newtown area contains many pubs. These include a number of late-Victorian establishments and several in an Art Deco style from the mid-20th century. In July 2000, one of these, &quot;The Marlborough&quot;, called by historian Chrys Meader &quot;the Gateway to Newtown&quot; because of its visually commanding appearance at a wide intersection of King Street and Missenden Road, was stripped of all its original Art Deco tiles and had its upper floor substantially damaged before protests to the council prevented this being taken further.

===The Trocadero===
One of the major architectural conservation projects in Newtown in recent years has been the restoration of the Trocadero dance hall in King Street North. This large entertainment venue opened in 1889 and is one of the last 19th-century dance halls still standing in Sydney. Over the years it functioned variously as a dance hall, a skating rink, a cinema, a boxing and vaudeville venue, a bicycle factory and a motor body works.

From 1920 onward it was owned by the Grace Bros retail company, and several sections were leased out as shops or accommodation. For many years the shopfront on the northern side of the building housed Maurice&#x27;s Lebanese Restaurant, commemorated in John Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;On King St, I&#x27;m A King&quot;. The building was purchased by Moore Theological College in 1974, and from 1981 to 1994 it housed the Con Dellis used furniture store, but all occupation ceased after that time. Fortunately, a sympathetic restoration program during 2005–06 by Moore College has returned this outstanding 19th-century building, including its elaborate Flemish-style facade, to its former glory.

===Burland Hall===
One Newtown landmark that has undergone many changes during the 20th century is the site of the former Burland Community Hall, on King St. In the early 20th century the site was occupied by the original Hub Theatre. From the mid-20th century it was occupied by an Art Deco-style cinema operated by the Hoyts cinema chain. In the mid-1960s the cinema was converted into a community hall and it was renamed Burland Community Hall in 1965. For years it was the venue for community events such as dances, concerts, film screenings, meetings, parties, wedding receptions and a community market. In 1986 its upper floor was taken over for the Newtown branch of the City of Sydney Library network, following the decision by Marrickville Council to close its Newtown library branch due to budgetary constraints. In 1995 the library moved to new premises in the former Salvation Army Citadel in nearby Brown Street, and Burland Hall was redeveloped into offices and retail premises.

===Hub Theatre===
One of the most notable local landmarks is the Hub Theatre opposite Newtown Station, next to the old Newtown Town Hall. The original Hub stood at, before moving to its present location, on the site of an earlier vaudeville theatre. It was converted to a cinema in the 1930. From the early 1970s, with the relaxation of Australia&#x27;s censorship laws, it was used to screen pornographic films and stage live &quot;adult&quot; sex shows, including the long running &quot;Little French Maid&quot;. The Hub closed as a &quot;porno&quot; venue in the early 1990s and has been mostly vacant ever since; the owners of the Dendy chain tried to secure the venue for its Newtown cinema but were unsuccessful. Recently, the Hub has been home to live comedy shows and other such performances, seeing a rejuvenation of the building. 

== Culture ==

=== Live music ===

Newtown has been a hub for live entertainment since the late 19th century. During the 1980s the many pubs in the area housed a thriving live music scene, notably the Sandringham in King Street. One of the best-known Australian bands to emerge from this scene was The Whitlams, who held down a formative residency at &quot;The Sando&quot; for several years. Musician John Kennedy wrote a tribute to the area in the mid-1980s. His single &quot;King Street&quot; name-checked familiar Newtown landmarks and local figures of the time, including &quot;The Wire Man&quot; (a local eccentric who collected wire and wire coat hangers), Maurice&#x27;s Lebanese restaurant, and the Coles New World supermarket, which occupied the site of the current Dendy Cinema.

Throughout the 1990s it was particularly known as a centre for indie rock, with the suburb home to many musicians and several live venues. In the late nineties it boasted a handful of popular venues: Goldmans / Newtown RSL, The Globe, Feedback and The Sandringham, all of which had closed by the late 1990s. After its takeover by Petersham RSL Club, the former Newtown RSL reopened as a music venue under the name of @Newtown but closed in January 2011 due to financial losses.

Live music returned to the Sandringham Hotel in 2005, and in 2014 it reopened as the Newtown Social Club, hosting music in an upstairs performance space. However, in July 2017 the Newtown Social Club closed and the venue reopened as Holey Moley, a licensed 18-hole mini-golf course designed to give punters &quot;good content for Instagram&quot;, according to its developers. Another recent addition to Newtown&#x27;s live music scene is the small live venue &quot;Leadbelly&quot; (formerly &quot;The Vanguard&quot;) at the north end of King Street, and the continuing popularity of the lyric-sized Enmore Theatre.

=== Theatre ===
Newtown and its surrounding areas have the highest concentration of independent theatres and live performance spaces in Sydney. Theatres currently operating include: 
* New Theatre, formed in 1932 and is Australia&#x27;s oldest continuously performing theatre.
* Enmore Theatre on Enmore Road
* the Newtown High School of the Performing Arts

In the 1970s and 1980s many theatres, cinemas and music venues in the Sydney CBD were demolished. Due to the lack of &quot;lyric&quot;-sized venues, the Enmore Theatre in Enmore Road has become one of the busiest medium-sized concert venues in Sydney.

In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Newtown was home to several popular theatres. Some of their buildings are still standing and some have been demolished. The Trocadero staged theatre and vaudeville in the early 20th century. The Hub, originally known as Clay’s Bridge Theatre, opened in 1913 and staged vaudeville acts and other performances. Other theatres from this era included Fullers&#x27; Majestic Theatre (from 1955 known as the Elizabethan Theatre) on the corner of Wilson Street and Erskineville Road, St George&#x27;s Hall at 352 King Street, Manchester Unity Hall (previously Oddfellows Hall) at 12-14 Enmore Road, and the Enmore Theatre, built in 1908.

===Festivals===
Newtown hosts a number of annual festivals.
The Newtown Festival was a community festival of free live music, events, workshops and stalls that was held annually from 1978 to 2019. Held in Camperdown Memorial Park next to St. Stephen&#x27;s Church, Newtown. The purpose of the festival was to raise funds for the Newtown Neighbourhood Centre, an association that provides services to non-English speakers, the aged, disabled or poor.

Feastability, Newtown&#x27;s Food and Wine Festival, showcases the eclectic international cuisines of the suburb along with Australian wine, local pubs and brewers, bakers and confectioners. The festival, which is held on the last Sunday of each September, started in the mid-1990s as six stalls outside the Hub. It now takes place in the grounds of Newtown School of Performing Arts, has more than 40 stalls and features all-day entertainment from musicians and artists, as well as kids&#x27; activities. The festival is organised by Marrickville Council.

Under the Blue Moon Festival was an alternative community festival also held in September. The event had a variety of entertainment; live music, discussions, street performances, fashion shows and other subculture presentations, especially those of the Goth community. Local business and special interest groups provided a diverse variety of entertainment, including a local alternative hairdresser and even the local mortuary with a display of coffins.

Sydney Fringe festival is a three-week alternative arts festival that was held for the first time in September 2010 at venues in Newtown, Enmore and Marrickville. It is a project of the Newtown Entertainment Precinct Association.

=== Sport ===

Newtown Rugby League Football Club—the &quot;Newtown Jets&quot;—is Australia&#x27;s oldest existing rugby league club, formed in 1908 at the Newtown Town Hall. They compete in the NSW Cup competition, a tier below the NRL&#x27;s national premiership, having left the top grade after the 1983 season. Their home ground is Henson Park, Marrickville.

===Film and television===
In the late 1960s, the Australian TV drama series &quot;You Can&#x27;t See Round Corners&quot; starred Rowena Wallace and Ken Shorter as a draft dodger hiding out in Newtown. The TV series was based on Jon Cleary&#x27;s novel of the same name, which is set in 1940s Paddington. When the decision was made to set the TV series in the 1960s, scriptwriter Richard Lane moved the action to Newtown because Paddington by the 1960s was considered too gentrified, while Newtown was still an &quot;industrial suburb&quot;.

In the mid-1980s, the Spanish Mission-style service station on King Street was used as a location for scenes in the Ray Lawrence film &quot;Bliss&quot;, which was based on the novel by Peter Carey. In the film, the service station was used as the childhood home of Harry Joy&#x27;s wife Bettina, played by Lynette Curran.

&quot;Erskineville Kings&quot; (1999), directed by Alan White and starring Hugh Jackman, features extensive use of locations in Newtown and Erskineville, including a scene shot in Gould&#x27;s Book Arcade.

&quot;Garage Days&quot; (2002) directed by Alex Proyas, depicts a fictional indie rock band based in Newtown.

The ABC television drama &quot;Love Is a Four Letter Word&quot;, starring musician-actor Peter Fenton and featuring live bands each episode, included extensive location shooting at the Courthouse Hotel in Australia Street.

St Stephen&#x27;s Church and Camperdown Cemetery have regularly been used as sites for filming movies, TV and videos, notably in &quot;Priscilla, Queen of the Desert&quot;.

The 2012 romantic comedy &quot;Not Suitable for Children&quot;, directed by Peter Templeman, was filmed in Newtown and surrounding suburbs.

In 2013, Sydney band Sticky Fingers filmed the music video for their song &quot;Australia Street&quot; on King Street.

In 2014, the British alternative rock band Coldplay featured the town in the music video for their single &quot;A Sky Full Of Stars&quot;.

=== Literature ===

The first municipal library in New South Wales was established in Newtown in 1868 in the Newtown School of Arts building at the corner of Australia and King Streets. Today, as well as the Newtown Library run by the City of Sydney, the suburb is home to The Women&#x27;s Library, a feminist library established in 1992.

Newtown is home to many bookshops, including Gould&#x27;s Book Arcade (founded in 1967 by activist Bob Gould), Better Read than Dead, Elizabeth&#x27;s Bookshop, Modern Times and Parliament on King. Anarchist bookshop Black Rose Books, established in 1982, has occupied several sites in Newtown including its current location on Enmore Road.

Many publishing houses have been active in Newtown over the years. Walker Books, Vagabond Press, Darlington Press and Sydney University Press are currently based in the Newtown area; Newtown publishers of the past include Neptune Press, Camperdown Press, Millennium Books and Leftbank Publishing. The &quot;Newtown Review of Books&quot;, a literary journal established in 2012 by Jean Bedford and Linda Funnell, has published essays about the suburb by the crime writer Peter Corris.

==== Newtown in fiction ====
One of the first pieces of fiction to be published in colonial Sydney was &quot;The Legend of Newtown&quot; by future member of parliament D.H. Deneihy, published in the Sydney &quot;Sentinel&quot; on 5 November 1845 when the author was 17. It described Newtown as &quot;a favourite place ... to snatch a mouthful of fresh air, a view of the ruralities of the place&quot;.

The famous Newtown recluse and eccentric Eliza Emily Donnithorne (1826–1886) is said by some sources to have inspired the character of Miss Havisham in Charles Dickens&#x27; novel &quot;Great Expectations&quot;. Donnithorne lived in Cambridge House (later known as Camperdown Lodge and since demolished) at 36 King Street, Newtown from about 1836 until her death in 1886. She is buried at Camperdown cemetery.

Dorothy Hewett&#x27;s 1959 novel &quot;Bobbin&#x27; Up&quot; includes a description of the dance halls and night life of King Street in the 1950s. &quot;The House that Was Eureka&quot; by Nadia Wheatley (1985) is set in a row of Newtown terrace houses in 1931 and 1981, both periods of economic downturn and high unemployment in the suburb.

More recently, Sandra Leigh Price&#x27;s 2015 novel &quot;The Bird&#x27;s Child&quot; is set in bohemian Newtown in 1929. &quot;Dark Fires Shall Burn&quot;, a 2016 crime novel by Anna Westbrook, is set in Newtown in 1946. The verse novel &quot;Newtown Voices&quot; by Sue Cartledge (2017) describes Newtown in 1978. &quot;The Blank Page&quot; by John Dale (1987) features a cameo by the Marlborough Hotel on King Street.

==== Newtown in poetry ====
Poems about Newtown include &quot;Laminex&quot; by John Tranter, &quot;Newtown Pastoral&quot; by Gig Ryan, &quot;On the Road&quot; by S.K. Kelen, &quot;Thread Drift&quot; by Pam Brown, &quot;Greek Cheeses&quot; and &quot;To a Runner Dressed in Black&quot; by Adam Aiken, &quot;King Street Newtown&quot; by Alison Clark, &quot;Autumn in Newtown&quot; by Christopher Kelen, the 1994 collection &quot;Wildlife in Newtown&quot; by Colleen Burke, and &quot;An Ordinary Evening in Newtown&quot; by Laurie Duggan.

==== Newtown in children&#x27;s literature ====
Children&#x27;s literature set in Newtown includes &quot;My Place&quot; and &quot;Five Times Dizzy and Dancing in the Anzac Deli&quot; by Nadia Wheatley and &quot;Lara of Newtown&quot; by Chris McKimmie.

===Graffiti and street art===

The Newtown area is also known for its creative graffiti and &quot;street art&quot;. The most prominent of these works are the large murals created in the late 1980s and early 1990s, which were painted on the walls of houses and shops in the area. Spray-painted &quot;tags&quot; have proliferated all over the area in recent years, although more recently the style of tagging has become far more elaborate than the simple spray-can signatures that litter walls throughout the district.

Examples include a mural of American civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. on King Street (painted by Andrew Aiken (Seems) and Juilee Pryor), the &quot;Great Wave&quot; mural in Gowrie Street, the &quot;Three Proud People&quot; mural (a reproduction of a photo taken at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics), and the &quot;map of Africa&quot; mural in King Street.

Since 2014, the Inner West Council (and its predecessor, Marrickville Council) have managed the &quot;Perfect Match&quot; initiative, which pairs artists with residents and business owners to create large-scale paintings in public spaces. As of 2024, over 160 artworks have been produced through the initiative, including in Newtown.

=== Gay and lesbian culture ===
According to the 2011 census, Newtown, St Peters and Erskineville had the highest proportions of same-sex couples. The gay and lesbian community of Newtown also extends into neighbouring Glebe, Leichhardt, Annandale, Marrickville, Enmore and Dulwich Hill. The area was home to two of Sydney’s most well-established gay and lesbian pubs, the Newtown Hotel on King Street and the nearby Imperial Hotel in Erskineville Road (the famous drag show pub featured in the movie &quot;Priscilla, Queen of the Desert&quot;). The owners of the Newtown Hotel abruptly terminated negotiations for lease renewal and locked the licence-owner out of the premises in November 2007. The bar reopened in late 2010, under the name &#x27;Freaky Tiki&#x27;. After renovations in 2010, it has reopened and reclaimed its original name, The Newtown Hotel, and currently offers a general, non-specific clientele, in common with most bars in the area. The Imperial also closed in 2007 for renovations but did not reopen until 2010, following a protracted and expensive licensing battle with the local council. As of 2019, The Imperial hosts queer parties on Thursday nights.

One bar formerly known as Zanzibar had a loyal lesbian following but it rebranded as Websters Bar, with a general clientele in 2016. Wednesday nights are especially popular for lesbians as the upstairs bar at The Bank Hotel hosts nights for queer women.

Since 2018, rapid gentrification of the area and Sydney&#x27;s introduction of the CBD lockout laws, which Newtown is excluded from, has seen much of the LGBTQ+ scene pushed into neighbouring areas. Also as a result, homophobic violence has risen in the area.

The Gay and Lesbian Counselling Service in Newtown provides free telephone counselling for gays and lesbians living in NSW, as well as Twenty 10, a support organisation for young gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, same-sex attracted and gender-questioning people who are under 26 and having problems at home or have recently become homeless.

As per 2021 Census, the majority of Newtown residents were born in Australia (64.5%). Other countries of birth for residents include England (5.7%), New Zealand (2.7%), China (1.5%) and the USA (1.4%). Smaller but significant groups from diverse ethnic backgrounds further contribute to the multicultural character of Newtown, marking the suburb as a microcosm of global cultures within Sydney&#x27;s vibrant urban landscape.

The residents of Newtown enjoy an above-average lifestyle, with a median weekly household income of $2,024, significantly higher than the national median.

== Governance ==

=== Local ===
Newtown is divided between Inner West Council and City of Sydney local government areas.

===State===

Newtown was predominantly in the State electoral district of Marrickville, which was represented by the then deputy Premier Andrew Refshauge until his resignation on 10 August 2005. The resulting by-election, held on 17 September 2005 was won by Carmel Tebbutt. Prior to the 2015 NSW State Election, the electoral district of Newtown was recreated, which had previously existed but had been abolished after the 1950 election. Newtown now resides in this district.
===Federal===
Federally, Newtown lies partly in the electorate of Grayndler, represented by Anthony Albanese of the ALP, and partly in the electorate of Sydney, represented by Tanya Plibersek, also of the ALP.

Both electorates saw strong Green votes in the 2001 election, and it was expected the Green candidates, rather than the Liberal Party, would provide the main opposition to the ALP in the 2004 election, although the Liberals ultimately did narrowly retain their lead over the Greens in these electorates.

<text>The Invisible Woman (Susan &quot;Sue&quot; Storm-Richards) is a superheroine appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot; #1 (November 1961). Susan Storm is a founding member of the Fantastic Four and was the first female superhero published by Marvel during the Silver Age of Comic Books.

Sue Storm received her powers by being exposed to a cosmic storm, and was known as Invisible Girl during her early years with the team. After being brainwashed at some point, she decides to change her identity from then onward to reflect a more confident version of herself. As a human mutate, she possesses two powers: invisibility and force fields. Her invisibility power deals with bending light waves and allows her to render herself and other objects invisible. She can also project powerful fields of invisible psionic, hyperspace-based energy that she uses for a variety of offensive and defensive effects, including shields, blasts, explosions, and levitation. Sue plays a central role in the lives of her hot-headed younger brother Johnny Storm, her brilliant husband Reed Richards, her close friend Ben Grimm, and her children (Franklin and Valeria). She was also romantically attracted to Namor the Sub-Mariner for a time.

Invisible Woman has been described as one of Marvel&#x27;s most notable and powerful female heroes.

Invisible Woman was portrayed by Rebecca Staab in the unreleased 1994 film &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot;, Jessica Alba in the 2005 film &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; and its 2007 sequel &quot;Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer&quot;, Kate Mara in the 2015 film &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;, and will be played by Vanessa Kirby in the 2025 Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;The Fantastic Four: First Steps&quot;, the 2026 film &quot;&quot;, and the 2027 film &quot;&quot;.

==Publication history==

Created by writer Stan Lee and artist/co-writer Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot; #1 (November 1961).

Since Stan Lee wanted &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot; to be driven by familial connections rather than action, the primary impetus for Susan Storm&#x27;s creation was to not only be a full member of the team, but also the female lead (with Reed Richards a.k.a. Mister Fantastic being the male lead) of the series. He eventually emphasized this to readers explicitly, with a story in which the Fantastic Four read fan mail denigrating the Invisible Girl&#x27;s value to the team, and respond by enumerating some of the occasions on which she played a key role in their victories. Teammate Johnny Storm a.k.a. the Human Torch being Sue&#x27;s little brother became one of several sources of tension within the group, and she also served as the center of a love triangle with Reed and the Fantastic Four&#x27;s sometime ally, sometime enemy Namor. Sue was initially presented as the sole reason for Ben Grimm, a bad guy, remaining on the group, which was significantly toned down in the published series.

Lee did not want Sue to have super strength, &quot;to be Wonder Woman and punch people&quot;, so eventually he came to invisibility, inspired by works such as Universal Pictures&#x27; &quot;The Invisible Man&quot;. His original two-page plot summary for the first issue of &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot;, reprinted in the &quot;Marvel Masterworks&quot; and &quot;Marvel Epic Collection&quot; editions of the first ten issues, handled Susan&#x27;s powers similarly to &quot;The Invisible Man&quot;, which required her to take off her clothes, but noting concern that that might be &quot;too sexy&quot; for a comic book. It also noted that she could not turn visible again, and would wear a mask recreating her face when she wanted to be seen. By the time the first issue was written and drawn, both elements had changed: Susan could turn invisible and visible at will, and doing so affected the visibility of whatever clothing she was wearing.

Invisible Woman has primarily appeared in issues of &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;. In issue 22 (January 1964), the creators expanded Sue&#x27;s abilities, giving her the powers to render other objects and people invisible and create strong force fields and psionic blasts. Under John Byrne&#x27;s authorship, Sue became more confident and assertive in her abilities, which became more versatile and impressive. She finds she can use her force field abilities to manipulate matter through the air, immobilize enemies, or administer long-range attacks. Susan changed her &quot;nom de guerre&quot; to Invisible Woman.

In April 2019, Marvel Comics announced that it will publish Sue Storm&#x27;s first solo miniseries, &quot;Invisible Woman.&quot; It was written by Mark Waid, drawn by Mattia De Iulis with covers by Adam Hughes. It was later confirmed by Tom Brevoort, editor at Marvel Comics, that the miniseries was produced for trademark purposes.

==Fictional character biography==
As detailed in &quot;The Marvel Saga: Official History of The Marvel Universe #16&quot;, Susan Storm, and her younger brother, Jonathan grew up in the town of Glenville, Long Island, children of the physician Franklin Storm and his wife Mary. The parents left their kids alone one night to travel to a dinner honoring Dr. Storm. On the way, a tire blew out and Mary was injured. Franklin escaped injury and insisted on operating on his wife. He was unable to save her. After his wife&#x27;s death, Dr. Franklin Storm became a gambler and a drunk, losing his medical practice, which led him to the accidental killing of a loan shark. Franklin did not defend himself in court, because he still felt guilty over Mary&#x27;s death. With their father in prison, Susan had to become a mother figure for her younger brother.

While living with her aunt, Susan, at the young age of 17, met her future husband, Reed Richards, a house guest who was attending college. When she graduated from high school as the award-winning captain of her Girls&#x27; Varsity Swim Team, she moved to California to attend college, where she pursued an acting career and encountered Richards again. They began to become romantically involved with each other.

Reed Richards, working in the field of aerospace engineering, was designing a spacecraft for interstellar travel. Everything was going well until the government stopped the funding of his project. Richards, wanting to see his project through, decided to make an unscheduled test flight. It was only going to be Reed and his best friend, Ben Grimm, involved, but Susan was instrumental in persuading Reed in letting her brother and herself join them on the dangerous space mission. In space, the quartet was exposed to massive amounts of cosmic radiation. As a result, they had to abort the mission and return to Earth. After the crash landing, they realized that they gained superhuman powers; hers was the ability to become invisible at will. Realizing the potential use of their abilities, the four of them became the Fantastic Four, for the benefit of mankind. Susan adopted the code name Invisible Girl.

===Invisible Girl===

As the Fantastic Four, the team set up their first headquarters in the Baxter Building in Manhattan. The Fantastic Four encounter many villains in the early part of their career, but none of them contend for Susan&#x27;s affections more than Namor the Sub-Mariner. Sue feels an amount of attraction to Namor, but her heart belongs with Reed, a situation that has been called the Marvel Universe&#x27;s first love triangle.

Initially, her powers are limited to making herself invisible. However, before long Sue discovers she can make other things invisible as well as create force fields of invisible energy. After Susan is injured in battle with the Mole Man, her father escapes from prison and operates on her to save her life. Franklin makes amends with his children before returning to prison; however, the Super-Skrull finds a way to kidnap Dr. Storm, mimic his appearance, and then fight the Fantastic Four as the Invincible Man. In the process of defeating the Super-Skrull, Dr. Storm sacrifices his own life to protect the Fantastic Four from a Skrull booby trap.

Reed and Sue&#x27;s relationship progresses, with the two of them deciding to get married. The wedding is the event of the century, with several of New York City&#x27;s preeminent superheroes in attendance. Not long after that, Sue and the Fantastic Four encounter Galactus and the Silver Surfer. Sue later becomes pregnant with her first child. As a result, she takes time off as an active member of the team. Johnny&#x27;s girlfriend, the Inhuman elementalist Crystal, joins the team, taking over Susan&#x27;s roster spot.

Susan&#x27;s cosmic ray irradiated blood cells serve as an obstacle for her in carrying the unborn child to term. Knowing this, Reed, Johnny, and Ben journey into the Negative Zone to acquire the Cosmic Control Rod from Annihilus. Effectively utilizing the device, the baby is safely delivered and is named Franklin, in memory of Susan and Johnny&#x27;s father. Due to the genetically altered structure of his parents, Franklin is a mutant, possessing vast powers. Seeking to use the boy&#x27;s talents for his own sadistic purposes, Annihilus triggers a premature full release of Franklin&#x27;s latent abilities, which were already in the process of gradual emergence. Fearing that his son could release enough psionic energy to eliminate all life on Earth, Reed shuts down Franklin&#x27;s mind. Angry with Reed for not seeking her input in the matter, Susan leaves the Fantastic Four and has a marital separation from Reed. Medusa of the Inhumans takes her roster spot. With the help of Namor, Susan reconciles with Reed and returns to the Fantastic Four accompanied by Franklin.

===Invisible Woman===

Susan eventually becomes pregnant for a second time. However, this second child is stillborn due to Susan having been exposed to radiation inside the Negative Zone. A depressed Susan is manipulated by Psycho-Man into becoming Malice. As Malice, Susan attacks her friends and family in the Fantastic Four, utilizing her abilities at power levels she had never displayed previously. Reed saves Susan by forcing her to hate him legitimately. Susan (off-panel) does something to Psycho-Man, causing him to let out a terrifying scream. After she rejoins her teammates, Susan states that Psycho-Man will never hurt anyone ever again. Susan is profoundly affected by the entire episode, and changes her code name from &quot;Invisible Girl&quot; to &quot;Invisible Woman&quot;. Along with Reed, she briefly leaves the Fantastic Four and joins the Avengers. The two of them rejoin the Fantastic Four before long.

During the Infinity War, Susan faces off against Malice, who has reemerged in her subconscious. Susan absorbs Malice into her own consciousness. Subsequently, Susan&#x27;s personality is influenced by Malice, causing her to become more aggressive in battle, even creating invisible razor-like force fields she uses to slice enemies. Her son Franklin, who has traveled forward and back in time, becomes the adult hero Psi-Lord, frees his mother, and absorbs the influence of Malice into himself. He eventually defeats Malice by projecting her into the mind of the Dark Raider, an insane alternate universe counterpart of Reed Richards who later dies in the Negative Zone.

After the apparent death of Reed, Susan becomes a capable leader. Susan keeps searching for Reed, feeling he is still alive, despite romantic advances from her old flame, Namor the Sub-Mariner. The Fantastic Four eventually rescue the time-displaced Reed, who finds himself temporarily losing confidence in his leadership skills, since Susan is also a capable leader.

Following their return to their Earth of origin, the Fantastic Four encounter Valeria von Doom. This new Marvel Girl came from an alternate future, where she was the child of Susan and Doctor Doom. Susan eventually comes to accept the young girl as a friend. During a conflict with Abraxas, Franklin reveals that he used his abilities to save Susan&#x27;s original stillborn child and place it in another alternate future. After the ordeal involving Abraxas, Marvel Girl is restored to a baby again inside Susan&#x27;s womb. Susan again has a difficult birthing. Due to the help of Doctor Doom, Susan gives birth to a healthy baby girl, which Doom names Valeria, his price for helping Sue. Doom places a spell on the baby, which makes her his familiar spirit, to be used against the Fantastic Four. The Fantastic Four wrestle Valeria free from Doom&#x27;s control and defeat him.

===Sue, the Human Torch===
Zius, leader of a group of Galactus refugees, kidnaps Susan. His intent was to use her powers to hide planets from Galactus. Reed finds a way to fool Zius, by switching Susan and Johnny&#x27;s powers. Susan assists in an adventure where Johnny becomes a herald of Galactus. Wielding a cosmic version of her powers, Johnny is able to see through people to the very cores of their personality.

Both Sue and Johnny gain a newfound respect for each other and how they deal with their powers. Soon, Reed tries to switch the powers back. The entire FF&#x27;s powers are granted to four random civilians before being restored to their rightful wielders.

This parallels an earlier torture by Doom, where Sue was given an extremely painful version of Johnny&#x27;s pyrokinetic ability.

===Anti-registration movement===
During the 2006–07 storyline &quot;Civil War&quot;, which takes place in the aftermath of an explosion in a residential neighborhood in Stamford, Connecticut, and prompting calls for the government to register people with superhuman abilities, Sue&#x27;s brother Johnny is beaten up by locals angered by his celebrity superhero status. Although Sue is initially part of the pro-registration side supporting the Superhuman Registration Act, she defects after the Thor clone, created by her husband Mister Fantastic and Tony Stark, kills Bill Foster. Sue leaves the Baxter Building, informing Reed via a note that their children are in his care, as she intends to join Captain America&#x27;s underground resistance force. Her final injunction to her husband is a heartfelt request: &quot;Please fix this.&quot;

The Storm siblings narrowly escape a team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents bent on capturing them in &quot;Civil War&quot; #5. The two further elude detection by operating under fake husband and wife identities provided by Nick Fury, becoming members of Captain America&#x27;s Secret Avengers. Before storming the Negative Zone prison, Sue visits Namor to plead for assistance. He refuses and indicates she is still attracted to him, an accusation she does not deny.

During the final battle depicted in &quot;Civil War&quot; #7, as Susan is nearly shot by Taskmaster, but Reed Richards jumps in front of her and takes the brunt of the attack, sustaining a major injury. Outraged, Susan beats Taskmaster into the ground. Following the end of the war, Susan helps with the clean-up of New York City. She and the other Secret Avengers are granted amnesty, and she returns home to Reed. Seeking to repair the damage done to their marriage as a result of the war, Sue and Reed take time off from the Fantastic Four, but ask Storm and the Black Panther to take their places in the meantime.

===World War Hulk===
In the second issue of &quot;World War Hulk&quot;, the Fantastic Four confront the Hulk. Reed has designed a machine that recreates the Sentry&#x27;s aura. The Hulk, only momentarily calmed, discovers the ruse. Sue deploys her force fields to defend Reed against the Hulk, who shatters her protective fields with such force that she collapses, leaving Reed vulnerable. Reed suffers a vicious beating at the hands of the Hulk; Sue telephones the Sentry for help.

The Hulk transforms Madison Square Garden into a gladiatorial arena. Sue and the other defeated heroes are held captive in a lower level. The heroes are outfitted with the same obedience disks that were used to suppress the Hulk&#x27;s powers and force him to fight his companions on Sakaar.

===Death===
Some time after World War Hulk, but before Secret Invasion, the Richards family has hired a new nanny for their kids, Tabitha Deneuve. At the same time, a mysterious new group, calling themselves the New Defenders, commits robberies, and one of their members, Psionics, starts a relationship with Johnny. After a bad break-up, Johnny is kidnapped by the Defenders, along with Doctor Doom and Galactus, to power a massive machine that is designed to apparently save the people of the future 500 years from now, a plan orchestrated by Tabitha, who is revealed to be Susan Richards from 500 years in the future. Eventually, the present Fantastic Four are able to save both the present Earth and the future Earth by sending the future inhabitants to the Earth Trust&#x27;s private duplicate Nu-Earth, but after freeing Doctor Doom, the future Sue goes to apologize to him and is electrocuted by Doom.

===Secret Invasion: Fantastic Four===
While Susan is on a lecture tour in Vancouver, British Columbia, a Skrull posing as Mister Fantastic ambushes her, applying pressure to her skull with an invisible force field and knocking her unconscious. Then, a Skrull infiltrates the Baxter Building disguised as Susan and opens a portal into the Negative Zone, forcing the top three floors of the building into the Negative Zone, and in turn trapping herself, Johnny, Ben, and the two Richards children there. The Skrull impersonating her is later revealed to be Johnny&#x27;s ex-wife Lyja, who once infiltrated the Fantastic Four by impersonating Ben Grimm&#x27;s love interest Alicia Masters. The real Susan Richards is recovered alive from a downed Skrull ship after the final battle of the invasion.

===Future Foundation===
Reed started the Future Foundation for the benefit of the world and for science. When the Human Torch died, the Fantastic Four was dissolved and Sue&#x27;s heroic exploits were moved entirely under the banner of the Future Foundation. It is later revealed that Johnny was revived and is still alive.

===&quot;Secret Wars&quot;===
Sue and the rest of the Fantastic Four create a life raft that will save them from the coming death of the universe. However, right before the final incursion between their universe and the Ultimate Universe, Sue&#x27;s part of the ship becomes separated. Reed and Black Panther plan to get her ship back, with Sue holding her part together with her force field. However, the death of the universe proves too much, even for her, and she, Ben, and her children die at the hands of Oblivion, with Reed screaming in agony at the death of his wife and children. Captain Marvel tells him they need to go, and they leave Sue&#x27;s destroyed part of the ship behind.

When Molecule Man transfers his power to Reed, Reed used it to resurrect his family including Sue, and they began to rebuild the entire Multiverse.

Invisible Woman was later with Mister Fantastic and the Future Foundation when they were confronted by the Griever at the End of All Things.

==Powers and abilities==
The Invisible Woman received her powers after cosmic radiation had triggered mutagenic changes in her body. Originally only able to turn herself invisible, Sue later discovered she could render other things invisible as well and project an invisible force field. It has been said on numerous occasions, including by the Fantastic Four&#x27;s greatest opponent, Doctor Doom, that Susan Storm is the most powerful member of the quartet and one of the few beings able to rupture the shell of a Celestial.

===Invisibility===
As the Invisible Woman, Susan can render herself wholly or partially invisible at will by bending light around her. She can also render other people or objects fully or partially invisible too, affecting up to of volume. According to the &quot;Women of Marvel: Celebrating Seven Decades Handbook&quot;, Sue&#x27;s retinas don&#x27;t function conventionally and instead of just registering objects using reflected light, the retinas in Sue&#x27;s eyes also interpolate shapes based on reflected cosmic rays, which in the Marvel Universe are always present in the atmosphere, granted usually only in small concentrations. This anomaly apparently allows her to perceive invisible people and objects, though she does not see them in color since the cosmic-ray reflections bypass her eyes&#x27; rods and cones; her vision may also be monochromatic when she herself is invisible since her eyes do not reflect light in that state, though she otherwise seems to possess a full range of vision while she is invisible. She can also sense people or objects made invisible by scientific means, and can restore them to a visible state at will.

===Force-field projection===
Sue can also mentally generate a field of invisible psionic force (drawn from hyperspace), which she is able to manipulate for a variety of effects. For example, Sue can shape her fields into simple invisible constructs or generate a nearly indestructible invisible force field around herself or her target. She can vary the texture and tensile strength of her field to some extent, rendering it rigid as steel or as soft and yielding as foam rubber; softer variants on the field enable her to cushion impacts more gently, and are less likely to result in psionic backlash against Susan herself. She is also able to make her shields opaque or translucent like milk glass to effectively block variations of light such as laser-beams, or make them semipermeable to filter oxygen from water though the latter is mentally taxing. She can generate solid force constructs as small as a marble or as large as in diameter, and her hollow projections such as domes can extend up to several miles in area.

By generating additional force behind her psionic constructs, Sue can turn them into offensive weapons, ranging from massive invisible battering rams to small projectiles such as spheres and darts. By forming one of her force fields within an object and expanding the field, Sue can cause her target to explode. She can also travel atop her animated constructs, enabling her to simulate a limited approximation of levitation or flight. She can manipulate the energy of her force fields around other objects to simulate telekinetic abilities as well. She is capable of generating and manipulating multiple psionic force fields simultaneously. This power is only limited by her concentration; once she stops concentrating on a psionic force field, it simply ceases to exist.

Sue&#x27;s force fields can also counteract or interact with other forms of psychic energy. For instance, when battling against Psi-Lord, an adult version of her own son, her force fields shielded her mind from his telepathic abilities. Similarly, Jean Grey&#x27;s psychokinetic abilities could not pass through her shields.

===Miscellaneous abilities===
Susan is an excellent swimmer and capable unarmed combatant, having been trained in judo by Mister Fantastic and received additional coaching from Iron Fist, the Thing, and She-Hulk.

== Cultural impact and legacy ==
=== Critical reception ===
George Marston of &quot;Newsarama&quot; referred to the Invisible Woman as one of the &quot;best female superheroes of all time&quot;, writing, &quot;Marvel&#x27;s first superheroine (debuting 60 years ago this year in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #1 may not have the highest profile of the characters on this list, but Sue Storm set the pace for modern female heroes – and still occupies a fairly unique place in comic books. While it&#x27;s true that early stories didn&#x27;t exactly serve Sue particularly well, she developed into the heart and soul of the Fantastic Four, serving as Marvel&#x27;s first family&#x27;s de facto – and literal – mother. And that may be one of the most crucial aspects of her character. While Sue Storm is powerful in her own right – many writers have said she&#x27;s got the most raw power of anyone on the FF – she also represents an important aspect of womanhood that many female heroes have sacrificed or had used against them – motherhood. That Sue can serve as one of the most respected heroes in the Marvel Universe (and its first female hero) while simultaneously raising two children and shepherding the growth of many more through the Future Foundation can&#x27;t be understated. Plus, it takes a pretty amazing woman to stand up to a blowhard like Reed Richards.&quot; Garrett Martin of &quot;Paste&quot; called the Invisible Woman one of the characters who &quot;hold a special place within the Marvel Universe and the hearts of its fans,&quot; stating, &quot;Of the original team, Sue Storm has grown the most, by far, since &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #1. Not only was her official superhero name the Invisible Girl, even after getting married and having a child, but she was basically written like the typical early Marvel love interest, despite having powers. She was too demure, too squeamish and not always competent enough to feel like a true superhero. That&#x27;s changed so much that she&#x27;s basically the strongest member of the team today, emotionally, morally and in terms of her superpowers. That says a lot about how cultural perceptions of the role of women have shifted since 1961, and also about how Marvel, as a company, has never been afraid to reexamine its characters when the larger story demands it.&quot; Brett White of &quot;CBR.com&quot; described the Invisible Woman one of Marvel&#x27;s &quot;classic characters worthy of ongoing attention,&quot; saying, &quot;Since debuting in 1961, Sue Storm has played a pivotal role in the Marvel Universe without ever having even a single limited series to her name, unlike her brother the Human Torch or the Thing, as both have had a few series, ongoing and mini, between them. As both Marvel Comics&#x27; literal first lady and the Marvel Universe&#x27;s spiritual first lady, Sue Storm enjoys a level of prominence and importance that could prove to be fascinating material for a series. Turn Sue Storm into the Michelle Obama of the Marvel hero community. Make her inspiring and proactive; have her spearhead outreach opportunities to those in need, and have her go on diplomatic missions in hostile territories. Jonathan Hickman played with a lot of these ideas in his &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; run, and it&#x27;s time someone continued those stories.&quot; &quot;IGN&quot; named the Invisible Woman one of the &quot;greatest Avengers of all time&quot;, asserting, &quot;Invisible Woman is much more closely associated with the Fantastic Four than the Avengers, but that&#x27;s not to say she won&#x27;t answer the call alongside the rest of Earth&#x27;s Mightiest Heroes when necessary. Sue often tends to serve as the heart and soul of any team she serves on. Her power to manipulate invisible force fields arguably makes her the strongest of the FF. But despite that power she remains firmly grounded in the real world. She keeps her dysfunctional family in order, whether it&#x27;s dragging her husband and daughter out of the lab or making her hotshot brother act his age. Sue is a matriarch who isn&#x27;t at all afraid to kick some ass when the situation calls for it. And the Avengers&#x27; villains have come to realize that every bit as much as Doctor Doom or Galactus.&quot;

Gavia Baker-Whitelaw of &quot;The Daily Dot&quot; called the Invisible Woman one of the &quot;best female superheroes of all time&quot;, asserting, &quot;Sue Storm, aka the Invisible Woman, is an icon of the Marvel Universe. She rarely appears as a solo character. As a key member of the Fantastic Four, her superpowers include invisibility and the ability to create force fields. In some ways, her characterization plays into traditional gender roles. As Mr. Fantastic&#x27;s wife and Johnny Storm&#x27;s sister, she can be overshadowed by her male teammates. Her powers are often interpreted as passive because they&#x27;re more attuned to protection than aggressive combat. Several of her storylines involve unwanted romantic attention from characters like Dr. Doom. This all adds up to her being a rather divisive character. It would undoubtedly help if Marvel hired a female writer to explore her character for a new audience.&quot; Joshua Isaak of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; described the Invisible Woman as &quot;Marvel&#x27;s first major female superhero&quot;, stating, &quot;Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; is undoubtedly the series that defined the company - but unfortunately Stan Lee completely botched writing for Marvel&#x27;s first major female superhero, Susan Storm. Today, the character is famous for being a scientific genius, astronaut, and the strongest member of the team (with her ability to use her powerful invisible force fields in a variety of offensive and defensive ways). But for the first few years of the &quot;Fantastic Four,&quot; Sue was little more than a collection of 1960s stereotypes - the worst the decade had to offer. [...] Stan Lee found it necessary to constantly remind readers that Susan Storm was a woman (even though her superhero name remained Invisible &quot;Girl&quot; all the way until &quot;Fantastic Four #280&quot; in 1985!). Sue would create a version of her suit with a miniskirt, try on different looks in the mirror (&quot;A girl is a girl&quot; reads the caption above Sue trying on a black wig), and even decide to do housecleaning while the men lounged about after a battle. Thankfully, this wouldn&#x27;t last; Sue not only became a key player in superhero battles but would regularly call out Reed&#x27;s arrogance and superiority whenever he would insult her for being too &quot;emotional&quot; (which was distressingly often). In many ways, Sue was progressive for the time - many female characters in comics were relegated to love interests and rarely participated in battles at all. But as revolutionary as he was, Stan Lee couldn&#x27;t help but rely on outdated tropes while writing for Sue. Today, the Invisible Woman is a powerful and respected member of the Fantastic Four, and the early issues - however stereotypical - led to the Susan Storm known and loved by the Marvel faithful worldwide.&quot; Stephanie Williams of &quot;Syfy&quot; stated, &quot;The core four members of the Fantastic Four are a package deal. It&#x27;s challenging to think of one of them without the other. However, we&#x27;re going to do just that. Each member is unique in their own right, especially Sue Storm. She&#x27;s a character that has been around for almost 60 years, making her first leap onto the silver screen by way of Jessica Alba in the 2005 live-action &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;. This year marks the 15th anniversary of that early-aughts attempt at the iconic foursome. While it&#x27;s not a movie that&#x27;s high on many comic book movie lists, Jessica&#x27;s Sue does a reasonably strong job encapsulating a character with such a long history on the page, especially if you just ignore the dye job. Sue can be as hot-headed as her brother, if not more. She is always looking for smoke and absolutely deserves better than what Mr. Stretch can offer. The MCU provides a chance to introduce her in ways that highlight this amazing individual separate from her teammates in Fantastic Four.&quot; Laura Kelly of &quot;The Mary Sue&quot; wrote, &quot;None of the movies we&#x27;ve gotten could ever figure out what to do with Sue. Too many times, the focus would land on Reed Richards and his science experiments, or the comic relief of the Thing and the Human Torch. Sue was usually reduced to one character trait: girl. Admittedly, this was also a major problem in Sue Storm&#x27;s early comic book portrayal, and it was an uphill slog for her to get some real character development. And out of the four, Sue has ultimately gone through the most growth and has come out on the other side as probably the most powerful member of the team. [...] For an MCU remake, Sue Storm absolutely should be a scientist, but she needs to be a human being, too. First, Sue should not only be an active participant, but she should be Reed&#x27;s scientific equal. They should be working together on experiments and research and be actual contemporaries. In the comics, Sue is the glue that keeps the team together. Without her, the team would have fallen apart long ago. And that&#x27;s not an easy job. Sue has had to deal with Reed&#x27;s absent-mindedness (and dickishness), Johnny&#x27;s recklessness, and Ben&#x27;s temper, not to mention all the various infighting (physical and otherwise) that regularly breaks out. She&#x27;s had to be practical and grounded, but also sensitive and empathetic. That&#x27;s a lot of pressure on one person. Delving into that part of Sue&#x27;s psyche would make her a much more interesting, complex character.&quot;

== Literary reception ==
=== Volumes ===
==== &quot;Captain Universe&quot; / &quot;Invisible Woman&quot; - 2005 ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Captain Universe / Invisible Woman&quot; #1 was the 111th best selling comic book in November 2005.

==== &quot;Invisible Woman&quot; - 2020 ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, the &quot;Invisible Woman&quot; trade paperback was the 72nd best selling graphic novel in January 2020.

===== Issue 1 =====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Invisible Woman&quot; #1 was the 15th best selling comic book in July 2019.

Joe Grunenwald of &quot;ComicsBeat&quot; stated, &quot;The artwork from De Iulis throughout the issue was exceptional. His work first came to my attention on the digital &quot;Jessica Jones&quot; series, even if it was a little &#x27;house style-y&#x27; for me, so it&#x27;s nice to see him having evolved more or less past that into his own unique look with this series. I particularly appreciated the way his coloring represented Sue&#x27;s abilities. The opening sequence and the effect of the snow on a pair of invisible people was also something I&#x27;ve never seen done with Sue before from both a story and a visual standpoint. [...] I was enthusiastic about this book from the jump and it didn&#x27;t disappoint me. Sue Richards is such a rich character, and it&#x27;s great to see her have a chance to shine in the hands of a seasoned writer and an artist who&#x27;s really coming into his own. &quot;Invisible Woman&quot; #1 gets a BUY from me with no hesitation.&quot; Jesse Schedeen of &quot;IGN&quot; gave &quot;Invisible Woman&quot; #1 a grade of 6.5 out of 10, saying, &quot;De Iulis&#x27; art packs a unique punch, at least. De Iulis&#x27; lines are sleek and sharply rendered, with expressive facial work helping to heighten the emotion in any given scene. The vibrant colors are the book&#x27;s real standout element. Invisible Woman has a painterly aesthetic that makes it look unlike anything else Marvel is publishing. Whether this is truly the best look for an espionage-focused superhero comic is another question. As eye-catching as the art is, it also tends to be a little too clean and pretty to reflect the grungy surroundings in which Sue and friends are operating. &quot;Invisible Woman&quot; seems like an easy sell at first glance. It features the return of Mark Waid to a franchise he does better than almost anyone, along with a new take on an old heroine and a snazzy art style. Those element don&#x27;t coalesce into an effective whole in issue #1, however. The story lags once it shifts to the presents, and the art is perhaps too pretty for the subject matter.&quot;

===== Issue 2 =====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Invisible Woman&quot; #2 was the 81st best selling comic book in August 2019.

Jamie Lovett of &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; gave &quot;Invisible Woman&quot; #2 a grade of 4 out of 5, stating, &quot;The second issue of Invisible Woman does a better job of making a case for its own existence than the first. The themes are clearer, as Mark Waid shows the assumptions made about Invisible Woman as a wife and mother being incapable of carrying her weight in the field. Waid also does a great job of coming up with scenarios for Sue to use her powers in unconventional ways, and Mattia de Iulis draws it all with a soft line that fits the stories tone and pace without skimping on some great big action moments. A marked improvement over the debut issue.&quot;

==Other versions==
A number of alternate universes and alternate timelines in Marvel Comics publications allow writers to introduce variations of the Invisible Woman, in which the character&#x27;s origins, behavior, and morality differ from the mainstream setting. In some stories, someone other than Susan Storm is the Invisible Woman, and in others, Susan Storm is someone other than the Invisible Woman.

===Age of Apocalypse===
In the alternative reality known as the Age of Apocalypse, Susan never became the Invisible Woman, but instead helped her boyfriend Reed Richards in his attempt to evacuate a large group of humans from Manhattan when Apocalypse came into power. Along with Ben Grimm as the pilot and her brother Johnny as crew, they used one of Reed&#x27;s prototype rockets to fly off the island. However, a mutant sabotaged the launch and both Reed and Johnny sacrificed themselves to let the others blast off safely.

Susie and Ben join the Human High Council as hired muscle. They are sent to the Eurasian Security Field Command Center to retrieve Bruce Banner, the scientist who worked on the nuclear warhead project that made the Council&#x27;s pre-emptive nuclear strike possible. They found the facilities barraged by a Thing. The two are able to defeat the monster and retrieve Banner so they can board Mikhail Rasputin&#x27;s mothership as one of a few select representatives allowed to board the Horseman&#x27;s vessel as part of a false peace convoy. The humans are hoodwinked and held captive on the ship until Tony Stark, another captive on Mikhail&#x27;s vessel, short circuits the craft with his mechanized heart. After they are freed, Ben and Susan help with the evacuation of the humans, piloting the ships after Banner to unify all the transfer arks into a single fleet used to flee from Earth.

===&quot;Age of Ultron&quot;===
In the &quot;Age of Ultron&quot; storyline, Invisible Woman is the only surviving member of the Fantastic Four, and joins a group of surviving heroes. The group goes to the Savage Land to find Nick Fury, with a plan of going forward in time to destroy Ultron in the future, where he is coordinating his attack. Wolverine, however, believes they should go back in time and kill Hank Pym before he creates Ultron, arguing Pym would see a warning not to create the robot as a challenge, and create Ultron regardless.

The group decides against this, and several members go to the future. Wolverine then goes to the past, with the intent of assassinating Pym. Invisible Woman stows away with him in hopes of convincing him otherwise. When Wolverine attacks Pym, Invisible Woman creates a force field to stop the killing blow. Torn between Hank&#x27;s pleas for help, and Wolverine&#x27;s reminders of what will happen if he lives, Sue allows Wolverine to kill Pym. After the consequences of this decision were realized, Wolverine went back to this point again and convinced his past self to stand down. The Wolverines and Sue manage to help Pym create a backdoor in Ultron&#x27;s programming that will stop him before he can launch his attack in the first place.

===&quot;Age of X&quot;===
In the &quot;Age of X&quot; reality where mutants are hunted, Sue is the only free member of the Fantastic Four left after she betrayed the other three to the government for harboring a mutant after the mutant attacked Franklin. Unlike some of her colleagues in the mutant-hunting Avengers, Sue merely wishes to contain mutants rather than kill them, and eventually sacrifices herself to save the mutant retreat from a suicide bombing by her former teammate, the Hulk.

===Counter-Earth===
On Counter Earth, counterparts of the Fantastic Four hijack an experimental spaceship in order to be the first humans in space. Man-Beast negates the effects of the cosmic radiation for all of them except Reed Richards who succumbs to the effects a decade later. When their craft crashes, Sue Storm falls into a coma from which she does not awake.

===&quot;Exiles&quot;===
Various versions of Sue have appeared many times in the pages of &quot;Exiles&quot;:
* Queen Susan Boltagon, who was married to Black Bolt and helped him defeat that reality&#x27;s tyrannical dictator Iron Man.
* Empress Hydra, controller of Captain America, Slaymaster, and Wolverine, the latter of whom she has romantic feelings for, this version of Sue has killed billions and plans to move onto other Earths. Along with the Exiles, she is opposed by that reality&#x27;s Reed Richards and Elektra. After the Exiles defeated her, she escaped into another dimension and began recruiting villains defeated by the Exiles across various dimensions to form a team to defeat them.
* Queen Susan McKenzie, who was married to Namor, bearing him two children, named Gambit and Valeria Fen, having been the only survivor of the test flight that endowed her with her powers.

===&quot;Marvel 1602&quot;===
In the miniseries &quot;Marvel 1602&quot;, Susan Storm is a member of the Four from the Fantastick, in reference to the ship upon which she and three others gained their powers in the Sargasso Sea. Unlike in the Marvel Universe, she is weightless and cannot become visible. She is related to the alchemical element of air as stated by Neil Gaiman.

At the start of &quot;Marvel 1602: Fantastick Four&quot;, Susan is visibly pregnant with Sir Richard Reed&#x27;s child. He forbids her to join him in his pursuit of Otto von Doom while in this condition, but she goes anyway. Much to Miss Doris Evans&#x27; shock, Sir Richard and Susan are not married. She displays the ability to create force fields but becomes visible when doing so.

===Marvel 2099===
On the Marvel 2099 reality of Earth-96943, the Invisible Woman of 2099 is a clone of Susan Storm. She and her fellow Fantastic Four clones were created by the 2099 version of Uatu the Watcher.

===&quot;Marvel Apes&quot;===
In the alternative universe of &quot;Marvel Apes&quot;, the Invisible Girl is an ape who unwillingly turns human after gaining her powers. This causes her great distress. She reaches out in friendship to another human named Charles Darwin who was also stranded in the ape-verse. Later, she assists in the defense of her universe against zombie invaders. She is flash-fried and consumed by her zombie &#x27;brother&#x27;.

===Marvel Mangaverse===
In the alternative universe of the Marvel Mangaverse, the Invisible Girl is Sioux Storm. Her half-sister is Jonatha Storm. Sioux has near psychosis-level emotional detachment and may suffer from Borderline personality disorder. In order to get her to fight or show any interest, Reed has programmed her battle suit to inject near-overdoses of battle stimulants and aggressor hormones into her bloodstream. She is a member of the Megascale Metatalent Response Team Fantastic Four. The team uses power packs that allow them to manifest at mecha-sized levels. Sioux projects a tall &quot;invisible friend&quot; constructed from her invisible force fields. The team fights Godzilla-sized monsters from various alien xenocultures that attack Earth in order to put an end to experiments that endanger all of reality. In &quot;Mangaverse&quot; volume 1 the team destroys a mecha-like Annihilus.

In &quot;New Mangaverse&quot; Sioux is murdered by ninja assassins dispatched by the Hand.

===&quot;Marvel Zombies&quot;===
The &quot;Marvel Zombies&quot; universe&#x27;s version of Reed Richards deliberately infected his team, including Sue, with the zombie virus, following madness from the murder of their children at the hands of a zombified She-Hulk. The Zombie Fantastic Four subsequently make contact with their Ultimate counterparts, attempting to escape into the Ultimate Marvel universe. Zombie Reed is neutralized when the Ultimate Invisible Girl destroys a chunk of his brain. After a brief period of imprisonment, Sue and the zombie Fantastic Four are killed by Ultimate Doctor Doom and returned to their universe.

===MC2===
In the MC2 universe, Sue and Reed recently returned from space, where Sue had been holding back a rift in reality with her force powers. Sue is instrumental in battling Galactus during the &quot;Last Planet Standing&quot; miniseries in which she deployed psionic force fields to prevent a tsunami from leveling New York.

===&quot;Mutant X&quot;===
In the darker reality of Mutant X, Sue does not have superpowers, but wears a high tech &quot;stealth&quot; suit. She is shown dead along with several other super heroes who attempted to stop the Beyonder.

===&quot;Spider-Gwen&quot;===
On Earth-65 in &quot;Spider-Gwen&quot;, the Storm Twins (modelled after Cersei and Jaime Lannister as respectively portrayed by Lena Headey and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau in &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;) are former child stars-turned-influencer sitcom leads of the popular television series &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot;. Secretly sharing an incestuous and manipulative relationship, both siblings publicly go missing on a trip to Latveria while in-fact seducing and manipulating the benevolent Latverian ruler Victor Von Doom over the course of five years into granting them superpowers, before Susan murders him and takes his place as Doctor Doom, converting Latveria to a dictatorship under her command. When the siblings return to New York, they murder their own mother, before blackmailing Gwen Stacy into leaving her home reality, taking control over the criminal underworld while posing as vigilantes to &quot;stop&quot; crimes they themselves instigated. As of 2023, they are still in control of the criminal underworld, with Gwen only occasionally allowed to return to her Earth.

===Ultimate Marvel===
The &quot;Ultimate Marvel&quot; version of Susan Storm is an eighteen-year-old biochemistry prodigy who grew up in the Baxter Building in the gifted and talented program supervised by her father. Though her newfound fame and beauty has brought her unsought attention from the likes of billionaire playboy Tony Stark, the former Baxter Building scientist turned villain, Mole Man, the Atlantean criminal Namor, and even her own friend and teammate, Ben Grimm, she remains romantically attached to Reed Richards despite her concerns about his over devotion to science. Throughout the series, Sue has been a major player in events such as &quot;Ultimate Secret&quot; and &quot;Ultimate Power&quot;. In &quot;Ultimate Salem&#x27;s Seven&quot;, Sue Storm leaves Reed Richards and moves to Oregon to study a bizarre sentient organism. It has been shown that this organism is responsible for creating the Salem&#x27;s Seven. She returns to Oregon to destroy the creature with Namor and the rest of her team. In the ensuing explosion Reed is trapped by molten lava. When Sue saves him with her invisible force field, they reconcile. She would later play a part in the Ultimatum event where she pushes back a tidal wave that floods New York with a colossal psionic field. She saves the city, but the mental strain puts her into a deep coma. She would later be awoken from her coma through the combined efforts of Mole Man and the Thing, during the course of which it is revealed that Ben harbors romantic feelings towards Susan. After the Ultimatum Sue breaks up with Reed and follows in her mother&#x27;s footsteps after proposing to Ben. She is later assaulted, along with other heroes, by Reed, who had turned to villainy.

This version of Sue Storm is an accomplished scientist in her own right. Reed even describes her as &quot;just a teeny bit smarter than him&quot;, but when Reed once mentioned this to Ben, Susan responded with &quot;Reed is an idiot,&quot; as she always envies Reed&#x27;s abilities and considers him the &quot;king of physics&quot;. (See ) It is Sue who does research into the biomolecular basis of the Fantastic Four&#x27;s powers and she manages to understand how Reed&#x27;s and her brother Johnny&#x27;s powers as Mister Fantastic and the Human Torch work.

====Kang the Conqueror====
A future version of the Ultimate Marvel Sue appears as Kang the Conqueror guiding Reed as The Maker to prevent destruction of their planet by Galactus while forming a &quot;Dark Ultimates&quot; to combat the Ultimates.

===Ultimate Universe===
During the &quot;Ultimate Invasion&quot; storyline, Maker traveled to Earth-6160 and remade it into his own image. One of the things he did was make sure that those who would&#x27;ve became the Fantastic Four didn&#x27;t fly into the cosmic storm. Maker&#x27;s memory log lists Susan Storm as &quot;deceased&quot;. This was further elaborated in Doom&#x27;s flashback where they took the shuttle into outer space against Franklin Storm&#x27;s orders. Because of Maker&#x27;s sabotage, Susan Storm was dying from the radiation while her brother Johnny burned to death. Franklin Storm used his connections to allow an incarcerated Reed Richards to see Susan Storm one last time before she died of the radiation as he also blamed Reed for killing his children.

===&quot;What If?&quot;===
Marvel&#x27;s &quot;What If?&quot; comic book series featured several alternative versions of Sue Storm and the Fantastic Four.

====Fantastic Five====
On the world designated Earth-772, in &quot;What If?&quot;, Spider-Man joined the Fantastic Four, but his presence resulted in Sue feeling increasingly sidelined in favour of the four male members of the team, resulting in her leaving the team to marry the Sub-Mariner. Although Reed was briefly driven insane and declared war on Atlantis, he eventually recovered and the two apparently reconciled, resulting in the &#x27;Fantastic Five&#x27; reforming once again in time to confront Annihilus in the Negative Zone to help Susan give birth.

====Ultra Woman====
In &quot;What If?&quot; #6 (Dec 1977), after the team are exposed to cosmic rays, they develop powers based on their personalities. Sue Storm gains the ability to stretch and reshape her body, because her personality caused her to try to fit in with the more dominating friends, while Reed Richards vast intellect causes him to become a giant floating brain. Sue takes the name Ultra Woman in this reality.

This version of the Fantastic Four reappeared in the Volume II story arc &#x27;Timestorm&#x27;, summoned by the Watcher to persuade the man who would become Kang/Immortus not to become a threat. Sue, along with the other members of this alternative Fantastic Four, are killed by Immortus.

====Flo Steinberg====
In &quot;What If?&quot; Volume 1, #11 (May 1978), an alternative universe is shown wherein the original 1960&#x27;s staff of Marvel Comics are exposed to cosmic rays by Skrulls. Marvel Comics secretary Flo Steinberg gains the powers of the Invisible Girl, and together with Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, and Sol Brodsky, she continues to work by day at Marvel Comics, while operating in secret as a member of the Fantastic Four.

====Vol. II #11====
In &quot;What If?&quot; vol. 2 #11 (March 1990), the origins of the Fantastic Four are retold, showing how the heroes lives would have changed if all four had gained the same powers as the individual members of the original Fantastic Four.

* Fire Powers: In this alternative history the cosmic rays give the four the powers of the Human Torch. They decide to use their powers for good, and become the Fantastic Four. They battle such menaces as the Mole Man and the alien race Skrulls. During a battle with the mystic Miracle Man, the villain brings to life a statue advertising a monster movie called &quot;The Monster from Mars.&quot; When the heroes set fire to the statue, the fire spreads to a local apartment building, killing young Angelica Parsons. Feeling responsible for Parsons&#x27;s death, the team disbands. Sue, troubled by Angelica&#x27;s death, becomes a nun.
* Elastic powers: In this alternative history, Reed, Sue, Johnny, and Ben develop the ability to stretch. Deciding not to become superheroes, Ben and Sue discover their love for one another and settle down to raise a family, never using their stretching powers again. 
* Monstrous forms: The cosmic rays in this alternative history transform the four into monstrous creatures, with Sue taking on a mindless form similar to Man-Thing. When the public reacts with fright at their appearances, they choose to leave civilization and live on Monster Isle.
* Invisibility powers: In the final &quot;What If?&quot; story, Ben Grimm, Reed Richards, Johnny Storm, and Sue Storm gain different aspects of the mainstream Sue Storm&#x27;s power. Sue can turn invisible, Reed can project invisibility, Ben projects invisible force-fields, and Johnny can become intangible. They join Colonel Nick Fury&#x27;s new C.I.A. unit, codenamed S.H.I.E.L.D. The story retells their initial encounter with Doctor Doom under these circumstances.

<text>Mamie Smith ( Robinson; May 26, 1891 – August or September 16, 1946) was an American singer. As a vaudeville singer, she performed in multiple styles, including jazz and blues. In 1920, she entered blues history as the first African-American artist to make vocal blues recordings. Willie &quot;The Lion&quot; Smith (no relation) described the background of these recordings in his autobiography &quot;Music on My Mind&quot; (1964).

== Early life ==
Robinson was born in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1891. The year of her birth has been given as 1883, but in 2018, researcher John Jeremiah Sullivan discovered her birth certificate stating she was born in Cincinnati in 1891.

When she was around age 10, she found work touring with the Four Dancing Mitchells, a white act. As a teenager, she danced in Salem Tutt Whitney&#x27;s &quot;Smart Set&quot;. In 1913, she left the Tutt Brothers to sing in clubs in Harlem and married William &quot;Smitty&quot; Smith, a singer.

== Musical career ==
On February 14, 1920, Smith recorded &quot;That Thing Called Love&quot; and &quot;You Can&#x27;t Keep a Good Man Down&quot; for the Okeh label in New York City, after African-American songwriter and bandleader Perry Bradford persuaded Fred Hager to break the color barrier in black music recording. Okeh Records recorded many iconic songs by black musicians. Although this was the first recording by a black blues singer, the backing musicians were all white. Hager had received threats from Northern and Southern pressure groups saying they would boycott the company if he recorded a black singer. Despite these threats, the record was a commercial success and opened the door for more black musicians to record.

Smith&#x27;s biggest hits were the August 10, 1920 recordings of a set of songs written by Perry Bradford, including &quot;Crazy Blues&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Right Here for You (If You Don&#x27;t Get It, &#x27;Tain&#x27;t No Fault of Mine)&quot;, again for Okeh Records, A million copies were sold in less than a year. Many were bought by African Americans, and there was a sharp rise in sales of &quot;race records&quot;. Because of its historical significance, &quot;Crazy Blues&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1994 and was selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress in 2005.

Although other African Americans had been recorded earlier, such as George W. Johnson in the 1890s, they were performing music that had a substantial following among European-American audiences. The success of Smith&#x27;s record prompted record companies to seek to record other female blues singers and began the era of what is now known as classic female blues.

Smith continued to make popular recordings for Okeh throughout the 1920s. In 1924, she made three releases for Ajax Records, which, while heavily promoted, did not sell well. She made some records for Victor. She toured the United States and Europe with the band Mamie Smith &amp; Her Jazz Hounds as part of &quot;Mamie Smith&#x27;s Struttin&#x27; Along Review&quot;.

She was billed as &quot;The Queen of the Blues&quot;, a billing soon one-upped by Bessie Smith, who was called &quot;The Empress of the Blues&quot;. Mamie found that the mass medium of radio provided a means of gaining additional fans, especially in cities with predominantly white audiences. For example, she and several members of her band performed on KGW in Portland, Oregon in early May 1923 and received positive reviews.

Recording lineups of the Jazz Hounds included (from August 1920 to October 1921) Jake Green, Curtis Moseley, Garvin Bushell, Johnny Dunn, Dope Andrews, Ernest Elliot, Porter Grainger, Leroy Parker and Bob Fuller, and (from June 1922 to January 1923) Coleman Hawkins, Everett Robbins, Johnny Dunn, Herschel Brassfield, Herb Flemming, Buster Bailey Cutie Perkins, Joe Smith, Bubber Miley, and Cecil Carpenter.

While recording with the Jazz Hounds, she recorded as Mamie Smith and Her Jazz Band, comprising George Bell, Charles Matson, Nathan Glantz, Larry Briers, Jules Levy, Jr., Joe Samuels, together with musicians from the Jazz Hounds, including Hawkins, Fuller and Carpenter.

== Film career and later years ==
Smith appeared in the early sound film &quot;Jailhouse Blues&quot; in 1929. She retired from recording and performing in 1931. She returned to performing in 1939 to appear in the movie &quot;Paradise in Harlem&quot;, produced by her husband, Jack Goldberg.

She also appeared in other films, including &quot;Mystery in Swing&quot; (1940), &quot;Sunday Sinners&quot; (1940), &quot;Stolen Paradise&quot; (1941), &quot;Murder on Lenox Avenue&quot; (1941), and &quot;Because I Love You&quot; (1943).

== Death and memorial ==
Smith died in 1946 in New York City, reportedly penniless. She was interred at Frederick Douglass Memorial Park on Staten Island, on ground which remained unmarked until 2013 when a monument was finally erected.

Initially, according to the Jas Obrecht Music Archive website, Smith was buried in an unmarked grave until 1963 when musicians from Iserlohn, West Germany used the money from a Hot Jazz benefit to buy a headstone that read &quot;Mamie Smith (1883–1946): First Lady of the Blues&quot;. With the help of fellow blues singer Victoria Spivey and &quot;Record Research Magazine&quot; publisher Len Kunstadt, Smith was re-interred at Frederick Douglass Memorial Park in Richmond, New York. Smith&#x27;s re-interment was celebrated with a gala honoring the late singer on January 27, 1964. However, according to the 2012 campaign website, Mamie Smith still was buried without a headstone 67 years after her death in 1946.

A successful campaign to finally acquire and erect a headstone for Smith was begun in 2012 by Michael and Anne Fanciullo Cala. The couple, respectively a blues journalist and editor, developed a months-long crowdfunding campaign on the Indiegogo website to purchase a headstone for Smith. The philanthropy Music Cares also supported the effort. The campaign raised over $8,000 that funded the creation of a four-foot-high etched granite headstone featuring an image of the late blues singer.

The monument was erected with great fanfare at Frederick Douglass Cemetery in Staten Island, New York on September 20, 2013. Excess funds from the campaign were donated to the cemetery for grounds care.

<text>The Mysterons are a fictional race of extraterrestrials and the antagonists in the 1960s British Supermarionation television series &quot;Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons&quot; (1967–68) and its 2005 animated remake, &quot;New Captain Scarlet&quot;.

The Mysterons in the series are the remnants of the original Mysteron race: alien beings that originated in a galaxy other than the Milky Way and maintained a colony on Mars. They are symbolised by ubiquitous, projected green rings of light and the deep bass voice of their first human convert, Captain Black.

They were voiced by Donald Gray in the original series and Mike Hayley in the remake. In the 2000 animated test film &quot;Captain Scarlet and the Return of the Mysterons&quot;, they were voiced by Gary Martin.

==Depiction==
===&quot;Captain Scarlet&quot;===
As shown in the first episode, hostilities between Earth and the Mysterons commence following a &quot;Zero-X&quot; expedition to Mars, led by Captain Black of the Earth security organisation Spectrum. The purpose of the mission had been to locate the source of radio signals that Spectrum had detected emanating from the planet. The &quot;Zero-X&quot; astronauts discover an alien city on the Martian surface. After mistaking a deployed surveillance device for a weapon, Black fears an attack and orders a missile attack on the complex, destroying it. However, the city is almost immediately rebuilt before their eyes as a blue beam of light passes over its ruins.

Speaking in a deep, echoing voice, the aliens identify themselves as the Mysterons and state that they have discovered &quot;the secret of reversing matter&quot; (a power later referred to as &quot;retrometabolism&quot;). They have the ability to heal any physical injury and re-create the exact likeness of any object or person – a power they can exercise only after the original person or object has been destroyed. Dedicating themselves to a &quot;slow but nonetheless effective&quot; retaliation for the unprovoked attack on their complex, the Mysterons take control of Black&#x27;s mind and return him to Earth to act as their primary agent, destroying people and objects so that they may be re-created under Mysteron control.

Attempting to assassinate the World President, the Mysterons kill and re-create Spectrum&#x27;s foremost agent, Captain Scarlet, as an indestructible doppelganger. The plot fails, however, when Scarlet&#x27;s reconstruction falls to its apparent death from the top of a tower, later returning to life with his indestructible qualities intact but his original human consciousness restored.

The Mysterons broadcast their threats by radio, often disguising their intentions using word play – such as stating that they will &quot;kill time&quot; when they intend to kill a Spanish official whose surname is Tiempo in the episode &quot;Operation Time&quot;. The original script for the first episode described the voice of the Mysterons as &quot;commanding&quot; and &quot;hypnotic&quot;, also specifying that it would be created &quot;by the [voice] artist inhaling helium and the subsequent recording being played back at a lower speed, together with a repetitive echo treatment&quot;.

The Mysterons are represented by twin rings of green light that they cast onto scenes of death and destruction from which their facsimiles emerge. The pilot script described these rings as &quot;two fiery green circles&quot; suggestive of eyes. Gerry Anderson said that he came up with this device after seeing a TV advertisement for wool that featured the Woolmark logo being projected over the body of a woman. During filming, the ring effect was produced by panning a transparency across the set using a slide projector.

Mysteron reconstructions of humans are impenetrable to X-rays, making radiographs of their forms indistinguishable from photographs. This enables Spectrum to develop a device (the &quot;Mysteron Detector&quot;) capable of identifying them. Additionally, reconstructions are particularly vulnerable to electrical current.

The re-creation process requires the subject to be clinically dead before the copy is created. In &quot;Treble Cross&quot;, air force pilot Major Gravener is killed and duplicated but later resuscitated in hospital, allowing Spectrum to set a trap for the Mysterons by sending out the original Gravener in place of his double.

Despite their general ruthlessness, some episodes show that the Mysterons are unwilling to cause suffering. In &quot;Manhunt&quot;, Captain Black releases one of the Spectrum Angels from a radioactive booth before she suffers fatal injury – albeit after trapping her there, and then only as a ruse to evade Spectrum.

===Comic strips===

The Captain Scarlet comic strip in &quot;TV Century 21&quot; depicted the Mysterons as both energy beings and a computer collective.

On 16 September 1967, a new comic strip called &quot;The Mysterons&quot; appeared simultaneously in the comic books &quot;Solo&quot; and its sister publication &quot;TV Tornado&quot;. The initial story provides an adaptation of the destruction of the Mysteron city on Mars by Captain Black, as shown in the first episode of &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot;. Following the re-creation of the city, the strip shows the previously peaceful Mysterons deciding that they must protect themselves from further aggression by conquering the universe. To that end, some of the Mysterons depart in a flying saucer, headed for the Andromeda Galaxy.

&quot;Solo&quot; merged with the &quot;TV Tornado&quot; comic the following week, with the Mysteron strip running in the latter publication from issues 36 to 58. In the second instalment, when a Mysteron party lands on the planet Andorme, the atmosphere restores the hitherto disembodied creatures to visibility in the &quot;ancient Mysteron shape&quot;. In this form they are depicted as spherical, polyhedral beings, with three of the faces having &quot;eye slits&quot;, one of which can emit a destructive energy beam.

===&quot;New Captain Scarlet&quot;===
In the remake, &quot;New Captain Scarlet&quot;, the Mysterons live in a city on Mars that is normally hidden from view. The city appears on the surface of Mars for the first time in 2068, during an ill-fated landing by Captains Scarlet and Black (&quot;Instrument of Destruction, Part 1&quot;). They are categorically stated to be energy beings, with one shown to be capable of transforming into the &quot;green rings&quot;, and are to some extent individualised – there is a dissenting faction in the &quot;Mysteron consciousness&quot; (as a member of the faction puts it) that believes that, given time, humans will outgrow their destructive impulses and become more like the Mysterons. Unfortunately for the series&#x27; protagonists, this group has virtually no influence, and their only agent dispatched to Earth is quickly apprehended by Black.

The Mysterons appear as a pair of green rings; however, it is not known whether this is the result of technology. They claim to be peaceful beings, but wage a &quot;war of nerves&quot; against the people of Earth following Black&#x27;s devastating assault on the Mysteron city.

The Mysterons possess the ability to reconstruct exact replicas of objects or persons. It is due to this remarkable ability that they are able to re-create their city following Black&#x27;s attack. They also employ this power from time to time during the &quot;Mysteronisation&quot; process, which imbues their reconstructions (dubbed &quot;replicants&quot; by Spectrum) with the power of &quot;retrometabolisation&quot; – the replicant is able to heal completely from almost any injury, including fatal ones. Replicants may occasionally break from Mysteron control when confronted by human loved ones or are reminded of their past. Often this is only temporary, and the Mysterons forcibly and painfully reassert control over the replicant. The only known survivor of the process is Scarlet, who retains his retrometabolism and remains virtually indestructible, an ability which is a great asset in his work.

Mysterons are also able to control the minds of their human victims, whether the subject has been replicated or not. Mysterons make use of hypnosis for short-term control, as demonstrated by the replicant of Commander Lewis on Doctor Gold (&quot;The Homecoming&quot;). To create a full agent, they use the reconstruction process which leaves them in total control of the victim&#x27;s body.

The Mysteronisation process alters human biology at the subatomic level, changing its DNA. This genetic alteration makes replicants vulnerable to detection, and as such all Spectrum personnel are subject to regular DNA checks.

==Critical response==
Commentators have offered a range of explanations as to the exact nature of the Mysterons. According to Nicholas J. Cull, they are a species of &quot;invisible&quot; alien, while Alasdair Wilkins and Sophie Bushwick of the website io9 describe them as &quot;an unfathomable race of probably non-corporeal entities&quot;. The tie-in publication &quot;The Complete Book of Captain Scarlet&quot; by Chris Bentley refutes the notion that the Mysterons of the original series are a type of energy being, instead referring to them as &quot;sentient computers&quot; forming a group mind. The computer complex on Mars is the legacy of the original, corporeal Mysteron race – described as being of extragalactic origin and &quot;masters in the art of computer technology&quot; – who colonised the planet in the 2nd millennium BC and abandoned it at the start of the 20th century AD.

Eamonn McCusker of The Digital Fix describes the Mysterons – along with their primary agent, Captain Black – as &quot;the perfect villains&quot;, arguing that their menacing voices and green &quot;eyes&quot; helped to make &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; &quot;more memorable than any of Anderson&#x27;s other shows&quot;. Sarah Kurchak of The A.V. Club believes that the Mysterons marked a departure from the villains of earlier Anderson productions due to their apparent omnipresence and omnipotence. She describes them as &quot;truly, realistically terrifying [...] an unknowable foreign entity capable of the deepest undercover work that could strike at any time,&quot; adding that Spectrum&#x27;s occasional defeats at their hands made them &quot;all the more alarming&quot;. Wilkins and Bushwick categorise the Mysterons as an example of the &quot;monstrous and evil&quot; type of Martian commonly seen in film, TV and literature, and rank them second only to the invaders of the H. G. Wells novel &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; (1897) for malevolence.

Simon J. Gerard of &quot;Starburst&quot; magazine regards the secondary title sequence – in which the Mysterons, represented only by their &quot;strange green light beams&quot;, announce their latest threat to Spectrum – as the &quot;defining moment&quot; of the original &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot;. The authors of &quot;The Rough Guide to Cult TV&quot; argue that for younger children, the aliens&#x27; slow, deep voice &quot;seemed to embody evil.&quot; Several commentators argue that the fact that the Mysterons remain unseen, preferring instead to operate through their replicated intermediaries, makes them all the more frightening. Digital Spy&#x27;s Morgan Jeffery calls the Mysterons&#x27; invisibility &quot;a masterstroke, and another reason why &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; holds up well to the scrutiny of an adult eye. The Hood from &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;, &quot;Stingray&quot;″s Aquaphibians - these are characters unlikely to disturb the dreams of any but the very young. The Mysterons, though? The images conjured up in the minds of older children with over-active imaginations would have been far more terrifying than anything Anderson and his team could have hoped to construct.&quot;

Kyle Anderson of Nerdist.com considers the Mysterons&#x27; schemes &quot;pretty ingenious&quot;. Other commentators have criticised their methods. Tom Spilsbury questions the wisdom of making the duplicate of Captain Scarlet indestructible given that his death and resurrection in the first episode cause him to break free of Mysteron control. Jeffery queries why the aliens need to create duplicates at all, given that they are apparently able to manipulate Black through mind control. In addition, both Spilsbury and others consider it tactically unsound for the Mysterons, when broadcasting threats to Earth, to inform Spectrum of their exact targets. Writing for &quot;Starburst&quot;, Andrew Pixley and Julie Rogers suggest that the aliens&#x27; transmitted threats make them sound &quot;like some evil alien Ted Rogers&quot;. Andrew Blair of Den of Geek writes that &quot;there&#x27;s something both rubbish and endearing about the Mysterons&#x27; attempts to harass humanity into submission with their decidedly piecemeal approach.&quot;

===Symbolism===
Actor Cy Grant, who voiced the original Lieutenant Green and praised &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; for its positive multiculturalism, believed that the series employed a form of black-and-white dualism of which the Mysterons were an aspect: &quot;The &#x27;darkness&#x27; of the Mysterons is most easily seen as the psychological rift — the struggle of &#x27;good&#x27; and &#x27;evil&#x27; — of the Western world as personified by Colonel White and his team. Dark and light are but aspects of each other. Incidentally, green is the colour of nature that can heal that rift.&quot;

The Mysterons have also been interpreted as part of a supposed religious allegory in the series. Grant and other commentators have compared Cloudbase (Spectrum&#x27;s airborne headquarters) to Heaven, Colonel White (the head of Spectrum) to God, and the resurrected Captain Scarlet (White&#x27;s top agent) to the Son of God; Captain Black, a Spectrum officer-turned-Mysteron agent, is viewed as either an analogue of the Devil or a Judas figure in league with the &quot;satanic&quot; Mysterons of the planet Mars (which Grant likened to Hades). Anderson denied that any of this symbolism was intentional.

===Cold War analysis===
Bill Osgerby argues that the Mysterons&#x27; tactic of replacing humans with alien doppelgangers promotes &quot;themes of anxiety and mistrust&quot; and an &quot;atmosphere of unease and ambiguity&quot;, which he believes reflect the &quot;crisis and collapse of social and political certainties&quot; during the 1960s. Cull, who interprets the original &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; as a media product of the Cold War, regards the Mysterons&#x27; campaign against Earth as a kind of &quot;Cold War scenario&quot;. In an allusion to other science fiction of the time, he states that the Mysterons&#x27; reconstructive ability &quot;creates an ever-present danger of an enemy within, which is the stuff of archetypal Cold War paranoia narratives on the model of &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot; (1956).&quot; He adds that &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; reflects progressive attitudes to real-world events in that it is humans who start the conflict by attacking the Mysteron city; this &quot;opens the issue of blame and invites reflection on the guilt of one&#x27;s own side.&quot; Discussing humanity&#x27;s first contact with the Mysterons in the original series&#x27; first episode, Geoff Willmetts of Sfcrowsnest notes the Mysterons&#x27; technological advantages and humanity&#x27;s status as a relatively &quot;immature sentient species&quot;, stating that this leads to a lack of trust that provokes conflict. He comments: &quot;This is a dilemma of any first contact scenario. One side is always likely to be superior to the other and that will always build some elements of mistrust as to what motivates them and their actions.&quot; For Jeffery, that the Mysterons are not &quot;out-and-out villains&quot; is one of the elements that makes &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; more &quot;mature&quot; than &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;.

===Comparison to terrorism===
The Mysterons&#x27; tactics have been characterised as a form of terrorism by Gerry Anderson and others, including commentator Andrew Billen. Jim Sangster and Paul Condon consider it &quot;oddly prophetic&quot; that &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot;″s original UK run ended not long before the hi-jacking of El Al Flight 426, an event that &quot;made political terrorism big news.&quot; They regard the series&#x27; theme of terrorism as &quot;incredibly perceptive&quot; on Anderson&#x27;s part, calling it &quot;staggering ... that at the same time as airplane hi-jacks became a distressingly regular occurrence in the Middle East, and IRA bombings in London, Gerry Anderson was explaining the effects of terrorism to kids, even down to having an aggressor who, it could be argued, has a genuine cause for complaint.&quot;

The aftermath of the September 11 attacks and subsequent War on Terror have also prompted comparisons. In 2003, Tom Weaver of &quot;Starlog&quot; magazine noted that the Mysterons employ &quot;what in these troubled times would be called sleeper agents and homicide bombers&quot;, &quot;hi-jack&quot; airliners and attempt to wage biological and nuclear warfare. He concluded that &quot;the similarities between the Mysterons&#x27; terrorist tactics and our current real-life conflict are so striking, they become impossible to ignore.&quot; Commenting on the updated Mysterons of the 2005 remake, David Garland suggested that the aliens&#x27; persistent focus on terrorising Earth remotely, as opposed to invading it, &quot;holds particular contemporary resonance&quot;. Anderson rejected comparisons to 21st-century terrorism, stating that the Mysterons&#x27; methods are not terrorism &quot;as we know it&quot; but &quot;of an invisible force from another world&quot;. On parallels between the series and modern events, he argued that &quot;any film that has any kind of war or conflict is always timely, because we as human beings are forever killing each other&quot;.

<doc id="236093" wikidata="Q3268220" url="?curid=236093" title="Pump and dump">
<text>Pump and dump (P&amp;D) is a form of securities fraud that involves artificially inflating the price of an owned stock through false and misleading positive statements (pump), in order to sell the cheaply purchased stock at a higher price (dump). Once the operators of the scheme &quot;dump&quot; (sell) their overvalued shares, the price falls and investors lose their money. This is most common with small-cap cryptocurrencies and very small corporations/companies, i.e. &quot;microcaps&quot;.

While fraudsters in the past relied on cold calls, the Internet now offers a cheaper and easier way of reaching large numbers of potential investors through spam email, investment research websites, social media, and misinformation.

==Scenarios==
Pump-and-dump schemes do take place on the Internet using an email spam campaign, through media channels via a fake press release, or through telemarketing from &quot;boiler room&quot; brokerage houses (such as that dramatized in the 2000 film &quot;Boiler Room&quot;). Often the stock promoter will claim to have &quot;inside&quot; information about impending news. Newsletters would purport to offer unbiased recommendations, then tout a company as a &quot;hot&quot; stock, for their own benefit. Promoters also post messages in online chat groups or internet forums, urging readers to buy the stock quickly.

If a promoter&#x27;s campaign to &quot;pump&quot; a stock is successful, it will entice unwitting investors to purchase shares of the target company. The increased demand, price, and trading volume of the stock could convince more people to believe the hype and to buy shares as well. When the promoters behind the scheme sell (dump) their shares and stop promoting the stock, the price plummets, and other investors are left holding a stock that is worth significantly less than what they paid for it.

Fraudsters frequently use this ploy with small, thinly traded companies—known as &quot;penny stocks&quot;, generally traded over-the-counter (in the United States, this would mean markets such as the OTC Bulletin Board or the Pink Sheets), rather than markets such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or NASDAQ—because it is easier to manipulate a stock when there is little or no independent information available about the company. The same principle applies in the United Kingdom, where target companies are typically small companies on the AIM or OFEX.

A more modern spin on the attack is known as hack, pump and dump. In this form, a person purchases penny stocks and then uses compromised brokerage accounts to purchase large quantities of that stock. The net result is a price increase, often pushed further by day traders seeing a quick advance in a stock. The original stockholder then cashes out at a premium. Pump-and-dump schemes also permeate the crypto-market, targeting especially low-market-cap, coins on cryptocurrency exchanges.

===Examples===

====Stratton Oakmont====
In the early 1990s, the penny-stock brokerage Stratton Oakmont artificially inflated the price of owned stock through false and misleading positive statements in order to sell the cheaply purchased stock at a higher price. Firm co-founder Jordan Belfort was criminally convicted for applying the scheme. He later turned his story into a memoir, &quot;The Wolf of Wall Street&quot;, which was later adapted into an Academy Award–nominated film of the same name.

====Jonathan Lebed====
During the dot-com bubble, when the stock-market fever was at its height and many people spent significant amounts of time on stock Internet message boards, a 15-year-old named Jonathan Lebed allegedly used the Internet to run a successful pump and dump. Lebed bought penny stocks and then promoted them on message boards, pointing at the price increase. Allegedly, when other investors bought the stock, Lebed sold his for a profit, leaving the other investors holding the bag. He came to the attention of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which filed a civil suit against him alleging security manipulation. Lebed settled the charges by paying a fraction of his total gains. He neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing, but promised not to manipulate securities in the future.

====Enron====
As late as April 2001, before Enron collapsed, executives at the large energy company Enron participated in an elaborate pump and dump scheme. Studies of the anonymous messages posted on the Yahoo board dedicated to Enron revealed predictive messages that the company was akin to a house of cards, had &quot;fooled even the most sophisticated analysts&quot;, and that investors should bail out while the stock was good. After Enron falsely reported profits, which inflated the stock price, they covered the real numbers by using questionable accounting practices. Twenty-nine Enron executives sold overvalued stock for more than a billion dollars before the company went bankrupt.

====Park Financial Group and International Media Solutions, LLC====
Park Financial Group, Spear &amp; Jackson, and International Media Solutions, LLC were involved in a pump-and-dump scheme where the price per share increased by $14.00 and over 100,000 shares were traded each day, netting Spear &amp; Jackson around $3 million in profits. In 2005, Spear &amp; Jackson and International Media Solutions were fined over $8 million, including its two executive officers, Kermit J. Silva and Yolanda Velazquez, each paying an additional $420,000 out of their personal accounts. On December 5, 2007, Park and the company&#x27;s president were ordered to pay over $113,000 in fines and penalties.

====Langbar International====
Started as Crown Corporation, Langbar International was the biggest pump-and-dump fraud on the Alternative Investment Market, part of the London Stock Exchange. The company was at one point valued greater than $1 billion, based on supposed bank deposits in Brazil which did not exist. None of the chief conspirators were convicted, although their whereabouts are known. A who made a negligent false statement about the assets was convicted and banned from being a director. The investors who lost as much as £100 million sued one of the fraudsters and recovered £30 million.

====Morrie Tobin====
In April 2018, Morrie Tobin and others, using offshore accounts, gained over $165 million from a pump-and-dump scheme. When questioned by federal agents, Tobin told the agents that he was involved in another scheme implicating a soccer coach from Yale University, which in turn led to the 2019 college admissions bribery scandal. In February 2019, Tobin pled guilty to conspiracy and securities fraud. On June 7, 2019, a federal judge hit Tobin with a $4 million forfeiture.

====Cryptocurrency====

Being an unregulated market, and due to the concentration of a large amount of cryptocurrency in a small number of hands, the prices of many cryptocurrencies are sensitive to pump-and-dump schemes. There are organised pump-and-dump schemes run through social media platforms including Telegram and Discord.

====Spam====
Pump-and-dump stock scams are prevalent in spam, accounting for about 15% of spam e-mail messages. A survey of 75,000 unsolicited emails sent between January 2004 and July 2005 concluded that spammers could make an average return of 4.29% by using this method, while recipients who act on the spam message typically lose close to 5.5% of their investment within two days. A study by Böhme and Holz shows a similar effect. Stocks targeted by spam are almost always penny stocks, selling for less than $5 per share, not traded on major exchanges, thinly traded, and difficult or impossible to sell short. Spammers acquire stock before sending the messages and sell the day the message is sent.

===Comparison with other types of schemes===

A pump-and-dump scam is a type of economic bubble, with the main difference between this scheme and most other types of bubbles being that the pump-and-dump bubble is deliberately perpetrated by unlawful activity. A pump-and-dump scheme is similar in many ways to a Ponzi scheme (in that both types of scam use misrepresentations in an effort to enrich the promoters and/or initial investors with money from later investors), however, there are a number of differences between the schemes:
* Ponzi-type investments are privately traded, often between individuals who are known to one another, whereas pump-and-dump schemes are typically marketed to the general public and traded on public stock exchanges and the victims and perpetrators are not acquainted with each other.
* Ponzi schemes typically promise very specific returns on investments and/or include falsified records implying consistent and steady returns, whereas pump-and-dump schemes only come with general and/or implied promises of substantial profits.
* Ponzi schemes typically come with the expectation of profit over a relatively extended period and typically last for months, years or even decades before their inevitable collapse. By comparison, pump-and-dump scams are designed to make profits extremely quickly and are executed over weeks, days or even hours.
* Ponzi schemes are occasionally the result of investment vehicles that are originally intended to be legitimate but ultimately fail to perform as expected. By comparison, pump-and-dump schemes are invariably intended to be scams from their conception, although a fairly common tactic used by pump-and-dump schemers is to take over a once-legitimate business (one that is either failing or defunct), or even just its name, in order to pump and dump its stock.
* For all of the above reasons, Ponzi schemes tend to leave a far more extensive trail of evidence. They are typically much easier to prosecute after they are discovered, and often result in much stiffer criminal penalties.

Pump-and-dump scams differ from many other forms of spam (such as advance fee fraud emails and lottery scam messages) in that it does not require the recipient to contact the spammer to collect supposed &quot;winnings&quot;, or to transfer money from supposed bank accounts. This makes tracking the source of pump-and-dump spam difficult, and has also given rise to &quot;minimalist&quot; spam consisting of a small untraceable image file containing a picture of a stock symbol.

==Scalping and social media==

One variation of the pump-and-dump scam is known as &quot;scalping.&quot; In a scalping scheme, a stock promoter takes a position in a stock and then touts the stock without disclosing his or her intent to sell the stock. By recommending the stock (often, but not always, by providing inflated price targets or more generic promises of substantial returns), the promoter convinces others to purchase the stock, providing a temporary rise in share price and volume which allows the &quot;scalper&quot; to then sell his shares on unsuspecting investors and obtain a profit. Scalping scams are frequently effectuated through social media (e.g., Twitter), and may lead to both criminal and civil liability in the United States. Like other pump-and-dump schemes, scalping scams frequently target microcap stocks because their low volume allows relatively small purchase volumes to cause significant spikes in the share price. Given the rise of social media, scalping scams have become a significant focus of regulators in the United States in recent years.

==Short and distort==

Another variant of the pump-and-dump scam, the &quot;short and distort&quot; works in the opposite manner. Instead of first buying the stock, and then artificially raising its price before selling, in a &quot;short and distort&quot; the scammer first short-sells the stock, and then artificially &quot;lowers&quot; the price, using the same techniques as the pump and dump but using criticism or negative predictions regarding the stock. The scammer then covers their short position when they buy back the stock at a lower price.

==Regulation==
One method of regulating and restricting pump-and-dump manipulators is to target the category of stocks most often associated with this scheme. To that end, penny stocks have been the target of heightened enforcement efforts.

In the United States, regulators have defined a penny stock as a security that must meet a number of specific standards. The criteria include price, market capitalization, and minimum shareholder equity. Securities traded on a national stock exchange, regardless of price, are exempt from regulatory designation as a penny stock, since it is thought that exchange-traded securities are less vulnerable to manipulation. Therefore, Citigroup (NYSE:C) and other NYSE listed securities which traded below $1.00 during the market downturn of 2008–2009, while properly regarded as &quot;low priced&quot; securities, were not technically &quot;penny stocks&quot;. Although penny stock trading in the United States is now primarily controlled through rules and regulations enforced by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the genesis of this control is found in state securities law.

The State of Georgia was the first state to codify a comprehensive penny stock securities law. Secretary of State Max Cleland, whose office enforced state securities laws, was a principal proponent of the legislation. Representative Chesley V. Morton, the only stockbroker in the Georgia General Assembly at the time, was a principal sponsor of the bill in the Georgia House of Representatives. Georgia&#x27;s penny stock law was subsequently challenged in court. However, the law was eventually upheld in U.S. District Court, and the statute became the template for laws enacted in other states. Shortly thereafter, both FINRA and the SEC enacted comprehensive revisions of their penny stock regulations. These regulations proved effective in either shuttering or greatly restricting brokers/dealers, such as Blinder, Robinson &amp; Company, which specialized in the penny stocks sector. Meyer Blinder was jailed for securities fraud in 1992, after the collapse of his firm. However, sanctions under these specific regulations lack an effective means to address pump-and-dump schemes perpetrated by unregistered groups and individuals.

==In popular culture==
The 2000 film &quot;Boiler Room&quot; stars Giovanni Ribisi as Seth Davis, a young man who gets a job as a trainee at a small brokerage firm called J.T. Marlin. He finds out that the firm engages in pump-and-dump schemes, selling stocks for fake or defunct companies.

<text>Cochinchina or Cochin-China (, ; ; ; ; ) is a historical exonym for part of Vietnam, depending on the contexts, usually for [[Southern Vietnam]]. Sometimes it referred to the whole of Vietnam, but it was commonly used to refer to the region south of the Gianh River.

In the 17th and 18th centuries, Vietnam was divided between the Trịnh lords to the north and the Nguyễn lords to the south. The two domains bordered each other on the Son River. The northern section was called Tonkin by Europeans, and the southern part, , was called Cochinchina by most Europeans and Quinam by the Dutch.

Jean-Louis Taberd, in his 1838 map, called Tonkin as &quot;Cocincina exterior&quot; () and &quot;Cochin China&quot; as &quot;Cocincina interior&quot; (). In this classic 1838 map, the Gianh River is north of &quot;Lũy Sầy&quot; (an incorrect pronunciation and spelling of &quot;Lũy Thầy&quot;) demarcating &quot;Cocincina exterior&quot; (or &quot;Outer Annam&quot;) from &quot;Cocincina interior&quot; (or &quot;Inner Annam&quot;). A small river immediately north of &quot;Lũy Sầy&quot;, drawn but not annotated, was likely the Son River, a tributary to the Gianh River. 

Lower Cochinchina (), whose principal city is Saigon, is the newest territory of the Vietnamese people in the movement of (Southward expansion). This region was also the first part of Vietnam to be colonized by the French. Inaugurated as the [[French Cochinchina]] in 1862, this colonial administrative unit reached its full extent from 1867 and was a constituent territory of French Indochina from 1887 until early 1945. So during the French colonial period, the label &quot;Cochinchina&quot; moved further south, and came to refer exclusively to the southernmost part of Vietnam. Beside the French colony of Cochinchina, the two other parts of Vietnam at the time were the French protectorates of Annam (Central Vietnam) and Tonkin (Northern Vietnam). South Vietnam (also called ) was reorganized from the State of Vietnam after the Geneva Conference in 1954 by combining Lower Cochinchina with the southern part of Annam, the former protectorate.

==Background==
The conquest of the south of present-day Vietnam was a long process of territorial acquisition by the Vietnamese. It is called &quot;Nam tiến&quot; (Chinese characters: 南進, English meaning &quot;South[ern] Advance&quot;) by Vietnamese historians. Vietnam (then known as Đại Việt) greatly expanded its territory in 1470 under the emperor Lê Thánh Tông, at the expense of Champa. The next two hundred years was a time of territorial consolidation and civil war with only gradual expansion southwards.

In 1516, Portuguese traders sailing from Malacca landed in Da Nang, Đại Việt, and established a presence there. They named the area &quot;Cochin-China&quot;, borrowing the first part from the Malay &quot;Kuchi&quot;, &quot;Kochi&quot;, &quot;Kuci&quot;, or &quot;Koci&quot; (unrelated to Indian or Japanese cities of Kochi), which referred to all of Vietnam, and which in turn derived from the Chinese &quot;Jiāozhǐ&quot;, in Cantonese &quot;Kawci&quot;, pronounced &quot;Giao Chỉ&quot; in Vietnam. They appended the &quot;China&quot; specifier to distinguish the area from the city and the princely state of Cochin in India, their first headquarters in the Malabar Coast.

As a result of a civil war that started in 1520, the Emperor of China sent a commission to study the political status of Annam in 1536. As a consequence of the delivered report, he declared war against the Mạc dynasty. The nominal ruler of the Mạc died at the very time that the Chinese armies passed the frontiers of the kingdom in 1537, and his father, Mạc Đăng Dung (the real power in any case), hurried to submit to the Imperial will, and declared himself to be a vassal of China. The Chinese declared that both the Lê dynasty and the Mạc had a right to part of the lands and so they recognised the Lê rule in the southern part of Vietnam while at the same time recognising the Mạc rule in the northern part, which was called Tunquin (i.e. Tonkin). This was to be a feudatory state of China under the government of the Mạc.

However, this arrangement did not last long. In 1592, Trịnh Tùng, leading the Royal (Trịnh) army, conquered nearly all of the Mạc territory and moved the Lê kings back to the original capital of Hanoi. The Mạc only held on to a tiny part of north Vietnam until 1667, when Trịnh Tạc conquered the last Mạc lands.

== Cochinchina Kingdom of the Nguyen lords (1600–1774) ==
In 1600 after returning from Tonkin, lord Nguyễn Hoàng built his own government in the two southern provinces of Thuận Hóa and Quảng Nam, today in central Vietnam. In 1623, lord Nguyễn Phúc Nguyên established a trading community at Saigon, then called Prey Nakor, with the consent of the king of Cambodia, Chey Chettha II. Over the next 50 years, Vietnamese control slowly expanded in this area but only gradually as the Nguyễn were fighting a protracted civil war with the Trịnh lords in the north.

With the end of the war with the Trịnh, the Nguyễn were able to devote more effort (and military force) to conquest of the south. First, the remaining Champa territories were taken; next, the areas around the Mekong river were placed under Vietnamese control. At least three wars were fought between the Nguyễn lords and the Cambodian kings in the period 1715 to 1770 with the Vietnamese gaining more territory with each war. The wars all involved the much more powerful Siamese kings who fought on behalf of their vassals, the Cambodians.

During the late 18th century emerged the Tây Sơn Rebellion, coming out from the Nguyễn domain. In 1774, the Trịnh army captured the capital Phú Xuân of the Nguyễn realm, whose leaders then had to flee to Lower Cochinchina. The three brothers of Tây Sơn, former peasants, however, soon succeeded in conquering first the lands of the Nguyễn and then the lands of the Trịnh, briefly unifying Vietnam.

;Cochinchina Empire of the Nguyễn (1802–1862)

Final unification of Vietnam came under Nguyễn Phúc Ánh, a tenacious member of the Nguyễn noble family who fought for 25 years against the Tây Sơn and ultimately conquered the entire country in 1802. He ruled all of Vietnam under the name Gia Long. His son Minh Mạng reigned from 14 February 1820 until 20 January 1841 what was known to the British as Cochin China and to the Americans as hyphenated Cochin-China. In hopes of negotiating commercial treaties, the British in 1822 sent East India Company agent John Crawfurd, and the Americans in 1833 sent diplomatist Edmund Roberts, who returned in 1836. Neither envoy was fully cognizant of conditions within the country, and neither succeeded.

Gia Long&#x27;s successors (see the Nguyễn dynasty for details) repelled the Siamese from Cambodia and even annexed Phnom Penh and surrounding territory in the war between 1831 and 1834, but were forced to relinquish these conquests in the war between 1841 and 1845.

== Colonial Cochinchina: 1862–1945==
=== French conquest ===
For a series of complex reasons, the Second French Empire of Napoleon III, with the help of Spanish troops arriving from the Spanish East Indies, attacked Đà Nẵng (Tourane) of Nguyen Dynasty Vietnam in September 1858. Unable to occupy Đà Nẵng, the alliance moved to Lower Cochinchina in the South. On 17 February 1859, they captured Saigon. Later on, the French defeated the Nguyễn army at the Battle of Ky Hoa in 1861. The Vietnamese government was forced to cede the three southern Vietnamese provinces of Biên Hòa, Gia Định and Định Tường to France in the June 1862 Treaty of Saigon.
In 1867, French Admiral Pierre de la Grandière forced the Vietnamese to surrender three additional provinces, Châu Đốc, Hà Tiên and Vĩnh Long. With these three additions all of southern Vietnam and the Mekong Delta fell under French control.

=== French colony ===
In 1871 all the territories ceded to the French in southern Vietnam were incorporated as colony of Cochinchina, with Admiral Dupré as its first governor. As a result, the name &quot;Cochinchina&quot; came to refer exclusively to the southern third of Vietnam. (In Catholic ecclesiastical contexts Cochinchina still related to the older meaning of &quot;Đàng Trong&quot; until 1924 when the three Apostolic Vicariates of Northern, Eastern, and Western Cochinchina were renamed to Apostolic Vicariates of Huế, Qui Nhơn, and Saïgon).

In 1887, the colony became a confederal member of the Union of French Indochina. Unlike the protectorates of Annam (central Vietnam) and Tonkin (northern Vietnam), Cochinchina was ruled directly by the French, both &quot;de jure&quot; and &quot;de facto&quot;, and was represented by a deputy in the National Assembly in Paris. Within Indochina, Cochinchina was the territory with the greatest European presence. At its height, in 1940, it was estimated at 16,550 people, the vast majority living in Saigon.

The French authorities dispossessed Vietnamese landowners and peasants to ensure European control of the expansion of rice and rubber production. As they expanded in response to the increased rubber demand after the First World War, the European plantations recruited, as indentured labour, workers from &quot;the overcrowded villages of the Red River Delta in Tonkin and the coastal lowlands of Annam&quot;. These migrants brought south the influence of the Communist Party of Nguyen Ai Quoc (Ho Chi Minh), and of other underground nationalist parties (the &quot;Tan Viet&quot; and &quot;Việt Nam Quốc Dân Đảng&quot; – VNQDD). At the same time, the local peasantry were driven into debt servitude, and into plantation labour, by land and poll taxes. Such conditions contributed to the 1916 Cochinchina uprising, and to widespread agrarian and labor unrest in 1930-32. 

In 1936 the formation in France of the Popular Front government led by Leon Blum was accompanied by promises of colonial reform. Failure to deliver, helped generate further unrest culminating in the summer of 1937 in general dock and transport strikes. The left anti-colonial forces split between the Moscow-oriented Communist Party and their Trotskyist left opposition and, following the French declaration of war against Germany in September 1939 was suppressed. Under the slogan &quot;Land to the Tillers, Freedom for the workers and independence for Vietnam&quot;, in November 1940 the Communist Party in Cochinchina instigated a widespread insurrection. Fighting in the Mekong Delta continued until the end of the year.

==Southern Resistance War and incorporation into South Vietnam, 1945–1955 ==
Cochinchina was occupied by Japan during World War II (1941–45). After the Japanese surrender in August 1945, the Communist-front Viet Minh had declared a provisional government (a Southern Administrative Committee) in Saigon. In Saigon, the violence of a French restoration assisted by British and surrendered Japanese troops, triggered a general uprising on September 23. In the course of what became known as the Southern Resistance War (Nam Bộ kháng chiến) the Viet Minh defeated rival resistance forces but, by the end of 1945, had been pushed out of Saigon and major urban centres into the countryside.

After 1945, the status of Cochinchina was a subject of discord between France and Ho Chi Minh&#x27;s Viet Minh. In 1946, the French proclaimed Cochinchina an &quot;autonomous republic&quot;, which was one of the causes of the First Indochina War. In 1948, Cochinchina was renamed as the &quot;Provisional Government of Southern Vietnam&quot;. It was merged the next year with the Provisional Central Government of Vietnam, and the State of Vietnam, with former emperor Bảo Đại as head of state, was then officially established.

After the First Indochina War and temporary partition of Vietnam agreed at Geneva, with French and American patronage Cochinchina was merged in 1955 with Annam south of the 17th parallel to form the Republic of Vietnam, &quot;South Vietnam&quot;, under the presidency of Ngo Dinh Diem.

<doc id="236095" wikidata="Q845764" url="?curid=236095" title="SYN flood">
<text>A SYN flood is a form of denial-of-service attack on data communications in which an attacker rapidly initiates a connection to a server without finalizing the connection. The server has to spend resources waiting for half-opened connections, which can consume enough resources to make the system unresponsive to legitimate traffic.

The packet that the attacker sends is the codice_1 packet, a part of TCP&#x27;s three-way handshake used to establish a connection. 

==Technical details==
When a client attempts to start a TCP connection to a server, the client and server exchange a series of messages which normally runs like this:

#The client requests a connection by sending a codice_2 (&quot;synchronize&quot;) message to the server.
#The server &quot;acknowledges&quot; this request by sending codice_3 back to the client.
#The client responds with an codice_4, and the connection is established.

This is called the TCP three-way handshake, and is the foundation for every connection established using the TCP protocol.

A SYN flood attack works by not responding to the server with the expected codice_4 code. The malicious client can either simply not send the expected codice_4, or by spoofing the source IP address in the codice_2, cause the server to send the codice_3 to a falsified IP address – which will not send an codice_4 because it &quot;knows&quot; that it never sent a codice_2.

The server will wait for the acknowledgement for some time, as simple network congestion could also be the cause of the missing codice_4. However, in an attack, the &quot;half-open connections&quot; created by the malicious client bind resources on the server and may eventually exceed the resources available on the server. At that point, the server cannot connect to any clients, whether legitimate or otherwise. This effectively denies service to legitimate clients. Some systems may also malfunction or crash when other operating system functions are starved of resources in this way.

==Countermeasures==
There are a number of well-known countermeasures listed in RFC 4987 including:

#Filtering
#Increasing backlog
#Reducing SYN-RECEIVED timer
#Recycling the oldest half-open TCP
#SYN cache
#SYN cookies
#Hybrid approaches
#Firewalls and proxies

<text>Cocksucker Blues is an unreleased documentary film directed by the still photographer Robert Frank chronicling The Rolling Stones American Tour 1972 in support of their album &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot;

==Production==
There was much anticipation for the band&#x27;s arrival in the United States, since they had not visited there since the 1969 disaster at the Altamont Free Concert in which a fan was stabbed and beaten to death by Hells Angels and the incident was caught on camera. Behind the scenes, the tour embodied debauchery, lewdness and hedonism.

The film was shot &quot;cinéma vérité&quot;, with several cameras available for anyone in the entourage to pick up and start shooting. This allowed the film&#x27;s audience to witness backstage parties, drug use (Mick Taylor is shown smoking marijuana with some roadies and Mick Jagger seen snorting cocaine backstage), roadie and groupie antics, and the Stones with their defences down. One scene includes a groupie in a hotel room injecting heroin.

==Fate==
The film came under a court order which forbade it from being shown unless the director, Robert Frank, was physically present. This ruling stemmed from the conflict that arose when the band, having commissioned the film, decided that its content was embarrassing and potentially incriminating, and did not want it shown. Frank felt otherwise, hence the ruling.

According to Ray Young, &quot;The salty title notwithstanding, its nudity, needles and hedonism was supposedly incriminating and the picture was shelved—this during a liberal climate that saw the likes of &quot;Cry Uncle!&quot; and &quot;Chafed Elbows&quot; playing in neighborhood theatres.&quot; &quot;Deep Throat&quot; was released in the same year. A Rolling Stones concert film, &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen: The Rolling Stones&quot;, was released instead, and &quot;Cocksucker Blues&quot; was indefinitely shelved.

The court order in question also enjoined Frank against exhibiting &quot;Cocksucker Blues&quot; more frequently than four times per year in an &quot;archival setting&quot; with Frank being present. Frank personally introduced one such rare screening of the film on February 23, 1988 at Boston&#x27;s Cinema 57 theater in Park Square in conjunction with promoting the release that week of his new film, &quot;Candy Mountain&quot;.

Other screenings have included the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York on October 3, 2009 (curator Jeff Rosenheim, introducing the movie, mentioned that Robert Frank was &quot;in the building,&quot; but pointed out that the building was over ), the Museum of Modern Art in New York in November 2012 as part of a two-week festival, &quot;The Rolling Stones: 50 Years on Film&quot;, the Cleveland Cinematheque on November 15, 2013, the Chuck Jones Theater during the 2015 Telluride Film Festival, and the Rotterdam, Netherlands 2015 International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam (IDFA) as part of a Robert Frank retrospective, with Frank in attendance.

<doc id="236098" wikidata="Q1332977" url="?curid=236098" title="Subsequence">
<text>In mathematics, a subsequence of a given sequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, the sequence formula_1 is a subsequence of formula_2 obtained after removal of elements formula_3 formula_4 and formula_5 The relation of one sequence being the subsequence of another is a partial order.

Subsequences can contain consecutive elements which were not consecutive in the original sequence. A subsequence which consists of a consecutive run of elements from the original sequence, such as formula_6 from formula_7 is a substring. The substring is a refinement of the subsequence.

The list of all subsequences for the word &quot;apple&quot; would be &quot;&quot;a&quot;, &quot;ap&quot;, &quot;al&quot;, &quot;ae&quot;, &quot;app&quot;, &quot;apl&quot;, &quot;ape&quot;, &quot;ale&quot;, &quot;appl&quot;, &quot;appe&quot;, &quot;aple&quot;, &quot;apple&quot;, &quot;p&quot;, &quot;pp&quot;, &quot;pl&quot;, &quot;pe&quot;, &quot;ppl&quot;, &quot;ppe&quot;, &quot;ple&quot;, &quot;pple&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, &quot;le&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot; (empty string).

== Common subsequence ==

Given two sequences formula_8 and formula_9 a sequence formula_10 is said to be a &quot;common subsequence&quot; of formula_8 and formula_9 if formula_10 is a subsequence of both formula_8 and formula_15 For example, if
formula_16
formula_17
formula_18
then formula_10 is said to be a common subsequence of formula_8 and formula_15

This would be the &quot;longest common subsequence&quot;, since formula_10 only has length 3, and the common subsequence formula_23 has length 4. The longest common subsequence of formula_8 and formula_25 is formula_26

== Applications ==

Subsequences have applications to computer science, especially in the discipline of bioinformatics, where computers are used to compare, analyze, and store DNA, RNA, and protein sequences.

Take two sequences of DNA containing 37 elements, say:

:&lt;samp&gt;SEQ1 = ACGGTGTCGTGCTATGCTGATGCTGACTTATATGCTA&lt;/samp&gt;
:&lt;samp&gt;SEQ2 = CGTTCGGCTATCGTACGTTCTATTCTATGATTTCTAA&lt;/samp&gt;

The longest common subsequence of sequences 1 and 2 is:

:&lt;samp&gt;LCS(SEQ1,SEQ2) = CGTTCGGCTATGCTTCTACTTATTCTA&lt;/samp&gt;

This can be illustrated by highlighting the 27 elements of the longest common subsequence into the initial sequences:

:&lt;samp&gt;SEQ1 = A&#x27;G&#x27;G&#x27;T&#x27;GA&#x27;G&#x27;G&#x27;A&#x27;G&lt;/samp&gt;
:&lt;samp&gt;SEQ2 = &#x27;C&#x27;TA&#x27;G&#x27;TT&#x27;A&#x27;G&#x27;T&#x27;A&lt;/samp&gt;

Another way to show this is to &quot;align&quot; the two sequences, that is, to position elements of the longest common subsequence in a same column (indicated by the vertical bar) and to introduce a special character (here, a dash) for padding of arisen empty subsequences:
:&lt;samp&gt;SEQ1 = ACGGTGTCGTGCTAT-G--C-TGATGCTGA--CT-T-ATATG-CTA-&lt;/samp&gt;
:&lt;samp&gt;        | || ||| ||||| |  | |  | || |  || | || |  ||| &lt;/samp&gt;
:&lt;samp&gt;SEQ2 = -C-GT-TCG-GCTATCGTACGT--T-CT-ATTCTATGAT-T-TCTAA&lt;/samp&gt;

Subsequences are used to determine how similar the two strands of DNA are, using the DNA bases: adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine.

== Theorems ==

* Every infinite sequence of real numbers has an infinite monotone subsequence (This is a lemma used in the proof of the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem).
* Every infinite bounded sequence in formula_27 has a convergent subsequence (This is the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem).
* For all integers formula_28 and formula_29 every finite sequence of length at least formula_30 contains a monotonically increasing subsequence of length formula_28 a monotonically decreasing subsequence of length formula_32 (This is the Erdős–Szekeres theorem).
* A metric space formula_33 is compact if every sequence in formula_8 has a convergent subsequence whose limit is in formula_8.

<text>The Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN; Kyūjitai: Shinjitai: &quot;&quot; &#x27;Navy of the Greater Japanese Empire&#x27;, or &quot;Nippon Kaigun&quot;, &#x27;Japanese Navy&#x27;) was the navy of the Empire of Japan from 1868 to 1945, when it was dissolved following Japan&#x27;s surrender in World War II. The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) was formed between 1952 and 1954 after the dissolution of the IJN.

The IJN was the third largest navy in the world by 1920, behind the Royal Navy and the United States Navy (USN). It was supported by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service for reconnaissance and airstrike operations from the fleet. It was the primary opponent of the Western Allies in the Pacific War. The IJN additionally fielded limited land-based forces, including professional marines, marine paratrooper units, anti-aircraft defense units, installation and port security units, naval police units, and ad-hoc formations of sailors pressed into service as naval infantry.

The origins of the IJN date back to early interactions with nations on the Asian continent, beginning in the early feudal period and reaching a peak of activity during the 16th and 17th centuries at a time of cultural exchange with European powers during the Age of Discovery. After two centuries of stagnation during the country&#x27;s ensuing seclusion policy under the &quot;shōgun&quot; of the Edo period, Japan&#x27;s navy was comparatively antiquated when the country was forced open to trade by American intervention in 1854. This eventually led to the Meiji Restoration. Accompanying the re-ascendance of the Emperor came a period of frantic modernization and industrialization. The IJN saw several successes in combat during the early twentieth century, sometimes against much more powerful enemies, such as in the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War, before being largely destroyed in World War II.

==Origins==

Japan has a long history of naval interaction with the Asian continent, involving transportation of troops between Korea and Japan, starting at least with the beginning of the Kofun period in the 3rd century.

Following the attempts at Mongol invasions of Japan by Kubilai Khan in 1274 and 1281, Japanese &quot;wakō&quot; became very active in plundering the coast of China. In response to threats of Chinese invasion of Japan, in 1405 the shogun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu capitulated to Chinese demands and sent twenty captured Japanese pirates to China, where they were boiled in a cauldron in Ningbo.

Japan undertook major naval building efforts in the 16th century, during the Warring States period when feudal rulers vying for supremacy built vast coastal navies of several hundred ships. Around that time Japan may have developed one of the first ironclad warships when Oda Nobunaga, a &quot;daimyō&quot;, had six iron-covered Oatakebune made in 1576. In 1588 Toyotomi Hideyoshi issued a ban on Wakō piracy; the pirates then became vassals of Hideyoshi, and comprised the naval force used in the Japanese invasion of Korea (1592–1598).

Japan built her first large ocean-going warships in the beginning of the 17th century, following contacts with the Western nations during the Nanban trade period. In 1613, the &quot;daimyō&quot; of Sendai, in agreement with the Tokugawa Bakufu, built &quot;Date Maru&quot;, a 500-ton galleon-type ship that transported the Japanese embassy of Hasekura Tsunenaga to the Americas, which then continued to Europe. From 1604 the Bakufu also commissioned about 350 Red seal ships, usually armed and incorporating some Western technologies, mainly for Southeast Asian trade.

===Western studies and the end of seclusion===

For more than 200 years, beginning in the 1640s, the Japanese policy of seclusion (&quot;&quot;sakoku&quot;) forbade contacts with the outside world and prohibited the construction of ocean-going ships on pain of death. Contacts were maintained, however, with the Dutch through the port of Nagasaki, the Chinese also through Nagasaki and the Ryukyus and Korea through intermediaries with Tsushima. The study of Western sciences, called &quot;rangaku&quot;&quot; through the Dutch enclave of Dejima in Nagasaki led to the transfer of knowledge related to the Western technological and scientific revolution which allowed Japan to remain aware of naval sciences, such as cartography, optics and mechanical sciences. Seclusion, however, led to the loss of any naval and maritime traditions the nation possessed.

Apart from Dutch trade ships, no other Western vessels were allowed to enter Japanese ports. A notable exception was during the Napoleonic wars when neutral ships flew the Dutch flag. Frictions with the foreign ships, however, started from the beginning of the 19th century. The Nagasaki Harbour Incident involving in 1808, and other subsequent incidents in the following decades, led the shogunate to enact an Edict to Repel Foreign Vessels. Western ships, which were increasing their presence around Japan due to whaling and the trade with China, began to challenge the seclusion policy.

The Morrison Incident in 1837 and news of China&#x27;s defeat during the Opium War led the shogunate to repeal the 1825 law to repel the foreign ships, and instead to adopt the 1842 Edict for the Provision of Firewood and Water that recognized the need to provide basic provisions for the visiting foreign ships. The shogunate also began to strengthen the nation&#x27;s coastal defenses. Many Japanese realized that traditional ways would not be sufficient to repel further intrusions, and western knowledge was utilized through the Dutch at Dejima to reinforce Japan&#x27;s capability to repel the foreigners; field guns, mortars, and firearms were obtained, and coastal defenses reinforced. Numerous attempts to open Japan ended in failure, in part to Japanese resistance, until the early 1850s.

As a part of the effort to strengthen coastal defense, western-style sailship Sōshun Maru, a small twin-mast military vessel with 22 oars, two mortar and six Japanese made Carronade-like smoothbore guns, length of 16.7m and beam of 3.9m, was built in 1849. Sōshun Maru was lost in a fire in 1850, but the design was mostly copied by nine more vessels for the protection of Edo Bay by 1853, mostly under Uraga regional office of the government manned by samurais from Aizu Han.

During 1853 and 1854, American warships under the command of Commodore Matthew Perry, entered Edo Bay and made demonstrations of force requesting trade negotiations. After two hundred years of seclusion, the 1854 Convention of Kanagawa led to the opening of Japan to international trade and interaction. This was soon followed by the 1858 Treaty of Amity and Commerce and treaties with other powers.

===Development of shogunal and domain naval forces===

As soon as Japan opened up to foreign influences, the Tokugawa shogunate recognized the vulnerability of the country from the sea and initiated an active policy of assimilation and adoption of Western naval technologies. In 1855, with Dutch assistance, the shogunate acquired its first steam warship, , and began using it for training, establishing a Naval Training Center at Nagasaki.

Samurai such as the future Admiral Enomoto Takeaki (1836–1908) was sent by the shogunate to study in the Netherlands for several years. On 8 May 1857, another Naval Training Center was completed in Edo, and the school relocated to this new facility in Tsukiji. In 1857 the shogunate acquired its first screw-driven steam warship and used it as an escort for the 1860 Japanese delegation to the United States. In 1865 the French naval engineer Léonce Verny was hired to build Japan&#x27;s first modern naval arsenals, at Yokosuka and Nagasaki.

The shogunate also allowed and then ordered various domains to purchase warships and to develop naval fleets, Satsuma, especially, had petitioned the shogunate to build modern naval vessels. A naval center had been set up by the Satsuma domain in Kagoshima, students were sent abroad for training and a number of ships were acquired. The domains of Chōshū, Hizen, Tosa and Kaga joined Satsuma in acquiring ships. These naval elements proved insufficient during the Royal Navy&#x27;s Bombardment of Kagoshima in 1863 and the Allied bombardments of Shimonoseki in 1863–64.

By the mid-1860s the shogunate had a fleet of eight warships and thirty-six auxiliaries. Satsuma (which had the largest domain fleet) had nine steamships, Choshu had five ships plus numerous auxiliary craft, Kaga had ten ships and Chikuzen eight. Numerous smaller domains also had acquired a number of ships. However, these fleets resembled maritime organizations rather than actual navies with ships functioning as transports as well as combat vessels; they were also manned by personnel who lacked experienced seamanship except for coastal sailing and who had virtually no combat training.

== Creation of the Imperial Japanese Navy (1868–72) ==

The Meiji Restoration in 1868 led to the overthrow of the shogunate. From 1868, the newly formed Meiji government continued with reforms to centralize and modernize Japan.

===Boshin War===


Although the Meiji reformers had overthrown the Tokugawa shogunate, tensions between the former ruler and the restoration leaders led to the Boshin War (January 1868 to June 1869). The early part of the conflict largely involved land battles, with naval forces playing a minimal role transporting troops from western to eastern Japan. Only the Battle of Awa (28 January 1868) was significant; this also proved one of the few Tokugawa successes in the war. Tokugawa Yoshinobu eventually surrendered after the fall of Edo in July 1868, and as a result most of Japan accepted the emperor&#x27;s rule, however resistance continued in the North.

On 26 March 1868 the first naval review in Japan took place in Osaka Bay, with six ships from the private domain navies of Saga, Chōshū, Satsuma, Kurume, Kumamoto and Hiroshima participating. The total tonnage of these ships was 2,252 tons, which was far smaller than the tonnage of the single foreign vessel (from the French Navy) that also participated. The following year, in July 1869, the Imperial Japanese Navy was formally established, two months after the last combat of the Boshin War.

Enomoto Takeaki, the admiral of the &quot;shōgun&quot;″s navy, refused to surrender all his ships, remitting just four vessels, and escaped to northern Honshū with the remnants of the &quot;shōgun&quot;″s navy: eight steam warships and 2,000 men. Following the defeat of pro-shogunate resistance on Honshū, Admiral Enomoto Takeaki fled to Hokkaidō, where he established the breakaway Republic of Ezo (27 January 1869). The new Meiji government dispatched a military force to defeat the rebels, culminating with the Naval Battle of Hakodate in May 1869. The Imperial side took delivery (February 1869) of the French-built ironclad &quot;Kotetsu&quot; (originally ordered by the Tokugawa shogunate) and used it decisively towards the end of the conflict.

=== Consolidation ===

In February 1868 the Imperial government had placed all captured shogunate naval vessels under the Navy Army affairs section. In the following months, military forces of the government came under the control of several organizations which were established and then disbanded until the establishment of the Ministry of War and of the Ministry of the Navy of Japan in 1872. For the first two years (1868–1870) of the Meiji state no national, centrally controlled navy existed, – the Meiji government only administered those Tokugawa vessels captured in the early phase of the Boshin War of 1868–1869. All other naval vessels remained under the control of the various domains which had been acquired during the Bakumatsu period. The naval forces mirrored the political environment of Japan at the time: the domains retained their political as well as military independence from the Imperial government. Katsu Kaishū a former Tokugawa navy leader, was brought into the government as Vice Minister of the Navy in 1872, and became the first Minister of the Navy from 1873 until 1878 because of his naval experience and his ability to control Tokugawa personnel who retained positions in the government naval forces. Upon assuming office Katsu Kaishu recommended the rapid centralization of all naval forces – government and domain – under one agency. The nascent Meiji government in its first years did not have the necessary political and military force to implement such a policy and so, like much of the government, the naval forces retained a decentralized structure in most of 1869 through 1870.

The incident involving Enomoto Takeaki&#x27;s refusal to surrender and his escape to Hokkaidō with a large part of the former Tokugawa Navy&#x27;s best warships embarrassed the Meiji government politically. The imperial side had to rely on considerable naval assistance from the most powerful domains as the government did not have enough naval power to put down the rebellion on its own. Although the rebel forces in Hokkaidō surrendered, the government&#x27;s response to the rebellion demonstrated the need for a strong centralized naval force. Even before the rebellion the restoration leaders had realized the need for greater political, economic and military centralization and by August 1869 most of the domains had returned their lands and population registers to the government. In 1871 the domains were abolished altogether and as with the political context the centralization of the navy began with the domains donating their forces to the central government. As a result, in 1871 Japan could finally boast a centrally controlled navy, this was also the institutional beginning of the Imperial Japanese Navy.

In February 1872, the Ministry of War was replaced by a separate Army Ministry and Navy Ministry. In October 1873, Katsu Kaishū became Navy Minister.

== Secondary Service (1872–1882) ==
After the consolidation of the government the new Meiji state set about to build up national strength. The Meiji government honored the treaties with the Western powers signed during the Bakumatsu period with the ultimate goal of revising them, leading to a subsided threat from the sea. This however led to conflict with those disgruntled samurai who wanted to expel the westerners and with groups which opposed the Meiji reforms. Internal dissent – including peasant uprisings – become a greater concern for the government, which curtailed plans for naval expansion as a result. In the immediate period from 1868 many members of the Meiji coalition advocated giving preference to maritime forces over the army and saw naval strength as paramount. In 1870 the new government drafted an ambitious plan to develop a navy with 200 ships organized into ten fleets. The plan was abandoned within a year due to lack of resources. Financial considerations were a major factor restricting the growth of the navy during the 1870s. Japan at the time was not a wealthy state. Soon, however, domestic rebellions, the Saga Rebellion (1874) and especially the Satsuma Rebellion (1877), forced the government to focus on land warfare, and the army gained prominence.

Naval policy, as expressed by the slogan &quot;Shusei Kokubō&quot; (literally: &quot;Static Defense&quot;), focused on coastal defenses, on a standing army (established with the assistance of the second French Military Mission to Japan), and a coastal navy that could act in a supportive role to drive an invading enemy from the coast. The resulting military organization followed the &quot;Rikushu Kaijū&quot; (Army first, Navy second) principle. This meant a defense designed to repel an enemy from Japanese territory, and the chief responsibility for that mission rested upon Japan&#x27;s army; consequently, the army gained the bulk of the military expenditures. During the 1870s and 1880s, the Imperial Japanese Navy remained an essentially coastal-defense force, although the Meiji government continued to modernize it. &quot;Jo Sho Maru&quot; (soon renamed &quot;Ryūjō Maru&quot;) commissioned by Thomas Glover was launched at Aberdeen, Scotland on 27 March 1869.

=== British support and influence ===
In 1870 an Imperial decree determined that Britain&#x27;s Royal Navy should serve as the model for development, instead of the Netherlands navy. In 1873 a thirty-four-man British naval mission, headed by Lt. Comdr. Archibald Douglas, arrived in Japan. Douglas directed instruction at the Naval Academy at Tsukiji for several years, the mission remained in Japan until 1879, substantially advancing the development of the navy and firmly establishing British traditions within the Japanese navy from matters of seamanship to the style of its uniforms and the attitudes of its officers.

From September 1870, the English Lieutenant Horse, a former gunnery instructor for the Saga fief during the Bakumatsu period, was put in charge of gunnery practice on board the &quot;Ryūjō&quot;. In 1871, the ministry resolved to send 16 trainees abroad for training in naval sciences (14 to Great Britain, two to the United States), among whom was Heihachirō Tōgō. In 1879, Commander L. P. Willan was hired to train naval cadets.

Ships such as the , and were built in British shipyards, and they were the first warships built abroad specifically for the Imperial Japanese Navy. Private construction companies such as Ishikawajima and Kawasaki also emerged around this time.

=== First interventions abroad (Taiwan 1874, Korea 1875–76) ===
During 1873, a plan to invade the Korean Peninsula, the &quot;Seikanron&quot; proposal made by Saigō Takamori, was narrowly abandoned by decision of the central government in Tokyo. In 1874, the Taiwan expedition was the first foray abroad of the new Imperial Japanese Navy and Army after the Mudan Incident of 1871, however the navy served largely as a transport force.

Various interventions in the Korean Peninsula continued in 1875–1876, starting with the Ganghwa Island incident provoked by the Japanese gunboat , leading to the dispatch of a large force of the Imperial Japanese Navy. As a result, the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1876 was signed, marking the official opening of Korea to foreign trade, and Japan&#x27;s first example of Western-style interventionism and adoption of &quot;unequal treaties&quot; tactics.

In 1878, the Japanese cruiser &quot;Seiki&quot; sailed to Europe with an entirely Japanese crew.

==Naval expansion (1882–1893)==


===First naval expansion bill===

After the Imo Incident in July 1882, Iwakura Tomomi submitted a document to the &quot;daijō-kan&quot; titled &quot;Opinions Regarding Naval Expansion&quot; asserting that a strong navy was essential to maintaining the security of Japan. In furthering his argument, Iwakura suggested that domestic rebellions were no longer Japan&#x27;s primary military concern and that naval affairs should take precedence over army concerns; a strong navy was more important than a sizable army to preserve the Japanese state. Furthermore, he justified that a large, modern navy, would have the added potential benefit of instilling Japan with greater international prestige and recognition, as navies were internationally recognized hallmarks of power and status. Iwakura also suggested that the Meiji government could support naval growth by increasing taxes on tobacco, sake, and soy.

After lengthy discussions, Iwakura eventually convinced the ruling coalition to support Japan&#x27;s first multi-year naval expansion plan in history. In May 1883, the government approved a plan that, when completed, would add 32 warships over eight years at a cost of just over ¥26 million. This development was very significant for the navy, as the amount allocated virtually equaled the navy&#x27;s entire budget between 1873 and 1882. The 1882 naval expansion plan succeeded in a large part because of Satsuma power, influence, and patronage. Between 19 August and 23 November 1882, Satsuma forces with Iwakura&#x27;s leadership, worked tirelessly to secure support for the Navy&#x27;s expansion plan. After uniting the other Satsuma members of the Dajokan, Iwakura approached the emperor the Meiji emperor arguing persuasively just as he did with the Dajokan, that naval expansion was critical to Japan&#x27;s security and that the standing army of forty thousand men was more than sufficient for domestic purposes. While the government should direct the lion&#x27;s share of future military appropriations toward naval matters, a powerful navy would legitimize an increase in tax revenue. On November 24, the emperor assembled select ministers of the &quot;daijō-kan&quot; together with military officers, and announced the need for increased tax revenues to provide adequate funding for military expansion, this was followed by an imperial re-script. The following month, in December, an annual ¥7.5-million tax increase on sake, soy, and tobacco was fully approved, in the hopes that it would provide ¥3.5 million annually for warship construction and ¥2.5 million for warship maintenance. In February 1883, the government directed further revenues from other ministries to support an increase in the navy&#x27;s warship construction and purchasing budget. By March 1883, the navy secured the ¥6.5 million required annually to support an eight-year expansion plan, this was the largest that the Imperial Japanese Navy had secured in its young existence.

However, naval expansion remained a highly contentious issue for both the government and the navy throughout much of the 1880s. Overseas advances in naval technology increased the costs of purchasing large components of a modern fleet, so that by 1885 cost overruns had jeopardized the entire 1883 plan. Furthermore, increased costs coupled with decreased domestic tax revenues, heightened concern and political tension in Japan regarding funding naval expansion.
In 1883, two large warships were ordered from British shipyards.

The and were 3,650 ton ships. They were capable of speeds up to and were armed with deck armor and two Krupp guns. The naval architect Sasō Sachū designed these on the line of the Elswick class of protected cruisers but with superior specifications. An arms race was taking place with China however, who equipped herself with two 7,335 ton German-built battleships (&quot;Ting Yüan&quot; and &quot;Chen-Yüan&quot;). Unable to confront the Chinese fleet with only two modern cruisers, Japan resorted to French assistance to build a large, modern fleet which could prevail in the upcoming conflict.

===Influence of the French &quot;Jeune École&quot; (1880s)===


During the 1880s, France took the lead in influence, due to its &quot;Jeune École&quot; (&quot;young school&quot;) doctrine, favoring small, fast warships, especially cruisers and torpedo boats, against bigger units. The choice of France may also have been influenced by the Minister of the Navy, who happened to be Enomoto Takeaki at that time (Navy Minister 1880–1885), a former ally of the French during the Boshin War. Also, Japan was uneasy with being dependent on Great Britain, at a time when Great Britain was very close to China.

The &quot;Meiji&quot; government issued its First Naval Expansion bill in 1882, requiring the construction of 48 warships, of which 22 were to be torpedo boats. The naval successes of the French Navy against China in the Sino-French War of 1883–85 seemed to validate the potential of torpedo boats, an approach which was also attractive to the limited resources of Japan. In 1885, the new Navy slogan became &quot;Kaikoku Nippon&quot; (Jp:海国日本, &quot;Maritime Japan&quot;).

In 1885, the leading French Navy engineer Émile Bertin was hired for four years to reinforce the Japanese Navy and to direct the construction of the arsenals of Kure and Sasebo. He developed the &quot;Sankeikan&quot; class of cruisers; three units featuring a single powerful main gun, the Canet gun. Altogether, Bertin supervised the building of more than 20 units. They helped establish the first true modern naval force of Japan. It allowed Japan to achieve mastery in the building of large units, since some of the ships were imported, and some others were built domestically at the arsenal of Yokosuka:
* 3 cruisers: the 4,700 ton and , built in France, and the , built at Yokosuka.
* 3 coastal warships of 4,278 tons.
* 2 small cruisers: the , a small cruiser of 2,439 tons built in Britain, and the , 1,800 tons, built at Yokosuka.
* 1 frigate, the 1,600 ton , built at Yokosuka.
* 1 aviso: the 726 ton , built in France.
* 16 torpedo boats of 54 tons each, built in France by the Companie du Creusot in 1888, and assembled in Japan.

This period also allowed Japan &quot;to embrace the revolutionary new technologies embodied in torpedoes, torpedo-boats and mines, of which the French at the time were probably the world&#x27;s best exponents&quot;. Japan acquired its first torpedoes in 1884, and established a &quot;Torpedo Training Center&quot; at Yokosuka in 1886.

These ships, ordered during the fiscal years 1885 and 1886, were the last major orders placed with France. The unexplained sinking of &quot;en route&quot; from France to Japan in December 1886, created embarrassment however.

===British shipbuilding===

Japan turned again to Britain, with the order of a revolutionary torpedo boat, , which was considered the first effective design of a destroyer, in 1887 and with the purchase of , built at the Armstrong works in Elswick, Newcastle upon Tyne, the fastest cruiser in the world at the time of her launch in 1892. In 1889, she ordered the Clyde-built , which defined the type for armored cruisers.

Between 1882 and 1918, ending with the visit of the French Military Mission to Japan, the Imperial Japanese Navy stopped relying on foreign instructors altogether. In 1886, she manufactured her own prismatic powder, and in 1892 one of her officers invented a powerful explosive, the Shimose powder.

==First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895)==
Japan continued the modernization of its navy, especially driven by Chinese efforts to construct a powerful modern fleet with foreign (especially German) assistance, and as a result tensions began to rise between the two countries over competing interests in Korea. The Japanese naval leadership was generally cautious and even apprehensive at the prospect of hostilities with China, as the navy had not yet received several modern warships that had been ordered in February 1893, particularly the battleships and and the cruiser . Hence, initiating hostilities at this time was perceived as ill-advised, and the navy was far less confident than their counterparts in the Japanese army about the outcome of a war with China.

Japan&#x27;s main strategy was to swiftly obtain naval superiority, as this was critical to the success of operations on land. An early victory over the Beiyang fleet would allow Japan to transport troops and material to the Korean Peninsula; additionally, the Japanese judged that a protracted war with China would increase the risk of intervention by the European powers with interests in East Asia. The army&#x27;s Fifth Division would land at Chemulpo on the western coast of Korea, both to engage and push Chinese forces northwest up the peninsula and to draw the Beiyang Fleet into the Yellow Sea, where it would be engaged in decisive battle. Depending upon the outcome of this engagement, Japanese decisionmakers anticipated that they would be faced with one of three choices. If the Combined Fleet were to win decisively at sea, the larger part of the Japanese army could immediately land in force on the Korean coast between Shanhaiguan and Tianjin in order to defeat the Chinese army and bring the war to a swift conclusion. If the naval engagement was a draw, and neither side gained decisive control of the sea, army units in Korea would concentrate on maintaining preexisting positions. Lastly, if the Combined Fleet was defeated and consequently lost command of the sea, the bulk of the army would remain in Japan and prepare to repel a Chinese invasion, while the Fifth Division in Korea would be ordered to dig in and fight a rearguard action.

A Japanese squadron intercepted and defeated a Chinese naval force near Korean island of Pungdo, damaging a cruiser, sinking a loaded transport, capturing one gunboat and destroying another. This battle occurred before war was officially declared on 1 August 1894. On 10 August, the Japanese ventured into the Yellow Sea to seek out the Beiyang Fleet, and subsequently bombarded both Weihaiwei and Port Arthur. Finding only small vessels in both harbors, the Combined Fleet returned to Korea to support further landings off the Chinese coast. The Beiyang Fleet, under the command of Admiral Ding, was initially ordered to remain close to the Chinese coast while reinforcements were sent to Korea by land. However, as Japanese troops swiftly advanced northward from Seoul to Pyongyang, the Chinese decided to rush troops to Korea by sea under a naval escort in mid-September.
Concurrently, because there not yet been a decisive encounter at sea, the Japanese decided to send more troops to Korea. Early in September, the Japanese navy was directed to initiate further landings and to support the army on Korea&#x27;s western coast. As Japanese ground forces moved north to attack Pyongyang, Admiral Ito correctly guessed that the Chinese would attempt to reinforce their army in Korea by sea. On 14 September, the Combined Fleet sailed north to search the Korean and Chinese coasts and bring the Beiyang Fleet to battle. On 17 September 1894, the Japanese encountered the Beiyang Fleet off the mouth of the Yalu River. The Beiyang Fleet was crippled during the ensuing battle, in which the Chinese lost eight out of 12 warships. The Chinese subsequently withdrew behind the Weihaiwei fortifications. However, they were then surprised by Japanese troops, who had outflanked the harbor&#x27;s defenses in coordination with the navy. The remnants of the Beiyang Fleet were destroyed at Weihaiwei. Although Japan had emerged victorious at sea, the two large German-made Chinese ironclad battleships (&quot;Dingyuan&quot; and &quot;Zhenyuan&quot;) had remained almost impervious to Japanese guns, highlighting the need for bigger capital ships in the Imperial Japanese Navy. The next step of the Imperial Japanese Navy&#x27;s expansion would thus involve a combination of heavily armed large warships, with smaller and more innovative offensive units permitting aggressive tactics.

As a result of the conflict, under the Treaty of Shimonoseki (April 17, 1895), Taiwan and the Pescadores Islands were transferred to Japan. The Imperial Japanese Navy took possession of the island and quelled opposition movements between March and October 1895. Japan also obtained the Liaodong Peninsula, although was later forced by Russia, Germany and France to return it to China (Triple Intervention), only for Russia take possession of it soon after.

==Suppression of the Boxer rebellion (1900)==
The Imperial Japanese Navy further intervened in China in 1900 by participating, together with Western Powers, in the suppression of the Chinese Boxer Rebellion. The Japanese navy supplied the largest number of warships (18 out of a total of 50) and delivered the largest contingent of troops among the intervening nations (20,840 Imperial Japanese Army and Navy soldiers, out of a total of 54,000).

The conflict allowed Japan to engage in combat alongside Western nations and to acquire first-hand understanding of their fighting methods.

==Naval buildup and tensions with Russia==


Following the war against China, Japan was pressured into renouncing its claim to the Liaodong Peninsula in the Russian-led Triple Intervention. The Japanese were well aware that they could not compete with the overwhelming naval power possessed by the three countries in East Asian waters, particularly Russia. Faced with little choice, the Japanese ceded the peninsula back to China for an additional 30 million taels (roughly ¥45 million). The cession of the Liaodong Peninsula was seen as a humiliation by the Japanese political and military leadership, and Japan began to build up its military strength in preparation for future confrontations. The political capital and public support that the navy gained as a result of the recent conflict with China also encouraged popular and legislative support for naval expansion.

In 1895, Yamamoto Gombei was assigned to compose a study of Japan&#x27;s future naval needs. He believed that Japan should have sufficient naval strength to not only deal with a single hypothetical enemy individually, but also to confront any fleet from two combined powers that might be dispatched against Japan from overseas waters. He assumed that given their conflicting global interests, it was highly unlikely that the United Kingdom and Russia would ever join together in a war against Japan, instead considering it more likely that a major power like Russia (in alliance with a lesser naval power) would dispatch a portion of its fleet against Japan. Yamamoto therefore calculated that four battleships would be the most likely strength of any seagoing force that a major power could divert from their other naval commitments to use against Japan, and he also believed that two more battleships might be contributed to such a naval expedition by a lesser hostile power. In order to achieve victory in such an engagement, Yamamoto theorized that Japan should have a force of at least six large battleships, supplemented by four armored cruisers of at least 7,000 tons. The centerpiece of this expansion was to be the acquisition of four new battleships, in addition to two that were already being completed in Britain as part of an earlier construction program. Yamamoto was also advocated the construction of a balanced fleet. 

Under this expansion program, battleships would be supplemented by lesser warships of various types, including cruisers designed to seek out and pursue the enemy, as well as a sufficient number of destroyers and torpedo boats capable of striking the enemy in home ports. As a result, the program also included the construction of twenty-three destroyers, sixty-three torpedo boats, and an expansion of Japanese shipyards and repair and training facilities. In 1897, due to fears that the size of the Russian fleet assigned to East Asian waters could be larger than previously believed, the plan was revised. Although budgetary limitations simply did not permit the construction of another battleship squadron, Japanese planners assessed that the new Harvey and KC armor plates could resist all but the largest AP shells, meaning that armored cruisers could take the place of at least some battleships in the line. With modern armor and lighter but more powerful quick-firing guns, this new cruiser type was theoretically superior to many older battleships still afloat. Subsequently, revisions to the ten-year plan led to the four protected cruisers being replaced by an additional two armored cruisers. As a consequence the Japanese concept of a &quot;Six-Six Fleet&quot; was born, calling for a fleet consisting of six battleships and six armored cruisers.

The program for a 260,000-ton navy, to be completed over a ten-year period in two stages of construction, and with a total cost of ¥280 million, was approved by the cabinet in late 1895 and funded by the Diet in early 1896. Of the total, warship acquisitions accounted for just over ¥200 million. The first stage would begin in 1896 and be completed by 1902, and the second was projected to run from 1897 to 1905. The program was largely financed via indemnities secured from the Chinese after the First Sino-Japanese War. This was used to fund the bulk of the naval expansion, roughly ¥139 million, with public loans and existing government revenue providing the rest of the financing required over the ten years of the program. Japan&#x27;s industrial resources at the time were inadequate to construct a fleet of armored warships wholly domestically, as the country was still in the process of acquiring the industrial infrastructure necessary for the construction of major naval vessels. Consequently, the overwhelming majority of new Japanese warships at this time were built in British shipyards. With the completion of the fleet, Japan would become the fourth strongest naval power in the world in a single decade. In 1902, Japan formed an alliance with Britain, which stipulated that if Japan went to war in the Far East and that a third power entered the fight against Japan, then Britain would come to the aid of the Japanese. This was intended to act as a check to any third power intervening militarily in any future Japanese war with Russia.

==Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905)==


Upon completion, the new fleet consisted of:
* 6 battleships (all British-built)
* 8 armored cruisers (4 British-, 2 Italian-, 1 German-built &quot;Yakumo&quot;, and 1 French-built &quot;Azuma&quot;)
* 9 cruisers (5 Japanese, 2 British and 2 US-built)
* 24 destroyers (16 British- and 8 Japanese-built)
* 63 torpedo boats (26 German-, 10 British-, 17 French-, and 10 Japanese-built)

One of these battleships, , which was among the most powerful warships afloat when completed, was ordered from the Vickers shipyard in the United Kingdom at the end of 1898, for delivery to Japan in 1902. Commercial shipbuilding in Japan was exhibited by construction of the twin screw steamer &quot;Aki-Maru&quot;, built for Nippon Yusen Kaisha by the Mitsubishi Dockyard &amp; Engine Works in Nagasaki. The Imperial Japanese cruiser was built at the Union Iron Works in San Francisco, California.

This fleet first saw action with the onset of the Russo-Japanese War. At the Battle of Tsushima, Admiral Togo (flag in &quot;Mikasa&quot;) led the Japanese Grand Fleet into the decisive engagement of the war. The Russian fleet was almost completely annihilated in a lopsided battle; out of 38 Russian ships, 21 were sunk, seven captured and six disarmed. 4,545 Russian servicemen were killed and 6,106 taken prisoner. Conversely, the Japanese only lost 116 men and three torpedo boats. These victories broke Russian naval strength in East Asia, and triggered waves of mutinies in the Russian Navy at Sevastopol, Vladivostok and Kronstadt, peaking in June with the &quot;Potemkin&quot; uprising, which contributed to the Russian Revolution of 1905. The victory at Tsushima significantly elevated the stature of the Japanese navy at home and abroad.

The Imperial Japanese Navy acquired its first submarines in 1905 from Electric Boat Company, barely four years after the US Navy had commissioned its own first submarine, . The submarines were Holland designs, developed under the supervision of Electric Boat representative Arthur L. Busch. These five submarines (known as Holland Type VII&#x27;s) were shipped in kit form to Japan (October 1904) and then assembled at the Yokosuka, Kanagawa Yokosuka Naval Arsenal, to become hulls &quot;No.1&quot; through &quot;No. 5&quot;, and became operational at the end of 1905.

==Towards an autonomous national navy (1905–1914)==

Japan continued in its efforts to build up a strong domestic naval industry. Following a strategy of &quot;copy, improve, innovate&quot;, foreign ships of various designs were analyzed in depth, their specifications often improved on, and then were purchased in pairs so as to organize comparative testing and improvements. Over the course of years, the import of entire classes of ships was progressively replaced piecemeal by local assembly, and eventually complete domestic production. This process began with smaller vessels, such as torpedo boats and cruisers in the 1880s, and progressed to whole battleships in the early 20th century. The last major Japanese purchase of a foreign-constructed vessel was in 1913, when the battlecruiser was purchased from the Vickers shipyard. By 1918, there was no aspect of shipbuilding technology where Japanese capabilities fell significantly below the standards of other modern navies.

The period immediately following the Battle of Tsushima also saw the IJN, under the influence of the navalist theoretician Satō Tetsutarō, adopt an explicit policy of preparing for a potential future conflict against the U.S. Navy. Satō called for a fleet at least 70% as strong as that of the United States. In 1907, the official policy of the Navy became an &#x27;eight-eight fleet&#x27;, consisting of eight modern battleships and eight battlecruisers. However, financial constraints prevented this idea from ever becoming a reality before the outbreak of the Second World War.

By 1920, the Imperial Japanese Navy was the world&#x27;s third largest, and a leader in naval development and innovation.
* Following its 1897 invention by Marconi, the Japanese Navy was the first navy to employ wireless telegraphy in combat, at the 1905 Battle of Tsushima.
* In 1905, it began building the battleship (at the time the largest warship in the world by displacement), the first ship to be designed, ordered and laid down as an &quot;all-big-gun&quot; battleship, about one year prior to the launching of . However, due to a lack of material, she was completed with a mixed battery of rifles, launched on 15 November 1906, and finally completed on 25 March 1910.
* Between 1903 and 1910, Japan began to build battleships domestically. The battleship &quot;Satsuma&quot; was built in Japan with about 80% material imported from Great Britain, with the following battleship class in 1909, the , built with only 20% imported parts.

==World War I (1914–1918)==

Japan entered World War I on the side of the Entente, against Germany and Austria-Hungary, as a consequence of the 1902 Anglo-Japanese Alliance. At the Siege of Tsingtao, the Imperial Japanese Navy supported the capture of the German colony at Jiaozhou Bay. During the siege, beginning on 5 September 1914, the IJN&#x27;s carried out the world&#x27;s first successful sea-launched air strikes. On 6 September 1914, in the very first air-sea battle in history, a Farman aircraft launched by &quot;Wakamiya&quot; attacked the Austro-Hungarian cruiser and the German gunboat off Qingdao. Four Maurice Farman seaplanes bombarded German land targets, including communication and command centers, and damaged a German minelayer in the Tsingtao peninsula from September to 6 November 1914, when the Germans surrendered.

An IJN battle group was also sent to the central Pacific between August and September to pursue the German East Asia squadron, which then moved into the Southern Atlantic, where it encountered British naval forces and was destroyed near the Falkland Islands. Japan also seized German possessions in northern Micronesia, which remained under Japanese control as colonies until the end of World War II, under the League of Nations&#x27; South Seas Mandate. The United Kingdom, hard-pressed in Europe and enjoying only a narrow margin of superiority against the German High Seas Fleet, asked to be loaned Japan&#x27;s four newly-built &quot;Kongō&quot;-class battlecruisers (&quot;Kongō&quot;, , , and ), some of the first ships in the world to be equipped with guns, and the most formidable battlecruisers in the world at the time. The British request was denied by Japan.

Following a further request for naval assistance by the British, and the initiation of unrestricted submarine warfare by Germany, in March 1917, the Japanese sent a special force to the Mediterranean. This force consisted of one protected cruiser, &quot;Akashi&quot;, as flotilla leader and eight of the Navy&#x27;s newest Kaba-class destroyers (, , , , , , , and ), under Admiral Satō Kōzō. This formation was based in Malta and efficiently protected Entente shipping between Marseille, Taranto, and ports in Egypt until the end of the war. In June, &quot;Akashi&quot; was replaced by , and four more destroyers (&quot;Kashi&quot;, &quot;Hinoki&quot;, &quot;Momo&quot;, and &quot;Yanagi&quot;) were added to the task force. They were later joined by the cruiser . By the end of the war, the Japanese had escorted 788 Entente transports. One destroyer, &quot;Sakaki&quot;, was torpedoed on 11 June 1917 by a German submarine with the loss of 59 officers and men. A memorial at the Kalkara Naval Cemetery in Malta was dedicated to the 72 Japanese sailors who died in action during the Mediterranean convoy patrols.

Japan also began exporting naval hardware during the First World War. In 1917, Japan exported 12 Arabe-class destroyers to France. In 1918, ships such as were assigned to act as convoy escorts in the Indian Ocean between Singapore and the Suez Canal as part of Japan&#x27;s commitments to the U.K. under the Anglo-Japanese alliance. After the conflict, the Japanese Navy received seven German submarines as war reparations. These submarines were brought to Japan and analyzed, contributing greatly to the development of the Japanese submarine industry.

==Interwar years (1918–1937)==

By 1921, Japan&#x27;s naval expenditure had reached nearly 32% of the national budget. 

===Washington treaty system===

In the years following after the end of First World War, the naval construction programs of the world&#x27;s three greatest naval powers - Britain, Japan and the United States - had threatened to set off a new potentially dangerous and expensive naval arms race. Negotiations between the three powers resulted in the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, which became one of history&#x27;s most effective arms reduction programs, setting up a system of ratios between the five signatory powers. The United States and Britain were each allocated 525,000 tons of capital ships, Japan 315,000, and France and Italy 175,000, corresponding to ratios of 5:3:1.75. The treaty&#x27;s signatories also agreed to a ten-year moratorium on battleship construction, though replacement of battleships reaching 20 years of service was permitted. Maximum displacement limits of 35,000 tons per ship, and a prohibition on arming ships with guns larger than 16 inches, were also set. Aircraft carrier construction was also restricted under the same 5:5:3 ratio, with Japan allotted 81,000 tons.

Naval armament proponents in Japan&#x27;s delegation were outraged by these limitations, as they limited Japanese naval tonnage well behind that of its foremost rivals at sea. However, the Japanese ultimately concluded that unfavorable tonnage limitations were preferable to an unrestricted arms race with the industrially dominant United States. The Washington System made Japan a junior partner at sea compared to the U.S. and Britain, but it also curtailed the naval construction programs of China and the Soviet Union, who both sought to challenge Japan in Asia.

The Washington Treaty did not restrict the building of ships other than battleships and carriers, resulting in treaty signatories turning toward the construction of heavy cruisers. Treaty stipulations limited these vessels to 10,000 tons and 8-inch guns. The Japanese were also able to extract some concessions, most notably the battleship , which had been partly funded by donations from schoolchildren and would have otherwise been scrapped under the terms of the treaty.

Furthermore, the treaty also dictated that the United States, Britain, and Japan could not expand their preexisting Western Pacific fortifications. Japan specifically was barred from militarizing the Kurile Islands, the Bonin Islands, Amami-Oshima, the Loochoo Islands, Formosa and the Pescadores.

===Development of naval aviation===
Despite a gradual shift toward domestic production, Japan continued to solicit foreign expertise in areas where the IJN lacked experience, namely naval aviation. The Japanese navy had closely monitored the development and use of combat aviation by the three Allied naval powers during World War I, and concluded that Britain had made the greatest advances in naval aviation. At Japanese request, the British organized the Sempill Mission, led by Captain William Forbes-Sempill (a former officer in the Royal Air Force experienced in the design and testing of Royal Navy aircraft during the First World War), which consisted of 27 members with experience in naval aviation, including pilots and engineers from several British aircraft manufacturing firms. This British technical mission left for Japan in September 1921 with the objective of helping the Imperial Japanese Navy develop and improve the proficiency of its naval air arm. The mission arrived at Kasumigaura Naval Air Station the following month, in November 1921, and stayed in Japan for 18 months.

The mission brought well over a hundred British aircraft comprising twenty different models to Kasumigaura, five of which were then currently in service with the Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm. Japanese pilots were trained on several of these aircraft, such as the Gloster Sparrowhawk, then a frontline fighter. The Japanese would go on to order 50 of these planes from Gloster, and build 40 domestic variants themselves. These planes eventually provided design inspiration for a number of Japanese naval aircraft. Over the course of the Sempill mission&#x27;s stay, Japanese technicians became familiar with the newest aerial weapons and equipment, including torpedoes, bombs, machine guns, cameras, and communications gear. 

The mission also brought the plans of the most recent British aircraft carriers, such as HMS &quot;Argus&quot; and HMS &quot;Hermes&quot;, which influenced the final stages of the development of the Japanese carrier . By the time the mission&#x27;s last members had returned to Britain, the Japanese had acquired a reasonable grasp of the latest aviation technology and taken the first steps toward building an effective naval air force. However, in both technology and doctrine, Japanese naval aviation continued to be dependent on the British model for most of the 1920s.

===Naval developments during the interwar years===

Between the First and Second World Wars, Japan took the lead in many areas of warship development:
* In 1921, it launched , the first purpose-built aircraft carrier in the world to be completed, and subsequently developed a fleet of carriers that would be one of the most powerful in the world by the early 1940s.
* In keeping with its doctrine, the Imperial Japanese Navy was the first to mount guns on and guns on , and constructed the only battleships ever to mount guns (the ).
* In 1928, it launched the innovative , introducing enclosed dual turrets capable of anti-aircraft fire. The new destroyer design was soon emulated by other navies. The &quot;Fubuki&quot; class also featured the first torpedo tubes enclosed in splinter proof turrets.
* Japan developed the oxygen-fueled Type 93 torpedo, generally recognized as the best torpedo of World War Two.

===Doctrinal debates===
The Imperial Japanese Navy was faced before and during World War II with considerable strategic challenges, probably more so than any other navy in the world. Japan, like Britain, was almost entirely dependent on foreign resources to supply its economy. In order to achieve Japan&#x27;s expansionist policies, the IJN therefore had to secure distant sources of raw material (especially Southeast Asian oil and raw materials), controlled by foreign countries (Britain, France, and the Netherlands), and secure their seaborne transport back to the Home Islands. Japanese planners assessed that building large warships capable of long range operations was the best way to achieve these goals. In the years before World War II, the IJN began to structure itself specifically to challenge American naval power in the Pacific. Throughout the 1930s, Japanese politics became increasingly dominated by militaristic leaders who prioritized territorial expansion, and who eventually came to view the United States as Japan&#x27;s main obstacle to achieving this goal. 

Japanese naval planners subscribed to a doctrine of &quot;decisive battle&quot; (, &quot;Kantai Kessen&quot;), which stipulated that Japan&#x27;s path to victory against a peer adversary at sea required the IJN to comprehensively destroy the bulk of an enemy&#x27;s naval strength in a single, large-scale fleet action. &quot;Kantai kessen&quot; evolved from the writings of geopolitical theorist Alfred T. Mahan, which hypothesized that wars would be decided by large, decisive engagements at sea between opposing surface fleets. Derived from the writings of Satō (who was doubtless influenced by Mahan), &quot;Kantai Kessen&quot; was the basis of Japan&#x27;s demand for a 70% ratio (10:10:7) at the Washington Naval Conference, which Japanese naval planners believed would give the IJN superiority in the &quot;decisive battle area&quot;, and the US&#x27; insistence on a 60% ratio, which meant parity between the two navies. In the specific case of a hypothetical war with the United States, this &quot;decisive battle&quot; doctrine required the U.S. Navy to sail in force across the Pacific, during which it would be harassed and degraded by Japanese submarines, and then engaged and destroyed by IJN surface units in a &quot;decisive battle area&quot; somewhere in waters close to Japan. 

Japan&#x27;s numerical and industrial inferiority to rivals such as the United States led the Japanese leadership to pursue technical superiority (fewer, but faster, more powerful ships), qualitative superiority (better training), and aggressive tactics (daring and speedy attacks overwhelming the enemy, a recipe for success in previous conflicts). However, these calculations failed to account for the type of war Japan would be fighting against an enemy like the U.S. Japan&#x27;s opponents in any future Pacific War would not face the political and geographical constraints that adversaries in previous wars did, and Japanese strategic planning did not properly account for serious potential losses in ships and crews.

During the interwar years, two schools of thought emerged over whether the IJN should be organized around powerful battleships, ultimately able to defeat equivalent American ships in Japanese waters, or whether the IJN should prioritize naval airpower and structure its planning around aircraft carriers. Neither doctrine prevailed, resulting in a balanced yet indecisive approach to capital ship development. 

A consistent weakness of Japanese warship development was the tendency to incorporate excessive firepower and engine output relative to ship size, which was a side-effect of the Washington Treaty limitations on overall tonnage. This led to shortcomings in stability, protection, and structural strength.

===Circle Plans===

In response to the London Treaty of 1930, the Japanese initiated a series of naval construction programs or &quot;hoju keikaku&quot; (&quot;naval replenishment, or construction, plans&quot;), known unofficially as the &quot;maru keikaku&quot; (&quot;circle plans&quot;). Between 1930 and the outbreak of the Second World War, four of these &quot;Circle plans&quot; which were drawn up: in 1931, 1934, 1937 and 1939. The &quot;Circle One&quot; was plan approved in 1931, provided for the construction of 39 ships to be laid down between 1931 and 1934, centering on four of the new s, and the expansion of the Naval Air Service to fourteen air groups. However, plans for a second &quot;Circle&quot; plan were delayed by the capsizing of the Tomozuru and heavy typhoon damage to the Fourth Fleet, which revealed that the fundamental design philosophy of many Japanese warships was flawed. These flaws included poor construction techniques and structural instability caused by mounting too much weaponry on too small of a displacement hull. As a result, most of the naval budget in 1932–1933 was absorbed by modifications that attempted to rectify these issues with existing equipment.

In 1934, the &quot;Circle Two&quot; plan was approved, covering the construction of 48 new warships, including the s and two aircraft carriers, the and . The plan also continued the buildup in naval aircraft and authorized the creation of eight new Naval Air Groups. With Japan&#x27;s renunciation of previously signed naval treaties in December 1934, the &quot;Circle Three&quot; plan was approved in 1937, marking Japan&#x27;s third major naval building program since 1930. &quot;Circle Three&quot; called for the construction of new warships that were free from the restrictions of previous naval treaties over a period of six years. New ships would concentrate on qualitative superiority in order to compensate for Japan&#x27;s quantitative deficiencies compared to the United States. While the primary focus of &quot;Circle Three&quot; was to be the construction of two super-battleships, and , it also called for building the two s, along with sixty-four other warships of other categories. &quot;Circle Three&quot; also called for the rearming of the decommissioned battlecruiser &quot;Hiei&quot; and the refitting of her sister ships &quot;Kongō&quot;, &quot;Haruna&quot;, and &quot;Kirishima&quot;. Also funded was the upgrading of four &quot;Mogami&quot;-class cruisers and two &quot;Tone&quot; class cruisers, which were under construction, by replacing their 6-inch main batteries with 8-inch guns. In aviation, &quot;Circle Three&quot; aimed at maintaining parity with American naval air power by constructing an additional 827 planes, to be allocated between fourteen planned land-based air groups, and increasing carrier aircraft by nearly 1,000. To accommodate the new land aircraft, the plan called for several new airfields to be built or expanded; it also provided for a significant increase in the size of the navy&#x27;s production facilities for aircraft and aerial weapons.

In 1938, with &quot;Circle Three&quot; under way, the Japanese began to consider preparations for a fourth naval expansion project, which was scheduled for 1940. With the American Naval Act of 1938, the Japanese accelerated the &quot;Circle Four&quot; six-year expansion program, which was approved in September 1939. &quot;Circle Four&#x27;s&quot; goal was doubling Japan&#x27;s naval air strength in just five years, delivering air superiority in East Asia and the western Pacific. It called for the building of two s, a fleet carrier, six of a new class of planned escort carriers, six cruisers, twenty-two destroyers, and twenty-five submarines.

===Second Sino-Japanese War===
Experience gained during the first part of the Second Sino-Japanese War was of great value to the development of Japanese naval aviation, demonstrating how aircraft could contribute to the projection of naval power ashore.

The IJN had two primary responsibilities during the campaign: to support amphibious operations on the Chinese coast, and to conduct strategic aerial bombardment of Chinese cities. This was the first time any naval air arm had been given such tasks.

From the onset of hostilities in 1937, until Japanese naval forces were diverted to combat in other parts of the Pacific in 1941, naval aircraft played a key role in military operations on the Chinese mainland. These began with air attacks on Chinese military installations, largely in the Yangtze River basin along the Chinese coast, by Japanese carrier aircraft. Naval involvement during the conflict peaked in 1938–39 with the heavy bombardment of Chinese cities deep in the interior by land-based medium bombers, and concluded during 1941 with a large-scale attempt by both carrier-borne and land-based tactical aircraft to interdict communication and transportation routes in southern China. Although the 1937–41 air offensives failed in their political and psychological aims, they did reduce the flow of strategic materiel to China, and for a time improved the Japan&#x27;s military situation in the central and southern parts of the country.

==World War II==

To effectively combat the numerically superior U.S. Navy, the Japanese had devoted a large amount of resources to create a force of superior quality. Crucially, relying heavily on the use of aggressive tactics which stemmed from Mahanian doctrine and the concept of decisive battle, Japan did not invest significantly in capabilities needed to protect its long shipping lines against enemy submarines. In particular, Japan under-invested in the vital area of antisubmarine warfare (both escort ships and escort carriers), and in the specialized training and organization to support it. Japan&#x27;s reluctance to use its submarine fleet for commerce raiding and failure to comprehensively secure its seaborne communications would ultimately contribute to its defeat in the Pacific war. The Japanese Navy also under-invested in intelligence and had hardly any agents active in the United States when the war started. After the war, several Japanese naval officers credited a lack of information about the U.S. Navy as another major factor in their defeat.

On 7 December 1941, the IJN launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, killing 2,403 Americans and crippling the U.S. Pacific Fleet. During the first six months of the Pacific War, the IJN enjoyed spectacular success, inflicting crushing defeats on Allied forces across a vast swathe of the Pacific Ocean. Allied naval strength in Southeast Asia was largely crippled during the initial Japanese conquest. Japanese naval aircraft were responsible for the sinking of HMS &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and HMS &quot;Repulse&quot;, which was the first time that capital ships were sunk by aerial attack while underway. In April 1942, the Indian Ocean raid largely drove the Royal Navy out of Southeast Asian waters.

After these successes, the IJN concentrated on the elimination or neutralization of strategic points from which the Allies could launch counteroffensives against territory newly occupied by Japan. However, at the Battle of Coral Sea the Japanese were forced to abandon their attempts to isolate Australia, while defeat in the Midway Campaign cost the Japanese four fleet carriers and most of their accompanying aircrew. The campaign in the Solomon Islands from August 1942 to February 1943, in which the Japanese ultimately lost a costly, monthslong battle of attrition with Allied forces over the island of Guadalcanal, compounded previous defeats and highlighted the accelerating degradation of the IJN&#x27;s capabilities. During 1943, American industrial strength began to turn the tide of the war at sea. American forces ultimately managed to gain the upper hand through a vastly greater industrial output, a modernization of their air and naval forces and the inability of Japan to replace lost air and naval power.

In 1943, the Japanese also turned their attention to the defensive perimeters of their previous conquests. Forces on Japanese held islands in Micronesia were to absorb and wear down an expected American counteroffensive. However, American industrial power become apparent and the military forces that faced the Japanese in 1943 were overwhelming in firepower and equipment. From the end of 1943 to 1944 Japan&#x27;s defensive perimeter failed to hold.

The catastrophic defeat at the Philippine Sea in June 1944 was a disaster for Japanese naval air power, with the bulk of the IJN&#x27;s highly-trained and, at this point in the war, largely irreplaceable carrier pilots shot down. The engagement was a setback from which the IJN&#x27;s carrier air arm would never recover; American pilots terming the lopsided naval air battle the &quot;Great Marianas Turkey Shoot&quot;. Four months later, in October 1944, Japanese attempts to interdict American amphibious landings on the Philippine islands at Leyte Gulf, utilizing surface vessels without sufficient air cover, resulted the destruction of a large part of the Japanese surface fleet. During the last phase of the war, the Imperial Japanese Navy resorted to a series of desperate measures, including a utilization of Special Attack Units, popularly called &quot;kamikazes&quot;. By May 1945, much of the Imperial Japanese Navy had been sunk, and surviving IJN warships had taken refuge in harbors on the Home Islands, due to both a lack of fuel and an inability to contend with overwhelming American naval airpower. In late July 1945, most of the remaining large warships of the Imperial Japanese Navy were sunk at anchor in air attacks on Kure and the Inland Sea. By August 1945, &quot;Nagato&quot; was the only surviving capital ship of the Imperial Japanese Navy.

Naval Infantry units from 12th Air Fleet saw extensive action during South Sakhalin and Kuil Islands campaign in Soviet–Japanese War.

==Legacy==

===Self-Defense Forces===
Following Japan&#x27;s surrender and subsequent occupation by the Allies at the conclusion of World War II, the Imperial Japanese Navy, along with the rest of the Japanese military, was dissolved in 1945. In the new constitution of Japan, drawn up in 1947, Article 9 specifies that &quot;the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes.&quot; The prevalent view in Japan is that this article allows for military forces to be kept for purposes of self-defense. 

In 1952, the Safety Security Force was formed within the Maritime Safety Agency, incorporating the minesweeping fleet and other military vessels, mainly destroyers, given by the United States. In 1954, the Safety Security Force was separated, and the JMSDF was formally created as the naval branch of the Japanese Self-Defense Force (JSDF), following the passage of the 1954 Self-Defense Forces Law. Japan&#x27;s current navy falls under the umbrella of the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) as the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF).

<text>A longest common subsequence (LCS) is the longest subsequence common to all sequences in a set of sequences (often just two sequences). It differs from the longest common substring: unlike substrings, subsequences are not required to occupy consecutive positions within the original sequences. The problem of computing longest common subsequences is a classic computer science problem, the basis of data comparison programs such as the codice_1 utility, and has applications in computational linguistics and bioinformatics. It is also widely used by revision control systems such as Git for reconciling multiple changes made to a revision-controlled collection of files. 
For example, consider the sequences (ABCD) and (ACBAD). They have five length-2 common subsequences: (AB), (AC), (AD), (BD), and (CD); two length-3 common subsequences: (ABD) and (ACD); and no longer common subsequences. So (ABD) and (ACD) are their longest common subsequences.

== Complexity ==
For the general case of an arbitrary number of input sequences, the problem is NP-hard. When the number of sequences is constant, the problem is solvable in polynomial time by dynamic programming.

Given formula_1 sequences of lengths formula_2, a naive search would test each of the formula_3 subsequences of the first sequence to determine whether they are also subsequences of the remaining sequences; each subsequence may be tested in time linear in the lengths of the remaining sequences, so the time for this algorithm would be
:formula_4

For the case of two sequences of &quot;n&quot; and &quot;m&quot; elements, the running time of the dynamic programming approach is O(&quot;n&quot; × &quot;m&quot;). For an arbitrary number of input sequences, the dynamic programming approach gives a solution in

:formula_5

There exist methods with lower complexity,
which often depend on the length of the LCS, the size of the alphabet, or both.

The LCS is not necessarily unique; in the worst case, the number of common subsequences is exponential in the lengths of the inputs, so the algorithmic complexity must be at least exponential.

== Solution for two sequences ==
The LCS problem has an optimal substructure: the problem can be broken down into smaller, simpler subproblems, which can, in turn, be broken down into simpler subproblems, and so on, until, finally, the solution becomes trivial. LCS in particular has overlapping subproblems: the solutions to high-level subproblems often reuse solutions to lower level subproblems. Problems with these two properties are amenable to dynamic programming approaches, in which subproblem solutions are memoized, that is, the solutions of subproblems are saved for reuse.

=== Prefixes ===
The prefix &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot; of &quot;S&quot; is defined as the first &quot;n&quot; characters of &quot;S&quot;. For example, the prefixes of &quot;S&quot; = (AGCA) are
:&quot;S&quot;0 = ()
:&quot;S&quot;1 = (A)
:&quot;S&quot;2 = (AG)
:&quot;S&quot;3 = (AGC)
:&quot;S&quot;4 = (AGCA).

Let &quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;) be a function that computes a longest subsequence common to &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;. Such a function has two interesting properties.

=== First property ===
&quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;X&quot;^&quot;A&quot;,&quot;Y&quot;^&quot;A&quot;) = &quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;X&quot;,&quot;Y&quot;)^&quot;A&quot;, for all strings &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot; and all symbols &quot;A&quot;, where ^ denotes string concatenation. This allows one to simplify the &quot;LCS&quot; computation for two sequences ending in the same symbol.
For example, &quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;BANANA&quot;,&quot;ATANA&quot;) = &quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;BANAN&quot;,&quot;ATAN&quot;)^&quot;A&quot;, Continuing for the remaining common symbols, &quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;BANANA&quot;,&quot;ATANA&quot;) = &quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;BAN&quot;,&quot;AT&quot;)^&quot;ANA&quot;.

=== Second property ===
If &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are distinct symbols (&quot;A&quot;≠&quot;B&quot;), then &quot;LCS&quot;(X^A,Y^B) is one of the maximal-length strings in the set { &quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;X&quot;^&quot;A&quot;,&quot;Y&quot;), &quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;X&quot;,&quot;Y&quot;^&quot;B&quot;) }, for all strings &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;.

For example, 
&quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;ABCDEFG&quot;,&quot;BCDGK&quot;) is the longest string among &quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;ABCDEFG&quot;,&quot;BCDG&quot;) and &quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;ABCDEF&quot;,&quot;BCDGK&quot;); if both happened to be of equal length, one of them could be chosen arbitrarily.

To realize the property, distinguish two cases:
*If &quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;ABCDEFG&quot;,&quot;BCDGK&quot;) ends with a &quot;G&quot;, then the final &quot;K&quot; cannot be in the LCS, hence &quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;ABCDEFG&quot;,&quot;BCDGK&quot;) = &quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;ABCDEFG&quot;,&quot;BCDG&quot;).
*If &quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;ABCDEFG&quot;,&quot;BCDGK&quot;) does not end with a &quot;G&quot;, then the final &quot;G&quot; cannot be in the LCS, hence &quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;ABCDEFG&quot;,&quot;BCDGK&quot;) = &quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;ABCDEF&quot;,&quot;BCDGK&quot;).

=== &quot;LCS&quot; function defined ===
Let two sequences be defined as follows: formula_6 and formula_7. The prefixes of formula_8 are formula_9; the prefixes of formula_10 are formula_11. Let formula_12 represent the set of longest common subsequence of prefixes formula_13 and formula_14. This set of sequences is given by the following.

:formula_15

To find the LCS of formula_13 and formula_14, compare formula_18 and formula_19. If they are equal, then the sequence formula_20 is extended by that element, formula_18. If they are not equal, then the longest among the two sequences, formula_22, and formula_23, is retained. (If they are the same length, but not identical, then both are retained.) The base case, when either formula_13 or formula_25 is empty, is the empty string, formula_26.

=== Worked example ===
The longest subsequence common to &quot;R&quot; = (GAC), and &quot;C&quot; = (AGCAT) will be found. Because the &quot;LCS&quot; function uses a &quot;zeroth&quot; element, it is convenient to define zero prefixes that are empty for these sequences: &quot;R&quot;0 = ε; and &quot;C&quot;0 = ε. All the prefixes are placed in a table with &quot;C&quot; in the first row (making it a column header) and &quot;R&quot; in the first column (making it a row header).

This table is used to store the LCS sequence for each step of the calculation. The second column and second row have been filled in with ε, because when an empty sequence is compared with a non-empty sequence, the longest common subsequence is always an empty sequence.

&quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;R&quot;1, &quot;C&quot;1) is determined by comparing the first elements in each sequence. G and A are not the same, so this LCS gets (using the &quot;second property&quot;) the longest of the two sequences, &quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;R&quot;1, &quot;C&quot;0) and &quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;R&quot;0, &quot;C&quot;1). According to the table, both of these are empty, so &quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;R&quot;1, &quot;C&quot;1) is also empty, as shown in the table below. The arrows indicate that the sequence comes from both the cell above, &quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;R&quot;0, &quot;C&quot;1) and the cell on the left, &quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;R&quot;1, &quot;C&quot;0).

&quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;R&quot;1, &quot;C&quot;2) is determined by comparing G and G. They match, so G is appended to the upper left sequence, &quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;R&quot;0, &quot;C&quot;1), which is (ε), giving (εG), which is (G).

For &quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;R&quot;1, &quot;C&quot;3), G and C do not match. The sequence above is empty; the one to the left contains one element, G. Selecting the longest of these, &quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;R&quot;1, &quot;C&quot;3) is (G). The arrow points to the left, since that is the longest of the two sequences.

&quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;R&quot;1, &quot;C&quot;4), likewise, is (G).

&quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;R&quot;1, &quot;C&quot;5), likewise, is (G).

For &quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;R&quot;2, &quot;C&quot;1), A is compared with A. The two elements match, so A is appended to ε, giving (A).

For &quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;R&quot;2, &quot;C&quot;2), A and G do not match, so the longest of &quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;R&quot;1, &quot;C&quot;2), which is (G), and &quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;R&quot;2, &quot;C&quot;1), which is (A), is used. In this case, they each contain one element, so this LCS is given two subsequences: (A) and (G).

For &quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;R&quot;2, &quot;C&quot;3), A does not match C. &quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;R&quot;2, &quot;C&quot;2) contains sequences (A) and (G); LCS(&quot;R&quot;1, &quot;C&quot;3) is (G), which is already contained in &quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;R&quot;2, &quot;C&quot;2). The result is that &quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;R&quot;2, &quot;C&quot;3) also contains the two subsequences, (A) and (G).

For &quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;R&quot;2, &quot;C&quot;4), A matches A, which is appended to the upper left cell, giving (GA).

For &quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;R&quot;2, &quot;C&quot;5), A does not match T. Comparing the two sequences, (GA) and (G), the longest is (GA), so &quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;R&quot;2, &quot;C&quot;5) is (GA).

For &quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;R&quot;3, &quot;C&quot;1), C and A do not match, so &quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;R&quot;3, &quot;C&quot;1) gets the longest of the two sequences, (A).

For &quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;R&quot;3, &quot;C&quot;2), C and G do not match. Both &quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;R&quot;3, &quot;C&quot;1) and &quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;R&quot;2, &quot;C&quot;2) have one element. The result is that &quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;R&quot;3, &quot;C&quot;2) contains the two subsequences, (A) and (G).

For &quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;R&quot;3, &quot;C&quot;3), C and C match, so C is appended to &quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;R&quot;2, &quot;C&quot;2), which contains the two subsequences, (A) and (G), giving (AC) and (GC).

For &quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;R&quot;3, &quot;C&quot;4), C and A do not match. Combining &quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;R&quot;3, &quot;C&quot;3), which contains (AC) and (GC), and &quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;R&quot;2, &quot;C&quot;4), which contains (GA), gives a total of three sequences: (AC), (GC), and (GA).

Finally, for &quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;R&quot;3, &quot;C&quot;5), C and T do not match. The result is that &quot;LCS&quot;(&quot;R&quot;3, &quot;C&quot;5) also contains the three sequences, (AC), (GC), and (GA).

The final result is that the last cell contains all the longest subsequences common to (AGCAT) and (GAC); these are (AC), (GC), and (GA). The table also shows the longest common subsequences for every possible pair of prefixes. For example, for (AGC) and (GA), the longest common subsequence are (A) and (G).

=== Traceback approach ===
Calculating the LCS of a row of the LCS table requires only the solutions to the current row and the previous row. Still, for long sequences, these sequences can get numerous and long, requiring a lot of storage space. Storage space can be saved by saving not the actual subsequences, but the length of the subsequence and the direction of the arrows, as in the table below.

The actual subsequences are deduced in a &quot;traceback&quot; procedure that follows the arrows backwards, starting from the last cell in the table. When the length decreases, the sequences must have had a common element. Several paths are possible when two arrows are shown in a cell. Below is the table for such an analysis, with numbers colored in cells where the length is about to decrease. The bold numbers trace out the sequence, (GA).

== Relation to other problems ==
For two strings formula_27 and formula_28, the length of the shortest common supersequence is related to the length of the LCS by

:formula_29

The edit distance when only insertion and deletion is allowed (no substitution), or when the cost of the substitution is the double of the cost of an insertion or deletion, is:

:formula_30

== Code for the dynamic programming solution ==
=== Computing the length of the LCS ===
The function below takes as input sequences codice_2 and codice_3, computes the LCS between codice_4 and codice_5 for all codice_6 and codice_7, and stores it in codice_8. codice_9 will contain the length of the LCS of codice_10 and codice_11.

 function LCSLength(X[1..m], Y[1..n])
 C = array(0..m, 0..n)
 for i := 0..m
 C[i,0] = 0
 for j := 0..n
 C[0,j] = 0
 for i := 1..m
 for j := 1..n
 if X[i] = Y[j]
 C[i,j] := C[i-1,j-1] + 1
 else
 C[i,j] := max(C[i,j-1], C[i-1,j])
 return C[m,n]

Alternatively, memoization could be used.

=== Reading out a LCS ===
The following function backtracks the choices taken when computing the codice_12 table. If the last characters in the prefixes are equal, they must be in an LCS. If not, check what gave the largest LCS of keeping formula_18 and formula_19, and make the same choice. Just choose one if they were equally long. Call the function with codice_13 and codice_14.

 function backtrack(C[0..m,0..n], X[1..m], Y[1..n], i, j)
 if i = 0 or j = 0
 return &quot;
 if X[i] = Y[j]
 return backtrack(C, X, Y, i-1, j-1) + X[i]
 if C[i,j-1] &gt; C[i-1,j]
 return backtrack(C, X, Y, i, j-1)
 return backtrack(C, X, Y, i-1, j)

=== Reading out all LCSs ===
If choosing formula_18 and formula_19 would give an equally long result, read out both resulting subsequences. This is returned as a set by this function. Notice that this function is not polynomial, as it might branch in almost every step if the strings are similar.

 function backtrackAll(C[0..m,0..n], X[1..m], Y[1..n], i, j)
 if i = 0 or j = 0
 return {&quot;}
 if X[i] = Y[j]
 return {Z + X[i] for all Z in backtrackAll(C, X, Y, i-1, j-1)}
 R := {}
 if C[i,j-1] ≥ C[i-1,j]
 R := backtrackAll(C, X, Y, i, j-1)
 if C[i-1,j] ≥ C[i,j-1]
 R := R ∪ backtrackAll(C, X, Y, i-1, j)
 return R

=== Print the diff ===
This function will backtrack through the C matrix, and print the diff between the two sequences. Notice that you will get a different answer if you exchange codice_15 and codice_16, with codice_17 and codice_18 below.

 function printDiff(C[0..m,0..n], X[1..m], Y[1..n], i, j)
 if i &gt;= 0 and j &gt;= 0 and X[i] = Y[j]
 printDiff(C, X, Y, i-1, j-1)
 print &quot; &quot; + X[i]
 else if j &gt; 0 and (i = 0 or C[i,j-1] ≥ C[i-1,j])
 printDiff(C, X, Y, i, j-1)
 print &quot;+ &quot; + Y[j]
 else if i &gt; 0 and (j = 0 or C[i,j-1] &lt; C[i-1,j])
 printDiff(C, X, Y, i-1, j)
 print &quot;- &quot; + X[i]
 else
 print &quot;&quot;

=== Example ===
Let formula_8 be “codice_19” and formula_10 be “codice_20”. The longest common subsequence between formula_8 and formula_10 is “codice_21”. The table codice_12 shown below, which is generated by the function codice_23, shows the lengths of the longest common subsequences between prefixes of formula_8 and formula_10. The formula_41th row and formula_42th column shows the length of the LCS between formula_43 and formula_44.

The highlighted numbers show the path the function codice_24 would follow from the bottom right to the top left corner, when reading out an LCS. If the current symbols in formula_8 and formula_10 are equal, they are part of the LCS, and we go both up and left (shown in bold). If not, we go up or left, depending on which cell has a higher number. This corresponds to either taking the LCS between formula_47 and formula_44, or formula_43 and formula_50.

== Code optimization ==
Several optimizations can be made to the algorithm above to speed it up for real-world cases.

=== Reduce the problem set ===
The C matrix in the naive algorithm grows quadratically with the lengths of the sequences. For two 100-item sequences, a 10,000-item matrix would be needed, and 10,000 comparisons would need to be done. In most real-world cases, especially source code diffs and patches, the beginnings and ends of files rarely change, and almost certainly not both at the same time. If only a few items have changed in the middle of the sequence, the beginning and end can be eliminated. This reduces not only the memory requirements for the matrix, but also the number of comparisons that must be done.

 function LCS(X[1..m], Y[1..n])
 start := 1
 m_end := m
 n_end := n
 &quot;trim off the matching items at the beginning&quot;
 while start ≤ m_end and start ≤ n_end and X[start] = Y[start]
 start := start + 1
 &quot;trim off the matching items at the end&quot;
 while start ≤ m_end and start ≤ n_end and X[m_end] = Y[n_end]
 m_end := m_end - 1
 n_end := n_end - 1
 C = array(start-1..m_end, start-1..n_end)
 &quot;only loop over the items that have changed&quot;
 for i := start..m_end
 for j := start..n_end
 &quot;the algorithm continues as before ...&quot;

In the best-case scenario, a sequence with no changes, this optimization would eliminate the need for the C matrix. In the worst-case scenario, a change to the very first and last items in the sequence, only two additional comparisons are performed.

=== Reduce the comparison time ===
Most of the time taken by the naive algorithm is spent performing comparisons between items in the sequences. For textual sequences such as source code, you want to view lines as the sequence elements instead of single characters. This can mean comparisons of relatively long strings for each step in the algorithm. Two optimizations can be made that can help to reduce the time these comparisons consume.

=== Reduce strings to hashes ===
A hash function or checksum can be used to reduce the size of the strings in the sequences. That is, for source code where the average line is 60 or more characters long, the hash or checksum for that line might be only 8 to 40 characters long. Additionally, the randomized nature of hashes and checksums would guarantee that comparisons would short-circuit faster, as lines of source code will rarely be changed at the beginning.

There are three primary drawbacks to this optimization. First, an amount of time needs to be spent beforehand to precompute the hashes for the two sequences. Second, additional memory needs to be allocated for the new hashed sequences. However, in comparison to the naive algorithm used here, both of these drawbacks are relatively minimal.

The third drawback is that of collisions. Since the checksum or hash is not guaranteed to be unique, there is a small chance that two different items could be reduced to the same hash. This is unlikely in source code, but it is possible. A cryptographic hash would therefore be far better suited for this optimization, as its entropy is going to be significantly greater than that of a simple checksum. However, the benefits may not be worth the setup and computational requirements of a cryptographic hash for small sequence lengths.

=== Reduce the required space ===
If only the length of the LCS is required, the matrix can be reduced to a formula_51 matrix, or to a formula_52 vector as the dynamic programming approach requires only the current and previous columns of the matrix. Hirschberg&#x27;s algorithm allows the construction of the optimal sequence itself in the same quadratic time and linear space bounds.

=== Reduce cache misses ===
Chowdhury and Ramachandran devised a quadratic-time linear-space algorithm for finding the LCS length along with an optimal sequence which runs faster than Hirschberg&#x27;s algorithm in practice due to its superior cache performance. The algorithm has an asymptotically optimal cache complexity under the Ideal cache model. Interestingly, the algorithm itself is cache-oblivious meaning that it does not make any choices based on the cache parameters (e.g., cache size and cache line size) of the machine.

=== Further optimized algorithms ===
Several algorithms exist that run faster than the presented dynamic programming approach. One of them is Hunt–Szymanski algorithm, which typically runs in formula_53 time (for formula_54), where formula_55 is the number of matches between the two sequences. For problems with a bounded alphabet size, the Method of Four Russians can be used to reduce the running time of the dynamic programming algorithm by a logarithmic factor.

== Behavior on random strings ==

Beginning with , a number of researchers have investigated the behavior of the longest common subsequence length when the two given strings are drawn randomly from the same alphabet. When the alphabet size is constant, the expected length of the LCS is proportional to the length of the two strings, and the constants of proportionality (depending on alphabet size) are known as the Chvátal–Sankoff constants. Their exact values are not known, but upper and lower bounds on their values have been proven, and it is known that they grow inversely proportionally to the square root of the alphabet size. Simplified mathematical models of the longest common subsequence problem have been shown to be controlled by the Tracy–Widom distribution.

<doc id="236106" wikidata="Q943982" url="?curid=236106" title="Rites of Spring">
<text>Rites of Spring was an American punk rock band from Washington, D.C., formed in late 1983. Along with Embrace and Beefeater, they were one of the mainstay acts of the 1985 Revolution Summer movement which took place within the Washington, D.C. hardcore punk scene.

Musically, the band pushed the violence and passion of hardcore punk while experimenting with composition. The personal nature of their lyrics put them at the forefront of the emerging emo genre, though the band rejected the label.
The band only performed 19 shows, 16 in the DC area and 3 outside of DC. Vocalist/guitarist Guy Picciotto and drummer Brendan Canty went on to play in Fugazi with producer and former Minor Threat singer Ian MacKaye in the late 1980s, while bassist Mike Fellows formed Miighty Flashlight and has had a solo career.

== History ==
Picciotto, Canty, and Fellows had previously played together in the short-lived hardcore band Insurrection. The trio was joined by guitarist Eddie Janney—formerly of the Faith, Skewbald, and the Untouchables—and began writing music together in December 1983. The band finished several songs during this early period, like &quot;All There Is&quot;, &quot;End on End&quot;, and &quot;By Design&quot;. The group made a demo recording at Inner Ear Studios in April 1984, but Fellows moved to California. &quot;We thought he was leaving forever&quot;, Picciotto recalled. &quot;And then we just kept practicing without him, hoping he&#x27;d come back. Lo and behold, three months later, he returned.&quot;

&quot;AllMusic&quot;&#x27;s Matt Kantor described the band&#x27;s music as being at times &quot;fast and furious&quot;, while also being &quot;at other times lush and evocative though always with a sense of drive and melody&quot;. Though rooted in the loud-and-fast style of hardcore punk, Rites of Spring is to be among the first bands who played music in the emotional hardcore genre, or what is now commonly and retrospectively called emo-core, a precursor of screamo. Jenny Toomey notes that, &quot;Rites of Spring existed well before the term did and they hated it.&quot;

They were influenced by The Faith (Eddie Janney&#x27;s previous band) and their 1983 EP &quot;Subject to Change&quot; with their introspective lyrics and angry, melody-tinged songwriting.

The band is named after the symphonic ballet &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; by Igor Stravinsky. &quot;We were reading about Stravinsky and the first [performance] where everybody beat each other on the head&quot;, Picciotto explained. &quot;Whenever you fuck with someone musically and they take their music really serious, they&#x27;re gonna fuck with you back.&quot; Picciotto also said the band chose the name to reflect their desire to revive the D.C. punk scene. &quot;We were trying to create a rebirth of what&#x27;s going on here&quot;, he said. &quot;It seemed to be stagnating for a long time and we just thought the name kind of fit the way we felt, a springtime type thing.&quot;

=== Recordings ===
&quot;Rites of Spring&quot; was the band’s first album. Its twelve songs were recorded at Inner Ear Studios in February 1985, produced by Ian MacKaye of Fugazi and Minor Threat and Michael Hampton of The Faith and SOA. It was released on vinyl in June of that year as Dischord Records No. 16. The album was re-released on CD and cassette in 1987, with an additional track from the same session, &quot;Other Way Around&quot;, as well as the four songs from the Rites&#x27; follow-up EP, &quot;All Through a Life&quot;, Dischord No. 22. The CD and cassette originally retained the number &quot;16&quot;, while the 1991 repress, as well as the 2001 remastered version of the same seventeen songs, were numbered &quot;16CD&quot; and given the new title &quot;End on End&quot;. Their first demo of six songs was recorded in April 1984, almost a year before the sessions that became their debut album. It was released as a CD EP and 10&quot; vinyl record in 2012 on Dischord Records with the catalog number 176. The band broke up in January 1986 soon after the sessions that produced the &quot;All Through A Life&quot; recording.

=== Post-breakup and musical influence ===
Picciotto, Janney and Canty formed One Last Wish with Embrace alumnus, guitarist Michael Hampton. They recorded one studio album, entitled &quot;1986&quot;, which was released in 1999 due to the band breaking up after mixing was finished.

The Rites of Spring personnel reunited for a quasi-reincarnation called Happy Go Licky, releasing an LP/CD of various live concert recordings though never producing any studio work. The music was much more experimental than Rites of Spring, heavily improvised and featuring tape loop effects.

Picciotto and Canty eventually teamed up with bassist Joe Lally and former Minor Threat, Skewbald/Grand Union, Egg Hunt, and Embrace singer Ian MacKaye (co-owner of the band’s label, Dischord Records) in Fugazi. Mike Fellows went on to do session work for the Drag City label and form Miighty Flashlight, releasing an eponymous album under this name in 2002.

Dischord released the band&#x27;s only demo, entitled &quot;Six Song Demo&quot;, in October 2012. All tracks on the demo were previously recorded versions of songs appearing on the &quot;Rites of Spring&quot; album.

== Musical style and legacy ==
Although Rites of Spring are regarded as having &quot;unknowingly created and defined&quot; the emo subgenre of hardcore punk, Picciotto himself has publicly rejected this notion. When asked about it in an interview his response was, &quot;I&#x27;ve never recognized &#x27;emo&#x27; as a genre of music. I always thought it was the most retarded term ever. I know there is this generic commonplace that every band that gets labeled with that term hates it. They feel scandalized by it. But honestly, I just thought that all the bands I played in were punk rock bands. The reason I think it&#x27;s so stupid is that – what, like the Bad Brains weren&#x27;t emotional? What – they were robots or something? It just doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me.&quot;

<doc id="236109" wikidata="Q584430" url="?curid=236109" title="William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk">
<text>William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk (16 October 1396 – 2 May 1450), nicknamed Jackanapes, was an English magnate, statesman and military commander during the Hundred Years&#x27; War. He became a favourite of Henry VI of England, and consequently a leading figure in the English government where he became associated with many of the royal government&#x27;s failures of the time, particularly on the war in France. Suffolk also appears prominently in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry VI&quot;, parts 1 and 2.

He fought in the Hundred Years&#x27; War and participated in campaigns of Henry V, and then continued to serve in France for King Henry VI. He was one of the English commanders at the failed Siege of Orléans. He favoured a diplomatic rather than military solution to the deteriorating situation in France, a stance which would later resonate well with King Henry VI.

Suffolk became a dominant figure in the government, and was at the forefront of the main policies conducted during the period. He played a central role in organizing the Treaty of Tours (1444), and arranged the king&#x27;s marriage to Margaret of Anjou. At the end of Suffolk&#x27;s political career, he was accused of maladministration by many and forced into exile. At sea on his way out, he was caught by an angry mob, subjected to a mock trial, and beheaded.

His estates were forfeited to the Crown but later restored to his only son, John. His political successor was the Duke of Somerset.

==Biography==

William de la Pole was born in Cotton, Suffolk, the second son of Michael de la Pole, 2nd Earl of Suffolk, by his wife Katherine de Stafford, daughter of Hugh de Stafford, 2nd Earl of Stafford, KG, and Philippa de Beauchamp.

Almost continually engaged in the wars in France, he was seriously wounded during the Siege of Harfleur (1415), where his father died from dysentery. Later that year his elder brother Michael, 3rd Earl of Suffolk, was killed at the Battle of Agincourt, and William succeeded as 4th earl. He served in all the later French campaigns of the reign of Henry V, and in spite of his youth held high command on the marches of Normandy in 1421–22.

In 1423 he joined Thomas, Earl of Salisbury, in Champagne. He fought under John, Duke of Bedford, at the Battle of Verneuil on 17 August 1424, and throughout the next four years was Salisbury&#x27;s chief lieutenant in the direction of the war. He became co-commander of the English forces at the Siege of Orléans (1429), after the death of Salisbury.

When the city was relieved by Joan of Arc in 1429, he managed a retreat to Jargeau where he was forced to surrender on 12 June. He was captured by a French squire named . Admiring the young soldier&#x27;s bravery, the earl decided to knight him before surrendering. This dubbing has remained famous in French history and literature and has been recounted by the writer Alexandre Dumas. He remained a prisoner of Charles VII for two years, and was ransomed in 1431, after fourteen years&#x27; continuous field service.

After his return to the Kingdom of England in 1434, he was made Constable of Wallingford Castle. He became a courtier and a close ally of Cardinal Henry Beaufort. Despite the diplomatic failure of the Congress of Arras, the cardinal&#x27;s authority remained strong and Suffolk gained increasing influence.

His most notable accomplishment in this period was negotiating the marriage of King Henry VI with Margaret of Anjou in 1444, which he achieved despite initial reluctance, and included a two years&#x27; truce. This earned him a promotion from Earl to Marquess of Suffolk. However, a secret clause was put in the agreement which gave Maine and Anjou back to France, which was to contribute to his downfall.

With the deaths in 1447 of Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester (shortly after his arrest for treason), and Cardinal Beaufort, Suffolk became the principal power behind the throne of the weak and compliant Henry VI. In short order, he was appointed Chamberlain, Admiral of England, and to several other important offices. He was created Earl of Pembroke in 1447, and Duke of Suffolk in 1448. However, Suffolk was suspected of responsibility in Humphrey&#x27;s death, and later of being a traitor.

On 16 July he met in secret with Jean, Count de Dunois, at his mansion of the Rose in Candlewick Street, the first of several meetings in London at which they planned a French invasion. Suffolk passed Council minutes to Dunois, the French hero of the Siege of Orleans. It was rumoured that Suffolk never paid his ransom of £20,000 owed to Dunois. The Lord Treasurer, Ralph Cromwell, wanted heavy taxes from Suffolk; the duke&#x27;s powerful enemies included John Paston and Sir John Fastolf. Many blamed Suffolk&#x27;s retainers for lawlessness in East Anglia.
Before he left on exile, exile that would lead to his death and beheading on the ship before he cleared England he sat down and wrote a letter to his son, John, just eight years old and presumably still with his mother Alice Chaucer. The letter survives, and it helps bring a medieval character to life.My dear and only well-beloved son, I beseech our Lord in Heaven, the Maker of all the World, to bless you, and to send you ever grace to love him, and to dread him, to the which, as far as a father may charge his child, I both charge you, and pray you to set all your spirits and wits to do, and to know his holy laws and commandments, by the which you shall, with his great mercy, pass all the great tempests and troubles of this wretched world.

And that also, knowingly, you do nothing for love nor dread of any earthly creature that should displease him. And there as any frailty maketh you to fall, beseech his mercy soon to call you to him again with repentance, satisfaction, and contrition of your heart, never more in will to offend him.

Secondly, next him above all earthly things, to be true liegeman in heart, in will, in thought, in deed, unto the king our aldermost high and dread sovereign lord, to whom both you and I be so much bound to; charging you as father can and may, rather to die than to be the contrary, or to know anything that were against the welfare or prosperity of his most royal person, but that as far as your body and life may stretch you live and die to defend it, and to let his highness have knowledge thereof in all the haste you can.

Thirdly, in the same way, I charge you, my dear son, always as you be bounden by the commandment of God to do, to love, to worship, your lady and mother; and also that you obey always her commandments, and to believe her counsels and advices in all your works, the which dread not but shall be best and truest to you. And if any other body would steer you to the contrary, to flee the counsel in any wise, for you shall find it naught and evil.

Furthermore, as far as father may and can, I charge you in any wise to flee the company and counsel of proud men, of covetous men, and of flattering men, the more especially and mightily to withstand them, and not to draw nor to meddle with them, with all your might and power; and to draw to you and to your company good and virtuous men, and such as be of good conversation, and of truth, and by them shall you never be deceived nor repent you of.

Moreover, never follow your own wit in nowise, but in all your works, of such folks as I write of above, ask your advice and counsel, and doing thus, with the mercy of God, you shall do right well, and live in right much worship, and great heart&#x27;s rest and ease.

And I will be to you as good lord and father as my heart can think.

And last of all, as heartily and as lovingly as ever father blessed his child in earth, I give you the blessing of Our Lord and of me, which of his infinite mercy increase you in all virtue and good living; and that your blood may by his grace from kindred to kindred multiply in this earth to his service, in such wise as after the departing from this wretched world here, you and they may glorify him eternally amongst his angels in heaven.

Written of mine hand,

The day of my departing from this land.

Your true and loving fatherThe following three years saw the near-complete loss of the English possessions in northern France (Rouen, Normandy etc.). Suffolk could not avoid taking the blame for these failures, partly because of the loss of Maine and Anjou through his marriage negotiations regarding Henry VI. When parliament met in November 1449, the opposition showed its strength by forcing the treasurer, Adam Moleyns, to resign.

Moleyns was murdered by sailors at Portsmouth on 9 January 1450. Suffolk, realising that an attack on himself was inevitable, boldly challenged his enemies in parliament, appealing to the long and honourable record of his public services. However, on 28 January he was arrested, imprisoned in the Tower of London and impeached in parliament by the Commons. 

The King intervened to protect his favourite, who was banished for five years, but on his journey to Calais his ship was intercepted by the ship &quot;Nicholas of the Tower&quot;. Suffolk was captured, subjected to a mock trial, and executed by beheading. His body was later found on the sands near Dover, and was probably brought to a church in Suffolk, possibly Wingfield. He was interred in the Carthusian Priory in Hull by his widow Alice, as was his wish, and not in the church at Wingfield, as is often stated. The Priory, founded in 1377 by his grandfather the first Earl of Suffolk, was dissolved in 1539, and most of the original buildings did not survive the two Civil War sieges of Hull in 1642 and 1643.

== Feud with John Mowbray, 3rd Duke of Norfolk ==
From the 1430s until his death, de la Pole, who became increasingly powerful, both at court and in the region, was rivalled in East Anglia by John Mowbray, 3rd Duke of Norfolk. Mowbray had enough political clout in the 1430s to control parliamentary representation in Suffolk, but the local importance of the duke weakened his grasp. Mowbray clashed with de la Pole, and committed many illegalities doing so. These included damaging property of rivals, assaults, false allegations of outlawry (with confiscation of goods), and even murder.

For Mowbray, East Anglia as the focus of his landed authority was forced upon him since this was where the majority of his estates were located. He was then a newcomer to political society in the region, and had to share influence with others. By the time of his majority, de la Pole—with his links to central government and the King—was an established power in the region. He hindered Mowbray&#x27;s attempts at regional domination for over a decade, leading to a feud that stretched from the moment Mowbray became Duke of Norfolk to the murder of de la Pole in 1450. The feud was often violent, and led to fighting between their followers. In 1435, Robert Wingfield, Mowbray&#x27;s steward of Framlingham, led a group of Mowbray retainers who murdered James Andrew, one of de la Pole&#x27;s men. When local aldermen attempted to arrest Wingfield&#x27;s party, the latter rained arrow fire upon the aldermen, but Mowbray secured royal pardons for those responsible.

By 1440, de la Pole was a royal favourite. He instigated Mowbray&#x27;s imprisonment on at least two occasions: in 1440 and in 1448. The first saw him bound over for the significant amount of £10,000, and confined to living within the royal Household, preventing him from returning to seek revenge in East Anglia. Likewise, apart from an appointment to commissions of oyer and terminer in Norwich in 1443 (after the suppression of Gladman&#x27;s Insurrection), he received no other significant offices or patronage from the crown. A recent biographer of Mowbray&#x27;s, the historian Colin Richmond, has described this as Mowbray&#x27;s &quot;eclipse&quot;. De la Pole fought Mowbray with what one contemporary labelled &quot;greet hevyng an shoving.&quot;

==Marriage and descendants==
Suffolk was married on 11 November 1430 (date of licence), to (as her third husband) Alice Chaucer (1404–1475), daughter of Thomas Chaucer of Ewelme, Oxfordshire, and granddaughter of the poet Geoffrey Chaucer and his wife, Philippa Roet. In 1437, Henry VI licensed the couple to establish a chantry and almshouse for thirteen poor men at Ewelme, which they endowed with land at Ewelme and in Buckinghamshire, Hampshire and Wiltshire; the charitable trust continues to this day.

Suffolk&#x27;s only known legitimate son, John, became the second Duke of Suffolk in 1463. Suffolk also fathered an illegitimate daughter, Jane de la Pole. Her mother is said to have been a nun, Malyne de Cay. The nighte before that he was yolden [yielded himself up in surrender to the Franco-Scottish forces of Joan of Arc on 12 June 1429] he laye in bed with a nonne whom he toke oute of holy profession and defouled, whose name was Malyne de Cay, by whom he gate a daughter, now married to Stonard of Oxonfordshire. 

Jane de la Pole (died 28 February 1494) was married before 1450 to Thomas Stonor (1423–1474), of Stonor in Pyrton, Oxfordshire. 

==Jackanapes==

Suffolk&#x27;s nickname &quot;Jackanapes&quot; came from &quot;Jack of Naples&quot;, a slang name for a monkey at the time. This was probably due to his heraldic badge, which consisted of an &quot;ape&#x27;s clog&quot;, i.e. a wooden block chained to a pet monkey to prevent it from escaping. The term &quot;jackanape&quot; later came to mean an impertinent or conceited person, due to the popular perception of Suffolk as a &quot;nouveau riche&quot; upstart; his great-grandfather Sir William de la Pole had been a wool merchant from Hull.

==Portrayals in drama, verse and prose==

*Suffolk is a major character in two Shakespeare plays. His negotiation of the marriage of Henry and Margaret is portrayed in &quot;Henry VI, Part 1&quot;. Shakespeare&#x27;s version has Suffolk fall in love with Margaret. He negotiates the marriage so that he and she can be close to one another. His disgrace and death are depicted in &quot;Henry VI, Part 2&quot;. Shakespeare departs from the historical record by having Henry banish Suffolk for complicity in the murder of Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester. Suffolk is murdered by a pirate named Walter Whitmore (fulfilling a prophecy given earlier in the play proclaiming he will &quot;die by Water&quot;), and Margaret later wanders to her castle carrying his severed head and grieving.
*His murder is the subject of the traditional English folk ballad &quot;Six Dukes Went a-Fishing&quot; (Roud #78)
*Suffolk is the protagonist in Susan Curran&#x27;s historical novel &quot;The Heron&#x27;s Catch&quot; (1989).
* He plays a role in many of the seventeen Dame Frevisse detective novels of Margaret Frazer, set in England in the 1440s.
*Suffolk is a significant character in Cynthia Harnett&#x27;s historical novel for children, &quot;The Writing on the Hearth&quot; (1971)
*Suffolk is one of the three dedicatees of Geoffrey Hill&#x27;s sonnet sequence, &quot;Funeral Music&quot; (first published in &quot;Stand&quot; magazine; collected in &quot;King Log&quot;, Andre Deutsch 1968). Hill speculates about him in the essay appended to the poems.
*Suffolk is one of the main characters in Conn Iggulden&#x27;s &quot;Wars of the Roses: Stormbird&quot;, about the end of the Hundred Years&#x27; War and the start of the Wars of the Roses.

<text>Nordskog Records was a jazz record company and label founded by Andrae Nordskog in 1921 in Santa Monica, California.

The label&#x27;s recording studio and factory were in Los Angeles. It issued 27 double-sided discs. It had no pressing plant, so it contracted with Arto Records of Orange, New Jersey. Wax masters were shipped across country by railroad; many melted on the trip across the desert. By some accounts among the recordings lost were sessions by Jelly Roll Morton and King Oliver.

Among the records which survived were the only recordings of Eva Tanguay, early sides by Abe Lyman&#x27;s Orchestra, Henry Halstead&#x27;s Orchestra, and a number of recordings by Kid Ory&#x27;s band. The Ory sides were the first recorded jazz by an African American band from New Orleans.

In 1923, Arto filed for bankruptcy. Nordskog sued for the return of some 80 unissued masters, with mothers and stampers then in Arto&#x27;s possession, but failed to regain anything. Nordskog went out of business.

The labels proclaim Nordskog records to be &quot;The Golden-Voiced Records&quot;.

<text>John Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset, 3rd Earl of Somerset (25 March 1404 – 27 May 1444) was an English nobleman and military commander during the Hundred Years&#x27; War. He was a paternal first cousin of King Henry V and the maternal grandfather of Henry VII.

==Origins==

Born on 25 March 1404, he was the second son of John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset, the eldest of the four legitimised children of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, by his mistress Katherine Swynford. John of Gaunt was the third surviving son of King Edward III. His mother was Margaret Holland, a daughter of Thomas Holland, 2nd Earl of Kent, the son of Joan &quot;the Fair Maid of Kent&quot;, a granddaughter of King Edward I and wife of Edward the Black Prince (eldest brother of John of Gaunt) and mother of King Richard II.

==Career==
In 1418 he became 3rd Earl of Somerset, having succeeded his elder brother Henry Beaufort, 2nd Earl of Somerset (1401–1418), who died unmarried, aged 17, whilst fighting for the Lancastrian cause at the Siege of Rouen in France, under the command of their uncle Thomas Beaufort, Duke of Exeter (1377–1426). 

===French campaign and imprisonment===
He fought in the 1419 French campaigns of his cousin King Henry V. In 1421 he accompanied his step-father Thomas of Lancaster, Duke of Clarence (the king&#x27;s younger brother) on a campaign in Anjou, France. Thomas was killed at the Battle of Baugé (22 March 1421), while Somerset and his younger brother were captured and imprisoned for 17 years. On 25 March 1425 Somerset came into his majority, but his paternal estates had to be managed by his mother for the next thirteen years of his imprisonment. He remained imprisoned until 1438 and having been ransomed, became one of the leading English commanders in France.

==Created Duke of Somerset==

In 1443 John was created Duke of Somerset and Earl of Kendal, was made a Knight of the Garter and appointed Captain-General of Guyenne. He presided over a period during which England lost much territory in France and proved a poor commander. Humphrey of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Gloucester, regent for the young King Henry VI, was unable to control the administration of justice and finance, which led to widespread lawlessness. At the beginning of the second lieutenantcy of Richard, Duke of York, Gloucester declined the office of Lieutenant-Governor, which was then accepted by Somerset, who drew from it a salary of 600 pounds.

He was appointed Admiral of the Sea to the army commander John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, who from August 1440 besieged Harfleur, which had been in French hands for five months. King Charles VII of France sent a large army under Richemont. The English dug a double ditch rampart with only 1,000 men, while Somerset&#x27;s squadron prevented a French landing by sea, using archers to pick off the enemy at short range. Having been thus frustrated the French withdrew to Paris and lifted the siege. The town surrendered to the English and was re-occupied. York was incensed that John&#x27;s uncle Cardinal Henry Beaufort advised the king to sue for peace. Somerset advised King Henry that peace was humanitarian and that the king of France was determined to seize Pontoise. When York arrived in Normandy in 1441 to the campaign, Somerset had resigned. But the fall of Pontoise to Charles, Duke of Orléans in September 1441 weakened English garrisons and in Gascony the situation was even worse. The Beauforts sent Sir Edward Hull, who arrived at Bordeaux on 22 October 1442, to inform York that a huge army would arrive commanded by Somerset. York was ordered to fortify Rouen; just as the king and Dauphin of France were threatening Bordeaux and Aquitaine and seized the town of Dax Somerset dithered; York was held back as Guyenne was being lost.

Meanwhile, the Duke of York, fighting alongside the tactician Lord Talbot, had been appointed Lieutenant for all France. With the Duke of Gloucester&#x27;s wife Eleanor charged with treason, Somerset took the opportunity in April 1443 to declare himself Lieutenant of Aquitaine and Captain-General of Guyenne. By then, the negotiations Somerset had started as Captain-General of Calais had failed. These two factors turned York against the Beauforts. But the last straw was the payment of £25,000 to Somerset while York remained heavily in debt. Furthermore, Guyenne was consuming precious resources otherwise destined for Normandy.

==Death and burial==
In August 1443, Somerset led 7,000 men to Cherbourg and marched south to Gascony; the duke was ill. He blundered into Guerche, a Breton town with which England had signed a peace treaty. But Somerset set all prisoners free, accepting money from the Duke of Brittany. Marching aimlessly through Maine, he returned that winter to England. His death in 1444, possibly by suicide, and that of his uncle the Cardinal, marked the end of Beaufort influence and left the door open for William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk, to dominate the government. The lasting effect of these events was burning resentment between the House of York and the remaining members of the Beaufort family.

==Marriage and issue==
In 1439 he married Margaret Beauchamp, a daughter of Sir John Beauchamp, &quot;de jure&quot; 3rd Baron Beauchamp (d.1412/14) of Bletsoe in Bedfordshire, by his second wife Edith Stourton, a daughter of Sir John Stourton of Stourton, Wiltshire. By his wife he had an only daughter and sole heiress:
*Lady Margaret Beaufort (1443–1509), who married Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond (1430–1456) by whom she was the mother of King Henry VII, the first of the Tudor dynasty.

==Succession==
As he died without male issue his dukedom went extinct but his earldom passed to his younger brother Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset (1406–1455). As Edmund was later granted the title Duke of Somerset, he is often called 2nd Duke of Somerset though he did not inherit the title from his brother.

===Illegitimate issue===
His illegitimate issue included:
* Tacine of Somerset, who, being foreign-born, was made a denizen of England 20 June 1443. She married (before 29 September 1447) Reynold (or Reginald) Grey, 7th Lord Grey of Wilton by whom she had one son:
** John Grey, 8th Lord Grey of Wilton; 
* John of Somerset (–1453)

==Titles and styles==
* 1st Duke of Somerset (28 August 1443 – 27 May 1444)
* 1st Earl of Kendal (28 August 1443 – 27 May 1444)
* 3rd Earl of Somerset (25 November 1418 – 27 May 1444)

<text>Sunshine Records was a small California-based record label of the early 1920s, producing 6 double-sided phonograph records of early jazz and blues.

The labels of Sunshine Records say that they were &quot;Manuf. by Spikes Bros. Phonograph Co. Inc. Los Angeles&quot;, but they were all actually manufactured by Nordskog Records, and also issued by Nordskog. Most Sunshine Records simply have the Sunshine label pasted over the Nordskog label. (It is believed that the labels were supposed to be pressed onto the records, but Arto Records, who pressed Nordskog&#x27;s records, made this error.)

The Spikes Brothers (John and Reb Spikes) were the owner/operators of a Los Angeles, California music store which catered to the city&#x27;s African-American community. The Spikes Brothers also published sheet music both by themselves and other songwriters, mostly, they later recalled, to help draw attention to numbers they hoped to sell to national music publishers. The Spikes Brothers arranged with Nordskog to sell copies of records by African-American artists in their store on their own label. It is believed that all copies of the rare Sunshine Records were sold only at the Spikes Brothers Music Store.

All of the Sunshine Records feature Kid Ory&#x27;s New Orleans jazz band. Two sides are instrumentals by the band; on the rest Ory&#x27;s group accompanies singers Roberta Dudley and Ruth Lee.

Back in 1995, Sunshine Records signed the upcoming rapper - Skee-Lo and he released his hit album ‘I Wish’. He left the label only five months after due to a dispute with Sunshine Records.

<doc id="236122" wikidata="Q572437" url="?curid=236122" title="Don't Say a Word">
<text>Don&#x27;t Say a Word is a 2001 American psychological thriller film starring Michael Douglas, Sean Bean, Brittany Murphy, Guy Torry, Jennifer Esposito, Famke Janssen, Skye McCole Bartusiak and Oliver Platt based on the novel &quot;Don&#x27;t Say a Word&quot; by Andrew Klavan. It was directed by Gary Fleder and written by Anthony Peckham and Patrick Smith Kelly. It was released on September 28, 2001, receiving negative reviews from critics and grossing $100 million against its $50 million budget.

==Plot==
In 1991, a gang of thieves steal a rare $10-million gem, but, in the process, two of the gang double-cross their leader, Patrick Koster, and take off with the precious stone.

Ten years later, on the day before Thanksgiving, prominent Manhattan private practice child psychiatrist, Dr. Nathan R. Conrad, is invited by his friend and former colleague, Dr. Louis Sachs, to examine a &quot;disturbed&quot; young lady named Elisabeth Burrows at the state sanatorium.

Having been released from prison two weeks earlier, Patrick and the remaining gang members break into an apartment which overlooks Nathan&#x27;s apartment, where he lives with his wife Aggie and daughter Jessie. Nathan is informed by Patrick that Elisabeth is only pretending to be insane to hide in the institution from this gang that is searching for the gem. That evening, Patrick kidnaps Jessie as a means of forcing Nathan to acquire a six-digit number from Elisabeth&#x27;s memory. As Nathan visits Elisabeth, she is reluctant at first, but he gains her trust laterespecially when he reveals the situation with Jessie. Sachs admits to Nathan that the gang who kidnapped Jessie also kidnapped his girlfriend to force him to acquire the number from Elisabeth. Sachs is then visited by Detective Sandra Cassidy, who reveals to him that his girlfriend has been found dead. Meanwhile, Aggie hears Jessie&#x27;s voice and realizes the kidnappers reside in the nearby apartment. The kidnappers send one of them to kill Aggie while the others escape with Jessie, but Aggie sets an ambush and kills him.

After Nathan takes Elisabeth out of the sanatorium, she remembers certain events regarding the gang. It is revealed that Elisabeth&#x27;s father was the gang member who double crossed the others and kept the gem. However, other members of the gang later found him and ordered him to reveal where he had hidden the gem, subsequently pushing him in front of a subway train. The gang members were arrested immediately, and Elisabeth escaped with her doll in which the gem was hidden. She also remembers that the required number, 815508, is the number of her father&#x27;s grave at Hart Island and that her doll is placed beside him in the coffin. She explains that she had stowed away on a boat that was taking her father&#x27;s coffin for burial in Potter&#x27;s field on Hart Island, where the gravediggers put the doll, named Mischka, inside.

Nathan and Elisabeth steal a boat to reach Hart Island. The gang members track them down and demand that Nathan give them the number they want. Elisabeth reveals the number and Patrick orders his companion to exhume her father&#x27;s coffin after releasing Jessie. He finds the doll and the gem hidden inside it. He then decides to kill Nathan and Elisabeth, but Cassidy arrives before he can shoot them. Patrick&#x27;s companion is shot by Cassidy, but Patrick manages to wound her. Taking advantage of the confusion, Nathan takes the gem from Patrick and throws it into an open mass grave. Nathan kicks Patrick into the grave, and then triggers a collapse of its sides, filling the grave with dirt and burying Patrick alive. Nathan reunites with Aggie and Jessie, thanks Cassidy, and invites Elisabeth to live with them.

==Cast==

==Production==
In September 2000, it was announced Regency Enterprises and 20th Century Fox would commence production on an adaptation of &quot;Don&#x27;t Say a Word&quot; by Andrew Klavan with Gary Fleder set to direct and Michael Douglas to star.

An earlier version of the script did not feature the investigation side-plot set around Detective Sandra Cassidy. Although the film is entirely set in New York, shooting took place in winter 2000 in both New York and Toronto. Due to the film&#x27;s release nearly three weeks after the September 11 attacks, the filmmakers contemplated delaying the movie, but ultimately decided against it. However, they cut out and replaced shots of the World Trade Center from the edit, such as the opening shot, which now instead shows Brooklyn.

==Soundtrack==
The film&#x27;s musical score was composed by Mark Isham. The soundtrack was released on CD from Varèse Sarabande that contains eight score selections from various scenes, including Heist, Kidnapped and the horrific events at Subway.

==Reception==
=== Critical response ===
&quot;Don&#x27;t Say a Word&quot; received poor reviews from critics. 

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film two and a half stars out of four, deeming that &quot;the movie as a whole looks and occasionally plays better than it is&quot; and praising Gary Fleder&#x27;s &quot;poetic visual touch&quot; as well as Brittany Murphy&#x27;s and Sky McCole Bartusiak&#x27;s performances. Conversely, in his review for &quot;Empire&quot;, Kim Newman found the film bland and thought it &quot;rarely manages to make you forget its blatant silliness&quot;. He did however praise the female cast, in particular Famke Janssen.

===Box office===
The film earned over $100 million worldwide against a budget of $50 million.

<doc id="236125" wikidata="Q7443579" url="?curid=236125" title="Second Taranaki War">
<text>The Second Taranaki War is a term used by some historians for the period of hostilities between Māori and the New Zealand Government in the Taranaki district of New Zealand between 1863 and 1866. The term is avoided by some historians, who either describe the conflicts as merely a series of West Coast campaigns that took place between the Taranaki War (1860–1861) and Titokowaru&#x27;s War (1868–69), or an extension of the First Taranaki War.

The conflict, which overlapped the wars in Waikato and Tauranga, was fuelled by a combination of factors: lingering Māori resentment over the sale of land at Waitara in 1860 and government delays in resolving the issue; a large-scale land confiscation policy launched by the government in late 1863; and the rise of the so-called Hauhau movement, an extremist part of the Pai Marire syncretic religion, which was strongly opposed to the alienation of Māori land and eager to strengthen Māori identity. The Hauhau movement became a unifying factor for Taranaki Māori in the absence of individual Māori commanders.

The style of warfare after 1863 differed markedly from that of the 1860-61 conflict, in which Māori had taken set positions and challenged the army to an open contest. From 1863 the army, working with greater numbers of troops and heavy artillery, systematically took possession of Māori land by driving off the inhabitants, adopting a &quot;scorched earth&quot; strategy of laying waste to Māori villages and cultivations, with attacks on villages, whether warlike or otherwise. As the troops advanced, the Government built an expanding line of redoubts, behind which settlers built homes and developed farms. The effect was a creeping confiscation of almost a million acres (4,000 km2) of land, with little distinction between the land of loyal or rebel Māori owners.

The Government&#x27;s war policy was opposed by the British commander, General Duncan Cameron, who clashed with Governor Sir George Grey and offered his resignation in February 1865. He left New Zealand six months later. Cameron, who viewed the war as a form of land plunder, had urged the Colonial Office to withdraw British troops from New Zealand and from the end of 1865 the Imperial forces began to leave, replaced by an expanding New Zealand military force. Among the new colonial forces were specialist Forest Ranger units, which embarked on lengthy search-and-destroy missions deep into the bush.

The Waitangi Tribunal has argued that apart from the attack on Sentry Hill in April 1864, there was an absence of Māori aggression throughout the entire Second War, and that therefore Māori were never actually at war. It concluded: &quot;In so far as Māori fought at all – and few did – they were merely defending their &quot;kainga&quot;, crops and land against military advance and occupation.&quot;

==Background and causes of the war==
The conflict in Taranaki had its roots in the First Taranaki War, which had ended in March 1861 with an uneasy truce. Neither side fulfilled the terms of the truce, leaving many of the issues unresolved. Chief among those issues was (1) the legality of the sale of a block of land at Waitara, which had sparked the first war, but Māori unrest was exacerbated by (2) a new land confiscation strategy launched by the Government and (3) the emergence of a fiery nationalist religious movement.

===Disputed Waitara land===
In 1861 Governor Thomas Gore Browne had promised to investigate the legitimacy of the sale of the Waitara land, but as delays continued, Taranaki and Ngāti Ruanui Māori became increasingly impatient. During the earlier war they had driven settlers off farmland at Omata and Tataraimaka, 20 km south of New Plymouth, and occupied it, claiming it by right of conquest and vowing to hold it until the Waitara land was returned to them. On 12 March 1863, 300 men from the 57th Regiment, led by Colonel Sir Henry James Warre, marched out to Omata to retake the land and a month later, on 4 April, Browne&#x27;s successor, Governor Sir George Grey, marched to Tataraimaka with troops and built a redoubt and re-occupied the land in what the Waitangi Tribunal described as a hostile act. The five tribes encamped in the area – Atiawa, Taranaki, Ngatiruanui, Nga Rauru and Whanganui – promptly requested assistance from Ngāti Maniapoto and Waikato Māori to respond to what they regarded as an act of war.

In a despatch to London Grey wrote that he had failed to shake the &quot;dogged determination&quot; of Māori on the Waitara question. &quot;A great part of the native race,&quot; he wrote, &quot;may be stated to be at the present moment in arms, in a state of chronic discontent ... Large numbers of them have renounced the Queen&#x27;s authority, and many of them declare openly that they have been so wronged that they will never return under it ... the great majority of them declare that if war arises from this cause, they will rise and make a simultaneous attack upon the several European settlements in the Northern Island. The reasons they urge for such proceedings are ... that the people of the Waitara, without having been guilty of any crime, were driven at the point of the sword from villages, houses, and homes which they had occupied for years. That a great crime had been committed against them. That through all future generations it will be told that their lands have been forcibly and unlawfully taken from them by officers appointed by the Queen of the United Kingdom. They argue that they have no hope of obtaining justice, that their eventual extermination is determined on; but that all that is left to them is to die like men, after a long and desperate struggle; and that the sooner they can bring that on before our preparations are further matured, and our numbers increased, the greater is their chance of success.&quot;

A month later Grey began planning to return Waitara to the Māori, and on 11 May issued a proclamation renouncing all government claims to the land. But he did nothing to signal his intention and on 4 May, a week before he acted, Māori began killing British troops traversing their land. The Government declared those killings to be the outbreak of a new Taranaki war and Grey immediately wrote to the Colonial Office in London, requesting three additional regiments be sent to New Zealand. He also ordered the return to New Plymouth of troops that had been moved to Auckland at the close of the earlier Taranaki hostilities, where they had been building a road southward in preparation for the invasion of the Waikato.

===Land confiscations===
In December 1863 the Parliament passed the New Zealand Settlements Act 1863, a piece of punitive legislation allowing unlimited confiscation of Māori land by the government, ostensibly as a means of suppressing &quot;rebellion&quot;. Under the Act, Māori who had been &quot;in rebellion&quot; could be stripped of their land, which would be surveyed, divided and either given as 20 hectare farms to military settlers as a means of establishing and maintaining peace, or sold to recover the costs of fighting Māori. Volunteers were enlisted from among gold miners in Otago and Melbourne for military service and a total of 479,848 hectares were confiscated in Taranaki by means of proclamations in January and September 1865. Little distinction was made between the land of &quot;rebels&quot; and Māori loyal to the government.

According to the Waitangi Tribunal, Māori recognised that the British intention was to seize the greater part of their land for European settlement through a policy of confiscation and saw that their best hope of keeping their homes, lands and status lay in taking up arms. The 1927 Royal Commission on Confiscated Land, chaired by senior Supreme Court judge Sir William Sim, concluded: &quot;The Natives were treated as rebels and war declared against them before they had engaged in rebellion of any kind ... In their eyes the fight was not against the Queen&#x27;s sovereignty, but a struggle for house and home.&quot;

===The rise of Hauhauism===
In 1862 the so-called Hauhau Movement emerged among Taranaki Māori. The movement was an extremist part of the Pai Mārire religion that was both violent and vehemently anti-Pākehā. Adherence to the Hauhau movement, which included incantations, a sacred pole, belief in supernatural protection from bullets, and occasionally beheadings, the removal of the hearts of enemy and cannibalism, spread rapidly through the North Island from 1864, welding tribes in a bond of passionate hatred against the Pākehā.

==Hostilities resume==
Two hui were held by Taranaki, Ngāti Ruanui, Ngā Rauru and Whanganui iwi. The first, held on 3 July 1861 at Wiriwiri near Manaia, Taranaki, resulted in most of the 1,000 people present pledging support for the Kīngitanga Movement. The second, held at Kapoaiaia near Cape Egmont in July 1862 involving 600 members, involved the decision that Tataraimaka, Kaipopo, Waiwakaiho, Waitaha and Waitara were Māori lands, and that any attempt to create a road south of Waireka near Omata by European settlers would be considered an act of war. By December 1862, work on the road had extended west past Waireka to Okurukuru, and by early 1863, Tamati Hone Oraukawa led a Ngāti Ruanui party north to support Taranaki iwi, if British troops re-occupied Tataraimaka. Grey, while visiting the Waikato in January 1863, indicated that he intended to send troops to retake Tataraimaka.

On 4 March 1863, Grey arrived at New Plymouth alongside General Duncan Cameron, Dillon Bell and Colonial Secretary Alfred Domett. Between this time and early April, British troops established redoubts south and west of Omata, reaching Tataraimaka. In March 1863 a group of Māori encamped on land they had seized at Tataraimaka were ousted with force by British troops in what they regarded as an act of war. The Waitangi Tribunal, in its 1996 report, also claimed the military reoccupation of Tataraimaka was a hostile act that implied war had been unilaterally resumed.

Two months later, on 4 May 1863, a party of about 40 Māori ambushed a small military party of the 57th Regiment on a coastal road west of Ōakura, killing all but one of the 10 soldiers as an act of revenge. The ambush may have been planned as an assassination attempt on Grey, who regularly rode the track between New Plymouth and the Tataraimaka military post. Three weeks later Māori laid another ambush near the Poutoko Redoubt, from New Plymouth, injuring a mounted officer of the 57th Regiment.

The Militia and Taranaki Rifle Volunteers were called up for guard and patrol duty around New Plymouth and in June a 50-man corps of forest rangers was formed within the Taranaki Rifles by Captain Harry Atkinson to follow Māori into the bush and clear the country surrounding New Plymouth of hostile bands. The force was later expanded to two companies and named the Taranaki Bush Rangers.

On 4 June the new British commander, Lieutenant-General Duncan Cameron, led 870 members of the 57th Regiment and 70th Regiment to attack and defeat a party of about 50 Māori still occupying the Tataraimaka block beside the Katikara River. 29 Māori and one soldier from the 57th Regiment were killed in the engagement. The Māori were also shelled by HMS &quot;Eclipse&quot; from about offshore.

On 2 October a large force of the 57th Regiment, Volunteers and militia engaged Māori near Poutoko Redoubt, Omata, 9 km south of New Plymouth. Victoria Crosses were awarded to two members of the 57th, Ensign John Thornton Down and Drummer Dudley Stagpoole, for bravery during the battle.

==The Hauhau movement intervenes==

In late 1863 Taranaki Māori built a strongly entrenched position at Kaitake, high on a steep ridge overlooking Ōakura. The pā was shelled in December by the 57th Regiment and through the week of 20 to 25 March 1864, the pā and nearby fortifications at Te Tutu and Ahuahu were stormed and taken by a force of 420 of the 57th, 70th and Volunteers and Militia commanded by Colonel Sir Henry James Warre, with four Armstrong guns. Cultivations of more than 2.5ha of maize, potatoes, tobacco and other crops were also found in bush clearings and destroyed. Kaitake was occupied by a company of the 57th Regiment and a company of the Otago Volunteers.

Almost a fortnight later, on 6 April, a combined force of 57th Regiment and the newly formed Taranaki Military Settlers, a total of 101 men, set off from Kaitake to destroy native crops near the Ahuahu village, set amid dense bush south of Ōakura. A detachment suffered 19 casualties – seven killed and 12 wounded – after being surprised by a Māori attack as they rested without their weapons at the order of their commander, Captain P.W.J. Lloyd. Māori casualties were slight. The naked bodies of the seven dead, including Lloyd, were later recovered; all had been decapitated as part of a Hauhau rite. The mutilations were the first of a series inflicted on British and New Zealand soldiers carried out by Hauhau devotees between 1864 and 1873. Lloyd had only recently arrived in New Zealand from England and his lack of caution was blamed on his unfamiliarity with Māori war tactics. The easy victory of the Māori over the numerically stronger British-led force gave a powerful impetus to the Hauhau movement. The heads of the slain soldiers were later discovered to have been taken to the east coast as part of a Pai Marire recruitment drive.

===Attack on Sentry Hill===
Three weeks later, on 30 April 1864, the measure of devotion to the Hauhau movement displayed itself in the reckless march by 200 warriors on the Sentry Hill redoubt, 9 km north-east of New Plymouth, in a one-sided battle that cost the lives of possibly a fifth of the Māori force. The redoubt had been built in late 1863 by Captain W. B. Messenger and 120 men of the Military Settlers on the crown of a hill that was the site of an ancient pā, and garrisoned by a detachment of 75 men from the 57th Regiment under Captain Shortt, with two Coehorn mortars. The construction of the outpost was regarded by the Atiawa as a challenge, being built close to the Māori position at Manutahi and on their land. In April 1864 a war party was formed of the best fighting men from the west coast iwi that had joined the rapidly spreading Hauhau movement. In a 1920 interview with historian James Cowan, Te Kahu-Pukoro, a fighter who took part in the attack, explained: &quot;The Pai-marire religion was then new, and we were all completely under its influence and firmly believed in the teaching of Te Ua and his apostles. Hepanaia Kapewhiti was at the head of the war-party. He was our prophet. He taught us the Pai-marire karakia (chant), and told us that if we repeated it as we went into battle the Pākehā bullets would not strike us. This we all believed.&quot;

Led by Hepanaia, the warriors participated in sacred ceremonies around a pole at the Manutahi pā, with all the principal Taranaki chiefs present: Wiremu Kīngi Te Rangitāke and Kingi Parengarenga, as well as Te Whiti and Tohu Kākahi, both of whom would later become prophets at Parihaka. The force, armed with muskets, shotguns, tomahawks and spears, marched to Sentry Hill and at 8am launched their attack, ascending the slope that led to the redoubt. Te Kahu-Pukoro recalled:

About 34 Māori and one imperial soldier were killed. Among those shot dead, at almost point-blank range, were chiefs Hepanaia, Kingi Parengarenga (Taranaki), Tupara Keina (Ngatiawa), Tamati Hone (Ngati Ruanui) and Hare Te Kokai, who had advocated the frontal attack on the redoubt. According to Cowan, the slaughter temporarily weakened the new confidence in Pai-marire, but chief prophet Te Ua had a satisfying explanation: that those who fell were to blame because they did not repose absolute faith in the karakia, or incantation.

===Return to Te Arei===
On 8 September 1864 a force of 450 men of the 70th Regiment and Bushrangers returned to Te Arei, scene of the final British campaign of the First Taranaki War, and took the Hauhau pā of Manutahi after its inhabitants abandoned it, cutting down the niu flagstaff and destroying the palisading and &quot;whare&quot;, or homes, inside. Three days later Colonel Warre led a strong force of the 70th Regiment as well as 50 &quot;kupapa&quot; (&quot;friendly&quot; Māori) to Te Arei and also took possession of the recently abandoned stronghold.

===Wanganui area campaigns===
The focus of Hauhau activities shifted south with the Battle of Moutoa, on the Wanganui River, on 14 May 1864, in which Lower Wanganui &quot;kupapa&quot; routed a Hauhau war party intending to raid Wanganui. Among the 50 Hauhau killed was the prophet Matene Rangitauira, while the defending forces suffered 15 deaths. Sporadic fighting between Upper and Lower Wanganui iwi continued through to 1865 and in April 1865 a combined force of 200 Taranaki Military Settlers and Patea Rangers, under Major Willoughby Brassey of the New Zealand Militia, was sent to Pipiriki, 90 km upriver from Wanganui, to establish a military post. Three redoubts were built above the river, an act that was taken by local Māori as a challenge. On 19 July a force of more than 1000 Māori began a siege of the redoubts that lasted until 30 July, with heavy exchanges of fire on most days. A relief force of 300 Forest Rangers, Wanganui Rangers and Native Contingent, as well as several hundred Lower Wanganui Māori, arrived with food and ammunition but discovered the Hauhau positions abandoned. Māori losses were between 13 and 20; the colonial force suffered four wounded.

==Cameron&#x27;s West Coast campaign==

In January 1865 General Cameron took the field in the Wanganui district, under instructions by Governor Grey to secure &quot;sufficient possession&quot; of land between Wanganui and the Patea River to provide access to Waitotara. The Government claimed to have bought land at Waitotara in 1863, and in turn had sold more than in October 1864, but the sale was disputed by some Māori, who refused to leave. A secure route from Wanganui to Patea would form a key part of the Government&#x27;s strategy for a thoroughfare between Wanganui and New Plymouth, with redoubts and military settlements to protect it along the way.

Cameron&#x27;s campaign became notable for its caution and slow pace, and sparked an acrimonious series of exchanges between Governor Grey and Cameron, who developed a distaste for the operations against Māori, viewing it as a war of land plunder and explaining the campaign could not deliver the &quot;decisive blow&quot; that might induce the Māori to submit. Cameron considered that the British army did most of the fighting and suffered most of the casualties in order to enable settlers to take Māori land. Many of his soldiers also had great admiration for the Māori, for their courage and chivalrous treatment of the wounded. Cameron offered his resignation to Grey on 7 February and left New Zealand in August.

Cameron&#x27;s march from Wanganui, with about 2000 troops, mainly the 57th Regiment, began on 24 January and came under daylight attack that day and the next from Hauhau forces led by Patohe while camped on an open plain at Nukumaru, suffering more than 50 casualties and killing about 23 Māori. The Hauhau warriors were part of a contingent of 2000 based at Weraroa pā, near Waitotara, who were determined to halt Cameron&#x27;s march northward. Pai-Mārire chief prophet Te Ua Haumēne was also at the pā, but took no part in the fighting. Cameron&#x27;s force, by then boosted to 2300, moved again on 2 February, crossing the Waitotara River by raft and establishing posts at Waitotara, Patea and several other places before arriving at the Waingongoro River, between Hāwera and Manaia, on 31 March, where a large camp and redoubts were built. Troops encountered fire at Hāwera, but his only other major encounter was at Te Ngaio, in open country between Patea and Kakaramea, on 15 March when the troops were ambushed by about 200 Māori, including unarmed women. Cameron claimed 80 Māori losses, the heaviest loss of Hauhau tribes in the West Coast campaign. His force suffered one killed and three wounded in the Te Ngaio attack, which was the last military attempt by Māori to halt Cameron&#x27;s northward advance. Cameron&#x27;s own troops were also losing enthusiasm for the campaign, with one 18th-century writer reporting sympathetic Irish soldiers in the 57th Regiment saying, &quot;Begorra, it&#x27;s a murder to shoot them. Sure, they are our own people, with their potatoes and fish, and children.&quot;

Difficulties with landing supplies on the harbourless coast, as well as the recognition that the land route to New Plymouth was both difficult and hostile, convinced Cameron that it would be prudent to abandon his advance and he returned to Patea, leaving several of the redoubts manned by the 57th Regiment.

Cameron had also declined to attack Weraroa pā, claiming he had an insufficient force to besiege the stronghold and keep communications open. He also refused to waste men&#x27;s lives on the attack of such an apparently strong position. As historian B.J. Dalton points out, cited by Belich, he had already outflanked the pā, neutralising its strategic importance. By July a frustrated Grey decided to act on his own to take Weraroa, which he claimed was the key to the occupation of the West Coast. On 20 July, without Cameron&#x27;s knowledge, he joined Captain Thomas McDonnell to lead a mix of colonial forces in raids on several Hauhau villages near the pā, taking 60 prisoners. The pā was shelled the next day and Grey captured the pā after learning it had been abandoned, earning public praise after sustained criticism of the pace of Cameron&#x27;s campaign.

==Warre&#x27;s campaign==
While Cameron made his slow advance northward along the South Taranaki coast, Warre extended his string of redoubts in the north, by April 1865 establishing posts from Pukearuhe, 50 km north of New Plymouth, to Ōpunake, 80 km south of the town. The redoubts brought the length of Taranaki coastline occupied to 130 km, but the forts commanded practically only the country within rifle range of their parapets. Isolated skirmishing between Māori and British forces led to raids by Warre on 13 June to destroy villages inland of Warea, while on 29 July a mix of British troops and Taranaki Mounted Volunteers returned to Warea, burning villages and engaging in several skirmish&#x27;s with Māori they encountered; a Māori village was attacked and burnt.

==Chute&#x27;s forest campaign==
On 2 September 1865, Grey proclaimed peace to all Māori who had taken part in the West Coast &quot;rebellion&quot;, but with little effect. By 20 September there were further deaths following a Māori ambush at Warea and reprisals by the 43rd Regiment and Mounted Corps. Further skirmishing took place near Hāwera and Patea in October and November. Cameron&#x27;s replacement, Major-General Trevor Chute, arrived in New Plymouth on 20 September to take command of operations just as Premier Frederick Weld&#x27;s policy of military self-reliance took effect and the withdrawal of British troops from New Zealand began. The 70th and 65th Regiments were the first to leave the country, with Imperial regiments gradually being concentrated at Auckland.

In contrast to Cameron, who preferred to operate on the coast, Chute embarked on a series of aggressive forest operations, following Māori into their strongholds and storming pā. Following orders from Grey to open a campaign against the West Coast tribes, Chute marched from Wanganui on 30 December 1865, with 33 Royal Artillery, 280 of the 14th Regiment, 45 Forest Rangers under Major Gustavus von Tempsky, 300 Wanganui Native Contingent and other Māori with a Transport Corps of 45 men, each driving a two-horse dray.
Chute&#x27;s force burned the village of Okutuku, inland of Waverley on 3 January 1866 and stormed the pā with bayonets the next day, killing six Māori and suffering seven casualties. On 7 January they repeated the strategy at Te Putahi above the Whenuakura River, killing 14 Māori and losing two Imperial soldiers. Chute reported the Hauhau Māori had been driven inland and followed them. On 14 January he launched an attack on the strongly fortified Otapawa pā, about 8 km north of Hāwera. The pā, occupied by Tangahoe, Ngati-Ruanui and Pakakohi tribes, was considered the main stronghold of South Taranaki Hauhaus. Chute claimed 30 Māori were killed, but the deaths came at a high price: 11 of his force were killed and 20 wounded in what was describe as an impetuous frontal attack on a pā he wrongly assumed had been abandoned. The force moved northward, crossing the Waingongoro River and destroying another seven villages.

On 17 January 1866 Chute launched his most ambitious campaign, leading a force of 514, including Forest Rangers and Native Contingent, to New Plymouth along an ancient inland Māori war track to the east of Mt Taranaki. The momentum of the advance quickly ran out as they encountered a combination of heavy undergrowth and torrential rain. Carrying just three days&#x27; provisions, the column ran out of food and did not arrive in New Plymouth until 26 January, having been forced to eat a dog and two horses en route. The march was hailed as a triumph, but Belich commented: &quot;Chute narrowly escaped becoming one of the few generals to lose an army without the presence of an enemy to excuse him.&quot; Chute marched back to Wanganui via the coast road, having encircled Mt Taranaki. The five-week campaign had resulted in the destruction of seven fortified pā and 21 villages, along with cultivations and food storages, inflicting heavy casualties.

According to historian B.J. Dalton, the aim was no longer to conquer territory, but to inflict the utmost &quot;punishment&quot; on the enemy: &quot;Inevitably there was a great deal of brutality, much burning of undefended villages and indiscriminate looting, in which loyal Maoris often suffered.&quot; The Nelson &quot;Examiner&quot; reported: &quot;There were no prisoners made in these late engagements as General Chute ... does not care to encumber himself with such costly luxuries,&quot; while politician Alfred Saunders agreed there were &quot;avoidable cruelties&quot;. After reading Grey&#x27;s reports expressing his satisfaction with the Chute campaign, Sir Frederic Rogers, Permanent Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, wrote back: &quot;I doubt whether the natives have ever attempted to devastate our settlements as we are devastating theirs. There is more destruction than fighting.&quot;

==McDonnell&#x27;s campaign==
In early 1866 military settlers began taking possession of land confiscated from Taranaki Māori to create new townships including Kakaramea, Te Pakakohi and Ngarauru. As surveyors moved on to the land, the Government recalled forces from Ōpōtiki on the east coast to form a camp at Patea to provide additional security. The force consisted of the Patea and Wanganui Rangers, Taranaki Military Settlers, Wanganui Yeomanry Cavalry and &quot;kupapa&quot; Māori and was commanded by Major Thomas McDonnell, an able but ruthless commander.

A series of attacks on small parties and convoys in June prompted retaliatory raids by McDonnell on local villages, including a bayonet raid on the Pokokaikai pā north of Hāwera on 1 August 1866, in which two men and a woman were killed. McDonnell had only days earlier communicated with the pā and extracted a strong signal that they intended remaining peaceful. A commission of inquiry held into the Pokaikai raid concluded the attack had been unnecessary and that McDonnell&#x27;s action in lulling the Māori into a state of security and then attacking them had been &quot;improper and unjust&quot;. A convoy was ambushed by Māori on 23 September in retaliation, with one soldier hacked to death with a tomahawk.

In September 1866 the field headquarters of the South Taranaki force was established at a redoubt built at Waihi (Normanby) and further raids were launched from it in September and October against pā and villages in the interior, including Te Pungarehu, on the western side of the Waingongoro River, Keteonetea, Te Popoia and Tirotiromoana. Villages were burned and crops destroyed in the raids and villagers were shot or taken prisoner. At one village where McDonnell carried out a surprise raid, he reported 21 dead &quot;and others could not be counted as they were buried in the burning ruins of the houses&quot;. When protests were raised over the brutality of the attacks, Premier Edward Stafford said such a mode of warfare &quot;may not accord with the war regulations, but it is one necessary for and suited to local circumstances&quot;.

With local Māori weakened and intimidated, fighting came to an end in November and an uneasy peace prevailed on the west coast until June 1868, with the outbreak of the third Taranaki War, generally known as Titokowaru&#x27;s War.

==21st century postscript==
The outcome of the armed conflict in Taranaki between 1860 and 1869 was a series of enforced confiscations of Taranaki tribal land from Māori blanketed as being in rebellion against the Government. Since 2001, the New Zealand Government has negotiated settlements with four of the eight Taranaki tribes, paying more than $101 million in compensation for the lands, and apologising for the actions of the government of that day.

<doc id="236128" wikidata="Q1065943" url="?curid=236128" title="Renaissance (band)">
<text>Renaissance are an English progressive rock band, best known for their 1978 UK top 10 hit &quot;Northern Lights&quot; and progressive rock classics like &quot;Carpet of the Sun&quot;, &quot;Mother Russia&quot;, and &quot;Ashes Are Burning&quot;. They developed a unique sound, combining a female lead vocal with a fusion of classical, folk, rock, and jazz influences. Characteristic elements of the Renaissance sound are Annie Haslam&#x27;s wide vocal range, prominent piano accompaniment, orchestral arrangements and vocal harmonies.

The band was founded by vocalist Keith Relf and drummer Jim McCarty, formerly of the Yardbirds; along with John Hawken, Louis Cennamo and Relf&#x27;s sister Jane. They intended to put &quot;something together with more of a classical influence&quot;. Renaissance released their self-titled debut album in 1969, but fell apart during the sessions for their follow-up, &quot;Illusion&quot; (1971). New musicians were brought in to complete the record, and Renaissance was kept active through a period of fluctuating personnel until none of the original lineup remained, although McCarty continued providing compositions for the band to record for several more years. By 1972, a stable lineup consisting of Annie Haslam, Michael Dunford, John Tout, Jon Camp, and Terry Sullivan solidified. Aside from McCarty, they were assisted with lyrics on many songs from Cornish poet Betty Thatcher-Newsinger. From 1972 to 1979 Renaissance released seven studio albums, toured extensively, and sold out three nights in a row at Carnegie Hall with Tony Cox conducting the New York Philharmonic. The band&#x27;s success was largely concentrated in the United States, where they built a cult following.

Renaissance struggled through the 1980s with personnel changes and two relatively unsuccessful studio albums, leading to disbandment in 1987. Two different offshoots of the band existed at the same time at one period in the mid-1990s. The band re-formed in 1998 to record &quot;Tuscany&quot;, which was eventually released in 2001; however, they broke up again the next year. A new iteration of Renaissance, led by Haslam and Dunford, debuted in 2009, and since then the band has continued to record and tour. Dunford died in November 2012. Later, Haslam stated that the band would continue touring. In 2013, they released the studio album &quot;Grandine il Vento&quot;, re-released the following year under the title &quot;Symphony of Light&quot;.

==Original incarnation (1969–1970)==
As the Yardbirds were transforming into the New Yardbirds (with Jimmy Page) in 1968 and then Led Zeppelin, the departing founding members of the Yardbirds, Keith Relf and Jim McCarty, formed an acoustic duo called Together.
 They released &quot;Henry&#x27;s Coming Home&quot; b/w &quot;Love Mum and Dad&quot; as a single on Columbia Records in November 1968 without chart success.

In January 1969, Relf and McCarty organized a new group devoted to experimentation with rock, folk, and classical forms. In his book &quot;Mountains Come Out of the Sky: An Illustrated History of Prog Rock&quot;, Will Romano quoted McCarty: &quot;Toward the end of the Yardbirds we wanted to do something a bit more poetic, if you like, not so heavy. A bit more folky... We had had enough of heavy rock.&quot; This quintet—Relf on guitar and vocals, McCarty on drums and vocals, plus bassist Louis Cennamo, pianist John Hawken, and Relf&#x27;s sister Jane as an additional vocalist—released a pair of albums on Elektra (US) and Island (UK-ILPS 9114), the first one, titled simply &quot;Renaissance&quot; (1969), being produced by fellow ex-Yardbird Paul Samwell-Smith.

The band had begun performing in May 1969, before recording had commenced for the debut LP, mostly in the UK, but with occasional forays abroad, including festivals in Belgium (Amougies, October 1969) and France (Operation 666 at the Olympia in January 1970, and Le Bourget in March 1970, both in Paris). In February 1970, they embarked on a North American tour, but that month-long trek proved only marginally successful. Because of their Yardbirds credentials, they found themselves paired with bands such as the Kinks and their new classically-oriented direction did not always go down well because audiences were expecting rock/blues-based material.

Beginning in the late spring of 1970 as touring began to grind on them, the original band gradually dissolved. Keith Relf and McCarty decided to quit performing, and Cennamo joined Colosseum. Hawken organized a new line-up to fulfill contractual obligations to Island Records and complete the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Illusion&quot; (1971) which had been left unfinished.

==Transition (1970–71)==
Apart from Jane Relf, the new band consisted mostly of former members of Hawken&#x27;s previous band, the Nashville Teens – guitarist Michael Dunford, bassist Neil Korner and singer Terry Crowe, plus drummer Terry Slade. This line-up recorded one track, &quot;Mr Pine&quot;, a Dunford composition, and played a few gigs during the summer of 1970. Meanwhile, a final recording session brought together the original line-up minus Hawken, with Don Shin sitting in on keyboards, and produced the album&#x27;s closing track &quot;Past Orbits of Dust&quot;. The now completed &quot;Illusion&quot; was released in Germany in 1971, although it was not released in the UK until 1976 (Island HELP 27). The album marked the beginning of Renaissance&#x27;s long-standing collaboration with poet Betty Thatcher-Newsinger as lyricist when she co-wrote two songs with Relf and McCarty.

The two remaining original members left in late 1970; Jane Relf was replaced by American folk singer Anne-Marie &quot;Binky&quot; Cullom, then John Hawken left to join Spooky Tooth and pianist John Tout replaced him. There is an extant video (released on the DVD &quot;Kings &amp; Queens&quot; in 2010) of that line-up performing five songs on a German TV program (Muzik-Kanal). The plan at the time was that Relf and McCarty would remain involved as non-performing members – Relf as a producer and McCarty as a songwriter. Both were present when singer Annie Haslam successfully auditioned in January 1971 to replace the departing Cullom (who would later marry drummer Terry Slade and retire from the music scene). While McCarty would go on to write songs for the new band, Relf&#x27;s involvement would be short-lived. Dunford soon emerged as a prolific composer, and continued the writing partnership with Thatcher, who would go on to write most of the lyrics for the band&#x27;s 1970s albums.

==Second incarnation (1971–1980)==
Sometime in 1971, new manager Miles Copeland III decided to re-organize the band, focusing on what he felt were Renaissance&#x27;s strong points – Haslam&#x27;s voice and Tout&#x27;s piano. Will Romano in &quot;Mountains Come Out of the Sky&quot; explained that &quot;unlike many of the artists to which they were compared Renaissance allowed the piano and female voice to come to the forefront&quot;. Until then Haslam had shared vocals with Terry Crowe, who was in effect the band&#x27;s chief vocalist. Crowe and Korner went, the former not replaced, the latter replaced by a succession of bass players, including John Wetton (later of King Crimson, U.K., and Asia), Frank Farrell (formerly of Supertramp) and Danny McCulloch (formerly of the Animals and a former bandmate of Dunford and Crowe in the Plebs), until the position settled with the inclusion of Jon Camp. It was also decided that Dunford would now concentrate on composing, and a new guitar player, Mick Parsons, was brought in for live work. In 1972, shortly before recording sessions for the new band&#x27;s debut LP, drummer Terence Sullivan joined after Slade&#x27;s initial replacement, Ginger Dixon, was deemed unsuitable following a European tour. Parsons died in a car accident and was replaced at short notice by Rob Hendry. The resulting line-up entered the studio having played only a dozen gigs together.

&quot;Prologue&quot; was released later in 1972 on EMI-Sovereign Records in the UK and on Capitol-Sovereign in North America. &quot;Prologue&quot;&#x27;s music was, except for two songs by McCarty, composed by Dunford, with all lyrics by Thatcher-Newsinger. Rock radio stations (particularly in the northeast US and Cleveland) gave the song &quot;Spare Some Love&quot; significant airplay for a few months after the album&#x27;s release, and fans of Yes and Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer in particular, took notice of the band. Francis Monkman, of the group Curved Air (another group managed by Copeland), was a guest on VCS3 synthesizer on the final track &quot;Rajah Khan&quot;.

Hendry left and was replaced for the &quot;Prologue&quot; tour by Peter Finberg, but Finberg was already committed to another band and so could not be a permanent replacement. This left Camp to play most of the guitar on their next album, &quot;Ashes are Burning&quot;, released in 1973. Though the band were trying to transition to a more acoustic sound, Andy Powell, of the group Wishbone Ash (yet another group managed by Copeland), was brought in for an electric guitar solo on the final track &quot;Ashes are Burning&quot;, which became the band&#x27;s anthem piece, often extended in live performances to over twenty minutes with a long bass solo and other instrumental workouts. The album became the band&#x27;s first to chart in the US, where it reached No. 171 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Shortly after the album&#x27;s release, Michael Dunford returned as (acoustic) guitarist, completing what most fans regard as the classic five-piece line-up, which would remain together through five studio albums. The band played their first US concerts during this period, enjoying success on the East Coast in particular, which soon resulted in a special orchestral concert at New York&#x27;s Academy of Music in May 1974. Soon Renaissance would choose to concentrate on the US market, as the UK press virtually ignored them.

===Joining BTM label===
The band left Sovereign Records and joined Miles Copeland&#x27;s new prog rock stable and label BTM (for British Talent Management). The label&#x27;s first release was &quot;Turn of the Cards&quot; in 1974. With a larger budget, the album went from folk-flavoured to a more dark, lush, orchestral rock sound. One of the album&#x27;s songs, &quot;Things I Don&#x27;t Understand&quot;, which clocked in at 9:30, was Jim McCarty&#x27;s last co-writing credit with the group (although it was actually in the band&#x27;s live repertoire for years). A lengthy tribute to Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, called &quot;Mother Russia&quot;, closed out the album, with lyrics inspired by his autobiographical novel, &quot;One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich&quot;. &quot;Turn of the Cards&quot; was first issued in the United States on Sire Records in August 1974, where it reached No. 94, some months before an official UK release. It remained in the Billboard 200 for 21 weeks. Although Renaissance&#x27;s fan base was relatively small, its following was heavily concentrated in the large cities of the northeast US. The album was eventually released in the UK in March 1975.

It was soon followed by &quot;Scheherazade and Other Stories&quot;, released on both sides of the Atlantic in September 1975. The album, whose second side was taken up with the epic tone-poem &quot;Song of Scheherazade&quot; based on stories from &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;, peaked at No. 48 in the United States. There is &quot;no musical connection to the well-known classical work &quot;Scheherazade&quot; by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov&quot;, but the track does have a recurring six-note motif that alludes to that work.

A double live album, &quot;Live at Carnegie Hall&quot;, followed in 1976. Despite criticisms that much of the album was little more than a note for note reproduction of highlights from their previous four studio albums, the album reached No. 55 in the US. Renaissance were the first British band to sell out three consecutive nights at Carnegie Hall. They were joined on stage by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. While introducing the song &quot;Ashes Are Burning&quot;, Haslam refers to it as the title track from the group&#x27;s &quot;second&quot; album, rather than their fourth, suggesting that the Haslam-led lineup by this point considered themselves a distinct band from Keith Relf&#x27;s incarnation of the group. (This point is further underscored by the band&#x27;s including an album discography in the gatefold of LP copies of &quot;Live at Carnegie Hall&quot;, which lists only the four albums from &quot;Prologue&quot; forward.)

&quot;Live at Carnegie Hall&quot;&#x27;s follow-up, &quot;Novella&quot;, saw more chart success in the US, peaking at No. 46 in 1977, although its UK release was delayed by yet another label change. Will Romano in &quot;Mountains Come Out of the Sky&quot; describes the band: &quot;Renaissance was at an all-time popularity high, finding themselves playing to sold-out audiences ... in the U.S., particularly in the northeastern part of the country, in Pennsylvania and New York.&quot;
===UK hit single===
Although commercial success was limited during this period, Renaissance scored a hit single in Britain with &quot;Northern Lights&quot;, which reached No. 10 during the summer of 1978. The single was taken from the album &quot;A Song for All Seasons&quot; (a No. 58 album in the US), and received significant airplay in the US on both AOR and on radio stations adapting to a new format known as &quot;soft rock&quot;, now known as adult contemporary. The band performed on a modestly successful tour of the US east of the Mississippi and drew significant crowds in State College, Pennsylvania and Cleveland in May and June 1979, promoting both &quot;A Song for All Seasons&quot; and a mix of old and new tracks. Additionally, the band gained exposure via US television; performing &quot;Carpet of the Sun&quot; in 1977 on &quot;The Midnight Special&quot;, and appearing as guests on the May 4, 1978, edition of the &quot;Mike Douglas Show&quot;, where they played &quot;Northern Lights&quot;.

Renaissance floundered following 1979&#x27;s &quot;Azure d&#x27;Or&quot;, as many fans could not relate to a largely synthesizer-oriented sound. As a result, the band&#x27;s fan base began to lose interest and the album only reached No. 125. Dunford and Camp assumed most of the band&#x27;s songwriting.

In the 1970s, Renaissance defined their work with folk rock and classical fusions. Their songs include quotations from and allusions to such composers as Jehan Alain, Johann Sebastian Bach, Frédéric Chopin, Claude Debussy, Remo Giazotto, Maurice Jarre, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, Sergei Prokofiev and Dmitri Shostakovich. Renaissance records, especially &quot;Ashes Are Burning&quot;, were frequently played on American progressive rock radio stations such as WNEW-FM, WHFS-FM, WMMR-FM, WJUL-FM, KSHE 95 and WVBR.

===Critical reaction to the &quot;classic line-up&quot;===
Reviewers were deeply divided in their reactions to the &quot;classic&quot; period of Renaissance, and their style of music. Some critics saw little value in their music, like Wayne King&#x27;s entry in &quot;The New Rolling Stone Record Guide&quot; describing the period 1974 to 1983: &quot;Their inability to compose songs that would allow for any fluidity or improvisation meant that Renaissance&#x27;s appeal, nonexistent in their native England and cultish at best in America, declined ... and the remainder of the Sire material matches this commercial decline with an artistic one. The comeback attempt on IRS ... was a ludicrous failure.&quot;
Progressive rock reviewers were much more supportive, such as Charles Snider in &quot;The Strawberry Bricks Guide to Progressive Rock&quot; evaluating the album &quot;Scheherazade and Other Stories&quot;, who describes:

&quot;Annie Haslam&#x27;s crystal clear five-octave voice high in the mix, supported by the virtuoso talents of pianist John Tout and Jon Camp&#x27;s distinctive Rickenbacker bass, and orchestral arrangements by Tony Cox.&quot;

==1980–1998==
After the &quot;Azure d&#x27;Or&quot; tour, Tout left the group for personal reasons, quickly followed by Sullivan. Subsequent albums &quot;Camera Camera&quot; (1981) and &quot;Time-Line&quot; (1983) brought Renaissance more into the contemporary synthpop and new wave genre, but neither garnered enough commercial interest to make a viable future for the band. &quot;Camera Camera&quot; was the band&#x27;s final album to chart in the US where it reached No. 196 in late 1981. In 1985 Camp left, and Haslam and Dunford led an acoustic version of the band and performed occasional shows (the last being in Georgetown, DC, until splitting up in August 1987).

In 1988, Sire issued a two-part compilation, &quot;Tales of 1001 Nights&quot;, focusing on the band&#x27;s 1972–79 period. In the 1990s most of their catalogue appeared on CD from reissue record labels such as Repertoire Records (Germany). In 2006 Repertoire issued remastered versions of &quot;Ashes are Burning&quot;, &quot;Turn of the Cards&quot; and &quot;Scheherezade and Other Stories&quot;.

In the mid-1990s, both Haslam (who had released a self-titled solo album in 1989) and Dunford (who had been working on a proposed musical based on the &quot;Scheherazade&quot; storyline) formed their own bands, each using the name Renaissance and releasing albums with different line-ups.

==Third incarnation==
Renaissance partially re-formed in 1998 around a nucleus of Haslam, Dunford and Sullivan, plus Tout and several new musicians, most notably Roy Wood and Mickey Simmonds, to record the CD &quot;Tuscany&quot;. In 1999, Haslam, Dunford and Simmonds played a one-off trio concert at London&#x27;s Astoria supporting Caravan.

In March 2001, following the delayed release of &quot;Tuscany&quot;, a full band tour was organised, with a line-up of Haslam, Dunford, Sullivan, Simmonds, Rave Tesar (keyboards) and David J. Keyes (bass and vocals), who played one London concert on 9 March (again at the Astoria) and three dates in Japan – Osaka on the 13th, Nagoya on the 14th and Tokyo on the 16th. The Tokyo concert was recorded and released as &quot;In the Land of the Rising Sun: Live in Japan 2001&quot;. (Tout, although in the audience at the Astoria, did not perform on this tour.) Haslam, who had become the band&#x27;s spokesperson, said that several factors made further touring and recording impractical. The band&#x27;s short third incarnation was soon over.

Terry Sullivan recorded an album called &quot;South of Winter&quot; in 2004, with a studio group he named Renaissant. It is evocative of Renaissance&#x27;s music, with lyrics by Thatcher-Newsinger and keyboard contributions by John Tout.

On 20 September 2008, John Tout made his first public appearance in the US in over 25 years, with Annie Haslam and the Jann Klose band, at the &quot;Sellersville Theatre 1894&quot; in Sellersville, Pennsylvania. In 2009, Tout suffered a heart attack.

In August 2009, Haslam announced that she and Dunford were commemorating the 40th anniversary of Renaissance with a re-formed band, called Renaissance 2009 (including no other members of the &quot;classic&quot; line-up, but with musicians from the 2001 incarnation of the band), and a concert tour.

A tour in Eastern North America and Japan was undertaken in 2010, together with a three-song EP release and a new official website. Renaissance headlined the sold-out final edition of the North East Art Rock Festival, entitled NEARfest Apocalypse, on 23 June 2012.

==Deaths of former members==
Keith Relf (born 22 March 1943), the band&#x27;s original lead singer, died on 12 May 1976, electrocuted while playing a poorly-earthed guitar. 

Betty Thatcher (born 16 February 1944), the band&#x27;s non-performing lyricist who wrote most of the lyrics for the band (mostly for the second &#x27;classic&#x27; lineup, but starting with the original Relf-led version), died on 15 August 2011.

Michael Dunford (born 8 July 1944) died from a cerebral hemorrhage on 20 November 2012 at his home in Surrey, England. A few weeks later, Haslam stated that the band would continue touring in the future, despite losing &quot;her guiding light&quot;. In February 2013, it was announced that Ryche Chlanda would be the guitarist on their 2013 tour.

John Tout (born 2 September 1944) died of lung failure on 1 May 2015 at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, London. The band paid tribute to their former keyboardist on their Facebook page, saying “He was an amazing musician, highly contributing to the unique sound of the band from 1970–1980.&quot;

David J. Keyes, the band&#x27;s latter-day bassist and vocalist, died in July 2019 from leiomyosarcoma.

John Hawken (born 9 May 1940), the band&#x27;s original keyboardist, died on May 15, 2024 at the age of 84.

Jon Camp (born 9 October 1949) died on December 13, 2024, at the age of 75. Annie Haslam paid tribute to the band&#x27;s former bassist on the RenaissanceTouring Facebook page, saying &quot;It is with great sadness that Jon Camp our incomparable bass player has passed away. Jon played a huge role in the band with his unique powerful yet emotional bass playing, occasional acoustic guitar parts, singing and of course songwriting. Terence Sullivan and I had a long conversation, both of us stunned by the news. We talked about the early days in the band, the fun we had together but more importantly creating unique, dramatic and the most beautiful music one could ever wish for. Then we had all the excitement of touring especially performing at Carnegie Hall and then at the Royal Albert Hall with all our parents having their own &#x27;boxes&#x27; , our hit single Northern Lights! many priceless memories with Jon.
His favourite song was Ashes are Burning which Terry and I have chosen as a tribute. AMAZING bass solo !!!!

Jon we will see you again somewhere out there and make more heavenly music.
Love, Annie Haslam and Terry&quot;

==&quot;Symphony of Light&quot;==
In April 2013 a new Renaissance album, &quot;Grandine il Vento&quot;, was released. It was dedicated on the inside sleeve to Dunford. This album was reissued as &quot;Symphony of Light&quot; in April 2014 with three bonus tracks.
&quot;Symphony of Light&quot; follows a similar path to the band&#x27;s early work with a combination of shorter songs, and longer, more progressive tracks such as the title track, and &quot;The Mystic and the Muse&quot;. The band were joined by well-known guest musicians Ian Anderson playing the flute on &quot;Cry to the World&quot;, and John Wetton performing a duet with Haslam on &quot;Blood Silver Like Moonlight&quot;. All the music was written by Dunford, except &quot;Renaissance Man&quot; (dedicated to Dunford) which was written by Rave Tesar. All the lyrics were written by Haslam, and the artwork featured a painting &#x27;Symphony of Light&#x27; also by Haslam.
Ralph Greco, Jr. in vintagerock.com observed that &quot;&quot;Symphony of Light&quot; thrives on lush production, evocative lyrics, excellent playing and that superlative voice that could only belong to Annie Haslam.&quot;

The current line-up is not as English as the band&#x27;s early period with five U.S. born members, and one English born member who lives in the U.S.

===Illusion===
Shortly prior to his death (May 1976), Keith Relf wanted to try to reform the original Renaissance. Since the name Renaissance was now firmly in the hands of the Haslam lineup, he chose the tentative band name &quot;Now&quot;. Jim McCarty was not involved at this point. After Relf&#x27;s death (May 1976), the surviving four formed a new band (along with two new musicians) and named it Illusion after Renaissance&#x27;s second album. Illusion released two albums for Island Records before splitting, while a third made up of unreleased demos appeared years later. The demos were recorded in 1979 but no label was interested in them which caused Illusion to break up. The original four reformed again for the production of &quot;Through the Fire&quot; which was released under the bandname of Renaissance-Illusion. There are two second albums entitled &quot;Illusion&quot;: the second album of the original Renaissance (1971); and the eponymous second album of their reunion band, Illusion (1978).

<text>Waukesha ( ) is the county seat of Waukesha County, Wisconsin, United States, along the Fox River. Its population was 71,158 at the 2020 census, making it the seventh-most populous city in Wisconsin. It is part of the Milwaukee metropolitan area. The city is adjacent to the Village of Waukesha.

==History==

The area that Waukesha now encompasses was first settled by European-Americans in 1834, with Morris D. Cutler as its first settler. When the first settlers arrived, there was nothing but dense virgin forest and wild prairie. The settlers laid out farms, constructed roads, erected government buildings and established post routes.

The original founders of Waukesha consisted entirely of settlers from New England, particularly Connecticut, rural Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine, as well some from upstate New York who were born to parents who had migrated to that region from New England shortly after the American Revolution. These people were &quot;Yankee&quot; settlers. In other words, they were descended from the English Puritans who settled New England in the 1600s. They were part of a wave of New England farmers who headed west into what was then the wilds of the Northwest Territory during the early 1800s. Most of them arrived as a result of the completion of the Erie Canal as well as the end of the Black Hawk War. When they arrived in what is now Waukesha County, the New Englanders laid out farms, constructed roads, erected government buildings and established post routes. They brought with them many of their Yankee New England values, such as a passion for education, establishing many schools as well as staunch support for abolitionism. They were mostly members of the Congregationalist Church though some were Episcopalian. Due to the second Great Awakening some of them had converted to Methodism and some had become Baptists before moving to what is now Waukesha County. Waukesha, like much of Wisconsin, would be culturally very continuous with early New England culture for most of its early history.

By 1846, the area was incorporated as the Town of Prairie Village (soon changed to Prairieville). On February 8, 1847, the town changed its name to &quot;Waukesha,&quot;. On January 10, 1852, the settled area once known as Prairieville was separated from the town of Waukesha, and incorporated as a village and in 1896, incorporated as a city. The first appointed mayor of the newly incorporated city of Waukesha was John Brehm, who served from January to April 1896. Welsh immigrants settling in Waukesha as early as the 1840s, and large numbers arrived in the late 1800s and early 1900s, when they were one of the largest ethnic groups in Waukesha. In the late 1800s a large number of Belgian families arrived in Waukesha as well. Around the same time there was also relatively large amounts of Serbian immigrants settling in Waukesha, many more of which arrived after the Yugoslav Wars much later in the 1990s.

===Name===
&quot;Waukesha&quot; is thought to be an Anglicization of the Ojibwe word , the plural of fox (), or the Potawatomi name . (sometimes written as or Wauke-tsha) was the leader of the local tribe at the time of the first European settlement of the area. This is confirmed by accounts of Increase A. Lapham, an early settler and historian of the region. According to Lapham, the Algonquian word for &quot;fox&quot; was . Cutler also told visitors about Wau-tsha, who was described as &quot;tall and athletic, proud in his bearing, dignified and friendly.&quot;

===&quot;Spring City&quot;===
Matthew Laflin, an early pioneer of Chicago, Illinois, provided the capital and enterprise that laid the foundation for Waukesha as a famous Wisconsin watering resort and was the proprietor of the grand resort, the Fountain Spring House. Waukesha was once known for its extremely clean and good-tasting spring water and was called a &quot;spa town.&quot; This earned the city the nicknames &quot;Spring City&quot; and &quot;Saratoga of the West.&quot;

According to author Kristine Adams Wendt, in 1868, Colonel Richard Dunbar, a sufferer of diabetes, chanced upon the medicinal properties of what he later named the Bethesda Spring while viewing a parcel of land recently purchased by his sister. Testimonials found in a Dunbar brochure of 1873 proclaimed the miraculous benefits.

Wendt reports that by 1872, &quot;area newspapers carried accounts of a community ill equipped to handle its new popularity among the suffering multitudes. The semi-weekly &quot;Wisconsin (Milwaukee)&quot; of July 31, 1872, reported &#x27;that fully 500 visitors are quartered in hotels and scattered in private families here, seeking benefit from the marvelous waters…&#x27;&quot;

The &quot;healing waters&quot; were so valued that a controversial attempt was made to build a pipeline between the city and Chicago so that they could be enjoyed by visitors to the 1893 Columbian Exposition. According to &quot;Time&quot; magazine, &quot;[t]he scheme had been conceived by one Charles Welsh who had been given the springs by his uncle, but after several miles of pipe were laid, it was discovered that the cost was too great.&quot;

Richard Warren Sears, founder of Sears and Roebuck, may have been attracted to Waukesha by the waters. In failing health, Sears retired from business in 1908 and, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;spent his time on his great farm near Waukesha.&quot; In 1914, Sears died in Waukesha of Bright&#x27;s disease, leaving an estate estimated at $20 million.

Over the years, the natural springs have been spoiled by pollution and a number have gone dry. Water drawn from an aquifer reached radium levels exceeding federal standards.

In 2013, Waukesha applied for permission to withdraw water from Lake Michigan. Because Waukesha is outside the lake&#x27;s basin, the 2008 Great Lakes Compact makes the city ineligible to withdraw water from the lake without approval from the governors of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. In June 2016, the governors approved Waukesha&#x27;s application. Construction of the supply and return pipelines for the Waukesha water diversion from Lake Michigan was completed in 2024. Typical water bills in the City are projected to increase by approximately 50% between 2023 and 2027, to fund the supply and return pipelines.

===Football history===
One of the most important &quot;firsts&quot; in American sports history occurred in Waukesha on September 5, 1906, when Carroll College (now Carroll University) hosted the football team from St. Louis University. SLU halfback Bradbury Robinson threw the first legal forward pass in football history in that game. The Carroll players and local fans were stunned. The visitors went on to win 22–0.

===Project Nike===
During the Cold War, Waukesha County was the site of three Nike Missile batteries, located in the city of Waukesha and nearby Muskego and Lannon. In the city of Waukesha, the U.S. Army and later the Wisconsin National Guard operated the command and control center from 1956 to 1970 at what is now Hillcrest Park, on Davidson Road. The missile pits existed near the corner of Cleveland Avenue and Hwy 164—first holding Ajax missiles with conventional warheads and later the nuclear equipped Hercules warhead. The Hercules provided a similar nuclear capability as that of the atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki in World War II. The Midwest Chapter of the Cold War Museum has promoted the preservation of the Hillcrest Park site as a local Cold War museum, honoring Cold War veterans and commemorating America&#x27;s longest and costliest conflict.

===Recent history===
On May 31, 2014, two 12-year-old Waukesha girls lured their friend into the woods and stabbed her 19 times. They did this to appease a fictional online character known as Slender Man. The victim survived the attack after being found by a cyclist. The two perpetrators were found not guilty by mental disease or defect, and were sentenced to long periods in mental health institutions.

On November 21, 2021, the driver of a red SUV by the name of Darrell E. Brooks Jr drove through the Waukesha Christmas Parade during its procession through downtown Waukesha late that afternoon, killing six people and injuring 62 others. During the trial he was removed from the courtroom several times and was later sentenced to six consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole, plus an additional 763 years and 3 months to be served consecutively.

<text>Activities of daily living (ADLs) is a term used in healthcare to refer to an individual&#x27;s daily self-care activities. Health professionals often use a person&#x27;s ability or inability to perform ADLs as a measure of their functional status. The concept of ADLs was originally proposed in the 1950s by Sidney Katz and his team at the Benjamin Rose Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio. Since then, numerous researchers have expanded on the concept of ADLs. For instance, many indexes that assess ADLs now incorporate measures of mobility.

In 1969, Lawton and Brody developed the concept of Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs) to capture the range of activities that support independent living. These are often utilized in caring for individuals with disabilities, injuries, and the elderly. Younger children often require help from adults to perform ADLs, as they have not yet developed the skills necessary to perform them independently. Aging and disabilities, affecting individuals across different age groups, can significantly alter a person&#x27;s daily life. Such changes must be carefully managed to maintain health and well-being.

Common activities of daily living (ADLs) include feeding oneself, bathing, dressing, grooming, working, homemaking, and managing personal hygiene after using the toilet. A number of national surveys have collected data on the ADL status of the U.S. population. Although basic definitions of ADLs are established, what specifically constitutes a particular ADL can vary for each individual. Cultural background and education level are among the factors that can influence a person&#x27;s perception of their functional abilities.

ADLs are categorized into basic self-care tasks (typically learned in infancy) or instrumental tasks generally learned throughout adolescence. A person who cannot perform essential ADLs may have a poorer quality of life or be unsafe in their current living conditions; therefore, they may require the help of other individuals and/or mechanical devices. Examples of mechanical devices to aid in ADLs include electric lifting chairs, bathtub transfer benches and ramps to replace stairs.

== Basic ==
Basic ADLs consist of self-care tasks that include:
* Bathing and showering
* Personal hygiene and grooming, which encompasses brushing, combing, and styling hair
* Dressing
* Toilet hygiene, which involves getting to the toilet, cleaning oneself, and getting back up
* Functional mobility, often referred to as &quot;transferring.&quot; This includes the ability to walk, get in and out of bed, and get into and out of a chair. The broader definition covers moving from one place to another while performing activities and is useful for people with varying physical abilities who can still move around independently.
* Self-feeding, which is limited to the act of eating itself, as opposed to assisted feeding

The Functional Independence Measure (FIM) is a tool developed in 1983 that uses a 0 to 7 scale to evaluate different ADLs based on the level of assistance required. A score of 7 indicates that the individual is independent, while a score of 0 signifies that the individual cannot perform the activity without assistance.

The specific breakdown of the scale is shown below:

7 - Complete Independence

6 - Modified Independence

5 - Supervision or Setup

4 - Minimal Assistance

3 - Moderate Assistance

2 - Maximal Assistance

1 - Total Assistance

0 - Activity Does Not Occur

== Instrumental ==
Instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) are not essential for basic day-to-day functioning, but they enable an individual to maintain a level of independence in a community.
* Cleaning and maintaining the house
* Managing money
* Moving within the community
* Preparing meals
* Shopping for groceries and other necessities
* Taking prescribed medications
* Using the telephone or other forms of communication

Occupational therapists often evaluate IADLs during patient assessments. The American Occupational Therapy Association identifies 12 types of IADLs, which may be performed individually or as co-occupations with others.
* Care of others (including selecting and supervising caregivers)
* Care of pets
* Child rearing
* Communication management
* Community mobility
* Financial management
* Health management and maintenance
* Home establishment and maintenance
* Meal preparation and cleanup
* Religious observances
* Safety procedures and emergency responses
* Shopping

== Therapy ==
Occupational therapists evaluate and use therapeutic interventions to rebuild the skills required to maintain, regain, or increase a person&#x27;s independence in all Activities of Daily Living may have diminished due to physical or mental health conditions, injuries, or age-related impairments.

Physical therapists employ exercises to help patients maintain and improve independence in ADLs. The exercise program is tailored to the patient&#x27;s specific deficits, which may include walking speed, strength, balance, and coordination. A slow walking speed has been linked to an increased risk of falls; thus, exercises that enhance walking speed are crucial for safer and more functional ambulation. After initiating an exercise program, it is important to maintain the routine. Otherwise, the benefits will be lost. For frail patients, regular exercise is vital in preserving functional independence and preventing the need for external assistance or placement in a long-term care facility.

== Assistance ==
Skills in assisting with ADLs are required in nursing and other professions, such as nursing assistants in hospitals, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and other long-term care settings. This includes assisting in patient mobility, such as repositioning an activity-intolerant patient in bed. Hygiene assistance may involve giving bed baths and helping with urinary and bowel elimination. Personal care assistants are required to adhere to established standards of care. Personal assistance is defined as wagered support of 20 or more hours a week for people with impairments. A 2008 review suggested that personal assistance may offer benefits to some elderly individuals and their informal caretakers. Further research is required to evaluate the efficiency of different personal assistance models and their overall costs.

==Caretaker requirements==
In community residential care settings, it is essential for personal assistants, doctors, and nurses to recognize that illness can alter a patient&#x27;s mental state, affecting their reactions to change and possibly leading to behaviors such as fussiness or capriciousness. Providing care with patience, tact, concentration, discipline, and compassion is crucial to building trust with patients, maintaining their confidence, and supporting the success of their treatment and recovery.

Because nursing care requires a great deal of attention and energy, nursing staff in some countries are often required to have national license as nurses, such as having passed the NCLEX. Nursing care is usually divided into general and specialized care. Particular difficulties arise when caring for the severely ill. A healthy workspace is an important factor. If caregivers are mistreated or burnt out, it can lead to residents being neglected and mistreated.

==Special care needs==
===Mobility===
Patients who are immobile should be repositioned at least every two hours to prevent the development of pressure ulcers, commonly known as bed sores. Repositioning hospitalized patients also offers additional benefits, such as a reduced risk of deep vein thrombosis, fewer pressure ulcers, and less functional decline. To protect the patient&#x27;s head from injury during repositioning, a pillow is commonly placed at the head of the bed. To move a bedridden patient up in bed, caregivers utilize either a friction-reducing sheet or a draw sheet.

=== Bathing ===
A bed bath involves using a bath blanket to cover the patient, ensuring that only the area being washed is exposed at any given time. This practice maintains privacy and keeps the patient warm. Typically, the eyes are cleansed first, using water without soap to prevent irritation. Each eye should be cleaned from the inner corner near the nose outward, to avoid transferring debris to the tear duct. A clean section of the cloth is used, or the cloth is rinsed before cleaning the second eye, to prevent the spreading of any organisms. After washing, each area is dried before moving on to the next.

Perineal care follows a specific protocol to minimize the transfer of microorganisms. The perineum should be washed from the least contaminated area to the most contaminated area. In females, this involves spreading the labia and washing from the pubic area toward the anal area, never in reverse. For males, the tip of the penis is cleansed first, moving away from the urethral opening (meatus). If the male is uncircumcised, the foreskin is gently retracted, washed, and then promptly returned to its original position to prevent restricting circulation. For children, the foreskin is not retracted to avoid injury.

=== Toileting ===
A bedpan is used for bed-bound patients for bowel elimination as well as urinary elimination for females. The head of the bed is raised to assist in voiding or defecating.

=== Dressing ===
For individuals with one side weaker than the other (e.g., due to a stroke), it is recommended to dress the weaker side first using the stronger arm. Conversely, when undressing, the stronger side should be undressed first.

When making an occupied bed, for instance for patients who cannot or have difficulty getting out of bed, the bed is made one side at a time. However, for patients for whom rolling to the side is contraindicated, such as those recovering from hip replacement surgery, the process is modified. These patients are assisted into a sitting position while the caregiver makes the top half of the bed. Once completed, the patient is then helped to lie back while the bottom half of the bed is made.

===Feeding===
To maintain self-esteem, patients are involved as much as possible in their care. Their preferences for the order of consuming their meal items are respected. Condiments are provided, and food is prepared according to each patient&#x27;s preferences. Adequate liquid is supplied with the meal. Necessary aids such as dentures, hearing aids, and glasses are put in place before mealtime. Oral hygiene is important after eating and includes brushing teeth, cleaning dentures, and using mouthwash. For those with dysphagia, patients must be placed on aspiration precautions. The feeding rate and bite sizes are tailored to each patient&#x27;s tolerance. Dietary modifications, as recommended by a nutrition consultation, can include chopping, mincing, pureeing, or adding thickeners to make swallowing easier. For patients with visual impairments, a clock face analogy is commonly used to describe the position of meal items. When not contraindicated by dysphagia, straws are provided to help prevent spills.

=== Suicide precautions ===
For individuals on suicide watch, meals are provided in plastic or paper containers accompanied by plastic utensils (excluding knives), and the use of sharp objects is permitted only under continuous staff supervision.

===Bed making===
A fitted sheet is placed over the mattress of a hospital bed. Often, a draw sheet (also known as a lift sheet) is laid on top of the fitted sheet at the center, where it will lie beneath the patient&#x27;s midsection. The draw sheet is commonly used to assist in lifting or repositioning the patient. Sheets positioned under the patient are securely tucked in to prevent the formation of wrinkles, which can contribute to skin breakdown. A top sheet and a blanket are then placed over the bed, with the corners neatly mitered.

===Wound care===
Wound dressings can be categorized into several types, including hydrocolloid, hydrogel, alginate, collagen, foam, transparent, and cloth dressings.

== Evaluation ==
Several evaluation tools are available to assess Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL), including the Katz ADL scale, the Older Americans Resources and Services (OARS) ADL/IADL scale, the Lawton IADL scale, and the Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale.

In the domain of disability, measures have been developed to capture functional recovery in performing basic activities of daily living. Amongst them, some measures like the Functional Independence Measure are designed for assessment across a wide range of disabilities. Others like the Spinal Cord Independence Measure are designed to evaluate participants in a specific type of disability.

Most models of health care service use ADL evaluations in their practice, including the medical (or institutional) models, such as the Roper–Logan–Tierney model of nursing, and the resident-centered models, such as the Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE).

Pervasive computing technology was considered to determine the wellness of the elderly living independently in their homes. The framework of the intelligent system consists of monitoring important daily activities through the observation of everyday object usage. The improved wellness indices helped in reducing false warnings related to the daily activities of elderly living.

=== Research ===
ADL evaluations are increasingly used in epidemiological studies as a measure of health in later life that does not focus exclusively on specific ailments. Unlike studies investigating specific disease outcomes, research employing ADL assessments is sensitive to a wider range of health effects, including those with lower levels of impact. ADL is measured on a continuous scale, which simplifies the research process.

Sidney Katz conducted a study of 64 hip fracture patients over an 18-month period, collecting comprehensive data on their treatments, progression, and outcomes. Analysis of the data revealed that the patients perceived as most independent were able to perform a range of basic activities, from the more complex task of bathing to the simpler one of feeding themselves. Based on these findings, Katz developed a scale to evaluate a patient&#x27;s capacity for living. This scale was first published in the 1963 &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot; and has been cited over 1,000 times since its publication.

Although the scale offers a standardized measure of psychological and biological function, the process of arriving at this assumption has been criticized. Specifically, Porter has argued for a phenomenological approach noting that:

Porter emphasizes the possible disease-specific nature of ADLs (being derived from hip-fracture patients), the need for an objective definition of ADLs, and the possible value of adding additional functional measures.

A systematic review examined the effectiveness of programmes designed to teach activities of daily living skills, specifically to individuals with schizophrenia:

<doc id="236141" wikidata="Q190651" url="?curid=236141" title="Jerzy Dudek">
<text>Jerzy Henryk Dudek (born 23 March 1973) is a Polish former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper.

After beginning his career in his home country, he went on to have successful spells in the Netherlands and England, winning the Champions League with Liverpool in 2005 and appearing in 186 official matches for the club over six seasons. He also spent four years at Real Madrid.
Dudek played 60 times for Poland – the second most-capped player in his position for several years – representing the nation at the 2002 World Cup.

==Club career==
===Early years===
Born in Rybnik, Dudek began playing football at 12 for Górnik Knurów. Six years later, he made his senior debut with the renamed Concordia in the third division, where he set a record of 416 minutes without conceding a goal.

Dudek only played one season in the Ekstraklasa, appearing in roughly half of the matches for Sokół Tychy as the club finished in mid-table, making his first appearance in the competition against Legia Warsaw.

===Feyenoord===
Dudek left his country in 1996 at age 23, joining Feyenoord, but had to wait a year before he made his debut, proceeding to appear in all Eredivisie matches the following four campaigns. He won the national championship in 1998–99 along with the subsequent edition of the Johan Cruyff Shield, after a 3–2 win over Ajax.

Dudek won the Dutch Golden Shoe award in 2000, becoming the first foreign player to achieve this. Also that year, he was voted Polish Footballer of the Year.

On 26 August 2001, Dudek made his final appearance for the Rotterdam side, a 2–1 home loss also against Ajax.

===Liverpool===

Dudek and fellow goalkeeper Chris Kirkland joined Liverpool in late August 2001. Despite the latter being the more expensive of the two, the former immediately replaced incumbent goalkeeper Sander Westerveld as coach Gérard Houllier&#x27;s first-choice and, following a first season where his clean sheets and fine performances helped the club finish second in the Premier League behind double-winners Arsenal, he was nominated alongside Oliver Kahn and Gianluigi Buffon for the UEFA Goalkeeper of the Year award.

The following campaign, Dudek rebounded from a series of errors in the league to win the League Cup with a player of the match performance against Manchester United in the final. Pope John Paul II, who was a goalkeeper in his youth, met personally with him in 2004, saying that he was his fan and followed Liverpool whenever they played; the player presented the Pope with a souvenir goalkeeper shirt, and would later dedicate Liverpool&#x27;s UEFA Champions League success to the late pontiff.
Dudek was a catalyst in Liverpool&#x27;s 2005 Champions League victorious run, performing a double save against AC Milan&#x27;s Andriy Shevchenko at the end of extra time in the final, after the team had rallied from a 3–0 deficit to tie the match 3–3. He saved from Andrea Pirlo and Shevchenko in the ensuing penalty shootout, won 3–2, where he attempted to distract the opposing players with the &quot;spaghetti legs&quot; tactic that was used by former Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar in the 1984 European Cup final. Being European Cup winners for the fifth time, the English kept the trophy and received a multiple-winner badge, and he became the third Polish footballer after Zbigniew Boniek (with Juventus) and fellow goalkeeper Józef Młynarczyk (Porto) to win the Champions League – he also received his second Goalkeeper of the Year nomination. A group of Liverpool fans, &quot;The Trophy Boyz&quot;, recorded a novelty tribute single called &quot;Du the Dudek&quot;, which became a top-40 hit in the United Kingdom; profits from the sale of the track went to the family of Michael Shields, a club supporter who was imprisoned in Bulgaria in controversial circumstances following the match.

Dudek lost his starting position to new acquisition Pepe Reina in 2005–06, following an arm injury, only totalling 12 appearances for the &quot;Reds&quot; in the following two seasons (eight in the league). Despite courting controversy by accusing manager Rafael Benítez of &quot;treating him like a slave&quot;, he insisted he had no ill feelings towards the club or anyone associated with it and only wanted to leave after failing to make Poland&#x27;s World Cup squad, but still stayed on for another year at the manager&#x27;s request. He was voted by fans at number 36 in the list of &quot;100 Players Who Shook the Kop&quot;.

In a poll conducted by UEFA.com, Dudek&#x27;s double save from Shevchenko was voted the greatest Champions League moment of all time, ahead of Zinedine Zidane&#x27;s left-footed volley against Bayer Leverkusen in the 2002 final and Ole Gunnar Solskjær&#x27;s injury-time winner against Bayern Munich in 1999 for Manchester United.

===Real Madrid===

The 34-year-old Dudek moved to Real Madrid for 2007–08, but only played in two La Liga games in four years due to the presence of Iker Casillas. Nevertheless, his attitude and work ethic earned praise from his fans, teammates, coaching staff and several Spanish journalists; his man of the match performance in his debut, in the penultimate match of the season against Real Zaragoza, was hailed in the Spanish press, despite not being enough to earn selection for Poland&#x27;s squad for UEFA Euro 2008.

In Juande Ramos&#x27; first match as Madrid manager, in December 2008, Dudek was handed a rare start in a 3–0 home defeat of Zenit Saint Petersburg as the club was already qualified from the Champions League group stages. In a match where Madrid&#x27;s attacking play made headlines, he made several fine saves and exuded an air of calm solidity and confidence, particularly on crosses, earning a clean sheet in the process. This performance earned glowing praise from the manager, who highlighted the goalkeeper&#x27;s qualities and referred to him as a &quot;magnificent player&quot;; it would be his last appearance of the campaign, which also saw a 5–0 aggregate loss against former club Liverpool in the round of 16.

Speculation was rife about Dudek&#x27;s dissatisfaction with life at Real Madrid, and an end-of-season return to Feyenoord where he would work more closely with head coach Leo Beenhakker – his former boss at Feyenoord and also at the helm of the Poland national team – was a possibility. However, no move materialised, and with former teammate Jordi Codina leaving to join Getafe, the 36-year-old accepted a new one-year deal extension, while also speaking about his contentment.

On 27 October 2009, Dudek saw his first action of the campaign in the first round of the Copa del Rey, in a 4–0 shock loss to minnows Alcorcón from Segunda División B, with the goalkeeper being one of the few on the losing end to perform well. He also appeared in the second leg, an insufficient 1–0 home win.

On 10 April 2010, following news of the air crash which claimed the lives of 96 Polish people – including President of Poland Lech Kaczyński and several top government officials – the players of both Real Madrid and Barcelona agreed, at Dudek&#x27;s request, to observe a minute&#x27;s silence for the evening&#x27;s &quot;El Clásico&quot; match. His teammates also agreed to wear black armbands for the match.

On 15 July 2010, Dudek accepted another one-year contract to stay with Real Madrid. As manager José Mourinho was appointed, he worked with his fourth coach in as many seasons; on 30 November, he was fined €5,000 for his role in the controversial sendings-off of teammates Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos in the Champions League group stage match against Ajax.

Dudek made his first start of 2010–11 in the same competition, against Auxerre on 8 December. However, after making two impressive saves, he saw his action terminated after sustaining a jaw injury in a clash with opposing forward Roy Contout just before half-time. He was successfully fitted with an intermaxillary fixation device and was out of action for six weeks before returning to training, and was also praised for his performance by stand-in manager Aitor Karanka.

Dudek was named as a substitute in the 2010–11 Spanish Cup final, a 1–0 victory over Barcelona. He made his final appearance for &quot;the Merengues&quot; on 21 May 2011 in an 8–1 home rout of Almería, and was substituted in the 77th minute to a guard of honour from his Real Madrid teammates.

==International career==

Dudek received his first call-up for Poland in 1996 as an unused substitute during an exhibition game against Russia in Moscow. He won his first cap in February 1998 in another friendly with Israel, and also captained the team once in a friendly against Estonia.

Dudek played nine of the national team&#x27;s ten 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifiers as they finished top of their group, and started in the finals in Japan and South Korea, where they exited at the group stage. He also played in seven of his country&#x27;s ten qualifying matches for the 2006 World Cup, but owing to a lack of appearances at club level during the season, he was dropped from the starting line-up in favour of Artur Boruc and left off the final squad as a result.

Dudek&#x27;s omission from the World Cup squad was greeted with shock among Polish fans and media alike, with one newspaper&#x27;s headline reading: &quot;Has Janas [national team manager] gone mad?!&quot; During a warm-up match against Colombia, where both Boruc and Tomasz Kuszczak were at fault for each of the goals in a 1–2 home defeat, the angered Polish fans started to chant Dudek&#x27;s name as a reminder of what they perceived as a mistake by Janas to drop him. It is worth noting that the goal Kuszczak conceded, which prompted the chants, was directly from a goal-kick from the opposing goalkeeper Neco Martínez.

Following the World Cup, Dudek returned to the national team to play in two fixtures under new boss Beenhakker, a 2–0 friendly defeat in Denmark and a 1–3 UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying loss against Finland at home, before being dropped yet again. Despite a period of three years &quot;in the wilderness&quot;, he always believed that he would return to the national team and, in September 2009, he was called up to the squad for the 2010 World Cup qualifiers against the Czech Republic and Slovakia by interim manager Stefan Majewski; after being on the bench for the first match in Prague, which saw Poland&#x27;s slim World Cup hopes shattered, he won his 59th cap against the latter on 14 October in the nation&#x27;s final competitive game before Euro 2012. In a match which was played in heavy snow and in front of a near-empty Stadion Śląski in Chorzów, he was denied a clean sheet by an own goal from Seweryn Gancarczyk in a 0–1 defeat.

Almost four years later, Dudek played his farewell game on 4 June 2013 against Liechtenstein, becoming the oldest ever player to appear for the Poland national team at the age of 40 years and 73 days. He captained the team, wore number 60 on his shirt and came off just before half-time.

==Ambassadorship==
Dudek&#x27;s status as an icon in Poland played an important role in securing the status of joint host nation for the Euro 2012 for his country. Along with his Champions League opponent Shevchenko of Ukraine, he was a part of the joint delegation and was involved in a presentation with the striker.

Dudek was also named as the ambassador for the 2015 UEFA Europa League Final in Warsaw.

==Personal life==
Dudek and his wife, Mirella, had one son, Aleksander, and two daughters, Victoria and Natalia. His father was a miner, and he spoke of himself having taken training to follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps before his opportunity to play football came along. His younger brother, Dariusz, was also a footballer, and played mainly for Odra Wodzisław.

Dudek refused to wear the number 13 shirt for two seasons after arriving at Real Madrid, stating that Polish goalkeepers generally do not use 13; the numbers 1, 12 and 22 are traditionally used. He therefore took number 25 as it was the next best thing while Codina wore 13 until his departure. 

Dudek was number 13 from 2009 to 2010 under Manuel Pellegrini, but was handed back the 25 shirt under Mourinho. In his first season at Liverpool, he wore 12 because Westerveld was still in possession of the 1 squad number.

In 2005, Dudek received the title of the honourable citizen of Knurów, during a charity match called &quot;Jerzy Dudek &amp; Friends.&quot; He also made his Polish television debut as an analyst for the 2005 UEFA Super Cup final between Liverpool and CSKA Moscow, which he missed due to injury. In 2006, while on summer vacation in Poland, his home on the Wirral Peninsula was burgled and several valuables and treasured football memorabilia were stolen. Thanks to the efforts of the Merseyside Police Department, his collection of shirts, medals and awards was recovered along with most of his valuables.

Dudek also stated he would like to start a football academy in Poland with his brother after retiring from football. He settled with his family in Kraków.

==Motor racing career==
In 2014, Dudek completed his first full season in the Volkswagen Castrol Cup, a racing championship held at circuits around Eastern Europe during the summer months.

<text>Lifeguard (Heather Cameron) is a character, a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Chris Claremont and artist Salvador Larroca, the character first appeared in &quot;X-Treme X-Men&quot; #6 (December 2001). She is primarily associated with the X-Men.

Lifeguard is a mutant, gaining whatever superhuman abilities are needed in a life-threatening situation. She and her brother Slipstream were briefly members of the segment of X-Men featured in the series &quot;X-Treme X-Men.&quot;

==Fictional character biography==
===&quot;X-Treme X-Men&quot;===
Heather and Davis Cameron were a lifeguard and a surfer, respectively, living in Surfers Paradise in Australia. Unbeknownst to them, their father is an underworld crime lord known as Viceroy, and upon his death they were attacked. Together with Storm and Neal Shaara (the new Thunderbird), they managed to defeat their attackers. Heather discovered she was a mutant with the power to manifest whatever was necessary to save the life of someone in danger around her, including her own. Her power enabled her to manifest wings, golden armor, the ability to breathe underwater, and many other less noticeable adaptations. Heather soon joined the splinter team of X-Men, and formed a romance with Thunderbird.

During a mission to infiltrate the ship of the intergalactic warlord, Khan, Heather&#x27;s appearance changes to resemble the Shi&#x27;ar, leading Jean Grey to believe that she is a Shi&#x27;ar hybrid. Her brother, unable to see past her new alien appearance, leaves the team. Lifeguard and Thunderbird travel in search of him.

===The Xavier Institute===
Months later, Lifeguard and Thunderbird return to the X-Men, having been unsuccessful in locating Slipstream. Together with Thunderbird, she joined the X-Corporation. However this only lasted weeks, as there was a synchronized attack on several of the X-Corporation offices after the catastrophic events of M-Day, leading Cyclops to call for the disbanding of all offices.

Heather is one of a handful of mutants to have retained her powers in the wake of House of M. Still involved with Thunderbird III, she was not active in any X-Men roster, though the &quot;198 Files&quot; verified her location as residing at the Xavier Institute for Higher Learning.

===Utopia===
Heather later resurfaces after the events of Schism as a member of Cyclops&#x27; street team with Boom Boom and Dazzler in San Francisco and Utopia.

===Krakoa===
Heather appears in a groupshot of the Green Lagoon on Krakoa. She appears to be talking to Jamie Madrox and has developed a mermaid-like tail to dip in the water.

==Powers and abilities==
Heather&#x27;s mutant power allows her body to sense and react to any threat by transforming or manifesting a power to deal with the situation (similar to that of the X-Men&#x27;s Darwin). In all of her appearances, she has only shown to use this ability while defending herself along others. It is unknown if she is able to use this ability for her own protection. She has a moderate level of control over this power and has sometimes been able to trigger it at will, although she has not displayed any control over the transformations or powers she manifests. Heather has mostly manifested physical changes such as extra arms, armored skin, wings, and a mermaid tail. In her first appearance, she also demonstrated hydrokinesis. The full extent of Lifeguard&#x27;s abilities have yet to be revealed.

After her Shi&#x27;ar abilities manifest, Heather permanently gains golden skin, wings, and claws.

In addition to her superhuman powers, Heather is a trained lifeguard and skilled swimmer.

==Other versions==
===&quot;X-Men: The End&quot;===
Lifeguard appears in &quot;X-Men: The End&quot; as a protector of Aliyah Bishop in the Shi&#x27;ar Imperium. 

==Reception==

=== Critical reception ===
Lukas Shayo of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; stated, &quot;A mutant with the power to save lives, the aptly named Lifeguard can develop any ability necessary to save any life, be it her own or another&#x27;s. If that means turning into metal, growing wings, or shapeshifting, Lifeguard will develop that power and subsequently save a life. As what essentially amounts to a stronger version of Darwin, Lifeguard doesn&#x27;t really get the reputation she deserves. No mutant can ever surpass her ability to save lives, as their mutations are often tailored to other specific niches. With no upper limit to determine how she can shift, Lifeguard deserves her place among the Omega-levels.&quot;

=== Accolades ===

* In 2015, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked Lifeguard 84th in their &quot;Let&#x27;s rank every X-Man ever&quot; list.

<doc id="236158" wikidata="Q4943804" url="?curid=236158" title="Booster pack">
<text>In collectible card games, digital collectible card games and collectible miniature wargames, a booster pack is a sealed package of cards or figurines, designed to add to a player&#x27;s collection. A box of multiple booster packs is referred to as a booster box.

Booster packs contain a small number of randomly assorted items (8–15 for cards; 3–8 for figurines). Booster packs are the smaller, cheaper counterparts of starter decks, though many expansion sets are sold only as booster packs. While booster packs are cheaper than starter packs, the &quot;price per item&quot; is typically higher. Booster packs are generally priced to serve as good impulse purchases, with prices comparable to a comic book and somewhat lower than those of most magazines, paperback books, and similar items.

In many games, there is a fixed distribution based on rarity, while others use truly random assortments. When the distribution is based on rarity, booster packs usually contain one or two rares, depending on the game, while the remainder are of lesser rarity.

==Examples of sizes==

In the &quot;&quot; expansions Legends, The Dark, Arabian Nights, Fallen Empires, and Antiquities, cards were sold in 8 card booster packs. In Limited Edition Alpha and Limited Edition Beta, as well as from Unlimited Edition onward, the cards were sold in 15 cards per booster: 11 commons, 1 rare, and 3 uncommons; Core Set boosters contain a basic land as one of the commons. Starting with the Alara block, booster packs for both Core Sets and expansions began to contain 1 land, 10 commons, 3 uncommons, either 1 rare (7/8 chance) or 1 mythic rare (1/8 chance), and either a tip card (which explains the new rules in the set, such as exalted in the Alara Block or Infect in the Scars of Mirrodin Block) or a token (which is of a type produced by a card in the set). Roughly one in every four booster packs contain a foil card, which can be of any rarity, including basic land.

The &quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game&quot; originally had 11 cards per booster pack – 1 rare card, 3 uncommons, and 7 commons. With the release of the E-Series, it became 9 cards per booster – 5 commons, 2 uncommons, 1 reverse holo, and 1 rare. This became 10 cards after the release of Diamond and Pearl, with 3 uncommons instead of 2. Starting in the Sun &amp; Moon expansion, there is also a basic Energy card in every booster pack. As of the Scarlet &amp; Violet expansion, there are up to 2 reverse holo cards.

&quot;HeroClix&quot; uses 5 figure boosters. A booster contains 2 or 3 commons, 1 or 2 uncommons, and 1 rare, but super-rare or chase figures may replace one of the other figures in the box (which is replaced varies based on the set). Prior to the &quot;Avengers&quot; set, HeroClix typically used 4 figure boosters with a much more complicated six-tier rarity scheme, with a few exceptions such as the &quot;Fantastic Forces&quot; set, which had three figures boosters because of the larger size of many of the pieces, and the 1 or 2 figure boosters formerly marketed at retail stores.

==Starter deck==
A starter deck (also known as an intro deck, battle box, and other terms) is a box of cards or figurines designed as an entry point into a CCG or collectible miniature game for beginners. Starter decks are typically pre-constructed though they can also be random. Non-random cards may sometimes be referred to as &quot;fixed&quot; cards. Typically they are intended as a launching point, with an encouragement for further purchases to modify and improve these decks or sets.

Starter decks may contain any number of items, including , playmats, counters, dice, storage boxes, and common cards such as &quot;basic land&quot; in &quot;Magic: The Gathering&quot;, and other items. Some starter decks are meant for two players, so that a single set can be used instead of each player buying one separately.

<text>Dictyostelium is a genus of single- and multi-celled eukaryotic, phagotrophic bacterivores. Though they are Protista and in no way fungal, they traditionally are known as &quot;slime molds&quot;. They are present in most terrestrial ecosystems as a normal and often abundant component of the soil microflora, and play an important role in the maintenance of balanced bacterial populations in soils.

The genus &quot;Dictyostelium&quot; is in the order Dictyosteliida, the so-called cellular slime molds or social amoebae. In turn the order is in the infraphylum Mycetozoa. Members of the order are of great theoretical interest in biology because they have aspects of both unicellularity and multicellularity. The individual cells in their independent phase are common on organic detritus or in damp soils and caves. In this phase they are amoebae. Typically, the amoebal cells grow separately and wander independently, feeding mainly on bacteria. However, they interact to form multi-cellular structures following starvation. Groups of up to about 100,000 cells signal each other by releasing chemoattractants such as cyclic AMP (cAMP) or glorin. They then coalesce by chemotaxis to form an aggregate that becomes surrounded by an extracellular matrix. The aggregate forms a fruiting body, with cells differentiating individually into different components of the final structure. In some species, the whole aggregate may move collectively – forming a structure known as a grex or &quot;slug&quot; – before finally forming a fruiting body. Basic processes of development such as differential cell sorting, pattern formation, stimulus-induced gene expression, and cell-type regulation are common to &quot;Dictyostelium&quot; and metazoans. For further detail see family Dictyostelid.

==Discovery==
The cellular slime mold was formerly considered to be fungi following their discovery in 1869 by Brefeld. Although they resemble fungi in some respects, they have been included in the kingdom Protista. Individual cells resemble small amoebae in their movement and feeding, and so are referred to as myxamoebae. &quot;D. discoideum&quot; is the most studied of the genus.

==Traits==
Most of its life, this haploid social amoeba undergoes a vegetative cycle, preying upon bacteria in the soil, and periodically dividing mitotically. When food is scarce, either the sexual cycle or the social cycle begins. Under the social cycle, amoebae aggregate in response to cAMP by the thousands, and form a motile slug, which moves towards light. Ultimately the slug forms a fruiting body in which about 20% of the cells die to lift the remaining cells up to a better place for sporulation and dispersal.

When starved for their bacterial food supply and exposed to dark, moist conditions, heterothallic or homothallic strains can undergo sexual development that results in the formation of a diploid zygote. Heterothallic mating has been best studied in &quot;D. discoideum&quot; and homothallic mating has been best studied in &quot;Dictyostelium mucoroides&quot; (strain DM7). In the heterothallic sexual cycle, amoebae aggregate in response to cAMP and sex pheromones, and two cells of opposite mating types fuse, and then begin consuming the other attracted cells. Before they are consumed, some of the prey cells form a cellulose wall around the entire group. When cannibalism is complete, the giant diploid cell is a hardy macrocyst which eventually undergoes recombination and meiosis, and hatches hundreds of recombinants. In &quot;D. mucoroides&quot; (DM7) homothallic mating, cells are directed towards sexual development by ethylene. Scientists also found the collective cell migration could occur without the presence of cAMP oscillations at multicellular stages, and novel models have been proposed to interpret this interesting phenomenon.

== Social characteristics ==
Professor John Tyler Bonner (1920–2019) spent a lifetime researching the slime molds and created a number of fascinating films in the 1940s to show the life cycle; he mostly studied &quot;D. discoideum&quot;. In the videos, intelligence appears to be observed as the single cells, after separation, regroup into a cellular mass. The time-lapse film captivated audiences; indeed, Bonner when giving conferences stated that the film &quot;always stole the show&quot;. The video is available on YouTube.

When the organisms congregate, the mass is made of genetically distinct cells. Through natural selection, it is determined which of the organisms&#x27; genetic information will be present in future generations. The conflict is evidenced by unequal representations of two genetically different clones in spores of a chimera, the reduction of functionality seen in migrating chimeras, and a differentiation inducing factor (DIF) system, akin to poison, that appears to be made of cells forcing others to cease output of genetic information.

<text>Union Royale Belge des Sociétés de Football Association ASBL v Jean-Marc Bosman (1995) C-415/93 (known as the Bosman ruling) is a 1995 European Court of Justice decision concerning freedom of movement for workers, freedom of association, and direct effect of article 39 (now article 45 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union) of the Treaty of Rome. 

The case was an important decision on the free movement of labour and had a profound effect on the transfers of footballers—and by extension players of other professional sports—within the European Union (EU).

The decision banned restrictions on foreign EU players within national leagues and allowed players in the EU to move to another club at the end of a contract without a transfer fee being paid.

The ruling was made in a consolidation of three separate legal cases, all involving Belgian player Jean-Marc Bosman:
* &quot;Belgian Football Association v Jean-Marc Bosman&quot;
* &quot;R.F.C. de Liège v Jean-Marc Bosman and others&quot;
* &quot;UEFA v Jean-Marc Bosman&quot;

==Facts==
Jean-Marc Bosman was a player for RFC Liège in the Belgian First Division whose contract had expired in 1990. He wanted to change teams and move to Dunkerque, a French club. However, Dunkerque refused to meet his Belgian club&#x27;s transfer fee demand, so Liège refused to release Bosman.

In the meantime, Bosman&#x27;s wages were reduced by 70% as he was no longer a first-team player. He took his case to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg and sued for restraint of trade, citing FIFA&#x27;s rules regarding football, specifically Article 17.

==Judgment==
On 15 December 1995, the court ruled the system, as it was constituted, placed a restriction on the free movement of workers and was prohibited by Article 39(1) of the EC Treaty (now Article 45 (1) of the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union). Bosman and all other EU footballers were given the right to a free transfer at the expiration of their contracts, provided that they transfer from a club within one EU association to a club within another EU association.

==Significance to football==
Prior to the Bosman ruling, professional clubs in some parts of Europe (but not, for example, in Spain and France) were able to prevent players from joining a club in another country even if their contracts had expired. In the United Kingdom, Transfer Tribunals had been in place since 1981 to resolve disputes over fees between clubs when transferring players at the end of their contracts. The Bosman ruling meant that players could move to a new club at the end of their contract without their old club receiving a fee. Players can now agree a pre-contract with another club for a free transfer if the players&#x27; contract with their existing club has six months or less remaining.

The Bosman ruling also prohibited domestic football leagues in EU member states, and also UEFA, from imposing quotas on foreign players to the extent that they discriminated against nationals of EU states. At that time, many leagues placed quotas restricting the number of foreign nationals allowed on member teams. Also, UEFA had a rule that prohibited teams in its competitions, namely the Champions League, Cup Winners&#x27; Cup and UEFA Cup, from naming more than three &quot;foreign&quot; players in their squads for any game. After the ruling, quotas could still be imposed, but only used to restrict the number of non-EU players on each team.

According to a 2021 study, the Bosman ruling increased the competitiveness of national team football because it encouraged greater talent development. However, it reduced competition in the Champions League, as non-established teams tended to sell their best players rather than compete against the best teams. The ruling also affected football in other continents, as the foreign slots would be filled by non-EU players, exponentially allowing teams to obtain South American, African and Asian players.

===Players===

Since the ruling came into effect throughout the EU in 1995, several notable players in European football have benefited from the ruling. In 1996, Edgar Davids became Europe&#x27;s first high-profile player to benefit from the ruling when he moved from Ajax to Milan. Ex-Hibernian player Paul Kane became the first UK Bosman transfer, moving from Aberdeen to Norwegian side Viking Stavanger in 1996. In 1999, Steve McManaman became the most lucrative transfer at the time in British football, as &quot;Britain&#x27;s first high-profile Bosman departure&quot;, when he moved from Liverpool to Real Madrid and the deal resulted in McManaman becoming the highest paid British player in history, from 1999 to 2001. Since Davids and McManaman, scores of other notable players became able to negotiate deals according to their market value when their contracts expired, a trend that continued into the 2000s and to this day.

===Clubs===
The ruling meant that clubs could no longer block a move or demand a fee, from the player or from the destination club, if the player left at the end of their contracts.

The Bosman ruling coincided directly with a new era of financial gains in football. In 2005, UEFA declared it was seeking to repair aspects of the ruling because it was believed to be the cause of the increasing rich-poor gap between elite and smaller clubs.

==Significance in EU law==
Bosman confirmed the &quot;rule of reason&quot; approach of the courts used in the important Cassis de Dijon case as not only suitable for issues relating to movement of goods within the EU, but also for cases concerning the free movement of workers.
If free movement is indistinctly applied (i.e. not just against foreign nationals) it could be justified if...
# The measures used were in pursuit of a legitimate aim
#That aim was justified by pressing reasons of public interest

The case also alludes to the fact that &quot;Alpine Investments v Minister van Financiën&quot; provides a similar test for services, and &quot;Gebhard v Consiglio dell&#x27;Ordine degli Avvocati e Procuratori di Milano&quot; for establishment.

===Other cases===
The Bosman ruling was considered and distinguished in &quot;Lehtonen&quot; (2000), a similar case which involved a deadline imposed by FIBA after which basketball teams could not include players who had played for another team in the same season, where it was found that such a restriction was lawful.

<text>Vishnu Sharma (Sanskrit: विष्णुशर्मन् / विष्णुशर्मा) was an Indian scholar and author who wrote the &quot;Panchatantra&quot;, a collection of fables.

==Works==
Panchatantra is one of the most widely translated non-religious books in history. The &quot;Panchatantra&quot; was translated into Middle Persian/Pahlavi in 570 CE by Borzūya and into Arabic in 750 CE by Persian scholar Abdullah Ibn al-Muqaffa as &quot;Kalīlah wa Dimnah&quot; (). In Baghdad, the translation commissioned by Al-Mansur, the second Abbasid Caliph, is claimed to have become &quot;second only to the Qu&#x27;ran in popularity.&quot; &quot;As early as the eleventh century this work reached Europe, and before 1600 it existed in Greek, Latin, Spanish, Italian, German, English, Old Slavonic, Czech, and perhaps other Slavonic languages. Its range has extended from Java to Iceland.&quot; In France, &quot;&quot;at least eleven Panchatantra tales are included in the work of Jean de La Fontaine&quot;.&quot;

==Legend==
The prelude to the &quot;Panchatantra&quot; identifies Vishnu Sharma as the author of the work. Since there is no other independent external evidence about him, &quot;it is impossible to say whether he was the historical author . . .or is himself a literary invention&quot;. Based on analysis of various Indian recensions and the geographical features and animals described in the stories, Kashmir is suggested to be his birthplace by various scholars.

He has also been associated with the University of Taxila.

The prelude narrates the story of how Vishnu Sharma supposedly created the &quot;Panchatantra&quot;. There was a king called Sudarshan who ruled a kingdom, whose capital was a city called Mahilaropya (महिलारोप्य), whose location on the current map of India is unknown. The king had three sons named Bahushakti, Ugrashakti and Anantshakti. Though the king himself was both a scholar and a powerful ruler, his sons were &quot;&quot;all dullards&quot;.&quot; The king despaired of his three princes&#x27; inability to learn, and approached his ministers for counsel. They presented him with conflicting advice, but the words of one, called Sumati, rang true to the king. He said that the sciences, politics and diplomacy were limitless disciplines that took a lifetime to master formally. Instead of teaching the princes scriptures and texts, they should somehow be taught the wisdom inherent in them, and the aged scholar Vishnu Sharma was the man to do it.

Vishnu Sharma was invited to the court, where the king offered him a hundred land grants if he could teach the princes. Vishnu Sharma declined the promised award, saying he did not sell knowledge for money, but accepted the task of making the princes wise to the ways of politics and leadership within six months. Vishnu Sharma knew that he could never instruct these three students through conventional means. He had to employ a less orthodox way, and that was to tell a succession of animal fables – one weaving into another – that imparted to them the wisdom they required to succeed their father. Adapting stories that had been told for thousands of years in India, panchatantra was composed into an entertaining five part work to communicate the essence of diplomacy, relationships, politics and administration to the princes. These five discourses — titled &quot;The Loss of Friends&quot;, &quot;The Winning of Friends&quot;, &quot;Of Crows and Owls&quot;, &quot;Loss of Gains&quot; and &quot;Imprudence&quot; — became the &quot;Panchatantra&quot;, meaning the five (&quot;pancha&quot;) treatises (&quot;tantra&quot;).

<text>SCO Group, Inc. v. International Business Machines Corp., commonly abbreviated as SCO v. IBM, is a civil lawsuit in the United States District Court of Utah. The SCO Group asserted that there are legal uncertainties regarding the use of the Linux operating system due to alleged violations of IBM&#x27;s Unix licenses in the development of Linux code at IBM. The lawsuit was filed in 2003, it has lingered on through the bankruptcy of SCO Group and the adverse result in &quot;SCO v. Novell&quot;, and was reopened for continued litigation by order of a new judge on June 14, 2013. Pursuant to the court order reopening the case, an IBM Motion for Summary Judgment was filed based upon the results of the &quot;Novell&quot; decision. On December 15, 2014, the judge granted most of IBM&#x27;s motion, thereby narrowing the scope of the case, which remained open. On March 1, 2016, following a ruling against the last remaining claims, the judge dismissed SCO&#x27;s suit against IBM with prejudice. SCO filed an appeal later that month. In February 2018, as a result of the appeal and the case being partially remanded to the circuit court, the parties restated their remaining claims and provided a plan to move toward final judgement. In 2021, the case finally ended in a settlement.

== Summary ==
On March 6, 2003, the SCO Group (formerly known as Caldera International and Caldera Systems) filed a $1 billion lawsuit in the United States against IBM for allegedly &quot;devaluing&quot; its version of the UNIX operating system. SCO retained Boies Schiller &amp; Flexner for this, and related subsequent litigation. The amount of alleged damages was later increased to $3 billion, and then $5 billion. SCO claimed that IBM had, without authorization, contributed SCO&#x27;s intellectual property to the codebase of the open source, Unix-like Linux operating system. In May 2003, SCO Group sent letters to members of the Fortune 1000 and Global 500 companies warning them of the possibility of liability if they use Linux.

The claims and counter-claims made by both sides then escalated, with both IBM and Linux distributor Red Hat starting legal action against SCO, SCO threatening Linux users who do not take out SCO UNIX licenses, and SCO suing Novell (see also SCO-Linux controversies), AutoZone and DaimlerChrysler.

On September 30, 2003, Judge Kimball (the presiding federal district judge) granted the SCO Group&#x27;s request for a delay until February 4, 2004, &quot;to file any amended pleadings or add parties to this action&quot;. The schedule was amended again on July 1, 2005. In December 2006 the trial date was vacated pending the resolution of SCO&#x27;s litigation with Novell, all parties agreeing that &quot;SCO v. Novell&quot; would resolve issues relating to &quot;SCO v. IBM&quot;.

In an &quot;Order Granting in Part IBM&#x27;s Motion to Limit SCO&#x27;s Claims&quot; dated June 28, 2006, Judge Brooke Wells (the federal magistrate judge presiding over discovery aspects of the case) barred SCO from asserting 187 of the 298 allegedly misused items that IBM had moved to exclude from the lawsuit for lack of specificity, stating &quot;many of SCO&#x27;s arguments and much of Mr. Rochkind&#x27;s declaration miss the mark&quot;, and comparing SCO&#x27;s tactics with those of an officer who accuses a citizen of theft, but will not disclose what the citizen is accused of stealing. &quot;Certainly if an individual was stopped and accused of shoplifting after walking out of Neiman Marcus, they would expect to be eventually told what they allegedly stole. It would be absurd for an officer to tell the accused that &#x27;you know what you stole I&#x27;m not telling.&#x27; Or, to simply hand the accused individual a catalog of Neiman Marcus&#x27; entire inventory and say &#x27;it&#x27;s in there somewhere, you figure it out.&#x27;&quot;

On August 10, 2007, Judge Kimball, who also presides over the &quot;SCO v. Novell&quot; case, ruled that Novell, not the SCO Group, is the rightful owner of the copyrights covering the Unix operating system. The court also ruled that &quot;SCO is obligated to recognize Novell&#x27;s waiver of SCO&#x27;s claims against IBM and Sequent&quot;. After the ruling Novell announced they have no interest in suing people over Unix and stated &quot;We don&#x27;t believe there is Unix in Linux&quot;.

In an order entered on September 21, 2007, Judge Kimball administratively closed the case of &quot;SCO v. IBM&quot; due to SCO filing for bankruptcy on September 14, 2007. This means that all action in &quot;SCO v. IBM&quot; is stayed until SCO emerges from bankruptcy proceedings. If and when it does, the case &quot;SCO v. IBM&quot; will resume where it left off.

On August 24, 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed the portion of the August 10, 2007 district court summary judgment in &quot;SCO v. Novell&quot; that Novell owned the copyright to Unix. As a result, SCO was permitted to pursue its claim of ownership of the Unix copyrights at trial.

On March 30, 2010, the jury returned a verdict in &quot;SCO v. Novell&quot;, finding that Novell owns the copyrights.

== SCO&#x27;s claims ==
SCO&#x27;s lawsuit has been consistent only in its claim of breach of contract (since the abandonment in early 2004 of its claim of misappropriation of trade secrets). SCO&#x27;s initial claims were:

* Misappropriation of trade secrets
* Unfair competition
* Interference with contract
* Breach of IBM Software Agreement

On July 22, 2003, SCO amended its complaint. It added two new claims:

* Breach of IBM Sublicensing Agreement
* Breach of Sequent Software Agreement

On February 27, 2004, SCO amended the complaint again, dropping the trade secrets claim, but added the following:

* Breach of Sequent Sublicensing Agreement
* Copyright infringement
* Interference with business relationships

SCO&#x27;s claims in press releases and interviews have changed repeatedly as the affair has progressed. SCO has also both claimed and denied that the alleged copyright violations involved the Linux kernel. &quot;Computerworld&quot; reported Chris Sontag of SCO as saying:

SCO refuses to allow access to the samples of code containing the alleged copyright violations except under a non-disclosure agreement (NDA). SCO&#x27;s NDA would not only require that the signer keep confidential which lines of code SCO contested, but would also require that they hold confidential any information SCO told them, even if they already knew that information before being informed of it by SCO; all Linux kernel developers have considered this to be far too restrictive, so none of them have signed it. However, at SCO&#x27;s annual reseller&#x27;s convention in August 2003, they revealed two short sections of code they alleged were copyright violations, and images of Darl McBride&#x27;s presentation of this code were soon after published on German computer magazine publisher Heinz Heise&#x27;s website.

On May 30, 2003, SCO Group&#x27;s CEO Darl McBride was quoted as saying that the Linux kernel contained &quot;hundreds of lines&quot; of code from SCO&#x27;s version of UNIX, and that SCO would reveal the code to other companies under NDA in July. To put this into context, David Wheeler&#x27;s SLOCCount estimates the size of the Linux 2.4.2 kernel as 2,440,919 source lines of code out of over 30 million physical source lines of code for a typical Linux distribution. Therefore, as per SCO&#x27;s own estimate, the allegedly infringing code would make up about 0.001% of the total code of a typical Linux installation. SCO has since upwardly revised this figure to over a million lines of code, however.

SCO&#x27;s major claims have now been reported as relating to the following components of the Linux kernel:

* Symmetric multiprocessing (SMP),
* Non-uniform memory access (NUMA) multiprocessing,
* the read-copy-update (RCU) locking strategy,
** This technique is widely believed to have been developed at Sequent Computer Systems, who were then bought by IBM, who holds several patents (including patent ) on this technique.
* SGI&#x27;s Extended File System (XFS),
* IBM&#x27;s JFS journaling file system

These claims flow from the accusation of breach of contract. The contract between IBM and AT&amp;T Corporation (to which SCO claims to be successor in interest) allows IBM to use the SVR4 code, but the SVR4 code, plus any derivative works made from that code, must be held confidential by IBM. According to IBM&#x27;s interpretation of the contract, and the interpretation published by AT&amp;T in their &quot;$ echo&quot; newsletter in 1985, &quot;derivative works&quot; means any works containing SVR4 code. But according to SCO&#x27;s interpretation, &quot;derivative works&quot; also includes any code built on top of SVR4, even if that does not contain, or even never contained, any SVR4 code. Thus, according to SCO, any AIX operating system code that IBM developed must be kept confidential, even if it contains nothing from SVR4.

== Free software and open source community reaction ==

The lawsuit caused moral indignation and outrage in the free software and open source communities, who consider SCO&#x27;s claims to be without merit and even cynically dishonest. Open source advocates&#x27; arguments include:

* that SCO does not even own the code in question. SCO has often called themselves &quot;The owner of the UNIX operating system&quot;. But that claim is dubious at best. SCO certainly has no clear claim to SVR4 code. This view is now supported by the jury verdict in &quot;SCO v. Novell&quot;.
* that the Linux operating system was unlikely to contain UNIX code, as it had been written from scratch by hundreds of collaborators, with a well-documented provenance and revision history that was entirely in the public view;
* that it made no technical sense to incorporate SCO UNIX code in Linux, as Linux had the technical features that are claimed to have been appropriated already implemented before SCO UNIX had them;
* that even if Linux and SCO UNIX had some code in common, this did not necessarily mean that this code was copied to Linux from SCO UNIX—perhaps the common pieces of code had been legitimately copied from another open source operating system, perhaps a BSD-derived one, or one of the historical UNIX versions previously released by SCO;
* that Caldera Systems had begun as a Linux company before buying SCO&#x27;s UNIX business and certain assets related to it, and has added many Linux-like features to SCO UNIX, and any common code may have in fact been copied from Linux into SCO UNIX:
** and furthermore, that if such reverse copying from Linux itself had occurred, that the distribution of SCO UNIX binaries containing GPL&#x27;d contributions may therefore require SCO either to remove their product from the market until GPL&#x27;d code has been removed, or to release their source code under the GPL to their users;
* that even if Linux did contain copied SCO UNIX code, the UNIX source code had already been made widely available without a non-disclosure agreement, and therefore had no trade secret status (as a judge found in &quot;USL v. BSDi&quot;);
* that even if Linux did contain some UNIX code, the SCO Group had lost any right to sue IBM for trade secret or other intellectual property infringement by distributing Linux itself (their Caldera OpenLinux distribution) under the GNU General Public License (GPL), both before and after their announcement, which precludes them from pursuing any other user of Linux.

SCO and its officers have been the subject of much criticism by the free software community, some of whom have stated that SCO&#x27;s behavior may amount to illegal conduct. SEC filings show that senior SCO executives dumped their personal holdings in SCO shortly after counter-suits were filed by IBM and Red Hat. SCO Group&#x27;s CEO Darl McBride has been the subject of particular criticism, because of his extreme statements to the press.

On March 10, 2003, the Open Source Initiative (OSI) released a position paper on the &quot;SCO v. IBM&quot; complaint, written by Eric S. Raymond, president of the OSI and author of &quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;.

On May 16, 2003, Groklaw, a website founded by journalist/paralegal Pamela Jones, began covering the SCO litigation on a daily basis, and became a voice for the community to express its views of SCO&#x27;s claims, as well as being an experiment in applying Open Source principles to legal research. The SCO Group has singled the site out as a particular thorn in its side.

On May 30, 2003, Linus Torvalds, developer of the Linux kernel, was quoted as saying, regarding the case:

&quot;The Inquirer&quot; reported on June 15, 2003, that an unnamed Linux kernel programmer has written to SCO, threatening action based on their distribution of a Linux distribution that, according to their own claims, contains code not licensed under the GPL. According to the letter reproduced there, the programmer claimed that SCO&#x27;s doing so was an infringement of his own copyright. SCO&#x27;s response to this letter is not known.

In an interview on June 23, 2003, Torvalds responded to SCO&#x27;s allegation that Linux development had no process for vetting kernel contributions:

On June 27, 2003, Eben Moglen, the counsel for the Free Software Foundation, released a more complete statement regarding the SCO lawsuit. In this statement, he reiterates many of the points made above, and states that:

On July 31, 2003, the Open Source Development Labs released a position paper on the ongoing conflict, written by the FSF&#x27;s Eben Moglen.

=== Accusations of creating fear, uncertainty and doubt ===
A number of Linux supporters have characterized SCO&#x27;s actions as an attempt to create fear, uncertainty and doubt about Linux. Many believe that SCO&#x27;s aim is to be bought out by IBM. Others have pointed to Microsoft&#x27;s subsequent licensing of the SCO source code as a possible &quot;quid pro quo&quot; for SCO&#x27;s action.

Univention GmbH, a Linux integrator, reported on May 30, 2003, it was granted an injunction by a Bremen court under German competition law that prohibits the SCO Group&#x27;s German division from claiming that Linux contains illegally obtained SCO intellectual property. If the SCO Group continued to express this position, they would have to pay a fine of €250,000. A similar injunction was sought around the same time in Poland.

On July 23, 2003, Open Source Victoria announced that it had filed a complaint with the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission, &quot;asking the ACCC to investigate the SCO Group&#x27;s activities in light of their unsubstantiated claims and their extortive legal threats for money against possibly hundreds of thousands of Australians&quot;.

SCO Group then filed subpoenas for Richard Stallman and Linus Torvalds on November 13, 2003.

== The GPL issue ==

Within a few months of the filing of the lawsuit, Eben Moglen, the Free Software Foundation&#x27;s legal counsel at the time, stated that SCO&#x27;s suit should not concern Linux users other than IBM. In an interview with &quot;internetnews.com&quot;, he was reported as saying:

Apparently noticing the incongruity of their selling a Linux distribution while suing IBM for stealing their intellectual property and giving it to the developers of that operating system, the SCO Group then announced on May 14, 2003, that they would no longer distribute Linux. According to a press release, SCO said that it would &quot;continue to support existing SCO Linux and Caldera OpenLinux customers and hold them harmless from any SCO intellectual property issues regarding SCO Linux and Caldera OpenLinux products&quot;.

SCO currently claims:

* Any code belonging to SCO that might have been GPL&#x27;d was done by SCO employees without proper legal authorization, and thus is not legally GPL&#x27;d.
* That for code to be GPL&#x27;d, the code&#x27;s copyright owner must put a GPL notice before the code, but since SCO itself was not the one to add the notices, the code was never GPL&#x27;d.

=== GPL and the US Constitution ===
During a certain period of its litigation against IBM, SCO alleged that the GPL violates the United States Constitution. This allegation was dropped however from SCO&#x27;s claims in April 2004 in &quot;SCO&#x27;s Answer to IBM&#x27;s Second Amended Counterclaims&quot;.

SCO originally based its views on the following considerations:

Section 8 of Article One of the United States Constitution states that

Since the GNU General Public License for the most part disclaims exclusive rights, SCO claimed that its use violates this clause. SCO&#x27;s argument asks the court to limit both Congress&#x27;s discretion in implementing the copyright clause, which the Supreme Court refused to do in &quot;Eldred v. Ashcroft&quot;, and copyright holders&#x27; discretion over the enjoyment of their exclusive rights. The GPL specifically prohibits, in section 7, distribution of software in jurisdictions where the laws are incompatible with the GPL, so a ruling that upheld SCO&#x27;s constitutional argument would prevent distribution of Linux (and other copylefted software) in the United States.

Other commentators disagree however. One such commentator, Tom Carey, partner and chairman of a Boston intellectual property law firm, even went so far as to say &quot;Attacks on the GPL are far-fetched and a little bit desperate&quot;. Stacey Quandt, principal analyst at Quandt Analytics, remarked, &quot;SCO&#x27;s prior claim that the GPL was unconstitutional was equivalent to Microsoft&#x27;s claims about open source being un-American—totally ridiculous.&quot;.

Professor Eben Moglen, on leave from the Columbia University law faculty for the year 2006–2007, speaking as counsel to the Free Software Foundation (FSF) who is responsible for drafting the GPL, also takes this view. He says, &quot;I believe the constitutionality attack on the GPL is not a tenable legal argument but is rather a public relations argument.&quot; In a talk at Harvard in February, he addressed the issue of constitutionality by referring to Congress&#x27; recent extension of copyright term limits. &quot;It turns out that there&#x27;s no such thing as an unconstitutional copyright rule,&quot; he said, &quot;if Congress passes it, and if it observes the distinction between expression and idea.&quot;

== Novell enters the controversy ==
Novell entered the controversy by publishing on May 28, 2003, a press release concerning the SCO Group&#x27;s ownership of UNIX. &quot;To Novell&#x27;s knowledge, the 1995 agreement governing SCO&#x27;s purchase of UNIX from Novell does not convey to SCO the associated copyrights,&quot; a letter to the SCO Group&#x27;s CEO Darl McBride said in part. &quot;We believe it unlikely that SCO can demonstrate that it has any ownership interest whatsoever in those copyrights. Apparently you share this view, since over the last few months you have repeatedly asked Novell to transfer the copyrights to SCO, requests that Novell has rejected.&quot;

SCO later claimed to have discovered an amendment to their contract with Novell transferring partial ownership to SCO. Novell stated that the amendment &quot;appears to bear a valid Novell signature, and the language, though convoluted, seems to support SCO&#x27;s claim that ownership of some copyrights for Unix did transfer to SCO&quot;; Novell also said that it could not find its own copy of the amendment.

But in subsequent letters to SCO that Novell released as part of a press release on December 22, 2003, Joseph LaSala Jr., Novell&#x27;s general counsel, argued that the amendment provided for a copyright transfer only under certain conditions that SCO has allegedly failed to meet.

SCO was quick to dismiss Novell&#x27;s claims. The same day, during a conference call to discuss SCO&#x27;s quarterly financial results, SCO CEO Darl McBride said &quot;We see this as a fraudulent filing of copyright notices...and we&#x27;ll take the appropriate measures as necessary with our legal team&quot;. SCO made good on this threat on January 20, 2004, when it filed &quot;SCO v. Novell&quot;. On August 10, 2007, Judge Kimball issued a ruling which says in part &quot;the court concludes that Novell is the owner of the UNIX and UnixWare copyrights.&quot; This decision is expected to impact the &quot;SCO v. IBM&quot; since the ruling states that Novell &quot;is entitled, at its sole discretion, to direct SCO to waive its claims against IBM and Sequent&quot;.

== IBM&#x27;s AIX license ==
Reuters reported that the SCO Group intended to revoke IBM&#x27;s license to use UNIX code in their AIX operating system on June 13, 2003, if no resolution is reached before then. IBM responded that they believe that SCO has no power to do so, as their license is &quot;irrevocable&quot;. On the following Monday, June 16, 2003, CNET reported that SCO had announced it had terminated IBM&#x27;s license. IBM continues to distribute and support AIX, and the SCO Group now states that they will be seeking an injunction to force IBM not only to stop selling and supporting AIX, but also to return to the SCO Group or destroy all copies of the AIX operating system. IBM&#x27;s continued distribution of AIX is the basis of SCO&#x27;s copyright claim.

On June 9, however, Novell privately conversed with SCO expressing their belief that SCO did not have rights to terminate the license. Three days later, Novell cited Section 4.16(b) of their Asset Purchase Agreement (APA) with SCO that gave Novell the ability to intercede in the dispute between SCO and IBM and waived SCO&#x27;s rights to terminate the license.

On August 10, 2007, Judge Kimball ruled that Novell was the owner of UNIX and thus could waive SCO&#x27;s termination of IBM&#x27;s license.

== IBM counterclaims against SCO ==
On August 6, 2003, IBM filed its counterclaims against SCO. It made 10 counterclaims:

* Breach of contract
* Lanham Act violation
* Unfair competition
* Intentional interference with prospective economic relations
* Unfair and deceptive trade practices
* Breach of the GNU General Public License
* and four counts of patent infringement

In response to these counterclaims, SCO asserted that the GPL is unenforceable, void, and violates the United States Constitution, but later dropped that claim. If these claims were true, then the GPL&#x27;d applications that SCO continued to distribute (like Samba) were being distributed without the permission of the copyright owners of those applications (since the permission was the GPL itself), which would be illegal.

On September 25, 2003, IBM amended its counterclaims bringing the total number of counterclaims to 13. The new counterclaims were:

* Copyright infringement
** This counterclaim involved an alleged copyright infringement by SCO of GPL-licensed IBM code in the Linux kernel. Some commentators had pointed out that if SCO managed to invalidate the GPL, they were highly likely to be caught by this counterclaim, as it is of the same form as their claim against IBM.
* Promissory estoppel
* Declaratory judgment

On March 29, 2004, IBM amended its counterclaims again. It dropped one of the patent infringement claims, but added two new Declaratory judgments of Noninfringement of Copyrights. One of these sought a declaration that IBM&#x27;s AIX-related activities did not infringe any of SCO&#x27;s copyrights. The other one sought a similar declaration about IBM&#x27;s Linux-related activities.

== Discovery ==
The discovery portion of the lawsuit lasted several years. The basis for SCO&#x27;s suit is that any code developed on top of SVRX is a derivative work of SVRX (which would include AIX), and that IBM has publicly admitted to contributing AIX code to the Linux kernel. Since SCO has never seen the AIX code, it has, as part of the discovery process, deposed IBM for the AIX code, so that it can compare AIX code to Linux kernel code. IBM, rejecting SCO&#x27;s concept of derivative work, has deposed SCO for which lines of code it claims are infringing. SCO has responded that it can&#x27;t determine which code is infringing until it has had the chance to look at the AIX code.

On December 5, 2003, in the first oral arguments relating to the discovery process, a judge granted IBM&#x27;s two motions to compel against SCO, and deferred consideration of SCO&#x27;s motions until later. This gave SCO a 30-day deadline to provide &quot;with specificity&quot; which lines of code in Linux they claim form the basis of their case. This was widely regarded as a first-round victory for IBM.

On June 28, 2006, Judge Brooke Wells granted IBM&#x27;s motion to strike most of SCO&#x27;s evidence, citing in part SCO&#x27;s inability to provide the specificity required by the court:

SCO appealed to Judge Kimball and asked for a &quot;de novo&quot; review of Judge Wells&#x27; order. On November 29, 2006, Judge Dale Kimball affirmed Judge Wells&#x27; order in its entirety.

== Controversial code ==
At a reseller show in August 2003, SCO revealed a sample of alleged copied code. This was later shown to have been originally released under a BSD License.

The code (atealloc) had been in the IA-64 version of Linux for a short period of time, but had already been removed on July 4, 2003, for technical reasons and because &quot;it&#x27;s ugly as hell.&quot;

UNIX creator Dennis Ritchie confirmed that either he or Ken Thompson wrote the atealloc code, which is released under the BSD license. It is claimed that SCO removed the original license text from Unix source (such as the Berkeley packet filter), allegedly violating the BSD license.

== Copyright claims and DMCA notices ==
In late December 2003, new developments involving copyright claims emerged.

Novell registered their claim to the copyright of original UNIX source code, effectively challenging SCO&#x27;s registration of the same code.

SCO Group claimed in a press release to have sent DMCA notification letters alleging copyright infringement. Alleged copies of these letters were posted online. The letters give the names of 65 files in the Linux source code tree which supposedly incorporate &quot;copyrighted binary interfaces&quot;. Linus Torvalds then posted a rebuttal on Groklaw.

<text>Lakshmana (, ), also known as Laxmana, Lakhan, Saumitra, and Ramanuja, is the younger brother of Rama in the Hindu epic &quot;Ramayana&quot;. He is considered as an incarnation of Shesha, the lord of serpents. Lakshmana was married to Urmila, and is known for his loyalty and dedication towards Rama.

Lakshmana was born to King Dasharatha of Ayodhya and Queen Sumitra. Shatrughna, is his twin brother. He was married to Urmila, after his brother Rama married Sita in her swayamvara. Lakshmana devoted himself to Rama since childhood and accompanied him during his fourteen-year exile, serving him and Sita endlessly. He also played a pivotal role in the war and killed Meghanada. Lakshmana is worshipped in Hinduism, at various places in India, alongside Rama and Sita.

== Etymology ==
The name Lakshmana is of Sanskrit origin, which means &#x27;the one endowed with auspicious signs&#x27;. He bears the epithets of Saumitra (, ) and Ramanuja (, ).

== Legend ==
=== Birth and early life ===
King Dasharatha of Ayodhya had three wives: Kausalya, Kaikeyi, and Sumitra. He performed a yajna-Ashwamedha yajna to beget sons and as a result, his queens became pregnant. Lakshmana and his brother Shatrughna were born to Sumitra, while Rama and Bharata were born to Kausalya and Kaikeyi respectively.

In the Puranas, Lakshmana is described as an incarnation of Shesha, the multiple-headed naga (serpent) upon whom rests the preserver deity Vishnu, whose avatar Rama is considered to be. When sage Vishvamitra asked Rama to kill the demons in the forest, Lakshmana accompanied them and went to Mithila with them. Vishvamitra gives them the knowledge of the &quot;Devastras&quot; or celestial weaponry [bala and ati bala], trains them in advanced religion and guides them to kill powerful demons like Tataka, Maricha and Subahu.

=== Marriage to Urmila ===
After Rama won the svayamvara of Sita, their marriage was fixed. King Dasharatha arrived in Mithila for his son&#x27;s wedding and noticed that Lakshmana had feelings for Urmila, but according to tradition, Bharata and Mandavi were to marry first. King Dasharatha then arranged for Bharata to marry Mandavi and Shatrughna to marry Shrutakirti, allowing Lakshmana to marry Urmila. Ultimately, all four sisters married the four brothers, strengthening the alliance between the two kingdoms. The wedding ceremony was conducted under the guidance of Shatananda. During the homeward journey to Ayodhya, another avatar of Vishnu, Parashurama, challenged Rama to combat, on the condition that he was able to string the bow of Vishnu, Sharanga. When Rama obliged him with success, Parashurama acknowledged the former to be a form of Vishnu and departed to perform penance at the mountain Mahendra. The wedding entourage then reached Ayodhya, entering the city amid great fanfare.

According to Vishwamitra, Urmila and Lakshmana equals each other in &quot;grace and heritage&quot;. Urmila and Lakshmana had two sons named Angada and Chandraketu. Urmila is described as being as dedicated to Sita as he was to Rama.

=== Exile and war ===
Lakshmana served Rama and Sita reverently during the exile. In Panchavati, Lakshmana also built a hut for Rama and Sita to live in. Lakshmana cut off Ravana&#x27;s sister Surpanakha&#x27;s nose in anger when she tried to seduce Rama and insulted Sita. He played an important role in the war with Ravana and slew Ravana&#x27;s sons Indrajita (Meghanada) and Atikaya.

On the first night of exile, when Rama and Sita were sleeping, the deity Nidra appeared before Lakshmana and he requested her to offer him the boon of not sleeping for the fourteen years. The goddess asked him that she could grant his wish, but someone else would have to take his place asleep. Lakshmana asked the goddess to enquire his wife Urmila regarding this, who happily accepted the task. Urmila slept continuously for the fourteen years of exile, to complete the sleep of her and her husband&#x27;s share. Urmila is notable for this unparalleled sacrifice, which is called &quot;Urmila Nidra.&quot;

When Sita asked Rama to fetch a magical golden deer for her, Rama asked Lakshmana to stand guard as he sensed danger and evil. The golden deer was the demon Maricha, who distracted Rama. When Rama killed Maricha, he cried out in Rama&#x27;s voice for help. Although Lakshmana knew that Rama was invincible and beyond any danger, Sita panicked and frantically ordered Lakshmana to go to Rama&#x27;s aid immediately. Unable to disobey Sita, Lakshmana drew a perimeter line (Lakshmana Rekha), which Sita must not cross and went in search of Rama. Sita, however, out of compulsion of religious duty and compassion for Ravana, who was disguised as a poor Brahmin, crossed the line to give him alms, following which she was abducted.

Through their search for Sita, Rama and Lakshmana meet Hanuman, the biggest devotee of Rama, greatest of ape heroes, and an adherent of Sugriva. Rama befriends Sugriva and helps him by killing his elder brother Vali, thus regaining the kingdom of Kiṣkindha, in exchange for helping Rāma to recover Sita. However, Sugriva soon forgets his promise and this enrage Lakshmana, who was ready to destroy the ape citadel.

During the war between Rama and Ravana, Meghanada hurls a powerful weapon at Lakshmana and he is mortally wounded. So Hanumana assumes his gigantic form and flies from Lanka to the Himalayas. Upon reaching mountain, Hanuman is unable to identify the herb, sanjeevani, that will cure Lakshmana and so he decides to bring the entire mountain back to Lanka. Post his recovery, Lakshmana killed Meghanada and Atikaya, who were the sons of Ravana.

=== Post exile ===
After the end of the Lanka war, Rama was crowned King of Kosala, and Bharata became the crown prince. Rama had offered to make Lakshmana the crown prince, but he refused, saying Bharata was elder to him and more deserving of the title. Rama, hearing this, was very pleased and said &quot;O Lakshmana, in this birth, you served me so well and did your duties as a younger brother, so I will do the same in my next birth as your younger brother&quot;. Thus, in the next birth, Rama became Krishna and Lakshmana became Balarama, Krishna&#x27;s elder brother.

Goddess Nidra had told Lakshman that he would have to go to sleep as soon as the exile ends, so that Urmila could awake. After the exile, Lakshaman went to sleep and Urmila saw the coronation of Rama.
Lakshmana was the one who left Sita in the forests near sage Valmiki&#x27;s ashram after she expressed her desire to leave the kingdom. Lakshmana remained loyal to his brother and fought against Rama&#x27;s sons Lava and Kusha later on.

According to the &quot;Uttara Kanda&quot;, Lakshmana had ruled over Karupada with Urmila as the queen; which was inherited by his elder son, Angada; whilst Lakshmana&#x27;s younger son, Chandraketu had inherited Mallya, with its capital Chandrakanti being commissioned by Rama.

===Renunciation of life===
Sage Durvasa appeared at Rama&#x27;s doorstep, and seeing Lakshmana guarding the door, demanded an audience with Rama. At the time, Rama was having a private conversation with Yama. Before the conversation began, Yama gave Rama strict instructions that their dialogue was to remain confidential, and anyone who entered the room was to be relieved of their life. Rama agreed and entrusted Lakshmana with the duty of guarding his door. When Durvasa made his demand, Lakshmana politely refused. The sage grew angry and threatened to curse all of Ayodhya if Lakshmana did not immediately inform Rama of his arrival.

Lakshmana, in a dilemma, decided it would be better that he alone die to save all of Ayodhya from falling under Durvasa&#x27;s curse and so interrupted Rama&#x27;s meeting to inform him of the sage&#x27;s arrival. Durvasa cursed him that he should go to heaven alive. Rama quickly concluded his meeting with Yama and received the sage with due courtesy. In order to fulfil his brother&#x27;s promise, Lakshmana went to the banks of the river Sarayu, resolved on giving up the world by drowning himself in the Sarayu. From there, Indra removed Lakshmana from the water and took him alive to heaven.

== Belief and assessment ==
Lakshmana has been described in the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, as a man with unwavering loyalty, love and commitment to his elder brother, through times of joy and adversity alike. He was also noted for being an obedient son, both to his parents and to his sister-in-law.

Bandhavgarh Fort in Madhya Pradesh (&quot;bandhav&quot; as brother, &quot;garh&quot; as fort) was said to have been given by Rama to his brother Lakshmana to keep a watch on Lanka.

Military officers given the rank equivalent of admirals in navies in the Malay Archipelago, including Malaysia and Indonesia, are titled &quot;Lakshmana&quot; (Jawi script: ) after the figure. There are five ranks with his name, under General/flag officers.

== Lakshamana Parshuram Conversation ==
The Lakshmana-Parashurama dialogue in the Bal Kand of the Ramayana is one of the most famous and profound exchanges in Hindu scriptures. This interaction is not only a story but also a medium for imparting deep philosophical, religious, and social teachings. The dialogue involves three prominent characters – Lord Rama, Lakshmana, and Parashurama, each embodying unique virtues and qualities.

The confrontation begins after Lord Rama breaks Lord Shiva’s bow at Sita&#x27;s Swayamvara. Parashurama, who holds a deep connection with Lord Shiva and his bow, becomes enraged. His anger is fueled not just by the bow’s breaking, but also by his own sense of pride and superiority in warfare. In this moment, Lord Rama confronts Parashurama with great wisdom, leading to the insightful dialogue that unfolds.

=== Expansion of the Dialogue ===
Upon hearing of the broken bow, Parashurama storms into King Janak’s court in a rage. His anger strikes fear into the hearts of the assembled kings. Demanding the guilty party, he accuses the person who broke Shiva’s bow of being his enemy. Lakshmana, without hesitation, mocks Parashurama&#x27;s anger, pointing out the absurdity of getting so upset over an old bow. Parashurama’s response is full of pride, recounting his past battles and his self-proclaimed superiority over the Kshatriyas.

Lakshmana continues to taunt Parashurama, claiming that all bows are the same and that breaking an old one is not such a great offense. The conversation escalates as Parashurama, enraged by Lakshmana’s insolence, declares that his axe can destroy anyone who stands in his way. Lakshmana, ever fearless, continues to challenge Parashurama, saying that true bravery is shown through actions, not words.

As Parashurama raises his axe in anger, Lakshmana dismisses it as a mere show of force. The sage’s pride, however, is not easily quelled, and he declares that he is sparing Lakshmana’s life only out of respect for Vishwamitra’s request.

The exchange reaches a turning point when Lord Rama steps in, calming the situation with his characteristic wisdom. He reminds Parashurama of his own virtuous nature and urges him to show mercy to the young Lakshmana. Rama humbly offers to take the blame for the incident, requesting Parashurama to forgive Lakshmana.

==In other versions==
=== Jain version ===


Lakshmana is referred to as Vasudeva in the Jain Ramayana. According to the Jain Ramayana, it was Lakshmana who killed Ravana, not Rama. According to Jain storytelling, Lakshmana had around sixteen thousand wives in which Prithvisundari was his principle consort (in the Hindu epic, he had only one wife Urmila).

=== Gond version ===
Lakshmana is the main protagonist in the &quot;Gond Ramayani&quot;. In this version, that is set post the Lanka war, Lakshmana goes through agnipravesham and not Sita.

=== Mahaviracharita ===
The Sanskrit play &quot;Mahaviracharita&quot; by Bhavabhuti is based on the early life of Rama. According to the play, Vishwamitra invites Janaka to attend his sacrifice, but he sends his brother Kushadhvaja and daughters Sita and Urmila, as his delegates. This is the place, where Laxman and Urmila meet for the first time. By the end of the act, Kushadhvaja and Vishwamitra decide to marry Sita and Urmila to Rama and Lakshamana.

== Temples and worship ==
Although Lakshmana is worshipped with Rama in Rama temples, there are some temples dedicated him, where he is worshipped alongside his wife, Urmila.

* In Bharatpur district of Rajasthan, there is a temple dedicated to Lakshmana and Urmila. The temple was built in 1870 AD by the then ruler Balwant Singh of Bharatpur and is considered as a &quot;Royal temple&quot; by the royal family of Bharatpur State.
* In Bhind district of Madhya Pradesh, there is another temple dedicated to Lakshmana and Urmila.
* In the Medak district of Telangana, there is a temple called Sri Kalyana Ramachandra Sannadhi that is dedicated to Lakshman and Urmila. This temple is the only one in India that has installed statues of Rama&#x27;s brothers and their wives.
* In the Ernakulam district of Kerala, there is a temple dedicated to Lakshmana, called Thirumoozhikkulam Lakshmana Perumal Temple.
* In Thrissur district of Kerala, there is a temple called Vilwadrinatha Temple, where Lakshmana is one of the main deity.
* In Kottayam district of Kerala, there is a temple dedicated to Lakshmana and Rama, called the Vennimala Sree Rama Lakshmana Temple.

<text>Biopsychosocial models are a class of trans-disciplinary models which look at the interconnection between biology, psychology, and socio-environmental factors. These models specifically examine how these aspects play a role in a range of topics but mainly psychiatry, health and human development.  

The term is generally used to describe a model advocated by George L. Engel in 1977. The model builds upon the idea that &quot;illness and health are the result of an interaction between biological, psychological, and social factors.&quot; which according to Derick T. Wade and Peter W. Halligan, as of 2017, is generally accepted.  The idea behind the model was to express mental distress as a triggered response of a disease that a person is genetically vulnerable when stressful life events occur. In that sense, it is also known as vulnerability-stress model. It is now referred to as a generalized model that interprets similar aspects, and has become an alternative to the biomedical and/or psychological dominance of many health care systems. The biopsychosocial model has been growing in interest for researchers in healthcare and active medical professionals in the past decade.

==History==

George L. Engel and Jon Romano of the University of Rochester in 1977, are widely credited with being the first to propose a biopsychosocial model. However, it had been proposed 100 years earlier and by others. Engel struggled with the then-prevailing biomedical approach to medicine as he strove for a more holistic approach by recognizing that each patient has their own thoughts, feelings, and history. In developing his model, Engel framed it for both illnesses and psychological problems.

The biopsychosocial model is not just one of many competing possibilities - another intelligently constructed explanation of health. Its emergence is best understood within a historical context. The biopsychosocial model&#x27;s emergence in psychiatry was influenced by the credibility problem in psychiatry as a medical specialism that arose during wartime conditions.  

By the 20th century, psychiatry was still a relatively new field. In the Victorian era, psychiatry was faced with two key challenges: firstly, taking control of the asylum system from lay administrators and secondly, constructing a credible knowledge base for medical authority over mental illness. At the time, the solution to this was developing a rhetoric of justification for psychiatry which was that the brain is the root of insanity, and physicians are the guardians of mental health. This position both reflected and contributed to the rise of eugenics thought in western intellectual culture. However, this was challenged by the shellshock problem after World War I – there was a fundamental incompatibility between a eugenic view of lunacy and the sad reality of respectable men breaking down with predictable regularity in the war trenches. This led to the recognition of neurosis and acceptance of psychoanalysis in psychiatric discourse. A year after the end of the war, the British Psychoanalytical Society and the Medical Section of the British Psychological Society were both established, marking the start of a nuanced interplay between biological psychiatry and medical psychotherapy. The Tavistock Clinic played a significant role in bridging the gap between these approaches and favoured a unified psychosomatic approach. Under these conditions, the biopsychosocial model was set up to revolutionise our understanding of psychiatry and health.

There are a number of key theorists that predate the biopsychosocial model. For example, Engel broadened medical thinking by re-proposing a separation of body and mind. The idea of mind–body dualism goes back at least to René Descartes, but was forgotten during the biomedical approach. Engel emphasized that the biomedical approach is flawed because the body alone does not contribute to illness. Instead, the individual mind (psychological and social factors) play a significant role in how an illness is caused and how it is treated. Engel proposed a dialogue between the patient and the doctor in order to find the most effective treatment solution.

The idea that there are several factors that may contribute to one&#x27;s mental suffering is nothing new. Past psychologists such as Urie Bronfenbrenner, popularized the belief that social factors play a role in developing illnesses and behaviors. Simply, Engel used Bronfenbrenner&#x27;s research as a column of his biopsychosocial model and framed this model to display health at the center of social, psychological, and biological aspects.

Adolf Meyer&#x27;s psychobiology model is considered the forerunner to the biopsychosocial model by many. Meyer emphasised understanding mental illness in the context of a patient&#x27;s personal history over diagnostic categories. Meyer laid down the groundwork for understanding the interplay of psychology and biology but tended to view these as separate entities that interacted. Engel&#x27;s model represents a broader and more integrated approach that considers biological, psychological, and social factors as interconnected elements.

However, Roy Grinker actually coined the term &#x27;biopsychosocial&#x27; long before Engel (1954 vs 1977). The difference between the two researchers is that Grinker sought to highlight biological aspects of mental health. Engel instead emphasised psychosocial aspects of general health.

After publication, the biopsychosocial model was adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2002 as a basis for the International Classification of Function. However, the WHO definition of health adopted in 1948 implied a broad socio-medical perspective.

== Patient populations ==
The patients that fall under the biopsychosocial model may not fall under the biomedical model, as the biopsychosocial model considers factors that may not physiologically manifest in a person. By broadening the scope of patients that are encompassed in healthcare, the biopsychosocial model incorporates the idea of non-biological factors such as socioeconomic status, race, and sex to be important components to one&#x27;s health along with the common biological indicators. Until recent years, the conventional method for handling health and illness centered around the medical or biological model, concentrating solely on medical interventions to address an individual&#x27;s health issues. While this approach was once deemed sufficient, contemporary research within psychology and the social sciences has cast doubt on its effectiveness. Scholars are now working on developing a broader health model, incorporating insights from psychology and social sciences, with the intention of improving its practical application in clinical settings.

Patient populations that the biopsychosocial model accounts for that may not be considered under the biomedical model include those affected by health inequities and those at risk of infirmity.  

Health inequities, often rooted in social determinants of health, highlight the disparities in health outcomes experienced by different populations. The biopsychosocial model, which considers biological, psychological, and social factors in understanding health, provides a framework for comprehending how these disparities arise and persist, which makes it a model of interest in targeting health inequities. A holistic biopsychosocial model approach considers additional elements influencing the perceived necessity for healthcare and the focus on health-related matters: Information, Beliefs, and Conduct. Based on the model&#x27;s dependence on perception, it has been considered imperative to actively engage the individuals or communities whose requirements are being addressed, regardless of whether the focus is on their health, education, employment, housing, or any other needs. A key term in the biopsychosocial model is &quot;syndemic&quot; which refers to a set of health problem factors that interact synergistically with each other ranging from socioeconomic status to genetics.

Preventative medicine is a large component of biopsychosocial model which considers preventative measures to stop patients from obtaining infirmity in the first place. By combatting preventable chronic diseases which make up a majority of deaths in patients of the US, the BPS model has been considered a potential tool to improve patient outcomes.  

== Biopsychosocial model vs. Biomedical model ==
The biomedical and biopsychosocial models offer distinct perspectives on understanding and addressing health and illness. The biomedical model, historically prevalent, takes a reductionist approach by focusing on biological factors and treating diseases through medical interventions. In contrast, the biopsychosocial model adopts a holistic viewpoint, acknowledging the complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors in shaping health and illness. Unlike the biomedical model, which sees diseases as isolated physical abnormalities, the biopsychosocial model views them as outcomes of dynamic interactions among various dimensions. Treatment under the biopsychosocial model is comprehensive, involving medical, psychological, and social interventions to address overall well-being. This model emphasizes the interconnectedness of these dimensions, recognizing their mutual influence on an individual&#x27;s health.

== Institutional recognition ==
In the last decade, there has been a rising interest among healthcare researchers and practicing medical professionals in the biopsychosocial model. However, despite the rising interest, medical schools have had limited use of the model in their curriculums relative to the increasing literature about the model.

==Current status ==
The biopsychosocial model is still widely used as both a philosophy of clinical care and a practical clinical guide useful for broadening the scope of a clinician&#x27;s gaze. Borrell-Carrió and colleagues reviewed Engel&#x27;s model 25 years on. They proposed the model had evolved into a biopsychosocial and relationship-centered framework for physicians. They proposed three clarifications to the model, and identified seven established principles.

# Self-awareness.
# Active cultivation of trust.
# An emotional style characterized by empathic curiosity.
# Self-calibration as a way to reduce bias.
# Educating the emotions to assist with diagnosis and forming therapeutic relationships.
# Using informed intuition.
# Communicating clinical evidence to foster dialogue, not just the mechanical application of protocol.
Gatchel and colleagues argued in 2007 the biopsychosocial model is the most widely accepted as the most heuristic approach to understanding and treating chronic pain.

==Relevant theories and theorists==

Other theorists and researchers are using the term biopsychosocial, or sometimes bio-psycho-social to distinguish Engel&#x27;s model.

Lumley and colleagues used a non-Engel model to conduct a biopsychosocial assessment of the relationship between and pain and emotion. Zucker and Gomberg used a non-Engel biopsychosocial perspective to assess the etiology of alcoholism in 1986.

Crittenden considers the Dynamic-Maturational Model of Attachment and Adaptation (DMM), to be a biopsychosocial model. It incorporates many disciplines to understand human development and information processing.

Kozlowska&#x27;s Functional Somatic Symptoms model uses a biopsychosocial approach to understand somatic symptoms. Siegel&#x27;s Interpersonal Neurobiology (IPNB) model is similar, although, perhaps to distinguish IPNB from Engel&#x27;s model, he describes how the brain, mind, and relationships are part of one reality rather three separate elements. Most trauma informed care models are biopsychosocial models.

== Biopsychosocial research ==
Wickrama and colleagues have conducted several biopsychosocial-based studies examining marital dynamics. In a longitudinal study of women divorced midlife they found that divorce contributed to an adverse biopsychosocial process for the women. In another study of enduring marriages, they looked to see if hostile marital interactions in the early middle years could wear down couples regulator systems through greater psychological distress, more health-risk behaviors, and a higher body mass index (BMI). Their findings confirmed negative outcomes and increased vulnerability to later physical health problems for both husbands and wives.

Kovacs and colleagues meta-study examined the biopsychosocial experiences of adults with congenital heart disease. Zhang and colleagues used a biopsychosocial approach to examine parents own physiological response when facing children&#x27;s negative emotions, and how it related to parents’ ability to engage in sensitive and supportive behaviors. They found parents’ physiological regulatory functioning was an important factor in shaping parenting behaviors directed toward children&#x27;s emotions.

A biopsychosocial approach was used to assess race and ethnic differences in aging and to develop the Michigan Cognitive Aging Project. Banerjee and colleagues used a biopsychosocial narrative to describe the dual pandemic of suicide and COVID-19.

==Potential applications==

When Engel first proposed the biopsychosocial model it was for the purpose of better understanding health and illness. While this application still holds true the model is relevant to topics such as health, medicine, and development. Firstly, as proposed by Engel, it helps physicians better understand their whole patient. Considering not only physiological and medical aspects but also psychological and sociological well-being. Furthermore, this model is closely tied to health psychology. Health psychology examines the reciprocal influences of biology, psychology, behavioral, and social factors on health and illness.

One application of the biopsychosocial model within health and medicine relates to pain, such that several factors outside an individual&#x27;s health may affect their perception of pain. For example, a 2019 study linked genetic and biopsychosocial factors to increased post-operative shoulder pain. Future studies are needed to model and further explore the relationship between biopsychosocial factors and pain.

The developmental applications of this model are equally relevant. One particular advantage of applying the biopsychosocial model to developmental psychology is that it allows for an intersection within the nature versus nurture debate. This model provides developmental psychologists a theoretical basis for the interplay of both hereditary and psychosocial factors on an individual&#x27;s development.

== In gender ==
Within the framework of the biopsychosocial model, gender is regarded by some as a complex and nuanced construct, shaped by the intricate interplay of social, psychological, and biological factors. This perspective, as echoed by the Gender Spectrum Organization, defines gender as the multifaceted interrelationship between three key dimensions: body, identity, and social gender. In essence, this characterization aligns with the fundamental principles of the biopsychosocial model, emphasizing the need to consider not only biological determinants but also the profound influences of psychological and social contexts on the formation of gender.

According to the insights of Alex Iantaffi and Meg-John Barker, the biopsychosocial model provides a comprehensive framework to understand the complexities of gender. They illustrate that biological, psychological, and social factors are not isolated entities but rather intricately intertwined elements that continually interact and shape one another. In this dynamic process, a person&#x27;s gender identity emerges as the result of a complex interplay between their biological characteristics, psychological experiences, and social interactions. This holistic perspective is in harmony with the biopsychosocial model&#x27;s approach, which acknowledges the inseparable connection between these various dimensions in influencing an individual&#x27;s overall well-being.

In essence, within the biopsychosocial paradigm, gender is not merely a product of biological determinants; rather, it is a dynamic and interconnected aspect of human identity. This perspective urges a more nuanced understanding, encouraging researchers and medical professionals to consider the intricate interplay of social, psychological, and biological factors when exploring and addressing the complexities of gender.

==Criticisms==
There have been a number of criticisms of Engel&#x27;s biopsychosocial model. Benning summarized the arguments against the model including that it lacked philosophical coherence, was insensitive to patients&#x27; subjective experience, was unfaithful to the general systems theory that Engel claimed it be rooted in, and that it engendered an undisciplined eclecticism that provides no safeguards against either the dominance or the under-representation of any one of the three domains of bio, psycho, or social.

Psychiatrist Hamid Tavakoli argues that Engel&#x27;s biopsychosocial model should be avoided because it unintentionally promotes an artificial distinction between biology and psychology, and merely causes confusion in psychiatric assessments and training programs, and that ultimately it has not helped the cause of trying to de-stigmatize mental health. The perspectives model does not make that arbitrary distinction.

A number of these criticisms have been addressed over recent years. For example, the biopsychosocial pathways model describes how it is possible to conceptually separate, define, and measure biological, psychological, and social factors, and thereby seek detailed interrelationships among these factors.

While Engel&#x27;s call to arms for a biopsychosocial model has been taken up in several healthcare fields and developed in related models, it has not been adopted in acute medical and surgical domains, as of 2017.

<doc id="236205" wikidata="Q8824673" url="?curid=236205" title="SCO Group">
<text>The SCO Group (often referred to SCO and later called The TSG Group) was an American software company in existence from 2002 to 2012 that became known for owning Unix operating system assets that had belonged to the Santa Cruz Operation (the original SCO), including the UnixWare and OpenServer technologies, and then, under CEO Darl McBride, pursuing a series of high-profile legal battles known as the SCO–Linux controversies.

The SCO Group began in 2002 with a renaming of Caldera International, accompanied by McBride becoming CEO and a major change in business strategy and direction. The SCO brand was re-emphasized, and new releases of UnixWare and OpenServer came out. The company also attempted some initiatives in the e-commerce space with the SCOBiz and SCOx programs. In 2003, the SCO Group claimed that the increasingly popular free Linux operating system contained substantial amounts of Unix code that IBM had improperly put there. The SCOsource division was created to monetize the company&#x27;s intellectual property by selling Unix license rights to use Linux. The &quot;SCO v. IBM&quot; lawsuit was filed, asking for billion-dollar damages and setting off one of the top technology battles in the history of the industry. By a year later, four additional lawsuits had been filed involving the company.

Reaction to SCO&#x27;s actions from the free and open-source software community was intensely negative, and the general IT industry was not enamored of the actions either. SCO soon became, as &quot;Businessweek&quot; headlined, &quot;The Most Hated Company in Tech&quot;. SCO Group stock rose rapidly during 2003, but then SCOsource revenue became erratic and the stock began a long fall. Despite the industry&#x27;s attention to the lawsuits, SCO continued to maintain a product focus as well, putting out a major new release of OpenServer that incorporated the UnixWare kernel inside it. SCO also made a major push in the burgeoning smartphones space, launching the Me Inc. platform for mobility services. But despite these actions, the company steadily lost money and shrank in size.

In 2007, SCO suffered a major adverse ruling in the &quot;SCO v. Novell&quot; case that rejected SCO&#x27;s claim of ownership of Unix-related copyrights and undermined much of the rest of its legal position. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection soon after and attempted to continue operations. Its mobility and Unix software assets were sold off in 2011, to McBride and UnXis respectively. Renamed to The TSG Group, the company converted to Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2012. A portion of the &quot;SCO v. IBM&quot; case continued on until 2021, when a settlement was reached for a tiny fraction of what SCO had initially sued for.

== Initial history ==
=== Background ===
The Santa Cruz Operation had been an American software company, founded in 1979 in Santa Cruz, California, that found success during the 1980s and 1990s selling Unix-based operating system products for Intel x86-based server systems. SCO built a large community of value-added resellers that eventually became 15,000 strong and many of its sales of its SCO OpenServer product to small and medium-sized businesses went through those resellers. In 1995, SCO bought the System V Release 4 and UnixWare business from Novell (which had two years earlier acquired the AT&amp;T-offshoot Unix System Laboratories) to improve its technology base. But beginning in the late 1990s, SCO faced increasingly severe competitive pressure, on one side from Microsoft&#x27;s Windows NT and its successors and on the other side from the free and open source Linux. In 2001, the Santa Cruz Operation sold its rights to Unix and its SCO OpenServer and UnixWare products to Caldera International.

Caldera, based in Orem, Utah, was founded in 1994 by several former Novell employees who saw promise in Linux as a technology and failed to convince Novell management to move forward with it. Caldera&#x27;s early funding came from Ray Noorda, the former CEO of Novell, and the Utah Valley-based Canopy Group investment fund that Noorda started for high-technology firms. The company had been in the business of selling its Caldera OpenLinux product but had never been profitable. It attempted to make a combined business out of Linux and Unix but failed to make headway and had suffered continuing financial difficulties. By June 2002, after it had moved to nearby Lindon, its stock was facing a second delisting notice from NASDAQ and the company had less than four months&#x27; cash for operations. As &quot;Wired&quot; magazine later wrote, the company &quot;faced a nearly hopeless situation&quot;.

On June 27, 2002, Caldera International had a change in management, with Darl McBride, formerly an executive with Novell, FranklinCovey, and several start-ups, taking over as CEO from Caldera co-founder Ransom Love.

=== Back to a SCO name ===
Change under McBride happened quickly. On August 26, 2002, he announced at the company&#x27;s annual Forum conference relocated from Santa Cruz to Las Vegas that Caldera International was changing its name to The SCO Group. He did this via a multimedia display in which an image of Caldera was shattered and replaced by The SCO Group&#x27;s logo, which was a slightly more stylized version of the old Santa Cruz Operation logo. The attendees at the conference, most of whom were veteran SCO partners and resellers, responded to the announcement with enthusiastic applause. McBride announced, &quot;SCO is back from the dead&quot;, and a story in &quot;The Register&quot; began &quot;SCO lives again&quot;. As part of this, the company adopted SCOX as its trading symbol.

The change back to a SCO-based name reflected recognition of the reality that almost all of the company&#x27;s revenue was coming from Unix, not Linux, products. For instance, McDonald&#x27;s had recently expanded its usage of OpenServer from 4,000 to 10,000 stores; indeed, both OpenServer and UnixWare were strong in the replicated sites business. Furthermore the SCO brand was better known than the Caldera one, especially in Europe, and SCO&#x27;s large, existing reseller and partner channel was resistant to switching to Caldera&#x27;s product priorities.

McBride emphasized that the OpenServer product was still selling: &quot;What is it with the OpenServer phenomenon? We can&#x27;t kill it. One customer last month bought $4 million in OpenServer licenses. The customers want to give us money for it. Why don&#x27;t we just sell it?&quot; As a historical comparison for his strategy of building back up the brand and being more responsive to customers, McBride used a model of the revival of the Harley-Davidson brand in the 1980s. Besides McBride, other company executives, including new senior vice president of technology Opinder Bawa, were heavily involved in the change of direction.

The product name Caldera OpenLinux became &quot;SCO Linux powered by UnitedLinux&quot; and all other Caldera branded names were changed as well.
In particular, the longstanding UnixWare name which Caldera had changed to Open UNIX was restored, such that what had been called Open UNIX 8 was now named in proper sequence as UnixWare 7.1.2. Announcements were made that a new OpenServer release, 5.0.7, and a new UnixWare release, 7.1.3, would appear at the end of the year or beginning of the next. Moreover, through a new program called SCO Update, more frequent updates of capabilities were promised beyond that. Caldera&#x27;s Volution Messaging Server product was retained and renamed SCOoffice Server, but the other Caldera Volution products were split off under the names Volution Technologies, Center 7, and finally Vintela.
=== Software releases and e-commerce initiatives SCOBiz and SCOx ===
In addition to reviving SCO&#x27;s longtime operating system products, the SCO Group also announced a new venture, SCOBiz. SCOBiz was a collaboration with the Bellingham, Washington-based firm Vista.com, founded in 1999 by John Wall, in which SCO partners could sell Vista.com&#x27;s online, web-based e-commerce development and hosting service targeted at small and medium-sized businesses. More importantly, as part of SCOBiz, the two companies would develop a SOAP- and XML-based web services interface to enable Vista.com e-commerce front-ends to communicate with existing back-end SCO-based applications. Industry analysts were somewhat skeptical of the chances for SCOBiz succeeding, as the market was already crowded with application service provider offerings and the dot-com bubble had already burst by that point.

Lastly, SCO announced a new program for partners, called SCOx. A key feature of SCOx was a buyout option that allowed SCOx solution providers to sell their businesses back to SCO. McBride stated that the program would give partners a chance at &quot;living the American dream&quot;.

The company&#x27;s financial hole was emphasized when it released its results for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2002 it had lost $25 million on revenues of $64 million.

The previously announced operating system releases began appearing, beginning with a Linux release. Caldera International had been one of the founders of the United Linux initiative, along with SuSE, Conectiva, and Turbolinux, and the newly-named SCO Linux 4 came out in November 2002, in conjunction with each of the other vendors releasing their versions of the United Linux 1.0 base. The SCO product was targeted towards the small-to-medium business market, whereas the SuSE product was aimed at the enterprise segment and Conectiva and Turbolinux were intended mostly for the South American and Asian markets. The common United Linux base (which mostly came from a SuSE code origin), and the promise of common certification across all four products, attracted some support from hardware and software vendors such as IBM, HP, Computer Associates, and SAP. An assessment of SCO Linux 4 in &quot;eWeek&quot; found that it was a capable product, although the Webmin configuration tool was seen as limited when compared to YaST, SuSE&#x27;s own operating system configuration tool. In terms of service and support, SCO pledged to field a set of escalation engineers that would only be handling SCO Linux issues.

The new Unix operating system releases then came out. UnixWare 7.1.3 was released in December 2002, which featured improved Java support, the Apache Web Server framework, and improvements to the previously developed Linux Kernel Personality (LKP) for running Linux applications. In particular, the SCO Group stated that due to superior multiprocessor performance and reliability, Linux applications could run better on UnixWare via LKP than they could on native Linux itself, a stance that dated back to Santa Cruz Operation/Caldera International days. One review, that found UnixWare 7.1.3 lacking in a number of other respects, called LKP &quot;the most impressive of UnixWare&#x27;s capabilities&quot;. SCO OpenServer 5.0.7 was released in February 2003; the release emphasized enhanced hardware support, including new graphic, network and HBA device drivers, support for USB 2.0, improved and updated UDI support, and support for several new Intel and Intel-compatible processors.

The SCOx software framework was announced in April 2003; its aim was to enable the SCO developer and reseller community to be able to connect web services and web-based presentation layers to the over 4,000 different applications that ran small and midsize businesses and branch offices. The web services aspect of SCOx included bundled SOAP/XML support for the Java, C, C++, PHP, and Perl languages. A primary target of the SCOx framework was SCOBiz e-commerce integration, although other uses were possible as well. The planned SCOx architecture overall was composed of layers for e-business services, web services, SSL-based security, a mySCO reseller portal, hosting services, and a software development kit.

But by then, these software releases and e-commerce initiatives had become overshadowed by legal actions.

== In the courts ==
=== A focus on intellectual property ===
As soon as McBride became the head of Caldera International, he became interested in what intellectual property the company possessed. He had been a manager at Novell in 1993 when Novell had bought Unix System Laboratories, and all of its Unix assets, including copyrights, trademarks, and licensing contracts, for $335 million. Novell had subsequently sold its Unix business to the Santa Cruz Operation, which had then sold it to Caldera. So in 2002, McBride said he had thought: &quot;In theory, there should be some value to that property – somewhere between a million and a billion [dollars], right? I just wanted to know what real, tangible intellectual property value the company held.&quot; Shortly before the name change to SCO, Caldera went through its existing license agreements, found some that were not being collected upon, and came to arrangements with those licensees representing some $600,000 in annual revenue.

In particular, from the start of his time as CEO, McBride had considered the possibility of claiming ownership of some of the code within Linux. Outgoing Caldera CEO Ransom Love had told him: &quot;Don&#x27;t do it. You don&#x27;t want to take on the entire Linux community.&quot; During the August 2002 name change announcement, Bawa stated: &quot;We own the source to UNIX; it&#x27;s that simple. If we own the source, we are entitled to collect the agreed license fees.&quot; But at the time, McBride said he had no intention of taking on Linux.

By October 2002, McBride had created an internal organization &quot;to formalize the licensing of our intellectual property&quot;; this effort was provisionally called SCO Tech. Senior vice president Chris Sontag was put in charge of it.

By the end of 2002, McBride and SCO had sought out the services of David Boies of the law firm Boies, Schiller and Flexner as part of an effort to litigate against what it saw was unrightful use of its intellectual property. Boies had gained fame in the industry for leading the U.S. federal government&#x27;s successful prosecution of Microsoft in &quot;United States v. Microsoft Corp.&quot;; as McBride subsequently said: &quot;We went for the biggest gun we could find.&quot;

News of the SCO Group&#x27;s intent to take action regarding Linux first broke on January 10, 2003, in a column by technology reporter Maureen O&#x27;Gara of &quot;Linuxgram&quot; that appeared in &quot;Client Server News&quot; and &quot;Linux Business Week&quot;. She wrote that a draft press release concerning SCO&#x27;s plans had been in the works for several weeks and had been quietly circulated to other companies in the industry. The O&#x27;Gara report, unconfirmed as it was, caused some amount of consternation in the Linux community.

On January 22, 2003, creation of the SCOsource division of the company, to manage the licensing of the company&#x27;s Unix-related intellectual property, was officially announced, as was the hiring of Boies to investigate and oversee legal protection of that property. As the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; reported, Linux users had generally assumed that Linux was created independently of Unix proprietary code, and Linux advocates were immediately concerned that SCO was going to ask large companies using Linux to pay SCO licensing fees to avoid a lawsuit. The first announced license program within SCOsource was called SCO System V for Linux, which was a set of shared libraries intended to allow SCO Unix programs to be run legally on Linux without a user needing to license all of SCO OpenServer or UnixWare as had theretofore been necessary.

The company continued to lose money, on revenues of $13.5 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2003, but McBride was enthusiastic about the prospects for the new SCOsource division, telling investors on a February 26 earnings call that he expected it to bring in $10 million alone in the second fiscal quarter.

On March 6, 2003, SCO filed suit against IBM, claiming that the computer giant had misappropriated trade secrets by transferring portions of its Unix-based AIX operating system into Linux, and asked for at least $1 billion in damages. The complaint also alleged breach of contract and tortious interference by IBM against the Santa Cruz Operation for its part in the failed Project Monterey of the late 1990s. Overall, SCO maintained that Linux could not have caught up to &quot;Unix performance standards for complete enterprise functionality&quot; so quickly without coordination by a large company, and that this coordination could have happened through the taking of &quot;methods or concepts&quot; even if not a single line of Unix code appeared within Linux. The &quot;SCO v. IBM&quot; case was underway; it would come to be considered one of the top technology battles of all time.

Many industry analysts were not impressed by the lawsuit, with one saying: &quot;It&#x27;s a fairly end-of-life move for the stockholders and managers of that company [...] This is a way of salvaging value out of the SCO franchise they can&#x27;t get by winning in the marketplace.&quot; Other analysts pointed to the deep legal resources IBM had for any protracted fight in the courts, but McBride professed to be nonplussed: &quot;If it takes a couple of years, we&#x27;re geared to do that.&quot; For his part, Boies said he liked David versus Goliath struggles, and his firm would see a substantial gain out of any victory.

In mid-May 2003, SCO sent a letter to some 1,500 companies, cautioning them that using Linux could put them in legal jeopardy. As part of this, SCO proclaimed that Linux contained substantial amounts of Unix System V source code and that, as such, &quot;We believe that Linux is, in material part, an unauthorized derivative of Unix.&quot; As CNET wrote, the move &quot;dramatically broaden[ed]&quot; the scope of the company&#x27;s legal actions.

At the same time, SCO announced it would stop selling its own SCO Linux product. A casualty of this stance was SCO&#x27;s participation in the United Linux effort, and in turn United Linux itself. While the formal announcement that United Linux had ended did not come until January 2004, in reality the project stopped doing any tangible work soon after SCO filed its lawsuit against IBM.

A few days later, Microsoft which had long expressed disdain for Linux said that it was acquiring a Unix license from SCO, in order to ensure interoperability with its own products and to ward off any questions about rights. The action was a boon to SCO, which to this point had received little support in the industry for its licensing initiative. Another major computer company, Sun Microsystems, bought an additional level of Unix licensing from SCO to add to what it had originally obtained a decade earlier.

On May 28, 2003, Novell counterattacked, saying its sale of the Unix business to the Santa Cruz Operation back in 1995 did &quot;not&quot; include the Unix software copyrights, and thus that the SCO Group&#x27;s legal position was empty. Jack Messman, the CEO of Novell, accused SCO of attempting an extortion plan against Linux users and distributors. Unix has a complex corporate history, with the SCO Group a number of steps removed from the Bell Labs origins of the operating system. Novell and the SCO Group quickly fell into a vocal dispute that revolved around the interpretation of the 1995 asset-transfer agreement between them. That agreement had been uncertain enough at the time that an amendment to it had to be signed in October 1996, and even that was insufficiently unambiguous to now preclude an extended battle between the two companies.

In July 2003, SCO began offering UnixWare licenses for commercial Linux users, stating that &quot;SCO will hold [as] harmless [any] commercial Linux customers that purchase a UnixWare license against any past copyright violations, and for any future use of Linux in a run-only, binary format.&quot;
The server-based licenses were priced at $699 per machine, and if they were to become mandatory for Linux users, would represent a tremendous source of revenue for SCO. The potential for this happening was certainly beneficial to SCO&#x27;s stock price, which during one three-week span in May 2003 tripled in value.

Another counterattack came in August 2003, when &quot;Red Hat, Inc. v. SCO Group, Inc.&quot; was filed by the largest of the Linux distribution companies.

The SCO Group received a major boost in October 2003 when BayStar Capital, a technology-focused venture capital firm, made a $50 million private placement investment in SCO, to be used towards the company&#x27;s legal costs and general product development efforts. In December 2003, SCO sent letters to 1,000 Linux customers that in essence accused them of making illegal use of SCO&#x27;s intellectual property.

Novell continued to insist that it owned the copyrights to Unix. While Novell no longer had a commercial interest in Unix technology itself, it did want to clear the way for Linux, having recently purchased SuSE Linux, the second largest commercial Linux distribution at the time. On January 20, 2004, the SCO Group filed a slander of title suit against Novell, alleging that Novell had exhibited bad faith in denying SCO&#x27;s intellectual property rights to Unix and UnixWare and that Novell had made false statements in an effort to persuade companies and organizations not to do business with SCO. The &quot;SCO v. Novell&quot; court case was underway.

Lawsuits against two Linux end users, &quot;SCO Group, Inc. v. DaimlerChrysler Corp.&quot; and &quot;SCO v. AutoZone&quot; were filed on March 3, 2004. The first alleged that Daimler Chrysler had violated the terms of the Unix software agreement it had with SCO, while the second claimed that AutoZone was running versions of Linux that contained unlicensed source code from SCO. As a strategy this move was met by criticism; as &quot;Computerworld&quot; later sarcastically wrote: &quot;Faced with a skeptical customer base, SCO did what any good business would do to get new customers: sue them for money.&quot;

In any case, the stage was set for the next several years&#x27; worth of court filings, depositions, hearings, interim rulings, and so on.

=== Vultus acquisition and a change in SCOx ===
The SCOsource division got off to a quick start, bringing in $8.8 million during the company&#x27;s second fiscal quarter, which led to the SCO Group turning a profit for the first time in its Caldera-origined history.

In July 2003, the SCO Group announced it had acquired Vultus Inc. for an unspecified price. Vultus was a start-up company, also based in Lindon, Utah, and the Lindon-based Canopy Group was a major investor in Vultus just as it was the SCO Group. Vultus made the WebFace Solution Suite, a web-based application development environment with a set of browser-based user interface elements that provided a richer UI functionality without the need for Java applets or other plug-ins. Indeed, in putting together WebFace, Vultus was a pioneer in AJAX techniques before that term was even coined.

The acquisition of Vultus resulted in a shift of emphasis in the company&#x27;s web services initiative, with an announcement being made in August 2003 at SCO Forum that SCOx would now be a web services-based Application Substrate, featuring a combination of tools and APIs from Vultus&#x27;s WebFace suite and from Ericom Software&#x27;s Host Publisher development framework.

A year later, in September 2004, this idea materialized when the SCOx Web Services Substrate (WSS) was released for UnixWare 7.1.4. Its aim was to give existing SCO customers a way to &quot;webify&quot; their applications via Ericom&#x27;s tool and then make the functionality of those applications available via web services. However, as McBride later conceded, the SCOx WSS failed to gain an audience, and it was largely gone from company mention a year later.

=== Views on infringement claims ===
In the keynote address at its SCO Forum conference in August 2003, held at the MGM Grand Las Vegas, the SCO Group made an expansive defense of its legal actions. Framed by licensed-from-MGM James Bond music and film clips, McBride portrayed SCO as a valiant warrior for the continuance of proprietary software, saying they were in &quot;a huge raging battle around the globe&quot;, that the GNU General Public License that Linux was based on was &quot;about destroying value&quot;, and saying that like Bond, they would be thrown into many battles but come out the victor in the end.

Linux advocates had repeatedly asked SCO to enumerate and show the specific areas of code in Linux that SCO thought were infringing on Unix. An analyst for IDC said that if SCO were more forthcoming on the details, &quot;the whole discussion might take a different tone.&quot; However, SCO was reluctant to show any such code in public, preferring to keep it a strategy that was commonly adopted in intellectual property litigation.

However, during the company&#x27;s Forum conference, SCO did publicly show several alleged examples of illegal copying of copyright code in Linux. Until that time, these examples had only been available to people who signed a non-disclosure agreement, which had prohibited them from revealing the information shown to them. SCO claimed the infringements were divided into four separate categories: literal copying, obfuscation, derivative works, and non-literal transfers. The example used by SCO to demonstrate literal copying became known as the &quot;atemalloc&quot; example. While the name of the original contributor was not revealed by SCO, quick analysis of the code in question pointed to SGI. At this time it was also revealed that the code had already been removed from the Linux kernel, because it duplicated already existing functions.

By early 2004, the small amount of evidence that had been presented publicly was viewed as inconclusive by lawyers and software professionals who were not partisan to either side. As &quot;Businessweek&quot; wrote, &quot;While there are similarities between some code that SCO claims it owns and material in Linux, it&#x27;s not clear to software experts that there&#x27;s a violation.&quot; The legal considerations involved were complex, and resolved around subtleties such as how the notion of derivative works should be applied. Furthermore, Novell&#x27;s argument that it had never transferred copyrights to the Santa Cruz Operation placed a cloud over the SCO Group&#x27;s legal campaign. Most, but not all, industry observers felt that SCO was unlikely to win. &quot;InfoWorld&quot; drily noted that Las Vegas bookmakers were not giving odds on the battle, but the three analysts it polled gave odds of 6-to-4 against SCO, 200-to-1 against SCO, and 6-to-4 for SCO.

In any case, while Linux customers may not have been happy about the concerns and threats that the SCO Group was raising, it was unclear whether that was slowing their adoption of Linux; some business media reports indicated that it was, or that it might, while others indicated that it was not.

=== &quot;The Most Hated Company in Tech&quot; ===
The stakes were high in the battle the SCO Group had started, involving the future of Unix, Linux, and open source software in general. If SCO were to win its legal battles, the results could be extremely disruptive to the IT industry, especially if SCO&#x27;s notion of derivative works were to be construed broadly by the courts. Furthermore a SCO victory would be devastating to the open source movement, especially if the legal validity of the GPL license were to be called into question. Conversely, a clear SCO loss would clarify any intellectual property concerns related to Linux, make corporate IT managers feel more relaxed about adopting Linux as a solution, and potentially bolster corporate enthusiasm for the open source movement as a whole.

Linux advocates were incensed by SCO&#x27;s actions, accusing the company of trying to reap financial gain by sowing fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) about Linux within the industry. Linux creator Linus Torvalds said, &quot;I&#x27;d dearly love to hear exactly &quot;what&quot; they think is infringing, but they haven&#x27;t told anybody. Oh, well. They seem to be more interested in FUD than anything else.&quot; Open source advocate Bruce Perens said of SCO, &quot;They don&#x27;t care who or what they hurt.&quot; Industry analyst and open source advocate Gordon Haff said that SCO had thrown a dirty bomb into the Linux user community.

Many Linux enthusiasts approached the issue with a moralistic fervor.
By August 2003, McBride said that pickets had been seen at SCO offices. McBride tended to compare Linux to Napster in the music world, a comparison that could be understood by people outside the technology industry. The assault on open source produced intense feelings in people; Ralph Yarro, chairman of SCO and head of the Canopy Group, and the person characterized by some as the mastermind behind &quot;SCO v. IBM&quot;, reported that back in his home area in Utah, &quot;I have had friends, good friends, tell me they can&#x27;t believe what we&#x27;re doing.&quot; Internet message boards such as Slashdot saw many outraged postings. The Yahoo! Finance discussion boards, a popular site at the time for investors, were full of messages urging others to sell SCO stock.

SCO suffered a distributed denial-of-service attack against its website in early May 2003, the first of several times the website would be shut down by hackers. One that began in late January 2004 became the most prolonged, when a denial-of-service attack coming out of the Mydoom computer worm prevented access to the codice_1 domain for over a month.

The general IT industry was not pleased with what SCO was doing either. The September 22, 2003 issue of &quot;InfoWorld&quot; had a dual-orientation cover that, if read right side up, had a thumbs-up picture with the text &quot;If SCO Loses&quot;, and if read upside down, had a thumbs-down picture with the text &quot;If SCO Wins&quot;. 
By February of the following year, &quot;Businessweek&quot; was headlining that the SCO Group was &quot;The Most Hated Company In Tech&quot;. A similar characterization was made by the Robert X. Cringely-bylined column in &quot;InfoWorld&quot;, which in March 2004 called SCO &quot;the Most Despised Technology Company&quot;. The cover of a May 2004 issue of &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine had a photograph of McBride accompanied by the large text &quot;Corporate Enemy No. 1&quot;. SCO&#x27;s actions in suing Linux end users was especially responsible for some forms of corporate distaste towards it.

The company that had previously held that title, Microsoft, had by February 2004 spent a reported $12 million on Unix licenses from SCO. The industry giant said the licenses were taken out as part of normal intellectual property compliance for their Windows Services for UNIX product, which provided a Unix compatibility environment for higher-end Windows systems. Linux advocates, however, saw the move as Microsoft looking for a way to fund SCO&#x27;s lawsuits in an attempt to damage Linux, a view that was shared by some other large industry rivals such as Oracle Corporation&#x27;s Larry Ellison. Indeed, Linux advocates had seen Microsoft&#x27;s hand in the SCO Group&#x27;s actions from almost the beginning; as Bruce Perens wrote in May 2003: &quot;Who really benefits from this mess? Microsoft, whose involvement in getting a defeated Unix company to take on the missionary work of spreading FUD [...] about Linux is finally coming to light.&quot; The open source community&#x27;s antipathy towards Microsoft only increased when it became apparent that Microsoft had played at least some role in introducing the SCO Group to BayStar Capital as a potential investment vehicle (both BayStar and Microsoft said there was no stronger role by Microsoft than that).

The distaste for SCO&#x27;s actions seeped into evaluations of SCO&#x27;s product line and technical initiatives as well. &quot;Software Development Times&quot; acknowledged at one point that &quot;many writers in the tech media, which has a pro-open-source, pro-Linux bias, are subtly or overtly hostile to SCO.&quot;
As an instance, in July 2003 a columnist for &quot;Computerworld&quot; examined the SCO Group acquisition of Vultus and concluded that the purpose was not to acquire its technology or staff but rather that Canopy was playing &quot;a shell game [...] to move its companies around&quot; in order to exploit and cash in on the SCO Group&#x27;s rising stock price.
As an analyst for RedMonk stated, &quot;Regardless of the technology they have, there are a lot of enterprises that are going to be ticked off with them. Some of them are receiving these letters (demanding license fees for Linux). There&#x27;s a perception among companies we&#x27;ve spoken to that SCO is really out to get acquired or to make their money off of licensing schemes rather than technologies. That&#x27;s an obstacle to adoption of their products.&quot; This kind of attitude was exemplified by an apologetic review of UnixWare 7.1.3 in &quot;OSNews&quot; in December 2003 that acknowledged that SCO had &quot;earned their now nefarious reputation of pure evil&quot; but that &quot;SCO does actually sell a product&quot; and that the reviewer had to assess it objectively.

Another group of people who found the actions of the SCO Group distasteful were some of those familiar with the Santa Cruz Operation, including those who had worked there and those who had written about it; they became protective of that earlier company&#x27;s reputation, especially given the possible name confusion regarding the two. In an &quot;eWeek&quot; column entitled &quot;SCO: When Bad Things Happen to Good Brands&quot;, technology journalist David Coursey wrote that &quot;SCO was a good company with a good reputation. In some ways, SCO was Linux before Linux, popularizing Unix on low-cost Intel machines [...] It&#x27;s a good brand name that deserves better, or at least a decent burial and a wake. But instead, its memory is being trashed by people who don&#x27;t and maybe can&#x27;t appreciate the fondness many of us still have for the old Santa Cruz Operation.&quot; Science fiction author Charles Stross, who had worked as a tech writer in the original SCO&#x27;s office in England in the early-mid-1990s, called the SCO Group &quot;the brain-eating zombie of the UNIX world&quot; that had done little more than &quot;play merry hell with the Linux community and take a copious metaphorical shit all over my resumé.&quot; More simply, former original SCO employee turned journalist and publisher Sara Isenberg, in writing about the history of tech companies in the Santa Cruz area, wrote about The SCO Group, &quot;I&#x27;ll spare you the sordid legal details, but by then, it was no longer our SCO.&quot;

To be sure, not all former original-SCO employees necessarily felt that way. The company still had developers and other staff at the original Santa Cruz location, as well as at the Murray Hill, New Jersey office that dated back not just to the original SCO but to Novell and Unix System Laboratories and AT&amp;T before that. There was also a development office in Delhi, India, as well as regional offices that in many cases came from original SCO. And in 2006, Santa Cruz Operation co-founder Doug Michels made a return to the SCO Forum stage, with McBride presenting him an award for lifetime achievement.

A major factor in the SCO–Linux battle was the Groklaw website and its author, paralegal Pamela Jones. The site explained in depth the legal principles and procedures that would be involved in the different court giving technology-oriented readers a level of understanding of legal matters they would otherwise not and pulled together in an easily browsed form a massive number of official court documents and filings. Additionally, some Groklaw readers attended the court hearings in person and posted their detailed observations afterward. Accompanying these valuable data points on Groklaw was an interpretative commentary, from both Jones and her readers, that was relentlessly pro-open source and anti-SCO, to the point where journalist Andrew Orlowski of &quot;The Register&quot; pointed out that Groklaw sometimes suffered badly from an online echo chamber effect. In any case, such was Groklaw&#x27;s influence that SCO made thinly veiled accusations that Jones was, in fact, working on behest of IBM, something that she categorically denied. 

The personification of the SCO–Linux battle was no doubt McBride, who was viewed by many as a villain. Columnist Maureen O&#x27;Gara, generally seen as at least somewhat sympathetic to SCO&#x27;s position, characterized McBride as &quot;the most hated man in the computer industry&quot;. McBride acknowledged, &quot;I know people want us to go away, but we are not going to go away. We&#x27;re going to see this through.&quot; The &quot;Sunday New York Times&quot; business section&#x27;s &quot;Executive Life&quot; feature ran a self-profile of McBride in February 2004, in which he reflected upon his no-nonsense father raising him on a ranch and the difficulties of being a Mormon missionary in Japan and later a Novell executive there, and concluded, &quot;I am absolutely driven by people saying I can&#x27;t do something.&quot;
McBride received death threats serious enough to warrant extra security during his public appearances. Asked in May 2004 to reflect upon what the preceding year had been like, McBride said &quot;This is like ... nothing ... nothing compares to what&#x27;s happened in the last year.&quot;

=== Financial aspects ===

SCO&#x27;s legal campaign coincided with the best financial results it would have, when in fiscal 2003 they had revenues of $79 million and a profit of $3.4 million. The campaign was also initially very beneficial to its stock price. The stock had been under $1.50 in December 2002 and reached a high of $22.29 during mid-October 2003. In some cases jumps in the price occurred when stock analysts initiated coverage of the stock and gave optimistic price targets for it.

But the stock began a downward slide soon after that, and by the end of 2003 about a quarter of all outstanding shares were controlled by short sellers. SCOsource revenue was erratic, with the first half of fiscal 2004 being especially poor.
The SCO group had 340 employees worldwide when the lawsuits were first underway in 2003. By a year later, this count had fallen somewhat to 305 employees.

During 2004, SCO and BayStar had a falling out, in part due to the investment firm being unhappy with SCO&#x27;s constant presence in the headlines and the passionate arguments it was involved in with open source advocates, and in part due to the ongoing expenses of running a struggling software products business. Both BayStar and Royal Bank of Canada, which had been part of the initial placement, bought out of the investment by mid-year. Nevertheless, by the calculation of the &quot;Deseret News&quot;, SCO had gained a net $37 million out of the arrangement.

Legal actions were a large expense, costing the SCO Group several million dollars each quarter and hurting financial results. For its third quarter of fiscal 2004, for instance, the company reported revenue of $11.2 million and a loss of $7.4 million, of which $7.2 million was legal expenses. To that point, the company had spent a total of some $15 million on such costs. Accordingly, in August 2004, SCO renegotiated its deal with its lawyers to put into place a cap on legal expenses at $31 million, in return for which Boise, Schiller &amp; Flexner would receive a larger share of any eventual settlement.


McBride continued to come up with new ideas; at the 2004 Forum show he talked about the SCO Marketplace Initiative, which would set up an online exchange where developers could bid on work-for-hire jobs for SCO Unix enhancements that were otherwise not on the SCO product roadmap. Besides helping SCO out, this would set up an alternative to the open source model, one where programmers could &quot;develop-for-fee&quot; rather than &quot;develop-for-free&quot;. McBride ultimately envisioned it becoming &quot;an online distribution engine for business applications from a wide variety [of] companies and solution providers.&quot; The SCO Marketplace began operation a couple of months later, with jobs posted including the writing of device drivers.

The stock slide continued, and by September 2004 had fallen below the $4 level. The company had some 230 employees worldwide at that point. 
During the latter portion of 2004, the California office of the company moved out of Santa Cruz proper, as its longtime 400 Encinal Street office building was mostly empty. The thirty employees still remaining took new space on Scotts Valley Drive in nearby Scotts Valley, California.

By early 2005, the SCO Group was in definite financial trouble. Its court case against IBM did not seem to be going well. Sales for fiscal 2004 dropped by 46 percent compared to the year prior, to less than $43 million, and losses rose by a factor of three to over $16 million. Results for the full fiscal 2004 year were bad: revenues dropped by 46 percent compared to the year prior, falling to around $43 million, and there was a loss on that of over $28 million. The company had to restate three of its quarterly earnings statements due to accounting mistakes and was at risk of being delisted by NASDAQ. During the previous year it had laid off around 100 people, constituting a third of its workforce, and by August 2005 the headcount had fallen to under 200.

The company became independent of The Canopy Group in March 2005, after the settlement of a lawsuit between the Noorda family and Yarro. As part of the settlement, Canopy transferred all of its shares in the SCO Group to Yarro. 
== Products continue ==
=== Company emphasis ===

While there was an industry impression that the SCO Group was far more focused on lawsuits than bringing forward new and improved products, throughout this period, the large majority of SCO employees were not involved with the legal battle but rather were working on software products. This was a point that McBride never hesitated to point out, for instance saying in August 2005 that the company was spending &quot;98 percent of our resources&quot; on new product development, and only two percent on the active cases in court with AutoZone, IBM, and Novell. The idea of the SCO Group becoming a lawsuits-only company had been proposed by BayStar but it was not something McBride wanted to do. Indeed, McBride expressed at least public optimism that the company could survive on its Unix and other product business even if it lost the court cases.

Nevertheless, there were significant challenges in the product space, as operating system revenue had been falling. SCO still had a market presence in some of its traditional strongholds, such as pharmacy chains and fast-food restaurants. But to some extent, the reliability and stability of products such as OpenServer (and the applications they were typically used for) worked against SCO, as customers did not feel an urgent need to upgrade.

UnixWare 7.1.4 was released in June 2004, with major new features including additional hardware support, improved security, and the abovementioned SCOx web services components. A review in &quot;Network World&quot; found that the operating system showed strength in terms of server performance and support for Apache and related open source components, but suffered in terms of hardware discovery and ease of installation. The Linux Kernel Personality (LKP), which had earlier been a major selling point of UnixWare 7, was now removed from the product due to the ongoing legal complications. But UnixWare 7.1.4 did come with the OpenServer Kernel Personality (OKP), which allowed OpenServer-built binary applications to run on the more powerful UnixWare platform without modification, and which had earlier been released as an add-on to UnixWare 7.1.3.

SCO announced a Unix roadmap along with the UnixWare release, intending to convince the market that it was making a strong push in software products. Among the items talked about was Smallfoot, a toolkit for developing customized, small-footprint versions of UnixWare for use as an embedded operating system, and an upgrade to the SCOoffice mail and messaging product. But a constant concern was that SCO had difficulty in attracting independent software vendors to support its operating system platform. Perhaps the biggest such hurdle was the lack of support for current versions of the Oracle Database product. Of the problem in general, a manager at a longtime SCO replicated-site customer, Shoppers Drug Mart in Canada, that was migrating to UnixWare 7.1.4 and was otherwise happy with the product&#x27;s reliability and performance, said: &quot;[Big ISVs] are pushing SCO down to a tier-three vendor. We need a tier-one or a tier-two vendor that will do current ports and certification. We listen to vendors and watch their roadmaps and when SCO disappears that will be a signal [to move on].&quot;

The new SCOoffice release, SCOoffice Server 4.1 for OpenServer 5.0.7, came out in August 2004. SCOoffice consisted of a mixture of proprietary code and open source components and was marketed as a drop-in alternative to Microsoft Exchange Server for small-to-medium businesses, one that would be compatible with Microsoft Outlook (and other common mail clients) but would be less expensive in total cost, be built upon on a more reliable operating system, and have a management interface that could be used by non-technical administrators. Some of the specific technology in the product for interacting with Outlook functions came from Bynari. A review of the SCOoffice technology in &quot;PCQuest&quot; in 2002 found its ease of installation and features to be good and that it was &quot;a decent package for companies looking for a mail server solution.&quot; When originally built by Caldera International, the messaging product had been based on Linux (and UnixWare via LKP), but following the SCO Group&#x27;s legal actions against Linux it was changed to be based on OpenServer instead, with some disruption to the components that could be included within it. The 4.1 release also contained office collaboration tools for meetings, contacts, and the like. SCOoffice was a consistent product for the SCO Group; at least one, and usually more than one, breakout session about it was held at every Forum conference during the SCO Group era.

=== &quot;Legend&quot; ===
By 2005, more than 60 percent of SCO&#x27;s revenue was still coming from its OpenServer product line and associated support services. This was despite the fact that there had been no major releases to the product in the time since the Santa Cruz Operation and Caldera Systems had merged in 2000. Accordingly, the SCO Group devoted a large effort, consisting of extensive research and development as well as associated product management activities, into producing the more modern OpenServer Release 6, code-named &quot;Legend&quot;. After a couple of slips from announced target dates, it was made generally available in June 2005.

The key idea behind Legend was to transplant the UnixWare SVR5 kernel into the OpenServer everything else. This gave OpenServer 6 the ability to support 1TB file sizes, the lack of which had become a major limitation of OpenServer 5. In addition, OpenServer 6 could support up to 32 processors, up to 64GB of RAM, had various new security capabilities such as SSH, an IPFilter-based firewall, and IPsec for secure VPNs, and had faster throughput for applications which could make use of real multiple threading.

The launch event was held on June 22, 2005, at Yankee Stadium in New York City. (This prompted a few industry publication headlines of the &quot;SCO Goes To Bat With OpenServer 6&quot; variety.) Hewlett-Packard noted its support for OpenServer 6 on its ProLiant systems. Some SCO partners were quoted as saying they intended to migrate to it.

While some analysts, such as those for IDS and Quandt Analytics, expressed the belief that the release could help SCO upgrade and hold onto its existing customer base, an analyst for Illuminata Inc. was not so optimistic, saying, &quot;In a word, no. Looked at in isolation, there&#x27;s a lot to like about the new OpenServer. It adds a lot of new capabilities and it finally largely merges the OpenServer and UnixWare trees. But OpenServer is in wild decline – the victim of Windows, Linux and years of SCO mismanagement. Today&#x27;s SCO is a pariah of the IT industry ... OpenServer is a niche product; SCO needs a miracle.&quot;

In practice, despite the good reviews it got from a technical perspective, sales of OpenServer 6 were modest. The company continued to do poorly financially, with fiscal 2005 producing revenues of $36 million and a loss on that of almost $11 million, while fiscal 2006 saw revenues of $29 million together with a loss of over $16 million. Reductions in staff continued and the Scotts Valley office was shut down in late 2006.
=== Mobility and Me Inc. ===
The SCO Group&#x27;s biggest initiative to find a new software business came with what it called Me Inc., first announced at a DEMO conference in California in September 2005.

Me Inc. sought to capitalize on the emergence of smartphones in that it would provide both mobile apps that would run on the phones and an architecture involving a network &quot;edge processor&quot; that would offload processing and storage from the phones themselves and handle authentication, session management, and aggregation of data requests. In such an approach, Me Inc. represented a hosted software as a service (SaaS) offering, with the edge processor representing what would later become referred to as both edge computing and mobile backend as a service. Some of the engineering effort behind Me Inc. came from former Vultus staff, following the failure of the prior SCOx efforts to find a market. Me Inc. initially targeted the Palm Treo line of smartphones. Subsequent support was put into place for the Windows Mobile line of smartphones and some others.

The first services from Me Inc. were Shout, in which users could broadcast text or voice messages from a phone to large groups; Vote, in which users could post surveys to large groups and quickly receive a tally back; and Action, in which users could post tasks for others to do and monitor their statuses. An early user of the Shout service was Utah State University, which used it for broadcasting messages to members of its sports booster organization. Me Inc. services were subsequently used by other Utah organizations as well, including the Utah Jazz, the BYU Cougars, and Mayor of Provo Lewis Billings.

In February 2006, SCO announced that the edge processor had the product name EdgeClick. The development environment for it was branded the EdgeBuilder SDK. In addition, a website codice_2 was announced, that would act as an Internet ecosystem for the development and selling of mobile applications and services. As SCO marketing executive Tim Negris said, the idea of EdgeClickPark was to provide a mechanism for &quot;individuals and organizations of all kinds to participate in developing, selling and using digital services.&quot; Many of these services would come not from SCO itself but from SCO partners, resellers, and ISVs, a channel it was familiar with from the original SCO era. This was reminiscent of McBride&#x27;s goal for the pre-lawsuits SCOBiz and the post-lawsuits SCO Marketplace Initiative, and McBride had similarly large ambitions for Me Inc. and EdgeClickPark, envisioning it having the same role for mobile software that iTunes had at the time for digital music.

McBride, who had been looking at various new business opportunities for SCO to enter, saw the company&#x27;s mobility initiative as something that could become a big success in both the business and consumer spaces, saying &quot;We don&#x27;t know for sure, but we have a little bit of a spark in our eyes that this will be a big deal.&quot; The SCO Group&#x27;s chief technology officer, Sandy Gupta, stated that for the company, &quot;this is clearly a big switch in paradigm.&quot; Industry analysts thought that Me Inc. was aimed at something there was clearly a large market for. As one said, &quot;The operating system market is an increasingly difficult place to compete. SCO Group really does need more diversity [and] these recent pushes represent significant diversification of their product portfolio.&quot; &quot;Software Development Times&quot; commended SCO for coming up with the EdgeClickPark idea, saying that it showed an &quot;interesting flair&quot; in providing a place for partnerships and business development. The company also undertook the proposing of customized mobile applications for various businesses and organizations, using the Me Inc. platform as a starting point.

However, the SCO Group being able to succeed in these efforts faced somewhat long odds, in part due to their being up against many kinds of competition in the mobile space and in part due to the negative feelings about SCO that their campaign against Linux had engendered.
Nevertheless, it was all viewed as a positive development; as &quot;Software Development Times&quot; summarized in a subheading, &quot;Strategy shift to mobile seen as better &#x27;than suing people&#x27;&quot;.

SCO&#x27;s mobility initiative was a main theme of the 2006 instance of its SCO Forum conference, held at The Mirage in Las Vegas. McBride said, &quot;Today is the coming out party for Me Inc. Over the next few years, we want to be a leading provider of mobile application software to the marketplace. ... This is a seminal moment for us.&quot; The Forum 2006 schedule, subtitled &quot;Mobility Everywhere&quot;, held some nineteen different breakout and training sessions related to Me Inc. and EdgeClick, compared to twenty-six sessions for operating system related topics. Eager to drum up interest in the EdgeClick infrastructure and to get developers to attend the 2006 instance of SCO Forum, McBride offered a prize to the developer of the best application built from the EdgeBuilder SDK: a 507-horsepower, V10-engined BMW M5 sports sedan.

One new mobility offering, HipCheck, which allowed the remote monitoring and administration of business-critical servers on smartphones, was given its debut announcement and demonstration at Forum. The HipCheck service, which gave system administrators the ability to conduct secure actions from their phone to correct some kinds of server anomalies or respond to user requests such as resetting passwords, was officially made available in October 2006, with support for monitoring agents running on various levels of Windows and Unix systems. Several upgrades to HipCheck were subsequently made available.

Developed by SCO for FranklinCovey, a Utah-based company that had a line of paper-based planning and organizational products, FCmobilelife was an app for handling personal and organizational task and goal management. (In 2006, SCO had been building a similar app for Day-Timer named DT4, but that collaboration fell through.) In particular, the FCmobilelife app emulated FranklinCovey&#x27;s methodologies for planning and productivity. Initial versions were released for the Windows Mobile and BlackBerry phones; an app for the iPhone was released in mid-2009.

In October 2008, during SCO Tec Forum 2008, the last Forum ever held, the SCO Mobile Server platform was announced, which was a bundling of the Edgeclick server-side functionality and Me Inc. client development kit on top of a UnixWare 7 or Openserver 6 system. By then UnixWare itself, the company&#x27;s flagship product, had not seen a new release in some four years.

In the end, despite the company&#x27;s efforts, the mobile services offerings did not attract that much attention or revenues in the marketplace.

== Life in bankruptcy ==
=== An adverse ruling ===
On August 10, 2007, SCO suffered a major adverse ruling in the &quot;SCO v. Novell&quot; case that rejected SCO&#x27;s claim of ownership of Unix-related copyrights and undermined much of the rest of its overall legal position. Judge Dale A. Kimball of the United States District Court for the District of Utah issued a 102-page summary judgment which found that Novell, not the SCO Group, was the owner of the Unix copyrights; that Novell could force SCO to drop its copyrights-based claims against IBM; and most immediately from a financial perspective, that SCO owed Novell 95 percent of the revenues generated by the licensing of Unix to companies such as Microsoft and Sun. The only SCO claims left intact by Kimball&#x27;s judgment were ones against IBM related to contractual provisions from Project Monterey. As the Utah Valley-based &quot;Daily Herald&quot; newspaper subsequently wrote, Kimball&#x27;s ruling was &quot;a massive legal setback&quot; for SCO.

An appeal was filed. Meanwhile, the company had few options left, as it had not been doing well anyway – by mid-2007, SCO Group stock had fallen to around $1.56 in value – and it now potentially owed Novell more money than it could pay. On September 14, 2008, the SCO Group filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Development work continued on both the operating system and mobility fronts, but selling a technology product while in bankruptcy was challenging. And from this point on, many of SCO&#x27;s actions were dependent upon the approval of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. Annual results for fiscal 2007 showed yet another decline for the company, with revenues falling to $22 million and a loss of nearly $7 million. And because of the bankruptcy filing, SCO was delisted from NASDAQ on December 27, 2007. Downsizing continued, and the New Jersey development office was moved to smaller space in Florham Park, New Jersey in late 2008.

=== Potential buyers ===
The interest of Stephen Norris Capital Partners in the SCO Group started in February 2008, when it put forward a $100 million reorganization and debt financing plan for the company, which it would then take private. Stephen L. Norris had been a co-founder of the large and well-known private equity firm The Carlyle Group. There was also an unnamed Middle East partner in the proposed deal; the Associated Press reported that Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia was involved. 
But after a couple of months of due diligence investigation of SCO&#x27;s operations, finances, and legal situation,
Stephen Norris Capital Partners considered a different course of action, instead proposing to purchase SCO assets outright.
Norris appeared on stage at Forum in October 2008, where possible acquisition and investments plans were shown to attendees.

The company continued to have declining financial performance; the yearly results for fiscal 2008 showed revenues falling to $16 million and a loss of $8.7 million. In January 2009, the SCO Group asked the bankruptcy court to approve a plan wherein its Unix and mobility assets would be put up for public auction. 

That plan did not materialize, and instead in June 2009 a new proposal emerged from a combination of Gulf Capital Partners, of which Stephen Norris was an investor, and MerchantBridge, a London-based, Middle East-focused private equity group, to create an entity called UnXis, which would then buy SCO&#x27;s software business assets for $2.4 million. At that point the SCO Group had fewer than 70 employees left. This latest plan, too, did not move forward.

=== Virtualization ===
The SCO Group&#x27;s last significant engineering effort revolved around capitalizing on a resurgence of industry interest in hardware virtualization. In this case, such virtualization allowed SCO operating systems to run on newer, more powerful hardware even if SCO did not have support or certification for that hardware, and also allowed SCO customers to take advantage of server consolidation and other benefits of a virtual environment. The initial such release, SCO OpenServer 5.0.7V, came out in August 2009, with support for running on VMware ESX/ESXi hypervisors. The technical changes involved included adding enhanced virtual drivers for storage, networking, and peripherals to the operating system as well as tuning its memory management strategies for the virtual environment. 
The virtualization push also included a change in SCO&#x27;s licensing infrastructure, wherein now licensing would be done on an annual subscription basis.

The company said it would make similar &#x27;V&#x27; releases for UnixWare 7.1.4 and OpenServer 6 in the future, but no such releases took place during the SCO Group&#x27;s lifetime. However, support for the Microsoft Hyper-V hypervisor for OpenServer 5.0.7V was added in early 2010.
=== Trustee and trial ===
On August 25, 2009, Edward N. Cahn, a former United States district judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and a counsel for the law firm of Blank Rome, was appointed Chapter 11 trustee for The SCO Group.

In October 2009, a restructuring requested by trustee Cahn led to the termination of McBride and the elimination of the CEO position; the existing COO, Jeff Hunsaker, became the top executive in the company. Perhaps the kindest industry press assessment of McBride&#x27;s tenure came in a column from Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols in &quot;Computerworld&quot;, who wrote, &quot;You have to give McBride credit. While I dislike SCO, he did an amazing job of fighting a hopeless battle. It&#x27;s a pity he was working so hard and so well for such a fundamentally wrong cause.&quot;

SCO had appealed the August 2007 summary judgment against it in &quot;SCO v. Novell&quot; and eventually an appeals court had ruled that a trial had to be held on the issue. A three-week trial was held in March 2010, at the conclusion of which the jury reached a unanimous verdict that the Novell did not transfer the Unix copyrights to the Santa Cruz Operation in 1995. The decision spelled the end for the large majority of the SCO Group&#x27;s legal offensive, leaving only contractual claims against IBM to possibly still pursue.

=== Sale of assets ===
In April 2010, SCO&#x27;s mobility software assets were sold to former CEO McBride for $100,000. In September 2010 the SCO Group finally put up the remainder of its non-lawsuit assets for public auction.
Thus in February 2011, another proposal was made, this time for $600,000, with this iteration of a purchasing company being backed by Norris, MerchantBridge, and Gerson Global Advisors.
The bankruptcy court approved this proposal, as the only other bid submitted was for $18.

The sale was closed on April 11, 2011, with Stephen Norris Capital Partners and MerchantBridge being the final buyers, and UnXis was formed. In particular, UnXis took over the product names, ownership, and maintenance of The SCO Group&#x27;s flagship operating system products, OpenServer and UnixWare. It also took over some service contracts for existing SCO Group customers; these customers represented some 82 countries and business segments such as finance, retail, fast food, and governmental entities. It would be up to UnXis to hire SCO Group employees, of whom, after years of layoffs and attrition, only handfuls were still left at various locations (for instance, at the Lindon, Utah site, only 7 or 8 people still worked, compared with 115 as recently as February 2008).

The SCO Group&#x27;s litigation rights against IBM and Novell did not transfer, as UnXis said it had no involvement or interest in such activities. What was left of The SCO Group renamed itself to The TSG Group.

== Aftermath ==
=== The TSG Group ===
The TSG Group did not have employees &quot;per se&quot;; any at the Utah site not hired by UnXis were let go. The jury trial verdict was appealed, but in August 2011 the U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the verdict and the judge&#x27;s orders following it, thus bringing to a final end &quot;SCO v. Novell&quot;.

However, in November 2011 the bankruptcy trustee decided to go on with the surviving contractual claims against IBM, saying that &quot;the Novell ruling does not impact the viability of the estate&#x27;s claims against IBM.&quot; The &quot;SCO v. IBM&quot; case had previously been closed pending the result of the &quot;SCO v. Novell&quot; case.

Nonetheless, there was no actual business being conducted by the TSG Group, and in August 2012 they filed to convert their status from Chapter 11 reorganization to Chapter 7 liquidation, stating that &quot;there is no reasonable chance of &#x27;rehabilitation&#x27;&quot;.

In June 2013, a judge granted the motion of the brankruptcy trustee and reopened consideration of &quot;SCO v. IBM&quot;. The revived case moved slowly, with a ruling in 2016 being in the favorable direction to IBM, but one in 2017 favorable towards continuing the SCO claims. Industry publications greeted these developments with headlines of the &quot;What is dead may never die&quot; variety.

UnXis changed its name to Xinuos in 2013, and despite &quot;SCO v. IBM&quot; having been reopened in the courts, reiterated that it had no interest in litigation. Instead Xinuos focused on continuing support for UnixWare and OpenServer customers as well as releasing OpenServer 10, a FreeBSD-based product that legacy customers could migrate to.

McBride turned his purchase of SCO&#x27;s mobility assets into a company called Shout TV Inc., which was founded in late 2011 and provided social media engagement for sports fans during live events by offering trivia games and prize contests. By 2015, Shout TV had experienced some success, especially in partnership with the Spanish football club Real Madrid. The assets of Shout TV were transferred to a company known as MMA Global Inc. in 2018.

===Final conclusion of lawsuits===
In August 2021, word came of a possible final settlement in the &quot;SCO v. IBM&quot; case, wherein documents filed in the case indicated that the bankruptcy trustee for TSG Group and IBM appeared to be on the verge of settling the outstanding, Project Monterey-based, claims in the matter for $14.25 million. While the amount was far less than the SCO Group had originally sought when it began the lawsuits, the trustee recommended accepting the settlement, because &quot;ultimate success of the Trustee&#x27;s claims against IBM is uncertain&quot; and that pursuing the matter further would be expensive and that &quot;the Settlement Agreement provides an immediate and substantial monetary recovery and creates important liquidity for the benefit of all creditors and claimants.&quot; As part of this, the trustee would give up any future related claims against IBM. The matter lay with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, which had been handling the case all along.

On November 8, 2021, the settlement was so made under those terms, with IBM paying the TSG bankruptcy trustee $14.25 million and the trustee giving up all future claims and with each party paying their own legal costs. After 18½ years, &quot;SCO v. IBM&quot; was finally over.

As it happened, another suit against IBM was still now active, from Xinuos, which earlier in 2021 had reversed direction from their past disavowals of litigation interest and had filed suit against both IBM and Red Hat, re-alleging old SCO claims about IBM and Project Monterey and alleging new claims that IBM and Red Hat had cornered the operating system market for cloud computing. Unlike the SCO–Linux battles, however, in this case few people in the industry paid the Xinuos action much attention.

In any case, the story of The SCO Group was complete.

== Products ==
* SCO UnixWare, a Unix operating system. UnixWare 2.x and below were direct descendants of Unix System V Release 4.2 and was originally developed by AT&amp;T, Univel, Novell and later on The Santa Cruz Operation.

<text>, (titled Monkey in English, but often referred to as Monkey Magic due to the lyrics of its title music), is a Japanese television drama based on the 16th-century Chinese novel &quot;Journey to the West&quot; by Wu Cheng&#x27;en. Filmed in Northwest China and Inner Mongolia, the show was produced by Nippon TV and and broadcast from 1978 to 1980 on Nippon TV.

==Plot summary==
, the title character, is described in the theme song as being &quot;born from an egg on a mountain top&quot;, a stone egg, and thus he is a stone monkey, a skilled fighter who becomes a brash king of a monkey tribe, who, the song goes on to claim, was &quot;the punkiest monkey that ever popped&quot;. He achieved a little enlightenment, and proclaimed himself &quot;Great Sage, Equal of Heaven&quot;. After demanding the &quot;gift&quot; of a magical staff from a powerful dragon king, and to quiet the din of his rough antics on Earth, Monkey is approached by Heaven to join their host, first in the lowly position of Master of the Stable (manure disposal), and then—after his riotous complaints—as &quot;Keeper of the Peach Garden of Immortality&quot;.

Monkey eats many of the peaches, which have taken millennia to ripen, becomes immortal and runs amok. Having earned the ire of Heaven and being beaten in a challenge by an omniscient, mighty, but benevolent, cloud-dwelling , Monkey is imprisoned for 500 years under a mountain in order to learn patience.

Eventually, Monkey is released by the monk , who has been tasked by the to undertake a pilgrimage from China to India to fetch holy scriptures (implied to be the region of Gandhāra in the song over the closing credits). The pair soon recruit two former members of the Heavenly Host who were cast out and turned from angels to &quot;monsters&quot; as a result of Monkey&#x27;s transgressions: , the water monster and ex-cannibal, expelled from Heaven after his interference caused Heaven&#x27;s precious jade cup to be broken (his birthname is also later revealed to be Shao Chin, having been abducted as a child, but meets his long-lost father, in &quot;The Beginning of Wisdom&quot;), and , a pig monster consumed with lust and gluttony, who was expelled from Heaven after harassing the Star Princess Vega—the Jade Emperor&#x27;s mistress—for a kiss.

A dragon, , who was set free by Guanyin after being sentenced to death, eats Tripitaka&#x27;s horse. On discovering that the horse was tasked with carrying Tripitaka, it assumes the horse&#x27;s shape to carry the monk on his journey. Later in the story he occasionally assumes human form to assist his new master, although he is still always referred to as &quot;Horse&quot;.

Monkey can also change form, for instance into a hornet. In Episode 3, &quot;The Great Journey Begins&quot;, Monkey transforms into a girl to trick Pigsy. Monkey&#x27;s other magic powers include: summoning a cloud upon which he can fly; his use of the magic wishing staff which he can shrink and grow at will and from time to time, when shrunk, store in his ear, and which he uses as a weapon; and the ability to conjure monkey warriors by blowing on hairs plucked from his chest.

The pilgrims face many perils and antagonists both human, such as and supernatural. Monkey, Sandy, and Pigsy are often called upon to battle demons, monsters, and bandits, despite Tripitaka&#x27;s constant call for peace. Many episodes also feature some moral lesson, usually based upon Buddhist and/or Confucianist, Taoist philosophies, which are elucidated by the narrator at the end of various scenes.

==Cast and characters==
== Broadcast history==

Two 26-episode seasons ran in Japan: the first season ran from October 1978 to April 1979, and the second one from November 1979 to May 1980, with screenwriters including Mamoru Sasaki, Isao Okishima, Tetsurō Abe, Kei Tasaka, James Miki, Motomu Furuta, Hiroichi Fuse, Yū Tagami, and Fumio Ishimori.

&quot;Saiyūki&quot; was dubbed into English from 1979, with dialogue written by David Weir. The dubbed version was broadcast under the name &quot;Monkey&quot; and broadcast in the United Kingdom by the British Broadcasting Corporation, in New Zealand by Television New Zealand and in Australia by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Only 39 of the original 52 episodes were originally dubbed and broadcast by the BBC: all 26 of series 1 and 13 of series 2. In 2004, the remaining 13 episodes were dubbed by Fabulous Films Ltd using the original voice acting cast, following a successful release of the English-dubbed series on VHS and DVD; later, these newly dubbed episodes were broadcast by Channel 4 in the UK.

A Spanish-dubbed version of &quot;Monkey&quot; aired in Mexico, Costa Rica, Peru, Argentina, Uruguay and the Dominican Republic in the early 1980s. While the BBC-dubbed &quot;Monkey&quot; never received a broadcast in the United States, the original Japanese-language version, &quot;Saiyūki&quot;, was shown on local Japanese-language television stations in California and Hawaii in the early 1980s. It once aired in China, but it was cancelled after the third episode due to it being criticized for straying too far from the original source material.

Half of series 2 was not originally dubbed into English, but was dubbed later in 2004 with as much of the original cast as possible. The translation and voicing of the subsequent English voice dub is less erudite and humorous than the original effort; and includes some swear words that feel out of place in the context of the original. The voice of Pigsy is slurred in parts - perhaps reflecting the age and health of the voice actor decades later.

== Soundtrack ==
The songs in the series were performed by the five-piece Japanese band Godiego. In Japan, the first series&#x27; ending theme , which was named after the ancient kingdom of Gandhara, was released by Columbia Music Entertainment on 1 October 1978, backed with &quot;Celebration&quot;. This was followed by the release of the opening theme &quot;Monkey Magic&quot; on 25 December 1978, with &quot;A Fool&quot; on the B-side. Godiego also released the soundtrack album &quot;Magic Monkey&quot; on 25 October 1978, comprising all of the songs that the band had composed for the first series.

The album became one of the group&#x27;s highest-charting releases, staying at #1 on the Oricon chart for a total of eight weeks from January through March 1979 (it was unseated for most of January by the Japanese release of &quot;&quot;), and it was ultimately the #1 LP for 1979. For the second series, the ending theme of &quot;Gandhara&quot; was replaced with &quot;Holy and Bright&quot;, which was released on 1 October 1979 (the two sides of the single featured a Japanese-language version on one side and an English-language version on the other).

In the UK, BBC Records released &quot;Gandhara&quot; as a single in 1979 (RESL 66), with both &quot;The Birth of the Odyssey&quot; and &quot;Monkey Magic&quot; on the B-side. The single reached #56 on the UK Singles Chart, eventually spending a total of seven weeks on the chart. A second BBC single was released in 1980 (RESL 81), this time featuring an edited version of &quot;Monkey Magic&quot;, along with &quot;Gandhara&quot; and &quot;Thank You Baby&quot;, but this single failed to chart. The BBC releases of &quot;Gandhara&quot; have one verse sung in Japanese and the other in English. BBC Records also released the &quot;Magic Monkey&quot; album under the simplified title of &quot;Monkey&quot; (REB 384) in 1980 but it failed to chart.

Masaaki Sakai, who plays Monkey in the series, also performed several of the songs for the series: &quot;SONGOKU&quot;, , , a Japanese version of Godiego&#x27;s &quot;Thank You Baby&quot;, and .

==Legacy==
&quot;Monkey&quot; is considered a cult classic in countries where it has been shown, reaching as far as South America. Among the features that have contributed to its cult appeal are the theme song, the dubbed dialogue spoken in a variety of over-the-top &quot;oriental&quot; accents, the reasonably good synchronization of dubbing to the actors&#x27; original dialogue, the memorable battles which were for many Western youngsters their first exposure to Asian-style fantasy action sequences, and the fact that the young male priest Tripitaka is played by a woman.

In 1981, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation debuted the BBC-dubbed &quot;Monkey&quot; at 6pm on week-nights. Since then, the show has been frequently repeated on the ABC, notably during the contemporary youth TV show &quot;Recovery&quot; which aired episodes of &quot;Monkey&quot; weekly from 1996 to 2000. When &quot;Recovery&quot; was put on hiatus, it was replaced with three hours of &quot;Monkey&quot;. The radio station &quot;Triple J&quot; often made references to &quot;Monkey&quot; and interviewed the original BBC voice actors on several occasions.

The British indie-pop band Monkey Swallows the Universe took their name from an episode of &quot;Monkey&quot;.

Newly-launched TV channel &quot;Rewind&quot; on Freeview (UK) channel 95 started showing &quot;Monkey&quot; on Saturdays
from 21 September 2024.

<doc id="236210" wikidata="Q207293" url="?curid=236210" title="Crown prince">
<text>A crown prince or hereditary prince is the heir apparent to the throne in a royal or imperial monarchy. The female form of the title, crown princess, is held by a woman who is heir apparent or is married to the heir apparent.

&quot;Crown prince&quot; as a descriptive term has been used throughout history for the prince who is first-in-line to a throne and is expected to succeed (i.e. the heir apparent), barring any unforeseen future event preventing this. In certain monarchies, a more specific substantive title may be accorded and become associated with the position of heir apparent (e.g. Prince of Wales in the United Kingdom, Prince of Asturias in the Kingdom of Spain and formerly the Dauphin in France). In these monarchies, the term crown prince may be used less often than the substantive title (or never).

Until the late twentieth century, no modern monarchy adopted a system whereby females would be guaranteed to succeed to the throne (i.e. absolute primogeniture). A crown princess would therefore be more likely to refer to the spouse of a crown prince. She would be styled crown princess, not in her own right but by courtesy. Many European countries have now abolished male primogeniture; a notable exception is Spain.

Today, in monarchies lower than royal rank the term &quot;crown prince&quot; is used in English (e.g. Crown Prince of Umm al-Quwain).

==Description==
The term &quot;crown prince&quot; is not used in European monarchies if the hereditary sovereign holds a title below that of king/queen or emperor/empress (such as grand duke or prince), although it is sometimes used as a synonym for heir apparent.

In Europe, where primogeniture governed succession to all monarchies except those of the papacy and Andorra, the eldest son or (more recently) eldest child of the current monarch fills the role of crown prince or princess, depending upon whether females of the dynasty enjoy personal succession rights. Male precedence has been abolished in Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands, as well as in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth realms pursuant to the Succession to the Crown Act 2013. The eldest living child of a monarch is sometimes not the heir apparent or crown prince, because that position can be held by a descendant of a deceased older child who, by &quot;right of representation&quot;, inherits the same place in the line of succession that would be held by the ancestor if he or she were still living (for example, Carl Gustaf, Duke of Jämtland was the crown prince of Sweden from 1950 to 1973, as the senior grandson by male primogeniture of King Gustaf VI Adolf, although the former Prince Sigvard, Duke of Uppland was Gustaf VI Adolf&#x27;s eldest living son, and Prince Bertil, Duke of Halland his eldest living dynastic son during those years).

In some monarchies, those of the Middle East for example, in which primogeniture is not the decisive factor in dynastic succession, a person may not possess the title or status of crown prince by right of birth, but may obtain (and lose) it as a result of an official designation made on some other legal or traditional basis, such as former crown prince Hassan bin Talal of Jordan.

Compare heir apparent and heir presumptive. In Scandinavian kingdoms, the heir presumptive to the crown may hold a different title from an heir apparent: hereditary prince (German: &quot;Erbprinz&quot;, French: &quot;prince héréditaire&quot;). It is also the title borne by the heir apparent of Liechtenstein, as well as the heir apparent or presumptive of Monaco. In Luxembourg, the heir apparent bears the title of hereditary grand duke (German: &quot;Erbgroßherzog&quot;, Luxembourgish: &quot;ierfgroussherzog&quot;); along with hereditary prince, it was also the title borne by the heirs apparent to the thrones of the grand duchies, sovereign duchies and principalities, and of mediatized princely families in the German monarchies abolished in 1918.

==Substantive traditional titles==
Many monarchies use or did use substantive titles for their heirs apparent, often of historical origin:

*Bey Al Mahalla (Kingdom of Tunisia)
*Prince of the Sa&#x27;id (Kingdom of Egypt)
*Dauphin (Kingdom of France)
*Duke of Brabant (Belgium)
*Duke of Braganza (Kingdom of Portugal)
*Duke of Cornwall (Kingdom of England), currently one of the titles of the Prince of Wales
*Duke of Rothesay (Kingdom of Scotland), currently used by the Prince of Wales in place of his Welsh title when in Scotland
*Earl of Carrick (Kingdom of Scotland), currently one of the titles of the Prince of Wales when in Scotland
*Grand Prince (Grand Duchy of Tuscany)
*Lord of the Isles (Kingdom of Scotland), currently one of the titles of the Prince of Wales when in Scotland
*Margrave of Moravia (Kingdom of Bohemia)
*Prince of Asturias (Castile &amp; Spain), also used by heirs presumptive
*Prince of Girona (Aragon &amp; Spain)
*Prince Imperial or Prince Napoléon (French Empire)
*Prince Imperial (Empire of Brazil)
*Prince Imperial (Mexican Empire)
*Prince of Orange (Netherlands), whether or not the equivalent title is held by the spouse of the titleholder is decided by the Dutch parliament (e.g., Queen Máxima of the Netherlands was never titled Princess of Orange by marriage for this reason)
*Prince of Piedmont (Kingdom of Sardinia, and then Kingdom of Italy, when it was alternated with &quot;Prince of Naples&quot;) once conferred by King Joseph Bonaparte
*Prince Royal (France in 1789–1791 and the July Monarchy, and Portugal since 1815)
*Prince of Turnovo (Kingdom of Bulgaria)
*Prince of Viana (Navarre &amp; Spain)
*Rex iunior (Kingdom of Hungary), lit. &quot;junior king&quot; as he was crowned during the life of the incumbent king
*Tsesarevich (Russia)
*Królewicz (Poland)

Some monarchies have used (although not always &quot;de jure&quot;) a territorial title for heirs apparent which, though often perceived as a crown princely title, is not automatically hereditary. It generally requires a specific conferral by the sovereign, which may be withheld.

Current and past titles in this category include:
*Caesar or Kaisar (Roman and early Byzantine Empires) in honor of Gaius Julius Caesar, distinguished from the senior Augustus
*Aetheling (Anglo-Saxon England) and edling (Welsh kingdoms), lit. &quot;of the royal family&quot;
*Duke of Estonia and Lolland (Denmark; during, at least, reigns of Christopher II and Valdemar IV)
*Duke of Valentinois, used by several heirs to the Monégasque throne
*Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester (England, Great Britain, United Kingdom)
*King of the Romans (Holy Roman Empire) – an elective, rather than an inherited title, for the designated successor—usually the son, but sometimes the brother—of the Emperor
*King of Rome (First French Empire)
*Duke of Sparta (Kingdom of Greece); used briefly, &quot;within&quot; Greece, only by Prince Constantine, during the reign of his father, King George I
*Marquess of Baux, used by several heirs to the Monégasque throne
*Prince of Brazil (title of the Portuguese heir from 1645 to 1815)
*Tupoutoʻa (Tonga)
*Duke of Scania (Sweden during the time when Magnus IV of Sweden also was King of Terra Scania)
*Prince of Ani (Kingdom of West Armenia)
*Grand Voivode of Alba Iulia (1930-1940, Kingdom of Romania)
*Grand Voivode of Grahovo (Kingdom of Montenegro)
*Prince of Venice (see Prince Eugène de Beauharnais); for the heir presumptive to Napoleon I in his kingdom of Italy
*Duke of Calabria (Kingdom of Naples and Kingdom of the Two Sicilies); prior to the accession of King Robert the title of the Neapolitan heir was Prince of Salerno
* Pangeran Adipati Anom (House of Mataram)

==Monarchies that use the title of crown prince==
Currently, the following monarchies use the term &quot;crown prince&quot; (or &quot;crown princess&quot;) for the heirs apparent to their thrones:

In addition, the following heirs apparent to deposed monarchies continue to use their former titles by international courtesy:
*Pavlos, Crown Prince of Greece
*Reza Pahlavi, Crown Prince of Iran
*Paras Shah, Crown Prince of Nepal
*Alexander, Crown Prince of Yugoslavia

==Other specific traditions==
In Islamic tradition, the title is the Arabic term Wali al-Ahd.
* In Persia (Iran), during the Pahlavi dynasty and Qajar dynasty, the full style was &quot;Vala Hazrat-i-Humayun Vali Ahd, Shahzada&quot; (given name) (meaning &quot;His August Imperial Highness the Heir Apparent, Prince ...&quot;);
* The title was adopted by many oriental monarchies, even some non-Muslim, e.g. &quot;Walet&quot; as alternative title for the Nepali (Hindu) royal heir apparent; first used by Crown Prince Trailokya in the middle of the nineteenth century, taken from the Mughal title &#x27;Vali Ahd&#x27;

Hindu tradition (Indian subcontinent):
*Yuvaraja was part of the full title in many princely states of India, e.g. in Jammu and Kashmir, the heir apparent was styled &quot;Maharaj Kumar Shri Yuvaraj&quot; (personal name) &quot;Singhji Bahadur&quot;
*Nepal, where the King was styled Maharajadhiraja:
**the heir apparent was styled: &quot;Sri Sri Sri Sri Sri&quot; Yuvarajadhiraj (&#x27;Young King of Kings&#x27;, i.e. Crown Prince) (personal name) &quot;Bir Bikram Shah Deva&quot;;
**the eldest son of the heir apparent was styled: &quot;Sri Sri Sri Sri Sri&quot; Nava Yuvaraj (&#x27;Young Crown Prince&#x27;) (personal name) &quot;Bir Bikram Shah Deva&quot;

East Asian traditions:
*The cognates of Chinese &quot;Huang Taizi&quot; (皇太子, &quot;Great Imperial Son&quot;) – if a son of the reigning emperor, and &quot;Huang Taisun&quot; (皇太孫, Great Imperial Grandson) – if a grandson of the emperor:

*The crown prince of an emperor was sometimes referred as Dong-gong (東宮, &#x27;East Palace&#x27;) due to the location of his residence from the main palace. 
*If the crown prince is the son of a king, he was called 世子 (Shizi).
*The crown prince was not necessarily the first-born son.
*During the Joseon dynasty in Korea, the crown prince was often referred as Dong-gung (동궁, 東宮, &#x27;East Palace&#x27;) or wangseja (王世子 왕세자); The first-born son was called wonja (元子 원자).

Southeast Asian traditions: 
*Siam Makutrajakuman (สยามมกุฎราชกุมาร) in Thailand since 1886.
