<text>An heir presumptive is the person entitled to inherit a throne, peerage, or other hereditary honour, but whose position can be displaced by the birth of a person with a better claim to the position in question. This is in contrast to an heir apparent, whose claim on the position cannot be displaced in this manner.

== Overview ==
Depending on the rules of the monarchy, the heir presumptive might be the daughter of a monarch if males take preference over females and the monarch has no sons, or the senior member of a collateral line if the monarch is childless or the monarch&#x27;s direct descendants cannot inherit either because
#they are daughters and females are completely barred from inheriting
#the monarch&#x27;s children are illegitimate, or
#some other legal disqualification, such as
##being descended from the monarch through a morganatic line or
##the descendant&#x27;s refusal or inability to adopt a religion the monarch is required to profess.

The subsequent birth of a legitimate child to the monarch may displace the former heir presumptive by creating an heir apparent or a more eligible heir presumptive. It is not assumed that the monarch and his or her consort are incapable of producing further children; on the day before Queen Elizabeth II ascended the throne, her father George VI was gravely ill and her mother was 51 years old, but Elizabeth was still the heir presumptive rather than the heir apparent. An heir presumptive&#x27;s position may not even be secure after they ascend their throne, as a posthumous child of the previous monarch could have a superseding claim. Following the death of William IV in 1837, he was succeeded by his niece Queen Victoria, whose accession proclamation noted her accession was only permanent so long as a child of William was not born in the following months to his widow, Adelaide, even though Adelaide was 44 years old and had last been pregnant 17 years earlier. Such a situation occurred in Spain in 1885, when King Alfonso XII died and left behind a widow who was three months pregnant. His five-year-old daughter and heir presumptive, Mar√≠a de las Mercedes, was not declared queen because she would be displaced if a son was born, and instead there was a six-month interregnum until the birth of her brother Alfonso XIII, who assumed the throne as king immediately upon birth. Had the pregnancy been lost or resulted in another daughter, Mercedes would have become queen regnant and been retroactively recognized as such during the interregnum.

Heir presumptive, like heir apparent, is not a title or position &quot;per se&quot;. Rather, it is a general term for a person who holds a certain place in the order of succession. In some monarchies, the heir apparent bears, &quot;ipso facto&quot;, a specific title and rank (e.g., Denmark, Netherlands, United Kingdom), this also sometimes being the case for noble titleholders (e.g., Spain, United Kingdom), but the heir presumptive does not bear that title. In other monarchies (e.g., Monaco, Spain) the first in line to the throne bears a specific title (i.e., &quot;Hereditary Prince/Princess of Monaco&quot;, &quot;Prince/Princess of Asturias&quot;) by right, regardless of whether she or he is heir apparent or heir presumptive.

==Simultaneous heirs presumptive==

In the English and Welsh common law of inheritance, there is no seniority between sisters; where there is no son to inherit, any number of daughters share equally. Therefore, certain hereditary titles can have multiple simultaneous heirs presumptive. Since the title cannot be held by two people simultaneously, two daughters (without a brother) who inherit in this way would do so as co-parceners and before they inherit, both would be heirs presumptive. In these circumstances, the title would in fact be held in abeyance until one person represents the claim of both, or the claim is renounced by one or the other for herself and her heirs, or the abeyance is ended by the Crown. There are special procedures for handling doubtful or disputed cases.

<doc id="238595" wikidata="Q699738" url="?curid=238595" title="Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn">
<text>Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn (Henry Frederick; ‚Äì 18 September 1790) was the sixth child and fourth son of Frederick, Prince of Wales, and Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha, and a younger brother of George III. His 1771 marriage to a commoner against the King&#x27;s wishes prompted the Royal Marriages Act 1772.

==Early life==
Prince Henry was born on 27 October 1745 at Leicester House, London, to Frederick, Prince of Wales, son of George II and Caroline of Ansbach, and his wife Augusta, the Princess of Wales.

==Royal Dukedom==

On 22 October 1766, just prior to his twenty-first birthday, the prince was created Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn and Earl of Dublin. He was Ranger of Windsor Forest and Great Park, from 1766 to 1790. He became a Privy Councillor in 1766 and was appointed Knight of the Garter the following year (1767).

==Allegations==
On 4 March 1767, the Duke of Cumberland allegedly married Olive Wilmot (later Mrs Payne), a commoner, in a secret ceremony. There reportedly was one child, Olivia Wilmot (1772‚Äì1834), from this relationship, though the duke&#x27;s paternity was never proven, and a jury found unanimously that Olivia Wilmot had forged the evidence. A landscape painter and novelist, Olivia Wilmot married John Thomas Serres (1759‚Äì1825) and later, controversially, assumed the title of &quot;Princess Olivia of Cumberland&quot;.

Cumberland&#x27;s mistresses included Ann Elliot who had been an actress before another had taken her off the stage. Cumberland set her up in a house in Greek Street in Soho where she died after an illness in 1769. Cumberland arranged for her burial and memorial and gave a large sum to her estate.

In 1769, the Duke of Cumberland was sued by Lord Grosvenor for &quot;criminal conversation&quot; (that is, adultery) after the Duke and Lady Grosvenor were discovered &quot;in flagrante delicto&quot;. Lord Grosvenor was awarded damages of ¬£10,000, which together with costs amounted to an award of ¬£13,000 ().

==Royal Navy==
In 1768, at the fairly late age of 22, the Duke entered the Royal Navy as a midshipman and was sent to Corsica in HMS &quot;Venus&quot;. However, he returned in September when the ship was recalled following the French invasion of the Corsican Republic. He was promoted to Rear-Admiral the following year and Vice-Admiral in 1770.

==Marriage==
On 2 October 1771, the Duke married Anne Horton (1743‚Äì1808), daughter of Irish peer and British MP Simon Luttrell, 1st Earl of Carhampton (then Lord Irnham) and the widow of Christopher Horton of Catton Hall. The marriage caused a rift with the King, who considered it a mismatch, and was the catalyst for the Royal Marriages Act 1772, which forbade any descendant of George II to marry without the monarch&#x27;s permission.

The marriage between Anne Horton and the Duke of Cumberland was described as a &quot;conquest at Brighthelmstone&quot; (now Brighton) by Mrs. Horton, &quot;who&quot;, Horace Walpole says, &quot;had for many months been dallying with his passion, till she had fixed him to more serious views than he had intended&quot;. Anne was however generally thought one of the great beauties of the age (even Walpole found her green eyes &quot;enchanting&quot;), and Thomas Gainsborough painted her several times.

==Later life==
In 1775, the Duke established the Cumberland Fleet, which would later become the Royal Thames Yacht Club. He was promoted vice-admiral of the White in 1776, admiral of the Blue in 1778, and admiral of the White in 1782, though he was forbidden from assuming any command. The Duke was also instrumental in the development of Brighton as a popular resort. He had first visited in 1771, and in 1783, the Prince of Wales visited his uncle there.

The Duke of Cumberland died in London on 18 September 1790. His widow died in 1808.

<text>A quiet, silent or fanless PC is a personal computer that makes very little or no noise. Common uses for quiet PCs include video editing, sound mixing and home theater PCs, but noise reduction techniques can also be used to greatly reduce the noise from servers. There is currently no standard definition for a &quot;quiet PC&quot;, and the term is generally not used in a business context, but by individuals and the businesses catering to them.

A proposed general definition is that the sound emitted by such PCs should not exceed 30 dBA, but in addition to the average sound pressure level, the frequency spectrum and dynamics of the sound are important in determining if the sound of the computer is noticed. Sounds with a smooth frequency spectrum (lacking audible tonal peaks), and little temporal variation are less likely to be noticed. The character and amount of other noise in the environment also affects how much sound will be noticed or masked, so a computer may be quiet in relation to a particular environment or set of users.

==History==
Prior to about 1975, all computers were typically large industrial/commercial machines, often in a centralized location with a dedicated room-sized cooling system. For these systems, noise was not an important issue.

The first home computers, such as the Commodore 64, were very low power and therefore could run fanless or, like the IBM PC, with a low-speed fan only used to cool the power supply, so noise was seldom an issue.

By the mid-1990s as CPU clock speeds increased above 60¬†MHz, &quot;spot-cooling&quot; was added by means of a fan over the CPU heatsink to blow air onto the processor. Over time, more fans were included to provide spot-cooling in more locations where heat dissipation was needed, including the 3D graphics cards as they grew more powerful. Computer cases increasingly needed to add fans to extract heated air from the case, but unless very carefully designed, this would add more noise.
Energy Star, in 1992, and similar programs led to the widespread adoption of sleep mode among consumer electronics, and the TCO Certified program promoted lower energy consumption. Both added features that allowed systems to only consume as much power as is needed at a particular moment and helped reduce power consumption. In a similar manner the first low-power and energy-conserving CPUs were developed for use in laptops but can be used in any machine to reduce power requirements, and hence noise.

==Causes of noise==
The main causes of PC noise are:
* Mechanical friction generated by disk drives and fan bearings
* Vibration from disk drives and fans
* Air turbulence caused by obstructions in the flow of air 
* Air vortex effects from fan blade edges
* Electrical whine: noise generated by electrical coils or transformers used in power supplies, motherboards, video cards or LCD monitors.

Many of these sources increase with the power of the computer. More or faster transistors use more power, which releases more heat. Increasing the rotation speed of fans to address this will (all things being equal) increase their noise. Similarly, increasing hard disk drives&#x27; and optical disc drives&#x27; rotation speeds increases performance, but generally also vibration and bearing friction.

==Measuring noise==
Though standards do exist for measuring and reporting sound power output by such things as computer components, they are often ignored. Many manufacturers do not give sound power measurements. Some report sound pressure measurements, but those that do often do not specify how sound pressure measurements were taken. Even such basic information as measurement distance is rarely reported. Without knowing how it was measured, it is not possible to verify these claims, and comparisons between such measurements (e.g. for product selection) are meaningless. Comparative reviews, which test several devices under the same conditions, are more useful, but even then, an average sound pressure level is only one factor in determining which components will be perceived as quieter.

==Noise reduction methods==

===Common noise reduction methods===
* Use large, efficient heat sinks
* Incorporate heat pipes, which have much higher effective thermal conductivity than solid copper
* Use fans with lower speeds and larger diameters
* Use fans with low bearing and motor noise
* Rather than constant-speed fans, use thermostatically controlled variable-speed fans that run at less than maximum speed, and thus run quieter most of the time
* Use an efficient power supply to minimize waste heat
* Use quieter models of hard drive
* Use solid state devices like compact flash or solid-state drives rather than traditional mechanical hard drives
* Use remote networked via SMB or NFS rather than local disks
* Place a damping material such as Sorbothane around hard drives or other spinning items
* Use sound insulation material to absorb sound and dampen case resonance
* Water cooling, although difficult to set up, may be useful in some situations

=== Low-cost methods ===
A number of methods exist for reducing computer noise at little or no added cost.
* Reduce CPU supply voltage (&quot;undervolting&quot;). Many of today&#x27;s CPUs can run stably at their stock speed, or even with a slight overclock, at a reduced voltage, which reduces heat output. Power consumption is approximately proportional to &quot;V2¬∑f&quot;, that is, it varies linearly with the clock frequency and quadratically with the voltage. This means that even a small reduction in voltage can have a large effect in power consumption. Undervolting and underclocking can also be used with chipsets and GPUs.
* Enable Cool&#x27;n&#x27;Quiet for AMD CPUs or SpeedStep (also known as EIST) on Intel CPUs.
* Reduce fan speed. For newer computers, the speed of fans can be varied automatically, depending on how hot certain parts of the computer get. Lowering a DC fan motor&#x27;s supply voltage will reduce its speed while making it quieter and lowering the amount of air the fan moves. Doing this arbitrarily could lead to components overheating; therefore, whenever performing hardware work it is advised to monitor the temperature of system components. Fans with Molex connectors can be modified easily. With 3-pin fans, either fixed inline resistors or diodes, or commercial fan controllers can be used. Software like speedfan or Argus Monitor may allow fan speed control. Many newer motherboards support pulse-width modulation (PWM) control, allowing the fan speed to be set in the BIOS or with software.
* Mount fans on anti-vibration mounts.
* Remove restrictive fan grills to allow easier airflow, or replace noisy fan grills with quieter versions.
* Use software such as Nero &quot;DriveSpeed&quot; or &quot;RimhillEx&quot; to reduce the speed of optical drives.
* Isolate hard disk noise, either by using anti-vibration mounts (generally rubber or silicone grommets) or by suspending the hard disk to fully decouple it from the computer chassis by mounting it in a 5.25¬†inch drive bay with viscoelastic polymer mounts.
* Set the hard disk&#x27;s AAM value to its lowest setting. This reduces the seek noise produced by the hard drive but also reduces performance slightly.
* Set operating system to spin down hard drives after a short time of inactivity. This may reduce a drive&#x27;s life span and commonly conflicts with the OS and running programs, though it can still be useful for drives that are only used for data storage.
* Defragment hard drives to reduce the drive heads&#x27; need to search widely for data. This can also improve performance.
* Arrange components and cables to improve airflow. Wires hanging inside the computer can block the airflow, which can increase the temperature. They can be easily moved to the side of the case so that air can pass through more easily.
* Remove dust from inside the computer. Dust on computer parts will retain more heat. Fans draw in dust along with outside air; it can build up quickly inside the computer. Dust can be removed with a vacuum cleaner, gas duster, or compressed air. Special anti-static vacuum cleaners should be used, however, to prevent electrostatic discharge (ESD). Ideally, this would be done often enough to prevent a significant amount of dust from ever building up. How frequently this would need to be performed would depend entirely on the environment in which the computer is used.

In some cases an acceptable solution may be to relocate the too-noisy computer outside the immediate working area and access it either with long-distance HDMI/USB/DVI cables or via remote desktop software from a quiet thin client, e.g. based on a Raspberry Pi, a miniature computer that does not even use a heat sink.

==Individual components in a quiet PC==
The following are notes regarding individual components in quiet PCs.

The motherboard, CPU, and video card are major energy users in a computer. Components that need less power will be easier to cool quietly. A quiet power supply is selected to be efficient while providing enough power for the computer.

===Motherboard===
A motherboard based on a chipset that uses less energy will be easier to cool quietly. Undervolting and underclocking generally require motherboard support, but when available can be used to reduce energy use and heat output, and therefore cooling requirements.

Many modern motherboard chipsets have hot northbridges which may come with active cooling in the form of a small, noisy fan. Some motherboard manufacturers have replaced these fans by incorporating large heat sinks or heatpipe coolers, however they still require good case airflow to remove heat. Motherboard voltage regulators also often have heat sinks and may need airflow to ensure adequate cooling.

Some motherboards can control the fan speed using an integrated hardware monitoring chip (often a function within a Super I/O solution), which can be configured through BIOS or with a system monitoring software like SpeedFan and Argus Monitor, and most recent motherboards have built-in PWM fan control for one or two fans.

Even though a given hardware monitoring chip may be capable of performing fan control, a motherboard manufacturer may not necessarily wire up the fan header pins of the motherboard correctly to the hardware monitoring chip, thus sometimes computer fan control cannot be performed on a given motherboard due to the wiring irregularities, even though the software may indicate that the fan control is available due to the underlying support by the hardware monitoring chip itself. Other times, it may be the case that a single fan-control setting may affect all fan connector headers on the motherboard at the same time, even if individual settings for each fan are available in the hardware monitoring chip itself; these wiring issues being very common makes it difficult to design good general-purpose user interfaces for configuring fan control.

Motherboards can also produce audible electromagnetic noise.

===CPU===
The heat output of a CPU can vary according to its brand and model or, more precisely, its thermal design power (TDP). Intel&#x27;s third revision Pentium¬†4, using the &quot;Prescott&quot; core, was infamous for being one of the hottest-running CPUs on the market. By comparison, AMD&#x27;s Athlon series and the Intel Core¬†2 perform better at lower clock speeds and thus produce less heat.

Modern CPUs often incorporate energy saving systems, such as Cool&#x27;n&#x27;Quiet, LongHaul, and SpeedStep. These reduce the CPU clock speed and core voltage when the processor is idle, thus reducing heat. The heat produced by CPUs can be further reduced by undervolting, underclocking or both.

Most modern mainstream and value CPUs are made with a lower TDP to reduce heat, noise, and power consumption. Intel&#x27;s dual-core Celeron, Pentium, and i3 CPUs generally have a TDP of 35‚Äì54¬†W, while the i5 and i7 are generally 64‚Äì84¬†W (newer versions, such as Haswell) or 95W (older versions, such as Sandy Bridge). Older CPUs such as the Core 2 Duo typically had a TDP of 65¬†W, while the Core 2 Quad CPUs were mostly 65‚Äì95¬†W. AMD&#x27;s Athlon II x2 CPUs were 65¬†W, while the Athlon¬†x4 was 95¬†W. The AMD Phenom ranged from 80¬†W in the x2 variant to 95 and 125¬†W in the quad-core variants. The AMD Bulldozer CPUs range from 95‚Äì125¬†W. AMD APUs range from 65¬†W for the lower-end dual-core variants, such as the A4, to 100¬†W in the higher-end quad-core variants, such as the A8. Some processors come in special low-power versions. For example, Intel&#x27;s lower TDP CPUs end in T (35¬†W) or S (65¬†W).

===Video card===

Video cards can produce a significant amount of heat. A fast GPU may be the largest power consumer in a computer and because of space limitations, video card coolers often use small fans running at high speeds, making them noisy.

Options to reduce noise from this source include:
* Replace the stock cooler with an aftermarket one.
* Use motherboard video output. Typically, motherboard video takes less power but provides lower gaming or HD video decoding performance.
* Select a video card that does not use a fan.
* Most modern graphics cards come with tools that allow the user to reduce the power target and adjust fan curves, resulting in quieter operation at the cost of performance

===Power supply===

Power supply (PSU) is made quieter through the use of higher efficiency (which reduces waste heat and need for airflow), quieter fans, more intelligent fan controllers (ones for which the correlation between temperature and fan speed is more complex than linear), more effective heat sinks, and designs that allow air to flow through with less resistance. For a given power supply size, more efficient supplies such as those certified 80 plus generate less heat.

A power supply of appropriate wattage for the computer is important for high efficiency and minimizing heat. Power supplies are typically less efficient when lightly or heavily loaded. High-wattage power supplies will typically be less efficient when lightly loaded, for instance when the computer is idle or sleeping. Most desktop computers spend most of their time lightly loaded. For example, most desktop PCs draw less than 250 watts at full load, and 200 watts or less is more typical.

Power supplies with thermally controlled fans can be made quieter by providing a cooler and/or less obstructed source of air, and fanless power supplies are available, either with large passive heat sinks or relying on convection or case airflow to dissipate heat. It is also possible to use fanless DC-to-DC power supplies that operate like those in laptops, using an external power brick to supply DC power, which is then converted to appropriate voltages and regulated for use by the computer. These power supplies usually have lower wattage ratings.

The electrical coils in power supplies can produce audible electromagnetic noise which can become noticeable in a quiet PC.

Equipping the PSU with a power cord that uses a ferrite bead can sometimes help to reduce humming from the PSU.

===Case===

Case designed for low noise usually include quiet fans, and often come with a quiet power supply. Some incorporate heatsinks to cool components passively.

Larger cases provide more space for airflow, larger coolers and heat sinks, and sound-dampening material.

====Airflow====
Noise-optimized cases often have ducting and partitioning within the case to optimize airflow and to thermally isolate components. Vents and ducts may easily be added to regular cases.

Case designed to be quiet typically have wire grills or honeycombed fan grills. Both are far superior to the older style of stamped grill.

Features that facilitate neat cable management, such as brackets and space to run cables behind the motherboard tray, help increase cooling efficiency.

Air filters can help to prevent dust from coating heat sinks and surfaces, which dust impedes heat transfer, making fans spin faster. However, the filter itself can increase noise if it restricts airflow too much or is not kept clean, requiring a larger or faster fan to handle the pressure drop behind the filter.

====Soundproofing====
The inside of a case can be lined with dampening materials to reduce noise by:
* attenuating the vibration of the case panels via extensional damping or constrained-layer damping
* reducing the amplitude of the vibration of the case panels by increasing their mass
* absorbing airborne noise, such as with foam

===Cooling systems===
====Heat sink====

Large heat sinks designed to operate efficiently with little airflow are often used in quiet computers. Often heat pipes are used to more efficiently distribute heat to the heat sink.

====Fan====

If they use fans at all, quiet PCs typically use larger-than-usual low-speed fans with quiet-running motors and bearings. The 120¬†mm size is common, and 140¬†mm fans are used where cases or heat sinks allow them. Quiet fan manufacturers include Nexus, EBM-Papst, Yate Loon, Scythe, and Noctua. Extensive comparative surveys have been posted by SPCR and MadShrimps.

Fan noise is often proportional to fan speed, so fan controllers can be used to slow down fans and to precisely choose fan speed. Fan controllers can produce a fixed fan speed using an inline resistor or diode; or a variable speed using a potentiometer to supply a lower voltage. Fan speed can also be reduced more crudely by plugging them into the power supply&#x27;s 5-volt line instead of the 12-volt line (or between the two for a potential difference of 7 volts, although this cripples the fan&#x27;s speed sensing). Most fans will run at 5 volts once they are spinning, but may not start reliably at less than 7 V. Some simple fan controllers will only vary the fans&#x27; supply voltage between 8 V and 12 V to avoid this problem entirely. Some fan controllers start the fan at 12 V, then drop the voltage after a few seconds.

PWM fan control, however, is the easiest and most efficient option for modern motherboards that have PWM fan headers. PWM fan control rapidly cycles between feeding the fan full voltage and no voltage, to control rotational speed. Typically the motherboard chipset provides temperature data from sensors on the CPU itself to control speed.

Bearing and motor noise is an important consideration. Soft mounting fans (e.g. with rubber or silicone fan isolators) can help reduce transfer of fan vibration to other components.

Piezoelectric fans are often quieter than rotating fans and may consume less power. Intel, Murata, and others have recently done development on use of piezoelectric fans in desktop PCs.

====Watercooling====

Watercooling is a method of heat-dissipation by transferring the heat through a conductive material which is in contact with a liquid, such as demineralized water with an additive to prevent bacterial growth. This water travels in a loop that usually contains a reservoir, radiator and pump. Modern 12 V DC pump technologies allow extremely powerful and quiet designs.

By efficiently transferring device heat to a separate heat exchanger that can use larger heat sinks or fans, water cooling can allow quieter overall operation. Devices such as GPUs, Northbridges, Southbridges, hard disk drives, memory, voltage regulator modules (VRMs), and even power supplies can be separately watercooled; in fact the whole PC can be immersed, in some cases.

===Secondary storage===

====Hard drive====
Older hard drives used ball bearing motors but more recent desktop hard drives use quieter fluid bearing motors.

The smaller 2.5&quot; form-factor hard drives generally vibrate less, are quieter, and use less power than traditional 3.5&quot; drives, but often have lower performance and less capacity, and cost more per gigabyte.

To minimize vibrations from a hard drive being transferred to, and amplified by the case. Hard drives can be mounted with soft rubber studs, suspended with elastics, or placed on soft foam or Sorbothane. Hard disk enclosures can also help reduce drive noise, but care must be taken to ensure that the drive gets adequate cooling - with disk temperatures often monitored by SMART software.

====Solid-state storage====

A solid-state drive has no moving mechanical components and runs silently, but () are still roughly four times more expensive per unit of storage than consumer-grade HDDs.

In some cases, other solid-state storage methods may be suitable:
* Compact Flash (CF) cards can be used as secondary storage. Because they use a slightly modified Parallel ATA (PATA) interface, a simple adapter is all that is needed to connect CF cards to function as an PATA or PC Card hard disk. CF cards are also small, allowing SFF PCs to be made, produce no noise, use very little power (further reducing heat output in the AC/DC conversion in the PSU), and an insignificant amount of heat. However, they are very expensive per GB and are only available in small capacities and there are also issues regarding the maximum number of writes to each sector.
* USB flash drives can be used if a motherboard supports booting from USB. They are based on flash memory, so have the same advantages and disadvantages as CF cards, except that speed is limited by the USB bus.
* i-RAM is a solid-state disk that has four DIMM slots to allow regular PC RAM to be used like a disk. It is much faster than a hard disk, does not have the write cycle limitations of flash memory, however, it requires power continuously in order to maintain its contents (from standby power or a battery when the system is off), uses more power than many laptop hard drives, has maximum capacity of 4 GiB, and is expensive.

All forms of solid-state storage are more expensive than traditional spinning-disk drives, so some quiet PC designs use them in conjunction with a secondary hard drive which is only accessed when needed, or with network-attached storage, where less-quiet traditional hard drives are kept remote.

====Optical drive====
Optical drives can be slowed down by software to quiet them, such as Nero DriveSpeed, or emulated by virtual drive programs such as Daemon Tools to eliminate their noise entirely. Notebook optical drives can be used, which tend to be quieter, however, this may be because they tend to run slower (typically 24√ó CD speed, 8√ó DVD speed). Some DVD drives have a feature, commonly called Riplock, which reduces drive noise by slowing the drive during video playback. For playback operations, only 1x (real time) speed is required.

===External components===

====Monitor====

A CRT monitor can produce coil noise, as can the external power supply for an LCD monitor or the voltage converter for the monitor&#x27;s backlight. LCD monitors tend to produce the least noise (whine) when at full brightness. Reducing brightness using the video card does not introduce whine but may reduce color accuracy. An LCD monitor with an external power supply tucked out of the way will produce less noticeable noise than one with the power supply built into the screen housing.

====Printer====

In the past, particularly noisy printers such as dot matrix and daisy wheel designs were often housed in soundproofed boxes or cabinets, and the same technique can be used with modern printers to reduce their perceived noise. Another solution is to network the printer and locate it physically away from the immediate work area.

==Laptop==

In contrast to desktop PCs, laptops and notebooks typically do not have power supply fans or video card fans and generally use physically smaller hard drives and lower-power components. However, laptop CPU fans are usually smaller, so may not necessarily be quieter than their desktop counterparts - a smaller fan area requires faster fan speeds to move the same amount of air. Furthermore, limited space, limited access and proprietary components make silencing them more difficult.

===Fanless===
A number of laptops and netbooks however do not use cooling fans at all.

Fanless portable computers (tablet pcs, subnotebooks, chromebooks, ultrabooks and 2-in-1 PCs) running under 10-15¬†W on mobile CPUs (most commonly ARM processors) became popular after netbooks but then mainly after the introduction of the first iPad in 2010. The first iPad&#x27;s CPU, the ARM Cortex-A8 was the first Cortex design to be adopted on a large scale in consumer devices.

<doc id="238604" wikidata="Q1140097" url="?curid=238604" title="A/UX">
<text>A/UX is a Unix-based operating system from Apple Computer for Macintosh computers, integrated with System 7&#x27;s graphical interface and application compatibility. It is Apple&#x27;s first official Unix-based operating system, launched in 1988 and discontinued in 1995 with version 3.1.1. A/UX requires select 68k-based Macintosh models with an FPU and a paged memory management unit (PMMU), including the Macintosh II, SE/30, Quadra, and Centris series.

Its foundation is UNIX System V Release 2.2, with features from Releases 3 and 4 and from BSD versions 4.2 and 4.3. It is compliant with POSIX and System V Interface Definition (SVID), and includes TCP/IP networking since version 2. Having a Unix-compatible, POSIX-compliant operating system enabled Apple to bid for large contracts to supply computers to the U.S. federal government.

A/UX was described by &quot;MacUser&quot; as &quot;the most interesting and impressive software to have come out of Apple since HyperCard&quot; and by &quot;InfoWorld&quot; as &quot;an open systems solution with the Macintosh at its heart&quot;.

==Features==
A/UX has a graphical user interface (GUI) including the familiar Finder windows, menus, and controls. The A/UX Finder is a customized version of the System 7 Finder, adapted to run as a Unix process and to interact with the underlying Unix file systems. CommandShell is a GUI for the underlying Unix command-line interface. An X Window System server (called MacX) with a terminal program can interface with the system and run X applications alongside Finder. Alternatively, a fullscreen X11R4 session can run without Finder.

Apple&#x27;s compatibility layer allows A/UX to run applications for Macintosh System 7.0.1, Unix, and hybrids of both. For example, a Macintosh application can call Unix system functions, or a Unix application can call Macintosh Toolbox functions (such as QuickDraw), or a HyperCard stack can be a graphical frontend for a command-line Unix application. A/UX&#x27;s compatibility layer uses some existing Toolbox functions in the computer&#x27;s ROM, and other function calls are translated into native Unix system calls; and it cooperatively multitasks all Macintosh apps in a single address space by using a token-passing system for their access to the Toolbox.

The Commando utility assists users with entering Unix commands, resembling the one in Macintosh Programmer&#x27;s Workshop. Opening a Unix executable file from Finder opens a dialog box that allows the user to choose command-line options for the program using standard controls such as radio buttons and check boxes, and display the resulting command line argument for the user before executing the command or program. This feature is intended to ease the learning curve for users new to Unix, and decrease the user&#x27;s reliance on the Unix manual. A/UX has a utility that allows the user to reformat third-party SCSI drives in such a way that they can be used in other Macs of that era.

A/UX requires 68k-based Macintoshes with a floating point unit (FPU) and a paged memory management unit (PMMU), and select models. For example, the Quadra 840AV, the fastest 68k Macintosh, cannot run A/UX.

==History==
A/UX 1.0 was announced at the February 1988 Uniforum conference, seven months behind schedule. It is based on AT&amp;T&#x27;s Unix System V.2.2 with additional features from BSD Unix. Networking support includes TCP/IP, AppleTalk, and NFS implementations, developed by UniSoft. The base system has no GUI, with only the command line. It can run one Macintosh application at a time, using the System 6 GUI interface, although it is compatible with only about 10% of the existing Macintosh software library.

It was initially aimed at existing Unix customers, universities and VARs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apple breaks into Unix market with A/UX&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The system was initially sold pre-installed on the Macintosh II for , a larger monitor could be added, or a kit could upgrade an existing Mac II for a lower price. Third-party software announced with the system&#x27;s first release includes the Ingres database, StatView, developer tools, and various productivity software packages.

A/UX 1.1 was released in 1989, and supplies the basic GUI of System 6, with Finder, Chooser, Desk Accessories, and Control Panels. It provisions Unix with the X Window System (X11R3) GUI, the Draft 12 POSIX standard, and overall improved speed comparable to a low end Sun workstation.&lt;ref name=&quot;A/UX, Release 1.1 Supports X Window&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Having its first POSIX compliant platform allowed Apple to join &quot;a growing list of industry heavyweights&quot; to be allowed into the US federal government&#x27;s burgeoning $6 billion bid market.

A/UX 2.0 was released in mid-1990, adding support for simultaneously windowed applications for Macintosh, Unix, and X Window upon the desktop. &quot;MacUser&quot; said that after months of lab testing, A/UX &quot;easily meets or exceeds nearly all our expectations. [...] A/UX 2.0 is, on the whole, a superb combination of the Mac and UNIX System V 2.2 and 4.3 BSD extensions [...] A/UX is the most interesting and impressive software to have come out of Apple since HyperCard. A/UX 2.0 is not just great UNIX software - it&#x27;s great Macintosh software.&quot; The review considered system performance adequate except maybe for heavy use of CAD and compilers, even on the fastest Macintosh IIfx which has less UNIX speed than the average workstation like a SPARCstation 1+.

In 1991, Apple&#x27;s plans were influenced by the new AIM alliance with IBM, envisioning that A/UX should become the basis for drastically scaling the Macintosh system architecture and application compatibility across the computing industry, from personal to enterprise markets. Apple formed a new business division for enterprise systems, led by director Jim Groff to serve &quot;large businesses, government, and higher education&quot;. Basing the division upon a maturing A/UX, Groff admitted that Apple was &quot;not a major player&quot; in the Unix market and had performed merely &quot;quiet&quot; marketing of the operating system, but fully intended to become a &quot;major player&quot; with &quot;very broad-based marketing objectives&quot; in 1992. Further, Apple believed the alliance with IBM would merge A/UX, AIX, and System 7 into one platform‚Äîthus ultimately scaling Macintosh applications from Mac desktops to huge IBM RS/6000 systems.

In November 1991, Apple launched A/UX 3.0, planning to synchronize the two concurrent release schedules of A/UX and System 7. At that time, the company also preannounced A/UX 4.0, expected for release in 1993 or 1994. The announcement expounded about AIM and its platform merger proposal, and about allowing AIM to enter what Apple believed to be an emerging &quot;general desktop open systems market&quot;. A/UX 3.0 was positioned as an &quot;important migration path&quot; to this new system, making Unix and System 7 applications compliant with the PowerOpen specification. A/UX 4.0 was proposed to target the PowerOpen Environment ABI, merge AIX features into A/UX, and use the OSF/1 kernel from the Open Software Foundation. The future A/UX 4.0 and future AIX versions were intended for a variety of IBM&#x27;s POWER and PowerPC hardware, and on Apple&#x27;s PowerPC hardware.

In April 1992, a C2-level secure version of A/UX was released. Coincidentally, the AIM alliance had launched the Apple/IBM partnership Taligent Inc. one month earlier, with the mission of bringing Apple&#x27;s other next-generation operating system Pink to market as a grandly universal operating system and application framework.

Contrary to all announcements, Apple eventually canceled A/UX 4.0. In 1995, PowerOpen was discontinued and Apple withdrew from the Taligent Inc. partnership in December. In 1996, Apple discontinued its Copland project which had spent two years in the public view, intended to become Mac OS 8 and to host Taligent software. From 1996 to 1997, the company deployed a short-lived platform of Apple Network Server systems based on PowerPC and a customized AIX. Apple&#x27;s serially failed operating system strategy yielded no successor to the badly aged System 7. Apple acquired NeXT in 1996 and introduced Mac OS X Server 1.0 in 1999, which merged Mac OS 8 upon the Unix-based NeXTSTEP operating system.

The final release of A/UX is version 3.1.1 of 1995. Apple had abandoned A/UX completely by 1996.

==Reception==
A/UX 1.0 was criticized in the April 1988 &quot;InfoWorld&quot; review for having a largely command line interface as in other Unix variants, rather than graphical as in System 6. Its networking support was praised. &quot;BYTE&quot; in 1989 listed A/UX 1.1 among the &quot;Excellence&quot; winners of the &quot;BYTE&quot; Awards, stating that it &quot;could make Unix the multitasking operating system of choice during the next decade&quot; and challenge OS/2. Compared to contemporary workstations from other Unix vendors, however, the Macintosh hardware lacks features such as demand paging. The first two versions A/UX consequently suffered poor performance, and poor sales. Users also complained about the amount of hard drive space it uses on a standard Macintosh, though comparable to any Unix system.

A/UX 3.0 was praised in the August 1992 issue of &quot;InfoWorld&quot; by the same author, describing it as &quot;an open systems solution with the Macintosh at its heart&quot; where &quot;Apple finally gets Unix right&quot;. He praised the GUI, single-button point-and-click installer, one year of personal tech support, the graphical help dialogs, and the user&#x27;s manuals, saying that A/UX &quot;defies the stereotype that Unix is difficult to use&quot; and is &quot;the easiest version of Unix to learn&quot;. Its list price of is much higher than that of &quot;much weaker&quot; competing PC operating systems such as System 7, OS/2, MS-DOS, and Windows 3.1, but low compared to the then prevailing proprietary Unix licenses of more than . The review found the system speed &quot;acceptable but not great&quot; even on the fastest Quadra 950, blaming not the software but the incomplete Unix optimization found in Apple&#x27;s hardware. Though &quot;a very good value&quot;, the system&#x27;s price-performance ratio was judged as altogether uncompetitive against Sun&#x27;s SPARCstation 2. The reviewers thought it unlikely for users &quot;to want to buy Macs just to run A/UX&quot; and would have awarded &quot;InfoWorld&quot;‚Ä≥s top score if the OS was not proprietary to Macintosh hardware.

Tony Bove of the &quot;Bove &amp; Rhodes Report&quot; generally complained that &quot;[f]or Unix super-users there is no compelling reason to buy Apple&#x27;s Unix. For Apple, A/UX has always been a way to sell Macs, not Unix; it&#x27;s a check-off item for users.&quot;

===Legacy===
Vintage A/UX users had one central repository for most A/UX applications: an Internet server at NASA called Jagubox. It was administered by Jim Jagielski, who was also the editor of the A/UX FAQ.

<text>are a class of supernatural entities and spirits in Japanese folklore. The kanji representation of the word comprises two characters that both mean &quot;suspicious, doubtful&quot;, and while the Japanese name is simply the Japanese transliteration or pronunciation of the Chinese term &quot;yaoguai&quot; (which designates similarly strange creatures), some Japanese commentators argue that the word &quot;y≈çkai&quot; has taken on multiple different meanings particular to a Japanese context, including referring to a large number of uniquely Japanese creatures. 

 are also referred to as , or . However, most Japanese generally think of the two loose classes of spirits as highly different, although some academics and Shinto practitioners acknowledge similarities within the seeming dichotomy between the natures of them and most &quot;kami&quot;, which are generally regarded as relatively beneficent in comparison, and class the two as ultimately the same type of spirits of nature or of a mythological realm.
Their behavior can range from malevolent or mischievous to benevolent to humans.

 often have animal-like features (such as the , depicted as appearing similar to a turtle, and the , commonly depicted with wings), but may also appear humanoid in appearance, such as the (Âè£Ë£Ç„ÅëÂ•≥). Some resemble inanimate objects (such as the ), while others have no discernible shape. are typically described as having spiritual or supernatural abilities, with shapeshifting being the most common trait associated with them. that shapeshift are known as or .

Japanese folklorists and historians explain as personifications of &quot;supernatural or unaccountable phenomena to their informants&quot;. In the Edo period (1603 to 1868), many artists, such as Toriyama Sekien (1712-1788), invented new by taking inspiration from folk-tales or purely from their own imagination. Today, several such (such as the ) are mistakenly thought to originate in more traditional folklore.

==Concept==
The concept of , their causes and phenomena related to them varies greatly throughout Japanese culture and historical periods; typically, the older the time period, the higher the number of phenomena deemed to be supernatural and the result of . According to Japanese ideas of animism, spirit-like entities were believed to reside in all things, including natural phenomena and objects. Such spirits possessed emotions and personalities: peaceful spirits were known as , who brought good fortune; violent spirits, known as , brought ill fortune, such as illness and natural disasters. Neither type of spirit was considered to be .

One&#x27;s ancestors and particularly respected departed elders could also be deemed to be , accruing status as protective spirits who brought fortune to those who worshipped them. Animals, objects and natural features or phenomena were also venerated as or propitiated as depending on the area.

Despite the existence of harmful spirits, rituals for converting into were performed, aiming to quell malevolent spirits, prevent misfortune and alleviate the fear arising from phenomena and events that otherwise had no explanation. The ritual for converting into was known as the . rituals for that failed to achieve deification as benevolent spirits, whether through a lack of sufficient veneration or through losing worshippers and thus their divinity, became .

Over time, phenomena and events thought to be supernatural became fewer and fewer, with the depictions of in picture scrolls and paintings beginning to standardize, evolving more into caricatures than fearsome spiritual entities. Elements of the tales and legends surrounding began to be depicted in public entertainment, beginning as early as the Middle Ages in Japan. During and following the Edo period, the mythology and lore of became more defined and formalized.

==Types==
The folklorist Tsutomu Ema studied the literature and paintings depicting and , dividing them into categories as presented in the and the :
* Categories based on a &#x27;s &quot;true form&quot;:
** Human
** Animal
** Plant
** Object
** Natural phenomenon
* Categories depending on the source of mutation:
** Mutation related to this world
** Spiritual or mentally related mutation
** Reincarnation or afterworld related mutation
** Material related mutation
* Categories based on external appearance:
** Human
** Animal
** Plant
** Artifact
** Structure or building
** Natural object or phenomenon
** Miscellaneous or appearance compounding more than one category

In other folklorist categorizations, are classified, similarly to the nymphs of Greek mythology, by their location or the phenomena associated with their manifestation. are indexed in the book as follows:
* (mountains)
* (paths)
* (trees)
* (water)
* (the sea)
* (snow)
* (sound)
* (animals, either real or imaginary)

==History==

===Ancient history===
* 772 CE: in the , there is the statement &quot;Shinto purification is performed because appear very often in the imperial court&quot;, using the word to not refer to any one phenomenon in particular, but to strange phenomena in general.
* Middle of the Heian period (794‚Äì1185/1192): In &quot;The Pillow Book&quot; by Sei Sh≈çnagon, there is the statement &quot;there are tenacious &quot;, as well as a statement by Murasaki Shikibu that &quot;the have become quite dreadful&quot;, which are the first appearances of the word .
* 1370: In the , in the fifth volume, there is the statement, &quot;Sagami no Nyudo was not at all frightened by .&quot;

The ancient times were a period abundant in literature and folktales mentioning and explaining . Literature such as the , the , and various expositioned on legends from the ancient past, and mentions of , , among other kinds of mysterious phenomena can already be seen in them. In the Heian period, collections of stories about and other supernatural phenomena were published in multiple volumes, starting with publications such as the and the , and in these publications, mentions of phenomena such as can be seen.

The that appear in this literature were passed on to later generations. Despite the literature mentioning and explaining these , they were never given any visual depictions. In Buddhist paintings such as the Hell Scroll (Nara National Museum), which came from the later Heian period, there are visual expressions of the idea of , but actual visual depictions would only come later in the Middle Ages, from the Kamakura period and beyond.

Yamata no Orochi was originally a local god but turned into a who was slain by Susanoo. Yasaburo was originally a bandit whose vengeful spirit () turned into a poisonous snake upon death and plagued the water in a paddy, but eventually became deified as the &quot;wisdom god of the well&quot;. and are sometimes treated as gods in one area and in other areas. From these examples, it can be seen that among Japanese gods, there are some beings that can go from god to and vice versa.

===Post-classical history===

Medieval Japan was a time period where publications such as , , and other visual depictions of started to appear. While there were religious publications such as the , others, such as the , were intended more for entertainment, starting the trend where became more and more seen as subjects of entertainment. For examples, tales of extermination could be said to be a result of emphasizing the superior status of human society over . Publications included:
* The (about an ), the (about a ), the (concerning serpent/dragon-folk oppressed by a giant centipede &quot;y≈çkai&quot;), the (about ), and the (about a giant snake). These were about that come from even older times.
* The , in which Sugawara no Michizane was a lightning god who took on the form of an , and despite attacking people after doing this, he was still deified as a god in the end.
* The , the , (both about Tamamo-no-Mae), and the (about a monkey). These told of mutations of animals.
* The , which told tales of thrown away none-too-precious objects that come to have a spirit residing in them planning evil deeds against humans, and ultimately get exorcised and sent to peace.
* The , depicting many different kinds of all marching together
In this way, that were mentioned only in writing were given a visual appearance in the Middle Ages. In the , familiar tales such as Urashima Tar≈ç and Issun-b≈çshi also appeared.

The next major change in came after the period of warring states, in the Edo period.

===Modern history===
==== Edo period ====
* 1677: Publication of the , a collection of tales of various monsters.
* 1706: Publication of the . In volumes such as (volume 1) and (volume 4), collections of tales that seem to come from China were adapted into a Japanese setting.
* 1712: Publication of the by Terajima Ry≈çan, a collection of tales based on the Chinese .
* 1716: In the specialized dictionary , there is an entry on , which stated, &quot;Among the commoners in my society, there are many kinds of (mysterious phenomena), often mispronounced by commoners as Types include the cry of weasels, the howling of foxes, the bustling of mice, the rising of the chicken, the cry of the birds, the pooping of the birds on clothing, and sounds similar to voices that come from cauldrons and bottles. These types of things appear in the , methods of exorcising them can be seen, so it should serve as a basis.&quot;
* 1788: Publication of the by Masayoshi Kitao. This was a diagram book of , but it was prefaced with the statement &quot;it can be said that the so-called in our society is a representation of our feelings that arise from fear&quot;, and already in this era, while were being researched, it indicated that there were people who questioned whether really existed or not.

It was in this era that the technology of the printing press and publication was first started to be widely used, that a publishing culture developed, and was frequently a subject of and other publications.

As a result, shops that handled such books spread and became widely used, making the general public&#x27;s impression of each fixed, spreading throughout Japan. For example, before the Edo period, there were plenty of interpretations about what the were that were classified as , but because of books and publishing, the notion of became anchored to what is now the modern notion of .

Also, including other kinds of publications, other than born from folk legend, there were also many invented that were created through puns or word plays; the by Toriyama Sekien is one example. When the became popular in the Edo period, it is thought that one reason for the appearance of new was a demand for entertaining ghost stories about no one has ever heard of before, resulting in some that were simply made up for the purpose of telling an entertaining story. The and the are known examples of these.

They are also frequently depicted in ukiyo-e, and there are artists that have drawn famous like Utagawa Kuniyoshi, Yoshitoshi, Kawanabe Ky≈çsai, and Hokusai, and there are also books made by artists of the Kan≈ç school.

In this period, toys and games like and , frequently used as characters. Thus, with the development of a publishing culture, depictions that were treasured in temples and shrines were able to become something more familiar to people, and it is thought that this is the reason that even though were originally things to be feared, they have then become characters that people feel close to.

==== Meiji and Taish≈ç periods ====

* 1891: Publication of the by Shibue Tamotsu. It introduced folktales from Europe, such as the Grimm Tales.
* 1896: Publication of the by Inoue Enry≈ç
* 1900: Performance of the kabuki play at the Kabuki-za in January. It was a performance in which appeared numerous such as the , skeletons, , , among others. Onoe Kikugor≈ç V played the role of many of these, such as the .
* 1914: Publication of the by Mitsutaro Shirai. Shirai expositioned on plant from the point of view of a plant pathologist and herbalist.

With the Meiji Restoration, Western ideas and translated western publications began to make an impact, and western tales were particularly sought after. Things like , , and were talked about, and were even depicted in classical . Although the were misunderstood as a kind of Japanese or , they actually became well known among the populace through a called by San&#x27;y≈´tei Ench≈ç, which were adoptions of European tales such as the Grimm fairy tale &quot;Godfather Death&quot; and the Italian opera (1850). Also, in 1908, Ky≈çka Izumi and jointedly translated Gerhart Hauptmann&#x27;s play &quot;The Sunken Bell&quot;. Later works of Ky≈çka such as were influenced by &quot;The Sunken Bell&quot;, and so it can be seen that folktales that come from the West became adapted into Japanese tales of .

==== Sh≈çwa period ====
Since have been introduced in various kinds of media, they have become well known among people from all walks of life. The from before the war, the manga industry, shops that continued to exist until around the 1970s, and television all contributed to the public knowledge and familiarity with . play a role in attracting tourism revitalizing local mecca regions such as T≈çno in Iwate Prefecture (where stories in Kunio Yanagita&#x27;s &quot;&quot; were collected) or Tottori Prefecture (Shigeru Mizuki&#x27;s birthplace).

In this way, are spoken about in legends in various forms, but traditional oral storytelling by the elders and the older people is rare, and regionally unique situations and background in oral storytelling are not easily conveyed. For example, the classical represented by can only be felt as something realistic by living close to nature, such as with (Japanese raccoon dogs), foxes and weasels. Furthermore, in the suburbs, and other regions, even when living in a primary-sector environment, there are tools that are no longer seen, such as the inkstone, the (a large cooking pot), or the (a bucket used for getting water from a well), and there exist that are reminiscent of old lifestyles such as the and the .

As a result, even for those born in the first decade of the Sh≈çwa period (1925‚Äì1935), except for some who were evacuated to the countryside, they would feel that those things that become are &quot;not familiar&quot; and &quot;not very understandable&quot;. For example, in classical , even though people understand the words and what they refer to, they are not able to imagine it as something that could be realistic. Thus, the modernization of society has had a negative effect on the place of in classical Japanese culture.

On the other hand, the introduced through mass media are not limited to only those that come from classical sources like folklore, and just as in the Edo period, new fictional continue to be invented, such as scary school stories and other urban legends like and , giving birth to new . From 1975 onwards, starting with the popularity of , these urban legends began to be referred to in mass media as &quot;modern &quot;. This terminology was also used in recent publications dealing with urban legends, and the researcher on , , used this especially frequently.

During the 1970s, many books were published that introduced through encyclopedias, illustrated reference books, and dictionaries as a part of children&#x27;s horror books, but along with the that come from classics like folklore, , and essays, it has been pointed out by modern research that there are some mixed in that do not come from classics, but were newly created. Some well-known examples of these are the and the . For example, Arifumi Sato is known to be a creator of modern , and Shigeru Mizuki, a manga artist of , in writings concerning research about , pointed out that newly created do exist, and Mizuki himself, through , created about 30 new .

There has been much criticism that this mixing of classical with newly created is making light of tradition and legends. However, since there have already been those from the Edo period like Sekien Toriyama who created many new , there is also the opinion that it is unreasonable to criticize modern creations without doing the same for classical creations too. Furthermore, there is a favorable view that says that introducing various characters through these books nurtured creativity and emotional development of young readers of the time.
== Comparison with yaoguai ==
Both the Chinese yaoguai and Japanese yokai include strange, supernatural beings with shapeshifting tendencies. In the Chinese version of the yaoguai, the emphasis is often on the first character Â¶ñ yao, which connotes bewilderment and enchantment and supernatural affliction - for example, their ability to take on human form in order to seduce and to enthrall human beings. In the yokai, the emphasis appears to be on the ÊÄ™ guai, or on their monstrous and aberrant nature and anatomy. Japanese yokai in popular culture often includes elements of the cute, comical, the goofy, and the bizarre.

Some creatures appear in both Chinese and Japanese folklore as yaoguai and yokai, such as the scaly water &quot;shuihu&quot; (Ê∞¥Ëôé), wilderness demons denoted as &quot;chimeiwangliang&quot; (È≠ëÈ≠ÖÈ≠çÈ≠â), and nine-tailed fox demons (‰πùÂ∞æÁãê). 

Some, such as the nekomata (cat yokai) and tanuki (raccoon yokai), resemble Chinese yaoguai, which encompasses any number of shapeshifting animals and plants who have learnt to cultivate human form and other supernatural arts. The cat yokai, for example resembles the Chinese ‰ªôÁã∏ or &quot;leopard cat immortal&quot;. 

Yet others are uniquely Japanese, such as the ambivalent and occasionally cute kappa, the haradashi - a goofy yokai with its belly on its face, and the mumashika, which are comical-looking yokai with horse heads and deer bodies.

==In popular culture==
 are often referred to as Japanese spirits or East Asian ghosts, like the legend or the story of the &quot;Slit-mouthed girl&quot;, both of which hail from Japanese legend. The term can also be interpreted as something strange or unusual.

Lafcadio Hearn&#x27;s collection of Japanese ghost stories entitled &quot;&quot; includes stories of y≈´rei and &quot;y≈çkai&quot; such as Yuki-onna, and is one of the first Western publications of its kind.

Y≈çkai remain prevalent in modern works of fiction. Shigeru Mizuki, the manga creator of such series as &quot;GeGeGe no Kitaro&quot; and &quot;Kappa no Sanpei&quot;, keeps &quot;y≈çkai&quot; in the popular imagination. Other popular works focusing on y≈çkai include the &quot;Nurarihyon no Mago&quot; series, Yu Yu Hakusho, Inuyasha: A Feudal Fairy Tale, Yo-kai Watch and the 1960s &quot;Yokai Monsters&quot; film series, which was loosely remade in 2005 as Takashi Miike&#x27;s &quot;The Great Yokai War&quot; and more recently &quot;Yukinobu Tatsu&quot; &#x27;s &quot;Dandadan&quot;. They often play major roles in Japanese fiction.

<text>The common raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides), also called the Chinese or Asian raccoon dog to distinguish it from the Japanese raccoon dog, is a heavy-set, fox-like canid native to East Asia. Named for its raccoon-like face markings, it is most closely related to foxes. Common raccoon dogs feed on many animals and plant matter, and are unusual among canids (dogs, foxes, and other members of the family Canidae) in that they hibernate during cold winters and can climb trees. They are widespread in their native range, and are invasive in Europe where they were introduced for the fur trade. The similar Japanese raccoon dog (&quot;Nyctereutes viverrinus&quot;, the &quot;tanuki&quot;), native to Japan, is the only other living member of the genus &quot;Nyctereutes&quot;.

The closest relatives of the common raccoon dogs are the true foxes, not the raccoon, which is one of the musteloids, and not closely related. Among the Canidae, the common raccoon dog shares the habit of regularly climbing trees only with the North American gray fox, which is neither a true fox nor a close relative of the common raccoon dog.

Due to the fur trade, the common raccoon dog has been widely introduced in Europe, where it has been treated as a potentially hazardous invasive species. In Scandinavia, it is called &quot;marten-dog&quot; (, Norwegian and Danish: ). In Europe, since 2019, the common raccoon dog has been included on the list of Invasive Alien Species of Union concern (the Union list). This implies that this species cannot be imported, bred, transported, commercialized, or intentionally released into the environment in the whole of the European Union.

== Description ==
Common raccoon dog skulls greatly resemble those of South American foxes, particularly crab-eating foxes, though genetic studies reveal they are not closely related. Their skulls are small, but sturdily built and moderately elongated, with narrow zygomatic arches. The projections of the skull are well-developed, with the sagittal crest being particularly prominent in old animals.

Reflecting their omnivorous diets, common raccoon dogs have small and weak canines and carnassials, flat molars, and relatively long intestines ‚Äì (1.5‚Äì2.0¬†times longer than other canids). They have long torsos and short legs. Total lengths can range from . The tail, at long, is short, amounting to less than a third of the animal&#x27;s total length and hangs below the tarsal joints without touching the ground. The ears are short and protrude only slightly from the fur.

Weights fluctuate according to season: in March they weigh , while in August to early September males average , with some individuals attaining a maximal weight of . Specimens from Japanese and Russian studies have been shown to be on average larger than those from Chinese studies.
The winter fur is long and thick with dense underfur and coarse guard hairs measuring in length. The winter fur protects common raccoon dogs from low temperatures ranging down to . It is of a dirty, earth-brown, or brownish-grey colour with black guard hairs. The tail is darker than the torso. A dark stripe is present on the back, which broadens on the shoulders, forming a cross shape. The abdomen is yellowish-brown, while the chest is dark brown or blackish. The muzzle is covered in short hair, which increases in length and quantity behind the eyes. The cheeks are coated with long, whiskery hairs. The summer fur is brighter and reddish straw-coloured.

A rare white colour type occurs in China. They can also come in a yellow colour.

== Ecology ==
=== Diet ===
Common raccoon dogs are omnivores that feed on insects, rodents, amphibians, birds, fish, reptiles, mollusks, crabs, sea urchins, human garbage, carrion, and eggs, as well as fruits, nuts, and berries. Among the rodents targeted by common raccoon dogs, voles seem to predominate in swampy areas, but are replaced with gerbils in flatland areas such as Astrakhan. Frogs are the most commonly taken amphibians; in the Voronezh region, they frequently eat fire-bellied toads, while European spadefoot toads are usually taken in Ukraine. Common raccoon dogs are able to eat toads that have toxic skin secretions by producing copious amounts of saliva to dilute the toxins. They prey on waterfowl, passerines, and migrating birds. Grouse are commonly hunted in their introduced range, and many instances of pheasant predation are recorded in the Ussuri territory.

Common raccoon dogs eat beached fish and fish trapped in small water bodies. They rarely catch fish during the spawning season, but eat many during the spring thaw. In their southern range, they eat young tortoises and their eggs. Insectivorous mammals hunted by common raccoon dogs include shrews, hedgehogs, and, on rare occasions, moles and desmans. In the Ussuri territory, large moles are their primary source of food. Plant food is highly variable, and includes bulbs, rhizomes, oats, millets, maize, nuts, fruits, berries, grapes, melons, watermelons, pumpkins, and tomatoes.

Common raccoon dogs adapt their diets to the season; in late autumn and winter they feed mostly on rodents, carrion, and feces, while fruit, insects, and amphibians predominate in spring. In summer they eat fewer rodents, and mainly target nesting birds, fruits, grains, and vegetables.

=== Predators ===
Wolves are the main predators of common raccoon dogs, killing large numbers of them in spring and summer, though attacks have been reported in autumn, too. In Tatarstan, wolf predation can account for more than half of dog deaths, while in northwestern Russia, it can amount to almost two-thirds. Red foxes kill common raccoon dog pups, and have been known to bite adults to death.

Both foxes and European badgers compete with common raccoon dogs for food, and have been known to kill them if common raccoon dogs enter their burrows. Eurasian lynxes rarely attack them. Birds of prey known to take dogs include golden eagles, white-tailed eagles, goshawks, and eagle owls.

== Behaviour ==
=== Reproduction and development ===

The mating season begins from early February to late April, depending on location. Common raccoon dogs are monogamous animals, with pair formations usually occurring in autumn. Captive males, however, have been known to mate with four or five females. Males will fight briefly, but not fatally, for mates. Copulation occurs during the night, or at dawn, and typically will last 6‚Äì9 minutes. Estrus lasts from a few hours to six days, during which females may mate up to five times. Females enter estrus again after 20‚Äì24¬†days, even when pregnant.

The gestation period lasts 61‚Äì70¬†days, with pups being born in April‚ÄìMay. Litter sizes typically consist of 6‚Äì8¬†pups, though 15‚Äì16¬†pups can be born in exceptional cases. First-time mothers typically give birth to fewer pups than older ones. Males take an active role in raising the pups. This male role is very significant, as demonstrated by early releases in 1928 of pregnant females without males, resulting in very limited success at introduction, while later releases of pairs from 1929 until the 1960s resulted in the common raccoon dog&#x27;s now-extensive introduced European range.

At birth, pups weigh , and are blind and covered in short, dense, soft wool lacking guard hairs. Their eyes open after 9‚Äì10¬†days, with the teeth erupting after 14‚Äì16¬†days. Guard hairs begin to grow after 10¬†days, and first appear on the hips and shoulders. After two weeks, they lighten in colour, with black tones remaining only around the eyes. Lactation lasts for 45‚Äì60¬†days, though pups begin eating food brought to them as early as the age of three weeks to one month. They reach their full size at the age of 4.5¬†months. Pups leave their parents in late August‚ÄìSeptember. By October, the pups, which by then resemble adults, unite in pairs. Sexual maturity is reached at 8‚Äì10¬†months. Their longevity is largely unknown; animals 6‚Äì7¬†years of age have been encountered in the wild, while captive specimens have been known to live for 11 years.

=== Hibernation ===
Common raccoon dogs are the only canids known to hibernate. In early winter, they increase their subcutaneous fat by 18‚Äì23% and their internal fat by 3‚Äì5%. Animals failing to reach these fat levels usually do not survive the winter. During their hibernation, their metabolism decreases by 25%. In areas such as Primorsky Krai and their introduced range, common raccoon dogs hibernate only during severe snowstorms. In December, their physical activity decreases once snow depth reaches , and limit the range from their burrows to no more than . Their daily activities increase during February when the females become receptive, and when food is more available.

=== Vocalizations ===
Common raccoon dogs are usually silent, but males in rut may yelp and growl.

==Subspecies==
, four subspecies are recognised by MSW3:

The Japanese raccoon dog was also considered a subspecies (&quot;N. p. viverrinus&quot;), but is currently thought to represent a distinct species.

== Expanded range and invasive species ==
From 1928 to 1958, 10,000 raccoon dogs of the &quot;N. p. ussuriensis&quot; subspecies were introduced in 76 districts, territories, and republics of the Soviet Union in an attempt to improve their fur quality. Primorye in the Russian Far East was the first region to be colonised, with individuals being transplanted from islands in the Sea of Japan. By 1934, common raccoon dogs were introduced into Altai, the Northern Caucasus, Armenia, Kyrgyzstan (then known as Kirgizia), Tatarstan, Kalinin (now Tver Oblast), Penza, and Orenburg regions. In the following year, they were further introduced into Leningradsky District (Krasnodar Krai), Murmansk, Novosibirsk, and Bashkortostan.

Common raccoon dogs in Irkutsk, Novosibirsk, Trans-Baikaliya, and Altai did not fare well, due to harsh winters and scarce food. Common raccoon dogs also fared badly in the mountainous regions of the Caucasus, Central Asia, and Moldova. However, successful introductions occurred in the Baltic states, European Russia (particularly in then-Kalinin, now Tver Oblast; Novgorod, Pskov, and Smolensk regions), in central Russia (Moscow, Yaroslavl, Vologda, Gorkiy (now Nizhny Novgorod), Vladimir, Ryazan Oblasts, etc.) as well as in the Chernozem belt of Voronezh, Tambov, and Kursk; the lower Volga Region, and the level parts of Northern Caucasus and Dagestan. In Ukraine, the greatest numbers of raccoon dogs were established in Poltava, Kherson, and Lugansk.

In 1948, 35¬†common raccoon dogs were introduced into Latvia. The population increased rapidly. In 1960, Latvia officially reported a total of 4,210¬†common raccoon dogs were hunted.

The common raccoon dog is now abundant throughout Finland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, and has been reported as far away as Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, Belarus, Poland, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, France, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia, and Moldova.

In response, Denmark set a goal of zero breeding for common raccoon dogs by 2015. However, by 2018, it had become fully established in Jutland (the mainland of Denmark, directly connected to Germany), with further projects mainly aimed at limiting or preventing its spread on the Danish islands.

In June 2021, a study commissioned by the United Kingdom&#x27;s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs identified the common raccoon dog as one of 20 invasive species likely to spread to the UK.

== Diseases and parasites ==
=== Coronaviruses ===
A virus similar to SARS-CoV was isolated from Himalayan palm civets (&quot;Paguma larvata&quot;), a common raccoon dog, and humans working in a live-animal market in Guangdong, China in May 2003.

Common raccoon dogs, as well as masked palm civets, were originally believed to be the natural reservoirs of severe acute respiratory syndrome‚Äìrelated coronavirus (SARS). However, genetic analysis has since convinced most experts that bats are the natural hosts. Raccoon dogs were most likely only transient accidental hosts.

According to German virologist Christian Drosten, the common raccoon dog is the most likely intermediate host for transmission of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 to humans, as common raccoon dogs are bred in China in fur farming.

An early locus of COVID-19 transmission was the Huanan live animal market, and even before the pandemic, the place was identified as a likely site for zoonosis (diseases hopping to humans from other species). There were over a thousand common raccoon dogs for sale in the market, and about nine thousand other animals. Samples collected in the market in early 2020 showed high levels of SARS-CoV-2 and common raccoon dog genetic material (often both in the same samples), especially from a stall (&quot;Stall 29&quot;) that kept a cage of raccoon-dogs on top of a cage containing poultry, optimum conditions for the virus to hop the species barrier. The existence of such a stall has been contested by Chinese authorities; the stall had been photographed in 2014 by Edward C. Holmes, an Australian virologist who visited the market while working with local researchers, and while a guest professor with the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) from 2014 to 2020; it had also been filmed by a local in December 2019 and posted on Weibo. Common raccoon dogs are known to be able to catch and spread COVID-19 easily.

These samples were swabs of surfaces in the market; samples from the actual animals in the market would be more conclusive but were not collected. The market was closed on 1 January 2020, and the animals were removed before public-health authorities from the Chinese Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention arrived at the site. Although the samples do not definitively prove that the raccoon dog is the &quot;missing&quot; intermediate animal host in the bat-to-human transmission chain, it does show that common raccoon dogs were present in the Huanan market at the time of the initial SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, in areas that were also positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and substantially strengthens this hypothesis as the proximal origin of the pandemic.

Some Chinese researchers had published a preprint analysis of these samples in February 2022, concluding that the coronavirus in the samples had likely been brought in by humans, not the animals on sale, but omissions in the analysis had raised questions, and the raw sample data had not yet been released. As academic journals often require that the raw data be published prior to review, academics had been expecting the publication of the raw data behind the preprint paper. No raw genetic data had previously been accessible to any academics not working at Chinese institutions until the genetic sequences from some of the market swabs were uploaded to an international database. Florence D√©barre, a researcher at the French National Center for Scientific Research, stumbled across the samples on March 4, 2023, and brought them to the attention of others. An international team of researchers assembled to analyze the new data, but when they reached out to the Chinese researchers from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention who uploaded the data, not only did they not get a reply, but also the samples were removed from the public database by the uploaders. Analysis of the downloaded sequences is proceeding without Chinese collaboration, .

On March 14, 2022, the international group of researchers presented a preliminary analysis at a meeting of the World Health Organization&#x27;s Scientific Advisory Group for Origins of Novel Pathogens, at which several of the Chinese researchers were present. Shortly afterwards, changes in the status of the preprint suggested that it was under review for print publication. The international research team welcomed the move and hoped the Chinese team&#x27;s paper would be revised to include the full genetic data, saying they would also be publishing an analysis and hoped that, as scientists, they would work together on the issues. 

The New York Times was not able to reach the Chinese scientists for comment by March 16, 2022, but George Gao, the former head of the CCDC and lead author on the February 2022 preprint, told &quot;Science&quot; that the raw data had &quot;nothing new&quot;, and he refused to answer questions about why his research team had removed it from the database.

On 17 March 2022, the WHO director-general said that the data should have been shared three years earlier, and called on China to be more transparent in its data-sharing. Further data from further samples has not yet been made public, and Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO&#x27;s COVID-19 technical lead, called for it to be made public immediately.

The Chinese government has long insisted that the virus originated outside China, and until June 2021 denied that live animals were traded at the Huanan market.

=== Other viruses ===
The introduction of the common raccoon dog to Europe is thought to have brought with it infected ticks that introduced the Asian tick-borne meningoencephalitis virus.

Cases of common raccoon dogs carrying rabies are known from the lower Volga, Voronezh, and Lithuania.

Canine distemper occurs in common raccoon dogs inhabiting the northern Caucasus.

=== Bacteria ===
Captive common raccoon dogs in Soviet state animal farms were recorded to carry paratyphoid, anthrax, and tuberculosis.

=== Eukaryotes ===
==== Apicomplexa ====
Massive epizootics of piroplasmosis were recorded in Ukraine and Tartary.

==== Worms ====
Raccoon dogs carry 32 different parasitic worms, including eight trematode species, 17 species of nematodes, seven cestodes, and particularly &quot;Echinococcus&quot;.

==== Arthropods ====
Ticks include &quot;Dermacentor pictus&quot;, &quot;Ixodes ricinus&quot;, &quot;I. persulcatus&quot;, &quot;I. crenulatus&quot;, and &quot;Acarus siro&quot;.

Six species of fleas are known to be carried by them, including &quot;Chaetopsylla trichosa&quot;, &quot;C. globiceps&quot;, &quot;Paraceras melis&quot;, &quot;Ctenocephalides felis&quot;, &quot;C. canis&quot; and &quot;Pulex irritans&quot;.

Although they can be infected with mange, it does not pose a significant threat to their populations as it does with foxes.

== Relationships with humans ==

=== Game and crop damage ===
Common raccoon dogs are harmful to game bird populations, particularly in floodplains and the shorelines of estuaries, where they feed almost exclusively on eggs and chicks during the spring period. Birds amount to 15‚Äì20% of their diets in Lithuania, 46% on the Oka River floodlands, and 48.6% in the Voronezh Reserve. They are also harmful to the muskrat trade, destroying their nests and eating their young. In Ukraine, common raccoon dogs are harmful to kitchen gardens, melon cultivations, vineyards, and corn seedlings.

=== Hunting ===

Common raccoon dogs are typically hunted from November until the snow deepens. In the Far East, they are hunted at night using Laikas and mongrels. In the 19th¬†century, the Goldi and Oroch people fastened bells to the collars of their common raccoon dog hounds. In their introduced range, common raccoon dogs are usually caught incidentally during hunts for other species. Hunting with dogs is the most efficient method in common raccoon dog hunts, having success rates of 80‚Äì90%, as opposed to 8‚Äì10% with guns and 5‚Äì7% with traps. Unless they retreat in their burrows, hunted common raccoon dogs can be quickly strangled by hunting dogs. Traps are usually set at their burrows, along the shores of water bodies, and around marshes and ponds.

In Finland, 60,000‚Äì70,000 common raccoon dogs were hunted in 2000, increasing to 170,000 in 2009 and 164,000 in 2010. Hunting of common raccoon dogs in Hungary began in 1997, with an annual catch of one to nine animals. In Poland, 6,200 were shot in 2002‚Äì2003. Annual Swedish and Danish common raccoon dog hunts usually result in the capture of two to seven individuals. Between 18,000 and 70,000¬†Japanese raccoon dogs were killed in Japan from the post-WWII period to 1982. Japan intensified its common raccoon dog culling starting in the 1970s, averaging 4,529¬†kills annually between 1990 and 1998. The numbers killed have since decreased.

=== Fur use ===

When used on clothing, the fur of the common raccoon dog is often called &quot;murmansky&quot; or &quot;tanuki&quot; fur. In the United States, it is marketed as &quot;Asiatic raccoon&quot;, and in Northern Europe as &quot;Finn raccoon&quot;. Generally, the quality of the pelt is based on the silkiness of the fur, as its physical appeal depends upon the guard hairs being erect, which is only possible in silkier furs. Small common raccoon dog pelts with silky fur command higher prices than large, coarse-furred ones. Due to their long and coarse guard hairs and their woolly fur fibre, which has a tendency to felt or mat, common raccoon dog pelts are used almost exclusively for fur trimmings. Japanese raccoon dog pelts, though smaller than other geographic variants, are the most valued variety, with specimens from Amur and Heilongjiang coming close behind, while Korean and southern Chinese are the least valued. When raised in captivity, common raccoon dogs can produce of wool of slightly lesser quality than that of goats.

Russian trade in common raccoon dogs was quite developed in the Primorye and Ussuri areas in the 1880s. The world trade of common raccoon dog pelts during 1907‚Äì1910 amounted to 260,000‚Äì300,000, of which an estimated 20,000 (5‚Äì8%) came from Russia, though more recent figures estimate a lesser number of 5,000‚Äì6,000; 12,000 common raccoon dogs were caught in the 1930s. In their introduced range, licensed trade of common raccoon dogs began in 1948‚Äì1950, with restrictions being removed in 1953‚Äì1955.After the trade began, the number of catches increased sharply; from 1953‚Äì1961, it fluctuated between 30,000 and 70,000. In the latter year, about 10,000 were taken from their natural range in the Far East, while 56,000 were taken in their introduced range. Of the 56,000, 6,500 came from Belarus, 5,000 in Ukraine, 4,000 each for Latvia, Lithuania, and Krasnodar, 3,700 in Kalinin, 2,700 in Pskov, and 2,300 in Astrakhan, while 1,000‚Äì2,000 pelts each were produced in Vologod, Moscow, Leningrad, Novogrod, Smolensk, Yaroslavl, Azerbaijan, Estonia, and Dagestan. Fewer than 1,000 pelts were produced in all remaining republics and districts. Successful common raccoon dog introductions in Kalinin resulted in animals with denser and softer fur: The length of guard and top hairs increased by 7.96%, that of the underfur increased by 5.3%. The thickness of the guard and top hairs decreased by 3.41%. The density of the fur increased by 11.3%. They also became darker in colour, with black-brown pelts occurring in 8% of specimens, as opposed to 3% in their homeland.

Captive breeding of common raccoon dogs was initiated in 1928 in the Far East, with 15¬†state farms keeping them in 1934. Common raccoon dogs were the principal furbearers farmed during the early years of collective farms, particularly in Ukraine. By the 1940s, this practice lessened in popularity, as the common raccoon dogs required almost the same types of food as silver foxes, which were more valuable. An investigation by three animal protection groups into the Chinese fur trade in 2004 and part of 2005 asserts approximately 1.5¬†million common raccoon dogs are raised for fur in China. The common raccoon dog comprises 11% of all animals hunted in Japan. Twenty percent of domestically produced fur in Russia is from the common raccoon dog.

==== Misrepresentation as artificial fur ====
In several widely publicized incidents, clothing advertised and sold as having synthetic &quot;faux&quot; fur, were documented as actually containing real fur from common raccoon dogs.

On 22¬†December 2006, MSNBC reported Macy&#x27;s had pulled from its shelves and its website two styles of Sean John hooded jackets, originally advertised as featuring &quot;faux&quot; fur, after an investigation concluded garments were actually made from common raccoon dog. 

On 24¬†April 2008, the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) filed a false-advertising complaint with the US Federal Trade Commission alleging at least 20¬†retailers in the U.S. had been mislabeling common raccoon dog fur. They assert 70% of fur garments they tested were common raccoon dog, but were mislabeled as &quot;faux&quot; fur, coyote, rabbit, or other animals. In December¬†2009, Lord &amp; Taylor announced new regulations banning the sale of common raccoon dog fur in its stores.

On 19¬†March 2013, three U.S. retailers settled lawsuits with the U.S. government following an investigation that confirmed they had been selling common raccoon dog fur, but labeling it as fake (‚Äòfaux‚Äô) fur. Neiman Marcus, DrJays.com, and Eminent (Revolve Clothing) reached settlements with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission that do not incur financial penalties unless they mislabel the fur again.

On 19¬†September 2014, the HSUS announced Kohl&#x27;s had been selling common raccoon dog fur as faux fur.

<doc id="238615" wikidata="Q235539" url="?curid=238615" title="Mount Whitney">
<text>Mount Whitney (Paiute: &quot;Too-man-i-goo-yah&quot; or &quot;Too-man-go-yah&quot;) is the highest mountain in the contiguous United States, with an elevation of . It is in East‚ÄìCentral California, in the Sierra Nevada, on the boundary between California&#x27;s Inyo and Tulare counties, and west-northwest of North America&#x27;s lowest topographic point, Badwater Basin in Death Valley National Park, at below sea level. The mountain&#x27;s west slope is in Sequoia National Park and the summit is the southern terminus of the John Muir Trail, which runs from Happy Isles in Yosemite Valley. The eastern slopes are in Inyo National Forest in Inyo County. Mount Whitney is ranked 18th by topographic isolation.

== Geography ==

Mount Whitney&#x27;s summit is on the Sierra Crest and the Great Basin Divide. It lies near many of the Sierra Nevada&#x27;s highest peaks. The peak rises dramatically above the Owens Valley, sitting or just over above the town of Lone Pine to the east, in the Owens Valley. It rises more gradually on the west side, lying only about above the John Muir Trail at Guitar Lake.

The mountain is partially dome-shaped, with its famously jagged ridges extending to the sides. Mount Whitney is above the tree line and has an alpine climate and ecology. Very few plants grow near the summit: one example is the sky pilot, a cushion plant that grows low to the ground. The only animals are transient, such as the butterfly &quot;Parnassius phoebus&quot; and the gray-crowned rosy finch.

=== Hydrology ===
The mountain is the highest point on the Great Basin Divide. Waterways on the peak&#x27;s west side flow into Whitney Creek, which flows into the Kern River. The Kern River terminates at Bakersfield in the Tulare Basin, the southern part of the San Joaquin Valley. Today, the water in the Tulare Basin is largely diverted for agriculture. Historically, during very wet years, water overflowed from the Tulare Basin into the San Joaquin River, which flows to the Pacific Ocean.

From the east, water from Mount Whitney flows to Lone Pine Creek, where most of the water is diverted into the Los Angeles Aqueduct via a sluice. Some water in the creek is allowed to continue on its natural course, joining the Owens River, which terminates at Owens Lake, an endorheic lake of the Great Basin.

=== Elevation measurements ===
The estimated elevation of Mount Whitney&#x27;s summit has changed over the years. The technology of elevation measurement has become more refined and, more importantly, the vertical coordinate system has changed. The peak was commonly said to be at and this is the elevation stamped on the USGS brass benchmark disk on the summit. An older plaque on the summit (sheet metal with black lettering on white enamel) reads &quot;elevation 14,496.811 feet&quot;, but this was estimated using the older vertical datum (NGVD29) from 1929. Since then the shape of the Earth (the geoid) has been estimated more accurately. Using a new vertical datum established in 1988 (NAVD88) the benchmark is now estimated to be .

=== Climate ===

Mount Whitney has an alpine tundra climate (&quot;ET&quot;) under the K√∂ppen climate classification. Summer temperatures are highly variable, ranging from below freezing () to highs near during extreme heat waves in the Owens Valley.

Based on the range from the highest average high of to the lowest average low of for winter temperatures in the table (December to March), every of liquid precipitation equates to approximately of snow, with lower temperatures producing the greater snow depths.

There is no weather station at the summit, but this climate table contains interpolated data for an area below the summit.
== Geology ==

Whitney&#x27;s eastern slope is far steeper than its western slope because the Sierra Nevada is the result of a fault block that is analogous to a cellar door: the door is hinged on the west and is slowly rising on the east.

The rise is caused by a fault system that runs along the Sierra&#x27;s eastern base, below Mount Whitney. Thus, the granite that forms Whitney is the same as that which forms the Alabama Hills, thousands of feet lower down. The raising of Whitney (and the downdrop of the Owens Valley) is due to the same geological forces that cause the Basin and Range Province: the crust of much of the intermontane west is slowly being stretched.

The granite that forms Mount Whitney is part of the Sierra Nevada Batholith. In Cretaceous time, masses of molten rock that originated from subduction rose underneath what is now Whitney and solidified underground to form large expanses of granite. In the last 2 to 10 million years, the Sierra was pushed up, enabling glacial and river erosion to strip the upper layers of rock to reveal the resistant granite that makes up Mount Whitney today.
== Exploration history ==

In July 1864, the members of the California Geological Survey named the peak after Josiah Whitney, the state geologist of California and benefactor of the survey. During the same expedition, geologist Clarence King attempted to climb Whitney from its west side, but stopped just short. In 1871, King returned to climb what he believed to be Whitney, but having taken a different approach, he actually summited nearby Mount Langley. Upon learning of his mistake in 1873, King finally completed his own first ascent of Whitney, but did so a month too late to be first. On August 18, 1873, Charles Begole, A. H. Johnson, and John Lucas, all of nearby Lone Pine, had become the first to reach the contiguous United States&#x27; highest summit. As they climbed the mountain during a fishing trip to nearby Kern Canyon, they called the mountain Fisherman&#x27;s Peak.

In 1881, Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory founder Samuel Pierpont Langley remained on the summit for some time, making daily observations of the solar heat. Accompanying Langley in 1881 was another party consisting of Judge William B. Wallace of Visalia, W. A. Wright and Reverend Frederick Wales. In his memoirs, Wallace wrote, &quot;The Pi Ute [Paiute] Indians called Mount Whitney &quot;Too-man-i-goo-yah&quot;, which means &#x27;the very old man.&#x27; They believe that the Great Spirit who presides over the destiny of their people once had his home in that mountain.&quot; The spelling &quot;Too-man-i-goo-yah&quot; is a transliteration from the indigenous Paiute Mono language. Another variation is &quot;Too-man-go-yah.&quot;
In 1891, the United States Geological Survey&#x27;s Board on Geographic Names decided to recognize the name Mount Whitney. Despite losing out on their preferred name, Lone Pine residents financed the first trail to the summit, engineered by Gustave Marsh, and completed on July 22, 1904. Four days later, the new trail enabled the first recorded death on Whitney. Having hiked the trail, U.S. Bureau of Fisheries employee Byrd Surby was struck and killed by lightning while eating lunch on the summit. In response, Marsh began work on the stone hut that became the Smithsonian Institution Shelter, completing it in 1909.

A movement began after World War¬†II to rename the mountain for Winston Churchill, but the name Mount Whitney persisted.

==Climbing routes==

=== Trails ===

The most popular route to the summit is by way of the Mount Whitney Trail, which starts at Whitney Portal, at an elevation of , west of the town of Lone Pine. The hike is about round trip with an elevation gain of over . Permits are required year-round, and to prevent overuse the Forest Service issues a limited number of permits between May 1 and November 1. It holds an annual lottery for hiking and backpacking permits on the trail. Applications are accepted from February 1 through March 15. Any permits left over after the lottery is completed typically go on sale April 1. Most hikers plan to stay one or two nights camping along the route. Those in good physical condition sometimes attempt to reach the summit and return to Whitney Portal in one day. A one-day hike requires a day-use permit that prohibits the use of overnight camping gear (sleeping bag and tent). Day hikers often leave Whitney Portal before sunrise and hike for 12 to 18 hours.

Longer approaches to Whitney arrive at its west side, connecting to the Mount Whitney Trail near the summit by way of the John Muir Trail.

=== Scrambles ===

The Mountaineer&#x27;s Route, a gully on the north side of the east face first climbed by John Muir, is considered a scramble, (PD+). The fastest recorded time up this route to the summit and back to the portal is 3 hours 10 minutes, by Jason Lakey of Bishop, California.

=== Technical climbs ===
The steep eastern side of the mountain offers a variety of climbing challenges. The East Face route, first climbed in 1931, is one of the &quot;Fifty Classic Climbs of North America&quot; routes, and involves technical free climbing () but is mostly class 4. Other routes range up to grade 5.10d.

South of the main summit is a series of minor summits that are completely inconspicuous from the west but appear as a series of &quot;needles&quot; from the east. The routes on these include some of the finest big-wall climbing in the high Sierra. Two of the needles were named after participants in an 1880 scientific expedition to the mountain: Keeler Needle for James Keeler and Day Needle for William Cathcart Day. The latter has been renamed Crooks Peak after Hulda Crooks, who hiked up Mount Whitney every year until well into her nineties.

<text>Bullhead is the third studio album by the American rock band Melvins, released in 1991 through Boner Records. The album has longer songs than previous Melvins albums. Before this, most of their songs were under two or three minutes.

==Release==
&quot;Bullhead&quot; was originally released in 1991 on vinyl, CD and cassette. Boner Records re-released it on vinyl in 2015, paired with the previous album &quot;Ozma&quot;.

==Reception and legacy==
The Japanese experimental band Boris took their name from &quot;Bullhead&quot;s first track.

The &quot;Richmond Times-Dispatch&quot; wrote that &quot;the spare, chugging intensity of this three-piece Seattle noise unit continues to amaze.&quot;

In 2017, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; listed the album at No. 60 on their list of &quot;100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. They felt that it announced the Melvins as a metal band, citing lengthier songs, a more precise feel and &quot;not so fried&quot; production as reasons. The magazine also felt &quot;Your Blessened&quot;s &quot;optimistic churn&quot; set the way for future metal bands Baroness and Torche.

<doc id="238618" wikidata="Q993757" url="?curid=238618" title="Every Good Boy Deserves Fudge">
<text>Every Good Boy Deserves Fudge is the second studio album by American rock band Mudhoney. It was recorded at a time when the band was thinking of signing to a major record label, but decided to release the album on Sub Pop in 1991. The album shipped 50,000 copies on its original release. It was credited with helping to keep Sub Pop in business.

Guitarist Steve Turner has said that the album is his &quot;favorite Mudhoney album as a whole.&quot;

There is an alternate version of &quot;Check-Out Time&quot; on the &quot;Let It Slide&quot; EP.

==Production==
The album was recorded on low-quality tape via an 8-track desk. It is named after a mnemonic used by music students to recall the notes (EGBDF) on the lines of the treble clef.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote: &quot;Imagine the heaviest of Black Sabbath heavy metal, only somewhat speeded up and with added touches of humor, and you have a good approximation of the Mudhoney way of life.&quot; &quot;Trouser Press&quot; wrote that &quot;Conrad Uno‚Äôs dry 8-track production sharpens Mudhoney‚Äôs garage-rock edge ‚Äî evident in Arm‚Äôs fuzzed-out vocals and a shared fondness for second-hand blues progressions ‚Äî enough to stand apart from the watered-down metal of most flannel merchants, but they don‚Äôt go anywhere with it.&quot; The &quot;Spin Alternative Record Guide&quot; called the album &quot;charming,&quot; writing that a &quot;revitalized sense of hooks connect Mudhoney more directly back to &#x27;60s garage.&quot;

Along with the band&#x27;s debut EP &quot;Superfuzz Bigmuff&quot;, the album was included in &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;, with reviewer Jason Chow calling it &quot;a classic album, one of the best of the genre.&quot;

<doc id="238631" wikidata="Q1228564" url="?curid=238631" title="Crane fly">
<text>A crane fly is any member of the dipteran superfamily Tipuloidea, which contains the living families Cylindrotomidae, Limoniidae, Pediciidae and Tipulidae, as well as several extinct families. &quot;Winter crane flies&quot;, members of the family Trichoceridae, are sufficiently different from the typical crane flies of Tipuloidea to be excluded from the superfamily Tipuloidea, and are placed as their sister group within Tipulomorpha.

The classification of crane flies has been varied in the past, with some or all of these families treated as subfamilies, but the following classification is currently accepted. (Species counts are approximate, and vary over time.)

; Infraorder Tipulomorpha
: Superfamily Tipuloidea (Typical Crane Flies)
:: Family Cylindrotomidae (Cylindrotomid or Long-Bodied Crane Flies, 67 species)
:: Family Limoniidae (Limoniid Crane Flies, 10,786 species, possibly paraphyletic)
:: Family Pediciidae (Hairy-eyed Crane Flies, 498 species)
:: Family Tipulidae (Large Crane Flies, 4,351 species)
: Family Trichoceridae (Winter Crane Flies)

In colloquial speech, crane flies are known as mosquito hawks or &quot;skeeter-eaters&quot;, though they do not actually prey on adult mosquitos or other insects. They are also sometimes called &quot;daddy longlegs&quot;, a name which is also used for arachnids of the family Pholcidae and the order Opiliones. The larvae of crane flies are known commonly as leatherjackets.

Crane flies first appeared during the Middle Triassic, around 245 million years ago, making them one of the oldest known groups of flies, and are found worldwide, though individual species usually have limited ranges. They are most diverse in the tropics but are also common in northern latitudes and high elevations.

More than 15,500 species and over 500 genera of crane flies have been described, the majority by Charles Paul Alexander, who published descriptions of 10,890 new species and subspecies, and 256 new genera and subgenera over a period of 71 years, from 1910 to 1981.

== Description ==
=== Summary ===
An adult crane fly, resembling an oversized male mosquito, typically has a slender body and long, stilt-like legs that are deciduous, easily coming off the body. Like other insects, their wings are marked with wing interference patterns which vary among species, thus are useful for species identification. They occur in moist, temperate environments such as vegetation near lakes and streams. They generally do not feed, but some species consume nectar, pollen and/or water.

The wingspan is generally about , though some species of &quot;Holorusia&quot; can reach . The antennae have up to 19 segments. It is also characterized by a V-shaped suture or groove on the back of the thorax (mesonotum) and by its wing venation. The rostrum is long and in some species as long as the head and thorax together.

Larvae occur in various habitats including marshes, springs, decaying wood, moist soil, leaf litter, fungi, vertebrate nests and vegetation. They usually feed on decaying plant matter and microbes associated with this, but some species instead feed on living plants, fungi or other invertebrates.

=== Formal ===

Tipuloidea are medium to large-sized flies () with elongated legs, wings, and abdomen. Their colour is yellow, brown or grey. Ocelli are absent. The &quot;rostrum&quot; (a snout) is short to very short with a beak-like point called the &quot;nasus&quot; (rarely absent). The apical segment of the maxillary palpi is flagelliform (whip-like) and much longer than the subapical segment. The antennae have 13 segments (exceptionally 14‚Äì19). These are whorled, serrate, or ctenidial (comb-like). There is a distinct V-shaped suture between the mesonotal &quot;prescutum&quot; and &quot;scutum&quot; (near the level of the wing bases). The wings are monochromatic, longitudinally striped or marbled. In females the wings are sometimes rudimentary. The sub-costal vein (Sc) joins through Sc2 with the radial vein, Sc1 is at most a short stump. There are four, rarely (when R2 is reduced) three branches of the radial vein merging into the alar margin. The discoidal wing cell is usually present. The wing has two anal veins. Sternite 9 of the male genitalia has, with few exceptions, two pairs of appendages. Sometimes appendages are also present on sternite 8. The female ovipositor has sclerotized valves and the cerci have a smooth or dentate lower margin. The valves are sometimes modified into thick bristles or short teeth.

The larva is elongated, usually cylindrical. The posterior two-thirds of the head capsule is enclosed or retracted within the prothoracic segment. The larva is metapneustic (with only one pair of spiracles, these on the anal segment of the abdomen), but often with vestigial lateral spiracles (rarely apneustic). The head capsule is sclerotized anteriorly and deeply incised ventrally and often dorsolaterally. The mandibles are opposed and move in the horizontal or oblique plane. The abdominal segments have transverse creeping welts. The terminal segments of the abdomen are glabrous, often partially sclerotized and bearing posterior spiracles. The spiracular disc is usually surrounded by lobe-like projections and anal papillae or lobes.

== Biology ==
Adults have a lifespan of 10 to 15 days. The adult female usually contains mature eggs as she emerges from her pupa, and often mates immediately if a male is available. Males also search for females by walking or flying. Copulation takes a few minutes to hours and may be accomplished in flight. The female immediately oviposits, usually in wet soil or mats of algae. Some lay eggs on the surface of a water body or in dry soils, and some reportedly simply drop them in flight. Most crane fly eggs are black in color. They often have a filament, which may help anchor the egg in wet or aquatic environments.

Crane fly larvae (leatherjackets) have been observed in many habitat types on dry land and in water, including marine, brackish, and fresh water. They are cylindrical in shape, but taper toward the front end, and the head capsule is often retracted into the thorax. The abdomen may be smooth, lined with hairs, or studded with projections or welt-like spots. Projections may occur around the spiracles. Larvae may eat algae, microflora, and living or decomposing plant matter, including wood. Some are predatory.

== Ecology ==

Larval habitats include all kinds of freshwater, semiaquatic environments. Some Tipuloidea, including &quot;Dolichopeza&quot;, are found in moist to wet cushions of mosses or liverworts. &quot;Ctenophora&quot; species are found in decaying wood or sodden logs. &quot;Nephrotoma&quot; and &quot;Tipula&quot; larvae are found in dry soils of pasturelands, lawns, and steppe. Tipuloidea larvae are also found in rich organic earth and mud, in wet spots in woods where the humus is saturated, in leaf litter or mud, decaying plant materials, or fruits in various stages of putrefaction.

Larvae can be important in the soil ecosystem, because they process organic material and increase microbial activity. Larvae and adults are also valuable prey items for many animals, including insects, spiders, fish, amphibians, birds, and mammals.

Adult crane flies may be used for transport by aquatic species of the mite family Ascidae. This is known as phoresis.

== Pest status ==

Some members of the tipulid genus &quot;Tipula&quot;, such as the European crane fly, &quot;Tipula paludosa&quot; and the marsh crane fly &quot;T. oleracea&quot; are agricultural pests in Europe. The larvae of these species live in the top layers of soil where they feed on the roots, root hairs, crown, and sometimes the leaves of crops, stunting their growth or killing the plants. They are pests on a variety of commodities. Since the late 1900s, &quot;T. paludosa&quot; and &quot;T. oleracea&quot; have become invasive in the United States. The larvae have been observed on many crops, including vegetables, fruits, cereals, pasture, lawn grasses, and ornamental plants.

In 1935, Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground in London was among venues affected by leatherjackets. Several thousand were collected by ground staff and burned, because they caused bald patches on the pitch and the pitch took unaccustomed spin for much of the season.

== Phylogenetics ==

The phylogenetic position of the Tipuloidea remains uncertain. The classical viewpoint that they are an early branch of Diptera‚Äîperhaps (with the Trichoceridae) the sister group of all other Diptera‚Äîis giving way to modern views that they are more highly derived. This is thanks to evidence from molecular studies, which is consistent with the more derived larval characters similar to those of &#x27;higher&#x27; Diptera. The Pediciidae and Tipulidae are sister groups (the &quot;limoniids&quot; are a paraphyletic clade). Specifically, Limoniidae has recently been treated by numerous authors at the rank of family, but subsequent phylogenetic analyses revealed that the remaining groups of tipulids render the group paraphyletic. The Cylindrotomidae appear to be a relict group that was much better represented in the Tertiary. Tipulidae probably evolved from ancestors in the Upper Jurassic, the Architipulidae, and representatives of the Limoniidae are known from the Upper Triassic.
== Common names ==
Numerous common names have been applied to the crane fly. Many of the names are more or less regional in the U.S., including mosquito hawk, mosquito eater, gallinipper, and gollywhopper. They are also known as &quot;daddy longlegs&quot; in English-speaking countries outside the U.S., not to be confused with the U.S. usages of &quot;daddy long legs&quot; that refer to either arachnids of the order Opiliones or the family Pholcidae. The larvae of crane flies are known commonly as leatherjackets.

They are also known as &quot;Jenny long legs&quot; in Scotland. In Ireland, they are generally called &#x27;daddy long legs&#x27; in English, whereas in Irish they are commonly known as &quot;Pilib an Gheataire&quot;, which means Skinny Philip.

== Misconceptions ==
There is an enduring urban legend that crane flies are the most venomous insects in the world; however, they have neither venom nor the ability to bite. The myth probably arose due to their being confused with the cellar spider as they are also informally called &quot;daddy longlegs&quot;, and although the arachnid does possess venom, it is not especially potent.

Despite widely held beliefs that adult crane flies (or &quot;mosquito hawks&quot;) prey on mosquito populations, the adult crane fly is anatomically incapable of killing or consuming other insects. Although the adults of some species may feed on nectar, the adults of many species have such short lifespans that they do not eat at all.

<doc id="238632" wikidata="Q1452602" url="?curid=238632" title="Freddie Frinton">
<text>Freddie Frinton (born Frederick Bittiner Coo; 17 January 1909 ‚Äì 16 October 1968) was an English comedian, and music hall and television actor. He is primarily remembered today as a household name in several Central European countries for his 1963 television comedic sketch entitled &quot;Dinner for One&quot;, a perennial national television broadcast New Year&#x27;s Eve favourite there, whilst being largely forgotten in his home country.

==Early life==
Frinton was born in Hainton Avenue, Grimsby, Lincolnshire, the child of a seamstress, Florence Elisabeth Coo (born 1892), and was brought up by foster parents. He started working in a Grimsby fish processing plant, where he is said to have entertained his colleagues with parodies and jokes, but was eventually sacked. He moved into music hall, where he enjoyed modest success and renamed himself Freddie Frinton.

==Career==
During the Second World War he made a moderate breakthrough as a comedian. In 1945, Frinton first performed the sketch &quot;Dinner for One&quot; in Blackpool. As he had to pay a royalty every time he performed the sketch, he bought the rights to &quot;Dinner for One&quot; in the 1950s, which turned out to be a fateful decision.

In 1964, at the age of 55, Frinton became a belated success as the plumber husband in the popular television sitcom &quot;Meet the Wife&quot;, which ran for 40 episodes (the wife was played by Thora Hird). The series is mentioned in the Beatles song &quot;Good Morning Good Morning&quot; with the line &quot;It&#x27;s time for tea and &quot;Meet the Wife&quot;&quot;.

===&quot;Dinner for One&quot;===
In 1963, Frinton&#x27;s &quot;Dinner for One&quot; was recorded by the Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR) German television station. The role of Miss Sophie was played by May Warden. Watching the English language sketch on television has subsequently become a Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, German, Austrian, Finnish, and Swiss New Year&#x27;s Eve tradition, with multiple repeats of the comedy short being shown every year from 1972 onwards.

&quot;Dinner for One&quot; also found fame in Scandinavia where it has been a hugely popular institution on Norwegian, Danish, Finnish, Estonian and Swedish television on New Year&#x27;s Eve for many years, as well as in Belgium in the original version. It has become so popular that several versions in various German dialects have been produced and a version was made for Dutch viewers, with the Dutch actor Joop Doderer playing Frinton&#x27;s role. It is shown every 23 December on Norwegian television (NRK since 1980), and has been shown on the Australian SBS television network on New Year&#x27;s Eve for at least the last fifteen years. It also became a family tradition in South Africa when the SABC aired it every New Year&#x27;s Eve during the 1980s and 1990s. The TV short and its main actor Frinton are far less renowned in Britain than in any of these countries.

Although Frinton originated from Lincolnshire, England, his most famous comedy short had never been shown in full on British television until 2018. It received its first UK screening on 23 November 2018 (more than 50 years after it was made) at the Picture House in Campbeltown, Argyll and Bute, as part of a comedy film festival. The skit was broadcast to a British audience for the first time on Grimsby local TV channel ‚ÄòEstuary TV‚Äô. It was first shown nationwide on 31 December 2018 on the Sky Arts channel.

==Personal life==
Although he was an actor whose roles often comprised playing being inebriated, Frinton was teetotal in real life, having seen in others the damage that alcohol could do.

Frinton was married twice and had five children. His first marriage was to Maisie Basil in 1931; they had one son together. His second wife was Nora Gratton, whom he married in 1945. They had four children: two daughters and two sons.

==Death==
On 16 October 1968, Frinton died unexpectedly from a heart attack in London at the age of 59. His body was buried in the City of Westminster Cemetery, in London.

<text>Tipulidae is a family of large crane flies in the order Diptera. There are more than 30 genera and 4,200 described species in Tipulidae, common and widespread throughout the world.
A crane fly can usually be identified as a member of Tipulidae by its maxillary palps, which is the pair appendages that hang down from the front of its head. If the fourth segment (the farthest from the body) of the maxillary palp is longer than the other three combined, then it is likely to be a member of Tipulidae. Also, there are usually 13 segments in the antennae of large crane flies, compared to 14 or 16 in the common limoniid crane flies.

The oldest fossils that can be assigned confidently to Tipulidae &quot;sensu stricto&quot; are those of the genus &quot;Tipunia,&quot; which date to the Late Jurassic.

<text>George Bruce Bolt (24 May 1893 ‚Äì 27 July 1963) was a pioneering New Zealand aviator.

==Biography==
Bolt was born in Dunedin in 1893. He formed the Canterbury Aero Club in 1910, helping to make and fly gliders on the Cashmere Hills. He used these to take aerial photographs in 1912.

In 1916 Bolt was hired by pioneer pilot Vivian Walsh as a mechanic at the Walsh Brothers Flying School at Kohimarama. He learnt to fly the brothers&#x27; Curtiss flying boats and the machines of their own design, including the Walsh brothers Type D, as well as the two Boeing and Westervelt floatplanes which were the first machines made by that company. 
In 1919 he flew New Zealand&#x27;s first air mail and established an altitude record of . In 1921 he flew from Auckland to Wellington in 5 hours and 16 minutes with stops at Kawhia and Wanganui with Leo Walsh as passenger.

He was a Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) and Royal Air Force (RAF) pilot during World War II, and Chief Engineer of Tasman Empire Airways Limited (TEAL), now known as Air New Zealand, from 1944 to 1960, where his experience with the Short Sandringham led him to play a role in the development of the Short Solent.

Several streets and aviation related facilities in various New Zealand cities are named after him, including George Bolt Memorial Drive, the main access road to Auckland International Airport.

Bolt performed initial research into the achievements of aviation pioneer and inventor Richard Pearse during the late 1950s and early 1960s.

In the 1953 Coronation Honours, Bolt was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services to aviation. His son Richard Bolt also served in the RNZAF and rose to the rank of air marshal.

Bolt died in Auckland in 1963. He was buried at Purewa Cemetery in the Auckland suburb of Meadowbank.

<doc id="238640" wikidata="Q1547664" url="?curid=238640" title="Robin of Sherwood">
<text>Robin of Sherwood is a British television series, based on the legend of Robin Hood. Created by Richard Carpenter, it was produced by HTV in association with Goldcrest, and ran from 28 April 1984 to 28 June 1986 on the ITV network. In the United States it was shown on the premium cable TV channel Showtime and, later, on PBS. It was also syndicated in the early 1990s under the title &quot;Robin Hood&quot;.

The show starred Michael Praed and Jason Connery as two different incarnations of the title character. Unlike previous adaptations of the Robin Hood legend, &quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot; combined a gritty, authentic production design with elements of real-life history, 20th-century fiction, and pagan myth. 

&quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot; has been described by historian Stephen Knight as &quot;the most innovative and influential version of the myth in recent times&quot;. The series is also notable for its musical score by Clannad, which won a BAFTA award. A video game adaptation, &quot;Robin of Sherwood: The Touchstones of Rhiannon&quot;, was released in 1985. The series attained cult status worldwide.

==Production==
===Overview===
Richard Carpenter had previously worked with producer Paul Knight on two other dramas involving historical adventure, &quot;Dick Turpin&quot; (1979‚Äì1982) and &quot;Smuggler&quot; (1981). For their next project, Carpenter and Knight decided to have their production company Gatetarn do an adaptation of the Robin Hood legend. With the aid of television producer Sidney Cole, Carpenter and Knight were able to create a production deal for the show. Goldcrest Films, the US network Showtime, HTV and Gatetarn agreed to fund the series. Carpenter drew on the 1950s TV series &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; and the 1973 film &quot;&quot; as inspirations for &quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot;. Carpenter also used the books &quot;Robin Hood&quot; by the historian J. C. Holt and &quot;The God of the Witches&quot; by the folklorist Margaret Murray as sources for the program. &quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot; was more expensive than Carpenter and Knight&#x27;s previous series; each episode of &quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot; cost around ¬£500,000 to film. Filming on &quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot; began in 1983. The show premiered in 1984, on ITV in the UK and on Showtime in the United States. There were three series, composed of a two-hour opening episode and 24 one-hour long episodes, although the pilot is sometimes screened as two one-hour episodes. The episodes comprising &quot;The Swords of Wayland&quot; were transmitted as one episode in the UK on their original screening, on a bank holiday weekend in 1985. The show was shot on film and almost entirely on location, mostly in the northeast and southwest of England; HTV West in Bristol was the base of operations, and most of the filming was done in and around Bristol and its surrounding counties. Primary locations were the Blaise Castle Estate and Vassells Park. Some of the forest scenes were shot near Bradford-on-Avon.

&quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot; is one of the most influential treatments of the core Robin Hood legend since the classic film &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;. It featured a realistic period setting and introduced the character of a Saracen outlaw. Carpenter also added fantasy elements to the story, which had not appeared in previous TV versions of the legend. These included Robin&#x27;s supernatural mentor Herne the Hunter, Robin&#x27;s magic sword Albion, and appearances by black magicians and demons.

===Michael Praed as Robin===
Michael Praed played Robin of Loxley in the first two series. His &#x27;Merry Men&#x27; consisted of Will Scarlet (Ray Winstone), Little John (Clive Mantle), Friar Tuck (Phil Rose), Much (Peter Llewellyn Williams), the Saracen Nasir (Mark Ryan) and Lady Marian (Judi Trott). He is also assisted by Herne the Hunter (John Abineri). As in the legend, Robin is opposed by the Sheriff of Nottingham (Nickolas Grace) and Guy of Gisburne (Robert Addie), as well as the Sheriff&#x27;s brother Abbot Hugo (Philip Jackson) (representing all the greedy abbots in the legends).

In the opening story, &quot;Robin Hood and the Sorcerer&quot;, Robin and Much fall foul of the Sheriff&#x27;s henchman, Sir Guy of Gisburne and are imprisoned in Nottingham Castle. They manage to escape: as a result of this action, Robin is declared a &quot;wolfshead&quot;, an outlaw, by the authorities. Robin retreats to the woods and gathers a team of fellow rebels to fight back against the Sheriff&#x27;s authority.

===Jason Connery as Robin===
At the end of the second series, Robin of Loxley is killed. Robert of Huntingdon (played by Jason Connery) replaces him as the new Robin Hood. The third series had the same episode count as the first two combined, so each incarnation of Robin featured in the same number of episodes.

At the conclusion of Series Three, Goldcrest was forced to pull out of the venture, due to a downturn in the fortunes of their film arm. Goldcrest had been responsible for critical and commercial hits such as &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; (1981) and &quot;Gandhi&quot; (1982) earlier in the 1980s, but had hit a lean period with such films as &quot;Revolution&quot; (1985) and &quot;Absolute Beginners&quot; (1986). The series was expensive to produce; HTV could not afford to finance it alone, and so &quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot; came to an unexpected end. Goldcrest invested ¬£1,289,000 in the first six episodes, ¬£1,944,000 in the next seven and ¬£4,035,000 in the next twelve. Despite the huge popularity of the series, Goldcrest&#x27;s financial difficulties due to its cinematic investments, prevented further production.

During the course of the third series, the new Robin discovers that he is the half-brother of his nemesis Guy of Gisburne (an idea suggested to Carpenter by the fact that both actors had blond hair). Carpenter had planned to have Guy discover this. This particular story arc was never resolved, as the show&#x27;s intended fourth (and final) series was never made. Series 4 would have also featured the return of Baron de Belleme. The sudden cancellation also broke off Robin and Marion&#x27;s intended marriage and left Marion at Halstead Abbey as a novice. Carpenter later said that, if he had known the third season would be last, he would have married Robin and Marion.

===Attempts at a revival===
After the series ended, Carpenter and Knight tried several times to revive the show. First, Knight attempted to gain funding from US producers for a fourth season, but was unsuccessful. Carpenter then wrote a script for a feature film adaptation of the series, and attempted to gather funding. Carpenter said in a 1990 interview that the film was intended to star the TV series&#x27; regular cast, with a new actor playing Robin if Connery was unavailable. Carpenter also said that the film would not be an adaptation of the unmade fourth season, but &quot;a story on its own&quot;. The appearance of two Robin Hood films in 1991 (&quot;Robin Hood&quot; and &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&quot;) meant that Carpenter and Knight could not interest potential producers in a third Robin Hood film. Coincidently, Jason Connery&#x27;s father Sean Connery cameoed as King Richard in the second film.

==Historical dating==
&quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot; takes place in England in the late 12th and early 13th centuries, during the reigns of the Angevin kings Richard I and John, the usual setting of Robin Hood stories. &quot;Robin Hood and the Sorcerer&quot;, which opens Series One, begins in 1180, then flashes forward fifteen years. In the final episode of Series One, however, King Richard&#x27;s return to England following his capture and ransom is depicted, which in actuality occurred in 1194. The Series Two episode &quot;The Prophecy&quot; is set in the year 1199, when Prince John becomes King of England. In the Series Three episode &quot;The Time of the Wolf&quot;, the Sheriff dictates a legal document dated for the year 1211, and the plot of the episode involves King John raising an army to fight Llywelyn of Wales, an event which, in actual history, took place that same year.

==Cast and characters==
===The Merry Men===
* Robin of Loxley (Michael Praed)Born the son of Anglo-Saxon nobleman Ailric of Loxley, Robin was raised by his uncle, the local miller, after Ailric was murdered. As an adult, Robin accepts the charge of Herne the Hunter and becomes the prophesied &quot;Hooded Man&quot;, champion of the oppressed. Hiding in Sherwood Forest, he assembles a number of friends (who become famous as the &#x27;Merry Men&#x27;) and fights for freedom and justice. He is an exceptional archer and a swordsman and often makes his decisions under the guidance of Herne, who bestows the sword Albion upon him. He falls in love with Lady Marion of Leaford and marries her. He is killed at the end of series two by Norman crossbowmen, on the orders of the Sheriff of Nottingham, the same manner in which his father died.
* Lady Marion of Leaford (Judi Trott)The beautiful and vivacious daughter of Richard of Leaford, a Saxon nobleman, Marion lives as a ward of Abbot Hugo, who is keen on gaining her inheritance. She first enters a nunnery and enjoys her beekeeping, but when Simon de Belleme desires her as his bride (actually intending to sacrifice her), she is rescued by Robin of Loxley and they escape into Sherwood Forest, where they falls in love and marry. She loves Robin unconditionally and is heartbroken upon his death. She&#x27;s later rescued from another unwanted marriage, by Robert of Huntingdon, before falling in love with him towards the end of Season Three.
* Much (Peter Llewellyn Williams)Son of the miller who raised Robin, he admires Robin as his big brother. He is dubbed &quot;the half-wit&quot; by Guy of Gisburne, but he is more uneducated and naive than intellectually impaired. Skilled in his portable Catapult, he often acts as the groups&#x27; messenger and signaller. He loves to play his Flute in his leisure time. He matures more after the first Robin&#x27;s death.
* Will Scarlet (Ray Winstone)Originally called Will Scathlock. When his wife, Elena, is raped, beaten and trampled to death with horses by mercenaries, he changes his name after slaying several of her killers. Hot-headed and filled with hatred of all things Norman, he is contrasted with the more collected Robin, which frequently leads to conflicts. He is a brave fighter and a skillful swordsman and archer. He has a brother who owns an inn in Lichfield.
* Little John of Hathersage (Clive Mantle)Originally John Little from Hathersage, this giant of a man who stands seven feet tall was placed under a spell by the Baron de Belleme. When Robin defeats the Baron and frees John from the spell, John becomes a loyal friend to Robin (and later, to Robert of Huntington). He often fights with his long wooden pole made out of a tree branch but mainly relies on his superhuman strength to dominate over the soldiers of Sheriff. His great stature and strength are contrasted by his soft heart. 
* Friar Tuck (Phil Rose)Chaplain to the Sheriff of Nottingham, he helps Lady Marion escape into Sherwood and joins the merry men, forming a fast friendship with Little John. The fattest member among the merry men, he often uses his sheer bodyweight to his advantage when fighting the soldiers of Sheriff. He prefers not to kill, but to immobilize his enemies. Carpenter said that Tuck &quot;represents the better side of Christianity&quot;.
* Nasir (Mark Ryan)A Saracen assassin, he was captured in Palestine by the Baron de Belleme and brought back to England to work as his henchman. After the Baron is killed by Robin, Nasir, having found respect for Robin during a crucial sword fight decides to join the merry men. Throughout the series, he speaks very little. The only archer who can match Robin, he fights with double swords and is noted for his tracking skills. Initially, he was intended to be killed in episode two, but he proved so popular with the show&#x27;s cast and crew, that Carpenter decided to make him a regular instead.
* Robert of Huntingdon (Jason Connery)Chosen as Robin&#x27;s successor by Herne, Robert frees the merry men, but thinks himself inadequate to take up the mantle of the Hooded Man, despite his sympathies towards the downtrodden. He changes his mind after Lady Marion is taken by Lord Owen of Clun, and sets out to rescue her, valiantly reassembling the scattered merry men in the process. Though slightly insecure about taking over, in light of his predecessor, Robert proves to be an excellent leader. He later discovers that he is the half-brother of Guy of Gisburne.
* Herne the Hunter (John Abineri)A shamanic figure who often incarnates a forest spirit wearing his Sambar deer&#x27;s taxidermy, he represents the powers of light and goodness, and often inspire and protect the Hooded Man from the most perilous situations. Carpenter stated that Herne was based on the Pagan idea of the Horned God.
* Tom (Paul Duggan) ‚Äì One of the initial outlaws who formed the merry men and who was killed in battle at Castle Belleme.
* Dickon (Mark Audley) ‚Äì One of the initial outlaws who formed the merry men and who was killed in battle at Castle Belleme.
* Martin (Martin West) ‚Äì An outlaw who joined the merry men off-screen between the events of &quot;Robin and the Sorcerer&quot; and &quot;The Witch of Elsdon&quot;. He is not seen or heard of after &quot;The King&#x27;s Fool&quot;. It isn&#x27;t known if he left the outlaws or was killed.
* James (Steven Osborne) ‚Äì An outlaw who joined the merry men off-screen after &quot;Robin and the Sorcerer&quot;. He dies in the following episode &quot;Seven Poor Knights from Acre&quot; after trampled to death by the Knights Templar.

===Main antagonists===
* Robert de Rainault, Sheriff of Nottingham (Nickolas Grace)The king&#x27;s chief representative in Nottingham and Sherwood, he is mainly interested in increasing his own power and wealth, competing with his younger brother, the Abbot. He considers his serfs mere chattels and hates women. He frequently relies on the brawn of Guy of Gisburne, whom he nonetheless disrespects and ridicules for his failures. His ambition results in strained relations with fellow noblemen (who consider him a &quot;dreadful little man&quot;), and with a succession of kings.
* Sir Guy of Gisburne (Robert Addie)Steward over the abbot&#x27;s lands and gamekeeper of Sherwood, he is the chief military commander in the area. Self-identifying &quot;a warrior and not a courtier&quot;, he is prone to disregard diplomacy and tact in favour of brute force but he is sometimes also able to use cunning. He resents the Sheriff for frequently taunting him and Robin for being the cause of these taunts. After a rocky start he gained the (limited) respect of Prince John. Later, it is revealed that he is the Earl of Huntingdon&#x27;s illegitimate son and thus the second Robin&#x27;s half-brother.
* Hugo de Rainault, Abbot of St. Mary&#x27;s (Philip Jackson)The sheriff&#x27;s younger brother and highest-ranking church man in Nottingham, his main interest lies in acquiring land, especially that of his temporary ward, Lady Marion, and her father.
* Baron Simon de Belleme (Anthony Valentine)A nobleman and also a devil worshipper. As master of the black arts, he controlled both Little John and Nasir, having captured the latter during the Crusades. He desires Lady Marion to sacrifice her to his demons. He is killed by Robin in Series One but his remaining disciples still work towards and actually succeed in his resurrection in Series Two, although he is not heard of or seen in Series Three.
* Prince John, later King of England (Phil Davis)John is first mentioned in &quot;The King&#x27;s Fool&quot;, where it is stated that the Sheriff and Abbot Hugo supported him against King Richard. King John appears in the episode &quot;The Prophecy&quot;, where he is depicted as manipulative, bullying and lecherous. John becomes King in &quot;The Prophecy&quot; after Richard&#x27;s death. 
* Gulnar (Richard O&#x27;Brien)A pagan sorcerer in the entourage of Lord Owen of Clun, he bewitches Lady Marion. After Owen is killed, he sets out to avenge Owen&#x27;s death and his own disgrace on Robin and the merry men in two different episodes.

===Other notable characters===
* Richard the Lionheart, King of England (John Rhys-Davies)Richard is first encountered by Robin&#x27;s band in Sherwood while returning to Nottingham from the German crusades in disguise. The merry men rescue him from a band of cutthroats and wins his trust. He initially appears to be an ally and says he heard tales about Robin and all the merry men deserved to be hanged many times over. But for saving his life, he pardons them and tries to get Robin to join his army. He subsequently returns to Normandy and is killed by an enemy arrow; the news of his death reaches Nottingham while Prince John is visiting, and Gisburne is the first to declare John the new king.

In repeats, episodes have frequently been broadcast out of order, and alternative orders have been suggested. The original running order creates a number of continuity errors, the most notable being Marian&#x27;s father being referred to as being dead in &quot;The Swords of Wayland&quot; even though he was discovered to be alive in &quot;The Prophecy&quot; and appears in later episodes.

==Music==

The music for &quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot; was composed and performed by Irish folk group Clannad. The show&#x27;s original soundtrack, &quot;Legend&quot;, was released in 1984 and won the BAFTA award for Best Original Television Music.

Three singles were released from the album: the theme-tune &quot;Robin (The Hooded Man)&quot;, &quot;Now is Here&quot; and &quot;Scarlet Inside&quot;. An EP contained a remix of &quot;Robin (The Hooded Man)&quot; from the third series.

While not all of the show&#x27;s music is found on the &quot;Legend&quot; album, some additional pieces can be found on Clannad&#x27;s albums &quot;Macalla&quot; (released in 1986) and &quot;&quot; (released in 2005). In November 2003, Clannad revealed on their official web site that &quot;there were several other pieces of music recorded for the third series of &quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot; that were not included on the &quot;Legend&quot; album&quot;. On 25 October 2024 Clannad released the Legend Extended 40th Anniversary edition includes eleven previously unreleased tracks taken from the classic TV series. It features eleven previously unreleased tracks. This hopefully completes all the missing tracks. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
A review at rpg.net, written in 2003, opines:

Reviewing &quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot; for &quot;SFX&quot; magazine, Jayne Nelson stated that &quot;this incarnation of England&#x27;s most famous outlaw will probably never be bettered&quot;. Nelson praised the show&#x27;s &quot;excellent writing, moody cinematography and haunting score&quot;. Nelson called &quot;The Greatest Enemy&quot; the best episode of the show, followed by &quot;The Swords of Wayland&quot; and &quot;The Sheriff of Nottingham&quot;.

Richard Marcus, writing on blogcritics.org, wrote in 2008:

==Controversy==
ITV aired &quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot; during an early-evening television slot, and promoted the programme as being for a family audience. Mary Whitehouse and the National Viewers and Listeners&#x27; Association criticised &quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot; as being unsuitable for children (as the organisation previously did with &quot;Doctor Who&quot;). Whitehouse claimed that the show depicted &quot;extensive violence&quot;, objected to the depiction of Satanic villains in &quot;The Swords of Wayland&quot;, and also criticised the apparent &quot;resurrection&quot; of Robin in &quot;The Greatest Enemy&quot; as being disrespectful to Christianity. Carpenter later met Whitehouse for a public debate, and introduced himself to her and the audience by saying &quot;I&#x27;m Richard Carpenter, and I&#x27;m a professional writer. And you&#x27;re a professional... what?&quot; &quot;The Guinness Book of Classic British TV&quot; defended &quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot;, stating that the show&#x27;s &quot;swordplay was strictly zero blood&quot; and that the supernatural elements were the result of Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;love for the subject matter&quot;.

==Comic strip==
A comic strip based on &quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot; ran in &quot;Look-in&quot; magazine from April 1984 (issue 18) to September 1986 (issue 39) It was written by Angus Allan, and illustrated mainly by Mike Noble, with some issues illustrated by Arthur Ranson and Phil Gascoine; colours were by Arthur Ranson. The first 6 stories (32 issues) were in full colour, and the remainder were in black and white, with the exception of the 19th story which marked the change of character from Michael Praed&#x27;s Robin to Jason Connery&#x27;s.

In 2022, Rebellion, Chinbeard Books and Spiteful Puppet jointly published &quot;Robin of Sherwood: The Complete Look-In Comics&quot;, which collected all of the strips. This was a limited-edition run.

==Audio plays==
By July 2015, Bafflegab Productions, the producers of the audio play/comic book series &quot;The Scarifyers&quot;, and co-producer Barnaby Eaton-Jones were adapting a feature-length script entitled &quot;Robin of Sherwood: The Knights Of The Apocalypse&quot;, written by Richard Carpenter before his death in 2012. Jason Connery, Judi Trott, Ray Winstone, Clive Mantle, Mark Ryan, Phil Rose, Philip Jackson, and Nickolas Grace (Robert of Huntingdon, Lady Marion, Will Scarlet, Little John, Nasir, Friar Tuck, Abbot Hugo, and the Sheriff of Nottingham, respectively) all agreed to reprise their roles for the project, with Daniel Abineri taking the role of Herne in place of his father, John Abineri, who died in 2000. That December, Barnaby Eaton-Jones took over as sole producer of the audio play, with Spiteful Puppet (the award-winning audio company who produced &#x27;Hood&#x27;) as executive producers, as approved by ITV Studios and Richard &#x27;Kip&#x27; Carpenter&#x27;s estate. After beginning its crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo in September, the production set a goal of ¬£10,000 within 30 days to cover production costs; due to enthusiastic fan support, however, the goal was reached in just under 24 hours. The audio play was released in 2016, with proceeds going to the Sherwood Forest Trust and the British Red Cross.

The success of the play led to Spiteful Puppet announcing a set of four further &#x27;Robin of Sherwood&#x27; plays for 2017, two featuring Jason Connery and two featuring Michael Praed. This release was later pushed back to 2018 but a series of enhanced audiobooks was announced, with the first four being released in December 2017.

In May 2024 AUK Studios (which had purchased Spiteful Puppet), Chinbeard Books and Oak Tree Books released a new project, &quot;Robin of Sherwood: Tales Untold&quot;, to celebrate the show&#x27;s fortieth anniversary. This was an audio CD contained five audio dramas about characters from &quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot;, with an accompanying novel. &quot;Robin of Sherwood: Tales Untold&quot; cast included Oliver Tobias, Robert Daws, Terry Molloy, Daniel Peacock and Claire Parker.

<doc id="238644" wikidata="Q1226593" url="?curid=238644" title="Dinner for One">
<text>Dinner for One, also known as The 90th Birthday (), is a television comedy sketch that is repeated every New Year&#x27;s Eve in several European countries. The two-hander sketch was originally written by British author Lauri Wylie for the theatre. After featuring on the stage, the German TV broadcaster, Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR), recorded the sketch in 1963 as an 18-minute black-and-white videotape recording, performed in English by British comedians Freddie Frinton and May Warden. The sketch begins with an introduction in German, followed by the main act in English, and is available online.

It has become traditional viewing on New Year&#x27;s Eve in countries such as Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Estonia. In Norway it is broadcast on 23 December. As of 1995 it was the most frequently repeated television programme in Germany. Despite originating as a British stage sketch, the TV version gained only limited recognition in the UK over 50 years after its recording. It was broadcast on New Year&#x27;s Eve in Britain on Sky Arts from 2018 to 2020.

In other parts of the world, the sketch is broadcast in Australia and South Africa. Apart from a few satires, &quot;Dinner for One&quot; is not known in the United States, where the comic premise had already been made famous by Red Skelton and Lucille Ball.

In 2003, Danish TV producer Paul Anthony S√∏rensen directed and produced a documentary about the sketch that includes interviews with relatives of Freddie Frinton and May Warden. It was nominated for the Rose d&#x27;Or 2004.

==Plot==
In German-speaking countries, the broadcast features an introduction by Heinz Piper as the conferencier: Miss Sophie (Warden) is celebrating her 90th birthday. As every year, she has invited her four closest friends to a birthday dinner: Sir Toby, Admiral von Schneider, Mr. Pomeroy, and Mr. Winterbottom. However, she has outlived all of them, requiring her butler James (Frinton) to impersonate the guests. In some non-German-speaking countries the introduction is omitted.

James must not only serve Miss Sophie the four courses &quot;√† la russe&quot; ‚Äì mulligatawny soup, North Sea haddock, chicken and fruit ‚Äì but also serve the four imaginary guests the drinks chosen by Miss Sophie (sherry, white wine, champagne and port wine for the respective courses), slip into the role of each guest and drink a toast to Miss Sophie four times for each course. As a result, James becomes increasingly intoxicated and loses his dignified demeanour: he pours the drinks with reckless abandon, breaks into &quot;Sugartime&quot; by the McGuire Sisters for a brief moment, and at one point accidentally drinks from a flower vase, which he acknowledges with a grimace and exclaims &quot;Oooh! I&#x27;ll kill that cat!&quot;

There are several running gags in the piece:
*James frequently trips over the head of a tigerskin rug; as an additional embellishment, he walks past it in one instance to his own astonishment, but then stumbles over it on the way back. In another instance, he gracefully steps over it, and in the final instance, the tipsy James leaps over the head.
*Sir Toby would like to have poured a small extra amount of each drink, and James complies with the request with initial politeness and then increasing sarcasm.
*Miss Sophie expects James, as Admiral von Schneider, to knock his heels together with the exclamation &quot;Sk√•l!&quot; (Scandinavian for &quot;Cheers!&quot;). Because this action proves painful, he asks each time whether he really has to, but obliges upon Miss Sophie&#x27;s insistence. On one occasion James&#x27; feet miss each other, causing him to stumble.
*Before each course, James asks (this gradually becomes a babble): &quot;The same procedure as last year, Miss Sophie?&quot;; Miss Sophie replies &quot;The same procedure as every year, James.&quot;

Finally, Miss Sophie concludes the evening with an inviting &quot;I think I&#x27;ll retire&quot;, to which James and Sophie repeat their exchange concerning the &quot;same procedure&quot;. James takes a deep breath, turns to the audience with a sly grin and says &quot;Well, I&#x27;ll do my very best&quot; before the pair retreat to the upper rooms.
Both phrases &quot;The same procedure as last year?&quot; and &quot;The same procedure as every year&quot; are known to practically every German speaker that has some knowledge of English and have become part of the German language.

==Origin of the sketch==
Lauri Wylie debuted &quot;Dinner for One&quot; as a sketch in his London stage revue &quot;En Ville Ce Soir&quot; in 1934.

Frinton and Warden performed &quot;Dinner for One&quot; on stage on Britain&#x27;s seaside piers as early as 1945; Frinton inherited the rights to the sketch in 1951 after Wylie&#x27;s death. The sketch was also staged elsewhere, for example in 1953 in &quot;John Murray Anderson&#x27;s Almanac&quot; at the Imperial Theatre with Hermione Gingold playing Miss Sophie, and Billy DeWolfe as the butler and four dead friends.

In 1962, German entertainer Peter Frankenfeld and director Heinz Dunkhase discovered &quot;Dinner for One&quot; in Blackpool. The sketch was staged in Frankenfeld&#x27;s live show on 8 March 1963 at the &quot;Theater am Besenbinderhof&quot;, Hamburg. Since no recordings of live TV shows could be made with the technology of the time, a recorded version was commissioned, which was staged at NDR&#x27;s Studio B in the Lokstedt quarter of Hamburg, in front of a live audience, between 30 April and 4 May 1963. This version was first broadcast on 8 July 1963. The sketch was recorded in English with a short introduction in German. The introductory theme, Charmaine, was composed by Lew Pollack and recorded by the Victor Silvester orchestra. According to the NDR, Frinton and Warden were each paid DM 4,150. The recorded show was re-run occasionally until it gained its fixed spot on New Year&#x27;s Eve in 1972.

The comic premise of the skit‚Äîa man consuming multiple rounds of alcohol and becoming comically drunk‚Äîis generally credited to American actor Red Skelton, who included a similar sketch as part of his vaudeville routines beginning in 1928 (and allowed the premise to be used by Lucille Ball in the famed &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; episode &quot;Lucy Does a TV Commercial&quot;). There is no definitive evidence of when Wylie wrote the sketch; the first evidence there is of the &quot;Dinner for One&quot; sketch being performed is from 1934, and as neither Skelton nor Wylie were internationally famous at the time, neither one likely knew of the other&#x27;s work.

==Broadcasting countries==
The sketch has become a viewing tradition on New Year&#x27;s Eve in German-speaking countries, where up to half the population may watch it every year on New Year&#x27;s Eve. Some die-hard fans even copy the meal served in the sketch. The full 18-minute version is typically aired in Germany on Das Erste in the afternoon, and the regional third channels several times throughout the afternoon and evening. In Austria, ORF 1 airs the full sketch around 11:30¬†pm. Swiss public broadcaster SRF shows its own 11-minute version around 7:00¬†pm on SRF 1 and at 11:50¬†pm on SRF zwei.

In Finland, the show is viewed by 400,000 viewers each New Year&#x27;s Eve. It is also a New Year tradition in Scandinavian countries.

In Sweden, the show was suspended for six years after its first screening, deemed unsuitable because of James&#x27;s heavy drinking. However, the TV network finally capitulated to popular demand and brought it back. It has been broadcast every year since 1976 in Sweden, with the exception of 2004 in the wake of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami.

In 1985, the Danish television network, DR, decided not to broadcast the sketch, but received so many complaints that it returned the following year. With this single exception, &quot;Dinner for One&quot; has been shown on DR every 31 December since 1980.

It is also broadcast annually on New Year&#x27;s Eve in the Faroe Islands.

In Norway, the show is broadcast on 23 December, also since 1980. In 1992, it was aired 15 minutes early, and the resulting audience uproar caused it to be re-broadcast later that night.

It is broadcast annually on New Year&#x27;s Eve in Australia by public broadcaster SBS (since 1989) and South Africa, though it is not as well known as in Europe. It was shown briefly in the US (by HBO) in the 1970s.

The sketch is almost completely unknown in the United Kingdom, and its first national British television airing did not come until Sky Arts broadcast the film on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2018 (although a year before, the film had been screened on Grimsby local channel Estuary TV). The Sky Arts broadcast included English subtitles for the German-language introduction, the end of which briefly faded out followed by a fade in on Frinton, cutting out the moment when the German announcer introduces James.

In German-speaking countries, the sketch is usually shown in the original English without dubbing or subtitles. It is easy to understand with even a basic knowledge of English due to the physical nature of the comedy. British people are often perplexed by German fans&#x27; ability to quote dialogue.
After its sensational success on continental Europe Norddeutscher Rundfunk offered the sketch to the BBC. However, BBC was not interested since the sketch did not meet BBC quality standards.

==Different versions==

The NDR television channel recorded several other versions in 1963. Danish TV shows a version in which no audience is heard.

A third, 11-minute version was recorded by Schweizer Fernsehen (Swiss Television) with less alcohol drunk.

Both the 18-minute and 11-minute versions have been released on DVD in Germany.

In 1977, the Dutch public broadcasting system created a Dutch language version starring Joop Doderer, but this never achieved the same popularity.

In 1999, the NDR released a colourised version.

In Denmark, a parody of the sketch was filmed, subtitled &quot;The 80th Birthday&quot;, in which Miss Sophie&#x27;s friends are still at the table (though the NDR version mentions that the last of Miss Sophie&#x27;s friends died 25 years ago). Other versions have been produced in different German dialects, including one in Low German (this version, &quot;Dinner for One Up Platt,&quot; is also aired on NDR in rotation annually along with the original), various re-enactments or parodies by different comedians, and a version featuring the German glove puppet character Bernd das Brot (&quot;Bernd the Bread&quot;) named &quot;dinner for brot&quot;.
In 1992 a color version was filmed in the Frankfurt festival hall with Bodo Maria and Macha Stein. The resulting VHS cassette/DVD was dedicated to the Frankfurt UFA GmbH star Camilla Horn. Camilla Horn had originally been meant to play the role of Miss Sophie. However, she had to withdraw due to illness.

On 24 December 2011, a digitally edited satirical version entitled &quot;The 90th Euro rescue summit, or, Euros for No One&quot;, produced by Udo Eling and German state broadcaster ARD, was uploaded to YouTube. It features German Chancellor Angela Merkel as Miss Sophie and French President Nicolas Sarkozy as her servant and has new German (and some French) dialogue about the Eurozone debt crisis.

In 2016, Netflix made a parody in which the guests are replaced with characters from Netflix shows, specifically Saul Goodman from &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; and &quot;Better Call Saul&quot;, Frank Underwood from &quot;House of Cards&quot;, Pablo Escobar from &quot;Narcos&quot;, and Crazy Eyes from &quot;Orange is the New Black&quot;.

==Catch phrase: &quot;Same procedure as every year&quot;==
The line &quot;Same procedure as every year&quot; (in the original English) has become a very popular catchphrase in Germany. The phrase has entered everyday vocabulary, and is used in newspaper headlines and advertisements. This is also the case in Norway, Denmark and Sweden.

==Legacy==
The sketch resonated strongly with Norwegian, Luxembourgish and German audiences. The sketch is one of the most widely known pieces of English-language media in Europe despite its relatively minimal impact in Britain.

Deutsche Post issued a commemorative stamp for the show on 11 October 2018.

In January 2021, Google added an easter egg to their Knowledge Panel for the film. The panel included a tiger&#x27;s head, which when clicked showed James running across the screen and tripping over said tiger. It also featured sound clips from the film, chiefly the line &quot;Same procedure as every year, James.&quot;

In December 2022, it was announced that German studio UFA would produce a six-part prequel series, set 50 years before the original version.

In March 2023, King Charles III, delivering a speech at a banquet during his state visit to Germany, raised a laugh by saying, in German, &quot;It is nice of you all, not to have left me alone with a &#x27;Dinner for One&#x27;!&quot; In his speech to the German Bundestag, Charles III referred to &quot;Miss Sophie&quot; as an example of cultural exchange between Britain and Germany; although he admitted that Miss Sophie does not &quot;give a very accurate impression of modern Britain&quot;.

<doc id="238646" wikidata="Q204903" url="?curid=238646" title="Protostar">
<text>A protostar is a very young star that is still gathering mass from its parent molecular cloud. It is the earliest phase in the process of stellar evolution. For a low-mass star (i.e. that of the Sun or lower), it lasts about 500,000 years. The phase begins when a molecular cloud fragment first collapses under the force of self-gravity and an opaque, pressure-supported core forms inside the collapsing fragment. It ends when the infalling gas is depleted, leaving a pre-main-sequence star, which contracts to later become a main-sequence star at the onset of hydrogen fusion producing helium.

==History==
The modern picture of protostars, summarized above, was first suggested by Chushiro Hayashi in 1966. In the first models, the size of protostars was greatly overestimated. Subsequent numerical calculations clarified the issue, and showed that protostars are only modestly larger than main-sequence stars of the same mass. This basic theoretical result has been confirmed by observations, which find that the largest pre-main-sequence stars are also of modest size.

==Protostellar evolution==
Star formation begins in relatively small molecular clouds called dense cores. Each dense core is initially in balance between self-gravity, which tends to compress the object, and both gas pressure and magnetic pressure, which tend to inflate it. As the dense core accrues mass from its larger, surrounding cloud, self-gravity begins to overwhelm pressure, and collapse begins. Theoretical modeling of an idealized spherical cloud initially supported only by gas pressure indicates that the collapse process spreads from the inside toward the outside. Spectroscopic observations of dense cores that do not yet contain stars indicate that contraction indeed occurs. So far, however, the predicted outward spread of the collapse region has not been observed.

The gas that collapses toward the center of the dense core first builds up a low-mass protostar, and then a protoplanetary disk orbiting the object. As the collapse continues, an increasing amount of gas impacts the disk rather than the star, a consequence of angular momentum conservation. Exactly how material in the disk spirals inward onto the protostar is not yet understood, despite a great deal of theoretical effort. This problem is illustrative of the larger issue of accretion disk theory, which plays a role in much of astrophysics.

Regardless of the details, the outer surface of a protostar consists at least partially of shocked gas that has fallen from the inner edge of the disk. The surface is thus very different from the relatively quiescent photosphere of a pre-main sequence or main-sequence star. Within its deep interior, the protostar has lower temperature than an ordinary star. At its center, hydrogen-1 is not yet fusing with itself. Theory predicts, however, that the hydrogen isotope deuterium (hydrogen-2) fuses with hydrogen-1, creating helium-3. The heat from this fusion reaction tends to inflate the protostar, and thereby helps determine the size of the youngest observed pre-main-sequence stars.

The energy generated from ordinary stars comes from the nuclear fusion occurring at their centers. Protostars also generate energy, but it comes from the radiation liberated at the shocks on its surface and on the surface of its surrounding disk. The radiation thus created must traverse the interstellar dust in the surrounding dense core. The dust absorbs all impinging photons and reradiates them at longer wavelengths. Consequently, a protostar is not detectable at optical wavelengths, and cannot be placed in the Hertzsprung‚ÄìRussell diagram, unlike the more evolved pre-main-sequence stars.

The actual radiation emanating from a protostar is predicted to be in the infrared and millimeter regimes. Point-like sources of such long-wavelength radiation are commonly seen in regions that are obscured by molecular clouds. It is commonly believed that those conventionally labeled as Class 0 or Class I sources are protostars. However, there is still no definitive evidence for this identification.

<text>Foodtown was a New Zealand supermarket chain owned by Progressive Enterprises (now Woolworths New Zealand). As with Woolworths, the Foodtown brand was phased out in the late 2000s, with all stores rebranded as Countdown by the end of 2011. Foodtown supermarkets were typically integrated with a shopping centre; the chain had few stand-alone stores.

==History==

=== 1958‚Äì1961 Foodtown Supermarkets Limited ===
On 18 June 1958, the first Foodtown supermarket of 1,400 square metres was opened on a 1.1-hectare site at ≈åtƒÅhuhu. Three small business owners ‚Äì Tom Ah Chee, Norman Kent, and John Brown ‚Äì sold their small businesses and pooled their resources to personally build and supervise construction of New Zealand&#x27;s first American-style supermarket. The ≈åtƒÅhuhu supermarket proved a success and a second Foodtown was built and opened in Takanini, South Auckland in 1961.

=== 1961‚Äì1988 Progressive Enterprises ===
In 1961 the company was restructured when the Picot family joined the business. Their family company, Progressive Enterprises, contributed an equal amount of capital to that accumulated by the three original partners and became the parent company to Foodtown Supermarkets Limited.

=== 1988‚Äì1992 Coles Myer Limited ===
In March 1988 Progressive Enterprises became part of the Australian company Coles Myer. During this time it saw the expansion of the Foodtown chain to areas outside Auckland (Hamilton, Wellington, Tauranga, Palmerston North, Wanganui and New Plymouth) and also saw greater expansion within the wider Auckland area.

=== 1992‚Äì1994 Progressive Enterprises ‚Äì public company ===
In April 1992 Coles Myer relaunched Progressive Enterprises onto the New Zealand stock exchange as a public company. During this time no new Foodtown supermarkets were opened.

=== 1993‚Äì2005 Progressive Enterprises ‚Äì Foodland Associated Limited ===
In October 1993 Foodland Associated Limited (FAL) bought the majority shareholding from Coles Myer and shortly after bought all remaining public shares and delisted Progressive from the New Zealand stock exchange. With this purchase Progressive Enterprises became the parent company for a number of FAL brands. Progressive Enterprises consisted of: Foodtown Supermarkets, Countdown, 3 Guys, Georgie Pie Restaurant, Rattrays and SuperValue.

On 17 June 2002 Progressive Enterprises Ltd bought Woolworths (NZ) Ltd from Hong Kong‚Äìbased owners Dairy Farm Group. The sale saw Progressive&#x27;s supermarket brands Foodtown, Countdown, 3 Guys, SuperValue and FreshChoice joined by Woolworths, Big Fresh and Price Chopper. As a result, PEL increased its share of the NZ grocery market to approximately 45%.

Foodtown was the first supermarket in New Zealand to launch a loyalty card called the &quot;Foodtown Card&quot;, which offered exclusive discounts and competitions to cardholders. This was renamed in 2003 after the merger of Progressive and Woolworths (NZ) Ltd as the &quot;Foodtown Woolworths onecard&quot;.

In 2004, there were 28 Foodtown stores.

=== 2005‚Äì2011 Progressive Enterprises ‚Äì Woolworths Limited ===

On 24 November 2005 Australian company Woolworths Limited purchased Progressive Enterprises Limited from Foodland Associated Limited.

In October 2006, Progressive Enterprises announced a discount fuel scheme with Gull Petroleum and Shell to offer discounts on petrol when shoppers spent $40 or more in their Woolworths, Foodtown or Countdown Stores. This scheme was similar to the one their parent company Woolworths Limited offered in Australia.

In 2008, there were 33 Foodtown stores including 29 in Auckland.

In 2008, Progressive Enterprises announced their intention to phase out the Foodtown brand. Existing Foodtown locations were to be rebranded as Countdown over a 5-year period, as each store was to receive periodic upgrades. No existing Foodtown stores were to be closed as a result of this ‚Äì although the store in Cameron Road, Tauranga, which was situated almost directly opposite a Countdown store, closed on 1 May 2011 due to &quot;dwindling profits&quot;. In some areas, the location of a Foodtown near a Countdown resulted in two Countdowns close to each other, sometimes 100m. For example, a Countdown exists in the Manukau City Mall located at Westfield Manukau as well as in the stand-alone Manukau branch located on Great South Road. Another notable mention is the Countdowns in Highland Park, where there are Countdowns within 100m of each other. Another example is at Westfield Glenfield which has two Countdowns almost directly opposite each other, one of them being a converted Foodtown.

On 14 November 2011, the last Foodtown, at Browns Bay, was rebranded to Countdown, bringing an end to the iconic New Zealand brand.

<text>Arch Enemy is a Swedish melodic death metal band, originally a supergroup from Halmstad, formed in 1995. Its members were in bands such as Carcass, Armageddon, Carnage, Mercyful Fate, Spiritual Beggars, The Agonist, Nevermore, and Eucharist. It was founded by Carcass guitarist Michael Amott along with Johan Liiva, who were both originally from the death metal band Carnage. The band has released eleven studio albums, three live albums, three video albums and four EPs. The band was originally fronted by Johan Liiva, who was replaced by German vocalist Angela Gossow in 2000. Gossow left the band in March 2014, subsequently becoming the group&#x27;s manager, and was replaced by Canadian vocalist Alissa White-Gluz.

==History==

===Early years and &quot;Black Earth&quot; (1995‚Äì1997)===
Arch Enemy was formed in 1995 by Michael Amott, and the debut album &quot;Black Earth&quot; was recorded during nine days in Studio Fredman and released by the now defunct Wrong Again Records in 1996.

===&quot;Stigmata&quot;, &quot;Burning Bridges&quot;, and Gossow (1998‚Äì2000)===

After the release of &quot;Black Earth&quot; the band switched labels, signing a contract with Century Media. In 1998 Arch Enemy released &quot;Stigmata&quot;, for which bassist Martin Bengtsson and drummer Peter Wildoer joined the band. The album gained a wider audience and popularity in Europe and America. This was also the first Arch Enemy album to be released worldwide.

In 1999, Sharlee D&#x27;Angelo (ex-King Diamond, ex-Mercyful Fate) assumed the role of Arch Enemy&#x27;s bassist, and Daniel Erlandsson (Eucharist, ex-Carcass) was again recruited as the drummer. &quot;Burning Bridges&quot; was released, and was followed by the live album &quot;Burning Japan Live 1999&quot;. During the touring-cycle for &quot;Burning Bridges&quot;, D&#x27;Angelo was temporarily replaced twice; first by Dick L√∂vgren (Meshuggah, ex-Armageddon) and then by Roger Nilsson (ex-Spiritual Beggars, Firebird, the Quill).

In November 2000, vocalist Johan Liiva left and was replaced by German death metal vocalist Angela Gossow.

===&quot;Wages of Sin&quot; and &quot;Anthems of Rebellion&quot; (2001‚Äì2004)===
The first album with songs featuring Gossow was &quot;Wages of Sin&quot;, released in 2001. In December of the same year, Arch Enemy took part in the &quot;Japan&#x27;s Beast Feast 2002&quot; concert, playing alongside Slayer and Mot√∂rhead.

&quot;Anthems of Rebellion&quot; was released in 2003 and brought some innovations, such as the use of a second voice singing in harmony; such as in the &quot;End of the Line&quot; and &quot;Dehumanization&quot; tracks. In November of the following year, the band released the EP &quot;Dead Eyes See No Future&quot;, which featured live recordings, along with covers of Manowar, Megadeth and Carcass songs. In June 2004, the band embarked upon yet another Japan tour.

===&quot;Doomsday Machine&quot; (2004‚Äì2006)===
In June 2005, Arch Enemy finished the recording for their sixth album, &quot;Doomsday Machine&quot;. In July 2005, guitarist Christopher Amott left the band in order to focus on his personal life. He was temporarily replaced by guitarist Gus G. (ex-Ozzy Osbourne, Firewind) and then by Fredrik √Ökesson (Opeth, ex-Talisman) in September 2005. Christopher returned on a permanent basis in March 2007, shortly before the band entered the studio to begin recording their new album with producer Fredrik Nordstr√∂m (who had previously worked with the band on their first four albums). √Ökesson went on to become Opeth&#x27;s new lead guitarist in May 2007.

===&quot;Rise of the Tyrant&quot; (2007‚Äì2008)===

Arch Enemy&#x27;s seventh album, entitled &quot;Rise of the Tyrant&quot; was released on 24 September 2007 in Europe and 25 September 2007 in the United States. &quot;Rise of the Tyrant&quot; debuted at number 84 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. This surpassed the &quot;Doomsday Machine&quot; chart entry, making it the band&#x27;s highest charting effort to date. Gossow said the new album has more emotion and less double vocals, as well as less vocal processing, yielding a more &quot;raw&quot; presentation.

Arch Enemy played the Bloodstock Open Air Festival in August 2007, between Sabbat and In Flames. They then performed on the Black Crusade tour at the end of 2007 with Machine Head, Trivium, DragonForce and Shadows Fall.

On 8 March 2008 Arch Enemy filmed a live show in Tokyo, Japan for the live DVD &quot;Tyrants of the Rising Sun&quot;. Arch Enemy also co-headlined the &quot;Defenders of the Faith&quot; tour in April 2008 with Opeth, while DevilDriver and 3 Inches of Blood opened for them. They then headlined the &quot;Tyranny and Bloodshred&quot; tour in May 2008 with Dark Tranquillity, Divine Heresy, and Firewind as supporting acts.

===&quot;The Root of All Evil&quot; (2009‚Äì2010)===
A compilation album titled &quot;The Root of All Evil&quot; was released on 28 September 2009 in Europe, 30 September in Japan, and 6 October in the United States. &quot;The Root of All Evil&quot; features twelve re-recorded songs spanning the band&#x27;s career before Gossow joined as vocalist, with some material pre-dating D&#x27;Angelo as their bassist. In the first half of 2009, the band toured Europe and South America, and then played at the annual &quot;Dubai Desert Rock Festival&quot; alongside Opeth, Chimaira, and Mot√∂rhead. Following the release of &quot;The Root of All Evil&quot; on 28 September 2009, the band embarked on an Asian and Australian tour, which included their first visit to New Zealand. The tour started at the &quot;Loud Park festival&quot; in Japan on 17 October supplementing other acts including Megadeth, Judas Priest, Slayer, Anthrax, Rob Zombie and Children of Bodom. They also toured in South Korea on 25 October headlining at the Melon AX Hall in Seoul.

===&quot;Khaos Legions&quot; and Christopher&#x27;s second departure (2011‚Äì2013)===

According to a September 2010 interview with Angela Gossow, Arch Enemy entered the studio on 1 December to begin recording their eighth album, &quot;Khaos Legions&quot;, for a release in June 2011, according to the band&#x27;s website. The first single from the album was released on the Century Media website on 31 March entitled &quot;Yesterday is Dead and Gone&quot;. The album was released on 31 May 2011. On 12 December the band announced that they would be filming a show in Cologne the following day for an upcoming live DVD entitled &quot;World Khaos Tour&quot;.

On 3 March 2012 it was announced on the band&#x27;s Facebook page that Christopher Amott had once again departed from the band. He was replaced by Nick Cordle from Arsis. Arch Enemy released their third music video from Khaos Legions on 25 April 2012 for &quot;Under Black Flags We March&quot;. Not only does Nick Cordle appear in the video, he also recorded a new guitar solo, making this his debut track with the band.

===Gossow&#x27;s departure and &quot;War Eternal&quot; (2013‚Äì2015)===
On 3 March 2014 the band revealed their ninth album would be titled &quot;War Eternal&quot;, released in June 2014.

On 17 March 2014, Gossow released a statement announcing her departure from the group and welcoming her replacement, former vocalist of Canadian metalcore band the Agonist, Alissa White-Gluz. In the statement, she wrote that while she had enjoyed her time with the group, it was time for her to move on, be with her family and pursue other interests. Gossow did confirm that she would remain Arch Enemy&#x27;s business manager and would be &quot;passing the torch to the super talented Alissa White-Gluz, whom I&#x27;ve known as a dear friend and a superb vocalist for many years. I always thought she deserved a chance to shine ‚Äì and now she&#x27;s getting it. Just like I got that chance back in 2001.&quot;

White-Gluz also released a statement saying: &quot;I am very honored and happy to announce a new chapter in my life and musical career. &quot;Wages of Sin&quot; was the first metal album I ever bought, and it was love at first listen. It is not often that you get a phone call from your favorite band asking you to join! I am thrilled to have the opportunity to work with such amazingly talented musicians whom I also consider great friends. I look forward to being able to write and perform at a whole new level now with Arch Enemy! Music is forever, metal is limitless and this is only the beginning!&quot;

During Arch Enemy&#x27;s North American tour in support of their album &quot;War Eternal&quot;, guitarist Nick Cordle left the band on 10 November 2014. Specifically, he left the stage with only a few songs remaining in the set during the show at San Francisco&#x27;s Regency Ballroom. Christopher Amott temporarily re-joined the band for the remainder of the tour, while famed guitarist Jeff Loomis (formerly of Nevermore) was announced as the official replacement and joined the band for their European tour with Kreator and subsequent events.

=== New project Black Earth (2016‚Äì2017) ===
On 22 January 2016, the founding members of Arch Enemy formed a side project named Black Earth. Consisting of former members Liiva and Christopher Amott, and current members Daniel Erlandsson, Michael Amott, and Sharlee D&#x27;Angelo, the band played a sold out Japan tour in May 2016 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of both Arch Enemy and the release of their debut album, &quot;Black Earth&quot;, they only performed songs from the band&#x27;s first three albums.

=== &quot;Will to Power&quot; (2016‚Äì2019) ===
On 26 August 2016, it was announced that Arch Enemy was working on their tenth studio album which would be released in 2017. On 22 May 2017, the band revealed that the album would be entitled &quot;Will to Power&quot;, to be released on 8 September 2017 by Century Media Records.

On 21 October 2021, Arch Enemy premiered the music video for their new single &quot;Deceiver, Deceiver&quot;. On 9 December 2021, they released a music video for another single, &quot;House of Mirrors&quot;. On 27 January 2022, Arch Enemy announced their eleventh album, entitled &quot;Deceivers&quot;, released on 12 August 2022 (originally announced for 29 July 2022, but later postponed). Along with the album announcement came the third single &quot;Handshake with Hell&quot;, with yet another music video. The song was listed as Loudwire&#x27;s &quot;best metal/rock song&quot; of 2022, after &quot;We&#x27;ll Be Back&quot; by Megadeth. On 22 April 2022, the band announced the fourth single from the new album, &quot;Sunset over the Empire&quot;, released on 20 May 2022, digitally and as a limited 7&quot; vinyl with a B-side &quot;The Judging Eyes&quot;, an instrumental remake of &quot;You Will Know My Name&quot; from 2014‚Äôs &quot;War Eternal&quot;.

Concepcion&#x27;s first tour with the band was the Deceivers Asia Tour which took place in April and May 2024, and was the final tour of the &quot;Deceivers&quot; album cycle.

==Musical style==
Arch Enemy&#x27;s musical style has been classified as melodic death metal. AllMusic critic Steve Huey describes the band&#x27;s sound as a &quot;blend [of] progressive and death metal influences.&quot; Earlier albums, such as &quot;Burning Bridges&quot;, while still classified as melodic death metal, are more centered around classic death metal. Invisible Oranges described the band&#x27;s sound as &quot;sort of a watered-down version&quot; of Carcass&#x27;s 1993 album &quot;Heartwork&quot;.

<text>The Mentors are an American heavy metal band, known for their deliberate shock rock lyrics. Originally formed in Seattle, Washington in May 1976, they relocated to Los Angeles, California in 1979.

The band garnered attention both from noted hard rock acts and pro-censorship movements such as the Parents Music Resource Center, but the death of drummer and lead singer Eldon Hoke (&quot;El Duce&quot;) in 1997 brought them unprecedented attention.

== History ==
Founding members Eldon Hoke (&quot;El Duce&quot;), Eric Carlson (&quot;Sickie Wifebeater&quot;) and Steve Broy (&quot;Dr. Heathen Scum&quot;) attended Roosevelt High School together in Seattle, and began experimenting together with crude punk and primitive heavy metal. Upon formation, the Mentors began to tour the Northwest, playing shows with their trademark executioner hoods (it was the idea of El Duce, who adored a horror movie called &quot;Mark of the Devil&quot;) and bawdy lyrics. In the early days of the band, El Duce would contact venues saying they were a Kiss cover band and send them a dubbed cassette with Kiss songs on it and say it was them. On one occasion he sent a copy of Deep Purple Live in Japan to what they thought was a club. It was later revealed to be a pizza place and they ended up playing a kid&#x27;s birthday party. They were forced to stop after one song and were eventually given $50. Broy was in and out of the band during its early career due to his preoccupation with pursuing a degree in engineering. Other bassists from this era include Jeff Dahl, Chris Jacobsen (Jack Shit), and Mike Dewey (Heathen Scum Wezda).

Through Mystic Records, the Mentors released their first EP, &quot;The Trash Bag&quot;, in 1983. Their first live album, &quot;Live at the Whiskey/Cathey de Grande&quot;, came out the following year; both records were produced by Phillip (Philco) Raves. In 1985, they signed to Death Records, a subsidiary of Metal Blade, and released their debut studio LP, &quot;You Axed for It!&quot;, with Broy returning on the bass. During this time, Hoke maintained a strong public presence, making a controversial appearance alongside fellow metal band GWAR on &quot;The Jerry Springer Show&quot;, where Hoke&#x27;s band, beliefs and public image were criticized.

The Mentors did not achieve true notoriety until the 1985 Congressional hearings orchestrated by Tipper Gore&#x27;s Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC). The relatively obscure Mentors caught the attention of the PMRC with their song &quot;Golden Shower&quot;, prompting a reading of some of its lyrics on the Congressional floor.

Broy was briefly replaced by bassists Wayne Daddio (&quot;Ripper&quot;), Ed Danky (&quot;Poppa Sneaky Spermshooter&quot;), Lucinda Rezabek (&quot;Scum Bitch&quot;) and
Keith McAdam (&quot;Zippy&quot;), but later returned to the group. In 1989, the Mentors released their third album, &quot;Sex, Drugs &amp; Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, a faux-live record. This album caught the attention of the band Revolting Cocks, who invited the Mentors on tour with them.

They released &quot;Rock Bible&quot; in 1990, with Rick Lomas (&quot;Insect On Acid&quot;) sitting in on drums. &quot;To the Max&quot; followed the next year. Clark Savage (&quot;Moosedick&quot;) often filled in for Hoke on drums at live shows, as Hoke&#x27;s alcoholism had made it difficult for him to play drums and sing simultaneously, eventually taking the position as drummer while Hoke became vocalist exclusively.

The Mentors remained sporadically active thereafter. Hoke began a solo career, while Carlson formed the band Jesters of Destiny. In 1997, while being interviewed for the documentary film &quot;Kurt and Courtney&quot;, Hoke claimed that Courtney Love had offered him $50,000 to kill her husband Kurt Cobain, whose death was ruled a suicide. Two days after being interviewed, Hoke died after being struck by a freight train while intoxicated. His death was alternately described as an accident and a suicide; however, some conspiracy theorists have claimed there is evidence suggesting foul play.

Carlson, Broy and Savage continued the band and were joined by guitarist Jeff Solberg (&quot;Sickie J&quot;) and vocalist Jake Huber (&quot;El Rapo&quot;), releasing &quot;Over the Top&quot; in 2005. In 2006, singer and drummer Marc DeLeon (&quot;Mad Dog&quot;), of the Mentors tribute band the Mantors, replaced Huber and, later, Savage. &quot;Ducefixion&quot;, their eighth full-length record, was released in 2009. DeLeon left the Mentors in 2014 during the making of a full-length documentary film called &quot;The Mentors: Kings of Sleaze Rockumentary&quot;, directed by April Jones.

On May 25, 2017, the Mentors released &quot;The Illuminaughty&quot;, their first studio album in eight years, with Broy and Lomas sharing the vocal duties.

In 2019, a documentary about the band and Hoke, &quot;The El Duce Tapes&quot;, was released to the festival circuit, featuring unreleased interviews with Hoke from 1990-91 and discussing the Mentors in the context of modern-day cancel culture. The film was released on Blu-ray, streaming, and limited-edition VHS in 2020.

Carlson died from cancer on December 29, 2024 at the age of 66, leaving Broy as the only surviving member of the classic &quot;You Axed for It!&quot; lineup.

<text>In American English, walkway is a composite or umbrella term for all engineered surfaces or structures which support the use of trails.

&quot;The New Oxford American Dictionary&quot; also defines a walkway as &quot;a passage or path for walking along, esp. a raised passageway connecting different sections of a building or a wide path in a park or garden.&quot; The word is used to describe a footpath in New Zealand, where &quot;walkways vary enormously in nature, from short urban strolls, to moderate coastal locations, to challenging tramps [hikes] in the high country [mountains]&quot;. Similarly in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, Canada, the &quot;Grand Concourse&quot; is an integrated walkway system that has over of walkways, which link every major park, river, pond, and green space in six municipalities.

In Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the SkyWalk is an approximately enclosed and elevated walkway (skyway) connecting Union Station to the CN Tower and the Rogers Centre (SkyDome). It is part of the PATH network. The SkyWalk passes above the York Street &#x27;subway&#x27; and the Simcoe Street Tunnel. It opened in 1989 and it was built to reduce the need for additional parking spaces near the Skydome stadium by providing a direct transportation link to the subway and GO trains. PATH is a network of pedestrian tunnels beneath the office towers of Downtown Toronto, and the largest underground shopping complex in the world.

In British English, a walkway more specifically refers to a covered or raised passage in a building, typically connecting separate buildings.

<text>Conflict is an English anarcho-punk band originally based in Eltham in South London. 

Formed in 1981, the band&#x27;s original line up consisted of: Colin Jerwood (vocals), Francisco &#x27;Paco&#x27; Carreno (drums), John (bass guitar), Steve (guitars), Pauline (vocals), Paul a.k.a. &#x27;Nihilistic Nobody&#x27; (visuals). Their first release was the 1982 EP &quot;The House That Man Built&quot; on Crass Records. By the time they released their first album, 1983s &quot;It&#x27;s Time to See Who&#x27;s Who&quot;, on Corpus Christi Records, Pauline and Paul had left the band. 

In 1983 Conflict set up their own Mortarhate Records label, which put out their own records as well as releases by other artists including Hagar the Womb, Icons of Filth, Lost Cherrees, The Apostles, and Stalag 17. A sub-label Fightback Records, was active from 1984-1986.

In 1983, Steve Ignorant, who was at the time a member of the band Crass, guested on the band&#x27;s pro-animal rights single &quot;To A Nation of Animal Lovers&quot;. After the dissolution of Crass, Ignorant later became second vocalist for Conflict on a semi-permanent basis until the mid 1990s. 

The band&#x27;s &quot;Mighty and Superior&quot; was voted #53 best song of the year by the John Peel Festive Fifty radio show audience in 1985, a year that show played the top 70.

Conflict has always been outspoken regarding issues such as anarchism, animal rights, the anti-war movement and in their support for the organisation Class War. A number of their gigs during the 1980s were followed by riots and disturbances. On Saturday 18th April 1987 Conflict appeared at the Brixton Academy in London as part of a benefit event titled &quot;The Gathering of the 5000&quot; which intended to raise money for causes including the Animal Liberation Front, London Greenpeace, Hunt Saboteurs Association, Class War, Housmans Bookshop and Anti-Fascist Action. According to the band, fans leaving the event were attacked by the police, which led to a riot culminating in 52 arrests and several police officers being injured.

In a 2016 primer on anarcho punk for The Wire (magazine), the band were described as: 

Former band drummer, Francisco &quot;Paco&quot; Carreno, died on 20 February 2015, at the age of 49.
In August 2019 long-term bassist, Hoddy, decided to step down from bass duties after over 30 years. Later that year Fran Fearon was recruited on bass and additional vocalist, Fi. 

The current line-up of Colin, Gav, Stu, Fran and Fi have been touring since 2021 and are currently rehearsing and recording new material. A new live album &quot;Live in Dublin&quot; was released in 2024 and the first new studio material for over 20 years, a 7&quot; single entitled &quot;THIS IS CONFLICT&quot;, was released November 2024. A full studio album is expected to be released in early 2025.

<doc id="238672" wikidata="Q550048" url="?curid=238672" title="Sona (constructed language)">
<text>Sona is an international auxiliary language created by Kenneth Searight and described in a book he published in 1935. The word in the language itself means &quot;auxiliary neutral thing&quot;. The similarity to the English word &#x27;sonorous&#x27; is superficial.

Searight created Sona as a response to the Eurocentricity of other artificial auxiliary languages of his time, such as Esperanto and Ido. At the same time, Searight intended his language to be more practical than most &quot;a priori&quot; languages like Solresol or Ro, which were intended to be unbiased by any particular group of natural languages. Thus, &quot;Sona&quot; sacrificed familiarity of grammar and lexicon for some measure of &quot;universality&quot;, while at the same time preserving basic notions common to grammars around the world such as compounding as a method of word formation. Searight used inspiration from many diverse languages, including English, Arabic, Turkish, Chinese and Japanese, to create his eclectic yet regular and logical language.

Searight specifically chose only sounds that speakers of many languages could say, therefore making it a true universal language. He hoped that in a perfect world, Sona would be taught to young children everywhere.

Sona is an agglutinative language with a strong tendency towards being an isolating language. The language has 360 &quot;radicals&quot; or root words whose meanings are based on the categories in Roget&#x27;s original thesaurus, plus an additional 15 particles. Ideas and sentences are formed by juxtaposing the radicals. Thus, &quot;ra&quot; &quot;male&quot; plus &quot;ko&quot; &quot;child&quot; makes &quot;rako&quot; &quot;boy&quot;.

Searight&#x27;s book, &quot;Sona; an auxiliary neutral language&quot; (London, K. Paul, Trench, Trubner &amp; Co., Ltd., 1935, LCCN: 35016722) is the only published example of this language. There is a small community on the Internet interested in reviving and using Sona.

== Writing ==
Sona uses the Latin alphabet and contains 24 letters. Although the author provides the rules for writing in Sona in his text, he also specifies that Sona has &quot;few hard and fast rules.&quot; One mentioned rule in regards to writing covered by Searight is that foreign words are written with a capital. Even in regards to punctuation, Searight claims it is &quot;desirable that we leave the matter more or less opened to choice.&quot;

== Alphabet ==
The Sona alphabet has 24 letters. Searight lists no official order but presents the following chart:

The vowels are sounded as in Italian. British English equivalents are &quot;fast, fete, machine, fort, rule&quot;. &quot;y&quot; is the neutral vowel of Welsh, but before another vowel, it is pronounced as the English &quot;y&quot; (e.g. &quot;yard&quot;). The alphabet letters are &quot;named&quot; by adding the vowel &quot;y&quot;. For the vowels of the alphabet, the y is initial, such as &quot;ya, ye, yi, yo, yu, y&quot;, and is final for aspirates and consonants, such as &quot;cy, gy, ky,&quot; etc. The &quot;y&quot; is also useful for separating two like vowels in a word and for separating an -n radical from a vowel. For instance, &quot;ta-ata&quot; becomes &quot;tayata&quot; and &quot;ta-o&quot; becomes &quot;tayo&quot;. This helps reduce confusion by distinguishing words from other similar combined radicals. &quot;i&quot; and &quot;u&quot; are shortened before a vowel. The only consonant that is final allowed is &quot;-n.&quot;

== Radicals ==
The language consists of 360 radicals and 15 particles, each of which represents a single unit of meaning. Every word in Sona can be decomposed into radicals and, conversely, new words can be constructed by combining them in various ways. Radicals are meant to represent symbolic ideas or groups of ideas, and this simplifies the language by connecting words to one another based on universal concepts.

The radicals are organized into groups of five which share both a consonant-vowel root and a fundamental meaning. Each radical in the group is created by attaching a-, u-, or i- or -n. For example, the group &quot;ta&quot; (increase) also contains the radicals &quot;tan&quot; (bulk), &quot;ata&quot; (extension), &quot;ita&quot; (filling), and &quot;uta&quot; (swelling).

When radicals are combined, their order affects the resulting meaning. A radical used as a prefix will be dominant, while one used as a suffix will be subordinate, hence &quot;tara&quot; &quot;big man&quot; versus &quot;rata&quot; &quot;giant.&quot;

A radical can change meaning depending on its context. Some radicals take on a different meaning when used as an affix, e.g. when used as a prefix, the meaning of &quot;ka&quot; changes from &quot;lead&quot; to a causal maker. Many compounds take on set meanings beyond that of their component parts. For example, &quot;akizu&quot;, literally &quot;fast animal,&quot; signifies &quot;horse.&quot;

== Phonetics and phonology ==
The 360 radicals are split up into consonants and aspirates. Of the 12 consonants, each can be categorized five different ways, isolated and with the four possible affixes. This gives us 300 radicals. The 6 aspirates, &quot;c, j, x, f, v,&quot; and &quot;h&quot;, have only the &quot;-n&quot; form, which gives us the remaining 60 radicals. Searight decided to exclude diphthongs from Sona in order to maintain its universality. Here is an example of how radicals are modified with prefixes and suffixes to create new words.
There are 180 disyllables, and the remaining 5 monosyllables are the particles &quot;au, ua, ue, ui,&quot; and &quot;uo&quot;. The only vowels allowed as radical prefixes are &quot;a, i,&quot; and &quot;u.&quot;

Sona does not use a formal suffix for possession, but one may add &quot;-si&quot; for emphasis, which is the equivalent of an English &quot;-&#x27;s&quot;.

The epithet is always placed before its head word, so one would say &quot;the big dog,&quot; as in English, and not &quot;the dog big,&quot; as in Spanish.

While radicals may be compounded, they also can be isolated words. For instance, &quot;te&quot; alone means &quot;hand,&quot; but compounding it creates &quot;tebi&quot; (handle), &quot;bute&quot; (nose), and &quot;tega&quot; (arm).

As for the aspirates, &quot;h&quot; is aspirated, &quot;x&quot; is pronounced like the &quot;sh&quot; in &quot;shin,&quot; &quot;j&quot; may be sounded as in the English &quot; §&quot; or the French &quot; í&quot;. Since there is already a letter &quot;k&quot; in Sona, &quot;c&quot; is pronounced like the &quot;ch&quot; in &quot;chin.&quot; &quot;f&quot; and &quot;v&quot; are pronounced how English speakers pronounce them.

As for the consonants, only three of them need mentioning. &quot;g&quot; is always a hard G, meaning it is pronounced like the G in Gary as opposed to the G in Gym. &quot;z&quot; is pronounced like the Z in &quot;zeal,&quot; but it can vary to the Italian variation of &quot;dz&quot;, or the German variation of &quot;ts&quot;. Also, &quot;s&quot; is always sharp, meaning it never sounds like a Z as in &quot;as.&quot; The remaining consonants are pronounced as English speakers would pronounce them. Sona also has no double consonants or digraphs.

Sona utilizes elision, meaning when a radical with a vowel prefix is followed by its own primary or &quot;-n&quot; form, the common vowel is dropped. For example, &quot;ata-ta&quot; becomes &quot;atta&quot;, and &quot;ata-tan&quot; becomes &quot;attan&quot;.

For foreign sounds and words, Sona uses the phonetic symbol for that word and writes it with an initial capital letter. Sona rarely utilizes capital letters, and &quot;Sona&quot; is the only word in Sona spelled with a capital letter. For technical and scientific terms, such as Greek and Latin words, Sona leaves them as is, occasionally changing an initial C to K to match the sounds, for instance &quot;Carnival&quot; becomes &quot;Karnival&quot;. These words are spelled in accordance with the language of origin, and last names are not altered.

Sona is not a tonal language and therefore the tonic accent is evenly distributed throughout speech, such as Japanese and French.

Punctuation is not a necessary part of the language since there are prefixes and suffixes for questions and emphasis. However, in Sona it is up to a person&#x27;s preference whether or not they would like to use punctuation.

For nouns, the definite article is &quot;en&quot;, meaning &quot;it,&quot; and is optionally used for emphasis. For instance, &quot;ra&quot; stands for &quot;man&quot;, but &quot;en ra&quot; means &quot;the (very) man.&quot; There is no indefinite article in Sona. It does, however, borrow an Honorific from Japanese. O is used before names, words of address, and verbs as an expression of politeness. For instance, &quot;O ra&quot; means &quot;honorable man.&quot; It can also mean &quot;please.&quot;

For naming, the radical &quot;ha&quot;, meaning &quot;name,&quot; converts another radical into a name that addresses a person. For instance, &quot;hara&quot; (name and man) signifies Mr. Monsieur, Signor, Herr, Sir, etc. Inanimate objects have no gender. Sex is marked by &quot;ra&quot;, meaning male or man, and &quot;zan&quot;, meaning female or woman.

== Morphology ==
All words can be fully analyzed into their constituent radicals (with the exception of proper nouns and borrowed words). As a result, the morphology of the language is a combination of isolating and agglutinating, and contains no fusional element.

Most word formation is done by compounding. When compounding radicals, the first one is said to be the &quot;governing radical,&quot; and the following ones act as modifiers. The language also permits the compounding of polysyllabic words.

=== Inflectional morphology ===

==== Nouns ====
There are twelve cases. For nominative and accusative, the noun and the verb are compounded. For the former, the noun comes first and for the latter, the verb. For possessive, the possessor is simply placed before the possessed, but the suffix &quot;-si&quot; can be added to the possessor if needed for clarification. Three of the cases are formed with affixes: the vocative with &quot;-ha&quot;, the directive with &quot;-li&quot;, and the locative with &quot;a-.&quot; The remaining cases are formed analytically with a word placed before the noun: &quot;dili&quot; for the motive, &quot;li&quot; for the dative, &quot;ne&quot; for the ablative, &quot;bi&quot; for instrumental, &quot;vi&quot; for genitive, and &quot;di&quot; for partitive.

Nouns can optionally be marked for plural (&quot;-e&quot;), collective (-&quot;gi&quot;).

Only animate nouns are marked for gender: &quot;ra&quot; for male, &quot;zan&quot; for female, and &quot;-ji&quot; or &quot;-ci&quot; for neuter, with the latter having an additional agentive meaning. The inanimates have special noun affixes which mark them as either inorganic (&quot;-na&quot;) or organic (&quot;-ga&quot;).

The augmentative is &quot;-ta-&quot; and the diminutive is &quot;-ko-&quot;. The approbative is marked by &quot;-xa&quot; and the disapprobative is marked by &quot;-ze&quot;.

===== Adjectives =====
The comparative is formed by &quot;e-&quot; and superlative is formed by &quot;en e-&quot; (with &quot;en&quot; meaning &quot;the&quot;). However, they do not have to be marked explicitly. Compare &quot;koyo ra&quot; &quot;small man&quot;, &quot;ekoyo ra&quot; &quot;smaller man&quot;, and &quot;en ekoyo ra&quot; &quot;the smallest man.&quot;
==== Verbs ====
Both prepositions and pronouns may be optionally attached to the end of the verb.

Three different radicals can be used to mark transitivity: -ka- (&quot;cause&quot;), -ba (&quot;strike, forceful&quot;), -ru (&quot;go, get&quot;).

Searight gives this verb paradigm using the root &quot;ru&quot;, &quot;move,&quot; as an example:
=== Derivational morphology ===

==== Nouns ====
Instrumental nouns can be formed with &quot;-bi&quot;; places are denoted by &quot;-a, -ma,&quot; or &quot;-ca&quot;; buildings by &quot;-kan&quot;; times are formed with &quot;-ri.&quot;

Abstract nouns may be formed in several ways. A noun of state is produced with &quot;-ne&quot;, a verbal noun is produced with -&quot;da&quot;, and a noun of quality is produced with &quot;-vi&quot;. For example, starting with the radical &quot;di&quot;, &quot;divide,&quot; one can create &quot;dine,&quot; &quot;division;&quot; &quot;dida&quot;, &quot;dividing;&quot; and &quot;divi&quot;, &quot;particularity.&quot;

==== Adjectives ====
The primary method of adjective formation is the suffix &quot;-(y)o&quot;, as in &quot;tayo&quot;, &quot;great.&quot; They can be used as predicates by omitting the o, as in &quot;ra ta&quot;, &quot;the man is big.&quot;

Adjectives with more specific meanings can be derived in several other ways. Searight gives the following list, using &quot;ra&quot;, &quot;man,&quot; to generate an example of each:
==== Adverbs ====
Some adverbial forms are derived by a suffix, like adjectives, while others are formed analytically. The default method of creating an adverb is the word &quot;po&quot; preceding it. Searight offers the following adverb derivations:
==== Verbs ====
Radicals can be converted into verbs analytically by the addition of &quot;da&quot; before the root.

== Syntax ==
Searight&#x27;s central claim on syntax in Sona is that &quot;the construction of the Sona sentence is based upon the logical sequence of ideas.&quot; The syntactical structure of Sona is intended to be as intuitive and logical as possible, although Searight does present some rules in his text under the &quot;Syntax&quot; section. According to Searight, the word order is SVO, with qualifying words preceding the words they qualify. Searight stresses that &quot;the construction of the Sona sentence must not be confined to European models.&quot;

<doc id="238674" wikidata="Q193934" url="?curid=238674" title="Paperback">
<text>A paperback (softcover, softback) book is one with a thick paper or paperboard cover, and often held together with glue rather than stitches or staples. In contrast, hardback (hardcover) books are bound with cardboard covered with cloth, leather, paper, or plastic.

Inexpensive books bound in paper have existed since at least the 19th century in such forms as pamphlets, yellowbacks, dime novels, and airport novels. Modern paperbacks can be differentiated from one another by size. In the United States, there are &quot;mass-market paperbacks&quot; and larger, more durable &quot;trade paperbacks&quot;. In the United Kingdom, there are A-format, B-format, and the largest C-format sizes.

Paperback editions of books are issued when a publisher decides to release a book in a low-cost format. Lower-quality paper, glued (rather than stapled or sewn) bindings, and the lack of a hard cover may contribute to the lower cost of paperbacks. In the early days of modern paperbacks, the 1930s and 1940s, they were sold as a cheaper, less permanent, and more convenient alternative to traditional hardcover books, as the name of the first American paperback publisher, Pocket Books, indicates. In addition, the Pocket Books edition of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, one of the first ten books it published in 1939, emphasized the impermanence of paperbacks by telling readers if you &quot;enjoyed it so much you may wish to own it in a more permanent edition&quot;, they could return the 25 cent book to Pocket Books with an additional 70 cents and it would send them a copy of the 95 cent Modern Library edition &quot;substantially bound in durable cloth.&quot;

Since the mid-20th century, paperbacks can also be the preferred medium when a book is not expected to be a major seller and the publisher wishes to release the book without a large investment. Examples include many novels and newer editions or reprintings of older books.

Because paperbacks tend to have smaller profit margins, many publishers try to balance the profit to be made by selling fewer hardcovers against the potential profit to be made by selling more paperbacks with a smaller profit per unit. First editions of many modern books, especially genre fiction, are issued in paperback. Best-selling books, on the other hand, may maintain sales in hardcover for an extended period to reap the greater profits that the hardcovers provide.

==History==
The early 19th century saw numerous improvements in the printing, publishing and book-distribution processes, with the introduction of steam-powered printing presses, pulp mills, automatic type setting, and a network of railways. These innovations enabled the likes of Simms and McIntyre of Belfast, Routledge &amp; Sons (founded in 1836) and Ward &amp; Lock (founded in 1854) to mass-produce cheap uniform yellowback or paperback editions of existing works, and distribute and sell them across the British Isles, principally via the ubiquitous W. H. Smith &amp; Sons newsagent found at most urban British railway stations. These paper bound volumes were offered for sale at a fraction of the historical cost of a book, and were of a smaller format, , aimed at the railway traveller. The Routledge&#x27;s Railway Library series of paperbacks remained in print until 1898, and offered the traveling public 1,277 unique titles.

The Continental market also supported examples of cheap paper-bound books: 
Bernhard Tauchnitz started the Collection of British and American Authors in 1841. These inexpensive, paperbound editions, a direct precursor to mass-market paperbacks, eventually ran to over 5,000 volumes. Reclam published Shakespeare in this format from October 1857 and went on to pioneer the mass market paperbound &quot;Universal-Bibliothek&quot; series from 10 November 1867.

===The early years: 1930‚Äì1950===
The German publisher Albatross Books revised the 20th-century mass-market paperback format in 1931, but the approach of World War II cut the experiment short. Albatross&#x27;s innovations included a standardized size, use of new sans-serif fonts, use of logo and type on the cover without an illustration, and color-coding the covers by genre.
In 1935, British publisher Allen Lane, investing his own capital, initiated the paperback revolution in the English-language book market by releasing ten reprint titles to launch the Penguin Books imprint. They adopted many of Albatross&#x27;s innovations, including a conspicuous logo, using only type on the cover, and color-coded covers for different genres.

The first book on Penguin&#x27;s 1935 list was Andr√© Maurois&#x27; &quot;Ariel&quot;.

Lane intended to produce inexpensive books. He purchased paperback rights from publishers, ordered large print runs (such as 20,000 copies‚Äîlarge for the time) to keep unit prices low, and looked to non-traditional book-selling retail locations. Booksellers were initially reluctant to buy his books, but when Woolworths placed a large order, the books sold extremely well. After that initial success, booksellers showed more willingness to stock paperbacks, and the name &quot;Penguin&quot; became closely associated with the word &quot;paperback&quot; in Great Britain.

In the United States, Robert de Graaf created the Pocket Books label in 1939, partnering with Simon &amp; Schuster to issue a similar line of reprints. Because at first Pocket Books was the only publisher of paperbacks, the term &quot;pocket book&quot; became synonymous with paperback in English-speaking North America. (In France, the term &quot;livre de poche&quot;, which translates as &quot;pocket book&quot;, was used and is still in use today.) De Graaf, like Lane, negotiated paperback rights from other publishers, and produced many runs. His practices contrasted with those of Lane by his adoption of illustrated covers aimed at the North American market. To reach an even broader market than Lane, he used distributors of newspapers and magazines to distribute his books because they had a lengthy history of being aimed (in format and distribution) at mass audiences. Pocket Books were not available in book stores because they did not carry magazines.

Pocket Books established the format for all subsequent paperback publishers in the 1940s. The books measured 6.5&quot; by 4.25&quot; (16.5¬†cm by 10.8¬†cm), had full-color covers, and cost 25 cents. Eventually in the 1950s the height increased by 0.5&quot; (1.4¬†cm) to 7&quot; (18¬†cm). The width remained the same because wire display racks used in many locations could not hold wider books. With the larger size came a higher price, first 35 cents and then 50 cents.

Because of its number-one position in what became a very long list of pocket editions, James Hilton&#x27;s &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; is often cited as the first American paperback book. However, the first mass-market, pocket-sized, paperback book printed in the U.S. was an edition of Pearl Buck&#x27;s &quot;The Good Earth&quot;, produced by Pocket Books as a proof-of-concept in late 1938, and sold in New York City.

The first ten Pocket Book titles published in May 1939 with a print run of about 10,000 copies each were:
#&quot;Lost Horizon&quot; (1933) by James Hilton
#&quot;Wake Up and Live&quot; (1936) by Dorothea Brande
#&quot;Five Great Tragedies&quot; by William Shakespeare
#&quot;Topper&quot; (1926) by Thorne Smith
#&quot;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&quot; (1926) by Agatha Christie
#&quot;Enough Rope&quot; (1926) by Dorothy Parker
#&quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; (1847) by Emily Bront√´
#&quot;The Way of All Flesh&quot; (1903) by Samuel Butler
#&quot;The Bridge of San Luis Rey&quot; (1927) by Thornton Wilder
#&quot;Bambi&quot; (1928 English translation) by Felix Salten

This list includes seven novels, the most recent being six year old (&quot;Lost Horizons&quot;, 1933), two classics (Shakespeare and &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, both out of copyright), one mystery novel, one book of poetry (&quot;Enough Rope&quot;), and one self-help book.

The success of Pocket Books led to others entering the market. In 1941, American News Company, a magazine distributor, bought a dime novel publisher partially owned by brother and sister Joseph Meyers and Edna Meyers Williams and hired them to organize a new company called &quot;Avon Publications&quot;. Avon copied the basic format established by Pocket Books but differentiated itself by emphasizing, as a book on collecting paperbacks says, &quot;popular appeal rather than loftier concepts of literary merit.&quot; In 1953, &quot;Time&quot; magazine summarized its books as &quot;westerns, whodunits, and the kind of boy-meets-girl story that can be illustrated by a ripe cheesecake jacket [cover]&quot;.

The next year Dell Publishing, which was founded in 1921 by George T. Delacorte Jr. to publish pulp magazines, joined with Western Publishing to publish Dell Books. Like Avon, Dell followed the basic format established by Pocket Books. But within that format, &quot;Dell achieved more variety than any of its early competitors [with its] . . . instantly identifiable format of vibrant airbrushed covers for its predominantly genre fiction&quot;, specialized logos and special features like maps and lists of characters.

World War II brought both new technology and a wide readership of men and women serving in the military or employed as shift workers; paperbacks were cheap, readily available, and easily posted and carried. Furthermore, people found that restrictions on travel gave them time to read more paperbacks. Four-color printing (invented in 1906) and lamination (invented in 1936) developed for military maps made the paperback cover eye catching and kept ink from running as people handled the book. A revolving metal rack (invented in 1906), designed to display a wide variety of paperbacks in a small space, found its way into drugstores, dimestores, and markets.

During World War II, the U.S. military distributed some 122 million &quot;Armed Services Editions&quot; paperback novels to the troops. After the war, the former servicemembers&#x27; familiarity with paperbacks helped popularize the format.

Two new developments changed the nature of the mass-market paperback business. One was the decision by publishers to publish more recent best selling books than the older books originally published by Pocket Book. They sought reprint rights on new books and soon found themselves in competition for the biggest sellers, leading to bidding against each other for the rights and costing them more money.

The second development was the spinner rack, a metal pole with a four-sided wire frame designed to vertically hold rows of racks of paperback books. Retail store owners no longer had to devote feet of valuable counter space to low-profit paperbacks. Dozens of paperbacks could be displayed vertically in five or six square feet of floor space. (Similar racks were available for magazines and comic books.) By the late 1940s, paperback spinner racks were ubiquitous in large and small towns across the United States, in every local grocery store, drug store, dime store, and bus and train station, displaying everything from best sellers and mysteries and westerns to classics and Shakespeare. In 1955, in William Inge&#x27;s Broadway play &quot;Bus Stop&quot;, it did not seem unbelievable that a long-distance bus traveller stranded by a snowstorm in an out-of-the-way cafe walks to a shelf and picks up a paperback copy of &quot;Four Tragedies of Shakespeare&quot;. &quot;Sometimes one can find Shakespeare on these shelves among the many lurid novels of juvenile delinquents,&quot; he comments.

In 1945, Bantam Books was formed by Walter B. Pitkin Jr., Sidney B. Kramer, and husband and wife Ian and Betty Ballantine as a mass-market paperback publisher.

The fifth major 1940s publisher of mass-market paperbacks was New American Library. Originally Penguin USA, it became a separate publisher in 1948 as the New American Library of World Literature when it separated from Penguin and Victor Weybright and Kurt Enoch took over. Its original focus was classics and scholarly works as well as popular and pulp fiction. Eventually it shortened its name to New American Library and published books in the &quot;Mentor&quot; and &quot;Signet&quot; lines.

New paperback publishers continued to enter the market - Lion Books and Pyramid Books (both 1949), Fawcett Gold Medal Books (1950), Ace Books and Ballantine Books (both 1952), and Berkley Books (1955).

U.S. paperbacks quickly entered the Canadian market. Canadian mass-market paperback initiatives in the 1940s included White Circle Books, a subsidiary of Collins (UK.); it was fairly successful but was soon outstripped by the success of Harlequin which began in 1949 and, after a few years of publishing undistinguished novels, focused on the romance genre and became one of the world&#x27;s largest publishers.

==The 1950s‚ÄîThe paperback original (fiction) revolution==

At first, paperbacks consisted entirely of reprints, but in 1950, Fawcett Publications&#x27; Gold Medal Books began publishing original fiction in mass‚Äìmarket paperback. It was revolutionary. The term paperback original applies to paperback original publications of fiction. It is not usually applied to original non‚Äìfiction publications, although paperback publishers also began issuing original non‚Äìfiction titles.

Fawcett, an independent newsstand distributor, in 1945, negotiated a contract with New American Library to distribute its Mentor and Signet titles. That contract prohibited Fawcett from becoming a competitor by publishing its own paperback reprints. Roscoe Kent Fawcett wanted to establish a line of Fawcett paperbacks, and he felt original works would not be a violation of the contract. To challenge the contract, Fawcett published two anthologies‚Äî&quot;The Best of True Magazine&quot; and &quot;What Today&#x27;s Woman Should Know About Marriage and Sex&quot;‚Äîreprinting material from Fawcett magazines not previously published in books.

After these books were successfully published, Fawcett announced in December 1949 that in February 1950 it would publish &quot;original fiction including westerns and mysteries at 25 cents in a pocket-sized format&quot; in a series called Gold Medal Books. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; reported in May 1950 that Fawcett books were &quot;similar in appearance and cover allure to many of the paperback reprints, but the story material [was] original and not reprinted from regular editions.&quot; It also said the authors would be paid a $2,000 advance with a guaranteed first printing of 200,000 copies.

That same month Fawcett released the first four Gold Medal books, original novels by W. R. Burnett, Sax Rohmer, Richard Himmel, and John Flagg - one western and three mysteries/adventure novels.

Fawcett&#x27;s action led to immediate controversy, with an executive Vice president of Pocket Books attacking the whole idea, a literary agent reporting that one hardcover publisher threatened to boycott his agency if he dealt with mass market publishers, and Doubleday&#x27;s LeBaron R. Barker claiming that paperback originals could &quot;undermine the whole structure of publishing.&quot;

Sales soared, prompting Gold Medal editorial director Ralph Daigh to comment later, &quot;In the past six months we have produced 9,020,645 books, and people seem to like them very well.&quot; In 1950 Gold Medal published 35 titles, in 1952, 66.

Other paperback publishers saw Gold Medal&#x27;s success and began to emulate it. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; reported in May 1952 that Avon had included three originals in its April releases and was seeking more. It added that Dell was thinking about&#x27; some systematic programs of original publishing,&quot; Lion Books had &quot;a definite original publishing program in the works&quot;, and that Graphic had begun publishing originals about a year earlier. Bantam, Pocket Books, and New American Library said they were not going to publish originals.

Also in 1952, Ace began publishing Ace Double Novel Books, two books printed in one volume for 35 cents, one a reprint and one original, with two covers and two title pages.

In 1952, husband and wife publishers Ian and Betty Ballantine left Bantam Books and founded their own publishing house, Ballantine Books, to publish paperbacks simultaneously with their publication in hardcover by traditional publishers. Their first book, Cameron Hawley&#x27;s &quot;Executive Suite&quot;, published January 1, 1952 at 35 cents in the 7&quot; height simultaneously with Houghton Mifflin&#x27;s $3.00 hardcover edition, was a success for both publishers. Of their next nine novels, two were published simultaneously by Houghton Mifflin and one by Farrar, Straus &amp; Young and six were stand-alone originals.

In 1953, Dell announced its line of originals, Dell First Editions, and published its first novels by Walt Grove, Frederic Brown, and Charles Einstein.

Genre categories began to emerge, and mass-market book covers reflected those categories. Mass-market paperbacks influenced slick and pulp magazines. The market for cheap magazines diminished when buyers began to buy cheap books instead. Authors also found themselves abandoning magazines and writing for the paperback market. The leading paperback publishers often hired experienced pulp magazine cover artists, including Rudolph Belarski and Earle K. Bergey, who helped create the look and feel of paperbacks and set an appealing visual standard that continues to this day. Scores of well-known authors were published in paperback, including Arthur Miller and John Steinbeck.

McClelland and Stewart entered the Canadian mass-market book trade in the early 1960s, with its &quot;Canadian best seller library&quot; series, at a time when Canadian literary culture was beginning to be popularized, and a call for a Canadian author identity was discussed by the Canadian people.

==Types==
=== Mass-market ===

The mass-market paperback is a small, usually non-illustrated, inexpensive bookbinding format. This includes the A-format books of , in the United Kingdom, and the &quot;pocketbook&quot; format books of a similar size, in the United States. Mass-market paperbacks usually are printed on cheap paper. They are commonly released after the hardback edition and often sold not only at bookstores, but also where books are not the main business, such as at airports, drugstores, and supermarkets.

In 1982, romance novels accounted for at least 25% of all paperback sales. In 2013, 51% of paperback sales were romance. Many titles, especially in genre fiction, have their first editions in paperback and are never published in hardcover; this is particularly true of first novels by new authors.

The mass-market paperbacks sold in airport newsstands have given rise to the vaguely defined literary genre of the &quot;airport novel&quot;, bought by travelers to read while they sit and wait. Mass-market paperbacks also have offered collections of comic strips and magazine cartoon series, such as Ernie Bushmiller&#x27;s &quot;Nancy&quot; and Chon Day&#x27;s &quot;Brother Sebastian&quot;.

=== B-format ===
The term B-format indicates a medium-sized paperback of . This size has been used to distinguish literary novels from genre fiction. In the U.S., books of this size are thought of as smaller trade paperbacks (see below).

=== Trade paperback ===

A trade paperback (also called &quot;trade paper edition&quot; and &quot;trade&quot;) is a higher-quality paperback book. If it is a softcover edition of a previous hardcover edition and is published by the same house as the hardcover, the text pages are normally identical with those of the hardcover edition, and the book is almost the same size as the hardcover edition. The pagination is the same, so that references to the text will be unchanged: this is particularly important for reviewers and scholars. The only difference is the soft binding; the paper is usually of higher quality than that of a mass-market paperback, often being acid-free paper. In the United States, the term &quot;trade paperback&quot; also encompasses the medium-sized paperbacks described as B-format, above. British trade paperbacks are .

Trade paperbacks did not enter the American market until around 1960. Unlike mass-market paperbacks they are distributed by their original hard-cover publishers directly to book stores, not through magazine distributors to other retailers.

====Trade comics====

Trade paperbacks are often used to reprint several issues of a comic series in one volume, usually an important storyline or the entire series, and the name &quot;trade paperback&quot; has become synonymous with a collection of reprinted material. Graphic novels may also be printed in trade paperback form. Publishers sometimes release popular collections first in a hardback form, followed by a trade paperback months later. Examples include Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;Secret War&quot; and DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Watchmen&quot;.

Japanese manga, when they are collected into volumes, are published in the &quot;tank≈çbon&quot; format, approximately the size of a trade-sized book. The most common sizes are Japanese B6 (128 √ó 182¬†mm) and ISO A5 (148 √ó 210¬†mm).

<doc id="238676" wikidata="Q3240280" url="?curid=238676" title="Direct proof">
<text>In mathematics and logic, a direct proof is a way of showing the
truth or falsehood of a given statement by a straightforward combination of
established facts, usually axioms, existing lemmas and theorems, without making any further assumptions. In order to directly prove a conditional statement of the form &quot;If &quot;p&quot;, then &quot;q&quot;&quot;, it suffices to consider the situations in which the statement &quot;p&quot; is true. Logical deduction is employed to reason from assumptions to conclusion. The type of logic employed is almost invariably first-order logic, employing the quantifiers &quot;for all&quot; and &quot;there exists&quot;. Common proof rules used are modus ponens and universal instantiation.

In contrast, an indirect proof may begin with certain hypothetical scenarios and then proceed to eliminate the uncertainties in each of these scenarios until an inescapable conclusion is forced. For example, instead of showing directly &quot;p&quot; ‚áí &quot;q&quot;, one proves its contrapositive ~&quot;q&quot; ‚áí ~&quot;p&quot; (one assumes ~&quot;q&quot; and shows that it leads to ~&quot;p&quot;). Since &quot;p&quot; ‚áí &quot;q&quot; and ~&quot;q&quot; ‚áí ~&quot;p&quot; are equivalent by the principle of transposition (see law of excluded middle), &quot;p&quot; ‚áí &quot;q&quot; is indirectly proved. Proof methods that are not direct include proof by contradiction, including proof by infinite descent. Direct proof methods include proof by exhaustion and proof by induction.

==History and etymology==
A direct proof is the simplest form of proof there is. The word ‚Äòproof‚Äô comes from the Latin word probare, which means ‚Äúto test‚Äù. The earliest use of proofs was prominent in legal proceedings. A person with authority, such as a nobleman, was said to have probity, which means that the evidence was by his relative authority, which outweighed empirical testimony. In days gone by, mathematics and proof was often intertwined with practical questions ‚Äì with populations like the Egyptians and the Greeks showing an interest in surveying land. This led to a natural curiosity with regards to geometry and trigonometry ‚Äì particularly triangles and rectangles. These were the shapes which provided the most questions in terms of practical things, so early geometrical concepts were focused on these shapes, for example, the likes of buildings and pyramids used these shapes in abundance. Another shape which is crucial in the history of direct proof is the circle, which was crucial for the design of arenas and water tanks. This meant that ancient geometry (and Euclidean Geometry) discussed circles.

The earliest form of mathematics was phenomenological. For example, if someone could draw a reasonable picture, or give a convincing description, then that met all the criteria for something to be described as a mathematical ‚Äúfact‚Äù. On occasion, analogical arguments took place, or even by ‚Äúinvoking the gods‚Äù. The idea that mathematical statements could be proven had not been developed yet, so these were the earliest forms of the concept of proof, despite not being actual proof at all.

Proof as we know it came about with one specific question: ‚Äúwhat is a proof?‚Äù Traditionally, a proof is a platform which convinces someone beyond reasonable doubt that a statement is mathematically true. Naturally, one would assume that the best way to prove the truth of something like this (B) would be to draw up a comparison with something old (A) that has already been proven as true. Thus was created the concept of deriving a new result from an old result.

==Examples==

===The sum of two even integers equals an even integer===

Consider two even integers and . Since they are even, they can be written as

:formula_1
:formula_2

respectively for integers and . 
Then the sum can be written as

:formula_3 where formula_4, and are all integers.
It follows that has 2 as a factor and therefore is even, so the sum of any two even integers is even.

===Pythagoras&#x27; theorem===

Observe that we have four right-angled triangles and a square packed into a larger square. Each of the triangles has sides &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; and hypotenuse &quot;c&quot;. The area of a square is defined as the square of the length of its sides. In this case, the area of the large square is &quot;(a + b)2&quot;. However, the area of the large square can also be expressed as the sum of the areas of its components. In this case, that would be the sum of the areas of the four triangles and the small square in the middle.

We know that the area of the large square is equal to &quot;(a + b)2&quot;.

The area of a right triangle is equal to formula_5

We know that the area of the large square is also equal to the sum of the areas of the triangles, plus the area of the small square, and thus the area of the large square equals formula_6

These are equal, and so

::formula_7

After some simplifying,

::formula_8

Removing the 2ab that appears on both sides gives

::formula_9

which proves Pythagoras&#x27; theorem. ‚àé

=== The square of an odd number is also odd ===

By definition, if &quot;n&quot; is an odd integer, it can be expressed as
:formula_10
for some integer &quot;k&quot;. Thus

:formula_11
Since 2&quot;k&quot;2+ 2&quot;k&quot; is an integer, &quot;n&quot;2 is also odd. ‚àé

<doc id="238680" wikidata="Q170431" url="?curid=238680" title="Avogadro's law">
<text>Avogadro&#x27;s law (sometimes referred to as Avogadro&#x27;s hypothesis or Avogadro&#x27;s principle) or Avogadro-Amp√®re&#x27;s hypothesis is an experimental gas law relating the volume of a gas to the amount of substance of gas present. The law is a specific case of the ideal gas law. A modern statement is:

Avogadro&#x27;s law states that &quot;equal volumes of all gases, at the same temperature and pressure, have the same number of molecules.&quot;

For a given mass of an ideal gas, the volume and amount (moles) of the gas are directly proportional if the temperature and pressure are constant.
The law is named after Amedeo Avogadro who, in 1812, hypothesized that two given samples of an ideal gas, of the same volume and at the same temperature and pressure, contain the same number of molecules. As an example, equal volumes of gaseous hydrogen and nitrogen contain the same number of molecules when they are at the same temperature and pressure, and display ideal gas behavior. In practice, real gases show small deviations from the ideal behavior and the law holds only approximately, but is still a useful approximation for scientists.

==Mathematical definition==
The law can be written as:

:formula_1
or
:formula_2

where
*&quot;V&quot; is the volume of the gas;
*&quot;n&quot; is the amount of substance of the gas (measured in moles);
*&quot;k&quot; is a constant for a given temperature and pressure.

This law describes how, under the same condition of temperature and pressure, equal volumes of all gases contain the same number of molecules. For comparing the same substance under two different sets of conditions, the law can be usefully expressed as follows:

:formula_3

The equation shows that, as the number of moles of gas increases, the volume of the gas also increases in proportion. Similarly, if the number of moles of gas is decreased, then the volume also decreases. Thus, the number of molecules or atoms in a specific volume of ideal gas is independent of their size or the molar mass of the gas.

=== Derivation from the ideal gas law ===
The derivation of Avogadro&#x27;s law follows directly from the ideal gas law, i.e.
:formula_4
where &quot;R&quot; is the gas constant, &quot;T&quot; is the Kelvin temperature, and &quot;P&quot; is the pressure (in pascals).

Solving for &quot;V/n&quot;, we thus obtain
:formula_5
Compare that to
:formula_6
which is a constant for a fixed pressure and a fixed temperature.

An equivalent formulation of the ideal gas law can be written using Boltzmann constant &quot;k&quot;B, as
:formula_7
where &quot;N&quot; is the number of particles in the gas, and the ratio of &quot;R&quot; over &quot;k&quot;B is equal to the Avogadro constant.

In this form, for &quot;V/N&quot; is a constant, we have
:formula_8
If &quot;T&quot; and &quot;P&quot; are taken at standard conditions for temperature and pressure (STP), then &quot;k&quot;‚Ä≤ = 1/&quot;n&quot;0, where &quot;n&quot;0 is the Loschmidt constant.

==Historical account and influence==
Avogadro&#x27;s hypothesis (as it was known originally) was formulated in the same spirit of earlier empirical gas laws like Boyle&#x27;s law (1662), Charles&#x27;s law (1787) and Gay-Lussac&#x27;s law (1808). The hypothesis was first published by Amedeo Avogadro in 1811, and it reconciled Dalton atomic theory with the &quot;incompatible&quot; idea of Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac that some gases were composite of different fundamental substances (molecules) in integer proportions. In 1814, independently from Avogadro, Andr√©-Marie Amp√®re published the same law with similar conclusions. As Amp√®re was more well known in France, the hypothesis was usually referred there as Amp√®re&#x27;s hypothesis, and later also as Avogadro‚ÄìAmp√®re hypothesis or even Amp√®re‚ÄìAvogadro hypothesis.

Experimental studies carried out by Charles Fr√©d√©ric Gerhardt and Auguste Laurent on organic chemistry demonstrated that Avogadro&#x27;s law explained why the same quantities of molecules in a gas have the same volume. Nevertheless, related experiments with some inorganic substances showed seeming exceptions to the law. This apparent contradiction was finally resolved by Stanislao Cannizzaro, as announced at Karlsruhe Congress in 1860, four years after Avogadro&#x27;s death. He explained that these exceptions were due to molecular dissociations at certain temperatures, and that Avogadro&#x27;s law determined not only molecular masses, but atomic masses as well.

=== Ideal gas law ===
Boyle, Charles and Gay-Lussac laws, together with Avogadro&#x27;s law, were combined by √âmile Clapeyron in 1834, giving rise to the ideal gas law. At the end of the 19th century, later developments from scientists like August Kr√∂nig, Rudolf Clausius, James Clerk Maxwell and Ludwig Boltzmann, gave rise to the kinetic theory of gases, a microscopic theory from which the ideal gas law can be derived as an statistical result from the movement of atoms/molecules in a gas.

=== Avogadro constant ===
Avogadro&#x27;s law provides a way to calculate the quantity of gas in a receptacle. Thanks to this discovery, Johann Josef Loschmidt, in 1865, was able for the first time to estimate the size of a molecule. His calculation gave rise to the concept of the Loschmidt constant, a ratio between macroscopic and atomic quantities. In 1910, Millikan&#x27;s oil drop experiment determined the charge of the electron; using it with the Faraday constant (derived by Michael Faraday in 1834), one is able to determine the number of particles in a mole of substance. At the same time, precision experiments by Jean Baptiste Perrin led to the definition of the Avogadro number as the number of molecules in one gram-molecule of oxygen. Perrin named the number to honor Avogadro for his discovery of the namesake law. Later standardization of the International System of Units led to the modern definition of the Avogadro constant.

==Molar volume==

At standard temperature and pressure (100¬†kPa and 273.15¬†K), we can use Avogadro&#x27;s law to find the molar volume of an ideal gas:

:formula_9

Similarly, at standard atmospheric pressure (101.325¬†kPa) and 0¬†¬∞C (273.15 K):

:formula_10

<doc id="238682" wikidata="Q508291" url="?curid=238682" title="Simplicity">
<text>Simplicity is the state or quality of being . Something easy to understand or explain seems simple, in contrast to something complicated. Alternatively, as Herbert A. Simon suggests, something is simple or complex depending on the way we choose to describe it. In some uses, the label &quot;simplicity&quot; can imply beauty, purity, or clarity. In other cases, the term may suggest a lack of nuance or complexity relative to what is required.

The concept of simplicity is related to the field of epistemology and philosophy of science (e.g., in Occam&#x27;s razor). Religions also reflect on simplicity with concepts such as divine simplicity. In human lifestyles, simplicity can denote freedom from excessive possessions or distractions, such as having a simple living style. In some cases, the term may have negative connotations, as when referring to someone as a simpleton.

==In philosophy of science==
There is a widespread philosophical presumption that simplicity is a theoretical virtue. This presumption that simpler theories are preferable appears in many guises. Often it remains implicit; sometimes it is invoked as a primitive, self-evident proposition; other times it is elevated to the status of a ‚ÄòPrinciple‚Äô and labeled as such (for example, the &#x27;Principle of Parsimony&#x27;.

According to Occam&#x27;s razor, all other things being equal, the &quot;simplest&quot; theory is most likely true. In other words, simplicity is a meta-scientific criterion by which scientists evaluate competing theories.

A distinction is often made by many persons between two senses of simplicity: syntactic simplicity (the number and complexity of hypotheses), and ontological simplicity (the number and complexity of things postulated). These two aspects of simplicity are often referred to as elegance and parsimony respectively.

John von Neumann defines simplicity as an important esthetic criterion of scientific models: 

==In business==
The recognition that too much complexity can have a negative effect on business performance was highlighted in research undertaken in 2011 by Simon Collinson of the Warwick Business School and the Simplicity Partnership, which found that managers who are orientated towards finding ways of making business &quot;simpler and more straightforward&quot; can have a beneficial impact on their organisation.

Collinson identified a role for &quot;simplicity-minded managers&quot;, managers who were &quot;predisposed towards simplicity&quot;, and identified a set of characteristics related to the role, namely &quot;ruthless prioritisation&quot;, the ability to say &quot;no&quot;, willingness to iterate, to reduce communication to the essential points of a message and the ability to engage a team. His report, the &quot;Global Simplicity Index 2011&quot;, was the first ever study to calculate the cost of complexity in the world&#x27;s largest organisations.

The &quot;Global Simplicity Index&quot; identified that complexity occurs in five key areas of an organisation: people, processes, organisational design, strategy, and products and services. As the &quot;global brands report&quot;, the research is repeated and published annually. The 2022 report incorporates a &quot;brand simplicity score&quot; and an &quot;industry simplicity score&quot;.

Research by Ioannis Evmoiridis at Tilburg University found that earnings reported by &quot;high simplicity firms&quot; are higher than among other businesses, and that such firms &quot;exhibit[ed] a superior performance during the period 2010 - 2015&quot;, whilst requiring lower average capital expenditure and lower leverage.

==In religion==
Simplicity is a theme in the Christian religion. According to St. Thomas Aquinas, God is infinitely simple. The Roman Catholic and Anglican religious orders of Franciscans also strive for personal simplicity. Members of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) practice the Testimony of Simplicity, which involves simplifying one&#x27;s life to focus on what is important and disregard or avoid what is least important. Simplicity is tenet of Anabaptistism, and some Anabaptist groups like the Bruderhof, make an effort to live simply.

==Lifestyle==

In the context of human lifestyle, simplicity can denote freedom from excessive material consumption and psychological distractions.

<text>Ozone Park is a neighborhood in the southwestern section of the New York City borough of Queens, New York, United States. It is next to the Aqueduct Racetrack in South Ozone Park, a popular spot for Thoroughbred racing and home to the Resorts World Casino &amp; Hotel. Home to a large Italian-American population, Ozone Park has also grown in recent decades to have many residents of Caribbean, Hispanic, and Asian backgrounds.

While New York City neighborhoods do not have formal boundaries, Ozone Park is considered to have a northern border at Atlantic Avenue; the southern border is North Conduit Avenue, the western border is the Brooklyn/Queens border line; and the eastern border is up to 108th Street and Aqueduct Racetrack.

Ozone Park is in two community districts, divided by Liberty and 103rd Avenues. The southern half of the neighborhood is in Queens Community District 10, which is covered by New York City Police Department&#x27;s 106th Precinct, while the northern half is in Queens Community District 9 and covered by the NYPD&#x27;s 102nd Precinct. Its ZIP Codes are 11416 and 11417.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Ozone Park&quot; was chosen for the development to &quot;lure buyers with the idea of refreshing breezes blowing in from the Atlantic Ocean to a park-like community&quot;. At the time, ozone, now known to be a harmful pollutant at ground level, was popularly thought to be a healthful component of fresh air such as mountain or sea breezes.

==History==
===Early history===

An area now part of Ozone Park that pre-dated that community was called &quot;Centreville&quot;. It was founded in the 1840s and was centered around Centreville Street and the Centreville Community Church. Part of Ozone Park is still called &quot;Centreville&quot;.

In the 1870s, two immigrants from France named Charles Lalance and Florian Grosjean established a factory in Woodhaven where they manufactured cooking materials and porcelain enamelware. It burned down in 1876. Lalance and Grosjean built a second factory, as well as a hundred houses for workers, at Atlantic Avenue and 92nd Street in modern-day Ozone Park.

During the 1870s, an economic depression caused residents of New York City to look for better housing opportunities in the suburbs of Manhattan and Brooklyn, where housing would be cheaper. In 1880, the New York, Woodhaven &amp; Rockaway Railroad began service on the Montauk Branch and Rockaway Beach Branch from Long Island City to Howard Beach, Queens. Two years later, two wealthy partners named Benjamin W. Hitchcock and Charles C. Denton bought plots of land around what would later become the Woodhaven Junction station. The Rockaway Beach Branch&#x27;s Ozone Park station opened in 1883.

Advertisements for Ozone Park proclaimed that the development had &quot;pure air&quot; and &quot;no malaria&quot;. Ozone Park was called &quot;the Harlem of Brooklyn&quot; because at the time, as Harlem was a thriving Jewish and Italian neighborhood. Hitchcock and Denton chose the &quot;Ozone Park&quot; name because in the 1880s, ozone was associated with breezes from the sea, and the Atlantic Ocean was located nearby.

===Development===

The Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company&#x27;s Fulton Street elevated railroad line above Liberty Avenue opened in 1915, with a station at Lefferts Avenue (now Lefferts Boulevard). The elevated train system only charged a 5-cent fare. The nickel fare was another major factor in the development of Ozone Park, as residents could travel across the entire elevated and subway system for 5 cents. After the opening of the elevated line, real estate developers began buying up all the lots on either side of Liberty Avenue in hopes the new station would attract more people to want to live in Ozone Park.

Extensive housing construction occurred in the 1920s. The houses featured enclosed front porches, open back porches and stained-glass windows in the living rooms. Most of the houses were single family detached or semi-detached (sharing a common wall, often called a twin or a semi) built to roughly the same plan, with the living room, dining room and kitchen all in line and three bedrooms and a bath upstairs. The stairs were usually in the dining room.
During the 1920s, Woodhaven Avenue was the main north‚Äìsouth artery in the area, though its southern terminus was at Liberty Avenue. In conjunction with the extension of Woodhaven Avenue to the Rockaway Peninsula, the avenue was widened to and renamed Woodhaven Boulevard. The extension itself, named Cross Bay Boulevard, opened to traffic in 1925.

Because Ozone Park was now more accessible by car, the land became much more valuable, leading to a construction boom . Between 1921 and 1930, Ozone Park saw a population increase of over 180% from 40,000 to 112,950 people.

With this increase in population came the need for schools and sources of entertainment. In response to this demand came the construction of John Adams High School in 1930. This school was built just as the construction boom slowed down and right before the Great Depression. The 1,800-seat Cross-Bay Movie Theatre opened in December 1924, and a 2,000-seat theater at 102nd Street and Liberty Avenue was also built during this time.

One area of Ozone Park is known as &quot;The Hole&quot;, and includes the area bounded by 75th (Ruby) Street, South Conduit Avenue, 78th Street and Linden Boulevard. It is named as such because the houses in this area were built below grade, with a ground level that is lower than the surrounding area. The area is run-down, and suffers from frequent flooding. In the 1930s, the city of New York decided to install sewers and sewer lines in Ozone Park to stop the flooding that had become a major problem. In order to install the sewers, the houses had to be raised almost an entire floor. Owners were given a stipend to raise their homes but some chose not to do so. The first floor in some of the non-raised homes subsequently became basements. In 2004, the New York City Department of Environmental Protection made plans to connect the neighborhood to the city&#x27;s sewer system to combat the flooding by raising the land.

===Later years===
The Centreville Community Church merged with the United Methodist Church of Ozone Park in 1957 and a new church, the Community Methodist Church of Ozone Park, was built at the Southeast corner of Sutter Avenue and Cross Bay Boulevard. It was completed for Christmas 1958. The old church and the property that surrounded it were sold to Aqueduct Racetrack and the old, historic church was torn down in mid-1959.

The Lalance and Grosjean factory closed in the 1960s and was left to deteriorate over two decades. In 1981, the factory complex was designated as a New York City Landmark. What remains is now &quot;adaptively reused&quot; as a medical clinic. Only the factory&#x27;s old clock tower remains.

In 1996, a scandal broke surrounding two Ozone Park Jewish cemeteries, Mokom Sholom Cemetery and Bayside Cemetery, which share a coterminous tract bounded by 80th and 84th Streets and Liberty and Pitkin Avenues (the adjoining Acacia Cemetery was not involved). Allegations of the re-using of graves of long-dead mostly infants and small children from the mid-to-late 19th century, for re-sale to recent Russian Jewish immigrants, were made against the owners of Mokom Sholom. In addition, Mokom Sholom and Bayside had also been damaged by a combination of vandals, grave-robbers, and self-styled necromancers, though the former was affected to a greater extent. WABC-TV reported on damage to Mokom Sholom, while damage to Bayside was repaired through philanthropic efforts, headed by the late city councilman Al C. Stabile.

== Demographics ==
Based on data from the 2010 United States census, the population of Ozone Park was 21,376, an increase of 324 (1.5%) from the 21,052 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of .

The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 30.5% (6,511) White, 5.6% (1,188) African American, 0.4% (82) Native American, 19.4% (4,143) Asian, 0.0% (2) Pacific Islander, 2.6% (559) from other races, and 3.6% (779) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 37.9% (8,112) of the population.

The entirety of Community Board 10, which comprises Howard Beach, southern Ozone Park (south of 103rd Avenue), and South Ozone Park, had 125,603 inhabitants as of NYC Health&#x27;s 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 81.7 years. This is higher than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are youth and middle-aged adults: 22% are between the ages of between 0‚Äì17, 28% between 25 and 44, and 28% between 45 and 64. The ratio of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, at 9% and 13% respectively.

As of 2017, the median household income in Community Board 10 was $73,891. In 2018, an estimated 19% of Ozone Park and Howard Beach residents lived in poverty, compared to 19% in all of Queens and 20% in all of New York City. One in ten residents (10%) were unemployed, compared to 8% in Queens and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 56% in Howard Beach and South Ozone Park, higher than the boroughwide and citywide rates of 53% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , Ozone Park and Howard Beach are considered to be high-income relative to the rest of the city and not gentrifying.

=== Demographic changes ===

Since its beginnings, Ozone Park has been largely populated by various groups of immigrants. The first wave were French immigrants associated with a pot factory on Atlantic Avenue. Germans and the Irish made up a large part of Ozone Park in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Eventually Italians started to migrate into Ozone Park from East New York, Brooklyn. Most of the current Italians in the neighborhood are originally from Brooklyn. A significant Polish population also developed based around Saint Stanislaus Bishop and Martyr Roman Catholic Church and its associated elementary school.

At the turn of the 21st century immigrants from Latin America, South Asia (Bangladesh), the West Indies, and South America (Indo-Guyanese &amp; Indo-Surinamese) moved in, adding a diverse atmosphere to the neighborhood, which is especially apparent along 101st Avenue and Liberty Avenue near the neighborhood&#x27;s border with Richmond Hill. The neighborhood was largely Italian-American; however, these new arrivals have made Ozone Park become one of the fastest-growing and most ethnically diverse neighborhoods in New York City. There is a large Hispanic population in Ozone Park, mainly concentrated in the northern portion of the neighborhood near the Woodhaven border, and an African-American minority, spread throughout the neighborhood.

Residents vary from working class to middle class families, who own or rent private homes on the neighborhood&#x27;s tree-lined residential streets.

==Subsections==

Census data from the late 18th century shows how Ozone Park was a sparsely populated neighborhood because of the lack of transportation. By 1915, the Fulton Street Line opened, connecting Ozone Park with the rest of New York City, thus starting the enormous influx by the Italians. Ozone Park then formed many smaller sub-neighborhoods with specific identities. 

=== Other sections ===
Centreville, which still uses this name, is bordered by Aqueduct on the east, Cross Bay Boulevard on the west, North Conduit Avenue on the south, and Rockaway Boulevard on the north. Liberty Heights is a triangular area bordered by Liberty Avenue on the south, diagonal-running 101st Avenue (Jerome Avenue) from the southwest to the northeast, and Woodhaven Boulevard to the east. Balsam Village was named after Balsam Farms, which sold off parcels of land for development, and is bordered by Liberty Avenue and North Conduit Avenue on the north, 84th Street on the west, and Cross Bay Boulevard on the east.

Tudor Village, in southwestern Ozone Park, is extremely small, consisting of approximately two hundred and fifty homes; it spans only five residential streets and two avenues. Its population consists mostly of Italian Americans. Its residents consist of approximately six hundred people. The village was incorporated in the late 1800s and has since flourished. Tudor Village hosts suburban tree-lined streets with what is referred to as the &quot;Tudor Malls&quot; in its center, boasting floral arrangements throughout.

The village is also home to Tudor Park, a recreational park which features a baseball field, racquetball courts, picnic area, and a fountain as well as a playground. Located on the southeast end of the village are another baseball field and benches and shaded areas for resting. Tudor Village is on the border of Howard Beach.

Also inside of Ozone Park are areas named Magnolia Court (95th Street and 150th Road), Park Village (Tahoe Street and North Conduit Avenue), Kaybern Court (97-52 75th Street), Ozone Plaza (84-23 103rd Avenue), Dumont Village (Dumont Avenue and 85th Street), Greentree Condos (Albert Road and 95 Street), Albert Gardens (94-20 Albert Road), Newlyn Estates (85-22 Dumont Avenue), and Sterling Manor (105-25 88th Street).

In the 1980s, the 106th Precinct became the source and scene of several police brutality incidents, including the stun gunning of high schooler Mark Davidson on April 17, 1985, who was arrested on marijuana possession charges. One of the officers, Michael Aranda, accused of stun-gunning Davidson was later acquitted
in 1991.

<doc id="238685" wikidata="Q27205" url="?curid=238685" title="Fibrin">
<text>Fibrin (also called Factor Ia) is a fibrous, non-globular protein involved in the clotting of blood. It is formed by the action of the protease thrombin on fibrinogen, which causes it to polymerize. The polymerized fibrin, together with platelets, forms a hemostatic plug or clot over a wound site.

When the lining of a blood vessel is broken, platelets are attracted, forming a platelet plug. These platelets have thrombin receptors on their surfaces that bind serum thrombin molecules, which in turn convert soluble fibrinogen in the serum into fibrin at the wound site. Fibrin forms long strands of tough insoluble protein that are bound to the platelets. Factor XIII completes the cross-linking of fibrin so that it hardens and contracts. The cross-linked fibrin forms a mesh atop the platelet plug that completes the clot. Fibrin was discovered by Marcello Malpighi in 1666.

== Role in disease ==

Excessive generation of fibrin due to activation of the coagulation cascade leads to thrombosis, the blockage of a vessel by an agglutination of red blood cells, platelets, polymerized fibrin and other components. Ineffective generation or premature lysis of fibrin increases the likelihood of a hemorrhage.

Dysfunction or disease of the liver can lead to a decrease in the production of fibrin&#x27;s inactive precursor, fibrinogen, or to the production of abnormal fibrinogen molecules with reduced activity (dysfibrinogenaemia). Hereditary abnormalities of fibrinogen (the gene is carried on chromosome 4) are both quantitative and qualitative in nature and include afibrinogenaemia, hypofibrinogenaemia, dysfibrinogenaemia, and hypodysfibrinogenemia.

Reduced, absent, or dysfunctional fibrin is likely to render patients as hemophiliacs.

== Physiology ==
Fibrin from various different animal sources is generally glycosylated with complex type biantennary asparagine-linked glycans. Variety is found in the degree of core fucosylation and in the type of sialic acid and galactose linkage.

== Structure ==
Fibrin is formed after thrombin cleavage of fibrinopeptide A (FPA) from fibrinogen Aalpha-chains, thus initiating fibrin polymerization. Double-stranded fibrils form through end-to-middle domain (D:E) associations, and concomitant lateral fibril associations and branching create a clot network. Fibrin assembly facilitates intermolecular antiparallel C-terminal alignment of gamma-chain pairs, which are then covalently &#x27;cross-linked&#x27; by factor XIII (&#x27;plasma protransglutaminase&#x27;) or XIIIa to form &#x27;gamma-dimers&#x27;. The image at the left is a crystal structure of the double-d fragment from human fibrin with two bound ligands. The experimental method used to obtain the image was X-ray diffraction, and it has a resolution of 2.30 √Ö. The structure is mainly made up of single alpha helices shown in red and beta sheets shown in yellow. The two blue structures are the bound ligands. The chemical structures of the ligands are Ca2+ ion, alpha-D-mannose (C6H12O6), and D-glucosamine (C6H13NO5).

<doc id="238686" wikidata="Q3913" url="?curid=238686" title="Binary number">
<text>A binary number is a number expressed in the [[Radix|base]]-2 [[numeral system]] or binary numeral system, a method for representing numbers that uses only two symbols for the natural numbers: typically &quot;0&quot; (zero) and &quot;1&quot; (one). A &quot;binary number&quot; may also refer to a rational number that has a finite representation in the binary numeral system, that is, the quotient of an integer by a power of two.

The base-2 numeral system is a positional notation with a radix of 2. Each digit is referred to as a bit, or binary digit. Because of its straightforward implementation in digital electronic circuitry using logic gates, the binary system is used by almost all modern computers and computer-based devices, as a preferred system of use, over various other human techniques of communication, because of the simplicity of the language and the noise immunity in physical implementation.

==History==
The modern binary number system was studied in Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries by Thomas Harriot, and Gottfried Leibniz. However, systems related to binary numbers have appeared earlier in multiple cultures including ancient Egypt, China, Europe and India.

===Egypt===
The scribes of ancient Egypt used two different systems for their fractions, Egyptian fractions (not related to the binary number system) and Horus-Eye fractions (so called because many historians of mathematics believe that the symbols used for this system could be arranged to form the eye of Horus, although this has been disputed). Horus-Eye fractions are a binary numbering system for fractional quantities of grain, liquids, or other measures, in which a fraction of a hekat is expressed as a sum of the binary fractions 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, and 1/64. Early forms of this system can be found in documents from the Fifth Dynasty of Egypt, approximately 2400 BC, and its fully developed hieroglyphic form dates to the Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt, approximately 1200 BC.

The method used for ancient Egyptian multiplication is also closely related to binary numbers. In this method, multiplying one number by a second is performed by a sequence of steps in which a value (initially the first of the two numbers) is either doubled or has the first number added back into it; the order in which these steps are to be performed is given by the binary representation of the second number. This method can be seen in use, for instance, in the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus, which dates to around 1650 BC.

===China===

The &quot;I Ching&quot; dates from the 9th century BC in China. The binary notation in the &quot;I Ching&quot; is used to interpret its quaternary divination technique.

It is based on taoistic duality of yin and yang. Eight trigrams (Bagua) and a set of 64 hexagrams (&quot;sixty-four&quot; gua), analogous to the three-bit and six-bit binary numerals, were in use at least as early as the Zhou dynasty of ancient China.

The Song dynasty scholar Shao Yong (1011‚Äì1077) rearranged the hexagrams in a format that resembles modern binary numbers, although he did not intend his arrangement to be used mathematically. Viewing the least significant bit on top of single hexagrams in Shao Yong&#x27;s square
and reading along rows either from bottom right to top left with solid lines as 0 and broken lines as 1 or from top left to bottom right with solid lines as 1 and broken lines as 0 hexagrams can be interpreted as sequence from 0 to 63.

=== Classical antiquity ===
Etruscans divided the outer edge of divination livers into sixteen parts, each inscribed with the name of a divinity and its region of the sky. Each liver region produced a binary reading which was combined into a final binary for divination. 

Divination at Ancient Greek Dodona oracle worked by drawing from separate jars, questions tablets and &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; pellets. The result was then combined to make a final prophecy.

===India===
The Indian scholar Pingala (c. 2nd century BC) developed a binary system for describing prosody. He described meters in the form of short and long syllables (the latter equal in length to two short syllables). They were known as &quot;laghu&quot; (light) and &quot;guru&quot; (heavy) syllables.

Pingala&#x27;s Hindu classic titled Chanda·∏•≈õƒÅstra (8.23) describes the formation of a matrix in order to give a unique value to each meter. &quot;Chanda·∏•≈õƒÅstra&quot; literally translates to &quot;science of meters&quot; in Sanskrit. The binary representations in Pingala&#x27;s system increases towards the right, and not to the left like in the binary numbers of the modern positional notation. In Pingala&#x27;s system, the numbers start from number one, and not zero. Four short syllables &quot;0000&quot; is the first pattern and corresponds to the value one. The numerical value is obtained by adding one to the sum of place values.

=== Africa ===
The If√° is an African divination system&quot;.&quot; Similar to the &quot;I Ching&quot;, but has up to 256 binary signs, unlike the &quot;I Ching&quot; which has 64. The If√° originated in 15th century West Africa among Yoruba people. In 2008, UNESCO added If√° to its list of the &quot;Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity&quot;.

===Other cultures===
The residents of the island of Mangareva in French Polynesia were using a hybrid binary-decimal system before 1450. Slit drums with binary tones are used to encode messages across Africa and Asia.
Sets of binary combinations similar to the &quot;I Ching&quot; have also been used in traditional African divination systems, such as If√° among others, as well as in medieval Western geomancy. The majority of Indigenous Australian languages use a base-2 system.

===Western predecessors to Leibniz===
In the late 13th century Ramon Llull had the ambition to account for all wisdom in every branch of human knowledge of the time. For that purpose he developed a general method or &quot;Ars generalis&quot; based on binary combinations of a number of simple basic principles or categories, for which he has been considered a predecessor of computing science and artificial intelligence.

In 1605, Francis Bacon discussed a system whereby letters of the alphabet could be reduced to sequences of binary digits, which could then be encoded as scarcely visible variations in the font in any random text. Importantly for the general theory of binary encoding, he added that this method could be used with any objects at all: &quot;provided those objects be capable of a twofold difference only; as by Bells, by Trumpets, by Lights and Torches, by the report of Muskets, and any instruments of like nature&quot;. (See Bacon&#x27;s cipher.)

In 1617, John Napier described a system he called location arithmetic for doing binary calculations using a non-positional representation by letters.
Thomas Harriot investigated several positional numbering systems, including binary, but did not publish his results; they were found later among his papers.
Possibly the first publication of the system in Europe was by Juan Caramuel y Lobkowitz, in 1700.

===Leibniz===

Leibniz wrote in excess of a hundred manuscripts on binary, most of them remaining unpublished. Before his first dedicated work in 1679, numerous manuscripts feature early attempts to explore binary concepts, including tables of numbers and basic calculations, often scribbled in the margins of works unrelated to mathematics.

His first known work on binary, &quot;‚ÄúOn the Binary Progression&quot;&quot;, in 1679, Leibniz introduced conversion between decimal and binary, along with algorithms for performing basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using binary numbers. He also developed a form of binary algebra to calculate the square of a six-digit number and to extract square roots.

His most well known work appears in his article &quot;Explication de l&#x27;Arithm√©tique Binaire&quot; (published in 1703).
The full title of Leibniz&#x27;s article is translated into English as the &quot;Explanation of Binary Arithmetic, which uses only the characters 1 and 0, with some remarks on its usefulness, and on the light it throws on the ancient Chinese figures of Fu Xi&quot;. Leibniz&#x27;s system uses 0 and 1, like the modern binary numeral system. An example of Leibniz&#x27;s binary numeral system is as follows:
: 0 0 0 1 ¬† numerical value 20
: 0 0 1 0 ¬† numerical value 21
: 0 1 0 0 ¬† numerical value 22
: 1 0 0 0 ¬† numerical value 23

While corresponding with the Jesuit priest Joachim Bouvet in 1700, who had made himself an expert on the &quot;I Ching&quot; while a missionary in China, Leibniz explained his binary notation, and Bouvet demonstrated in his 1701 letters that the &quot;I Ching&quot; was an independent, parallel invention of binary notation.
Leibniz &amp; Bouvet concluded that this mapping was evidence of major Chinese accomplishments in the sort of philosophical mathematics he admired. Of this parallel invention, Leibniz wrote in his &quot;Explanation Of Binary Arithmetic&quot; that &quot;this restitution of their meaning, after such a great interval of time, will seem all the more curious.&quot;

The relation was a central idea to his universal concept of a language or characteristica universalis, a popular idea that would be followed closely by his successors such as Gottlob Frege and George Boole in forming modern symbolic logic.
Leibniz was first introduced to the &quot;I Ching&quot; through his contact with the French Jesuit Joachim Bouvet, who visited China in 1685 as a missionary. Leibniz saw the &quot;I Ching&quot; hexagrams as an affirmation of the universality of his own religious beliefs as a Christian. Binary numerals were central to Leibniz&#x27;s theology. He believed that binary numbers were symbolic of the Christian idea of &quot;creatio ex nihilo&quot; or creation out of nothing.

===Later developments===

In 1854, British mathematician George Boole published a landmark paper detailing an algebraic system of logic that would become known as Boolean algebra. His logical calculus was to become instrumental in the design of digital electronic circuitry.

In 1937, Claude Shannon produced his master&#x27;s thesis at MIT that implemented Boolean algebra and binary arithmetic using electronic relays and switches for the first time in history. Entitled &quot;A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits&quot;, Shannon&#x27;s thesis essentially founded practical digital circuit design.

In November 1937, George Stibitz, then working at Bell Labs, completed a relay-based computer he dubbed the &quot;Model K&quot; (for &quot;Kitchen&quot;, where he had assembled it), which calculated using binary addition. Bell Labs authorized a full research program in late 1938 with Stibitz at the helm. Their Complex Number Computer, completed 8 January 1940, was able to calculate complex numbers. In a demonstration to the American Mathematical Society conference at Dartmouth College on 11 September 1940, Stibitz was able to send the Complex Number Calculator remote commands over telephone lines by a teletype. It was the first computing machine ever used remotely over a phone line. Some participants of the conference who witnessed the demonstration were John von Neumann, John Mauchly and Norbert Wiener, who wrote about it in his memoirs.

The Z1 computer, which was designed and built by Konrad Zuse between 1935 and 1938, used Boolean logic and binary floating-point numbers.

==Representation==
Any number can be represented by a sequence of bits (binary digits), which in turn may be represented by any mechanism capable of being in two mutually exclusive states. Any of the following rows of symbols can be interpreted as the binary numeric value of 667:

The numeric value represented in each case depends on the value assigned to each symbol. In the earlier days of computing, switches, punched holes, and punched paper tapes were used to represent binary values. In a modern computer, the numeric values may be represented by two different voltages; on a magnetic disk, magnetic polarities may be used. A &quot;positive&quot;, &quot;yes&quot;, or &quot;on&quot; state is not necessarily equivalent to the numerical value of one; it depends on the architecture in use.

In keeping with the customary representation of numerals using Arabic numerals, binary numbers are commonly written using the symbols 0 and 1. When written, binary numerals are often subscripted, prefixed, or suffixed to indicate their base, or radix. The following notations are equivalent:
* 100101 binary (explicit statement of format)
* 100101b (a suffix indicating binary format; also known as Intel convention)
* 100101B (a suffix indicating binary format)
* bin 100101 (a prefix indicating binary format)
* 1001012 (a subscript indicating base-2 (binary) notation)
* %100101 (a prefix indicating binary format; also known as Motorola convention)
* 0b100101 (a prefix indicating binary format, common in programming languages)
* 6b100101 (a prefix indicating number of bits in binary format, common in programming languages)
* #b100101 (a prefix indicating binary format, common in Lisp programming languages)

When spoken, binary numerals are usually read digit-by-digit, to distinguish them from decimal numerals. For example, the binary numeral 100 is pronounced &quot;one zero zero&quot;, rather than &quot;one hundred&quot;, to make its binary nature explicit and for purposes of correctness. Since the binary numeral 100 represents the value four, it would be confusing to refer to the numeral as &quot;one hundred&quot; (a word that represents a completely different value, or amount). Alternatively, the binary numeral 100 can be read out as &quot;four&quot; (the correct &quot;value&quot;), but this does not make its binary nature explicit.

==Counting in binary==
Counting in binary is similar to counting in any other number system. Beginning with a single digit, counting proceeds through each symbol, in increasing order. Before examining binary counting, it is useful to briefly discuss the more familiar decimal counting system as a frame of reference.

===Decimal counting===
Decimal counting uses the ten symbols &quot;0&quot; through &quot;9&quot;. Counting begins with the incremental substitution of the least significant digit (rightmost digit) which is often called the &quot;first digit&quot;. When the available symbols for this position are exhausted, the least significant digit is reset to &quot;0&quot;, and the next digit of higher significance (one position to the left) is incremented (&quot;overflow&quot;), and incremental substitution of the low-order digit resumes. This method of reset and overflow is repeated for each digit of significance. Counting progresses as follows:

:000, 001, 002, ... 007, 008, 009, (rightmost digit is reset to zero, and the digit to its left is incremented)
:010, 011, 012, ...
:090, 091, 092, ... 097, 098, 099, (rightmost two digits are reset to zeroes, and next digit is incremented)
:100, 101, 102, ...

===Binary counting===
Binary counting follows the exact same procedure, and again the incremental substitution begins with the least significant binary digit, or &quot;bit&quot; (the rightmost one, also called the &quot;first bit&quot;), except that only the two symbols &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot; are available. Thus, after a bit reaches 1 in binary, an increment resets it to 0 but also causes an increment of the next bit to the left:

:0000,
:0001, (rightmost bit starts over, and the next bit is incremented)
:0010, 0011, (rightmost two bits start over, and the next bit is incremented)
:0100, 0101, 0110, 0111, (rightmost three bits start over, and the next bit is incremented)
:1000, 1001, 1010, 1011, 1100, 1101, 1110, 1111 ...

In the binary system, each bit represents an increasing power of 2, with the rightmost bit representing 20, the next representing 21, then 22, and so on. The value of a binary number is the sum of the powers of 2 represented by each &quot;1&quot;‚ÄØbit. For example, the binary number 100101 is converted to decimal form as follows:

:1001012 = [ ( 1 ) √ó 25 ] + [ ( 0 ) √ó 24 ] + [ ( 0 ) √ó 23 ] + [ ( 1 ) √ó 22 ] + [ ( 0 ) √ó 21 ] + [ ( 1 ) √ó 20 ]

:1001012 = [ 1 √ó 32 ] + [ 0 √ó 16 ] + [ 0 √ó 8 ] + [ 1 √ó 4 ] + [ 0 √ó 2 ] + [ 1 √ó 1 ]

:1001012 = 3710

==Fractions==

Fractions in binary arithmetic terminate only if the denominator is a power of 2. As a result, 1/10 does not have a finite binary representation (10 has prime factors 2 and 5). This causes 10 √ó 1/10 not to precisely equal 1 in binary floating-point arithmetic. As an example, to interpret the binary expression for 1/3 = .010101..., this means: 1/3 = 0 √ó 2‚àí1 + 1 √ó 2‚àí2 + 0 √ó 2‚àí3 + 1 √ó 2‚àí4 + ... = 0.3125 + ... An exact value cannot be found with a sum of a finite number of inverse powers of two, the zeros and ones in the binary representation of 1/3 alternate forever.

==Binary arithmetic==
Arithmetic in binary is much like arithmetic in other positional notation numeral systems. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division can be performed on binary numerals.

===Addition===

The simplest arithmetic operation in binary is addition. Adding two single-digit binary numbers is relatively simple, using a form of carrying:

:0 + 0 ‚Üí 0
:0 + 1 ‚Üí 1
:1 + 0 ‚Üí 1
:1 + 1 ‚Üí 0, carry 1 (since 1 + 1 = 2 = 0 + (1 √ó 21) )
Adding two &quot;1&quot; digits produces a digit &quot;0&quot;, while 1 will have to be added to the next column. This is similar to what happens in decimal when certain single-digit numbers are added together; if the result equals or exceeds the value of the radix (10), the digit to the left is incremented:

:5 + 5 ‚Üí 0, carry 1 (since 5 + 5 = 10 = 0 + (1 √ó 101) )
:7 + 9 ‚Üí 6, carry 1 (since 7 + 9 = 16 = 6 + (1 √ó 101) )

This is known as &quot;carrying&quot;. When the result of an addition exceeds the value of a digit, the procedure is to &quot;carry&quot; the excess amount divided by the radix (that is, 10/10) to the left, adding it to the next positional value. This is correct since the next position has a weight that is higher by a factor equal to the radix. Carrying works the same way in binary:
 0 1 1 0 1
 + 1 0 1 1 1
 = 1 0 0 1 0 0 = 36

In this example, two numerals are being added together: 011012 (1310) and 101112 (2310). The top row shows the carry bits used. Starting in the rightmost column, 1 + 1 = 102. The 1 is carried to the left, and the 0 is written at the bottom of the rightmost column. The second column from the right is added: 1 + 0 + 1 = 102 again; the 1 is carried, and 0 is written at the bottom. The third column: 1 + 1 + 1 = 112. This time, a 1 is carried, and a 1 is written in the bottom row. Proceeding like this gives the final answer 1001002 (3610).

When computers must add two numbers, the rule that:
x xor y = (x + y) mod 2
for any two bits x and y allows for very fast calculation, as well.

====Long carry method====
A simplification for many binary addition problems is the &quot;long carry method&quot; or &quot;Brookhouse Method of Binary Addition&quot;. This method is particularly useful when one of the numbers contains a long stretch of ones. It is based on the simple premise that under the binary system, when given a stretch of digits composed entirely of ones (where is any integer length), adding 1 will result in the number 1 followed by a string of zeros. That concept follows, logically, just as in the decimal system, where adding 1 to a string of 9s will result in the number 1 followed by a string of 0s:

 Binary Decimal
 1 1 1 1 1 likewise 9 9 9 9 9
 + 1 + 1
 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0

Such long strings are quite common in the binary system. From that one finds that large binary numbers can be added using two simple steps, without excessive carry operations. In the following example, two numerals are being added together: 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 02 (95810) and 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 12 (69110), using the traditional carry method on the left, and the long carry method on the right:

 Traditional Carry Method Long Carry Method
 vs.
 carry the 1 until it is one digit past the &quot;string&quot; below
 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 cross out the &quot;string&quot;,
 + 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 + 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 and cross out the digit that was added to it
 = 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1

The top row shows the carry bits used. Instead of the standard carry from one column to the next, the lowest-ordered &quot;1&quot; with a &quot;1&quot; in the corresponding place value beneath it may be added and a &quot;1&quot; may be carried to one digit past the end of the series. The &quot;used&quot; numbers must be crossed off, since they are already added. Other long strings may likewise be cancelled using the same technique. Then, simply add together any remaining digits normally. Proceeding in this manner gives the final answer of 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 12 (164910). In our simple example using small numbers, the traditional carry method required eight carry operations, yet the long carry method required only two, representing a substantial reduction of effort.

====Addition table====

The binary addition table is similar to, but not the same as, the truth table of the logical disjunction operation formula_1. The difference is that formula_2, while formula_3.

=== Subtraction ===
Subtraction works in much the same way:

:0 ‚àí 0 ‚Üí 0
:0 ‚àí 1 ‚Üí 1, borrow 1
:1 ‚àí 0 ‚Üí 1
:1 ‚àí 1 ‚Üí 0
Subtracting a &quot;1&quot; digit from a &quot;0&quot; digit produces the digit &quot;1&quot;, while 1 will have to be subtracted from the next column. This is known as &quot;borrowing&quot;. The principle is the same as for carrying. When the result of a subtraction is less than 0, the least possible value of a digit, the procedure is to &quot;borrow&quot; the deficit divided by the radix (that is, 10/10) from the left, subtracting it from the next positional value.

 * * * * (starred columns are borrowed from)
 1 1 0 1 1 1 0
 ‚àí 1 0 1 1 1
 = 1 0 1 0 1 1 1

 * (starred columns are borrowed from)
 1 0 1 1 1 1 1
 ‚Äì 1 0 1 0 1 1
 = 0 1 1 0 1 0 0

Subtracting a positive number is equivalent to &quot;adding&quot; a negative number of equal absolute value. Computers use signed number representations to handle negative numbers‚Äîmost commonly the two&#x27;s complement notation. Such representations eliminate the need for a separate &quot;subtract&quot; operation. Using two&#x27;s complement notation, subtraction can be summarized by the following formula:

===Multiplication===
Multiplication in binary is similar to its decimal counterpart. Two numbers and can be multiplied by partial products: for each digit in , the product of that digit in is calculated and written on a new line, shifted leftward so that its rightmost digit lines up with the digit in that was used. The sum of all these partial products gives the final result.

Since there are only two digits in binary, there are only two possible outcomes of each partial multiplication:
* If the digit in is 0, the partial product is also 0
* If the digit in is 1, the partial product is equal to 

For example, the binary numbers 1011 and 1010 are multiplied as follows:

 1 0 1 1 ()
 √ó 1 0 1 0 ()
 0 0 0 0 ‚Üê to the rightmost &#x27;zero&#x27; in 
 + 1 0 1 1 ‚Üê to the next &#x27;one&#x27; in 
 + 0 0 0 0
 + 1 0 1 1
 = 1 1 0 1 1 1 0

Binary numbers can also be multiplied with bits after a binary point:

 1 0 1 . 1 0 1 (5.625 in decimal)
 √ó 1 1 0 . 0 1 (6.25 in decimal)
 1 . 0 1 1 0 1 ‚Üê to a &#x27;one&#x27; in 
 + 0 0 . 0 0 0 0 ‚Üê to a &#x27;zero&#x27; in 
 + 0 0 0 . 0 0 0
 + 1 0 1 1 . 0 1
 + 1 0 1 1 0 . 1
 = 1 0 0 0 1 1 . 0 0 1 0 1 (35.15625 in decimal)

See also Booth&#x27;s multiplication algorithm.

====Multiplication table====
The binary multiplication table is the same as the truth table of the logical conjunction operation formula_4.

===Division===
Long division in binary is again similar to its decimal counterpart.

In the example below, the divisor is 1012, or 5 in decimal, while the dividend is 110112, or 27 in decimal. The procedure is the same as that of decimal long division; here, the divisor 1012 goes into the first three digits 1102 of the dividend one time, so a &quot;1&quot; is written on the top line. This result is multiplied by the divisor, and subtracted from the first three digits of the dividend; the next digit (a &quot;1&quot;) is included to obtain a new three-digit sequence:

 1
 ___________
 1 0 1 ) 1 1 0 1 1
 ‚àí 1 0 1
 0 0 1

The procedure is then repeated with the new sequence, continuing until the digits in the dividend have been exhausted:

 1 0 1
 ___________
 1 0 1 ) 1 1 0 1 1
 ‚àí 1 0 1
 1 1 1
 ‚àí 1 0 1
 0 1 0

Thus, the quotient of 110112 divided by 1012 is 1012, as shown on the top line, while the remainder, shown on the bottom line, is 102. In decimal, this corresponds to the fact that 27 divided by 5 is 5, with a remainder of 2.

Aside from long division, one can also devise the procedure so as to allow for over-subtracting from the partial remainder at each iteration, thereby leading to alternative methods which are less systematic, but more flexible as a result.

===Square root===
The process of taking a binary square root digit by digit is essentially the same as for a decimal square root but much simpler, due to the binary nature. First group the digits in pairs, using a leading 0 if necessary so there are an even number of digits. Now at each step, consider the answer so far, extended with the digits 01. If this can be subtracted from the current remainder, do so. Then extend the remainder with the next pair of digits. If you subtracted, the next digit of the answer is 1, otherwise it&#x27;s 0.

 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1
 ‚àö 10 10 10 01 ‚àö 10 10 10 01 ‚àö 10 10 10 01 ‚àö 10 10 10 01 ‚àö 10 10 10 01
 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 
 Answer so far is 0, ---- ---- ---- ---- 
 extended by 01 is 001, 1 10 1 10 1 10 1 10
 this CAN be subtracted - 1 01 - 1 01 - 1 01
 from first pair 10, Answer so far is 1, ------- ------- -------
 so first digit of extended by 01 is 101, 1 10 1 10 01 1 10 01
 answer is 1. this CAN be subtracted - 1 10 01
 from remainder 110, so Answer so far is 11, Answer so far is 110, ----------
 next answer digit is 1. extended by 01 is 1101, extended by 01 is 11001, 0
 this is TOO BIG to this CAN be subtracted
 subtract from remainder from remainder 11001, so Done!
 110, so next digit of next digit of answer is 1.
 answer is 0.

==Bitwise operations==

Though not directly related to the numerical interpretation of binary symbols, sequences of bits may be manipulated using Boolean logical operators. When a string of binary symbols is manipulated in this way, it is called a bitwise operation; the logical operators AND, OR, and XOR may be performed on corresponding bits in two binary numerals provided as input. The logical NOT operation may be performed on individual bits in a single binary numeral provided as input. Sometimes, such operations may be used as arithmetic short-cuts, and may have other computational benefits as well. For example, an arithmetic shift left of a binary number is the equivalent of multiplication by a (positive, integral) power of 2.

==Conversion to and from other numeral systems==

===Decimal to binary===

To convert from a base-10 integer to its base-2 (binary) equivalent, the number is divided by two. The remainder is the least-significant bit. The quotient is again divided by two; its remainder becomes the next least significant bit. This process repeats until a quotient of one is reached. The sequence of remainders (including the final quotient of one) forms the binary value, as each remainder must be either zero or one when dividing by two. For example, (357)10 is expressed as (101100101)2.

=== Binary to decimal ===
Conversion from base-2 to base-10 simply inverts the preceding algorithm. The bits of the binary number are used one by one, starting with the most significant (leftmost) bit. Beginning with the value 0, the prior value is doubled, and the next bit is then added to produce the next value. This can be organized in a multi-column table. For example, to convert 100101011012 to decimal:

The result is 119710. The first Prior Value of 0 is simply an initial decimal value. This method is an application of the Horner scheme.

The fractional parts of a number are converted with similar methods. They are again based on the equivalence of shifting with doubling or halving.

In a fractional binary number such as 0.110101101012, the first digit is formula_5, the second formula_6, etc. So if there is a 1 in the first place after the decimal, then the number is at least formula_7, and vice versa. Double that number is at least 1. This suggests the algorithm: Repeatedly double the number to be converted, record if the result is at least 1, and then throw away the integer part.

For example, formula_8, in binary, is:

Thus the repeating decimal fraction 0... is equivalent to the repeating binary fraction 0... .

Or for example, 0.110, in binary, is:

This is also a repeating binary fraction 0.0... . It may come as a surprise that terminating decimal fractions can have repeating expansions in binary. It is for this reason that many are surprised to discover that 1/10 + ... + 1/10 (addition of 10 numbers) differs from 1 in binary floating point arithmetic. In fact, the only binary fractions with terminating expansions are of the form of an integer divided by a power of 2, which 1/10 is not.

The final conversion is from binary to decimal fractions. The only difficulty arises with repeating fractions, but otherwise the method is to shift the fraction to an integer, convert it as above, and then divide by the appropriate power of two in the decimal base. For example:

formula_9

Another way of converting from binary to decimal, often quicker for a person familiar with hexadecimal, is to do so indirectly‚Äîfirst converting (formula_10 in binary) into (formula_10 in hexadecimal) and then converting (formula_10 in hexadecimal) into (formula_10 in decimal).

For very large numbers, these simple methods are inefficient because they perform a large number of multiplications or divisions where one operand is very large. A simple divide-and-conquer algorithm is more effective asymptotically: given a binary number, it is divided by 10&quot;k&quot;, where &quot;k&quot; is chosen so that the quotient roughly equals the remainder; then each of these pieces is converted to decimal and the two are concatenated. Given a decimal number, it can be split into two pieces of about the same size, each of which is converted to binary, whereupon the first converted piece is multiplied by 10&quot;k&quot; and added to the second converted piece, where &quot;k&quot; is the number of decimal digits in the second, least-significant piece before conversion.

===Hexadecimal===
Binary may be converted to and from hexadecimal more easily. This is because the radix of the hexadecimal system (16) is a power of the radix of the binary system (2). More specifically, 16 = 24, so it takes four digits of binary to represent one digit of hexadecimal, as shown in the adjacent table.

To convert a hexadecimal number into its binary equivalent, simply substitute the corresponding binary digits:

:3A16 = 0011 10102
:E716 = 1110 01112

To convert a binary number into its hexadecimal equivalent, divide it into groups of four bits. If the number of bits isn&#x27;t a multiple of four, simply insert extra 0 bits at the left (called padding). For example:

:10100102 = 0101 0010 grouped with padding = 5216
:110111012 = 1101 1101 grouped = DD16

To convert a hexadecimal number into its decimal equivalent, multiply the decimal equivalent of each hexadecimal digit by the corresponding power of 16 and add the resulting values:

:C0E716 = (12 √ó 163) + (0 √ó 162) + (14 √ó 161) + (7 √ó 160) = (12 √ó 4096) + (0 √ó 256) + (14 √ó 16) + (7 √ó 1) = 49,38310

===Octal===

Binary is also easily converted to the octal numeral system, since octal uses a radix of 8, which is a power of two (namely, 23, so it takes exactly three binary digits to represent an octal digit). The correspondence between octal and binary numerals is the same as for the first eight digits of hexadecimal in the table above. Binary 000 is equivalent to the octal digit 0, binary 111 is equivalent to octal 7, and so forth.

Converting from octal to binary proceeds in the same fashion as it does for hexadecimal:

:658 = 110 1012
:178 = 001 1112

And from binary to octal:

:1011002 = 101 1002 grouped = 548
:100112 = 010 0112 grouped with padding = 238

And from octal to decimal:

:658 = (6 √ó 81) + (5 √ó 80) = (6 √ó 8) + (5 √ó 1) = 5310
:1278 = (1 √ó 82) + (2 √ó 81) + (7 √ó 80) = (1 √ó 64) + (2 √ó 8) + (7 √ó 1) = 8710

==Representing real numbers==

Non-integers can be represented by using negative powers, which are set off from the other digits by means of a radix point (called a decimal point in the decimal system). For example, the binary number 11.012 means:

For a total of 3.25 decimal.

All dyadic rational numbers formula_14 have a &quot;terminating&quot; binary numeral‚Äîthe binary representation has a finite number of terms after the radix point. Other rational numbers have binary representation, but instead of terminating, they &quot;recur&quot;, with a finite sequence of digits repeating indefinitely. For instance

formula_15
formula_16

The phenomenon that the binary representation of any rational is either terminating or recurring also occurs in other radix-based numeral systems. See, for instance, the explanation in decimal. Another similarity is the existence of alternative representations for any terminating representation, relying on the fact that 0.111111... is the sum of the geometric series 2‚àí1 + 2‚àí2 + 2‚àí3 + ... which is 1.

Binary numerals that neither terminate nor recur represent irrational numbers. For instance,
* 0.10100100010000100000100... does have a pattern, but it is not a fixed-length recurring pattern, so the number is irrational
* 1.0110101000001001111001100110011111110... is the binary representation of formula_17, the square root of 2, another irrational. It has no discernible pattern.

<text>Fibrinogen (coagulation factor I) is a glycoprotein complex, produced in the liver, that circulates in the blood of all vertebrates. During tissue and vascular injury, it is converted enzymatically by thrombin to fibrin and then to a fibrin-based blood clot. Fibrin clots function primarily to occlude blood vessels to stop bleeding. Fibrin also binds and reduces the activity of thrombin. This activity, sometimes referred to as antithrombin I, limits clotting. Fibrin also mediates blood platelet and endothelial cell spreading, tissue fibroblast proliferation, capillary tube formation, and angiogenesis and thereby promotes revascularization and wound healing.

Reduced and/or dysfunctional fibrinogens occur in various congenital and acquired human fibrinogen-related disorders. These disorders represent a group of rare conditions in which individuals may present with severe episodes of pathological bleeding and thrombosis; these conditions are treated by supplementing blood fibrinogen levels and inhibiting blood clotting, respectively. These disorders may also be the cause of certain liver and kidney diseases.

Fibrinogen is a &quot;positive&quot; acute-phase protein, i.e. its blood levels rise in response to systemic inflammation, tissue injury, and certain other events. It is also elevated in various cancers. Elevated levels of fibrinogen in inflammation as well as cancer and other conditions have been suggested to be the cause of thrombosis and vascular injury that accompanies these conditions.

== Genes ==
Fibrinogen is made and secreted into the blood primarily by liver hepatocyte cells. Endothelium cells are also reported to make small amounts of fibrinogen, but this fibrinogen has not been fully characterized; blood platelets and their precursors, bone marrow megakaryocytes, while once thought to make fibrinogen, are now known to take up and store but not make the glycoprotein. The final secreted, hepatocyte-derived glycoprotein is composed of two trimers, with each trimer composed of three different polypeptide chains, the fibrinogen alpha chain (also termed the AŒ± or Œ± chain) encoded by the &quot;FGA&quot; gene, the fibrinogen beta chain (also termed the BŒ≤ or Œ≤ chain) encoded by the &quot;FGB&quot; gene, and the fibrinogen gamma chain (also termed the Œ≥ chain) encoded by the &quot;FGG&quot; gene. All three genes are located on the long or &quot;q&quot; arm of human chromosome 4 (at positions 4q31.3, 4q31.3, and 4q32.1, respectively).

Alternate splicing of the &quot;FGA&quot; gene produces a minor expanded isoform of AŒ± termed AŒ±E which replaces AŒ± in 1‚Äì3% of circulating fibrinogen; alternate splicing of &quot;FGG&quot; produces a minor isoform of Œ≥ termed Œ≥&#x27; which replaces Œ≥ in 8‚Äì10% of circulating fibrinogen; &quot;FGB&quot; is not alternatively spliced. Hence, the final fibrinogen product is composed principally of AŒ±, BŒ≤, and Œ≥ chains with a small percentage of it containing AŒ±E and/or Œ≥&#x27; chains in place of AŒ± and/or Œ≥ chains, respectively. The three genes are transcribed and translated in co-ordination by a mechanism(s) which remains incompletely understood. The coordinated transcription of these three fibrinogen genes is rapidly and greatly increased by systemic conditions such as inflammation and tissue injury. Cytokines produced during these systemic conditions, such as interleukin 6 and interleukin 1Œ≤, appear responsible for up-regulating this transcription.

== Structure ==


The AŒ±, BŒ≤, and Œ≥ chains are transcribed and translated coordinately on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), with their peptide chains being passed into the ER while their signal peptide portions are removed. Inside the ER, the three chains are assembled initially into AŒ±Œ≥ and BŒ≤Œ≥ dimers, then to AŒ±BŒ≤Œ≥ trimers, and finally to (AŒ±BŒ≤Œ≥)2 heximers, i.e. two AŒ±BŒ≤Œ≥ trimers joined by numerous disulfide bonds. The heximer is transferred to the Golgi where it is glycosylated, hydroxylated, sulfated, and phosphorylated to form the mature fibrinogen glycoprotein that is secreted into the blood. Mature fibrinogen is arranged as a long flexible protein array of three nodules held together by a very thin thread which is estimated to have a diameter between 8 and 15¬†angstroms (√Ö). The two end nodules (termed D regions or domains) are alike in consisting of BŒ≤ and Œ≥ chains, while the center slightly smaller nodule (termed the E region or domain) consists of two intertwined AŒ± alpha chains. Measurements of shadow lengths indicate that nodule diameters are in the range 50 to 70¬†√Ö. The length of the dried molecule is 475 ¬± 25¬†√Ö.

The fibrinogen molecule circulates as a soluble plasma glycoprotein with a typical molecular weight of ~340 ‚Äì ~420¬†kDa (kilodaltons) (depending on its content of AŒ± verses AŒ±E, Œ≥ versus Œ≥&#x27; chains, and carbohydrate [~4 ‚Äì ~10%w/w]). It has a rod-like shape with dimensions of 9 √ó 47.5 √ó 6¬†nm and has a negative net charge at physiological pH (its isoelectric point ~5.5 ‚Äì ~6.5, e.g. pH 5.8). The normal concentration of fibrinogen in blood plasma is 150‚Äì400¬†mg/dl, with levels appreciably below or above this range associated with pathological bleeding and/or thrombosis. Fibrinogen has a circulating half-life of ~4 days.

== Blood clot formation ==

During blood clotting, thrombin attacks the N-terminus of the AŒ± and BŒ≤ chains in fibrinogen to form individual fibrin strands plus two small polypeptides, fibrinopeptides A and B derived from these respective chains. The individual fibrin strands then polymerize and are crosslinked with other fibrin strands by blood factor XIIIa to form an extensive interconnected fibrin network that is the basis for the formation of a mature fibrin clot. In addition to forming fibrin, fibrinogen also promotes blood clotting by forming bridges between, and activating, blood platelets through binding to their GpIIb/IIIa surface membrane fibrinogen receptor.

Fibrin participates in limiting blood clot formation and degrading formed blood clots by at least two important mechanisms. First, it possesses three low affinity binding sites (two in fibrin&#x27;s E domain; one in its D domain) for thrombin; this binding sequesters thrombin from attacking fibrinogen. Second, fibrin&#x27;s AŒ± chain accelerates by at least 100-fold the amount of plasmin activated by tissue plasminogen activator; plasmin breaks-down blood clots. Plasmin&#x27;s attack on fibrin releases D-dimers (also termed DD dimers). The detection of these dimers in blood is used as a clinical test for fibrinolysis.

== Fibrinogen disorders ==
Several disorders in the quantity and/or quality of fibrinogen cause pathological bleeding, pathological blood clotting, and/or the deposition of fibrinogen in the liver, kidneys, and other tissues.

=== Congenital afibrinogenemia ===

Congenital afibrinogenemia is a rare and generally autosomal recessive inherited disorder in which blood does not clot due to a lack of fibrinogen (plasma fibrinogen levels typically) but sometimes detected at extremely low levels, e.g. &lt;10¬†mg/dl. This severe disorder is usually caused by mutations in both the maternal and paternal copies of either the &quot;FGA, FGB,&quot; or &quot;FBG&quot; gene. The mutations have virtually complete genetic penetrance with essentially all homozygous bearers experiencing frequent and sometimes life-threatening episodes of bleeding and/or thrombosis. Pathological bleeding occurs early in life, for example often being seen at birth with excessive hemorrhage from the navel.

=== Congenital hypofibrinogenemia ===
Congenital hypofibrinogenemia is a rare inherited disorder in which blood may not clot normally due to reduced levels of fibrinogen (plasma fibrinogen typically &lt;150 but &gt;50¬†mg/dl). The disorder reflects a disruptive mutation in only one of the two parental &quot;FGA, FGB,&quot; or &quot;FBG&quot; genes and has a low degree of genetic penetrance, i.e. only some family members with the defective gene ever exhibit symptoms. Symptoms of the disorder, which more often occurs in individuals with lower plasma fibrinogen levels, include episodic bleeding and thrombosis that typically begin in late childhood or adulthood.

=== Fibrinogen storage disease ===
Fibringogen storage disease is an extremely rare disorder. It is a form of congenital hypofibrinogenemia in which certain specific hereditary mutations in one copy of the &quot;FGG&quot; gene causes its fibrinogen product to accumulate in, and damage, liver cells. The disorder has not reported with &quot;FGA&quot; or &quot;FGB&quot; mutations. Symptoms of these &quot;FGG&quot; mutations have a low level of penetrance. The plasma fibrinogen levels (generally &lt;150 but &gt;50¬†mg/dl) detected in this disorder reflect the fibrinogen made by the normal gene. Fibrinogen storage disease may lead to abnormal bleeding and thrombosis but is distinguished by also sometimes leading to liver cirrhosis.

=== Congenital dysfibrinogenemia ===
Congenital dysfibrinogenemia is a rare autosomal dominant inherited disorder in which plasma fibrinogen is composed of a dysfunctional fibrinogen made by a mutated &quot;FGA, FGB,&quot; or &quot;FBG&quot; gene inherited from one parent plus a normal fibrinogen made by a normal gene inherited from the other parent. As a reflection of this duality, plasma fibrinogen levels measured by immunological methods are normal (&gt;150¬†mg/dl) but are c. 50% lower when measured by clot formation methods. The disorder exhibits reduced penetrance, with only some individuals with the abnormal gene showing symptoms of abnormal bleeding and thrombosis.

=== Hereditary fibrinogen AŒ±-Chain amyloidosis ===
Hereditary fibrinogen AŒ±-Chain amyloidosis is an autosomal dominant extremely rare inherited disorder caused by a mutation in one of the two copies of the &quot;FGA&quot; gene. It is a form of congenital dysfibrinogenemia in which certain mutations lead to the production of an abnormal fibrinogen that circulates in the blood while gradually accumulating in the kidney. This accumulation leads over time to one form of familial renal amyloidosis. Plasma fibrinogen levels are similar to that seen in other forms of congenital dysfibrinogenemia. Fibrinogen AŒ±-Chain amyloidosis has not associated with abnormal bleeding or thrombosis.

=== Acquired dysfibrinogenemia ===
Acquired dysfibrinogenemia is a rare disorder in which circulating fibrinogen is composed at least in part of a dysfunctional fibrinogen due to various acquired diseases. One well-studied cause of the disorder is severe liver disease including hepatoma, chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis, and jaundice due to biliary tract obstruction. The diseased liver synthesizes a fibrinogen which has a normally functional amino acid sequence but is incorrectly glycosylated (i.e. has a wrong amount of sugar residues) added to it during its passage through the Golgi. The incorrectly glycosalated fibrinogen is dysfunctional and may cause pathological episodes of bleeding and/or blood clotting. Other, less well understood, causes are plasma cell dyscrasias and autoimmune disorders in which a circulating abnormal immunoglobulin or other protein interferes with fibrinogen function, and rare cases of cancer and medication (isotretinoin, glucocorticoids, and antileukemic drugs) toxicities.

=== Congenital hypodysfibrinogenemia ===
Congenital hypodysfibrinogenemia is a rare inherited disorder in which low levels (i.e. &lt;150¬†mg/dl) of immunologically detected plasma fibrinogen are composed at least in part of a dysfunctional fibrinogen. The disorder reflects mutations typically in both inherited fibrinogen genes, one of which produces a dysfunctional fibrinogen, while the other produces low amounts of fibrinogen. The disorder, while having reduced penetrance, is usually more severe than congenital dysfibrinogenemia, but like the latter disorder, causes pathological episodes of bleeding and/or blood clotting.

=== Cryofibrinogenemia ===
Cryofibrinogenemia is an acquired disorder in which fibrinogen precipitates at cold temperatures and may lead to the intravascular precipitation of fibrinogen, fibrin, and other circulating proteins, thereby causing the infarction of various tissues and bodily extremities. Cryoglobulonemia may occur without evidence of an underlying associated disorders, i.e. primary cryoglobulinemia (also termed essential cryoglobulinemia) or, far more commonly, with evidence of an underlying disease, i.e. secondary cryoglobulonemia. Secondary cryofibrinoenemia can develop in individuals with infection (% of cases), malignant or premalignant disorders (21%), vasculitis (25%), and autoimmune diseases (42%). In these cases, cryofibinogenema may or may not cause tissue injury and/or other symptoms and the actual cause-effect relationship between these diseases and the development of cryofibrinogenmia is unclear. Cryofibrinogenemia can also occur in association with the intake of certain drugs.

=== Acquired hypofibrinogenemia ===
Acquired hypofibrinogenemia is a deficiency in circulating fibrinogen due to excessive consumption that may occur as a result of trauma, certain phases of disseminated intravascular coagulation, and sepsis. It may also occur as a result of hemodilution as a result of blood losses and/or transfusions with packed red blood cells or other fibrinogen-poor whole blood replacements.

== Laboratory tests ==
Clinical analyses of the fibrinogen disorders typically measure blood clotting using the following successive steps: Higher levels are, amongst others, associated with cardiovascular disease (&gt;3.43¬†g/L). It may be elevated in any form of inflammation, as it is an acute-phase protein; for example, it is especially apparent in human gingival tissue during the initial phase of periodontal disease.
*Blood clotting is measured using standard tests, e.g. prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, thrombin time, and/or reptilase time. Low fibrinogen levels and dysfunctional fibrinogens usually prolong these times, whereas the lack of fibrinogen (i.e. afibrinogenemia) renders these times infinitely prolonged.
*Fibrinogen levels are measured in the plasma isolated from venous blood by immunoassays, or through clotting assays such as the Clauss fibrinogen assay or prothrombin based methods. Normal levels being about 1.5-3¬†g/L, depending on the method used. These levels are normal in dysfibrinogenemia (i.e. 1.5-3¬†g/L), decreased in hypofibrinogenemia and hypodysfibrinogenemia (i.e. &lt;1.5¬†g/L), and absent (i.e. &lt;0.02¬†g/L) in afibrinogenemia.
*Functional levels of fibrinogen are measured on plasma induced to clot. The levels of clotted fibrinogen in this test should be decreased in hypofibrinogenemia, hypodysfibrinogenemia, and dysfibrinogenemia and undetectable in afibrinogenemia. 
*Functional fibrinogen/antigenic fibrinogen levels are &lt;0.7¬†g/L in hypofibrinogenemia, hypodysfibrinogenemia, and dysfibrogenemia, and not applicable in afibrinogenemia.
*Fibrinogen analysis can also be tested on whole-blood samples by thromboelastometry. This analysis investigates the interaction of coagulation factors, their inhibitors, anticoagulant drugs, and blood cells (specifically, platelets), during clotting and subsequent fibrinolysis as it occurs in whole blood. The test provides information on hemostatic efficacy and maximum clot firmness to give additional information on fibrin-platelet interactions and the rate of fibrinolysis (see Thromboelastometry).
*Scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy of in vitro-formed clots can give information on fibrin clot density and architecture.
*The fibrinogen uptake test or fibrinogen scan was formerly used to detect deep vein thrombosis. In this method, radioactively labeled fibrinogen, typically with radioiodine, is given to individuals, incorporated into a thrombus, and detected by scintigraphy.

== Hyperfibrinogenemia ==
Levels of functionally normal fibrinogen increase in pregnancy to an average of 4.5 gram/liter (g/L) compared to an average of 3¬†g/L in non-pregnant people. They may also increase in various forms of cancer, particularly gastric, lung, prostate, and ovarian cancers. In these cases, the &quot;hyperfibrinogenemia&quot; may contribute to the development of pathological thrombosis. A particular pattern of migratory superficial vein thrombosis, termed trousseau&#x27;s syndrome, occurs in, and may precede all other signs and symptoms of, these cancers. Hyperfibrinogenemia has also been linked as a cause of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn and post-operative thrombosis. High fibrinogen levels had been proposed as a predictor of hemorrhagic complications during catheter-directed thrombolysis for acute or subacute peripheral native artery and arterial bypass occlusions. However, a systematic review of the available literature until January 2016 found that the predictive value of plasma fibrinogen level for predicting hemorrhagic complications after catheter-directed thrombolysis is unproven.

<text>The Meselson‚ÄìStahl experiment is an experiment by Matthew Meselson and Franklin Stahl in 1958 which supported Watson and Crick&#x27;s hypothesis that DNA replication was semiconservative. In semiconservative replication, when the double-stranded DNA helix is replicated, each of the two new double-stranded DNA helices consisted of one strand from the original helix and one newly synthesized. It has been called &quot;the most beautiful experiment in biology&quot;. Meselson and Stahl decided the best way to trace the parent DNA would be to tag them by changing one of its atoms. Since nitrogen is present in all of the DNA bases, they generated parent DNA containing a heavier isotope of nitrogen than would be present naturally. This altered mass allowed them to determine how much of the parent DNA was present in the DNA after successive cycles of replication.

== Hypothesis ==

Three hypotheses had been previously proposed for the method of replication of DNA.

In the &quot;semiconservative&quot; hypothesis, proposed by Watson and Crick, the two strands of a DNA molecule separate during replication. Each strand then acts as a template for synthesis of a new strand.

The &quot;conservative&quot; hypothesis proposed that the entire DNA molecule acted as a template for the synthesis of an entirely new one. According to this model, histone proteins bind to the DNA, revolving the strand and exposing the nucleotide bases (which normally line the interior) for hydrogen bonding.

The &quot;dispersive&quot; hypothesis is exemplified by a model proposed by Max Delbr√ºck, which attempts to solve the problem of unwinding the two strands of the double helix by a mechanism that breaks the DNA backbone every 10 nucleotides or so, untwists the molecule, and attaches the old strand to the end of the newly synthesized one. This would synthesize the DNA in short pieces alternating from one strand to the other.

Each of these three models makes a different prediction about the distribution of the &quot;old&quot; DNA in molecules formed after replication. In the conservative hypothesis, after replication, one molecule is the entirely conserved &quot;old&quot; molecule, and the other is all newly synthesized DNA. The semiconservative hypothesis predicts that each molecule after replication will contain one old and one new strand. The dispersive model predicts that each strand of each new molecule will contain a mixture of old and new DNA.

== Experimental procedure and results ==

Nitrogen is a major constituent of DNA. 14N is by far the most abundant isotope of nitrogen, but DNA with the heavier (but non-radioactive) 15N isotope is also functional.

&quot;E. coli&quot; was grown for several generations in a medium containing NH4Cl with 15N. When DNA is extracted from these cells and made to undergo buoyant density centrifugation on a salt (CsCl) density gradient, the DNA separates out at the point at which its density equals that of the salt solution. The DNA of the cells grown in 15N medium had a higher density than cells grown in normal 14N medium. After that, &quot;E. coli&quot; cells with only 15N in their DNA were transferred to a 14N medium and were allowed to divide; the progress of cell division was monitored by microscopic cell counts and by colony assay.

DNA was extracted periodically and was compared to pure 14N DNA and 15N DNA. After one replication, the DNA was found to have intermediate density. Since conservative replication would result in equal amounts of DNA of the higher and lower densities (but no DNA of an intermediate density), conservative replication was excluded. However, this result was consistent with both semiconservative and dispersive replication. Semiconservative replication would result in double-stranded DNA with one strand of 15N DNA, and one of 14N DNA, while dispersive replication would result in double-stranded DNA with both strands having mixtures of 15N and 14N DNA, either of which would have appeared as DNA of an intermediate density.

The authors continued to sample cells as replication continued. DNA from cells after two replications had been completed was found to consist of equal amounts of DNA with two different densities, one corresponding to the intermediate density of DNA of cells grown for only one division in 14N medium, the other corresponding to DNA from cells grown exclusively in 14N medium. This was inconsistent with dispersive replication, which would have resulted in a single density, lower than the intermediate density of the one-generation cells, but still higher than cells grown only in 14N DNA medium, as the original 15N DNA would have been split evenly among all DNA strands. The result was consistent with the semiconservative replication hypothesis.

<doc id="238691" wikidata="Q422025" url="?curid=238691" title="Haptoglobin">
<text>Haptoglobin (abbreviated as Hp) is the protein that in humans is encoded by the &quot;HP&quot; gene. In blood plasma, haptoglobin binds with high affinity to &quot;free&quot; hemoglobin released from erythrocytes, and thereby inhibits its deleterious oxidative activity. Compared to Hp, hemopexin binds to &quot;free&quot; heme. The haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex will then be removed by the reticuloendothelial system (mostly the spleen).

In clinical settings, the haptoglobin assay is used to screen for and monitor intravascular hemolytic anemia. In intravascular hemolysis, free hemoglobin will be released into circulation and hence haptoglobin will bind the hemoglobin. This causes a decline in haptoglobin levels.

The protein was discovered as a &quot;plasma substance&quot; in 1938 by French biochemists Max-Fernand Jayle and Michel Polonovski.

== Function ==
Hemoglobin that has been released into the blood plasma by damaged red blood cells has harmful effects. The &quot;HP&quot; gene encodes a preproprotein that is processed to yield both alpha and beta chains, which subsequently combines as a tetramer to produce haptoglobin. Haptoglobin functions to bind the free plasma hemoglobin, which allows degradative enzymes to gain access to the hemoglobin while at the same time preventing loss of iron through the kidneys and protecting the kidneys from damage by hemoglobin. 

The cellular receptor target of Hp is the monocyte/macrophage scavenger receptor, CD163. Following Hb-Hp binding to CD163, cellular internalization of the complex leads to globin and heme metabolism, which is followed by adaptive changes in antioxidant and iron metabolism pathways and macrophage phenotype polarization.

Hp has hemoglobin-independent immunomodulatory functions. It dampens lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokine expression. Lipopolysaccharides directly bind to Hp, which, due to the high abundance of Hp in serum, results in their buffering and shielding from toll-like receptor 4. Functionally, this results in delayed activation of the NF-Œ∫B pathway.
===Difference from hemopexin===

When hemoglobin is released from RBCs within the physiologic range of haptoglobin, the potential deleterious effects of hemoglobin are prevented. During hyper-hemolytic conditions or with chronic hemolysis, haptoglobin is depleted and hemoglobin readily distributes to tissues where it might be exposed to oxidative conditions. In such conditions, heme can be released from ferric (Fe3+-bound) hemoglobin. The free heme can then accelerate tissue damage by promoting peroxidative reactions and activation of inflammatory cascades. Hemopexin (Hx) is another plasma glycoprotein that is able to bind heme with high affinity. It sequesters heme in an inert non-toxic form and transports it to the liver for catabolism and excretion.

== Synthesis ==
Haptoglobin is produced mostly by hepatic cells but also by other tissues such as skin, lung and kidney. In addition, the haptoglobin gene is expressed in murine and human adipose tissue.

Haptoglobin had been shown to be expressed in adipose tissue of cattle as well.

== Structure ==
Haptoglobin, in its simplest form, consists of two alpha and two beta chains, connected by disulfide bridges. The chains originate from a common precursor protein, which is proteolytically cleaved during protein synthesis.

Hp exists in two allelic forms in the human population, so-called &quot;Hp1&quot; and &quot;Hp2&quot;, the latter one having arisen due to the partial duplication of &quot;Hp1&quot; gene. Three genotypes of Hp, therefore, are found in humans: Hp1-1, Hp2-1, and Hp2-2. Hp of different genotypes have been shown to bind hemoglobin with different affinities, with Hp2-2 being the weakest binder. Allele 2 encodes for two multimerization domains. This results in oligomer formation in carriers of allele 2. The frequency of the short allele varies between 7% and 70% depending on racial origin. It is unclear which evolutionary advantage is conferred by the longer allele; strikingly, a similar partial duplication independently arose much earlier in a precursor of ruminants. Ruminants exclusively express oligomeric haptoglobin.

==In other species==
Hp has been found in all mammals studied so far, some birds, e.g., cormorant and ostrich but also, in its simpler form, in bony fish, e.g., zebrafish. Hp is absent in at least some amphibians (&quot;Xenopus&quot;) and neognathous birds (chicken and goose).

== Clinical significance ==
Mutations in this gene or its regulatory regions cause ahaptoglobinemia or hypohaptoglobinemia. This gene has also been linked to diabetic nephropathy, the incidence of coronary artery disease in type 1 diabetes, Crohn&#x27;s disease, inflammatory disease behavior, primary sclerosing cholangitis, susceptibility to idiopathic Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and a reduced incidence of &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot; malaria.

Since the reticuloendothelial system will remove the haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex from the body, haptoglobin levels will be decreased in case of intravascular hemolysis or &quot;severe&quot; extravascular hemolysis. In the process of binding to free hemoglobin, haptoglobin sequesters the iron within hemoglobin, preventing iron-utilizing bacteria from benefiting from hemolysis. It is theorized that, because of this, haptoglobin has evolved into an acute-phase protein. HP has a protective influence on the hemolytic kidney.

The different haptoglobin phenotypes differ in their antioxidant, scavenging, and immunomodulatory properties. This aspect of haptoglobin may gain importance in immune suppressed conditions (such as liver cirrhosis) and the various phenotypes may result in different susceptibility levels towards bacterial infections.

Some studies associate certain haptoglobin phenotypes with the risk of developing hypertension in diabetes and schizophrenia.

=== Test protocol ===
Measuring the level of haptoglobin in a patient&#x27;s blood is ordered whenever a patient exhibits symptoms of anemia, such as pallor, fatigue, or shortness of breath, along with physical signs of hemolysis, such as jaundice or dark-colored urine. The test is also commonly ordered as a hemolytic anemia battery, which also includes a reticulocyte count and a peripheral blood smear. It can also be ordered along with a direct antiglobulin test when a patient is suspected of having a transfusion reaction or symptoms of autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Also, it may be ordered in conjunction with a bilirubin.

=== Interpretation ===
A decrease in haptoglobin can support a diagnosis of hemolysis, especially when correlated with a decreased hemoglobin, and hematocrit, and also an increased reticulocyte count. Low haptoglobin levels occur regardless of the site and mechanism of haemolysis (intravascular and splenic/&quot;extravascular&quot;) 

If the reticulocyte count is increased, but the haptoglobin level is normal, this argues against haemolysis, and suggests a bone marrow response to blood loss. If there are symptoms of anemia but both the reticulocyte count and the haptoglobin level are normal, the anemia is most likely not due to hemolysis. Haptoglobin levels that are decreased but do not accompany signs of anemia may indicate advanced liver damage, as the liver is the major site of production of haptoglobin.

As haptoglobin is an acute-phase protein, any inflammatory process (infection, injury, allergy, etc.) may increase the levels of plasma haptoglobin, but patients with haemolysis usually have low haptoglobin regardless of the presence of inflammation

<text>In frequentist statistics, power is a measure of the ability of an experimental design and hypothesis testing setup to detect a particular effect if it is truly present. In typical use, it is a function of the test used (including the desired level of statistical significance), the assumed distribution of the test (for example, the degree of variability, and sample size), and the effect size of interest. High statistical power is related to low variability, large sample sizes, large effects being looked for, and less stringent requirements for statistical significance.

More formally, in the case of a simple hypothesis test with two hypotheses, the power of the test is the probability that the test correctly rejects the null hypothesis (formula_1) when the alternative hypothesis (formula_2) is true. It is commonly denoted by formula_3, where formula_4 is the probability of making a type¬†II error (a false negative) conditional on there being a true effect or association.

==Background==

Statistical testing uses data from samples to assess, or make inferences about, a statistical population. For example, we may measure the yields of samples of two varieties of a crop, and use a two sample test to assess whether the mean values of this yield differs between varieties.

Under a frequentist hypothesis testing framework, this is done by calculating a test statistic (such as a t-statistic) for the dataset, which has a known theoretical probability distribution if there is no difference (the so called null hypothesis). If the actual value calculated on the sample is sufficiently unlikely to arise under the null hypothesis, we say we identified a statistically significant effect.

The threshold for significance can be set small to ensure there is little chance of falsely detecting a non-existent effect. However, failing to identify a significant effect does not imply there was none. If we insist on being careful to avoid false positives, we may create false negatives instead. It may simply be too much to expect that we will be able to find satisfactorily strong evidence of a very subtle difference even if it exists. Statistical power is an attempt to quantify this issue.

In the case of the comparison of the two crop varieties, it enables us to answer questions like:
* Is there a big danger of two very different varieties producing samples that just happen to look indistinguishable by pure chance?
* How much effort do we need to put into this comparison to avoid that danger?
* How different do these varieties need to be before we can expect to notice a difference?

==Description==

Suppose we are conducting a hypothesis test. We define two hypotheses formula_1 the null hypothesis, and formula_2 the alternative hypothesis. If we design the test such that &quot;Œ±&quot; is the significance level - being the probability of rejecting formula_1 when formula_1 is in fact true, then the power of the test is 1 - &quot;Œ≤&quot; where &quot;Œ≤&quot; is the probability of failing to reject formula_1 when the alternative formula_2 is true.

To make this more concrete, a typical statistical test would be based on a test statistic &quot;t&quot; calculated from the sampled data, which has a particular probability distribution under formula_1. A desired significance level &quot;Œ±&quot; would then define a corresponding &quot;rejection region&quot; (bounded by certain &quot;critical values&quot;), a set of values &quot;t&quot; is unlikely to take if formula_1 was correct. If we reject formula_1 in favor of formula_2 only when the sample &quot;t&quot; takes those values, we would be able to keep the probability of falsely rejecting formula_1 within our desired significance level. At the same time, if formula_2 defines its own probability distribution for &quot;t&quot; (the difference between the two distributions being a function of the effect size), the power of the test would be the probability, under formula_2, that the sample &quot;t&quot; falls into our defined rejection region and causes formula_1 to be correctly rejected.

Statistical power is one minus the type¬†II error probability and is also the sensitivity of the hypothesis testing procedure to detect a true effect. There is usually a trade-off between demanding more stringent tests (and so, smaller rejection regions) and trying to have a high probability of rejecting the null under the alternative hypothesis. Statistical power may also be extended to the case where multiple hypotheses are being tested based on an experiment or survey. It is thus also common to refer to the power of a study, evaluating a scientific project in terms of its ability to answer the research questions they are seeking to answer.

== Applications ==
The main application of statistical power is &quot;power analysis&quot;, a calculation of power usually done before an experiment is conducted using data from pilot studies or a literature review. Power analyses can be used to calculate the minimum sample size required so that one can be reasonably likely to detect an effect of a given size (in other words, producing an acceptable level of power). For example: &quot;How many times do I need to toss a coin to conclude it is rigged by a certain amount?&quot; If resources and thus sample sizes are fixed, power analyses can also be used to calculate the minimum effect size that is likely to be detected.

Funding agencies, ethics boards and research review panels frequently request that a researcher perform a power analysis. An underpowered study is likely be inconclusive, failing to allow one to choose between hypotheses at the desired significance level, while an overpowered study will spend great expense on being able to report significant effects even if they are tiny and so practically meaningless. If a large number of underpowered studies are done and statistically significant results published, published findings are more likely false positives than true results, contributing to a replication crisis. However, excessive demands for power could be connected to wasted resources and ethical problems, for example the use of a large number of animal test subjects when a smaller number would have been sufficient. It could also induce researchers trying to seek funding to overstate their expected effect sizes, or avoid looking for more subtle interaction effects that cannot be easily detected.

Power analysis is primarily a frequentist statistics tool. In Bayesian statistics, hypothesis testing of the type used in classical power analysis is not done. In the Bayesian framework, one updates his or her prior beliefs using the data obtained in a given study. In principle, a study that would be deemed underpowered from the perspective of hypothesis testing could still be used in such an updating process. However, power remains a useful measure of how much a given experiment size can be expected to refine one&#x27;s beliefs. A study with low power is unlikely to lead to a large change in beliefs.

In addition, the concept of power is used to make comparisons between different statistical testing procedures: for example, between a parametric test and a nonparametric test of the same hypothesis. Tests may have the same size, and hence the same false positive rates, but different ability to detect true effects. Consideration of their theoretical power proprieties is a key reason for the common use of likelihood ratio tests.

== Rule of thumb for t-test ==
Lehr&#x27;s (rough) rule of thumb says that the sample size formula_19 (for each group) for the common case of a two-sided two-sample t-test with power 80% (formula_20) and significance level formula_21 should be:
formula_22
where formula_23 is an estimate of the population variance and formula_24 the to-be-detected difference in the mean values of both samples. This expression can be rearranged, implying for example that 80% power is obtained when looking for a difference in means that exceeds about 4 times the group-wise standard error of the mean.

For a one sample t-test 16 is to be replaced with 8. Other values provide an appropriate approximation when the desired power or significance level are different.

However, a full power analysis should always be performed to confirm and refine this estimate.

==Factors influencing power==

Statistical power may depend on a number of factors. Some factors may be particular to a specific testing situation, but in normal use, power depends on the following three aspects that can be potentially controlled by the practitioner:

* the test itself and the statistical significance criterion used
* the magnitude of the effect of interest
* the size and variability of the sample used to detect the effect

For a given test, the significance criterion determines the desired degree of rigor, specifying how unlikely it is for the null hypothesis of no effect to be rejected if it is in fact true. The most commonly used threshold is a probability of rejection of 0.05, though smaller values like 0.01 or 0.001 are sometimes used. This threshold then implies that the observation must be at least that unlikely (perhaps by suggesting a sufficiently large estimate of difference) to be considered strong enough evidence against the null. Picking a smaller value to tighten the threshold, so as to reduce the chance of a false positive, would also reduce power, increase the chance of a false negative. Some statistical tests will inherently produce better power, albeit often at the cost of requiring stronger assumptions.

The magnitude of the effect of interest defines what is being looked for by the test. It can be the expected effect size if it exists, as a scientific hypothesis that the researcher has arrived at and wishes to test. Alternatively, in a more practical context it could be determined by the size the effect must be to be useful, for example that which is required to be clinically significant. An effect size can be a direct value of the quantity of interest (for example, a difference in mean of a particular size), or it can be a standardized measure that also accounts for the variability in the population (such as a difference in means expressed as a multiple of the standard deviation). If the researcher is looking for a larger effect, then it should be easier to find with a given experimental or analytic setup, and so power is higher.

The nature of the sample underlies the information being used in the test. This will usually involve the sample size, and the sample variability, if that is not implicit in the definition of the effect size. More broadly, the precision with which the data are measured can also be an important factor (such as the statistical reliability), as well as the design of an experiment or observational study. Ultimately, these factors lead to an expected amount of sampling error. A smaller sampling error could be obtained by larger sample sizes from a less variability population, from more accurate measurements, or from more efficient experimental designs (for example, with the appropriate use of blocking), and such smaller errors would lead to improved power, albeit usually at a cost in resources. How increased sample size translates to higher power is a measure of the efficiency of the test¬†‚Äì for example, the sample size required for a given power.

==Discussion==
The statistical power of a hypothesis test has an impact on the interpretation of its results. Not finding a result with a more powerful study is stronger evidence against the effect existing than the same finding with a less powerful study. However, this is not completely conclusive. The effect may exist, but be smaller than what was looked for, meaning the study is in fact underpowered and the sample is thus unable to distinguish it from random chance. Many clinical trials, for instance, have low statistical power to detect differences in adverse effects of treatments, since such effects may only affect a few patients, even if this difference can be important. Conclusions about the probability of actual presence of an effect also should consider more things than a single test, especially as real world power is rarely close to 1.

Indeed, although there are no formal standards for power, many researchers and funding bodies assess power using 0.80 (or 80%) as a standard for adequacy. This convention implies a four-to-one trade off between -risk and -risk, as the probability of a type¬†II error is set as 1 - 0.8 = 0.2, while Œ±, the probability of a type¬†I error, is commonly set at 0.05. Some applications require much higher levels of power. Medical tests may be designed to minimise the number of false negatives (type¬†II errors) produced by loosening the threshold of significance, raising the risk of obtaining a false positive (a type¬†I error). The rationale is that it is better to tell a healthy patient &quot;we may have found something‚Äîlet&#x27;s test further,&quot; than to tell a diseased patient &quot;all is well.&quot;

Power analysis focuses on the correct rejection of a null hypothesis. Alternative concerns may however motivate an experiment, and so lead to different needs for sample size. In many contexts, the issue is less about deciding between hypotheses but rather with getting an estimate of the population effect size of sufficient accuracy. For example, a careful power analysis can tell you that 55 pairs of normally distributed samples with a correlation of 0.5 will be sufficient to grant 80% power in rejecting a null that the correlation is no more than 0.2 (using a one-sided test, ¬†=¬†0.05). But the typical 95% confidence interval with this sample would be around [0.27, 0.67]. An alternative, albeit related analysis would be required if we wish to be able to measure correlation to an accuracy of +/- 0.1, implying a different (in this case, larger) sample size. Alternatively, multiple under-powered studies can still be useful, if appropriately combined through a meta-analysis.

Many statistical analyses involve the estimation of several unknown quantities. In simple cases, all but one of these quantities are nuisance parameters. In this setting, the only relevant power pertains to the single quantity that will undergo formal statistical inference. In some settings, particularly if the goals are more &quot;exploratory&quot;, there may be a number of quantities of interest in the analysis. For example, in a multiple regression analysis we may include several covariates of potential interest. In situations such as this where several hypotheses are under consideration, it is common that the powers associated with the different hypotheses differ. For instance, in multiple regression analysis, the power for detecting an effect of a given size is related to the variance of the covariate. Since different covariates will have different variances, their powers will differ as well.

Additional complications arise when we consider these multiple hypotheses together. For example, if we consider a false positive to be making an erroneous null rejection on any one of these hypotheses, our likelihood of this &quot;family-wise error&quot; will be inflated if appropriate measures are not taken. Such measures typically involve applying a higher threshold of stringency to reject a hypothesis (such as with the Bonferroni method), and so would reduce power. Alternatively, there may be different notions of power connected with how the different hypotheses are considered. &quot;Complete power&quot; demands that all true effects are detected across all of the hypotheses, which is a much stronger requirement than the &quot;minimal power&quot; of being able to find at least one true effect, a type of power that might increase with an increasing number of hypotheses.

==&quot;A priori&quot; vs. &quot;post hoc&quot; analysis==

Power analysis can either be done before (&quot;a priori&quot; or prospective power analysis) or after (&quot;post hoc&quot; or retrospective power analysis) data are collected. &quot;A priori&quot; power analysis is conducted prior to the research study, and is typically used in estimating sufficient sample sizes to achieve adequate power. &quot;Post-hoc&quot; analysis of &quot;observed power&quot; is conducted after a study has been completed, and uses the obtained sample size and effect size to determine what the power was in the study, assuming the effect size in the sample is equal to the effect size in the population. Whereas the utility of prospective power analysis in experimental design is universally accepted, post hoc power analysis is fundamentally flawed. Falling for the temptation to use the statistical analysis of the collected data to estimate the power will result in uninformative and misleading values. In particular, it has been shown that &quot;post-hoc&quot; &quot;observed power&quot; is a one-to-one function of the &quot;p&quot;-value attained. This has been extended to show that all &quot;post-hoc&quot; power analyses suffer from what is called the &quot;power approach paradox&quot; (PAP), in which a study with a null result is thought to show &quot;more&quot; evidence that the null hypothesis is actually true when the &quot;p&quot;-value is smaller, since the apparent power to detect an actual effect would be higher. In fact, a smaller &quot;p&quot;-value is properly understood to make the null hypothesis &quot;relatively&quot; less likely to be true.

==Example==
The following is an example that shows how to compute power for a randomized experiment: Suppose the goal of an experiment is to study the effect of a treatment on some quantity, and so we shall compare research subjects by measuring the quantity before and after the treatment, analyzing the data using a one-sided paired t-test, with a significance level threshold of 0.05. We are interested in being able to detect a positive change of size formula_25.

We first set up the problem according to our test. Let formula_26 and formula_27 denote the pre-treatment and post-treatment measures on subject formula_28, respectively. The possible effect of the treatment should be visible in the differences formula_29 which are assumed to be independent and identically Normal in distribution, with unknown mean value formula_30 and variance formula_31.

Here, it is natural to choose our null hypothesis to be that the expected mean difference is zero, i.e. formula_32 For our one-sided test, the alternative hypothesis would be that there is a positive effect, corresponding to formula_33 The test statistic in this case is defined as:

formula_34

where formula_35 is the mean under the null so we substitute in 0, is the sample size (number of subjects), formula_36 is the sample mean of the difference

formula_37

and formula_38 is the sample standard deviation of the difference.

=== Analytic solution ===

We can proceed according to our knowledge of statistical theory, though in practice for a standard case like this software will exist to compute more accurate answers.

Thanks to t-test theory, we know this test statistic under the null hypothesis follows a Student t-distribution with formula_39 degrees of freedom. If we wish to reject the null at significance level formula_40, we must find the critical value formula_41 such that the probability of formula_42 under the null is equal to formula_43. If is large, the t-distribution converges to the standard normal distribution (thus no longer involving ) and so through use of the corresponding quantile function formula_44, we obtain that the null should be rejected if

formula_45

Now suppose that the alternative hypothesis formula_2 is true so formula_47. Then, writing the power as a function of the effect size, formula_48, we find the probability of formula_49 being above formula_41 under formula_2.

formula_52

formula_53 again follows a student-t distribution under formula_2, converging on to a standard normal distribution for large . The estimated formula_55 will also converge on to its population value formula_56 Thus power can be approximated as

formula_57

According to this formula, the power increases with the values of the effect size formula_58 and the sample size , and reduces with increasing variability formula_56. In the trivial case of zero effect size, power is at a minimum (infimum) and equal to the significance level of the test formula_60 in this example 0.05. For finite sample sizes and non-zero variability, it is the case here, as is typical, that power cannot be made equal to 1 except in the trivial case where formula_61 so the null is &quot;always&quot; rejected.

We can invert formula_62 to obtain required sample sizes:

formula_63

Suppose formula_64 and we believe formula_56 is around 2, say, then we require for a power of formula_66, a sample size

formula_67

=== Simulation solution ===

Alternatively we can use a Monte Carlo simulation method that works more generally. Once again, we return to the assumption of the distribution of formula_68 and the definition of formula_49. Suppose we have fixed values of the sample size, variability and effect size, and wish to compute power. We can adopt this process:

1. Generate a large number of sets of formula_68 according to the null hypothesis, formula_71

2. Compute the resulting test statistic formula_49 for each set.

3. Compute the formula_73th quantile of the simulated formula_49 and use that as an estimate of formula_75.

4. Now generate a large number of sets of formula_68 according to the alternative hypothesis, formula_77, and compute the corresponding test statistics again.

5. Look at the proportion of these simulated alternative formula_49 that are above the formula_75 calculated in step 3 and so are rejected. This is the power.

This can be done with a variety of software packages. Using this methodology with the values before, setting the sample size to 25 leads to an estimated power of around 0.78. The small discrepancy with the previous section is due mainly to inaccuracies with the normal approximation.

== Extension ==
=== Bayesian power ===
In the frequentist setting, parameters are assumed to have a specific value which is unlikely to be true. This issue can be addressed by assuming the parameter has a distribution. The resulting power is sometimes referred to as Bayesian power which is commonly used in clinical trial design.

=== Predictive probability of success ===
Both frequentist power and Bayesian power use statistical significance as the success criterion. However, statistical significance is often not enough to define success. To address this issue, the power concept can be extended to the concept of predictive probability of success (PPOS). The success criterion for PPOS is not restricted to statistical significance and is commonly used in clinical trial designs.

<text>The Northwest Angle, known simply as the Angle by locals, and coextensive with Angle Township, is a pene-exclave of northern Lake of the Woods County, Minnesota. Excluding surveying errors, it is the only place in the contiguous United States north of the 49th parallel, which forms the border between the U.S. and Canada from the Northwest Angle westward to the Strait of Georgia (between the U.S. state of Washington and the Canadian province of British Columbia). The land area of the Angle is separated from the rest of Minnesota by Lake of the Woods, but shares a land border with Canada. It is one of six non-island locations in the 48 contiguous states that are practical exclaves of the United States. Oak Island, Angle Inlet and Penasse are in the Northwest Angle.

Seventy percent of the land of the Angle is held in trust by the Red Lake Indian Reservation (Ojibwa).

The Angle is listed as one of several distinct regions of Minnesota, and is the smallest of those regions, with a total population of 149 at the 2020 United States Census, up from 119 in 2010. The area is mostly water and the land is mostly forest.

==Origin==
Angle Township was designated as territory of the United States because negotiators of the initial Canada‚ÄìU.S. border misunderstood the geography of the area. Benjamin Franklin and British representatives relied on the Mitchell Map of colonial American geographer John Mitchell, which did not indicate the source of the Mississippi River‚Äîthought to lie some distance to the northwest‚Äîor the true shape of Lake of the Woods, which was instead shown as roughly oval. The 1783 Treaty of Paris thus stated that the boundary between U.S. territory and the British possessions to the north would run &quot;...through the Lake of the Woods to the northwesternmost point thereof, and from thence on a due west course to the river Mississippi...&quot;

But the source of the Mississippi River, Lake Itasca (then unknown to European explorers), lies almost due south of Lake of the Woods, rather than north and west of it. Additionally, the irregular actual shape of the lake made the identification of its northwest corner difficult. By the time of the Jay Treaty of 1794, there was concern that the Mississippi did not go far enough north, and so as part of that treaty it was decided that a joint survey of the river would be conducted, and if it did not extend far enough north that new, &quot;amicable negotiations&quot; would be undertaken to set the boundary in accordance with the intent of the Treaty of Paris. In 1797, it was confirmed when David Thompson, an explorer, located the most northerly source of the Mississippi a few miles north of Bemidji, which is south of Lake of the Woods.

When the Treaty of Ghent was signed in 1814, it again tried to settle the boundary, this time by creating a commission that would settle on the northwestern point of the Lake of the Woods. The British had suggested setting the boundary to run west from Lake Superior to Lake Itasca, the headwaters of the Mississippi, but the Americans were unwilling to cede any land at that point. As part of the negotiations over that treaty, both parties agreed to revisit the boundary west from the Lake of the Woods. 

By the time Richard Rush became U.S. Secretary of State in 1817, settlers were beginning to move to the lands west of the Lake of the Woods and both sides saw a need to settle the boundary west of the 1783 line. In the Anglo-American Convention of 1818, the error regarding the Mississippi River was corrected by having the boundary continue due north or south (‚Äúas the case may be‚Äù) from the northwest point of the lake (which had still not been determined) to the 49th parallel and then due west along the parallel. 

To determine the northwesternmost point of the lake a survey team was sent in 1822, but they failed to come to an answer. Another survey team, led by David Thompson in 1824, mapped the lake and found four possibilities for the northwesternmost point, but did not conclusively declare one location.
In 1825, a German astronomer in British service, Johann Ludwig Tiarks, surveyed the lake. Tiarks identified two possibilities for the northwesternmost point on the lake, based on Thompson&#x27;s maps: the Angle Inlet and Rat Portage. To determine which point was the most northwestern, he drew a line from each point in the southwest‚Äìnortheast direction. If the line intersected the lake at any point, it was not the most northwestern point. Tiarks determined that the only such line that did not intersect the lake was at the edge of a pond on the Angle Inlet. A 1940 academic study documents this point as being in the vicinity of (NAD83).

The Webster‚ÄìAshburton Treaty of 1842 reaffirmed this border and established the exact location of the northwesternmost point of the lake. The placement of the northwestern corner and shape of the lake meant that this north‚Äìsouth line cut off a section of U.S. territory to its east, now known as the Northwest Angle.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, Angle Township has a total area of , of which is land and (79.36%) is water. The land includes several islands, including Oak Island, and two small capes that are below (south of) the 49th parallel north in the extreme southwest part of the township, one of which is known as Elm Point, south of the southeast corner of Manitoba, and not far from the northeast corner of Roseau County. Of the 2000 census population of 152, there were 118 living on the mainland, and 34 persons on the islands in Lake of the Woods. All of the populated islands are north of the 49th parallel.

The mainland portion of the township north of the 49th parallel has an area of . The total land area of all islands is , and the two capes total . The township has the last one-room public school in the state.

Elm Point, in Lake of the Woods County, is a small cape southwest of the Northwest Angle. It borders Canada and is, together with a similar smaller cape to the west, separated by land from the continental United States.

===Access===
The Angle is accessible from the rest of Minnesota by one of two ways:
* The Angle can be reached without crossing the international border by crossing the Lake of the Woods. This can be done by boat when the lake is free of ice, by ice road in the winter or by flying over it in a plane. No automobile ferries currently operate on the lake, so vehicles coming from the rest of Minnesota cannot reach the Angle without crossing the border except in winter. While the ice is forming in late autumn and breaking up in the spring, the lake&#x27;s surface cannot be crossed safely at these times domestic access to the Angle is possible only by air. In January 2021, local U.S. interests opened a toll road across the ice, at a round-trip charge of US$120 to $145, because the Canadian border was closed by COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. It was again opened, and lengthened to of road, in January 2022, and the toll set at $250.
* To reach the Angle by land, travelers take Minnesota State Highway 313 northbound (Warroad, Minnesota, to Sprague, Manitoba) across the Warroad-Sprague Border Crossing connecting to Manitoba Highway 12 at the border, then to Provincial Road 308, to Provincial Road 525, then finally crossing back into the United States in the Northwest Angle south of Angle Inlet, Minnesota (Angle Inlet Township). The distance from Warroad or Roseau to the Angle proper is approximately through Minnesota and Manitoba back to the Angle&#x27;s U.S. border. It is approximately from the actual border (intersection of Manitoba 525 and NWA Road Dawson) to the rural developments of the Northwest Angle.
* The border crossing is unstaffed. Travelers using the single gravel road into the Angle are instructed to use an iPad kiosk at Jim&#x27;s Corner, Young&#x27;s Bay Marina, or Carlson&#x27;s Landing to contact U.S. Customs. Exiting the Angle, travelers use a telephone at the same locations to contact Canadian Customs to make their declarations. After checking in via either direction, travelers are provided a case number to reference in the event they are questioned.

==Political issues==
Because of laws restricting fishing, some residents of the Northwest Angle suggested leaving the United States and joining Canada in 1997. The following year, then-U.S. representative Collin Peterson of Minnesota proposed legislation to allow the residents of the Northwest Angle, which was part of his district, to vote on seceding from the United States and joining Canada. This angered the leaders of Red Lake Indian Reservation, which holds most of the Northwest Angle&#x27;s land. The incident resulted in fishing regulations being better synchronized across these waters.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2010, there were 119 people, 66 households, and 37 families residing in the Angle. There were 404 housing units. The racial makeup of the township was 99.2% White (118 out of 119). Native American or Alaska Native of any race were 0.8% of the population (that is, 1 person).

Out of the 66 households, 10.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 54.5% were married couples living together, 0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 43.9% were non-families. 37.9% of all households were made up of individuals, and 3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 1.80, and the average family size was 2.32.

In the Angle the population is spread out, with 10.1% under the age of 18, 0.8% from 18 to 24, 10.1% from 25 to 44, 51.3% from 45 to 64, and 27.6% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 50 years. For every 100 females, there were 120.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 124.1 males.

The median income for a household in the township was $28,500, and the median income for a family was $31,250. Males had a median income of $28,500 versus $21,250 for females. The per capita income for the township was $13,932. About 13.3% of families and 12.3% of the population were below the poverty line, including none of those under the age of 18 or 65 and older.

==Climate==

According to the K√∂ppen climate classification system, the Northwest Angle has a Warm-summer, Humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;). &quot;Dfb&quot; climates are characterized by at least one month having an average mean temperature ‚â§ , at least four months with an average mean temperature ‚â• , all months with an average mean temperature &lt; and no significant precipitation difference between seasons. Although most summer days are comfortably humid in the Northwest Angle, episodes of heat and high humidity can occur with heat index values &gt; . The Northwest Angle weather station is one of the newer ones, as it only began keeping records in 1981, in contrast with nearby International Falls which has been keeping records for over a century. Since 1981, the highest air temperature was on July 5, 1988, and the highest daily average mean dew point was on August 4, 2001. Since 1981, the wettest calendar day was on June 9, 2002. During the winter months, the average annual extreme minimum air temperature is , putting it in hardiness zone 3a. Since 1981, the coldest air temperature was on February 2, 2002. Episodes of extreme cold and wind can occur with wind chill values under . The average annual snowfall total (Sep‚ÄìMay) is between and .

==Ecology==

According to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. potential natural vegetation types, the Northwest Angle would have a dominant vegetation type of Great Lakes Spruce/Fir (&quot;93&quot;) with a dominant vegetation form of Northern Conifer Forest (&quot;22&quot;). The plant hardiness zone is 3a with an average annual extreme minimum air temperature of . The spring bloom typically peaks in mid-May and fall color usually peaks in late September.

==Representation in other media==
* Ernie Pyle wrote several columns about the Northwest Angle and its residents, which were collected in &quot;Home Country&quot; (1947), published posthumously.
* The American writer Tim O&#x27;Brien set his bestselling novel &quot;In the Lake of the Woods&quot; (1994) in the Angle. His short story &quot;On the Rainy River&quot; is also set there.
* William Kent Krueger&#x27;s novel &quot;Northwest Angle&quot; (2011) is set in the area.
* The Danny Orlis series of books, a Christian fiction series for youth, were largely set in the Northwest Angle.

<doc id="238700" wikidata="Q877319" url="?curid=238700" title="Lake Itasca">
<text>Lake Itasca ( ) is a small glacial lake, approximately in area. It is located in Itasca State Park, in south-eastern Clearwater County, in the Headwaters area of north-central Minnesota, and is notable for being the headwater of the Mississippi River. It has an average depth of and is above sea level.

The Ojibwe name for the lake is &quot;Omashkoozo-zaaga&#x27;igan&quot; (Elk Lake). The first European explorers in the area were French Canadian and they named the lake &quot;Lac Labiche&quot; (Doe Lake, often mistranslated as Elk Lake). The name was later changed by Henry Schoolcraft to &quot;Itasca&quot;, coined from a combination of the Latin phrase &quot;veritas caput&quot; (&quot;true head [of the Mississippi]&quot;). It is one of several examples of pseudo-Native American place names created by Schoolcraft.

==Source of the Mississippi River==

It is the primary source of the Mississippi River which flows 2,340¬†mi (3,770¬†km) to the Gulf of Mexico. There are several tributaries that flow (most or all of the year) into the lake, one of which, by most modern definitions, as with the Nile River and Amazon River, would be considered the actual source, though less dramatic than the lake&#x27;s outflow. 

The western arm of the lake is fed by two streams on its south end. Nicollet Creek starts in a nearby spring. Another small stream leads into Itasca from Elk Lake, which in turn is fed by two other streams. The Ojibwa called Elk Lake and the stream &quot;Bekegamaag-zaaga&#x27;igan&quot; and &quot;Bekegamaag-ziibi&quot; (Sidelake Lake and Sidelake River), respectively. In 1887 Williard Glazier promoted a campaign to consider Elk Lake, which he called Glazier Lake, as the true source of the Mississippi. Its longest tributary originates at Little Elk Lake, which is 100¬†ft (30 m) higher in elevation and 11¬†km upstream from the Lake Itasca outflow, at and in the Mississippi watershed.

== History ==
Henry Schoolcraft identified Lake Itasca as the river&#x27;s primary source in 1832. He had been part of a previous expedition in 1820 led by General Lewis Cass that had named nearby Cass Lake (which is downstream from Itasca) as the source of the river. There exists a dissenting claim that fur trader William Morrison was the first person to discover the lake and identified it as the source of the Mississippi in 1804.

Jacob V. Brower, a land surveyor and president of the Minnesota Historical Society, after spending five months exploring the lakes, claimed that the lakes and streams further south of Lake Itasca were not the true source of the Mississippi because they were &quot;too small&quot;. Modern explorers and geographers, however, have used the tiniest trickles of water to determine the source of the Amazon, Nile, and other rivers. Brower was to campaign aggressively to save the lake from logging. On April 21, 1891, the Minnesota Legislature officially made it a state park by a margin of one vote. Brower is now called the &quot;Father of Lake Itasca&quot; and the visitor center is named in his honor.

The channel of the Mississippi as it emerges from the lake was bulldozed in the 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps, to create a more &quot;pleasant experience&quot; for visitors. The project included the draining of the surrounding swamp, the digging of a new channel, and the installation of a man-made rock rapids. The rocks are used by tourists for walking across the Mississippi River. This outlet channel underwent restoration work in October of 2020. The channel was reshaped direct water away from the shoreline, reducing erosive effects. The Minnesota DNR stabilized the shoreline with a combination of boulders and natural vegetation. Although the path of the stepping stones were reshaped, the underlying dam was unchanged. 

==Common ground for science==

The lake is home to the University of Minnesota&#x27;s Itasca Biological Station and Laboratories campus, which offers spring and summer courses and field research work year-round. The campus was established in 1909. Some of these buildings date from the 1930s and 40s, while others, including the largest building the Biome Center, were built more recently. The current Director of the biological station is Jonathan Schilling.

The Lake Itasca region claims a unique location, not only at the headwaters of the Mississippi River and amidst 25% of the old growth forest of Minnesota, but also at the juncture of the three great habitats of North America: the Great Plains, the Deciduous Forest of the south, and the Coniferous Forest of the north. Remnants of all three may be observed in the park.

The unique geography of the Lake Itasca region has found its way onto the classical music concert stage. Composer Ferde Grof√© depicted the birthplace of the Mississippi River and the Native Americans who reside there in his popular classical epic the &quot;Mississippi Suite&quot;.

<text>Lake of the Woods (; ) is a lake occupying parts of the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Manitoba and the U.S. state of Minnesota. Lake of the Woods is over long and wide, containing more than 14,552 islands and of shoreline. It is fed by the Rainy River, Shoal Lake, Kakagi Lake and other smaller rivers. The lake drains into the Winnipeg River and then into Lake Winnipeg. Ultimately, its outflow goes north through the Nelson River to Hudson Bay.
Lake of the Woods is also the sixth largest freshwater lake located (at least partially) in the United States, after the five Great Lakes, and the 36th largest lake in the world by area. It separates a small land area of Minnesota from the rest of the United States. The Northwest Angle and the town of Angle Township can be reached from the rest of Minnesota only by crossing the lake or by traveling through Canada. The Northwest Angle is the northernmost part of the contiguous United States. Its &quot;northwesternmost point&quot; served as a problematic landmark in treaties defining the international border.

The lake&#x27;s islands provide nesting habitats for the piping plover and large numbers of American white pelicans and as recently as the early 20th century also provided calving habitat to boreal woodland caribou. There are also several hundred nesting pairs of bald eagles in this area.

Lake of the Woods, a translation of the original French name , was so named from its wooded setting. However, it may have been a mistranslation of the Anishinaabe name.

The earliest name we find the lake known by is that given by Verendrye in his journey in 1731. He says it was called Lake Minitic (Cree: ; Ojibwe: ) or Des Bois. (1) The former of these names, Minitic, seems to be Anishinaabe, and to mean &quot;Islands in a River&quot;, probably referring to the many islands found in the northern half of the lake. The other name (2) Lac des Bois, or Lake of the Woods, seems to have been a mistranslation of the Indian [sic] name (Anishinaabe) by which the Lake was known.

One of the names currently used in Anishinaabe for this lake is meaning &quot;Lake with Uneven Sand&quot; referring to the lake&#x27;s sand dunes.

==Governance==
The construction of dams at the Lake of the Woods outlets in present-day Kenora in the late 19th century led to concerns over high and low water levels on the lake early in the 20th century. The federal governments of Canada and the United States referred the matter to the International Joint Commission (IJC) in 1912. In 1917 the IJC recommended the creation of control boards and the operating conditions they would apply to lake level management. The first of these boards, the Lake of the Woods Control Board (LWCB), was established by Canadian Order-in-Council in 1919. Two additional acts provided statutory establishment of the LWCB, defined its jurisdiction and powers, and provided for board members appointed by Canada and Ontario: the &quot;Lake of the Woods Control Board Act&quot;, Canada, 1921, the &quot;Lake of the Woods Control Board Act&quot;, Ontario, 1922. In 1922, the Canada-Ontario-Manitoba Tripartite Agreement was signed by the respective governments. Initially, only Canada and Ontario appointed members to the board as, at that time, natural resources in Manitoba were administered by Canada. In 1958, having gained control over its natural resources, Manitoba passed its own &quot;Lake of the Woods Control Board Act&quot;. That same year, Canada and Ontario amended their original versions of the acts. As a result of these legislative changes, the LWCB now has one member appointed by Canada, two appointed by Ontario, and one appointed by Manitoba.

Following the IJC recommendations of 1917, discussions between the federal governments of Canada and the United States resulted in the 1925 Canada/USA Convention and Protocol regarding Lake of the Woods. This treaty established the water level operating range on Lake of the Woods, defined the purpose and general mode of operation, and provided for two boards to control regulation. The previously established Canadian LWCB was to regulate the lake on an ongoing basis, but its decisions were to be subject to approval by an International Lake of the Woods Control Board (ILWCB) whenever lake levels rose above or fell below certain limits. In cases where agreement could not be reached between Canadian and American members of the international board, the disputed matter would be referred to the IJC for the final decision. The International Lake of the Woods Control Board, however, is not a board created by the IJC. The board&#x27;s members (one American and one Canadian) are appointed by the respective federal governments.

Shoal Lake is adjacent to the Lake of the Woods and is the source for the City of Winnipeg drinking water via the Greater Winnipeg Water District Aqueduct, so the administration of the lake is of continuing interest to the governments of Winnipeg and Manitoba.

==Lands within Lake of the Woods==
===Aulneau Peninsula===
The largest land feature in Lake of the Woods is the Aulneau Peninsula. It is connected to the mainland with a tiny neck of land at its southeast corner, but a canal (Turtle Portage ) was cut through at this point, effectively making the Aulneau an island. The canal has now been filled back in. A manually run portage for small- to medium-sized boats is in its place. The Aulneau is approximately twenty miles long (32¬†km) and wide. It contains within it over eighty lakes, the largest of which is Arrow Lake, with thirteen islands in it.

The Aulneau Peninsula was named after the Jesuit Father Jean-Pierre Aulneau, a French Catholic priest, who was killed by natives on 8 June 1736 on Lake of the Woods. The Catholic Church in Warroad, Minnesota, is named Father Aulneau Memorial Church in his honour.

===Other islands===
* Big Island
* Bigsby Island
* Brush Island, Minnesota
* Chapel Island An island about 15¬†km out from Kenora, where a chapel once stood. When the natives would canoe from end to end for purposes of trading, Chapel Island was a rest stop where the white settlers would try to convert the Native population, and offered a refuge in bad weather. The chapel has since burnt down, and little remains.
* Copeland Island, otherwise known as Camp Stephens. A Winnipeg YM-YWCA summer camp.
* Flag Island, Minnesota
* Garden Island, Minnesota
* Little Oak Island, Minnesota
* Magnuson&#x27;s Island, site of the restored Fort St. Charles
* Massacre Island, Ontario a small island in the middle of the lake, the possible site where twenty French men, as well as a group of Cree traders, were beheaded in the mid 18th century by Sioux. The site is marked by a large wooden cross in the middle of the island. This incident sparked decades of war between the Sioux and the Ojibway, allies of both the French and the Cree.
* Oak Island, Minnesota
* Penasse Island, site of American Point, formerly the most northern post office in the contiguous United States
* Sultana Mine, a mine on an island in the northern area of the lake in the late 1800s, before an accident shut down the mine. Stories about it being haunted by miners exist to this day.

==Recreation on Lake of the Woods==

Tourism is a large part of the local economy of Lake of the Woods, and there are many recreational opportunities available on the lake and in the surrounding countryside. Much of the lake is fairly remote, but resorts and equipment outfitters offer options for those who do not have access to their own boats and equipment.

Several parks are located in and on the lake, including:
* Lake of the Woods Provincial Park
* Assabaska Heritage Park
* Sable Islands Provincial Nature Reserve

===Camping===

Minnesota&#x27;s Zippel Bay State Park offers a wide variety of services including campsites, toilet facilities, a marina with access to the Zippel River, and a beach. Minnesota and Ontario both offer state-sanctioned parks and campsites, which can be located through the respective governments. Backcountry campers can locate a prospective campsite on Lake of the Woods by boat, landing and examine the site in person. There is abundant wildlife even on the small islands on the lake.

Numerous marinas and resorts on the lake provide accommodation and dining, houseboat rentals, nautical charts, camping and fishing advice, and knowledge on how to most enjoy the lake.

===Fishing===

Lake of the Woods is home to walleye, northern pike, perch, sauger, crappie, panfish, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, lake trout, lake sturgeon, and muskellunge. Lake of the Woods is nicknamed the &quot;Walleye capital of the world&quot;. The lake is the host of year-round fishing, with ice fishing being a popular recreation activity on the lake.

===Royal Lake of the Woods Yacht Club===

Lake of the Woods is also home to the Royal Lake of the Woods Yacht Club.

<text>Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP, Œ±-fetoprotein; also sometimes called alpha-1-fetoprotein, alpha-fetoglobulin, or alpha fetal protein) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the &quot;AFP&quot; gene. The &quot;AFP&quot; gene is located on the &quot;q&quot; arm of chromosome 4 (4q13.3). Maternal AFP serum level is used to screen for Down syndrome, neural tube defects, and other chromosomal abnormalities.

AFP is a major plasma protein produced by the yolk sac and the fetal liver during fetal development. It is thought to be the fetal analog of serum albumin. AFP binds to copper, nickel, fatty acids and bilirubin and is found in monomeric, dimeric and trimeric forms.

== Structure ==

AFP is a glycoprotein of 591 amino acids and a carbohydrate moiety.

== Function ==
The function of AFP in adult humans is unknown. AFP is the most abundant plasma protein found in the human fetus. In the fetus, AFP is produced by both the liver and the yolk sac. It is believed to function as a carrier protein (similar to albumin) that transports materials such as fatty acids to cells. Maternal plasma levels peak near the end of the first trimester, and begin decreasing prenatally at that time, then decrease rapidly after birth. Normal adult levels in the newborn are usually reached by the age of 8 to 12 months. While the function in humans is unknown, in rodents it binds estradiol to prevent the transport of this hormone across the placenta to the fetus. The main function of this is to prevent the virilization of female fetuses. As human AFP does not bind estrogen, its function in humans is less clear. In human liver cancer, AFP is found to bind glypican-3 (GPC3), another oncofetal antigen. 

The rodent AFP system can be overridden with massive injections of estrogen, which overwhelm the AFP system and will masculinize the fetus. The masculinizing effect of estrogens may seem counter-intuitive since estrogens are critical for the proper development of female secondary characteristics during puberty. However, this is not the case prenatally. Gonadal hormones from the testes, such as testosterone and anti-M√ºllerian hormone, are required to cause development of a phenotypic male. Without these hormones, the fetus will develop into a phenotypic female even if genetically XY. The conversion of testosterone into estradiol by aromatase in many tissues may be an important step in masculinization of that tissue. Masculinization of the brain is thought to occur both by conversion of testosterone into estradiol by aromatase, but also by de novo synthesis of estrogens within the brain. Thus, AFP may protect the fetus from maternal estradiol that would otherwise have a masculinizing effect on the fetus, but its exact role is still controversial.

== Serum levels ==
=== Maternal ===

In pregnant women, fetal AFP levels can be monitored in the urine of the pregnant woman. Since AFP is quickly cleared from the mother&#x27;s serum via her kidneys, maternal urine AFP correlates with fetal serum levels, although the maternal urine level is much lower than the fetal serum level. AFP levels rise until about week 32. Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) screening is performed at 16 to 18 weeks of gestation. If MSAFP levels indicate an anomaly, amniocentesis may be offered to the patient.

=== Infants ===

The normal range of AFP for adults and children is variously reported as under 50, under 10, or under 5¬†ng/mL. At birth, normal infants have AFP levels four or more orders of magnitude above this normal range, that decreases to a normal range over the first year of life.

During this time, the normal range of AFP levels spans approximately two orders of magnitude. Correct evaluation of &quot;abnormal&quot; AFP levels in infants must take into account these normal patterns.

Very high AFP levels may be subject to hooking (see Tumor marker), which results in the level being reported significantly lower than the actual concentration. This is important for analysis of a series of AFP tumor marker tests, e.g. in the context of post-treatment early surveillance of cancer survivors, where the rate of decrease of AFP has diagnostic value.

== Clinical significance ==

Measurement of AFP is generally used in two clinical contexts. First, it is measured in pregnant women through the analysis of maternal blood or amniotic fluid as a screening test for certain developmental abnormalities, such as aneuploidy. Second, serum AFP level is elevated in people with certain tumors, and so it is used as a biomarker to follow these diseases. Some of these diseases are listed below:
* &quot;Developmental birth defects associated with elevated AFP&quot;
**Omphalocele
**Gastroschisis
** Neural tube defects: ‚Üë Œ±-fetoprotein in amniotic fluid and maternal serum 
* &quot;Tumors associated with elevated AFP&quot;
** Hepatocellular carcinoma
** Metastatic disease affecting the liver
** Nonseminomatous germ cell tumors
** Yolk sac tumor
* &quot;Other conditions associated with elevated AFP&quot;
** Ataxia telangiectasia: elevated AFP is used as one factor in diagnosis

A peptide derived from AFP that is referred to as AFPep is claimed to possess anti-cancer properties.

In the treatment of testicular cancer it is paramount to differentiate seminomatous and nonseminomatous tumors. This is typically done pathologically after removal of the testicle and confirmed by tumor markers. However, if the pathology is pure seminoma, if the AFP is elevated, the tumor is treated as a nonseminomatous tumor because it contains yolk sac (nonseminomatous) components.

<text>Dinosaur Jr. is an American rock band formed in Amherst, Massachusetts, in 1984. Originally called Dinosaur, the band was forced to change their name because of legal issues.

The band was founded by J Mascis (guitar, vocals, primary songwriter), Lou Barlow (bass, vocals), and Murph (drums). After three albums on independent labels, the band earned a reputation as one of the formative influences on American alternative rock. Creative tension led to Mascis firing Barlow, who later formed Sebadoh and Folk Implosion. His replacement, Mike Johnson, came aboard for three major-label albums. Murph eventually quit, with Mascis taking over drums on the band&#x27;s albums before the group disbanded in 1997. The original lineup reformed in 2005, releasing five albums thereafter.

Mascis&#x27;s drawling vocals and distinct guitar sound, harking back to 1960s and 1970s classic rock and characterized by extensive use of feedback and distortion, were highly influential in the alternative rock movement of the 1990s.

==History==
===Formation===
Mascis and Barlow played together, on drums and guitar respectively, in the hardcore punk band Deep Wound, formed in 1982 while the pair were attending high school in western Massachusetts. After high school, they began exploring slower yet still aggressive music like Black Sabbath, the Replacements, and Neil Young. Mascis&#x27;s college friend Gerard Cosloy introduced him to psychedelic-influenced pop bands like Dream Syndicate, which Mascis in turn showed to Barlow. Barlow explained, &quot;We loved speed metal¬†... and we loved wimpy-jangly stuff&quot;.

Deep Wound broke up in mid-1984. Cosloy had dropped out of the University of Massachusetts Amherst to focus on running his independent record label, Homestead Records. He promised Mascis that if he were to make a record, Homestead would release it. Mascis wrote a number of songs by himself and showed them to Barlow, to whom he offered the bassist position. Barlow described the songs as &quot;...fucking brilliant...They were so far beyond. I was still into two-chord songs and basic stuff like &#x27;I&#x27;m so sad.&#x27; While I was really into my own little tragedy, J was operating in this whole other panorama.&quot; Mascis enlisted vocalist Charlie Nakajima, also formerly of Deep Wound, and drummer Emmett Patrick Murphy (otherwise known as Murph) to complete the band. Mascis explained the concept behind the group as &quot;ear-bleeding country.&quot;

The band was initially named Mogo, and they played their first show on the University of Massachusetts Amherst campus in the first week of September 1984. However, Nakajima used the performance to launch an extended anti-police tirade. Mascis was so appalled by Nakajima&#x27;s behavior at the show that he disbanded the group the next day. A few days later, Mascis invited Barlow and Murph to form a new band without telling Nakajima. &quot;I was kind of like too wimpy to kick him out, exactly,&quot; Mascis later admitted. &quot;Communicating with people has been a constant problem in the band.&quot; The trio named themselves Dinosaur, and Mascis and Barlow took over lead vocal duties.

===&quot;Dinosaur&quot;===
Mascis took Cosloy up on his offer to release an album on Homestead, and Dinosaur recorded their debut album for $500 at a home studio in the woods outside Northampton, Massachusetts. Their debut album &quot;Dinosaur&quot; was released in 1985, for which Mascis wrote all of the songs. The vocals were done by Mascis in his trademark nasal drawl, which was often compared to singer Neil Young. Mascis would sing most or all of the lead vocals on all of their subsequent releases. The album did not make much of an impact commercially or critically. It sold only about 1,500 copies in its first year and was largely ignored by the majority of the music press.

After the record&#x27;s release, Dinosaur would often drive to New York City to perform shows. The New York-based alternative rock band Sonic Youth was unimpressed by the first Dinosaur performance they saw, but after watching them play several months later, they approached the band declaring themselves fans. Sonic Youth invited Dinosaur to join them on tour in the American Northeast and northern Midwest in September 1986.
Dinosaur recorded much of their second album, &quot;&quot;, with Sonic Youth engineer Wharton Tiers in New York. During the recording process, tension emerged between Mascis and Murph due to Mascis&#x27; very specific ideas for the drum parts. Barlow recalled, &quot;J controlled Murph&#x27;s every drumbeat¬†... And Murph could not handle that. Murph wanted to kill J for the longest time.&quot; Gerard Cosloy was excited by the completed album, but was devastated when Mascis told him the band was going to release it on California-based SST Records. Mascis was reluctant to sign a two-album deal with Homestead, which Cosloy felt betrayed by, &quot;There was &quot;no way&quot; I couldn&#x27;t take it personally.&quot; After the album&#x27;s completion, Mascis moved to New York, leaving the rest of the band feeling alienated.

&quot;&quot; was released in 1987; early copies of the record in the Boston area were packaged with the &quot;Weed Forestin&#x27;&quot; tape, the first release by Barlow&#x27;s side project Sebadoh. The album received much more attention in the indie-rock community than the debut. Barlow also composed two songs: the hardcore-influenced &quot;Lose&quot; and an acoustic song entitled &quot;Poledo&quot; that anticipated his work with Sebadoh.

=== Name change ===
Immediately following the release of &quot;&quot;, a supergroup called Dinosaurs (featuring ex-members of Country Joe and the Fish, Quicksilver Messenger Service, Hot Tuna, the Grateful Dead, and Jefferson Airplane) sued Dinosaur over the use of the name, prompting the addition of &quot;Jr.&quot;

===&quot;Bug&quot; and Barlow&#x27;s departure===
Dinosaur Jr. had a significant breakthrough in the United Kingdom with their debut single for &quot;Blast First&quot;, &quot;Freak Scene&quot;, in 1988. A version with censored lyrics was issued for radio use, reaching number 4 in the UK independent chart. It stayed on the chart for 12 weeks. The band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Bug&quot;, followed shortly afterwards, reaching number 1 on the UK independent chart and spending 38 weeks on the chart. The band&#x27;s first UK singles chart placing came in 1989 with their cover of The Cure&#x27;s &quot;Just Like Heaven&quot;.

&quot;Bug&quot; was similar in musical style to &quot;&quot;, with contrasting distorted instruments and the melodic vocals, as was the band&#x27;s unique blend of musical influences. However, &quot;Bug&quot; was considered to be more melodic, accompanied by more conventional song structures. Barlow&#x27;s only lead vocal was on the album&#x27;s final track, featuring an overdriven, noise-rock backing track and Barlow screaming &quot;Why don&#x27;t you like me?&quot; Mascis took lead vocals on all the other tracks and exhibited even tighter control over the band&#x27;s sound, composing the parts for Murph and Barlow to play. Yet, he has described &quot;Bug&quot; as his least favorite of the band&#x27;s albums, saying in a 2005 interview, &quot;I like some of the songs but, I dunno, I guess I really don&#x27;t like the vibe of it.&quot;

Despite the album&#x27;s success, tension between Mascis and Barlow began interfering with the band&#x27;s productivity. In 1989, after touring in support of &quot;Bug&quot;, Barlow was kicked out of the band. Barlow focused his attention on his former side-project Sebadoh. &quot;The Freed Pig&quot;, the opening track on 1991&#x27;s &quot;Sebadoh III&quot;, documents Barlow&#x27;s frustration with Mascis and feeling of being treated poorly in Dinosaur Jr.

Meanwhile, the band embarked on an Australian tour with Donna Dresch filling in for Barlow. In 1990, the band released a new single,&quot;The Wagon&quot;, on Sub Pop, their first release since Barlow&#x27;s departure. The single featured a short-lived lineup including guitarist Don Fleming and drummer Jay Spiegel from the band Gumball, in addition to Mascis and Murph.

===Major label years===
Despite the ongoing turmoil in their lineup, Dinosaur Jr. signed with Sire Records in 1990, and made their major-label debut with &quot;Green Mind&quot; in 1991. This record heavily featured Mascis, with Murph playing drums on only a few songs, as well as minimal contributions from Fleming and Spiegel, who were out of the band by the time the album was released. Mascis recorded many of the drum parts by himself and layered the various instrumental parts through overdubbing.

For touring purposes, Mascis first added Van Conner, and then Mike Johnson on bass. Together they embarked on several tours to support &quot;Green Mind&quot;, with support acts that included Nirvana. In 1991, Sire Records released an EP titled &quot;Whatever&#x27;s Cool with Me&quot; that featured old B-sides coupled with one new track. In 1992, the band was part of the Rollercoaster Tour, a package tour based on the successful Lollapolooza festival, which featured The Jesus and Mary Chain, My Bloody Valentine, and Blur.

The band found their live shows well received in the changing musical climate of the early 1990s and decided to record new material with the new lineup. This time, the recording sessions included full participation from Murph and Johnson, with the former playing most of the drums and the latter playing all of the bass parts, singing harmony vocals, and even contributing a few guitar solos. This material represented the peak of the band&#x27;s commercial success, with the single &quot;Start Choppin&quot;&#x27; reaching the top 20 in the UK, and the album that followed, &quot;Where You Been&quot;, reaching the UK top 10 and the US top 50. The opening track, &quot;Out There&quot;, had an accompanying video and was aired on MTV for a short time on the show &quot;120 Minutes&quot;. Although their new material was more accessible than the band&#x27;s 1980s albums, in terms of playing, it represented a partial return to the more unrestrained power-trio sound of the original lineup.

Murph left the band after touring for &quot;Where You Been&quot; and was replaced for the band&#x27;s live shows by George Berz, leaving Mascis as the sole remaining original member. However, the band&#x27;s subsequent albums would be recorded mostly by Mascis on his own, playing everything except for the bass and some of the harmony vocals, which continued to be handled by Mike Johnson. The commercial success continued with 1994&#x27;s &quot;Without a Sound&quot;, which placed well in both the US and UK album charts. After 1997&#x27;s &quot;Hand It Over&quot;, Mascis finally retired the Dinosaur Jr. name, with the group&#x27;s final live performance being an appearance on the American talk show &quot;The Jenny Jones Show&quot;. In 2000, Mascis released the first of two solo albums under the name J Mascis + The Fog.

===2005 reunion and onward===
Mascis and Barlow began to reconcile when Mascis began showing up at Sebadoh shows. &quot;I think he was kind of aware of how much shit I was talking about him,&quot; Barlow noted in a 2005 interview, &quot;but I don&#x27;t think he really ever pursued any of it. One of the things that really triggered this, for me to finally just go, &#x27;Hey, you know, maybe this could work,&#x27; is when I realized that maybe J wasn&#x27;t really holding any kind of grudge against me because he didn&#x27;t like me. I was thinking, maybe he just didn&#x27;t realize what he had done, or maybe he wasn&#x27;t really aware of how much he&#x27;d actually hurt me. And when I started to realize that, he kind of became more human to me.&quot;

In 2002, the two shared the stage for two shows in London, with Barlow singing &quot;I Wanna Be Your Dog&quot; along with Mascis, Ron Asheton, Scott Asheton and Mike Watt, who had been performing Stooges songs as &quot;Asheton, Asheton, Mascis and Watt&quot;.

Mascis regained the master rights to the band&#x27;s first three albums from SST in 2004 and arranged for their reissue on Merge in early 2005. Later that year, he and Barlow shared the stage at a benefit show for autism at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts organized by Barlow&#x27;s mother, and played together as Deep Wound after Mascis and Sebadoh had completed their respective sets.

Following the reissues in 2005, Mascis, Barlow, and Murph finally reunited to play on &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot; on April 15, 2005. In June that year, they kicked off a tour of Europe. While performing in New York City in 2006, much of the band&#x27;s equipment was stolen while stored outside their hotel. The band members were later among the curators of 2006&#x27;s All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival.

In 2007, the original members of Dinosaur Jr. released &quot;Beyond&quot; on Fat Possum Records, their first album of new material as a trio since &quot;Bug&quot; in 1988. It was met with critical acclaim, receiving an 8.4 rating from Pitchfork Media and garnering positive reviews from the music press as a whole. It was considered somewhat of a sonic paradox in that even though it featured the original members who produced &quot;two records so drenched in noise they still sound like aural assaults decades after their original release,&quot; sonically it resembled the major label releases of the 1990s in both production values and stylistic range. On the other hand, while the sound was not as extreme as the original lineup&#x27;s 1980s albums, it did feature a bigger, more unrestrained, and more live-sounding feel than their 1990s albums, though Barlow&#x27;s bass was noticeably quieter. Barlow made his mark on the music in other ways; for the first time since &quot;&quot;, he contributed to the songwriting. The album went on to have good commercial success, debuting on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number 69 its opening week.

In February 2009, the band signed with indie label Jagjaguwar. The band&#x27;s first release on the new label was an album titled &quot;Farm&quot; which was released on June 23, 2009. Murph said the album was recorded at Mascis&#x27;s home and marks return to the heavier, &quot;Where You Been&quot; LP era. The album reached number 29 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, making it the band&#x27;s highest-charting album in the US. To promote the album, the band played &quot;Farm&#x27;&quot;s lead-off track, &quot;Pieces&quot;, on &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot; on June 25, 2009.

Dinosaur Jr. released their second album for Jagjaguwar, &quot;I Bet on Sky, &quot;in September 2012, to favourable reviews.

In December 2015, Murph confirmed the band had entered the studio to begin working on their follow up to &quot;I Bet on Sky&quot;. The album &quot;Give a Glimpse of What Yer Not&quot; was released on August 5, 2016, on Jagjaguwar.

In February 2019, the song &quot;Over Your Shoulder&quot; from the band&#x27;s 1994 album &quot;Without a Sound&quot; reached number 18 on Japan&#x27;s &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. The cause is suspected to be the song&#x27;s use on the Japanese TV show called &quot;Gachinko Fight Club&quot;.

In February 2021, the band announced their 12th album &quot;Sweep It Into Space&quot;, which was released on April 23, 2021. The album was originally scheduled for release in mid-2020 but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The album was preceded by the single &quot;I Ran Away&quot; on February 23, 2021, with a music video for the song being released on March 3, 2021. The second single, &quot;Garden&quot;, was released with a music video on March 31, 2021. The band announced a 2021 North American tour to support the album was planned to begin in September 2021 and would conclude in February 2022.

==Musical style and influences==
Dinosaur Jr. has been described as alternative rock indie rock, noise rock, hardcore punk (early albums) and grunge (early 1990s).

Dinosaur Jr. is considered to be an alternative rock band; however, the band&#x27;s musical style, compared to its underground contemporaries in the 1980s, differed in several ways. This included the influence of classic rock on the band&#x27;s music, their use of feedback, extreme volume as well as loud-quiet dynamic, combined with Mascis&#x27;s droning vocals. A characteristic of Mascis&#x27;s vocal style is frequent use of vocal fry. Gerald Cosloy, head of Homestead Records, summarized the band&#x27;s music: &quot;It was its own bizarre hybrid. ... It wasn&#x27;t exactly pop, it wasn&#x27;t exactly punk rock‚Äîit was completely its own thing&quot;.

Lou Barlow has described the Phoenix, Arizona band Meat Puppets as &quot;the singularly most influential band on both Dinosaur Jr. and Sebadoh.&quot; The band has also highlighted the influence of Neil Young, Black Sabbath, the Birthday Party, Scratch Acid, Sonic Youth, Green on Red, the Dream Syndicate, and Throbbing Gristle.

Mascis listened to classic rock artists such as the Rolling Stones and the Beach Boys, elements of which were incorporated into Dinosaur Jr.&#x27;s sound. In addition, Mascis was also a fan of many punk and hardcore bands such as The Birthday Party, and has frequently noted Nick Cave as an influence. Dinosaur Jr. combined elements of hardcore punk and noise rock into their songs, which often featured a large amount of feedback, distortion and extreme volume. When the master tape of &quot;&quot; arrived at SST, the label&#x27;s production manager noticed the level on the tape was so high it was distorting; however, Mascis confirmed it was the way he wanted the album to sound.

Similar to Mascis&#x27;s guitar work, Barlow&#x27;s bass lines with their alternating heavily distorted, fast chords and pulverizing lows, draw heavily from both his hardcore past and musicians such as Lemmy and Johnny Ramone. On his influences, Barlow stated that &quot;...Johnny Ramone is my hero. I wanted to make that rhythmic chugging sound like he got playing guitar with the Ramones. And, I found that I got a bigger sound by strumming farther up the neck.&quot;

Mascis&#x27;s vocals are another distinctive feature of Dinosaur Jr.&#x27;s music. He attributed his &quot;whiny low-key drawl&quot;, the opposite of the hardcore punk &quot;bark&quot;, to artists such as John Fogerty and Mick Jagger. His style also resembled Neil Young&#x27;s, but Mascis disputed this and later commented: &quot;That got annoying, being compared all the time.&quot; His drawl epitomized the band&#x27;s slacker ethos and relaxed attitude; author Michael Azerrad said &quot;even Mascis seemed removed from the feelings he was conveying in the music.&quot;

==Legacy==
In a BBC review of their reissued albums &quot;&quot; and &quot;Bug&quot;, Zoe Street called them &quot;Frighteningly ahead of their time.&quot; &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; called them &quot;one of post-punk‚Äôs most influential bands.&quot; According to Michael Azerrad:Dinosaur Jr was one of the first, biggest, and best bands among the second generation of indie kids, the ones who took Black Flag and Minor Threat for granted, a generation for whom the Seventies, not the Sixties, was the nostalgic ideal. Their music continued a retrograde stylistic shift in the American underground that the Replacements and other bands had begun: renouncing the antihistorical tendencies of hardcore and fully embracing the music that everyone had grown up on. In particular, Dinosaur singer-guitarist J Mascis achieved the unthinkable in underground rock‚Äîhe brought back the extended guitar solo.Dinosaur Jr.&#x27;s music has influenced many other musicians such as Kurt Cobain of Nirvana, Billy Corgan of The Smashing Pumpkins, Radiohead, Slowdive, Mudhoney, Tad, Superchunk, Doug Martsch of Built to Spill, Kevin Shields of My Bloody Valentine, Ride, Aidan Moffat of Arab Strap, Swervedriver, Uncle Tupelo, Evan Dando of The Lemonheads, Tom DeLonge of Blink-182, Band of Horses, and Kurt Vile.

Their album &quot;&quot; has been called &quot;the first perfect indie rock album.&quot; &quot;Spin&quot; named it one of &quot;The 300 Best Albums of the Past 30 Years (1985‚Äì2014)&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; placed the album at number 40 on its Top 100 Albums of the 1980s list.

<text>IQ are a British neo-prog band founded by Mike Holmes and Martin Orford in 1981 following the dissolution of their original band The Lens.

Although the band have never enjoyed major commercial success and had several lineup changes, IQ have built up a loyal following over the years and are still active as of 2024, currently with the original recording line-up (with the exception of Orford).

In 2021/22, IQ performed a series of concerts in the UK and Europe celebrating their 40th anniversary.

==Neo-progressive movement==
IQ were one of a number of British bands formed during the early 1980s, including Marillion, Pendragon, Twelfth Night, Pallas and Solstice, that continued with the progressive rock style forsaken by 1970s bands such as Genesis and Yes. The music press have subsequently coined the phrase neo-progressive to describe these bands (although this term was never used contemporaneously with the movement as described in Martin Orford&#x27;s essay referenced below), often accusing them of simply copying the styles of other bands. This accusation has been strenuously denied by Martin Orford, who is against the use of the term &quot;neo progressive&quot; and claims the band have wide-ranging and eclectic selection of musical influences. Paul Stump&#x27;s &quot;History of Progressive Rock&quot;, while affirming the band&#x27;s categorization as neo-progressive, argued that IQ &quot;did at least offer a more individual palette which, while just as derivative [as Marillion] in its way, gave the impression that the choice of arrangements was indivisible from the choice of notes played - that the similarities with older bands arose &quot;accidentally&quot; from their own personal approach to music.&quot; [emphasis in original]

==Line-up==
From 1982, the line-up consisted of Peter Nicholls (vocals), Mike Holmes (guitar), Martin Orford (keyboards), Paul Cook (not to be confused with the Sex Pistols&#x27; drummer of the same name) (drums), and Tim Esau (bass). Nicholls left in July 1985 to form a new band, Niadem&#x27;s Ghost, and was replaced by Paul (P. L.) Menel, but subsequently returned in 1990. Nicholls also created the cover art for most of the albums on which he appears. In early 2005, member Paul Cook left the band and was replaced on drums by Andy Edwards (ex Robert Plant drummer). On 20 July 2007, Martin Orford announced that he was leaving IQ and he was replaced by Mark Westworth from prog-rock band Darwin&#x27;s Radio. As of late 2009, Paul Cook has returned to replace Andy Edwards. On 7 October 2010, Mark Westworth announced on the band&#x27;s official web site that he would be leaving the band and his final appearance with IQ was on 11 December 2010. On 1 January 2011, the band announced that Westworth&#x27;s replacement on keyboards would be Neil Durant, from instrumental prog-fusion band Sphere¬≥. On 7 January 2011, bassist of 19 years John Jowitt announced on the band&#x27;s website that he had left the band, and that his last appearance with the band had also been the concert on 11 December 2010. He was replaced by original bassist Tim Esau in January 2011.

==Musical style==

The band&#x27;s musical style, especially earlier in their career, was reminiscent of Peter Gabriel and Steve Hackett era Genesis because of singer Peter Nicholls&#x27; vocal and stage-presence similarities to Gabriel and keyboardist Martin Orford&#x27;s grandiose keyboarding. However, guitarist Mike Holmes&#x27; role was far more assertive in the band, giving them a harder edge musically. After Nicholls&#x27; departure, the band&#x27;s style became increasingly commercial and radio-friendly ‚Äî albeit without much success ‚Äî on &quot;Nomzamo&quot; (1987) and &quot;Are You Sitting Comfortably?&quot; (1989), although each album still featured some progressive rock-style tracks. Beginning with the return of Nicholls on 1993&#x27;s &quot;Ever&quot;, the band returned to its prog rock roots, with longer tracks featuring intricate arrangements and complex musicianship.

<doc id="238722" wikidata="Q221443" url="?curid=238722" title="Vivid (Living Colour album)">
<text>Vivid is the debut studio album by American rock band Living Colour, released on May 2, 1988, by Epic Records. It was one of the most popular albums of 1988, peaking at number six on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and being certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

==Musical style==
Musically, &quot;Vivid&quot; has been described as a hard rock, heavy metal, funk metal, alternative metal, and funk rock album, with elements of soul, jazz, pop, rap, arena rock, punk, and avant-garde jazz.

==Critical reception==
In &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;, Ken Tucker commented that Living Colour &quot;defies musical stereotypes by evincing influences that include Lynyrd Skynyrd, Jimi Hendrix, Roxy Music and Sly Stone to yield a fierce, funny album.&quot; Mark Sinker of &quot;NME&quot; likewise highlighted the band&#x27;s diversity of influences, including their embrace of older musical styles &quot;that even metal heads haven&#x27;t taken seriously&quot;, and concluded that &quot;Vivid&quot; &quot;lives up, simultaneously, to the pinhead directness of Zeppelin and the total Texas-New Yorker strangeness of Ornette Coleman&#x27;s Prime Time.&quot; &quot;In its own way,&quot; wrote &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic David Fricke, &quot;&quot;Vivid&quot; is an open letter to rock &amp; roll itself, a demand for equal time and respect from a music that is Living Colour&#x27;s birthright.&quot; He added that the album &quot;will not change the world single-handedly, but it&#x27;s a timely reminder of why it&#x27;s always worth trying.&quot; Robert Christgau was less enthusiastic in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, finding that &quot;while it&#x27;s momentarily exhilarating to hear this all-black band come power-chording out of the box, after a while the fancy arrangements and strained soul remind me of, I don&#x27;t know, Megadeth.&quot; The album came in at #15 on the 1988 top-25 &#x27;albums of the year list&#x27; in &quot;Kerrang!&quot;.

Among retrospective appraisals, AllMusic reviewer Greg Prato deemed &quot;Vivid&quot; &quot;one of the finest hard rock albums of the &#x27;80s ‚Äì and for that matter, all time.&quot; In &quot;Blender&quot;, Michael Azerrad recalled that the notion of &quot;four black musicians playing heavy metal&quot; made &quot;Vivid&quot; &quot;newsworthy&quot;, while adding that as &quot;the black-rock trend never panned out&quot;, years after the album&#x27;s release Living Colour&#x27;s chief legacy lies in its music, noting &quot;Vivid&quot;‚Ä≥s &quot;landmark&quot; fusion of &quot;hardcore, funk and avant-jazz.&quot; J. D. Considine, writing for the 2004 edition of &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, was most impressed by how Living Colour &quot;backs its musical vision with insight, offering pointed, perceptive social commentary through songs such as &#x27;Funny Vibe&#x27; and &#x27;Open Letter (To a Landlord).&#x27;&quot; Calling &quot;Vivid&quot; &quot;a crucial document in Black rock music&quot;, &quot;Pitchfork&quot;‚Ä≥s Stuart Berman opined that the album&#x27;s legacy endures through later artists who have &quot;flowed through the cracks in the industry barriers that¬†&quot;Vivid&quot; breached, and, in their own unique ways, have each inherited the mission of reclaiming Black creators&#x27; frontline position at rock&#x27;s vanguard, both under- and above-ground.&quot; &quot;Vivid&quot; is featured in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<doc id="238723" wikidata="Q683079" url="?curid=238723" title="Violator (album)">
<text>Violator is the seventh studio album by English electronic music band Depeche Mode. It was first released on 19 March 1990 by Mute Records internationally and by Sire and Reprise Records in the United States.

Preceded by the singles &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; and &quot;Enjoy the Silence&quot; (a top-10 entry in both the United Kingdom and the United States), the album propelled the band into international stardom, and also yielded the singles &quot;Policy of Truth&quot; and &quot;World in My Eyes&quot;. &quot;Violator&quot; reached number two on the UK Albums Chart, and was the band&#x27;s first album to chart inside the top 10 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, peaking at number seven. The album was supported by the World Violation Tour.

==Background==
Depeche Mode had supported their previous album, &quot;Music for the Masses&quot; (1987), with the Music for the Masses Tour, which ran from late 1987 through mid-1988, which itself was supported by the live release &quot;101&quot;, released in March 1989. A few months later, Martin Gore released his first solo album, &quot;Counterfeit EP&quot;. By the middle of 1989, the full band was recording together, and they released the single &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; in August, a full 7 months before the album itself.

==Recording==
&quot;Violator&quot; was recorded in 1989 in Milan, Italy, and Denmark. On the album, Depeche Mode worked with Flood as producer for the first time, and Fran√ßois Kevorkian was responsible for the sound mix. Compared to previous albums, the band decided to try a new approach to recording. Alan Wilder said, &quot;Usually we begin the making of a record by having extensive pre-production meetings where we decide what the record will actually sound like, then go into a programming studio. This time we decided to keep all pre-production work to a minimum. We were beginning to have a problem with boredom in that we felt we&#x27;d reached a certain level of achievement in doing things a certain way.&quot; Martin Gore elaborated, &quot;Over the last five years I think we&#x27;d perfected a formula; my demos, a month in a programming studio, etc. etc. We decided that our first record of the &#x27;90s ought to be different.&quot;

With co-producer Flood, Wilder began a complementary working relationship, with Flood able to provide the technical know-how and Wilder working on the arrangements and song textures. &quot;That&#x27;s how we made the group work at that time&quot;, clarified Wilder, &quot;by accepting that we all had different roles and not actually all trying to do the same thing. So we ended up with this unwritten agreement in the band, where we&#x27;d all throw together a few ideas at the beginning of a track. Then Fletch and Mart would go away, and they&#x27;d come back after we&#x27;d worked on it for a while to give an opinion.&quot;

There was also a notable change in Gore&#x27;s demos. After the rigid, limiting effects of almost-finished demos for &quot;Music for the Masses&quot;, Gore, agreeing to Wilder&#x27;s request, kept them less complete this time around. Several of the basic recordings consisted of vocals over a simple guitar or organ part, with the odd percussion loop, but less sequenced material. The sparse demos allowed the band to take creative liberties with the songs. For instance, &quot;Enjoy the Silence&quot; started out as a slow ballad, but at Wilder&#x27;s suggestion became a pulsating, up-tempo track.

The band convened to work on the record with Flood at Mute&#x27;s WorldWide programming room in London for three weeks after which they flew to Milan for the new sessions at Logic studios. According to Flood, they did not do a substantial amount of work in Milan, except for the song &quot;Personal Jesus&quot;, which was crucial in setting the tone and spirit of the album. &quot;Everybody was feeling each other out, because they wanted to try working in a different way. The idea was to work hard and party hard and we all enjoyed ourselves to the full.&quot; After Milan the band relocated to Puk studios in northern Denmark, where most of the album was recorded.

==Composition==
Musically, &quot;Violator&quot; has been described as synth-pop, electropop, alternative rock, dance, and gothic rock. Gore called the track &quot;World in My Eyes&quot; a very positive song: &quot;It&#x27;s saying that love and sex and pleasure are positive things.&quot; The song &quot;Blue Dress&quot;, which Gore called &quot;pervy&quot;, is simply about &quot;watching a girl dress and realising that this is &#x27;what makes the world turn.&#x27;&quot; With &quot;Halo&quot;, Gore said, &quot;I&#x27;m saying &#x27;let&#x27;s give in to this&#x27; but there&#x27;s also a real feeling of wrongfulness [...] I suppose my songs do seem to advocate immorality but if you listen there&#x27;s always a sense of guilt.&quot; The closing track, &quot;Clean&quot;, was inspired by Pink Floyd&#x27;s song &quot;One of These Days&quot;, from their 1971 album &quot;Meddle&quot;. Said Wilder, &quot;they [Pink Floyd] were doing something very different to anyone else at that time ‚Äì you can hear electronics in there, and the influence of classical music. It&#x27;s got a very repetitive, synthesised sound, and the bass riffs with the echo have a very hypnotic groove that underpins it. We basically nicked that idea [for &#x27;Clean&#x27;]&quot;.

Regarding the album&#x27;s title, Gore said, &quot;We called it &quot;Violator&quot; as a joke. We wanted to come up with the most extreme, ridiculously Heavy Metal title that we could. I&#x27;ll be surprised if people will get the joke.&quot;

==Reception==
===Critical===
In a contemporary review for &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, music critic Paul Lester called &quot;Violator&quot; &quot;Depeche Mode&#x27;s most arresting work to date.&quot; Tim Nicholson of &quot;Record Mirror&quot; was enthused by the stripped-down quality of the songs and called the album a &quot;compromise between pop music and something a little more sinister&quot;, adding: &quot;There are no noises out of place in this perfectly formed void.&quot; Ian Cranna of &quot;Q&quot; found the music subtly clever and deemed &quot;Violator&quot; &quot;a fine record which may not set the world on fire but deserves to singe it a bit.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; writer Helen Mead felt that the album &quot;seems almost a step back, in that it&#x27;s cleaner, sparser, more clinical&quot; than &quot;Music for the Masses&quot;, but concluded that &quot;there is security in the knowledge that everything is very clear cut in Depeche Mode&#x27;s blue and white world.&quot;

In a less enthusiastic review, Robert Christgau said that Depeche Mode conceded to fickle teenage demographics on &quot;Violator&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s Chuck Eddy said that, despite the album&#x27;s &quot;ambient charm&quot;, Gahan sounds &quot;slimy and self-involved&quot;, and in their attempt to make listeners dance, Depeche Mode &quot;revert to morose pop psychology and then never tell you how come they&#x27;re so sad.&quot; For &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Greg Sandow wrote that the songs &quot;hint at unspecified meanings, in a mannered way that might well be called pompous&quot;.

Among retrospective appraisals, AllMusic critic Ned Raggett viewed &quot;Violator&quot; as &quot;song for song... simply the best, most consistent effort yet from the band&quot;, while &quot;Blender&quot;‚Ä≥s Dennis Lim deemed it Depeche Mode&#x27;s &quot;career peak&quot; and &quot;justifiably their biggest critical and commercial success&quot;. Barry Walters of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; identified the album as one of the &quot;key stages in the band&#x27;s evolution&quot;, citing its emphasis on &quot;heavier hooks, cinematic arrangements and sleek sonic detail.&quot; In &quot;Mojo&quot;, Danny Eccleston wrote that &quot;Violator&quot; found Depeche Mode merging &quot;European and US paradigms much as U2 had done in the mid-&#x27;80s&quot;, transforming them &quot;from an arena-level electro-pop unit into a global stadium rock band&quot;. Writing for &quot;Q&quot;, John Aizlewood singled out Flood&#x27;s production on the album for praise, saying that the resulting &quot;warmth&quot; of the music &quot;has helped &quot;Violator&quot; to age with consummate grace.&quot; Sal Cinquemani of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; called the album &quot;a quintessential benchmark of pop, rock, and electronic music&quot;.

&quot;Violator&quot; was ranked number 57 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;‚Ä≥s 2010 list of the 100 best albums of the 1990s. It was ranked number 342 on the 2003 and 2012 editions of the magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and number 167 on the list&#x27;s 2020 edition. &quot;Violator&quot; has also featured on lists of the greatest albums of all time made by publications such as &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;Spin&quot;, and is included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

===Commercial===
As a sign of their rising popularity when &quot;Violator&quot; was released, a signing party for fans at a Wherehouse record store in Los Angeles that was expected to draw only a few thousand fans ended up drawing around 17,000. The band were forced to withdraw from the event due to security concerns, and their early exit nearly caused a riot. &quot;Violator&quot; reached number 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200-year-end chart of 1990, and was the first Depeche Mode album to sell a million copies in the United States.

The success of &quot;Violator&quot; introduced the band to a wider audience, and this increased exposure led to their 1993 follow-up album &quot;Songs of Faith and Devotion&quot; debuting at the top of the charts in both the United States and United Kingdom. &quot;Before this, we&#x27;d been going along quite nicely,&quot; recalled Andy Fletcher. &quot;Then when it came to &quot;Violator&quot; we inexplicably went huge. It was just incredible, and in many ways we never really recovered from that. After that, we just felt like we wanted to muck it up a bit.&quot;

==Re-release==

As part of Mute&#x27;s 2006 reissue schedule, &quot;Violator&quot; was re-released as a hybrid Super Audio CD + DVD-Video package on 3 April 2006 that included two-channel and 5.1 surround mixes of the album. The six B-sides to the &quot;Violator&quot; singles‚Äî&quot;Dangerous&quot;, &quot;Memphisto&quot;, &quot;Sibeling&quot;, &quot;Kaleid&quot;, &quot;Happiest Girl&quot;, and &quot;Sea of Sin&quot;‚Äîalso appear, albeit without the surround sound treatment. The reissue did not reach the US until 6 June 2006. The US version lacked the hybrid SACD and instead included a separate CD and DVD. The DVD was identical to the European DVD but in NTSC format instead of PAL. The lack of SACD is due to the titles being distributed in North America by Warner, who do not support the SACD format.

A 32-minute short film, titled &quot;Depeche Mode 1989‚Äì90 (If You Wanna Use Guitars, Use Guitars)&quot;, featured interviews with the band, Daniel Miller, Flood, Fran√ßois Kevorkian (who mixed the album), Anton Corbijn (who directed the music videos and did the album&#x27;s photography/cover), and others. It also includes news footage from the infamous &quot;riot&quot; in Los Angeles, which gave the band media publicity the day before &quot;Violator&quot; came out. The band were scheduled to do autographs in an LA music store, and the line became extremely long, stretching towards twenty-thousand people, and the event had to be cancelled shortly after it began due to problems keeping them in order. There is also footage from &quot;Strange Too&quot;, notably clips from the music videos for &quot;Halo&quot; and &quot;Clean&quot;.

The remastered album was released on &quot;deluxe&quot; vinyl on 2 March 2007 in Germany and on 5 March 2007 internationally.

<doc id="238724" wikidata="Q259346" url="?curid=238724" title="Sputum">
<text>Sputum is mucus that is coughed up from the lower airways (the trachea and bronchi). In medicine, sputum samples are usually used for a naked eye examination, microbiological investigation of respiratory infections and cytological investigations of respiratory systems.

A naked eye exam of the sputum can be done at home by a patient in order to note the various colors (see below). Any hint of yellow or green color (pus) suggests an airway infection (but does not indicate the type of organism causing it). Such color hints are best detected when the sputum is viewed on a very white background such as white paper, a white pot or a white sink surface. 

Having green, yellow, or thickened phlegm (sputum) does not always indicate the presence of an infection. Also, if an infection is present, the color of the phlegm (sputum) does not determine whether a virus, a bacterium or another pathogen has caused it. Simple allergies can also cause changes in the color of the mucus. 

==Description==
The best sputum samples contain very little saliva, as saliva contaminates the sample with oral bacteria. This is especially true for samples for laboratory testing in cytology or microbiology. Specimen adequacy is assessed by the laboratory technologists by examining a Gram stain or cytology stain of the sputum. More than 25 squamous epithelial cells at low power magnification exam under the microscope strongly suggest salivary contamination. Sputum samples have been used to quantify the degree of airway inflammation in human diseases such as asthma. Specifically, this work has demonstrated that a subgroup of severe asthma patients has airway inflammation that is resistant to treatment with corticosteroids.

When a sputum specimen is plated out in microbiology, it is best to get the portion of the sample that almost looks like yellow pus onto the swab. If there is any blood in the sputum, this should also be on the swab. Microbiological sputum samples are used to look for infections, such as &quot;Moraxella catarrhalis&quot;, &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot;, &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;, and &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;. Other pathogens can also be found.

 sputum contains pus, composed of white blood cells, cellular debris, dead tissue, serous fluid, and viscous liquid (mucus). Purulent sputum is typically yellow or green. It is seen in cases of pneumonia, bronchiectasis, lung abscess, or an advanced stage of bronchitis.

==Interpretation==
Sputum can be (when examined by the naked eye):
*Bloody (hemoptysis)
**Blood-streaked sputum ‚Äìan indicator of possible inflammation of the throat (larynx and/or trachea) or bronchi; lung cancer; other bleeding erosions, ulcers, or tumors of the lower airway.
**Pink sputum ‚Äì it indicates sputum evenly mixed with blood from alveoli and/or small peripheral bronchi as is seen in potential pulmonary edema.
**Massive blood ‚Äì an indicator of possible cavitary tuberculosis or tumor such as lung cancer, or lung abscess; bronchiectasis; lung infarction; pulmonary embolism.
**Red, jelly-like sputum - an indicator of possible pneumonia caused by Klebsiella.
*Green or greenish colored - indicative of potential longstanding respiratory infection (green from degenerative changes in cell debris) as in pneumonia, ruptured lung abscess, chronic infectious bronchitis, and infected bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis.
*Rust colored ‚Äì usually caused by pneumococcal bacteria (in pneumonia), pulmonary embolism, lung cancer or pulmonary tuberculosis. 
*Brownish ‚Äìpotential indicator of chronic bronchitis (greenish/yellowish/brown); chronic pneumonia (whitish-brown); tuberculosis; lung cancer. 
*Yellow, yellowish purulent ‚Äì an indicator of the sample containing pus. &quot;The sputum color of patients with acute cough and no underlying chronic lung disease does not imply therapeutic consequences such as prescription of antibiotics.&quot; The color can provide hints as to effective treatment in chronic bronchitis patients:
**A yellow-greenish (mucopurulent) color suggests that treatment with antibiotics can reduce symptoms. The green color is caused by degenerating neutrophil verdoperoxidase.
*Whitish gray sputum color against a white color background (such as a white sink surface) tends to indicate either a specimen from someone who is dehydrated, and/or from an older person, and/or a specimen with a mixed, modest number of eosinophils and maybe some acute inflammatory neutrophil cells (this last choice tends to suggest chronic allergic bronchitis).
*A white, milky, or opaque (mucoid) appearance means that antibiotics are less likely to be effective in treatment because the likelihood is greater of a viral infection or allergy than of antibiotic-responsive micro-organisms. Thickness may indicate asthma.
*Foamy white ‚Äì may come from earlier-phase pulmonary edema.
*Frothy pink ‚Äì may indicate more severe pulmonary edema. Antibiotics may not be necessary at this time. 
*Clear ‚Äì pulmonary embolism (clear to frothy); COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (clear to gray); viral respiratory infection (clear to whitish and sometimes a hint of yellow); asthma (thick and white to yellowish).

<doc id="238725" wikidata="Q902491" url="?curid=238725" title="Loebner Prize">
<text>The Loebner Prize was an annual competition in artificial intelligence that awarded prizes to the computer programs considered by the judges to be the most human-like. The format of the competition was that of a standard Turing test. In each round, a human judge simultaneously held textual conversations with a computer program and a human being via computer. Based upon the responses, the judge would attempt to determine which was which.

The contest was launched in 1990 by Hugh Loebner in conjunction with the Cambridge Center for Behavioral Studies, Massachusetts, United States. In 2004 and 2005, it was held in Loebner&#x27;s apartment in New York City. Within the field of artificial intelligence, the Loebner Prize is somewhat controversial; the most prominent critic, Marvin Minsky, called it a publicity stunt that does not help the field along. Beginning in 2014, it was organised by the AISB at Bletchley Park. It has also been associated with Flinders University, Dartmouth College, the Science Museum in London, University of Reading and Ulster University, Magee Campus, Derry, UK City of Culture.

For the final 2019 competition, the format changed. There was no panel of judges. Instead, the chatbots were judged by the public and there were to be no human competitors. The prize has been reported as defunct as of 2020.

==Prizes==
Originally, $2,000 was awarded for the most human-seeming program in the competition. The prize was $3,000 in 2005 and $2,250 in 2006. In 2008, $3,000 was awarded.

In addition, there were two one-time-only prizes that have never been awarded. $25,000 is offered for the first program that judges cannot distinguish from a real human and which can convince judges that the human is the computer program. $100,000 is the reward for the first program that judges cannot distinguish from a real human in a Turing test that includes deciphering and understanding text, visual, and auditory input. The competition was planned to end after the achievement of this prize.

==Competition rules and restrictions==
The rules varied over the years and early competitions featured restricted conversation Turing tests but since 1995 the discussion has been unrestricted.

For the three entries in 2007, Robert Medeksza, Noah Duncan and Rollo Carpenter, some basic &quot;screening questions&quot; were used by the sponsor to evaluate the state of the technology. These included simple questions about the time, what round of the contest it is, etc.; general knowledge (&quot;What is a hammer for?&quot;); comparisons (&quot;Which is faster, a train or a plane?&quot;); and questions demonstrating memory for preceding parts of the same conversation. &quot;All nouns, adjectives and verbs will come from a dictionary suitable for children or adolescents under the age of 12.&quot; Entries did not need to respond &quot;intelligently&quot; to the questions to be accepted.

For the first time in 2008 the sponsor allowed introduction of a preliminary phase to the contest opening up the competition to previously disallowed web-based entries judged by a variety of invited interrogators. The available rules do not state how interrogators are selected or instructed. Interrogators (who judge the systems) have limited time: 5 minutes per entity in the 2003 competition, 20+ per pair in 2004‚Äì2007 competitions, 5 minutes to conduct &quot;simultaneous&quot; conversations with a human and the program in 2008‚Äì2009, increased to 25 minutes of simultaneous conversation since 2010.

==Criticisms==
The prize has long been scorned by experts in the field, for a variety of reasons.

It is regarded by many as a publicity stunt. Marvin Minsky scathingly offered a &quot;prize&quot; to anyone who could stop the competition. Loebner responded by jokingly observing that Minsky&#x27;s offering a prize to stop the competition effectively made him a co-sponsor.

The rules of the competition have encouraged poorly qualified judges to make rapid judgements. Interactions between judges and competitors was originally very brief, for example effectively 2.5 mins of questioning, which permitted only a few questions. Questioning was initially restricted to a single topic of the contestant&#x27;s choice, such as &quot;whimsical conversation&quot;, a domain suiting standard chatbot tricks.

Competition entrants do not aim at understanding or intelligence but resort to basic ELIZA style tricks, and successful entrants find deception and pretense is rewarded.

==Contests==

===2003===

In 2003, the contest was organised by Professor Richard H. R. Harper and Dr. Lynne Hamill from the Digital World Research Centre at the University of Surrey.

Although no bot passed the Turing test, the winner was Jabberwock, created by Juergen Pirner. Second was Elbot (Fred Roberts, Artificial Solutions). Third was Jabberwacky, (Rollo Carpenter).

===2006===
In 2006, the contest was organised by Tim Child (CEO of Televirtual) and Huma Shah. On August 30, the four finalists were announced:
* Rollo Carpenter
* Richard Churchill and Marie-Claire Jenkins
* Noah Duncan
* Robert Medeksza

The contest was held on 17 September in the VR theatre, Torrington Place campus of University College London. The judges included the University of Reading&#x27;s cybernetics professor, Kevin Warwick, a professor of artificial intelligence, John Barnden (specialist in metaphor research at the University of Birmingham), a barrister, Victoria Butler-Cole and a journalist, Graham Duncan-Rowe. The latter&#x27;s experience of the event can be found in an article in &quot;Technology Review&quot;. The winner was &#x27;Joan&#x27;, based on Jabberwacky, both created by Rollo Carpenter.

===2007===
The 2007 competition was held on October 21 in New York City. The judges were: computer science professor Russ Abbott, philosophy professor Hartry Field, psychology assistant professor Clayton Curtis and English lecturer Scott Hutchins.

No bot passed the Turing test, but the judges ranked the three contestants as follows:
* 1st: Robert Medeksza, creator of Ultra Hal
* 2nd: Noah Duncan, a private entry, creator of Cletus
* 3rd: Rollo Carpenter from Icogno, creator of Jabberwacky

The winner received $2,250 and the annual medal. The runners-up received $250 each.

===2008===
The 2008 competition was organised by professor Kevin Warwick, coordinated by Huma Shah and held on October 12 at the University of Reading, UK. After testing by over one hundred judges during the preliminary phase, in June and July 2008, six finalists were selected from thirteen original entrant artificial conversational entities (ACEs). Five of those invited competed in the finals:
*Brother Jerome, Peter Cole and Benji Adams
*Elbot, Fred Roberts / Artificial Solutions
*Eugene Goostman, Vladimir Veselov, Eugene Demchenko and Sergey Ulasen
*Jabberwacky, Rollo Carpenter
*Ultra Hal, Robert Medeksza

In the finals, each of the judges was given five minutes to conduct simultaneous, split-screen conversations with two hidden entities. Elbot of Artificial Solutions won the 2008 Loebner Prize bronze award, for &quot;most human-like&quot; artificial conversational entity, through fooling three of the twelve judges who interrogated it (in the human-parallel comparisons) into believing it was human. This is coming very close to the 30% traditionally required to consider that a program has actually passed the Turing test. Eugene Goostman and Ultra Hal both deceived one judge each that it was the human.

Will Pavia, a journalist for The Times, has written about his experience; a Loebner finals&#x27; judge, he was deceived by Elbot and Eugene. Kevin Warwick and Huma Shah have reported on the parallel-paired Turing tests.

=== 2009 ===

The 2009 Loebner Prize Competition was held September 6, 2009, at the Brighton Centre, Brighton UK in conjunction with the Interspeech 2009 conference. The prize amount for 2009 was $3,000.

Entrants were David Levy, Rollo Carpenter, and Mohan Embar, who finished in that order.

The writer Brian Christian participated in the 2009 Loebner Prize Competition as a human confederate, and described his experiences at the competition in his book &quot;The Most Human Human&quot;.

=== 2010 ===

The 2010 Loebner Prize Competition was held on October 23 at California State University, Los Angeles. The 2010 competition was the 20th running of the contest. The winner was Bruce Wilcox with Suzette.

=== 2011 ===
The 2011 Loebner Prize Competition was held on October 19 at the University of Exeter, Devon, United Kingdom. The prize amount for 2011 was $4,000.

The four finalists and their chatterbots were Bruce Wilcox (Rosette), Adeena Mignogna (Zoe), Mohan Embar (Chip Vivant) and Ron Lee (Tutor), who finished in that order.

That year there was an addition of a panel of junior judges, namely Georgia-Mae Lindfield, William Dunne, Sam Keat and Kirill Jerdev. The results of the junior contest were markedly different from the main contest, with chatterbots Tutor and Zoe tying for first place and Chip Vivant and Rosette coming in third and fourth place, respectively.

=== 2012 ===
The 2012 Loebner Prize Competition was held on the 15th of May in Bletchley Park in Bletchley, Buckinghamshire, England, in honor of the Alan Turing centenary celebrations. The prize amount for 2012 was $5,000. The local arrangements organizer was David Levy, who won the Loebner Prize in 1997 and 2009.

The four finalists and their chatterbots were Mohan Embar (Chip Vivant), Bruce Wilcox (Angela), Daniel Burke (Adam), M. Allan (Linguo), who finished in that order.

That year, a team from the University of Exeter&#x27;s computer science department (Ed Keedwell, Max Dupenois and Kent McClymont) conducted the first-ever live webcast of the conversations.

=== 2013 ===
The 2013 Loebner Prize Competition was held, for the only time on the Island of Ireland, on September 14 at the Ulster University, Magee College, Derry, Northern Ireland, UK.

The four finalists and their chatbots were Steve Worswick (Mitsuku), Dr. Ron C. Lee (Tutor), Bruce Wilcox (Rose) and Brian Rigsby (Izar), who finished in that order.

The judges were Professor Roger Schank (Socratic Arts), Professor Noel Sharkey (Sheffield University), Professor Minhua (Eunice) Ma (Huddersfield University, then University of Glasgow)
and Professor Mike McTear (Ulster University).

For the 2013 Junior Loebner Prize Competition the chatbots Mitsuku and Tutor tied for first place with Rose and Izar in 3rd and 4th place respectively.

=== 2014 ===
The 2014 Loebner Prize Competition was held at Bletchley Park, England, on Saturday 15 November 2014. The event was filmed live by Sky News. The guest judge was television presenter and broadcaster James May.

After 2 hours of judging, &#x27;Rose&#x27; by Bruce Wilcox was declared the winner. Bruce will receive a cheque for $4000 and a bronze medal. The ranks were as follows:

Rose ‚Äì Rank 1 ($4000 &amp; Bronze Medal); 
Izar ‚Äì Rank 2.25 ($1500); 
Uberbot ‚Äì Rank 3.25 ($1000); and 
Mitsuku ‚Äì Rank 3.5 ($500).

The Judges were Dr Ian Hocking, Writer &amp; Senior Lecturer in Psychology, Christ Church College, Canterbury; 
Dr Ghita Kouadri-Mostefaoui, Lecturer in Computer Science and Technology, University of Bedfordshire; 
Mr James May, Television Presenter and Broadcaster; and 
Dr Paul Sant, Dean of UCMK, University of Bedfordshire.

=== 2015 ===
The 2015 Loebner Prize Competition was again won by &#x27;Rose&#x27; by Bruce Wilcox.

The judges were Jacob Aaron, Physical sciences reporter for New Scientist; Rory Cellan-Jones, Technology correspondent for the BBC; Brett Marty, Film Director and Photographer; Ariadne Tampion, Writer.

=== 2016 ===
The 2016 Loebner Prize was held at Bletchley Park on 17 September 2016. After 2 hours of judging the final results were announced. 
The ranks were as follows:

*1st place: Mitsuku
*2nd place: Tutor 
*3rd place: Rose

=== 2017 ===
The 2017 Loebner Prize was held at Bletchley Park on 16 September 2017. This was the first contest where a new message by message protocol was used, rather than the traditional one character at a time.
The ranks were as follows, and were announced by a Nao_(robot):

*1st place: Mitsuku
*2nd place: Midge 
*3rd place: Uberbot
*4th place: Rose

=== 2018 ===
The 2018 Loebner Prize was held at Bletchley Park on 8 September 2018. This was the final time it would be held in its traditional Turing Test format and its final time at Bletchley Park.
The ranks were as follows:

*1st place: Mitsuku
*2nd place: Tutor 
*3rd place: Colombina
*4th place: Uberbot

=== 2019 ===
The 2019 Loebner Prize was held at the University of Swansea from 12th‚Äì15th September, as part of a larger exhibition which looked at creativity in computers. 
The format of the contest changed from being a traditional Turing Test, with selected judges and humans, into a 4 day testing session where members of the general public, including schoolchildren, could interact with the bots, knowing in advance that the bots were not humans. Seventeen bots took part instead of the usual 4 finalists. Steve Worswick won for a record 5th time with Mitsuku, which enabled him to be included in the Guinness Book of Records.

A selected jury of judges also examined and voted for the ones they liked best.
The ranks were as follows:

Most humanlike chatbot:
*1st place: Mitsuku ‚Äì 24 points
*2nd place: Uberbot ‚Äì 6 points
*3rd place: Anna ‚Äì 5 points

Best overall chatbot
*1st place: Mitsuku ‚Äì 19 points
*2nd place: Uberbot ‚Äì 5 points
*3rd place: Arckon ‚Äì 4 points

<doc id="238726" wikidata="Q211742" url="?curid=238726" title="Machine Head (album)">
<text>Machine Head is the sixth studio album by English rock band Deep Purple. It was recorded in December 1971 in Montreux, Switzerland, and released on 30 March 1972, by Purple Records. It is the band&#x27;s third album to feature the Mark II line-up of Ritchie Blackmore, Ian Gillan, Roger Glover, Jon Lord and Ian Paice.

Previous recording sessions had been slotted into the group&#x27;s gigging schedule. This time, Deep Purple wanted to dedicate time to record an album away from the typical studio environment, hoping it would result in a sound closer to their live shows. They used the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio for recording and block-booked the Montreux Casino as a venue, but during a Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention concert immediately before the sessions, the casino burned to the ground after an audience member fired a flare gun into the ceiling. After a week of searching for an alternative venue, including a session at a nearby theatre that was abandoned due to noise complaints, the band managed to book the Grand Hotel, closed for the winter, and converted it into a live room suitable for recording. These events, particularly the casino fire, became the inspiration for the song &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot;.

&quot;Machine Head&quot; became Deep Purple&#x27;s most commercially successful album, topping the charts in several countries, including the UK. Influential in the development of heavy metal, it continues to be viewed favourably by music critics and has been reissued several times. It is widely considered one of the greatest and most influential rock albums of all time.

==Background==
By 1971, Deep Purple had been touring for two years and earlier studio albums, such as &quot;Deep Purple in Rock&quot; (1970) and &quot;Fireball&quot; (1971) were recorded in between live shows. The band felt that prior studio work did not sound as good as their live performances, and wanted to record in a stage environment. Drummer Ian Paice recorded his kit in the corridor for some of the &quot;Fireball&quot; sessions, believing it sounded better, and he wanted to find an alternative recording environment away from a typical sound-proofed studio. Deep Purple were advised to record outside the United Kingdom as they would not have to pay as much income tax.

The group toured the UK from September to October 1971 and previewed some new material that was ultimately released on &quot;Machine Head&quot;, in particular &quot;Highway Star&quot; and &quot;Lazy&quot;. They then began a tour of the United States, which ended up being cancelled after two gigs after singer Ian Gillan contracted hepatitis. Guitarist Ritchie Blackmore started to think about possible solo work for the future, teaming up with Paice and Phil Lynott for a brief period as a possible side-project, and Deep Purple as a whole looked forward to a dedicated block of time to record, getting away from the pressures of touring.

Deep Purple initially planned to record &quot;Machine Head&quot; at Montreux Casino in Switzerland in December 1971. They had booked the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio and made hotel reservations. The casino was a large arena, containing several entertainment facilities. The band had performed there in May 1971, and befriended Claude Nobs, founder and general manager of the Montreux Jazz Festival. Among others, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, and Black Sabbath had all performed at the casino. It closed for refurbishments each winter, allowing it to be used as a recording venue. Deep Purple arrived there on 3 December 1971. After a final concert, they would have the location to themselves. In return, the band tentatively proposed to perform a show at the casino, which would have allowed them to release a double album, half live and half studio.

==Recording==

The last gig at Montreux Casino was a matin√©e performance by Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention. At the time, the group included singers Flo &amp; Eddie, multi-instrumentalist Ian Underwood and drummer Aynsley Dunbar. During the show, a member of the audience fired a flare into the building&#x27;s roof. Although the audience were initially unaware of the incident because the roof was covered by a false bamboo ceiling, about an hour into the set, people started seeing sparks emerging. The group stopped playing; according to bassist Roger Glover, Zappa said that &quot;no-one should panic, but ... FIRE!&quot; After this, management ordered a controlled evacuation. There were no fatalities, but a group were briefly trapped in the casino&#x27;s basement before being rescued by Nobs. Shortly after everyone had been safely evacuated, the building went up in flames.

Nobs relocated Deep Purple to the Pavilion, a nearby theatre, where they recorded the basic tracks for a song provisionally named &quot;Title No.¬†1&quot;. Glover recalled waking up one morning saying the title &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; out loud. From this, Gillan wrote the lyrics which describe the experience in Montreux. A photograph of the burning Montreux Casino was included in the album&#x27;s gatefold cover.

The Pavilion proved to be impractical to record in, as nearby residents complained to the police about the noise. Although roadies tried to prevent the police entering by holding the doors shut, the band were quickly evicted. They searched for other recording locations and settled with the empty Grand Hotel, on the edge of Montreux. With the mobile unit parked at the main entrance, Deep Purple set up at the end of a corridor off the main lobby where the hallway came to a &quot;T&quot;. An assortment of equipment and sound-insulating mattresses were installed, which meant the band had to walk through bedrooms and across balconies to get to the recording van. This proved so arduous that Deep Purple stopped listening to playbacks of their recordings, instead performing until they were satisfied. A closed-circuit television system was set up so the band could communicate with engineer Martin Birch and allow staff in the studio control room to see them.
==Songs==

The opening track, &quot;Highway Star&quot; was written while the group were on a coach travelling to their opening UK tour date in Portsmouth on 13 September 1971. The band&#x27;s management arranged for them to travel to the gig with a group of music journalists who could interview the band at their leisure. One of them asked Blackmore how he wrote songs, upon which he said, &quot;like this&quot;, picked up the guitar and played the song&#x27;s opening riff. Gillan improvised a set of lyrics around: &quot;We&#x27;re on the road, we&#x27;re a rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll band&quot;. The rest of the band completed the arrangement during rehearsals and it was added to the show on the evening of the gig. Blackmore based his guitar solo around a figure that he learned from Johnny Burnette, and liked its resemblance to Johann Sebastian Bach.

&quot;Maybe I&#x27;m A Leo&quot; went under the working title of &quot;One Just Before Midnight&quot;, which appears in a picture of a recording sheet on the album sleeve. The finished title and lyrics refer to Gillan&#x27;s birth sign. Glover wrote the song&#x27;s main riff after listening to John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;How Do You Sleep?&quot;, and he liked that the riff did not start on the first beat of the bar. The song was played live once in 1972 at a BBC In Concert performance. It became a live favourite years later, after Joe Satriani temporarily joined the band in 1993.

&quot;Pictures of Home&quot; describes the sights and images of the local area around Montreux, far away from home. The track was initially recorded with a drum introduction, which was left off the original recording; however, it was added for the 25th anniversary reissue. The track was also played live after Satriani joined Deep Purple. &quot;Never Before&quot; was considered by the band to be the most commercial track on the album, and was released as a single. The song was played live once at the BBC In Concert show.
&quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; documents the experiences of recording &quot;Machine Head&quot;, including the casino fire and evacuation, and the sessions at the Grand Hotel. The title referred to thick black smoke from the fire hanging over the shore of Lake Geneva. The backing track was the only usable material that came from the Pavilion recordings, before police shut the sessions down. Blackmore contributed the opening guitar riff, and later said it was popular due to being simple and based around four notes, comparing it to the opening musical phrasing of Beethoven&#x27;s Fifth Symphony. Although the track is the most famous by Deep Purple, and one of the most famous in rock music in general, the band did not think it had much commercial potential, and it was one of the last of the tracks from &quot;Machine Head&quot; to be played live. The song was subsequently a major chart hit in the US, reaching number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. As well as Deep Purple, Gillan has performed the song live as part of his solo career, and during his brief time with Black Sabbath in 1983.

&quot;Lazy&quot; was first played live during the 1971 UK tour, and retained throughout the following year. It was performed towards the end of the live show, replacing the instrumental workout &quot;Wring That Neck&quot;, and was later moved mid-set in early 1972. Glover said the song was roughly based on an Oscar Brown song, &quot;Sleepy&quot;, while Blackmore stated it was inspired by Eric Clapton&#x27;s &quot;Stepping Out&quot;. The song was designed to be a vehicle for various instrumental showcases, including an unaccompanied organ introduction and Gillan&#x27;s harmonica. Blackmore recorded the guitar solos in sections on two different days, which were then joined.

&quot;Space Truckin&#x27;&quot; was written as a pastiche of 1950s rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll lyrics, but with a science fiction theme. Deep Purple began thinking of nonsense phrases such as &quot;music in our solar system&quot; that would fit. Paice played a short drum solo on the track. It was first played live in January 1972 at the next gig following the Montreux sessions, and led into the instrumental section of the earlier live showcase &quot;Mandrake Root&quot; as the closing number. The song remained the last number in the set after Gillan and Glover left the band in 1973, including a memorable performance at the California Jam the following year, where Blackmore set fire to his amplifiers and destroyed a TV camera with his guitar. The song was regularly played as a wakeup call by the crew on board the Space Shuttle program flight STS-107 in 2003.

A ballad entitled &quot;When a Blind Man Cries&quot; was recorded during the &quot;Machine Head&quot; sessions, but was not included on the album. Instead, it was used as the B-side on the &quot;Never Before&quot; single. The song appears as a bonus track on the 25th anniversary edition of &quot;Machine Head&quot;.

==Release and artwork==
The album was released in the UK on 30 March 1972. A US tour for March and April that year was postponed after Blackmore fell ill. The first shows in the UK, promoting the album were at the Rainbow Theatre in June 1972. Two months later, the band toured Japan for the first time, recordings of which become the double live album &quot;Made in Japan&quot;. Four songs from &quot;Machine Head&quot; (&quot;Highway Star&quot;, &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot;, &quot;Lazy&quot; and &quot;Space Truckin&#x27;&quot;) were included in the album.

The album title was inspired by the adjustment knobs on Roger Glover‚Äôs bass; such knobs on string instruments are known as a machine head, and the back album cover features a picture of Glover&#x27;s bass headstock.

The cover art was created by stamping the album title into a polished metal sheet, which was held up to act as a mirror in front of which the group stood. The photographer Shepard Sherbell then took a picture of the reflection; a small trace of him can be made out on the finished picture (just below the &quot;Head&quot; text). The album&#x27;s inner sleeve was mostly designed by Glover and manager Tony Edwards, and features a selection of mug shots that were previously used for record company contact sheets. It included a picture of Nobs, to whom &quot;Machine Head&quot; was dedicated. The initial pressings also had a hand-printed lyric sheet.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Machine Head&quot; reached number one in its second week on the UK Albums Chart, remaining there for two weeks before returning in May 1972 for a further week. In the US, during its initial release in 1972, the album reached number 34; the album then peaked at number 7 in 1973 when &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; became a hit, and &quot;Machine Head&quot; remained on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts for over two years. The first single released from the album, &quot;Never Before&quot;, reached number 35 in the UK and did not chart in the US. Prompted by heavy radio play of &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; as an album cut, Warner Brothers eventually released it as a single in May 1973. The song reached number two on the Canadian &quot;RPM&quot; chart and number four on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

The album was met with positive reviews from critics. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s Lester Bangs praised the lyrics to &quot;Highway Star&quot; and &quot;Space Truckin&#x27;&quot; as well as all the music, although he was less complimentary about the lyrics of the remaining songs: &quot;In between those two Deep Purple classics lies nothing but good, hard-socking music, although some of the lyrics may leave a bit to be desired.&quot; Concluding his review, he admitted: &quot;I do know that this very banality is half the fun of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll. And I am confident that I will love the next five Deep Purple albums madly so long as they sound exactly like these last three.&quot; Robert Christgau wrote of the album: &quot;I approve of their speeding, and Ritchie Blackmore has copped some self-discipline as well as a few suspicious-sounding licks from his buddies in London.&quot; AllMusic critic Eduardo Rivadavia called &quot;Machine Head&quot; &quot;one of the essential hard rock albums of all time.&quot;

Blackmore noted that &quot;Machine Head&quot; was recorded in about three weeks, remarking that &quot;everything was natural and it all worked.&quot; He further stated, &quot;I didn&#x27;t like &quot;Fireball&quot; very much because we were just working too much. But we had about a month off before &quot;Machine Head&quot;, which allowed me to get my head together and write some stuff.&quot; On the 50th anniversary of &quot;Machine Head&quot; in 2022, Ian Gillan remarked, &quot;It was a milestone for sure because it took us two albums to get there. It took &quot;In Rock&quot; and &quot;Fireball&quot; to reach &quot;Machine Head&quot;. &quot;Machine Head&quot; is a slightly more refined version of those earthier ones. It&#x27;s a historical album, and we&#x27;re still doing &#x27;Highway Star,&#x27; we still do &#x27;Pictures of Home,&#x27; which are actually the two opening tracks in our live set right now. And of course, we still do &#x27;Smoke on the Water,&#x27; which always goes down a treat.&quot;

&quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine ranked &quot;Machine Head&quot; at number 35 on their &quot;100 Greatest Heavy Metal Albums of All Time&quot; list in 1989. In an &quot;Observer Music Monthly&quot; Greatest British Albums poll, Ozzy Osbourne chose the album as one of his 10 favourite British records of all time. &quot;Machine Head&quot; became the subject of one of the &quot;Classic Albums&quot; series of documentaries about the making of famous albums. In 2001, &quot;Machine Head&quot; was mentioned in &quot;Q&quot;‚Ä≥s &quot;50 Heaviest Albums of All Time&quot;, while in 2007, it featured in &quot;The Guardian&quot;‚Ä≥s 2007 edition of &quot;1000 Albums to Hear Before You Die&quot;.

==Reissues==
The album was released on the multichannel formats DVD-Audio (2001), in a new 5.1 channel mix and Super Audio CD (SACD) (2003) with the European quadraphonic mix. It was later released via SACD on 17 August 2011, through Warner Music Group in the Warner Premium Sound series of the label, which has the same 5.1 channel mix as the 2001 DVD-Audio version.

The 40th anniversary edition of &quot;Machine Head&quot; was released in October 2012 by EMI; this is a five-disc set, accompanied by an illustrated 60-page hardback booklet. Its contents include: &quot;Original album 2012 remaster&quot; (CD1), &quot;Roger Glover&#x27;s 1997 mixes&quot; (CD2), &quot;Original album quad SQ stereo&quot; (2012 remaster) (CD3), &quot;In Concert &#x27;72&quot; from Paris Theatre, London, 9 March 1972 ‚Äì 2012 mix (CD4), 2012 high-resolution remaster and surround mixes (DVD, audio only). To celebrate the 40th anniversary, a tribute album &quot;Re-Machined: A Tribute to Deep Purple&#x27;s Machine Head&quot; was released in September 2012, through Eagle Rock Entertainment.

A new &quot;Machine Head: Super Deluxe Edition&quot; was reissued 29 March 2024 by Rhino with a new remix (including the b-side &quot;When A Blind Man Cries&quot;) produced by Dweezil Zappa and a new remaster of the original mix by Andy Pearce on CD 1. The edition includes two live performances: the first being recorded on 9 March 1972 at Paris Theatre in London (CD2, previously available as &quot;In Concert &#x27;72&quot;), the second being recorded earlier in April 1971 at Montreux Casino in Switzerland (CD3). The new remix is also included on a vinyl LP, with &quot;When A Blind Man Cries&quot; inserted between &quot;Lazy&quot; and &quot;Space Truckin&#x27;&quot;. Furthermore, the set contains a Blu-ray audio-only disc including Zappa&#x27;s Atmos Mix, 1974 U.S. Quad (available for the first time on a digital medium), and three tracks in 5.1 surround (taken from the 2001 DVD-A).

<doc id="238727" wikidata="Q4807899" url="?curid=238727" title="Silvertone (album)">
<text>Silvertone is the debut album by American musician Chris Isaak, released in 1985. It was named after the band that Isaak co-founded and led, though only guitarist James Calvin Wilsey is credited on the album. The album sold poorly in the US but became a minor hit in Australia, peaking at #77 in June 1986.

==Background and recording==
The band Silvertone consisted of Isaak (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), James Wilsey (lead guitar, backing vocals), Jamie Ayers (upright bass) and John Silvers (drums) from 1980 to 1982. The band became involved with veteran producer Erik Jacobsen within a year of forming and signed with his production company. Jacobsen interested Warner Bros. Records in signing the band, and the label allotted them a small budget to record demos; however, neither Warner Bros. nor the band members were happy with the recordings.

Dissatisfied with his rhythm section, Isaak fired Silvers in 1982 and then Ayers a year later, with Isaak and Wilsey continuing work with session drummers Prairie Prince and Jim Keltner and bassist Chris Solberg. Recording for the album began in earnest in 1983, with Jacobsen financing the sessions himself, and concluded in 1984. Ayers later claimed that his bass parts on two tracks remained on the final album, uncredited; Jacobsen commented that this is possible, but could not remember for certain.

==Release==
Though Isaak and his band had been billed collectively as Silvertone for years, with Isaak and Wilsey considered equal creative partners, Jacobsen envisioned Isaak as a solo star, and the recording and publishing contracts Isaak signed positioned him as the sole bandleader business-wise. Additionally, the band was persuaded by Warner Bros. to downplay the name Silvertone to avoid a lawsuit from Sears, of whom Silvertone was a trademarked brand name for consumer electronics and musical instruments.

Warner Bros. released &quot;Silvertone&quot; in January 1985. The cover photograph was conceived by Isaak as an homage to Elvis Presley&#x27;s 1958 single sleeve for &quot;Don&#x27;t&quot;. Isaak promoted the release with multi-week residencies at the Nightbreak club in San Francisco and the Anti-Club in Los Angeles, followed by a club tour of North America and Europe. For the tour, Isaak and Wilsey recruited bassist Rowland Salley and drummer Kenney Dale Johnson, who would remain permanent members. Despite the album receiving positive reviews and endorsements from established artists such as John Fogerty, &quot;Silvertone&quot; was a commercial flop in the United States, selling approximately 14,000 copies. By 2006, it had sold 147,000 copies.

==Tracks in popular culture==
The album was not a hit until the song &quot;Gone Ridin was featured in the 1986 David Lynch film &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;, the first of many Isaak/Lynch collaborations, though the song had previously appeared on the soundtrack to the film &quot;American Flyers&quot; the year before. &quot;Livin‚Äô for Your Lover&quot; is also featured in the former. &quot;Dancin appeared in the film &quot;Modern Girls&quot; released the same year, but wasn&#x27;t included on the soundtrack. It also appeared in the season 2 episode of Miami Vice &#x27;Payback&#x27;. &quot;Gone Ridin was used in the 1987 comedy &quot;Morgan Stewart&#x27;s Coming Home&quot;. Two songs from this album were played on the Fox&#x27;s long running teen drama &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; including &quot;Gone Ridin, which was played in the Season 2 episode &quot;Pass, Not Pass&quot;; and &quot;Dancin which was played in the Season 3 episode &quot;Castles in the Sand&quot;.

<doc id="238728" wikidata="Q163211" url="?curid=238728" title="Lita Ford">
<text>Lita Rossana Ford (born September 19, 1958) is a British-American guitarist, vocalist, and songwriter. She was the lead guitarist for the all-female rock band the Runaways in the late 1970s, and then embarked on a successful glam metal solo career that hit its peak in the late 1980s. The 1989 single &quot;Close My Eyes Forever&quot;, a duet with Ozzy Osbourne, remains Ford&#x27;s most successful song, reaching No. 8 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

==Early life==
Ford was born to Harry Lenard Ford and Isabella Benvenuto in London, England; her father was British and her mother was Italian. When she was in second grade, she moved with her family to the United States, eventually settling in Long Beach, California.

Inspired by Ritchie Blackmore&#x27;s work with Deep Purple, she began playing the guitar at the age of 11. Her vocal range is mezzo-soprano.

==Music career==
===The Runaways (1975‚Äì1979)===

In 1975, at age sixteen, Ford was recruited by recording impresario Kim Fowley to join the all-female rock band The Runaways. The band soon secured a recording contract and released their first album in 1976. The band garnered significant media attention and the Runaways became a successful recording and touring act during their late-1970s heyday. Ford&#x27;s lead-guitar playing became an integral element of the band&#x27;s sound until their eventual break-up in April 1979.

In 2016, Ford published her autobiography, &quot;Living Like a Runaway: A Memoir&quot;, through Dey Street Books. In the book, Ford claimed that she left The Runaways temporarily in 1976, after coming to the conclusion that her bandmates &quot;were all into girls.¬†All of them except for Jackie [Fox]&#x27;, a situation she didn&#x27;t feel comfortable with.

In 1977, internal conflicts were erupting within the Runaways, who had by that time already parted ways with producer Fowley, lead singer Cherie Currie, and bassist Jackie Fox. Vocalist/guitarist Joan Jett wanted the band to shift to a more Ramones-influenced punk rock sound, while Ford and drummer Sandy West wanted to continue playing the hard rock-oriented songs the band had become known for. With neither faction willing to compromise, the band finally broke up in April 1979.

===Solo career (1982‚Äì1995)===

In 1982, Ford signed with Mercury Records and set about launching a solo career. Her debut solo album, &quot;Out for Blood&quot;, released in 1983, was a commercial disappointment. Her next release, &quot;Dancin&#x27; on the Edge&quot; (1984) achieved moderate success, and Ford&#x27;s popularity began to rise. &quot;Dancin&#x27; on the Edge&quot; included the single &quot;Fire in My Heart&quot;, which reached the Top 10 in several countries outside the United States. The follow-up single, &quot;Gotta Let Go&quot;, performed better. Ford said in an interview that she recorded an unreleased album with RCA Records, and Tony Iommi did not perform on it.

Ford signed with RCA Records, hired Sharon Osbourne Management, and re-emerged with a more radio-friendly pop-metal sound. In 1988, she released her most commercially successful album, &quot;Lita&quot;. The album featured several singles including &quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot;, &quot;Back to the Cave&quot;, &quot;Close My Eyes Forever&quot;, and &quot;Falling in and Out of Love&quot;, a song co-written by Nikki Sixx of M√∂tley Cr√ºe. The ballad &quot;Close My Eyes Forever&quot;, a duet with Ozzy Osbourne, remains her most successful song, reaching No. 8 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.
Ford followed up the success of &quot;Lita&quot; with the album &quot;Stiletto&quot; (1990). &quot;Stiletto&quot; featured the singles &quot;Hungry&quot; and &quot;Lisa&quot; (a song dedicated to her mother). However, the album failed to match the success of her previous release. Ford&#x27;s next release was &quot;Dangerous Curves&quot; (1991), which featured her last charting single to date, &quot;Shot of Poison&quot;. Ford&#x27;s final album prior to a lengthy recording hiatus was &quot;Black&quot; on the German ZYX Records.

===Long hiatus (1996‚Äì2007)===

By the mid-1990s, Ford had turned her attention towards raising her two young sons, causing her music career to become less of a priority. Following the release of &quot;Black&quot; in 1995, Ford did not release new material until &quot;Wicked Wonderland&quot; in 2009.

===Return to stage (2008‚Äìpresent)===
In June 2008, Ford re-emerged with a new band with Stet Howland (W.A.S.P.) on drums, playing several warm-up gigs under the moniker &quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot; prior to Rocklahoma in Pryor, Oklahoma. In June 2009, she toured the United States and Europe with a new line-up on her last fourteen shows, consisting of former Guns N&#x27; Roses guitarist Ron &quot;Bumblefoot&quot; Thal, drummer Dennis Leeflang, and Deepfield bassist PJ Farley.

After a long recording hiatus, Ford released &quot;Wicked Wonderland&quot; on October 6, 2009, on the JLRG Entertainment label. In an interview with ExclusiveMagazine.com, Ford spoke about her new material: &quot;I just wanted to kick ass! I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s popular, or the flavor of the day. I just wanted the music to rock! The lyrics are very personal and that&#x27;s it. I wasn&#x27;t going to come out in sandals with hairy armpits!&quot;

In May 2011, Ford promised to release a &quot;real comeback album&quot; later in the year with drummer Chuck Spradlin, saying that 2009&#x27;s nu metal-inspired &quot;Wicked Wonderland&quot; was too much of a collaborative project with ex-husband Jim Gillette. &quot;A lot of people have told me that they want a real Lita Ford album, and I know what they mean. They are going to get it&quot;, she was quoted as saying at the time.

&quot;Living Like a Runaway&quot; was released in June 2012 on SPV/Steamhammer Records. True to her word, the album was much more in line with her earlier work. The title is also celebratory, as Ford had recently settled differences with her former Runaways&#x27; bandmates. During 2014, she was bestowed with The Certified Legend Award by &quot;Guitar Player&quot;.

In November 2014, Heaven Below guitarist Patrick Kennison joined Ford&#x27;s band.

In 2016, Ford released &quot;Time Capsule&quot;, a collection of songs she discovered on old analogue tapes from the 1980s, featuring recordings she had made with Billy Sheehan, Gene Simmons, Bruce Kulick, Robin Zander, Rick Nielsen, Dave Navarro, Rodger Carter, and Jeff Scott Soto.

==Acting and other projects==

During her solo career, Ford endorsed musical instrument manufacturer B.C. Rich and exclusively used several of the brand&#x27;s guitars, most notably the Warlock. The 1992 TV series &quot;Howie&quot;, starring Howie Mandel, saw Ford as a regular guitarist for the house band. Ford also had a small role in the 1992 horror/comedy film &quot;Highway to Hell&quot;, playing a character called &quot;The Hitchhiker&quot;, and played herself in a 1993 episode of Fox comedy television series Herman&#x27;s Head. Ford was also asked by VH-1 to join the cast of the seventh season of the reality television program &quot;The Surreal Life&quot; in 2007, to which she declined.
Ford contributed her likeness and voice to the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC video game &quot;Br√ºtal Legend&quot;. She appears as the character Lita Halford, alongside Jack Black, Tim Curry, Ozzy Osbourne, Rob Halford, and Lemmy Kilmister. Her song &quot;Betrayal&quot; is also one of the 100+ songs that appear in the game.

In 2010, a major Hollywood motion picture chronicling the career of Ford&#x27;s first band, The Runaways, was produced. Ford was portrayed by actress Scout Taylor-Compton in the movie, entitled &quot;The Runaways&quot;. Ford is featured extensively in the 2005 documentary film &quot;&quot;, in which she spoke candidly about her time in the all-female band. Among other things, she alludes to verbal and sexual abuse endured by the band members at the hands of their management, specifically Kim Fowley.

In 2013, Ford reunited with former Runaways bandmate Cherie Currie to record a Christmas single. The single tied into work Currie and Ford both have done on behalf of Toys for Tots, a charity run by the US Marine Corps, which gives holiday toys to children of need.

Ford appeared on the May/June 2013 cover of &quot;Making Music Magazine&quot; to discuss her life and career.

In 2014, Ford narrated &quot;The Life, Blood, and Rhythm of Randy Castillo&quot;.

Ford competed on the reality cooking show &quot;Chopped&quot; in hopes of raising $10,000 for her charity. Ford made it through the first round, but was eliminated in the second round.

Ford released her autobiography &quot;Living Like a Runaway&quot; in June 2016.

In 2018, Ford and Jim Cara started Lita Ford Guitars, creating guitars and experiences for fans and players.

Ford has also made regular cameo appearances as a guest commentator for the AXS TV show &quot;Top Ten Revealed&quot;. 

==Personal life==
In the mid-1980s, Ford was briefly engaged to guitarist Tony Iommi of Black Sabbath. Iommi co-produced her album &quot;The Bride Wore Black&quot;, which was never released. Ford said in a 1989 interview with &quot;Kerrang!&quot; that &quot;there&#x27;s a certain amount of bad blood between Tony and I&quot;. She claimed in her autobiography that Iommi physically abused her throughout the relationship.

Ford was married to W.A.S.P. guitarist Chris Holmes in the early 1990s for a short time. After the couple divorced, Ford met former Nitro vocalist Jim Gillette in 1994; the couple were married after knowing each other for only two weeks. They have two sons, James and Rocco. The family moved to Turks and Caicos, where Gillette operated a small construction and real estate development business.

The marriage to Gillette began to crumble after he entered into negotiations with TLC for a reality TV show, tentatively titled &quot;The Gillettes: An Extreme American Family&quot;. In a March 2011 interview on the Classic Rock Revisited website, Ford claimed that she had taken a business trip to Los Angeles to discuss the show with TLC executives, and returned home to find her husband and sons not speaking to her. Ford also claimed that Gillette turned the couple&#x27;s children against her by insinuating that she was going to do harm to them, after she had assumed a greater level of control in the proposed series. She subsequently claimed that Gillette began encouraging her sons to physically attack her, a situation which prompted her to seek a divorce. In a February 2011 radio interview, Ford acknowledged that her marriage to Gillette was indeed over, ending any plans for a television series. Following the end of her relationship with Gillette, Ford became an advocate for the awareness of parental alienation.

<doc id="238729" wikidata="Q107238" url="?curid=238729" title="Eosinophil">
<text>Eosinophils, sometimes called eosinophiles or, less commonly, acidophils, are a variety of white blood cells and one of the immune system components responsible for combating multicellular parasites and certain infections in vertebrates. Along with mast cells and basophils, they also control mechanisms associated with allergy and asthma. They are granulocytes that develop during hematopoiesis in the bone marrow before migrating into blood, after which they are terminally differentiated and do not multiply. 

These cells are eosinophilic or &quot;acid-loving&quot; due to their large acidophilic cytoplasmic granules, which show their affinity for acids by their affinity to coal tar dyes: Normally transparent, it is this affinity that causes them to appear brick-red after staining with eosin, a red dye, using the Romanowsky method. The staining is concentrated in small granules within the cellular cytoplasm, which contain many chemical mediators, such as eosinophil peroxidase, ribonuclease (RNase), deoxyribonucleases (DNase), lipase, plasminogen, and major basic protein. These mediators are released by a process called degranulation following activation of the eosinophil, and are toxic to both parasite and host tissues.

In normal individuals, eosinophils make up about 1‚Äì3% of white blood cells, and are about 12‚Äì17 micrometres in size with bilobed nuclei. While eosinophils are released into the bloodstream, they reside in tissue. They are found in the medulla and the junction between the cortex and medulla of the thymus, and, in the lower gastrointestinal tract, ovaries, uterus, spleen, prostate, and lymph nodes, but not in the lungs, skin, esophagus, or some other internal organs under normal conditions. The presence of eosinophils in these latter organs is associated with disease. For instance, patients with eosinophilic asthma have high levels of eosinophils that lead to inflammation and tissue damage, making it more difficult for patients to breathe. Eosinophils persist in the circulation for 8‚Äì12 hours, and can survive in tissue for an additional 8‚Äì12 days in the absence of stimulation. Pioneering work in the 1980s elucidated that eosinophils were unique granulocytes, having the capacity to survive for extended periods of time after their maturation as demonstrated by ex-vivo culture experiments.

==Development==

TH2 and ILC2 cells both express the transcription factor GATA-3, which promotes the production of TH2 cytokines, including the interleukins (ILs). IL-5 controls the development of eosinophils in the bone marrow, as they differentiate from myeloid precursor cells. Their lineage fate is determined by transcription factors, including GATA and C/EBP. Eosinophils produce and store many secondary granule proteins prior to their exit from the bone marrow. After maturation, eosinophils circulate in blood and migrate to inflammatory sites in tissues, or to sites of helminth infection in response to chemokines like CCL11 (eotaxin-1), CCL24 (eotaxin-2), CCL5 (RANTES), 5-hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid and 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid, and certain leukotrienes like leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and MCP1/4. Interleukin-13, another TH2 cytokine, primes eosinophilic exit from the bone marrow by lining vessel walls with adhesion molecules such as VCAM-1 and ICAM-1.
When eosinophils are activated, they undergo cytolysis, where the breaking of the cell releases eosinophilic granules found in extracellular DNA traps. High concentrations of these DNA traps are known to cause cellular damage, as the granules they contain are responsible for the ligand-induced secretion of eosinophilic toxins which cause structural damage. There is evidence to suggest that eosinophil granule protein expression is regulated by the non-coding RNA EGOT.

== Function ==

Following activation, eosinophils effector functions include production of the following:
* Cationic granule proteins and their release by degranulation
* Reactive oxygen species such as hypobromite, superoxide, and peroxide (hypobromous acid, which is preferentially produced by eosinophil peroxidase)
* Lipid mediators like the eicosanoids from the leukotriene (e.g., LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) and prostaglandin (e.g., PGE2) families
* Enzymes, such as elastase
* Growth factors such as TGF beta, VEGF, and PDGF
* Cytokines such as IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-9, IL-13, and TNF alpha

There are also eosinophils that play a role in fighting viral infections, which is evident from the abundance of RNases they contain within their granules, and in fibrin removal during inflammation. Eosinophils, along with basophils and mast cells, are important mediators of allergic responses and asthma pathogenesis and are associated with disease severity. They also fight helminth (worm) colonization and may be slightly elevated in the presence of certain parasites. Eosinophils are also involved in many other biological processes, including postpubertal mammary gland development, oestrus cycling, allograft rejection and neoplasia. They have also been implicated in antigen presentation to T cells.

Eosinophils are responsible for tissue damage and inflammation in many diseases, including asthma. High levels of interleukin-5 has been observed to up regulate the expression of adhesion molecules, which then facilitate the adhesion of eosinophils to endothelial cells, thereby causing inflammation and tissue damage.

An accumulation of eosinophils in the nasal mucosa is considered a major diagnostic criterion for allergic rhinitis (nasal allergies).

==Granule proteins==
Following activation by an immune stimulus, eosinophils degranulate to release an array of cytotoxic granule cationic proteins that are capable of inducing tissue damage and dysfunction. These include:
* major basic protein (MBP)
* eosinophil cationic protein (ECP)
* eosinophil peroxidase (EPX)
* eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN)

Major basic protein, eosinophil peroxidase, and eosinophil cationic protein are toxic to many tissues. Eosinophil cationic protein and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin are ribonucleases with antiviral activity. Major basic protein induces mast cell and basophil degranulation, and is implicated in peripheral nerve remodelling. Eosinophil cationic protein creates toxic pores in the membranes of target cells, allowing potential entry of other cytotoxic molecules to the cell, can inhibit proliferation of T cells, suppress antibody production by B cells, induce degranulation by mast cells, and stimulate fibroblast cells to secrete mucus and glycosaminoglycans. Eosinophil peroxidase forms reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen intermediates that promote oxidative stress in the target, causing cell death by apoptosis and necrosis.

==Clinical significance==
===Blood count===
Strong evidence indicates that blood eosinophil counts can predict the effectiveness of specific anti-inflammatory drugs. Despite their increasing use in clinical practice, data on &quot;normal&quot; blood eosinophil counts remain insufficient. Due to the right-skewed distribution of these counts, median values are more informative than mean values for determining normal levels. Few large-scale studies have reported median blood eosinophil counts, with the median for healthy individuals being 100 cells/ŒºL and the 95th percentile at 420 cells/ŒºL. Thus, it is now evident that the normal median blood eosinophil count in healthy adults is around 100 cells/ŒºL, with counts above 400 cells/ŒºL considered outside the normal range. Current cutoffs such as 150 or 300 cells/ŒºL used in asthma or COPD management fall within the normal range.

===Eosinophilia===

An increase in eosinophils, i.e., the presence of more than 500 eosinophils/microlitre of blood is called an eosinophilia, and is typically seen in people with a parasitic infestation of the intestines; autoimmune and collagen vascular disease (such as rheumatoid arthritis) and Systemic lupus erythematosus; malignant diseases such as eosinophilic leukemia, clonal hypereosinophilia, and Hodgkin lymphoma; lymphocyte-variant hypereosinophilia; extensive skin diseases (such as exfoliative dermatitis); Addison&#x27;s disease and other causes of low corticosteroid production (corticosteroids suppress blood eosinophil levels); reflux esophagitis (in which eosinophils will be found in the squamous epithelium of the esophagus) and eosinophilic esophagitis; and with the use of certain drugs such as penicillin. But, perhaps the most common cause for eosinophilia is an allergic condition such as asthma. In 1989, contaminated L-tryptophan supplements caused a deadly form of eosinophilia known as eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, which was reminiscent of the toxic oil syndrome in Spain in 1981.

Eosinophils play an important role in asthma as the number of accumulated eosinophils corresponds to the severity of asthmatic reaction. Eosinophilia in mice models are shown to be associated with high interleukin-5 levels. Furthermore, mucosal bronchial biopsies conducted on patients with diseases such as asthma have been found to have higher levels of interleukin-5 leading to higher levels of eosinophils. The infiltration of eosinophils at these high concentrations causes an inflammatory reaction. This ultimately leads to airway remodelling and difficulty of breathing.

Eosinophils can also cause tissue damage in the lungs of asthmatic patients. High concentrations of eosinophil major basic protein and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin that approach cytotoxic levels are observed at degranulation sites in the lungs as well as in the asthmatic sputum.

===Treatment===
Treatments used to combat autoimmune diseases and conditions caused by eosinophils include:
*corticosteroids ‚Äì promote apoptosis. Numbers of eosinophils in blood are rapidly reduced
*monoclonal antibody therapy ‚Äì e.g., mepolizumab or reslizumab against IL-5, prevents eosinophilopoiesis, or benralizumab against IL-5 receptor, which eliminates eosinophils through ADCC
*antagonists of leukotriene synthesis or receptors
*imatinib (STI571) ‚Äì inhibits PDGF-BB in hypereosinophilic leukemia

Monoclonal antibodies such as dupilumab and lebrikizumab target IL-13 and its receptor, which reduces eosinophilic inflammation in patients with asthma due to lowering the number of adhesion molecules present for eosinophils to bind to, thereby decreasing inflammation. Mepolizumab and benralizumab are other treatment options that target the alpha subunit of the IL-5 receptor, thereby inhibiting its function and reducing the number of developing eosinophils as well as the number of eosinophils leading to inflammation through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and eosinophilic apoptosis. Lysosomotropic agents are an efficient means to target the lysosome-like eosinophil granules inducing eosinophil apoptosis.

== Animal studies ==
Within the fat (adipose) tissue of CCR2 deficient mice, there is an increased number of eosinophils, greater alternative macrophage activation, and a propensity towards type 2 cytokine expression. Furthermore, this effect was exaggerated when the mice became obese from a high fat diet.
Mouse models of eosinophilia from mice infected with T. canis showed an increase in IL-5 mRNA in mice spleen. Mouse models of asthma from OVA show a higher TH2 response. When mice are administered IL-12 to induce the TH1 response, the TH2 response becomes suppressed, showing that mice without TH2 cytokines are significantly less likely to express asthma symptoms.

<doc id="238731" wikidata="Q730046" url="?curid=238731" title="Goo Goo Dolls">
<text>The Goo Goo Dolls are an American rock band based in Buffalo, New York, composed of lead vocalist and guitarist John Rzeznik, bassist and vocalist Robby Takac, as well as several rotating members since its formation in 1986.

After starting off as a cover band and then developing a punk sound, Goo Goo Dolls experienced mainstream success following the 1995 release of their breakthrough single, &quot;Name&quot;. The band is renowned for their 1998 single, &quot;Iris&quot;, which spent 11 consecutive months on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and peaked atop the Hot 100 Airplay chart for 18 weeks. In October 2012, &quot;Iris&quot; placed first on &quot;Billboard&quot;‚Ä≥s &quot;Top 100 Pop Songs 1992‚Äì2012&quot; chart. Other notable singles include &quot;Slide&quot;, &quot;Black Balloon&quot;, and &quot;Broadway&quot; from &quot;Dizzy Up the Girl&quot; (1998); &quot;Here Is Gone&quot; from &quot;Gutterflower&quot; (2002); and &quot;Better Days&quot;, &quot;Give a Little Bit&quot;, and &quot;Stay with You&quot; from &quot;Let Love In&quot; (2006).

The band has had seven top-40 singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, which includes three top tens. They have sold 15 million records worldwide, and received four Grammy Award nominations.

== History ==

=== Origins and early music (1986‚Äì1993) ===
The band&#x27;s original lineup included John Rzeznik (guitar, vocals), Robby Takac (bass, vocals), and George Tutuska (drums, percussion). Takac and Tutuska had been long-time friends in school and met Rzeznik while he was playing in the band The Beaumonts with Takac&#x27;s cousin, Paul Takac, and close friend Michael Harvey who was the inspiration for the band. In 1999 Rolling Stone reported the trio picked their name from a &quot;True Detective&quot; ad for a toy called a Goo Goo Doll. In 2022, Rzeznik said he didn&#x27;t remember how they picked the name. &quot;We had a gig and so we had to come up with some kind of a name just to play the show&quot;, Rzeznik said. &quot;It&#x27;s kind of a stupid name.&quot;

The band started out playing covers, but went on to develop a punk sound. With Takac as their lead singer, the band released their first album, &quot;Goo Goo Dolls,&quot; in 1987 on Mercenary Records, but was picked up in 1988 by Celluloid Records, a larger record company. They played around Buffalo&#x27;s underground music circuit and across the country opening for punk bands such as Gang Green, SNFU, Dag Nasty, Bad Religion, Mot√∂rhead, ALL, The Dead Milkmen, Doughboys, Big Drill Car, The Gun Club, Uniform Choice, The Dickies, and DRI and playing with fellow Buffalo bands. The band released its second album, &quot;Jed&quot;, in 1989.

The band released its third album, &quot;Hold Me Up&quot;, in 1990 and featured Rzeznik as the lead vocalist on five tracks, including the single &quot;There You Are&quot;‚Äîas well as their then-concert favorite, &quot;Two Days in February&quot;. After being embraced by local college radio and punk scenes (including such venues as CBGB), the Goo Goo Dolls incorporated elements of heavy metal, pop rock, and punk rock into the album. In 1991, the song &quot;I&#x27;m Awake Now&quot; was recorded for the soundtrack of &quot;Freddy&#x27;s Dead: The Final Nightmare&quot;.

&quot;Superstar Car Wash&quot;, released in 1993, received significant media attention. The critical success and encouraging sales of their last album resulted in a larger budget from Metal Blade Records. The album was partially recorded at Metalworks Studios in Mississauga, Ontario. The single &quot;We Are the Normal&quot;, co-written with Paul Westerberg of The Replacements, Westerburg providing the lyrics, received a major push toward play on college and independent radio, and its video was displayed on MTV&#x27;s 120 Minutes program. &quot;Fallin&#x27; Down&quot; made it onto the 1993 soundtrack of Pauly Shore&#x27;s hit film &quot;Son in Law&quot;.

=== Mainstream success, &quot;A Boy Named Goo&quot;, legal issues, and Tutuska&#x27;s departure (1993‚Äì1997) ===
Just before &quot;A Boy Named Goo&quot;&#x27;s release, Tutuska was fired from the band and replaced by Mike Malinin. Prior to Tutuska&#x27;s departure, there was a payment dispute between him and Rzeznik over Tutuska&#x27;s contribution to the writing of the &quot;Superstar Car Wash&quot; single &quot;Fallin&#x27; Down&quot;. During the completion of &quot;A Boy Named Goo&quot;, Tutuska had told band management that he would not tour behind the album unless royalties were to be split evenly among the three members, a practice Tutuska said had been the band&#x27;s standard practice ever since the release of its self-titled debut in 1987. Tutuska has said that when he told Rzeznik he had not received royalties from &quot;Fallin&#x27; Down&quot;, Rzeznik admitted that he had been receiving such royalties for two years.

&quot;A Boy Named Goo&quot;, released in 1995, had a catchy rock sound, and became one of the most successful alternative rock albums of the mid-1990s. &quot;A Boy Named Goo&quot; became the first album in Metal Blade history to achieve double-platinum status. This success, however, proved bittersweet, as the band found themselves in a legal battle with Metal Blade. The band filed suit against Metal Blade, claiming they had not earned any royalties from their album&#x27;s sales, which was attributed to a &quot;grossly unfair, one-sided and unenforceable contract&quot; which had been signed by the band in 1987. The two sides reached a settlement which had the band signed to the Metal Blade&#x27;s distributing label, Warner Bros. Records, under which the band released their sixth album, &quot;Dizzy Up the Girl&quot;, in 1998.

The Goo Goo Dolls experienced mainstream success following the 1995 release of their breakthrough single, &quot;Name&quot;. The success of &quot;Name&quot; marked a fundamental change in the band&#x27;s sound from alternative rock to a more mainstream, adult-oriented direction; this disappointed many of the original fans of the band. &quot;Name&quot; made the band popular, and led to guest appearances on &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; and &quot;Charmed.

=== &quot;Dizzy Up the Girl&quot; and &quot;Gutterflower&quot; (1997‚Äì2005) ===
Rzeznik was approached to write a song for the &quot;City of Angels&quot; soundtrack, and the end product was &quot;Iris&quot;. This song continued the band&#x27;s fame, as it stayed on top of &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Airplay charts for a record-breaking 18 weeks and spent 4 weeks at No. 1 on Billboard&#x27;s Pop Songs chart. Iris held the record for the most weeks on the radio for almost 22 years before The Weeknd released &quot;Blinding Lights&quot; and broke the long-standing record on August 22, 2020. Shortly after Iris was released in 1998, it was nominated for three Grammys. According to several interviews with Rzeznik, he was experiencing serious bouts of writer&#x27;s block when he was approached, and was on the verge of quitting the band days before he wrote the song.

&quot;Iris&quot; was included on the quintuple-platinum &quot;Dizzy Up the Girl&quot;, considered their most successful album, and was among top-ten hits &quot;Slide&quot;, &quot;Black Balloon&quot;, &quot;Broadway&quot;, and &quot;Dizzy&quot; from the same album. In 2001, the Goos released their first ever compilation CD, &quot;What I Learned About Ego, Opinion, Art &amp; Commerce&quot;. Next, &quot;Gutterflower&quot; (2002) achieved gold certification, producing the hits &quot;Here Is Gone&quot;, &quot;Sympathy&quot;, and &quot;Big Machine&quot;. On July 4, 2004, the band performed a free concert in Buffalo, playing through a deluge of rain that can be seen on the DVD released later that year. The DVD also contained a studio version of the Goo Goo Dolls&#x27; cover of &quot;Give a Little Bit&quot; by Supertramp. The single reached the top of the Adult Top 40 chart in 2005. July 4, 2004, has been proclaimed &quot;Goo Goo Dolls Day&quot; in their native Buffalo, New York. 
=== &quot;Let Love In&quot; (2005‚Äì2007) ===
In 2006, the Goo Goo Dolls marked their 20th anniversary with their new album &quot;Let Love In&quot;, which included the studio recording of &quot;Give a Little Bit&quot; as well as other top 10 radio singles &quot;Better Days&quot;, &quot;Stay with You&quot;, and &quot;Let Love In&quot;. With their third consecutive single (&quot;Let Love In&quot;) from the album, the Goo Goo Dolls hit a record 12 top 10 hits in Adult Top 40 history; upon the release of &quot;Before It&#x27;s Too Late&quot;, that total increased to 13. Goo Goo Dolls performed on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; on June 8, 2007, and at &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot; on June 22, 2007.

On June 27, 2007, the Goo Goo Dolls performed to a sold-out crowd at Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Morrison, Colorado. The entire concert was released as a DVD on the limited edition version of their 2008 release, &quot;Vol.2&quot;. Though the album has not (as of 2007) been certified by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), various music sites have asserted that it has gone gold.

=== Greatest hits albums (2007‚Äì2008) ===

On November 13, 2007, the Goo Goo Dolls released a greatest hits album entitled &quot;Greatest Hits Volume One: The Singles&quot;, which includes a new version of &quot;Name&quot; recorded and mixed by Paul David Hager, and a remix of &quot;Feel the Silence&quot; by Michael Brauer.

The band performed &quot;Better Days&quot; and &quot;Stay With You&quot; at the halftime of the Detroit Lions&#x27; 2007 Thanksgiving Day game at Ford Field, which focused on the United Way and the NFL&#x27;s commitment to youth health and fitness.

=== &quot;Something for the Rest of Us&quot; (2008‚Äì2010) ===
The Goo Goo Dolls announced recording sessions for a new album, on their official website, unrelated to their &quot;Volume Two&quot; in 2008. In addition, the band performed as part of the O2 Wireless Festival in London&#x27;s Hyde Park in the summer of 2008.

&quot;Something for the Rest of Us&quot; was released on August 31, 2010. While the album was full of the pop-rock that has sustained the band for decades, lead singer/guitarist Rzeznik&#x27;s songwriting took on a more somber, serious tone. &quot;Something for the Rest of Us&quot; included the single &quot;Home&quot;, which extended the band&#x27;s record to 14 top ten hits at the Hot AC radio format (more than any other artist in the history of that format).

The band performed a live mini-concert at the Apple Store in Manhattan, New York on December 2, 2010.
=== &quot;Magnetic&quot; and Malinin&#x27;s departure (2010‚Äì2015) ===
The album &quot;Magnetic&quot; was released on June 11, 2013 and debuted at #8 on the Billboard Top 200 Albums chart. On July 19, 2013, the band released the second single off of &quot;Magnetic&quot;, &quot;Come to Me&quot;.

In December 2013, Mike Malinin announced his departure from the band. In November 2014, Malinin sued the band for wrongful termination, claiming that he was fired after requesting paternity leave.

The Goo Goo Dolls contributed to the soundtrack of the broadway musical &quot;Finding Neverland&quot; in 2015. The soundtrack, released June 9, 2015, contained the song &quot;If the World Turned Upside Down&quot;.

=== &quot;Boxes&quot;, 20th anniversary of &quot;A Boy Named Goo&quot; and touring (2015‚Äì2017) ===
The band spent the majority of 2015 in the studio writing and recording their eleventh studio album, &quot;Boxes&quot;, at Bear Creek Studio in Woodinville, Washington. The album was released on May 6, 2016.

The Goo Goo Dolls celebrated the 20th anniversary of the release of &quot;A Boy Named Goo&quot; by releasing a special edition of the album on November 27, 2015.

Goo Goo Dolls released an exclusive vinyl box set for Record Store Day on April 22, 2017, entitled &quot;Pick Pockets, Petty Thieves, and Tiny Victories (1987‚Äì1995)&quot;.

=== &quot;You Should Be Happy&quot;, &quot;Miracle Pill&quot;, and Christmas album (2017‚Äì2021) ===
On May 12, 2017, Goo Goo Dolls released a five-song EP entitled &quot;You Should Be Happy&quot;. In support of the EP, the band toured throughout the summer of 2017 on the &quot;Long Way Home&quot; tour with Phillip Phillips. With 2018 marking the 20th anniversary of &quot;Dizzy Up the Girl&quot;, the band embarked on a commemorative tour where they performed the album in its entirety. Also in 2018, the band released two live albums: &quot;The Audience is This Way&quot; in June, and &quot;The Audience is That Way&quot; in November.

At the beginning of 2019, the Goo Goo Dolls announced that they were working on a twelfth studio album. On record store day (April 13, 2019), a vinyl box limited to 1000 copies under the name &quot;Topography&quot; was released.

On August 24, 2020, the band announced its first Christmas album: &quot;It&#x27;s Christmas All Over&quot;, which was released on October 30. Later that year, Rzeznik sat down with &quot;Atwood Magazine&quot; to discuss the band&#x27;s 35th anniversary.

In May 2021, the band announced that &quot;Rarities&quot;, a double compilation featuring rare and unheard songs spanning from 1995 to 2007, would be released on June 25, 2021.

=== &quot;Chaos in Bloom&quot; (2022‚Äìpresent) ===
In a June 2021 interview published on YouTube, singer John Rzeznik revealed that the band was working on their 14th studio album, which would be released sometime in 2022. When asked about how the album differs from the band&#x27;s previous work, Rzeznik claimed that the band had decided to approach both writing and recording in an alternative way. Specifically, the band used earlier forms of production which they utilized prior to the digital era in the music industry.

In a November 2021 &quot;Spin&quot; interview, Rzeznik stated that he produced most of the album himself. He added that the album would sound more experimental than the band&#x27;s past releases, hinting that he did not believe it would receive much radio airplay. It was later confirmed that the album was entirely produced by Rzeznik.

On June 27, 2022, the band officially announced on their Facebook page the title of their new album, &quot;Chaos in Bloom&quot;, as well as the first single off it, &quot;Yeah, I Like You&quot;. The latter premiered on July 1, 2022.

In February 2023, Goo Goo Dolls announced their North America tour.

In October 2012, &quot;Iris&quot; was ranked number one on &quot;Billboard&quot;‚Ä≥s &quot;Top 100 Pop Songs 1992‚Äì2012&quot; chart, which ranked the top songs of the first 20 years of the Mainstream Top 40/Pop Songs chart. The list also featured the Goo Goo Dolls&#x27; hits &quot;Slide&quot;, ranking at number nine, and &quot;Name&quot; at number 24. The Goo Goo Dolls are the only musicians to have three songs on the list, two breaking the top 10 and all three falling within the top 25. They are also the only musicians that have back to back singles (Iris, 1998 and Slide, 1999) featured on the list.
