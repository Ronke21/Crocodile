<text>[[Feral child]]ren, children who have lived from a young age without human contact, appear in mythological and fictional works, usually as human characters who have been raised by animals. Often their dual heritage is a benefit to them, protecting them from the corrupting influence of human society, such as in Tarzan. It also may be permitting the development and expression of their own animal nature, for example in Enkidu, or providing access to the wisdom and lore by which animals survive in the wild (Mowgli).

In most tales, the child is lost or abandoned, such as in Tarzan and Romulus and Remus respectively. They are then found and adopted in a chance encounter with a sympathetic wild animal. In some stories, the child chooses to abandon human society or even refuses to enter society altogether. The child usually returns to civilization, but may decide to return again to life in the wild. In some cases, they find themselves trapped between worlds unable to enter entirely into either human society or animal society.

<doc id="238737" wikidata="Q166006" url="?curid=238737" title="The Lemonheads">
<text>The Lemonheads are an American alternative rock band formed in Boston in 1986 by Evan Dando, Ben Deily, and Jesse Peretz. Dando has remained the band&#x27;s only constant member. After their initial punk-influenced releases and tours as an independent/college rock band in the late 1980s, the Lemonheads&#x27; popularity with a mass audience grew in 1992 with the major label album &quot;It&#x27;s a Shame about Ray&quot;, which was produced, engineered, and mixed by The Robb Brothers (Bruce Robb, Dee, and Joe). This was followed by a cover of Simon and Garfunkel&#x27;s &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot;, which eventually became one of the band&#x27;s most successful singles. The Lemonheads were active until 1997 before going on hiatus, but reformed with a new lineup in 2005 and released &quot;The Lemonheads&quot; the following year. The band released its latest album, &quot;Varshons 2&quot;, in February 2019.

Since its formation, recording and touring lineups of the band have included co-founders Deily and Peretz, John Strohm (Blake Babies), Doug Trachten, Corey Loog Brennan, Byron Hoagland (Folks on Fire), Ben Daughtrey (Squirrel Bait), Juliana Hatfield (Blake Babies), Nic Dalton (Godstar, Sneeze, the Plunderers), David Ryan (Fuzzy), Patrick &quot;Murph&quot; Murphy (Dinosaur Jr.), George Berz (Dinosaur Jr., Gobblehoof), Josh Lattanzi, Bill Gibson (the Eastern Dark), Mark &#x27;Budola&#x27; Newman, Kenny Lyon, Vess Ruhtenberg, Devon Ashley, Karl Alvarez and Bill Stevenson (Descendents), P. David Hazel, Farley Glavin, and various others.

==History==

===Early years (1986–1991)===
Evan Dando, Ben Deily and Jesse Peretz formed the Lemonheads as teenagers at the Commonwealth School in Boston. The band was originally called the Whelps, until inspiration came from a brand of candy, which Dando noted was &quot;sweet on the inside and sour on the outside.&quot; The band recorded and self-released the 7-inch EP &quot;Laughing All the Way to the Cleaners.&quot; The band&#x27;s first show was played on August 19, 1986.

After high school, Dando enrolled at Skidmore College but could not maintain his grades and dropped out to pursue a musical career. Having signed to local label Taang! Records, the Lemonheads released the albums &quot;Hate Your Friends&quot; (1987), &quot;Creator&quot; (1988), and &quot;Lick (1989)&quot; with Deily and Dando sharing lead vocals and songwriting duties. Initially they also shared lead guitar and drumming duties as well, but when this became unworkable, they hired drummers such as Doug Trachten, John Strohm, and Mark Natola to fill in the lineup. As all three albums were compiled from various recording sessions from 1986 onward, the lineups on each album varied considerably from song to song. The band enjoyed a good deal of college radio airplay and were popular in the burgeoning indie rock scene, up until Deily left the band in 1989. Dando then recruited David Ryan on drums, and Corey Loog Brennan as a second guitarist, and signed to major label Atlantic Records, releasing the album &quot;Lovey&quot; in August 1990. Straddling punk rock, country music and heavy metal, &quot;Lovey&quot; was released a year before the commercial explosion of grunge, and failed to chart or produce any songs with serious airplay.

===Breakthrough and height of fame (1992–1997)===
Dando cut his losses and flew to Australia to write some songs with friends Nic Dalton and Tom Morgan. These songs formed the basis for &quot;It&#x27;s a Shame about Ray&quot;, the Lemonheads&#x27; breakthrough album. In the intervening time, Jesse Peretz had left music, and had taken up a career in photography and film; he would remain as the band photographer, and would eventually go on to direct music videos, TV shows, and feature films. Replacing Peretz in the band was Juliana Hatfield, who provided bass and backing vocals. Hatfield would leave the band shortly after recording the album to found her own band, the Juliana Hatfield Three, and would be replaced on bass by Nic Dalton. A cover of &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot; (recorded to promote the video release and the 25th anniversary of &quot;The Graduate&quot;) was released as a single and got them the most exposure they had had so far. This cover was also used in the film &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World 2&quot; and in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s 2013 film &quot;The Wolf of Wall Street&quot;. When the &quot;Ray&quot; album was reissued, the track was tacked on to the end. The band enjoyed some success on college radio as well as mainstream exposure. The title track, &quot;It&#x27;s a Shame About Ray&quot;, also saw commercial success. During 1992–1993, Dando&#x27;s face graced many magazine covers, and he was included in &quot;People&quot;″s 50 Most Beautiful People list.

Now consisting of Dando, Dalton, and Ryan, the band officially renamed themselves from &quot;Lemonheads&quot; to &quot;the Lemonheads&quot; prior to the release of &quot;Come on Feel the Lemonheads&quot; in October 1993. Though no longer playing bass, Hatfield did appear as a backing singer on many of the tracks. The album also featured guest appearances by steel guitarist Sneaky Pete Kleinow and singers Belinda Carlisle and Rick James. This was a successful album with tracks such as &quot;Big Gay Heart&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s About Time.&quot; The band enjoyed modest mainstream success, this time with the single &quot;Into Your Arms&quot; (their highest charting UK hit to date). Writer Robyn St. Clare made the first recording of this song in 1990 as part of Love Positions with Nic Dalton.

Dando befriended Oasis and appeared at the band&#x27;s live shows. The cracks were beginning to show, and after one particularly disjointed interview with Dando almost unable to speak, having lost his voice after smoking crack cocaine, he admitted to having a drug problem. The band went on hiatus and Dando went into rehab.

In 1996, Dando re-formed the Lemonheads with a completely new lineup, including drummer Murph (formerly of Dinosaur Jr.), bassist Bill Gibson (formerly of the Eastern Dark), and guitarist John Strohm (formerly of the Blake Babies; Strohm had also played drums with the Lemonheads during their early years). This band produced another Lemonheads album, &quot;Car Button Cloth&quot;. While featuring jangly guitar songs such as &quot;If I Could Talk I&#x27;d Tell You,&quot; this set also showed off the darker side of Dando&#x27;s writing.

The band contributed to &quot;Schoolhouse Rock! Rocks&quot;, a 1996 tribute album for &quot;Schoolhouse Rock!&quot; creator Thomas G. Yohe, which contained remakes of many popular &quot;Schoolhouse Rock!&quot; songs – the Lemonheads offered their take on &quot;My Hero Zero.&quot; Previously, the band had contributed to a Kiss tribute album, recording Kiss&#x27; 1977 song &quot;Plaster Caster&quot; for &quot;Kiss My Ass: Classic Kiss Regrooved&quot; (1994).

The band toured successfully in 1997 and played a final gig at the UK&#x27;s Reading Festival. Following a cameo line in the BBC&#x27;s all-star cover version of Lou Reed&#x27;s &quot;Perfect Day&quot; (which reached number one in the UK Singles Chart), Dando continued to play live solo shows.

===Hiatus (1998–2004)===
Atlantic released &quot;The Best of the Lemonheads&quot; in August 1998. Through 1998 and 2004 Evan Dando undertook some solo tours performing the band&#x27;s songs but an official reunion was never confirmed. During this time, Dando released a live album &quot;Live at the Brattle Theatre&quot; in 2001, and a solo album in 2003, titled &quot;Baby I&#x27;m Bored&quot;. He also co-wrote the song &quot;The Last High&quot; with Courtney Taylor-Taylor of the Dandy Warhols for the album &quot;Welcome to the Monkey House&quot; by the Dandy Warhols.

===Reunion (2005–present)===
 After a nine-year hiatus, the band reformed in the summer of 2005 with a recording lineup bolstered by Bill Stevenson and Karl Alvarez, members of Descendents. The live lineup during this period fluctuated, with Stevenson and George Berz (Dinosaur Jr.) both sitting in on drums during 2005, while Josh Lattanzi—chiefly known for his work with Ben Kweller—has frequently taken on bass duties for live shows.

On September 14 and 15, 2005, Dando, Stevenson and Lattanzi performed two shows at Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire in London as part of the ATP Don&#x27;t Look Back series, where they played &quot;It&#x27;s a Shame About Ray&quot; in its entirety.

In April 2006, the Lemonheads were signed to Vagrant Records. The album, simply titled &quot;The Lemonheads&quot;, was released on September 26, 2006, in the United States and one day earlier in the UK; the album featured special guests Garth Hudson and J Mascis on select tracks. To promote the album Dando toured the UK, Europe and US in late 2006 with a band consisting of Vess Ruhtenberg (bass) and Devon Ashley (drums) of the Pieces. In the US, they toured with Vietnam and Hymns (band) as support. The same lineup toured again in 2007 and 2008. The recording lineup of Dando, Alvarez and Stevenson played live for the first time together on a 20-date US tour in late 2007.

While the Lemonheads reformed, co-founder Deily received a degree from Harvard University. He currently works as an Associate Creative Director in the advertising industry. His power pop/punk band, Varsity Drag, completed a 25-city European tour during January and February 2007, performing their own material alongside several Deily compositions from the first four Lemonheads releases. Varsity Drag continues to perform periodically in the Boston Area.

A deluxe reissue of Lemonheads&#x27; 1992 album &quot;It&#x27;s a Shame About Ray&quot; was released in March 2008 (US) and April 2008 (UK) on Rhino Records, which features demos, B-sides and a DVD issue of the previously VHS-only &quot;Two Weeks In Australia&quot;, featuring footage from the band&#x27;s Australian tour in the wake of their breakthrough album&#x27;s release. To promote the reissue, the lineup of Dando, Ruhtenberg and Ashley performed the album in full at a number of gigs between March and May 2008. Later in 2008 the band toured again in Europe with Vess Ruhtenberg and P. David Hazel (drums) of Beta Male.

On April 23, 2008, at the inaugural &quot;NME&quot; US Awards ceremony at the El Rey in Los Angeles, Dando received the classic album award for &quot;It&#x27;s A Shame About Ray&quot;, and also performed &quot;My Drug Buddy&quot; and the album&#x27;s title track acoustically. According to reports, soon after receiving the award, Dando deposited it into a garbage can, telling a minder &quot;I don&#x27;t want this&quot;.

On June 23, 2009, the Lemonheads released &quot;Varshons&quot; – a collection of eleven covers, including tracks by Gram Parsons, Wire, GG Allin, and Christina Aguilera. The album also featured actress Liv Tyler performing a duet on Leonard Cohen&#x27;s &quot;Hey That&#x27;s No Way To Say Goodbye&quot;. Despite several websites reporting a release date of September 13, 2008, the album was not released on this date. Later, in a blog post on the band&#x27;s MySpace page, Dando hinted at a March 2009 release. On March 27, 2009, it was announced that Varshons would be released on June 23 on The End Records.

In an August 2007 interview, drummer Bill Stevenson stated that he was going to produce the Lemonheads&#x27; ninth album of original material. As of August 2010, however, announcements of a new album have not yet been released.

In September 2010 the Lemonheads announced an Australian tour playing all thirteen songs from the 1992 album &quot;It&#x27;s a Shame about Ray&quot;, plus a selection of songs from other albums.

On February 7, 2012, the Lemonheads will release Hotel Sessions on Hall of Records/Breath of Saltwater – an intimate recording documenting a Sunday night that Evan Dando spent recording new songs with just an acoustic guitar (and some revealing commentary) in a hotel room in Bondi Beach, Australia. The 14 songs include some that never made it to an official Lemonheads album, but Dando says, &quot;the &quot;Into Your Arms&quot; I did here is better than the one on the album (I like it anyway).&quot;

The Lemonheads completed a 9-week U.S. tour in spring of 2012 playing all thirteen songs from the 1992 album &quot;It&#x27;s a Shame about Ray&quot;, plus a selection of songs from other albums. Lead singer Evan Dando recruited drummer Chuck Treece and former Taking Back Sunday lead guitarist Fred Mascherino to play bass.

Juliana Hatfield rejoined the Lemonheads for a late 2012 tour supporting the Psychedelic Furs.

On September 17, 2012, Ryan Adams tweeted that he would be playing drums on a new &#x27;punker sounding&#x27; Lemonheads album as well as producing it. He also announced that Evan Dando would be joined on the record by Juliana Hatfield and, for the first time since 1989&#x27;s Lick, co-founder and original co-songwriter Ben Deily. Like the earlier Bill Stevenson produced sessions, however, no album was released.

The Lemonheads played a seven-date tour in Ireland and the UK in October 2015.

On August 14, 2017, Atlantic Records divested the Lemonheads&#x27; back catalog to Fire Records, which released several of the band&#x27;s albums in the UK.

A second album of covers (the band&#x27;s first album in a decade), titled &quot;Varshons 2&quot;, was released in 2019.

==Musical style==
Musically, the band has been classified as alternative rock, grunge, jangle pop, power pop, and pop-punk.

== Personnel ==
During the earliest years, the band consisted of Evan Dando, Ben Deily, and Jesse Peretz. Dando and Deily shared singing and songwriting duties; when recording or performing live each would sing and play guitar on their own compositions while the other would play drums. When the arrangement became unworkable, they hired additional drummers including Doug Trachten and John Strohm. On most of the first three albums (released by independent label TAANG!), songs from various recording sessions and live tracks are mixed, so instrumentation varies considerably from track-to-track depending on who was in the band when the tracks were recorded. CD versions of these albums were also released with bonus tracks from even later lineups of the band.

When Deily quit the band in 1989, Dando replaced him with guitarist Corey Loog Brennan and drummer Mark Natola. Natola would be replaced by drummer David Ryan prior to the band&#x27;s first major label album, &quot;Lovey&quot;. Following the recording of &quot;Lovey&quot;, founding bass player Jesse Peretz left the band to pursue a career in photography and filmmaking, and Brennan left to concentrate on his career as a college professor.

On their breakout album, &quot;It&#x27;s a Shame About Ray&quot;, Juliana Hatfield had joined on bass guitar and backing vocals. She would remain the backing vocalist for the follow-up album &quot;Come on Feel the Lemonheads&quot;, but would be replaced on bass guitar by Nic Dalton. John Strohm, who had previously played drums with the band during their early years, toured with the band as a second guitarist in support of these albums.

Starting with 1996&#x27;s &quot;Car Button Cloth&quot; and continuing through the present, the band membership has been fluid, with the name the Lemonheads generally being used by whomever Evan Dando had recruited to record and/or play with at the time. Their last official release was 2019&#x27;s collection of cover songs &quot;Varshons 2&quot;, which followed on from their prior release, 2009&#x27;s &quot;Varshons&quot;. Several announcements of albums of new material or tours involving any number of musicians have been announced over the years since then, most recently a 2012 project involving Ben Deily, Juliana Hatfield, and Ryan Adams, but as yet no major recordings or substantial tours have materialized.

Below is an approximate timeline of membership in the Lemonheads. Other than Evan Dando, the band has rarely had a stable lineup. The timeline below shows only members which were primary recording or touring members. It does not include guest musicians, or ephemeral lineups which only appeared on stage under the Lemonheads moniker for one-off shows or brief appearances. Dates of membership are approximate based on known shows and recordings.

<doc id="238739" wikidata="Q593366" url="?curid=238739" title="Collective Soul">
<text>Collective Soul is an American rock band originally from Stockbridge, Georgia. Now based in Atlanta, the group consists of the brothers Ed (lead vocalist) and Dean Roland (rhythm guitarist), Will Turpin (bassist), Johnny Rabb (drummer), and Jesse Triplett (lead guitarist). Formed in 1992, the original lineup consisted of the Roland brothers, bassist David Neal, guitarist Ross Childress, and drummer Shane Evans. Collective Soul released their &quot;Hints, Allegations, and Things Left Unsaid&quot; album on the independent label Rising Storm Records in 1993. The band went from obscurity to popularity that year after the album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Shine&quot; received regional radio play. Around the same time, Turpin replaced Neal on bass. The album was then re-released in 1994 by the major label Atlantic Records; thus, &quot;Shine&quot; became a national hit as it peaked at No. 1 on the Mainstream Rock and No. 4 on the Mainstream Top 40 chart.

Collective Soul released a self-titled album in March 1995. Considered by Ed Roland to be the band&#x27;s &quot;true debut album&quot;, &quot;Collective Soul&quot; spent 76 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and went triple-platinum, becoming the band&#x27;s highest-selling album. The singles &quot;December&quot;, &quot;The World I Know&quot;, and &quot;Where the River Flows&quot; each reached No. 1 on the Mainstream Rock chart. About two years later, Collective Soul released &quot;Disciplined Breakdown&quot;. Although not as successful in sales as their previous two albums, &quot;Disciplined Breakdown&quot; contained two No. 1 Mainstream Rock chart hits with &quot;Precious Declaration&quot; and &quot;Listen&quot;. The band released a fourth studio album, &quot;Dosage&quot;, in 1999. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Heavy&quot;, spent a then record-breaking 15 weeks on the top spot of the Mainstream Rock chart.

The band released &quot;Blender&quot; in 2000. It was the final album with their most well-known lineup as lead guitarist Childress left the band in 2001. Collective Soul established their own label, El Music Group (which was later renamed to Fuzze-Flex Records), prior to releasing &quot;Youth&quot; in 2004. Original drummer Evans then departed from the band at the end of 2005. Collective Soul released five additional albums between 2005 and 2023: &quot;Afterwords&quot; (2007), &quot;Rabbit&quot; (2009), &quot;See What You Started by Continuing&quot; (2015), &quot;Blood&quot; (2019), and &quot;Vibrating&quot; (2022). The band then released their first double album in 2024, &quot;Here to Eternity&quot;.

==History==

===Early years===
Before forming Collective Soul, singer Ed Roland studied music composition and guitar at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts. Since the mid-1980s, Roland was involved in Atlanta&#x27;s underground music scene making demos and performing. He also worked at Real 2 Reel Studios in Stockbridge, which was owned by Will Turpin&#x27;s father, Bill Turpin. Roland&#x27;s duties were producing, mixing, and engineering for local Atlanta artists.

Roland recruited keyboard player and backing vocalist Christopher Dykes, drummer Tony Caporale, and bassist Skip Godwin to play live in clubs and showcase for A&amp;R personnel from various record companies. At this time the group was simply known as &quot;Ed-E&quot;. They played several local shows, played a part in a CBS &quot;Movie of the Week&quot;, and were guests on the local Atlanta television program &quot;Music Peachtree Style&quot; (where local Atlanta-based artists were interviewed and profiled). That initial version of the &quot;Ed-E&quot; band dissolved in the mid-to-late 1980s due to incompatible musical tastes among other differences. Roland then formed the band &quot;Marching Two-Step&quot; which included vocalist Michele Rhea Caplinger, drummer Shane Evans, bassist Godwin (from Roland&#x27;s previous band), and keyboardist Matt Serletic. Although the band didn&#x27;t release any official material, they played in various clubs and also opened for The Psychedelic Furs at one point. They then disbanded after not finding success, and Roland subsequently released an independent solo album entitled &quot;Ed-E Roland&quot; in 1991. Overall, Roland&#x27;s early attempts to be signed to a recording contract by a label faced rejections.

Caplinger would become a music industry publicist and also worked with the major label Atlantic Records. She was later appointed executive director of the Atlanta Chapter of the Recording Academy in 2000. Serletic would go on to become a Grammy Award-winning producer for Matchbox Twenty, Blessid Union of Souls, Edwin McCain, and numerous other artists, and also landed executive positions with record companies. Roland continued to remain friends with both individuals, and even worked alongside them in the future.

===1992–1994: &quot;Hints, Allegations, and Things Left Unsaid&quot;, signing to Atlantic Records, and initial exposure===
After the demise of Roland&#x27;s previous music collaborations, he enlisted musicians to record an album in a basement. The group made for the demo took its name (&quot;Collective Soul&quot;) from a phrase in &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;, with Roland explaining that &quot;we&#x27;re not preaching Ayn Rand, objectivism, egoism, or anything...we just dug the name.&quot; Roland initially intended to sell the songs to a publishing company and had no immediate plans of forming a band out of it. The demo was then submitted to 88.5 WRAS. Amy Staehling, host of the &quot;Georgia Music Show&quot; at Georgia State University&#x27;s 100,000 watt student radio station in Atlanta, added the song &quot;Shine&quot; to the local rotation. It was an instant listener favorite. The demo was also passed along to 101.1 WJRR in Orlando, Florida which began playing &quot;Shine&quot; too, soon to be its most requested song. Amidst the surprise popularity, Roland agreed to perform live shows. He enlisted his brother Dean Roland on rhythm guitar, Shane Evans (from Marching Two-Step) on drums, David Neal on bass, and Ross Childress on lead guitar, in what would be the first official lineup of Collective Soul. Atlantic Records took note of the popularity of &quot;Shine&quot; and subsequently signed them to a contract. Around the same time, due to personality conflicts, Neal was replaced on bass by Will Turpin. He initially provided percussion on one of the debut album&#x27;s songs, and his father Bill owned the studio that Ed Roland previously worked at.

Upon Collective Soul&#x27;s signing, Atlantic wished to capitalize on the band&#x27;s success and quickly re-released the 1993 demo &quot;Hints, Allegations, and Things Left Unsaid&quot; as their first studio album in 1994. Although reluctant to have the unpolished demo represent their new lineup, Collective Soul gained international recognition and double-platinum status with their debut, which peaked at No. 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;Shine&quot; had topped the rock charts and also peaked at No. 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, while the second single &quot;Breathe&quot; peaked at No. 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock chart. The band quickly began work on what they would consider their true debut record and were invited to perform at Woodstock 1994. They toured extensively across North America, and also served as an opener for Aerosmith in late 1994.

===1995–1999: Continued mainstream success, &quot;Collective Soul&quot;, &quot;Disciplined Breakdown&quot;, and &quot;Dosage&quot;===
The group&#x27;s self-titled second album was issued the following year. It was certified RIAA triple platinum and logged a 76-week run on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Notable singles from the LP &quot;Collective Soul&quot; included Mainstream Rock and Modern Rock charts No. 1 hits &quot;December&quot;, &quot;Where the River Flows&quot;, and &quot;The World I Know&quot;, along with the No. 2 hit &quot;Gel&quot; and the No. 8 hit &quot;Smashing Young Man&quot;. During the album&#x27;s release, the band was the opener for Van Halen for three months. Afterwards, they embarked on their own tour as headliners.

Following a split with their manager, Collective Soul found their tour dates canceled and were called into the courtroom to face a legal battle that lasted into 1996, presumably with said ex-manager Bill Richardson. While the legal battles continued, the band went to a cabin, in the middle of of cow pasture in Stockbridge, and began recording. They recorded into a computer their impromptu efforts of songs Roland penned, and these became &quot;Disciplined Breakdown&quot;. The legal case was eventually settled, and both parties were instructed not to discuss the outcome.

&quot;Disciplined Breakdown&quot;, released in 1997, did not sell as well as their previous records despite debuting higher on the charts. The album eventually achieved platinum certification, and produced two more No. 1 singles on the Mainstream Rock chart: &quot;Precious Declaration&quot; and &quot;Listen&quot;, along with No. 11 hit &quot;Blame&quot;. The album eventually peaked at No. 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

Collective Soul took a break from touring and had only played a handful of dates throughout 1998. They had instead focused on recording. The band&#x27;s fourth album was 1999&#x27;s platinum certified &quot;Dosage&quot;. The first single &quot;Heavy&quot; set a new high mark for 15 weeks at No. 1 on the Mainstream Rock chart. Singles such as &quot;Run&quot;, &quot;No More, No Less&quot;, and &quot;Tremble for My Beloved&quot; gained notable positions on the rock charts as well. The album was produced by Anthony J. Resta, known for his work with Duran Duran and others. The band also performed at the Woodstock 1999 festival.

===2000–2003: &quot;Blender&quot; and departure from Atlantic Records===
The group then released their fifth studio album, &quot;Blender&quot;, in October 2000. It did not sell as well as previous albums, although the first single &quot;Why, Pt. 2&quot; reached No. 2 on the Mainstream Rock chart. They achieved additional hits with &quot;Vent&quot; and &quot;Perfect Day&quot;, the latter being a duet between Roland and Elton John. The album became RIAA certified gold. The album was their second effort with Resta producing.

In 2001, Collective Soul released their greatest hits compilation, &quot;Seven Year Itch: Greatest Hits 1994–2001&quot; (the title being stylized as &quot;7even Year Itch&quot;), which featured two new songs, the single &quot;Next Homecoming&quot; and &quot;Energy&quot;. The record marked the end of the group&#x27;s contract with Atlantic Records and the departure of lead guitarist Childress due to private personal differences. The band promoted their longtime guitar technician, Joel Kosche from Jovian Storm, to be the new lead guitarist.

===2004–2009: Formation of El Music Group, &quot;Youth&quot;, &quot;Afterwords&quot;, and &quot;Rabbit&quot;===
In 2004, Collective Soul created their independent label El Music Group, which allowed the band greater control over the production and distribution of their music. In November of that year, they released their sixth studio album, &quot;Youth&quot;, which debuted at No. 66 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Due to personal issues, additional drum tracks on the album were by session musician Ryan Hoyle, who would play a more prominent place in the band increasingly. &quot;Counting the Days&quot; was the first and most successful single, as it peaked at No. 8 on the Mainstream Rock chart. The second single &quot;Better Now&quot; received significant airplay on the Adult Top 40 chart as it peaked at No. 9 and was used in commercials for the cereal Special K. The third single &quot;How Do You Love&quot; peaked at No. 16 on the Adult Top 40 chart. Overall, the resultant US and Canadian tours lasted over two years.

In May 2005, they released an eight-song acoustic EP compilation titled &quot;From the Ground Up&quot;, which had acoustic versions of past favorites, plus a new track &quot;Youth&quot;. Collective Soul performed two shows with the Atlanta Symphony Youth Orchestra on April 23 and 24, 2005. A DVD and double disc CD of the performances, entitled &quot;&quot; was released in February 2006. At the end of 2005, Evans was dismissed from the band due to extensive drug use. His place was filled by Hoyle, who was in the studio for the 2004 &quot;Youth&quot; album and had substituted on different occasions for Evans.

Collective Soul&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;Afterwords&quot;, was released in August 2007. It was co-produced again by Resta who also contributed synthesizers, percussion, and lead guitar on the song &quot;Bearing Witness&quot;. The band made a deal in the US with Target stores, making it the &quot;exclusive physical retailer&quot; of &quot;Afterwords&quot; for one year. The album was immediately available in digital form on iTunes. The record debuted at No. 25 on the Comprehensive Albums chart (as albums available only from a single retailer were ineligible for the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at the time). &quot;Billboard&quot; would later amend this rule due to similar successes of other artists via similar agreements.

The Adult Top 40 pop-rock single &quot;Hollywood&quot; was released in May. It became the theme song for the hit T.V. show &quot;American Idol&quot;. The band then made an appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; on August 31 to promote the album where they performed &quot;Hollywood&quot;. They were also the musical guest on &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot;. The second single &quot;All That I Know&quot; was released in November and charted lower than the prior single. In 2008, drummer Hoyle had left the band and was replaced by Cheney Brannon.

Collective Soul released their eighth studio album on August 25, 2009, with Roadrunner Records, a subsidiary of their previous label Atlantic Records. It was officially another self-titled album but was also named &quot;Rabbit&quot; to differentiate it from the band&#x27;s 1995 self-titled release. The album debuted at No. 24 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The first single was &quot;Staring Down&quot; and the second single was &quot;Welcome All Again&quot;. &quot;Staring Down&quot; charted at No. 18 on the Adult Top 40 chart. The third single, &quot;You&quot;, also charted briefly on the Adult Top 40.

Collective Soul were inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame in September 2009. In their induction speech, Roland thanked a long list of former members and collaborators who had been involved over the past three decades, including Childress, Hoyle, and Brannon. He also invited Evans on the stage to celebrate with the band.

===2010–2020: Focus on side projects, &quot;See What You Started by Continuing&quot;, and &quot;Blood&quot;===
Collective Soul returned to El Music Group in 2010, and in December that year, the band released a re-recorded version of &quot;Tremble for My Beloved&quot; (originally from &quot;Dosage&quot;) as both a single and a video on iTunes. The video was also included on the DVD &quot;Music Videos and Performances from The Twilight Saga Soundtracks, Vol. 1&quot;. In 2012, the band embarked on the Dosage Tour, with touring member Johnny Rabb replacing Brannon on drums.

The band members were then involved with other projects. Kosche and Turpin began their own solo careers, releasing the albums &quot;Fight Years&quot; (2010) and &quot;The Lighthouse&quot; (2011) respectively. Dean Roland was a part of the rock band Magnets and Ghosts, alongside Ryan Potesta. The duo formed in 2010 and released their debut album &quot;Mass&quot; in November 2011. In 2011, Ed Roland began recording and touring with friends Christopher Alan Yates, Brian Biskey, Grant Reynolds, and Mike Rizzi. The group, Ed Roland and the Sweet Tea Project, released their debut album &quot;Devils &#x27;n Darlins&quot; on September 3, 2013.

The band kicked off their 2014 winter tour on January 15, 2014, at Belly Up in Aspen, Colorado, where lead guitarist Jesse Triplett made his live debut as a member of Collective Soul. Triplett replaced Kosche, who had been with the band since replacing original lead guitarist Childress in 2001. On February 6, Collective Soul publicly confirmed Kosche&#x27;s departure from the band. On May 27, Kosche broke his silence regarding his departure from the band, saying it was not an amicable split and that it had nothing to do with him wanting to pursue a solo career or wanting to &quot;move on in the world of music.&quot;

The band&#x27;s ninth studio album, &quot;See What You Started by Continuing&quot;, was released on October 2, 2015, by Vanguard Records and peaked at No. 25 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;This&quot;, made its premiere on July 15, 2015, at &quot;USA Today&quot;. The band then made the single as a free download on their official website. The band&#x27;s live album, &quot;Collective Soul: Live&quot;, was released on December 8, 2017, by Suretone Records. The recordings were selected by the band as their best over the course of 160 shows they performed in two years. Around this time, Collective Soul changed the name of their label from El Music Group to Fuzze-Flex Records.

In 2018, the band joined 3 Doors Down to co-headline the Rock &amp; Roll Express Tour, with support from Soul Asylum. In 2019 the band headlined the Now&#x27;s the Time Tour to celebrate their 25th anniversary, with support from Gin Blossoms.

The band&#x27;s tenth studio album, &quot;Blood&quot;, was released on June 21, 2019, and it peaked at No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Independent Albums chart. &quot;Blood&quot; was originally meant to be a double album but the band&#x27;s management had talked them out of releasing it as such. After a 14-year absence, the lead single &quot;Right as Rain&quot; marked the band&#x27;s return to the Mainstream Rock chart, as it peaked at the No. 32 spot. In August 2020, the band released a Record Store Day exclusive vinyl called &quot;Half &amp; Half&quot; featuring two cover songs (&quot;Opera Star&quot; and &quot;One I Love&quot;) and two original songs (&quot;Let Her Out&quot; and &quot;Back Again&quot;).

===2021–present: &quot;Vibrating&quot;, &quot;Here to Eternity&quot; double album, and continued career===

In 2021 and 2022, Collective Soul released the singles &quot;All Our Pieces&quot; and &quot;Cut the Cord&quot;, which were taken from the band&#x27;s then-upcoming album. Both songs were accompanied by music videos and lyric videos. Collective Soul&#x27;s eleventh studio album was then released on August 12, 2022, entitled &quot;Vibrating&quot;. Initially, songs on &quot;Vibrating&quot; were due to be released as part of the 2019 &quot;Blood&quot; album, but the band&#x27;s management discouraged the double album concept.

In February 2024, Collective Soul announced a double album titled &quot;Here to Eternity&quot;. It was notably recorded at the estate of Elvis Presley in Palm Springs, CA. A nationwide tour was also announced in support of the album, alongside Hootie &amp; the Blowfish and Edwin McCain. The album was released on May 17, 2024.

<text>Lhasa, officially the Chengguan District of Lhasa City, is the inner urban district of Lhasa City, Tibet Autonomous Region, Southwestern China.

Lhasa is the second most populous urban area on the Tibetan Plateau after Xining and, at an altitude of , Lhasa is one of the highest cities in the world. The city has been the religious and administrative capital of Tibet since the mid-17th century. It contains many culturally significant Tibetan Buddhist sites such as the Potala Palace, Jokhang Temple and Norbulingka Palaces.

==Toponymy==
Lhasa literally translates to &quot;place of gods&quot; ( , god; , place) in the Tibetan language. Chengguan literally translates to &quot;urban gateway&quot; () in the Chinese language. Ancient Tibetan documents and inscriptions demonstrate that the place was called Rasa (), which meant &quot;goat&#x27;s place&quot;, as it was a herding site. The name was changed to Lhasa, which means &quot;place of gods&quot;, upon its establishment as the capital of Tibet, and construction of the Jokhang temple was completed, which housed a holy statue of the Buddha. Lhasa is first recorded as the name, referring to the area&#x27;s temple of Jowo, in a treaty drawn up between China and Tibet in 822 C.E. In some old European maps, where Tibet is depicted, a town under the name &quot;Barantola&quot; can be come up with; this town has mostly been suggested to be Lhasa, at other times to refer to modern Bulantai/Boluntay in the western part of the Qinghai province.

== History ==
By the mid 7th century, Songtsen Gampo became the leader of the Tibetan Empire that had risen to power in the Yarlung Tsangpo River (whose lower reaches in India is known as the &quot;Brahmaputra River&quot;) Valley. After conquering the kingdom of Zhangzhung in the west, he moved the capital from the Chingwa Taktsé Castle in Chongye County (pinyin: Qióngjié Xiàn), southwest of Yarlung, to Rasa (Lhasa) where in 637 he raised the first structures on the site of what is now the Potala Palace on Mount Marpori.
In CE 639 and 641, Songtsen Gampo, who by this time had conquered the whole Tibetan region, is said to have contracted two alliance marriages, firstly to a Princess Bhrikuti of Nepal, and then, two years later, to Princess Wencheng of the Imperial Tang court. Bhrikuti is said to have converted him to Buddhism, which was also the faith attributed to his second wife Wencheng. In 641 he constructed the Jokhang (or Rasa Trülnang Tsulagkhang) and Ramoche Temples in Lhasa in order to house two Buddha statues, the Akshobhya Vajra (depicting the Buddha at the age of eight) and the Jowo Sakyamuni (depicting Buddha at the age of twelve), respectively brought to his court by the princesses. Lhasa suffered extensive damage under the reign of Langdarma in the 9th century, when the sacred sites were destroyed and desecrated and the empire fragmented.

A Tibetan tradition mentions that after Songtsen Gampo&#x27;s death in 649 C.E., Chinese troops captured Lhasa and burnt the Red Palace. Chinese and Tibetan scholars have noted that the event is mentioned neither in the Chinese annals nor in the Tibetan manuscripts of Dunhuang. Lǐ suggested that this tradition may derive from an interpolation. Tsepon W. D. Shakabpa believes that &quot;those histories reporting the arrival of Chinese troops are not correct.&quot;

From the fall of the monarchy in the 9th century to the accession of the 5th Dalai Lama, the centre of political power in the Tibetan region was not situated in Lhasa. However, the importance of Lhasa as a religious site became increasingly significant as the centuries progressed. It was known as the centre of Tibet where Padmasambhava magically pinned down the earth demoness and built the foundation of the Jokhang Temple over her heart. Islam has been present since the 11th century in what is considered to have always been a monolithically Buddhist culture. Two Tibetan Muslim communities have lived in Lhasa with distinct homes, food and clothing, language, education, trade and traditional herbal medicine.

By the 15th century, the city of Lhasa had risen to prominence following the founding of three large Gelugpa monasteries by Je Tsongkhapa and his disciples. The three monasteries are Ganden, Sera and Drepung which were built as part of the puritanical Buddhist revival in Tibet. The scholarly achievements and political know-how of this Gelugpa Lineage eventually pushed Lhasa once more to centre stage.

The 5th Dalai Lama, Lobsang Gyatso (1617–1682), unified Tibet and moved the centre of his administration to Lhasa in 1642 with the help of Güshi Khan of the Khoshut. With Güshi Khan as a largely uninvolved overlord, the 5th Dalai Lama and his intimates established a civil administration which is referred to by historians as the &quot;Lhasa state&quot;. The core leadership of this government is also referred to as the Ganden Phodrang, and Lhasa thereafter became both the religious and political capital. In 1645, the reconstruction of the Potala Palace began on Red Hill. In 1648, the &quot;Potrang Karpo&quot; (White Palace) of the Potala was completed, and the Potala was used as a winter palace by the Dalai Lama from that time onwards. The &quot;Potrang Marpo&quot; (Red Palace) was added between 1690 and 1694. The name Potala is derived from Mount Potalaka, the mythical abode of the Dalai Lama&#x27;s divine prototype, the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara. The Jokhang Temple was also greatly expanded around this time. Although some wooden carvings and lintels of the Jokhang Temple date to the 7th century, the oldest of Lhasa&#x27;s extant buildings, such as within the Potala Palace, the Jokhang and some of the monasteries and properties in the Old Quarter date to this second flowering in Lhasa&#x27;s history.

By the end of the 17th century, Lhasa&#x27;s Barkhor area formed a bustling market for foreign goods. The Jesuit missionary, Ippolito Desideri reported in 1716 that the city had a cosmopolitan community of Mongol, Chinese, Muscovite, Armenian, Kashmiri, Nepalese and Northern Indian traders. Tibet was exporting musk, gold, medicinal plants, furs and yak tails to far-flung markets, in exchange for sugar, tea, saffron, Persian turquoise, European amber and Mediterranean coral. The Qing dynasty army entered Lhasa in 1720, and the Qing government sent resident commissioners, called the Ambans, to Lhasa. On 11 November 1750, the murder of the regent by the Ambans triggered a riot in the city that left more than a hundred people killed, including the Ambans. After suppressing the rebels, Qing Qianlong Emperor reorganized the Tibetan government and set up the governing council called Kashag in Lhasa in 1751.

In January 1904, a British expeditionary force invaded and captured Lhasa during the British expedition to Tibet. The expedition&#x27;s leader, Sir Francis Younghusband negotiated the Convention Between Great Britain and Tibet with the remaining Tibetan officials after the Dalai Lama had fled to the countryside. The treaty was subsequently repudiated and was succeeded by a 1906 Anglo-Chinese treaty. All Qing troops left Lhasa after the Xinhai Lhasa turmoil in 1912.

On 2 November 1949, the local Tibetan government sent a letter to Mao Zedong (then Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party) expressing its desire for talks. Tsepon Shargyalpa and Tsejang Khenpo Tubten Gyalpo were sent as representatives, but no consensus was reached. On 7 October 1950, the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army launched the Battle of Chamdo. After the battle, the PLA ceased military operations, released all Tibetan prisoners, and expressed its hope for a settlement through peace talks. At the invitation of the Central Government, the Dalai Lama and a Tibetan government delegation traveled to Beijing for peace talks, and in April 1951, a five-member delegation headed by Ngapo-Ngawang Jigme traveled to Beijing and reached a consensus on peace talks.
In 1959, following a failed uprising, the 14th Dalai Lama and his associates fled Tibet. Lhasa remained the political, economic, cultural and religious center of Tibet. In January 1960, Lhasa City was established. In 1964, the autonomous region and Lhasa city leaders jointly formed the Lhasa City Municipal Construction Command, led from the country&#x27;s brother provinces and cities to mobilize the construction team, has built the Lhasa City YuTuo Road, KangAng East Road, NiangJe South Road, JinZhu East Road, DuoSen South Road and Beijing West Road. Lhasa local officials paved more than 100,000 square meters of asphalt. The new city center of Lhasa is three times larger than the old city center, and the population of the city has increased by more than 20,000 people. In September 1965, the Tibet Autonomous Region was established, and Lhasa became the capital of the region.

Of the 22 parks (&quot;lingka&quot;s) which surrounded the city of Lhasa, most of them over half a mile in length, where the people of Lhasa were accustomed to picnic, only three survive today: the Norbulingka, Dalai Lama&#x27;s Summer Palace, constructed by the 7th Dalai Lama; a small part of the Shugtri Lingka, and the Lukhang. Dormitory blocks, offices and army barracks are built over the rest.

The Guāndì miào (關帝廟) or Gesar Lhakhang temple was erected by the Amban in 1792 atop Mount Bamare south of the Potala to celebrate the defeat of an invading Gurkha army. The main gate to the city of Lhasa used to run through the large Pargo Kaling chorten and contained holy relics of the Buddha Mindukpa.

In 2000 the urbanised area covered , with a population of around 170,000. Official statistics of the metropolitan area report that 70 percent are Tibetan, 24.3 are Han, and the remaining 2.7 Hui, though outside observers suspect that non-Tibetans account for some 50–70 percent. According to the Sixth Population Census in 2010, the population of Tibetans is 429,104, accounting for 76.70% of the total population of Lhasa. The second most populous ethnic group is the Han Chinese, with a population of 121,065, accounting for 21.64% of Lhasa&#x27;s total population. These two ethnic groups account for the vast majority of Lhasa&#x27;s total population, while other ethnic minorities account for only about 1.66% of Lhasa&#x27;s total population.

== Geography ==


Lhasa has an elevation of about and lies in the centre of the Tibetan Plateau with the surrounding mountains rising to . The air only contains 68 percent of the oxygen compared to sea level. The Lhasa River, also Kyi River or Kyi Chu, a tributary of the Yarlung Zangbo River (Brahmaputra River), runs through the southern part of the city. This river, known to local Tibetans as the &quot;merry blue waves&quot;, flows through the snow-covered peaks and gullies of the Nyainqêntanglha mountains, extending , and emptying into the Yarlung Zangbo River at Qüxü, forms an area of great scenic beauty. The marshlands, mostly uninhabited, are to the north. Ingress and egress roads run east and west, while to the north, the road infrastructure is less developed.

===Administration===

Chengguan District is located on the middle reaches of the Lhasa River, a tributary of the Brahmaputra River, with land that rises to the north and south of the river. It is from east to west and from north to south. Chengguan District is bordered by Doilungdêqên District to the west, Dagzê County to the east and Lhünzhub County to the north. Gonggar County of Lhoka (Shannan) Prefecture lies to the south.

Chengguan District has an elevation of and covers . The urban built-up area covers .The average annual temperature of . Annual precipitation is about to , mostly falling between July and September.
The term &quot;Chengguan District&quot; is the administrative term for the inner urban area or the urban centre within a prefecture, in this case the Prefectural-city of Lhasa. Outside of the urban area much of Chengguan District is mainly mountainous with a near nonexistent rural population.
Chengguan District is at the same administrative level as a county.
Chengguan District of Lhasa was established on 23 April 1961.
It currently has 12 fully urban subdistricts.

==Climate==
Owing to its very high elevation, Lhasa has a cool semi-arid climate (Köppen: &quot;BSk&quot;), bordering on both a monsoon-influenced subtropical highland climate (Köppen: &quot;Cwb&quot;) and a humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dwb&quot;), with frosty winters and mild summers, yet the valley location protects the city from intense cold or heat and strong winds. Monthly possible sunshine ranges from 53 percent in July to 84 percent in November, and the city receives nearly 3,000 hours of sunlight annually. It is thus sometimes called the &quot;sunlit city&quot; by Tibetans. The coldest month is January with an average temperature of and the warmest month is June and July with a daily average of , though nights have generally been warmer in July. The annual mean temperature is , with extreme temperatures ranging from on 17 January 1968 and 24 June 2019 respectively. Lhasa has an annual precipitation of with rain falling mainly in July, August and September. The driest month is December at and the wettest month is August, at . Summer is widely regarded the &quot;best&quot; of the year as rains come mostly at night and Lhasa is still sunny during the daytime.

== Demographics ==


=== Demographics in the past ===
The 11th edition of &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; published between 1910 and 1911 noted the total population of Lhasa, including the lamas in the city and vicinity was about 30,000, A census in 1854 made the figure 42,000, but it is known to have greatly decreased afterwards. &quot;Britannica&quot; noted that within Lhasa, there were about a total of 1,500 resident Tibetan laymen and about 5,500 Tibetan women. The permanent population also included Chinese families (about 2,000). The city&#x27;s residents included traders from Nepal and Ladakh (about 800), and a few from Bhutan, Mongolia and other places. The &quot;Britannica&quot; noted with interest that the Chinese had a crowded burial-ground at Lhasa, tended carefully after their manner and that the Nepalese supplied mechanics and metal-workers at that time.

In the first half of the 20th century, several Western explorers made celebrated journeys to the city, including William Montgomery McGovern, Francis Younghusband, Alexandra David-Néel, and Heinrich Harrer. Lhasa was the centre of Tibetan Buddhism as nearly half of its population were monks, Though this figure may include monks from surrounding monasteries who travelled to Lhasa for various celebrations and were not ordinarily resident there.

The majority of the pre-1950 Chinese population of Lhasa were merchants and officials. In the Lubu section of Lhasa, the inhabitants were descendants of Chinese vegetable farmers, some of whom married Tibetan wives. They came to Lhasa in the 1840s–1860s after a Chinese official was appointed to the position of Amban.

According to one writer, the population of the city was about 10,000, with some 10,000 monks at Drepung and Sera monasteries in 1959. Hugh Richardson, on the other hand, puts the population of Lhasa in 1952, at &quot;some 25,000–30,000—about 45,000–50,000 if the population of the great monasteries on its outskirts be included.&quot;

===Contemporary demographics===
The total population of Lhasa Prefecture-level City is 521,500 (including known migrant population but excluding military garrisons). Of this, 257,400 are in the urban area (including a migrant population of 100,700), while 264,100 are outside. Nearly half of Lhasa Prefecture-level City&#x27;s population lives in Chengguan District, which is the administrative division that contains the urban area of Lhasa (i.e. the actual city).

The urban area is populated by ethnic Tibetans, Han, Hui and other ethnic groups. The 2000 official census gave a total population of 223,001, of which 171,719 lived in the areas administered by city street offices and city neighborhood committees. 133,603 had urban registrations and 86,395 had rural registrations, based on their place of origin. The census was taken in November, when many of the ethnic Han workers in seasonal industries such as construction would have been away from Tibet, and did not count the military. A 2011 book estimated that up to two-thirds of the city&#x27;s residents are non-Tibetan, although the government states that Chengguan District as a whole is still 63% ethnic Tibetan. , half of Tibet&#x27;s Han population resided in the district, where bilingual or wholly Chinese teaching was common in the schools.

== Economy ==

Competitive industry together with feature economy play key roles in the development of Lhasa. With the view to maintaining a balance between population growth and the environment, tourism and service industries are emphasised as growth engines for the future.
Many of Lhasa&#x27;s rural residents practice traditional agriculture and animal husbandry. Lhasa is also the traditional hub of the Tibetan trading network. For many years, chemical and car making plants operated in the area and this resulted in significant pollution, a factor which has changed in recent years. Copper, lead and zinc are mined nearby and there is ongoing experimentation regarding new methods of mineral mining and geothermal heat extraction.

Agriculture and animal husbandry in Lhasa are considered to be of a high standard. People mainly plant highland barley and winter wheat. The resources of water conservancy, geothermal heating, solar energy and various mines are abundant. There is widespread electricity together with the use of both machinery and traditional methods in the production of such things as textiles, leathers, plastics, matches and embroidery. The production of national handicrafts has made great progress.
With the growth of tourism and service sectors, the sunset industries which cause serious pollution are expected to fade in the hope of building a healthy ecological system. Environmental problems such as soil erosion, acidification, and loss of vegetation are being addressed. The tourism industry now brings significant business to the region, building on the attractiveness of the Potala Palace, the Jokang, the Norbulingka Summer Palace and surrounding large monasteries as well the spectacular Himalayan landscape together with the many wild plants and animals native to the high altitudes of Central Asia. Tourism to Tibet dropped sharply following the crackdown on protests in 2008, but as early as 2009, the industry was recovering. Chinese authorities plan an ambitious growth of tourism in the region aiming at 10 million visitors by 2020; these visitors are expected to be domestic. With renovation around historic sites, such as the Potala Palace, UNESCO has expressed &quot;concerns about the deterioration of Lhasa&#x27;s traditional cityscape.&quot;
Lhasa contains several hotels. Lhasa Hotel is a 4-star hotel located northeast of Norbulingka in the western suburbs of the city. Completed in September 1985, it is the flagship of CITS&#x27;s installations in Tibet. It accommodates about 1000 guests and visitors to Lhasa. There are over 450 rooms (suites) in the hotel, and all are equipped with air conditioning, mini-bar and other basic facilities. Some of the rooms are decorated in traditional Tibetan style. The hotel was operated by Holiday Inn from 1986 to 1997 and is the subject of a book, &quot;The Hotel on the Roof of the World&quot;. Another hotel of note is the historical Banak Shöl Hotel, located at 8 Beijing Road in the city. It is known for its distinctive wooden verandas. The Nam-tso Restaurant is located in the vicinity of the hotel and is frequented especially by Chinese tourists visiting Lhasa.

Lhasa contains several businesses of note. Lhasa Carpet Factory, a factory south of Yanhe Dong Lu near the Tibet University, produces traditional Tibetan rugs that are exported worldwide. It is a modern factory, the largest manufacturer of rugs throughout Tibet, employing some 300 workers. Traditionally Tibetan women were the weavers, and men the spinners, but both work on the rugs today.

The Lhasa Brewery Company was established in 1988 on the northern outskirts of Lhasa, south of Sera Monastery and is the highest commercial brewery in the world at and accounts for 85 percent of contemporary beer production in Tibet. The brewery, consisting of five-story buildings, cost an estimated US$20–25 million, and by 1994, production had reached 30,000 bottles per day, employing some 200 workers by this time. Since 2000, the Carlsberg group has increased its stronghold in the Chinese market and has become increasingly influential in the country with investment and expertise. Carlsberg invested in the Lhasa Brewery in recent years and has drastically improved the brewing facility and working conditions, renovating and expanding the building to what now covers 62,240 square metres (15.3 acres).

== Architecture and cityscape ==


Lhasa has many sites of historic interest, including the Potala Palace, Jokhang Temple, Sera Monastery and Norbulingka. The Potala Palace, Jokhang Temple and the Norbulingka are UNESCO world heritage sites. However, many important sites were damaged or destroyed mostly, but not solely, during China&#x27;s Cultural Revolution of the 1960s. Many have been restored since the 1980s.

The Potala Palace, named after Mount Potala, the abode of Chenresig or Avalokitesvara, was the chief residence of the Dalai Lama. After the 14th Dalai Lama fled to India during the 1959 Tibetan uprising, the government converted the palace into a museum. The site was used as a meditation retreat by King Songtsen Gampo, who in 637 built the first palace there in order to greet his bride Princess Wen Cheng of the Tang dynasty of China. Lozang Gyatso, the Great Fifth Dalai Lama, started the construction of the Potala Palace in 1645 after one of his spiritual advisers, Konchog Chophel (d. 1646), pointed out that the site was ideal as a seat of government, situated as it is between Drepung and Sera monasteries and the old city of Lhasa. The palace underwent restoration works between 1989 and 1994, costing RMB55 million (US$6.875 million) and was inscribed to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1994.
The Lhasa Zhol Pillar, below the Potala, dates as far back as circa 764 CE. and is inscribed with what may be the oldest known example of Tibetan writing. The pillar contains dedications to a famous Tibetan general and gives an account of his services to the king including campaigns against China which culminated in the brief capture of the Chinese capital Chang&#x27;an (modern Xi&#x27;an) in 763 CE during which the Tibetans temporarily installed as Emperor a relative of Princess Jincheng Gongzhu (Kim-sheng Kong co), the Chinese wife of Trisong Detsen&#x27;s father, Me Agtsom.
Chokpori, meaning &#x27;Iron Mountain&#x27;, is a sacred hill, located south of the Potala. It is considered to be one of the four holy mountains of central Tibet and along with two other hills in Lhasa represent the &quot;Three Protectors of Tibet.&quot;, Chokpori (Vajrapani), Pongwari (Manjushri), and Marpori (Chenresig or Avalokiteshvara). It was the site of the most famous medical school Tibet, known as the Mentsikhang, which was founded in 1413. It was conceived of by Lobsang Gyatso, the &quot;Great&quot; 5th Dalai Lama, and completed by the Regent Sangye Gyatso (Sangs-rgyas rgya-mtsho) shortly before 1697.

Lingkhor is a sacred path, most commonly used to name the outer pilgrim road in Lhasa matching its inner twin, Barkhor. The Lingkhor in Lhasa was long enclosing Old Lhasa, the Potala and Chokpori hill. In former times it was crowded with men and women covering its length in prostrations, beggars and pilgrims approaching the city for the first time. The road passed through willow-shaded parks where the Tibetans used to picnic in summer and watch open air operas on festival days. New Lhasa has obliterated most of Lingkhor, but one stretch still remains west of Chokpori.

The Norbulingka palace and surrounding park is situated in the west side of Lhasa, a short distance to the southwest of Potala Palace and with an area of around , it is considered to be the largest man made garden in Tibet.
It was built from 1755. and served as the traditional summer residence of the successive Dalai Lamas until the 14th&#x27;s self-imposed exile. Norbulingka was declared a &#x27;National Important Cultural Relic Unit&quot;, in 1988 by the State council. In 2001, the Central Committee of the Chinese Government in its 4th Tibet Session resolved to restore the complex to its original glory. The Sho Dun Festival (popularly known as the &quot;yogurt festival&quot;) is an annual festival held at Norbulingka during the seventh Tibetan month in the first seven days of the Full Moon period, which corresponds to dates in July/August according to the Gregorian calendar.

The Barkhor is an area of narrow streets and a public square in the old part of the city located around Jokhang Temple and was the most popular devotional circumambulation for pilgrims and locals. The walk was about one kilometre () long and encircled the entire Jokhang, the former seat of the State Oracle in Lhasa called the Muru Nyingba Monastery, and a number of nobles&#x27; houses including Tromzikhang and Jamkhang. There were four large incense burners (&quot;sangkangs&quot;) in the four cardinal directions, with incense burning constantly, to please the gods protecting the Jokhang. Most of the old streets and buildings have been demolished in recent times and replaced with wider streets and new buildings. Some buildings in the Barkhor were damaged in the 2008 unrest.
The Jokhang is located on Barkhor Square in the old town section of Lhasa. For most Tibetans it is the most sacred and important temple in Tibet. It is in some regards pan-sectarian, but is presently controlled by the Gelug school. Along with the Potala Palace, it is probably the most popular tourist attraction in Lhasa. It is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site &quot;Historic Ensemble of the Potala Palace,&quot; and a spiritual centre of Lhasa. This temple has remained a key center of Buddhist pilgrimage for centuries. The circumambulation route is known as the &quot;kora&quot; in Tibetan and is marked by four large stone incense burners placed at the corners of the temple complex. The Jokhang temple is a four-story construction, with roofs covered with gilded bronze tiles. The architectural style is based on the Indian vihara design, and was later extended resulting in a blend of Nepalese and Tang dynasty styles. It possesses the statues of Chenresig, Padmasambhava and King Songtsan Gampo and his two foreign brides, Princess Wen Cheng (niece of Emperor Taizong of Tang) and Princess Bhrikuti of Nepal and other important items.

Ramoche Temple is considered the most important temple in Lhasa after the Jokhang Temple. Situated in the northwest of the city, it is east of the Potala and north of the Jokhang, covering a total area of 4,000 square meters (almost one acre). The temple was gutted and partially destroyed in the 1960s and its famous bronze statue disappeared. In 1983 the lower part of it was said to have been found in a Lhasa rubbish tip, and the upper half in Beijing. They have now been joined and the statue is housed in the Ramoche Temple, which was partially restored in 1986, and still showed severe damage in 1993. Following the major restoration of 1986, the main building in the temple now has three stories.
The Tibet Museum in Lhasa is the official museum of the Tibet Autonomous Region and was inaugurated on 5 October 1999. It is the first large, modern museum in the Tibet Autonomous Region and has a permanent collection of around 1000 artefacts, from examples of Tibetan art to architectural design throughout history such as Tibetan doors and construction beams. It is located in an L-shaped building west of the Potala Palace on the corner of Norbulingkha Road. The museum is organized into three main sections: a main exhibition hall, a folk cultural garden and administrative offices.

The Monument to the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet was unveiled in the Potala Square in May 2002 to celebrate the 51st anniversary of the Seventeen Point Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, and the work in the development of the autonomous region since then. The 37-metre-high concrete monument is shaped as an abstract Mount Everest and its name is engraved with the calligraphy of former CCP general secretary and PRC president Jiang Zemin, while an inscription describes the socioeconomic development experienced in Tibet in the past fifty years.

There are four mosques in and around Lhasa. The earliest mosque, called &quot;Khache Lingka&quot;, dates to 1650 and is located west of the city, and consists of two compounds. The Lhasa Great Mosque is the most prominent and built by the early 1700s. The Dokdé Mosque, north of Lhasa, has an adjacent cemetery and is dated to 1716. The fourth mosque, commonly known as &quot;Small Mosque&quot; (but also Barkor or Rapsel Alley Mosque), was built in the early 1900s.

==Culture==

There are some night spots that feature cabaret acts in which performers sing in Chinese, Tibetan, and English. Dancers wear traditional Tibetan costume with long flowing cloth extending from their arms. There are a number of small bars that feature live music, although they typically have limited drink menus and cater mostly to foreign tourists.

Duihuan (སྟོད་གཞས་) is a local form of music and dance in Tibet. While the traditional Dui Huan in Tibet has only one instrument, the Dui Huan in Lhasa has four instruments: in addition to the Zainianqin and the Yangqin, there are the Jinghu, the bamboo flute, and the stringed bells that are specially used for playing the rhythm. Together with the singing, they play, pull, strum and sing.

==Education==

There are 2 universities of Tibet University and Tibet Tibetan Medical University and 3 special colleges of Lhasa Teachers College, Tibet Police College and Tibet Vocational and Technical College in the Lhasa city.

Tibet University (Tibetan: བོད་ལྗོངས་སློབ་གྲྭ་ཆེན་མོ་) is the main university of Tibet Autonomous Region. Its campus is located in Chengguan District, Lhasa, east of the city-centre. A forerunner was created in 1952 and the university was officially established in 1985, funded by the Chinese government. About 8000 students are enrolled at the university. Tibet University is a comprehensive university with the highest academic level in Tibet Autonomous Region. It is a member of the prestigious Project 211, and is sponsored under the Double First-Class Construction initiative.

== Transport ==
===Rail===
Lhasa has been served by rail since 2006, when the Qinghai–Tibet Railway opened for passenger operations. Reaching an elevation of 5,072 metres above sea level, the Qinghai-Tibet railway is the world&#x27;s highest railway by elevation. It connects Lhasa with Xining, the capital of Qinghai Province, some away, and ultimately links Lhasa with other major cities with China&#x27;s extensive railway network. Five trains arrive at and depart from Lhasa railway station each day. Train number Z21 takes 40 hours and 53 minutes from Beijing West, arriving in Lhasa at 13:03 every day. Train Z22 from Lhasa to Beijing West departs at 15:30 and arrives in Beijing at 08:20 on the third day, taking 40 hours, 50 minutes. Trains also arrive in Lhasa from Chengdu, Chongqing, Lanzhou, Xining, Guangzhou, Shanghai and other cities. To counter the problem of altitude differences giving passengers altitude sickness, extra oxygen is pumped in through the ventilation system and available directly on each berth with close open control by a flap for the convenience of passengers, and personal oxygen masks are available on request. Within the soft sleeper cabins there are 64 seats per train, which have an electrical plug for electronics.

Lhasa is also connected to Xigazê, the second largest city in Tibet by rail service, since 2014. A third railway, the Sichuan-Tibet Railway, which links Lhasa with Nyingchi County and into the interior ultimately terminating in Chengdu, began construction in June 2015.

For onward rail travel in South Asia, the closest major station in India is New Jalpaiguri, Siliguri in West Bengal. However, extension of the Indian railway system to Sikkim will make it easier for onward connections through the South Asian railway network. There are preliminary plans to link Lhasa by rail with Kathmandu.

As per a Chinese Tibetan spokesperson, extension of this rail line to Kathmandu with tunnelling under Mount Everest was, as of 2015, expected to be completed by 2020.

===Air===

Lhasa Gonggar International Airport (IATA: LXA), built in 1965, is the aviation hub of Tibet. It is located south of the city proper. It takes around half an hour to get there by car via the Lhasa Airport Expressway; prior to the completion of the expressway in 2011, the trip to the airport took over an hour. , there are daily flights serving major Chinese cities including Beijing, Chengdu, Guangzhou, and Shanghai, and there are also occasional scheduled services to Kathmandu in Nepal. Lhasa Airport is the hub of Tibet Airlines, which offers regional services to other destinations in Tibet such as Nyingchi, Ngari Prefecture, Shigatse, and Qamdo.

===Road===

The Qinghai–Tibet Highway (part of G109) runs northeast toward Xining and eventually to Beijing and is the most-used road in Tibet. The Sichuan–Tibet Highway (part of G318) runs east towards Chengdu and eventually to Shanghai. G318 also runs west to Zhangmu on the Nepal border. The Xinjiang-Tibet Highway (G219) runs north from Lhasa to Yecheng, and then to Xinjiang. This road is rarely used due to the lack of amenities and petrol stations. A new , four-lane highway between Lhasa and the Gonggar Airport was built by the Transportation Department of Tibet at a cost of RMB 1.5 billion. This road is part of National Highway 318 and starts from the Lhasa railway station, passes through Caina Township in Qushui County, terminating between the north entrance of the Gala Mountain Tunnel and the south bridgehead of the Lhasa River Bridge, and en route goes over the first overpass of Lhasa at Liuwu Overpass.

===Maritime===
The closest seaports are Kolkata and Haldia in West Bengal, India. The Nathu La pass offers Chinese companies access to the port of Kolkata (Calcutta), situated about from Lhasa, for trans-shipments to and from Tibet.

== Sports ==
In 2014, the Lhasa Mass Culture and Sports Center (拉萨市群众文化体育中心) was completed in Liwu New District of Lhasa City. The center was built with the assistance of Beijing Municipality, which is the highest modern stadium in the world, the largest single building in Tibet and the largest modern building invested by the whole country in support of Tibet, and has won the Luban Prize, the highest honor in China&#x27;s construction industry, and has been called the &quot;Little Bird&#x27;s Nest&quot; by local people.

<doc id="238748" wikidata="Q19659194" url="?curid=238748" title="Romanowsky stain">
<text>Romanowsky staining is a prototypical staining technique that was the forerunner of several distinct but similar stains widely used in hematology (the study of blood) and cytopathology (the study of diseased cells). Romanowsky-type stains are used to differentiate cells for microscopic examination in pathological specimens, especially blood and bone marrow films, and to detect parasites such as malaria within the blood.

The staining technique is named after the Russian physician Dmitri Leonidovich Romanowsky (1861–1921), who was one of the first to recognize its potential for use as a blood stain.

Stains that are related to or derived from the Romanowsky-type stains include Giemsa, Jenner, Wright, Field, May–Grünwald, Pappenheim and Leishman stains. They differ in protocols and additives and their names are often confused with one another in practice.

==Mechanism==
The value of Romanowsky staining lies in its ability to produce a wide range of hues, allowing cellular components to be easily differentiated. This phenomenon is referred to as the &quot;Romanowsky effect&quot;, or more generally as metachromasia.

Eosin part of the stain is responsible for pink-orange hue of erythrocytes and granules inside cytoplasms of eosinophilic leukocytes.

===Romanowsky effect===
In 1891 Romanowsky developed a stain using a mixture of eosin (typically eosin Y) and aged solutions of methylene blue that formed hues unattributable to the staining components alone: distinctive shades of purple in the chromatin of the cell nucleus and within granules in the cytoplasm of some leukocytes. This became known as the Romanowsky effect. Eosin and pure methylene blue alone (or in combination) do not produce the Romanowsky effect, and the active stains which produce the effect are now considered to be azure B and eosin.

===Polychromed methylene blue===
Romanowsky-type stains can be made from either a combination of pure dyes, or from methylene blue that has been subject to oxidative demethylation, which results in the breakdown of methylene blue into multiple other stains, some of which are necessary to produce the Romanowsky effect. Methylene blue that has undergone this oxidative process is known as &quot;polychromed methylene blue&quot;. Polychromed methylene blue may contain up to 11 dyes, including methylene blue, azure A, azure B, azure C, thionine, methylene violet Bernthesen, methyl thionoline and thionoline. The exact composition of polychromed methylene blue depends on the method used, and even batches of the stain from the same manufacturer may vary in composition.

Common method of rapid oxidation uses increasing pH of the solution with potassium carbonate and boiling it, which introduces atmospheric oxygen. Other methods have been employed, as well, such as oxidation in acidic medium with dichromate anion.

Although azure B and eosin have been shown to be the required components to produce the Romanowsky effect, these stains in their pure forms have not always been used in the formulation of the staining solutions. The original sources of azure B (one of the oxidation products of methylene blue) were from polychromed methylene blue solutions, which were treated with oxidizing agents or allowed to naturally age in the case of Romanowsky. Ernst Malachowsky in 1891 was the first to purposely polychrome methylene blue for use in a Romanowsky-type stain.

==Types==

===Wright stain===
Wright&#x27;s stain can be used alone or in combination with the Giemsa stain, which is known as the Wright-Giemsa stain. Wright&#x27;s stain is named after James Homer Wright who in 1902 published a method using heat to produce polychromed methylene blue, which is combined with eosin Y. The polychromed methylene blue is combined with eosin and allowed to precipitate, forming an eosinate which is redissolved in methanol. The addition of Giemsa to Wright&#x27;s stain increases the brightness of the &quot;reddish-purple&quot; color of the cytoplasmic granules. The Wright&#x27;s and Wright-Giemsa stains are two of the Romanowsky-type stains in common use in the United States and are mainly used for the staining of blood and bone marrow films.

===Jenner stain===

Jenner&#x27;s stain is used in microscopy for staining blood smears. The stain is dark blue and results in very observable clearly stained nucleus.

===Giemsa stain===
Giemsa stain is composed of &quot;Azure II&quot; and eosin Y with methanol and glycerol as the solvent. &quot;Azure II&quot; is thought to be a mixture of azure B (which Giemsa called &quot;azure I&quot;) and methylene blue, although the exact composition of &quot;azure I&quot; is considered a trade secret. Comparable formulations using known dyes have been published and are commercially available. Giemsa stain is considered to be the standard stain for detection and identification of the malaria parasite.

===May-Grünwald stain===

The May-Grünwald-Giemsa is used for the staining of slides obtained by fine-needle aspiration in a histopathology lab for the diagnosis of tumorous cells.

=== Pappenheim stain ===

This method is a combination of May-Grünwald and Giemsa staining.

===Leishman stain===

In 1901 William Leishman developed a stain that was similar to Louis Jenner&#x27;s but with the replacement of pure methylene blue with polychromed methylene blue. Leishman&#x27;s stain is prepared from the eosinate of polychromed methylene blue and eosin Y using methanol as the solvent.

=== Field&#x27;s stain ===

Field stain is used for staining thick blood films in order to discover malarial parasites.

==Clinical importances==

===Blood and bone marrow pathology===

Romanowsky-type stains are widely used in the examination of blood, in the form of blood films, and in the microscopic examination of bone marrow biopsies and aspirate smears. Examination of both blood and bone marrow can be of importance in the diagnosis of a variety of blood diseases. In the United States the Wright and Wright-Giemsa variants of the Romanowsky-type stains are widely used, while in Europe Giemsa stain is commonly employed.

===Detection of malaria and other parasites===
Of the Romanowsky-type stains, the Giemsa stain is especially important in the detection and identification of malaria parasites in blood samples. Malaria antigen detection tests are an alternative to the staining and microscopic examination of blood films for the detection of malaria.

===Use in cytopathology===
Romanowsky-type stains are also used for the staining of cytopathologic specimens such as those produced from fine-needle aspirates and cerebrospinal fluid from lumbar punctures.

==History==

Although debate exists as to who deserves credit for this general staining method, popular usage has attributed it to Dmitri Leonidovich Romanowsky.

In the 1870s Paul Ehrlich used a mixture of acidic and basic dyes including acid fuchsin (acid dye) and methylene blue (basic dye) to examine blood films. In 1888 Cheslav Ivanovich Chenzinsky used methylene blue, but substituted the acid fuchsin used by Ehrlich with eosin. Chenzinsky&#x27;s stain combination was able to stain the malaria parasite (a member of the genus &quot;Plasmodium&quot;). Neither Ehrlich&#x27;s or Chenzinsky&#x27;s stains produced the Romanowsky effect as the methylene blue they used was not polychromed.

Dmitri Romanowsky in 1890 published preliminary findings of his blood stain (a combination of aged methylene blue and eosin), including the results when applied to malaria infected blood. This use of polychromed methylene blue differentiated Romanowsky&#x27;s stain (and the subsequent formulations) from those of Ehrlich and Chenzinsky, which lacked the purple hue associated with the Romanowsky effect. Romanowsky&#x27;s 1890 publication did not include a description of how he modified his methylene blue solution, but in his 1891 doctoral thesis he described methylene blue best as used after mold began forming on the surface. Other than the use of an aged methylene blue solution, Romanowsky&#x27;s stain was based on Chenzinsky&#x27;s stain technique. Romanowsky&#x27;s use of his method to study the malaria parasite has been attributed to the continued interest in his staining method.

Ernst Malachowsky has been credited with independently observing the same stain combination as Dmitri Romanowsky in 1891, although he has also been credited with being the first to do so. Malachowsky was the first to use a deliberately polychromed methylene blue solution, which Malachowsky accomplished by the addition of borax to the staining mixture. Malachowsky is reported to have demonstrated the stain on June 15, 1890, and in the same year to have published a paper &quot;describing his public demonstration&quot;. Both the Romanowsky and Malachowsky methods were able to stain the nucleus and cytoplasm of the malaria parasite, when until this point the stains used had only colored the cytoplasm.

In 1899, Louis Leopold Jenner developed a more stable version of the methylene blue and eosin stain by collecting the precipitate that forms in water-based mixtures and redissolving it in methanol. Romanowsky-type stains prepared from the collected precipitates are sometimes known as &quot;eosinates&quot;. Besides increasing the stability of the stain, the use of methanol in Jenner&#x27;s stain had the effect of fixing the blood samples, although Jenner&#x27;s version of the stain does not produce the Romanowsky effect.

Richard May and Ludwig Grünwald in 1892 published a version of the stain (now known as the May–Grünwald stain) which is similar to the version proposed by Jenner in 1899, and likewise does not produce the Romanowsky effect.

In 1901, both Karl Reuter and William Leishman developed stains that combined Louis Jenner&#x27;s use of alcohol as the solvent and Malachowsky&#x27;s use of polychromed methylene blue. Reuter&#x27;s stain differed from Jenner&#x27;s in using ethyl alcohol instead of methanol, and Leishman&#x27;s differed from Jenner&#x27;s by using eosin B instead of eosin Y.

James Homer Wright in 1902 published a method using heat to polychrome the methylene blue, which he combined with eosin Y. This technique is known as Wright&#x27;s stain.

Gustav Giemsa&#x27;s name has also become associated with the stain as he is credited with publishing a useful formulation and protocol in 1902. Giemsa attempted to use combinations of pure dyes rather than polychromed methylene blue solutions which are highly variable in composition. Giemsa sold the rights to produce his stain, but never fully published details on how he produced it, although it is thought that he used a combination of azure B and methylene blue. Giemsa published a number of modifications of his stains between 1902 and 1934. In 1904 he suggested adding glycerin to his stain, along with the methanol, to increase its stability.

Giemsa stain powders produced in Germany were widely used in the United States until the interruption of the supply during World War I, which caused increased utilization of James Homer Wright&#x27;s method for polychroming methylene blue.

<text>Lhasa () is a Japanese computer program used for unpacking or decompressing files in various compressed formats, including LHA (LZH) and ZIP. Lhasa is an open-source utility specifically designed for handling LHA compression, which was a common format for archiving files in early computer systems.

The development of Lhasa likely began in the early days of computing when the LHA compression format gained popularity. The LHA format, also known as LZH, was widely used in the 1980s and 1990s for archiving files on systems like the Amiga and early versions of Microsoft Windows.

<doc id="238751" wikidata="Q753479" url="?curid=238751" title="Bootstrap Protocol">
<text>The Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) is a computer networking protocol used in 
Internet Protocol networks to automatically assign an IP address to network devices from a configuration server. The BOOTP was originally defined in published in 1985.

While some parts of BOOTP have been effectively superseded by the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), which adds the feature of leases, parts of BOOTP are used to provide service to the DHCP protocol. Some DHCP servers also provide the legacy BOOTP functionality.

When a network-connected computer boots up, its IP stack broadcasts BOOTP network messages requesting an IP address assignment. A BOOTP configuration server replies to the request by assigning an IP address from a pool of addresses, which is preconfigured by an administrator.

BOOTP is implemented using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) for transport. Port number 67 is used by the server for receiving client requests, and port number 68 is used by the client for receiving server responses. BOOTP operates only on IPv4 networks.

Historically, BOOTP has also been used for Unix-like diskless workstations to obtain the network location of their boot image, in addition to the IP address assignment. Enterprises used it to roll out a pre-configured client (e.g., Windows) installation to newly installed PCs.

Initially requiring the use of a boot floppy disk to establish the initial network connection, manufacturers of network interfaces later embedded the protocol in the firmware of interface cards as well as system boards with on-board network interfaces, thus allowing direct network booting.

==History==
The BOOTP was first defined in September 1985 as a replacement for the Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP), published in June 1984. The primary motivation for replacing RARP with BOOTP is that RARP was a link layer protocol. This made implementation difficult on many server platforms, and required that a server be present on each individual IP subnet. BOOTP introduced the innovation of relay agents, which forwarded BOOTP packets from the local network using standard IP routing, so that one central BOOTP server could serve hosts on many subnets.

An increasing set of BOOTP vendor information extensions was defined to supply BOOTP clients of relevant information about the network, like default gateway, name server IP address, the domain name, etcetera.

With the advent of the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, the BOOTP vendor information extensions were incorporated as DHCP option fields, to allow DHCP servers to also serve BOOTP clients.

==Operation==
=== Case 1: Client and server on same network ===

When a BOOTP client is started, it has no IP address, so it broadcasts a message containing its MAC address onto the network. This message is called a “BOOTP request”, and it is picked up by the BOOTP server, which replies to the client with the following information that the client needs:
# The client&#x27;s IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway address.
# The IP address and host name of the BOOTP server.
# The IP address of the server that has the boot image, which the client needs to load its operating system.

When the client receives this information from the BOOTP server, it configures and initializes its TCP/IP protocol stack, and then connects to the server on which the boot image is shared. The client loads the boot image and uses this information to load and start its operating system.

The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) was developed as an extension of BOOTP. BOOTP is defined in Requests for Comments (RFC) 951 and 1084.

=== Case 2: Client and server on different networks ===

# Problem with the bootp request is that the request is broadcast. A broadcast IP datagram cannot pass through any router. The router discards this packet.
# To solve this problem, there is a need for an intermediary (relay).
# One of the host or router can be configured at application layer to operate as relay agent.
# The relay agent knows the uni-cast address of bootp server and listens for broadcast message on port 67.
# When it receives this broadcast packet, it encapsulates the message in unicast datagram and sends request to bootp server.
# The packet carrying a unicast destination address is routed by any router and reaches the bootp server.
# The relay agent, after receiving the reply, sends it to bootp client.

<text>Visakhapatnam (; formerly known as Vizagapatam, and also referred to as Vizag, Visakha, and Waltair) is the largest and most populous metropolitan city in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. It is between the Eastern Ghats and the coast of the Bay of Bengal. It is the second largest city on the east coast of India after Chennai, and the fourth largest in South India. It is one of the four smart cities of Andhra Pradesh selected under the Smart Cities Mission and is the headquarters of Visakhapatnam district. Vizag is popularly knows as &quot;shipbuilding capital of India&quot; due to presence of multiple shipyard such as Hindustan Shipyard, Naval Dockyard and being the central naval command of the east coast.

Visakhapatnam&#x27;s history dates back to the 6th century BCE. The city was ruled by the Andhra Satavahanas, Vengi, the Pallava and Eastern Ganga dynasties. Visakhapatnam was an ancient port city which had trade relations with the Middle East and Rome. Ships in Visakhapatnam were anchored at open roads and loaded with cargo transported from the shoreside using small masula boats. A reference to a Vizagapatnam merchant is available in the inscriptions of Bheemeswara temple (1068 CE) in the East Godavari District. During the 12th century CE, Vizagapatnam was a fortified mercantile town managed by a guild. European powers eventually established trade operations in the city, and by the end of the 18th century it had come under French colonial rule. Control of the city passed to the East India Company in 1804 and it remained under British colonial rule until Indian independence in 1947.

The city is home to some reputed Central and State educational institutions of the state, including Andhra University (AU), Andhra Medical College (AMC), Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Indian Institute of Petroleum and Energy (IIPE), Damodaram Sanjivayya National Law University (DSNLU), Indian Maritime University (IMU), and the National Institute of Oceanography among others.

== Etymology ==
The local belief behind the name of the city-states there was a king in the 4th century, who on his pilgrimage halted at Lawson&#x27;s Bay and built a temple dedicated to Vaisakha, which was submerged under the sea, but the name of the temple became attached to the settlement. Other historical names are, &quot;Kulotungapatnam&quot;, named by the Chola King Kulottunga I; &quot;Ishakapatnam&quot;, based on a Muslim Saint, Syed Ali Madani (Ishak Madani). During the East India Company rule in India, the city was known with the name, &quot;Vizagapatnam&quot;. The suburb &quot;Waltair&quot; is another such name which was derived from the name the British colonial government used. &quot;Vizagapatnam&quot; could also be spelled &quot;Visakhapatnam&quot; in the West European alphabet. The name was popularly shortened to &quot;Vizag&quot; and this form was in use right from the earliest days of British colonial rule in the district in the late eighteenth century. It is still referred to as Vizag by locals too, however since independence, people have reverted to calling it by its Indian name of Visakhapatnam.

== History ==
Visakhapatnam&#x27;s history stretches back to the 6th century BCE and the city finds mention in ancient texts such as the 4th century BCE writings of Pāṇini and Katyayana. Historically considered part of the Kalinga region, it was ruled by the Vengi kingdom and the Pallava and Eastern Ganga dynasties during medieval times. Archaeological records suggest that the present city was built around the 11th and 12th centuries C.E. by the Chola dynasty king Kulothunga I. Control over the city fluctuated between the Chola dynasty of Tamil Nadu and the Gajapati Kingdom of Odisha until its conquest by the Vijayanagara Empire in the 15th century. 

The city was ruled by the Andhra Kings of Vengi and Pallavas. The city is named after Sri Visakha Varma. Legend has it that Radha and Viśakha were born on the same day and were equally beautiful. Sri Visakka Sakhi is the second most important gopi of the eight main gopis. She carries messages between Radha and Krishna and is the most expert Gopi messenger. Residents believe that an Andhra king built a temple to pay homage to his family deity Viśakha. This is now inundated under seawater near R K Beach. Another theory is that it is named after a woman disciple of Buddha named Viśakha. Later it was ruled by Qutb Shahis (1571–1674), Kingdom of Jeypore (1535–1571) and (1674–1711), Mughal Empire (1711–1724) and Nizam (1724–1757). The French (1757) and British (1765) established Factories and influence over the city. In 1794 the Battle of Padmanabham occurred between the Zamindari of Vizianagaram and the East India Company. after the battle, Vizianagaram estate was acquired by the East India company in 1802.The British East India Company fought the 1804 Battle of Vizagapatnam and it remained the under British colonial rule until Indian independence in 1947 which was a part of the Northern Circars.

=== Buddhist influence ===

Hindu texts state that during the fifth century BCE, the Visakhapatnam region was part of Kalinga territory, which extended to the Godavari river. Relics found in the area also prove the existence of a Buddhist empire in the region. Kalinga later lost the territory to King Ashoka in the bloodiest battle of its time, which prompted Ashoka to embrace Buddhism. Ancient Buddhist sites, recently excavated, are scattered across Visakhapatnam, reflecting the region&#x27;s Buddhist legacy.

==== Pavurallakonda ====

Pavurallakonda (&quot;pigeon hill&quot;) is a hillock west of Bhimli, about from Visakhapatnam. The Buddhist settlement found here is estimated to date back from the first century BCE to the second century CE. On the hillock (which overlooks the coastline) are 16 rock-cut cisterns for collecting rainwater. Gopalapatnam, on the Tandava River, is a village surrounded by brick stupas, viharas, pottery and other Buddhist artefacts.

==== Sankaram ====

In 1907 British archaeologist Alexander Rea unearthed Sankaram, a 2,000-year-old Buddhist site. The name &quot;Śankaram&quot; derives from the Sangharama (temple or monastery). Located south of Visakhapatnam, it is known locally as Bojjannakonda and is a significant Buddhist site in Andhra Pradesh. The three major schools of Buddhism (Hinayana, Mahayana and Vajrayana) flourished here. The complex is known for its monolithic stupas, rock-cut caves and brick structures. The primary stupa was initially carved out of rock and covered with bricks. Excavations yielded historic pottery and Satavahana coins from the first century CE. At Lingalakonda, there are also rock-cut monolithic stupas in rows spread over the hill. The vihara, a monastery, was active for about 1,000 years.

Nearby is another Buddhist site, Bojjannakonda, with several images of the Buddha carved on the rock face of the caves. At Ligalametta there are hundreds of rock-cut monolithic stupas in rows, spread across the hill. Among other Buddhist attractions are a relic casket, three chaitya halls, votive platforms, stupas and Vajrayana sculptures.

==== Bavikonda ====
Bavikonda is an important Buddhist heritage site located on a hill about , northeast of Visakhapatnam city. Here the Buddhist habitation is noticed on a 16 ha flat terraced area. The Hinayana school of Buddhism was practised at the monastery between the 3rd century B.C. and the 3rd century A.D. Bavikonda has remains of an entire Buddhist complex, comprising 26 structures belonging to three phases. A piece of bone stored in an urn recovered here is believed to belong to the mortal remains of the Buddha. The word &quot;Bavikonda&quot; in Telugu means &quot;a hill of wells&quot;. Fitting its name, Bavikonda is a hill with wells for the collection of rainwater. It is located from Visakhapatnam and is a significant Buddhist site.

Excavation carried out from 1982 to 1987 revealed a Buddhist establishment including a mahachaitya, also referred to as a grand stupa, embedded with relic caskets, a large Vihara (monastery) complex, numerous votive stupas, a stone-pillared congregation and rectangular halls and a refectory. Artifacts recovered from the site include Roman and Satavahana coins and pottery dating from the third century BCE to the second century CE. A significant finding was a piece of bone (with a large quantity of ash) in an urn, which is believed to be the remains of the Buddha. The Bavikonda site is considered one of the oldest Buddhist sites in Asia. It is a reminder of the Buddhist civilisation which once existed in southern India, and also reminiscent of Borobudur in Indonesia.

==== Thotlakonda ====
About from Visakhapatnam is Thotlakonda, a Buddhist complex situated on top of a hill. The Buddhist complex on the Mangamaripeta hilltop, locally known as Totlakonda, lies about from Visakhapatnam on Visakhapatnam-Bheemili Beach Road. After its discovery (during an aerial survey), the Government of Andhra Pradesh declared the 48 ha site as a protected monument in 1978. Excavations from 1988 to 1992 exposed structural remains and artefacts, classified as Religious, Secular, and Civil. These structures include the Stupa, Chaityagrihas, pillared congregation halls, bhandagaras, refectory (bhojanasala), drainage, and stone pathways. The site covers an area of , and has been declared a protected area by the government of Andhra Pradesh. Excavations have revealed three kinds of structural remains: religious, secular, and civil. Structures include a mahastupa, sixteen votive stupas, a stone-pillared congregation hall, eleven rock-cut cisterns, well-paved stone pathways, an apsidal chaitya-griha, three round chaitgya-grihas, two votive platforms, ten viharas and a kitchen complex with three halls and a refectory (dining hall). Apart from the structures, Buddhist treasures excavated include nine Satavahana and five Roman silver coins, terracotta tiles, stucco decorative pieces, sculptured panels, miniature stupa models in stone, Buddha padas depicted with ashtamangala symbols (i.e. the eight auspicious symbols of Swastika, Shrivasta, Nandhyavarta, Vardhamanaka, Bhadrasana, Kalasha, Minyugala and Darpan) and early pottery.

=== Later history ===

The territory of Visakhapatnam then came under the Andhra rulers of Vengi, and Chalukyas and Pallavas ruled the land. The region was ruled by the Eastern Ganga king and the Gajapati kings from the 10th century to the 16th century CE. Based on archaeological evidence, the Prabhakar and the Eastern Ganga Kings built temples in the city in the 11th and 12th centuries. In the late 16th century, it came under the direct rule of the Suryavanshi king, Maharaja Vishwanath Dev Gajapati of Jeypore. However, from 1571 to 1674 it fell under the control and administration of the Qutb Shahi kings of Golconda who appointed a governor or Faujdar to collect taxes in the region. This Faujdar governed the area from Srikakulam or Chicacole as it was then known. In 1674, the Maharaja of Jeypore, Vishwambhar Dev defeated the Foujdar and claimed sovereignty from the deteriorating Qutb Shahis. Vishwambhar is also said to have defeated the Dutch East India Company who allegedly abducted locals, mostly fishermen living by the sea-shore. Later his descendant, Maharaja Raghunath Krishna Dev defeated the Seer Lascer appointed by the Mughals and maintained his rule over the region. Therefore, Visakhapatnam remained a part of the Kingdom of Jeypore until the death of Maharaja Ram Chandra Dev I in 1711 after which it was taken over by the Nizam of Hyderabad who could only govern it for a few decades before transferring it to the British. Even in the colonial era, the kings of Jeypore were referred to as the Maharaja or Raja of Vizagapatnam. European merchants from France, Holland and the East India Company used the natural port to export tobacco, paddy, coal, iron ore, ivory, muslin and other textile products. The British developed Visakhapatnam as a prominent harbour on the east coast. The old port in Jalari Peta was built and used by the Maharaja of Jeypore who also owned several ships. During the First World War, Maharaja Vikram Dev III sent his fleet of ships to aid the British and later donated the port to the British government of Madras. It is now a fish market.

Local legend tells that an Andhra king, on his way to Benares, rested at Visakhapatnam and was so enchanted by its beauty that he ordered a temple to be built in honour of his family deity, Viśakha. Archaeological sources, however, reveal that the temple was probably built between the 11th and 12th centuries by the Cholas. A shipping merchant, Sankarayya Chetty, built one of the mandapams (pillared halls) of the temple. Although it no longer exists (possibly washed away about 100 years ago by a cyclonic storm), elderly residents of Visakhapatnam remember visits to the ancient shrine by their grandparents (although author Ganapatiraju Atchuta Rama Raju denies this).

During the 18th century Visakhapatnam was part of the Northern Circars, a region comprising coastal Andhra and southern coastal Odisha which was first under French control and later British. Visakhapatnam became a district in the Madras Presidency of British India. In September 1804, British and French squadrons fought the Battle of Vizagapatam near the harbour. After India&#x27;s independence, it was the largest district in the country and was subsequently divided into the districts of Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and Visakhapatnam.

Part of the city is known by its colonial British name, Waltair; during the colonial era, the city&#x27;s hub was the Waltair railway station and a part of the city is still called Waltair.

<text>Nannayya Bhattaraka or Nannayya Bhattu (sometimes spelled Nannaya; ) was a Telugu poet and the author of &quot;Andhra Mahabharatam&quot;, a Telugu retelling of the Sanskrit-language &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. Nannaya is generally considered the first poet (&quot;Adi Kavi&quot;) of Telugu language. He was patronized by Rajaraja Narendra of Rajamahendravaram. Rajaraja Narendra was an admirer of &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and wanted the message of the Sanskrit epic to reach the Telugu masses in their own language and idiom. He commissioned Nannaya, a scholar well versed in Vedas, Puranas, and Itihasas for the task. Nannaya began his work in and wrote Adi Parvam, Sabaparvam, and a part of Aranyaparvam.

Nannaya is the first of the three Telugu poets, called the &quot;Kavitrayam&quot; (&quot;trinity of poets&quot;), who wrote &quot;Andhra Mahabharatam&quot;. His work, which is rendered in the Champu style, is chaste and polished and of a high literary merit. The advanced and well-developed language used by Nannaya suggests that prior Telugu literature other than royal grants and decrees must have existed before him. However, these presumed works are now lost. Legends also credit him with writing the Sanskrit-language &quot;Andhra-shabda-chintamani&quot;, said to be the first work on Telugu grammar.

==Early life==
Nannaya was born in a Telugu Brahmin family. He resided in Rajamahendravaram under the patronage of Eastern Chalukya king Rajaraja Narendra.

== Andhra Mahabharatam ==
Rajaraja Narendra was an admirer of &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and wanted the message of the Sanskrit epic to reach the Telugu masses in their own language and idiom. He commissioned Nannaya, a scholar well versed in Vedas, Puranas, and Itihasas for the task. Nannaya wrote Adi Parvam, Sabaparva, and a part of Aranyaparvam. Later in the 13th century Tikkana left the remainder of Aranyaparvam and wrote 15 parvams from Virata Parvam to Svargarohana Parvam. After that in the 14th century Errana Aranyaparva filled the remainder.

== Grammar ==

Some legends credit Nannaya with writing &quot;Andhra-shabda-chintamani&quot; (&quot;Magic Jewel of Telugu Words&quot;), a Sanskrit-language work that was the first treatise on Telugu grammar. This lost work is said to have contained five chapters with 82 verses in the Arya metre. Nannaya is said to have written this text with help of his friend Narayana Bhatta. Nannaya&#x27;s grammar is said to have been divided into five chapters, covering samjnā, sandhi, ajanta, halanta and kriya.

Yelakuchi Bala-sarasvati wrote a Telugu gloss (commentary) on this work, and his &quot;Bala-sarasvatiyamu&quot; refers to this legend in brief. A more elaborate version of the legend appears in Appa-kavi&#x27;s &quot;Appakavīyamu&quot; (1656). According to this version, Bhimana, who was jealous of Nannaya, stole and destroyed &quot;Andhra-shabda-chintamani&quot; by throwing it in the Godavari River. Unknown to others, King Rajaraja-narendra&#x27;s son Saranga-dhara, an immortal &quot;siddha&quot;, had memorized Nannaya&#x27;s grammar. He gave a written copy of Nannaya&#x27;s work to Bala-sarasvati near Matanga Hill (at Vijayanagara), and Bala-sarasvati wrote a Telugu gloss (commentary) on the work. With help of the god Vishnu, Appa-kavi received a copy of Nannaya&#x27;s work, and wrote &quot;Appakavīyamu&quot; as a commentary on this text. &quot;Ahobala-panditiya&quot; (also known as &quot;Kavi-siro-bhushana&quot;), a Sanskrit commentary on &quot;Andhra-shabda-chintamani&quot;, also retells this story.

While some of the grammatical &quot;sutras&quot; in Appa-kavi&#x27;s work may be from Nannaya&#x27;s time, &quot;Andhra-shabda-chintamani&quot; is an imaginary work, and was probably fabricated by Bala-sarasvati himself. Although Appa-kavi describes his work as a commentary, it is really an original work.

<text>Tikkana (or Tikkana Somayaji) (1205–1288) was a 13th century Telugu poet. Born into a Telugu-speaking Niyogi Brahmin family during the golden age of the Kakatiya dynasty, he was the second poet of the &quot;Trinity of Poets (Kavi Trayam)&quot; that translated &quot;Mahabharata&quot; into Telugu. Nannaya Bhattaraka, the first, translated two and a half chapters of &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. Tikkana translated the final 15 chapters, but did not undertake translating the half-finished &quot;Aranya Parvamu&quot;. The Telugu people remained without this last translation for more than a century, until it was translated by Errana.

Tikkana is also called Tikkana Somayaji, as he completed the Somayaga. Tikkana&#x27;s titles were &quot;Kavibrahma&quot; and &quot;Ubhaya Kavi Mitrudu&quot;.

==Religious conflict==
Tikkana was born in 1205 in Patur village, Kovur, Nellore district during the Golden Age of the Kakatiya dynasty. During this time conflict occurred between the two sects of Sanātana Dharma, Shaivism and Vaishnavism. Tikkana attempted to bring peace to the warring Shivaites and Vaishnavites.

==Political situation==

Tikkana was a minister of the Nellore Choda ruler Manuma-siddhi II. In 1248, Manuma-siddhi II faced multiple rebellions, and lost control of his capital. He faced Tikkana as an emissary to the court of his overlord, the Kakatiya king Ganapati-deva. Ganapati received Tikkana warmly, and sent an army that re-established Manuma-siddhi II on the throne of Nellore.

==Writing style==
His writing style was mostly Telugu, unlike Nannayya whose work was mostly sanskritized. Tikkana used Telugu words even to express very difficult ideas. He used Telugu words and parables extensively.

In the colophons of his work, Tikkana calls himself &quot;a friend to both [kinds of] poets&quot; (&quot;Ubhaya-kavi-mitra&quot;). The meaning of this phrase is not clear: it may refer to Sanskrit and Telugu poets; or Shaivite and non-Shaivite poets; or Brahmin and non-Brahmin poets; or folk poets and scholarly poets.

==Legacy and depictions in popular culture==
The 15th or 16th century poet Nutana-kavi Suranna claimed descent from Tikkana.

There is a library named after him in Guntur. It is maintained by a committee headed by Machiraju Sitapati and Kurakula Guraviah, an ex-corporator. In 2013 they celebrated 100 years of the library&#x27;s functioning.
There was a television series made on the life of Tikkana.

<text>Yarrapragada or Erranna was a Telugu poet in the court of King Prolaya Vema Reddy (1325–1353). The surname of Erranna was Yerrapragada or Yerrana, which are epithets of the fair-skinned Lord Skanda in the Telugu language, but became attached to his paternal family due its having notable members with fair or red-skinned complexions. He was bestowed with the title of &quot;Prabandha-paramēśvara&quot; (&quot;Master of historical anecdotes&quot;) and &quot;Śambhudāsuḍu&quot; (&quot;Servant of Lord Śiva&quot;).
==Birth and family==
Errapragada Erranna was born in the village of Gudlur, located in Pakanadu (presently Nellore district), and later lived in Chadalawada. He was a member of the Niyogī Brahma-bandhu sub-caste. His family were shaivists, but he himself worshipped both Shiva and Vishnu.

<doc id="238765" wikidata="Q26168" url="?curid=238765" title="Anton LaVey">
<text>Anton Szandor LaVey (born Howard Stanton Levey; April 11, 1930 – October 29, 1997) was an American author, musician, and LaVeyan Satanist. He was the founder of the Church of Satan, the philosophy of LaVeyan Satanism, and the concept of Satanism. He authored several books, including &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot;, &quot;The Satanic Rituals&quot;, &quot;The Satanic Witch&quot;, &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Notebook&quot;, and &quot;Satan Speaks!&quot; In addition, he released three albums, including &quot;The Satanic Mass&quot;, &quot;Satan Takes a Holiday&quot;, and &quot;Strange Music&quot;. He played a minor on-screen role and served as technical advisor for the 1975 film &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Rain&quot; and served as host and narrator for Nick Bougas&#x27; 1989 mondo film &quot;Death Scenes&quot;.

Historian of Satanism Gareth J. Medway described LaVey as a &quot;born showman&quot;, with anthropologist Jean La Fontaine describing him as a &quot;colourful figure of considerable personal magnetism&quot;. The academic scholars of Satanism Per Faxneld and Jesper Aagaard Petersen described LaVey as &quot;the most iconic figure in the Satanic milieu&quot;. LaVey was labeled many things by journalists, religious detractors, and Satanists alike, including &quot;The Father of Satanism&quot;, the &quot;St. Paul of Satanism&quot;, &quot;The Black Pope&quot;, and the &quot;evilest man in the world&quot;.

==Early life==
LaVey was born Howard Stanton Levey on April 11, 1930 in Chicago, Illinois. His father, Michael Joseph Levey (1903–1992) married LaVey&#x27;s mother, Gertrude Augusta ( Coultron). His parents supported his musical interests, as he tried a number of instruments; his favorites were keyboards such as the piano and accordion. Anton played piano in a Baptist church as a boy, and played oboe in high school. He attended Tamalpais High School in Mill Valley, California, until the age of 16. LaVey claimed he left high school at age 16 to join the Clyde Beatty Circus and later carnivals, first as a roustabout and cage boy in an act with the big cats, then as a musician playing the calliope. He played tunes such as &quot;Harlem Nocturne&quot; by Earle Hagen. LaVey later claimed to have seen that many of the same men attended both the bawdy Saturday night shows and the tent revival meetings on Sunday mornings, which reinforced his increasingly cynical view of religion. In the foreword to the German language edition of &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot;, he cites this as the impetus to defy Christian religion as he knew it. He explains why churchgoers employ moral double standards. However, journalist Lawrence Wright investigated LaVey&#x27;s background and found no evidence LaVey ever worked in a circus either as a musician or a cage boy.

In the winter of 1948, LaVey began to work as an organist in bars, lounges, and nightclubs. His &quot;genius&quot; on keyboards helped him attain gigs. He claimed to have had a brief affair with then-unknown Marilyn Monroe while playing organ in Los Angeles burlesque houses, stating that she was a dancer at the Mayan Theater at the time. This was challenged by those who knew Monroe then, as well as the manager of the Mayan, Paul Valentine, who said she had never been one of his dancers, nor had the theater ever been used as a burlesque house.

According to his biography, LaVey moved back to San Francisco. LaVey met Carole Lansing in 1950, and they married the following year, when Lansing was fifteen years old. Lansing gave birth to LaVey&#x27;s first daughter, Karla LaVey, born in 1952. In order to avoid the Korean War draft, he studied criminology at City College of San Francisco. LaVey then attained a job as a photographer for the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD), where he worked for three years. (Wright could find no evidence of LaVey working at this job either.) LaVey claimed to have dabbled as a psychic investigator, looking into &quot;800 calls&quot; referred to him by SFPD. Later biographers questioned whether LaVey ever worked with the SFPD, as there are no records substantiating the claim.

During this period, LaVey was friends with a number of writers associated with &quot;Weird Tales&quot; magazine; a picture of him with George Haas, Robert Barbour Johnson, and Clark Ashton Smith appears in Blanche Barton&#x27;s biography &quot;The Secret Life of a Satanist&quot;.

LaVey and Carole divorced in 1960, after LaVey became involved with Diane Hegarty. Hegarty and LaVey never married, but she was his companion for 24 years and mothered his second daughter, Zeena Galatea Schreck (&quot;née&quot; LaVey) (born in 1963). At the end of their relationship, Hegarty sued for palimony.

==Church of Satan==
Anton Lavey became a local celebrity in San Francisco through his paranormal research and live performances as an organist, including playing the Wurlitzer at the Lost Weekend cocktail lounge. He was also a publicly noticeable figure; he drove a coroner&#x27;s van around town, and he walked his pet black leopard, named Zoltan. He attracted many San Francisco notables to his parties. Guests included Carin de Plessin, Michael Harner, Chester A. Arthur III, Forrest J Ackerman, Fritz Leiber, Cecil E. Nixon, and Kenneth Anger. LaVey formed a group called the Order of the Trapezoid, which later evolved into the governing body of the Church of Satan. According to Faxneld and Petersen, the Church of Satan represented &quot;the first public, highly visible, and long-lasting organisation which propounded a coherent Satanic discourse&quot;.

LaVey began presenting Friday night lectures on the occult and rituals. A member of this circle suggested that he had the basis for a new religion. According to LaVey himself, on Walpurgisnacht, April 30, 1966, he ritualistically shaved his head, allegedly &quot;in the tradition of ancient executioners&quot;, declared the founding of the Church of Satan and proclaimed 1966 as &quot;the Year One&quot;, Anno Satanas, the first year of the Age of Satan. LaVey&#x27;s image has been described as &quot;&quot;, and may have been inspired by an occult-themed episode of the television show The Wild Wild West titled &quot;The Night of the Druid&#x27;s Blood&quot; which originally aired on March 25, 1966 and starred Don Rickles as the evil magician and Satanic cult leader Asmodeus, whose Mephistophelean persona is virtually identical to that which LaVey adopted one month later. Media attention followed the subsequent Satanic wedding ceremony of journalist John Raymond to New York City socialite Judith Case on February 1, 1967. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; were among the newspapers that printed articles dubbing him &quot;The Black Pope&quot;. LaVey performed Satanic baptisms (including the first Satanic baptism in history for his three-year-old daughter Zeena, dedicating her to Satan and the Left-Hand Path, which garnered worldwide publicity and was originally recorded on &quot;The Satanic Mass&quot; LP).

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, LaVey melded ideological influences from Friedrich Nietzsche, Ayn Rand, H. L. Mencken, and social Darwinism with the ideology and ritual practices of the Church of Satan. He wrote essays introduced with reworked excerpts from Ragnar Redbeard&#x27;s &quot;Might Is Right&quot; and concluded with &quot;Satanized&quot; versions of John Dee&#x27;s &quot;Enochian Keys&quot; to create books such as &quot;The Complete Witch&quot; (re-released in 1989 as &quot;The Satanic Witch&quot;), and &quot;The Satanic Rituals&quot;. The latter book also included rituals drawing on the work of H. P. Lovecraft. Admitting his use of &quot;Might is Right&quot;, LaVey stated that he did so in order to &quot;immortalize a writer who had profoundly reached me&quot;.

In 1972, the public work at LaVey&#x27;s Black House in San Francisco was curtailed and work was continued via sanctioned regional &quot;grottoes&quot;. In early 1975, LaVey announced that higher degrees of initiation could be given in return for a financial contribution. In June 1975, editor of the Church&#x27;s newsletter, Michael Aquino, left the Church of Satan and formed the theistic Temple of Set, claiming to take an unknown number of dissenters with him. The Church maintains this policy announcement was designed to &quot;clean house&quot; of members who did not understand Satanic philosophy.

==Later life and death==
In 1980, the FBI interviewed LaVey in connection with an alleged plot to murder Ted Kennedy. LaVey told the agents that most of the church&#x27;s followers were &quot;fanatics, cultists, and weirdos&quot;. The agents reported that LaVey&#x27;s &quot;interest in the Church of Satan is strictly from a monetary point of view,&quot; and that he spent &quot;most of his time furnishing interviews, writing material, and lately has become interested in photography.&quot;

In July 1984, Hegarty issued a restraining order against LaVey, which he did not contest. LaVey&#x27;s third and final companion was Blanche Barton. On November 1, 1993, Barton gave birth to Satan Xerxes Carnacki LaVey. Barton succeeded LaVey as the head of the Church after his death and has since stepped down from that role and handed it to Magus Peter H. Gilmore.

According to his family, Anton LaVey died on October 29, 1997, in St. Mary&#x27;s Medical Center in San Francisco of pulmonary edema; however, his death certificate lists October 31, 1997. He was taken to St. Mary&#x27;s, a Catholic hospital, because it was the closest available. A secret Satanic funeral, attended by invitation only, was held in Colma, after which LaVey&#x27;s body was cremated.

On February 2, 1998, his estranged daughter Zeena Schreck and her then husband Nikolas Schreck published a nine-page &quot;fact sheet&quot;, in which they endorsed Wright&#x27;s earlier allegations and claimed that many more of LaVey&#x27;s stories about his life had been false.

==Thought==
LaVey included references to other esoteric and religious groups throughout his writings, claiming for instance that the Yazidis and Knights Templar were carriers of a Satanic tradition that had been passed down to the twentieth century. Scholar of Satanism Per Faxneld believed that these references were deliberately tongue-in-cheek and ironic, but he noted that many Satanists who had read LaVey&#x27;s writings had taken them to be literal historical claims about the past. Although he regularly derided older esotericists, LaVey also relied upon their work; for instance, making use of John Dee&#x27;s Enochian system in &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot;. Faxneld therefore believed that there was a tension in LaVey&#x27;s thought between his desire to establish prestigious Satanic predecessors and his desire to be seen as the founder of the first real Satanic society.

Dyrendel argued that LaVey partook in conspiracy culture as he grew older, for he was greatly concerned with modern society&#x27;s impact on individual agency. LaVey was conservative in his attitude to law and order and insisted that the Church abide by state law in all of its actions. He supported eugenics and believed that it would be a necessity in the future. LaVey hated rock and metal music, with or without &quot;Satanic&quot; lyrics, and often expressed his distaste for it.

==Reception and legacy==
Historian of Satanism Gareth J. Medway described LaVey as &quot;A born showman&quot;, with anthropologist Jean La Fontaine describing him as &quot;A colourful figure of considerable personal magnetism&quot;. Medway contrasted LaVey from the likes of Jim Jones, David Koresh, and Charles Manson, noting that whereas the latter were the charismatic leaders of apocalyptic communes, within the Church of Satan, &quot;No one hung onto [LaVey&#x27;s] every word, and church members [were] allowed considerable autonomy.&quot;

The academic scholars, Per Faxneld and Jesper Aagaard Petersen, described LaVey as &quot;the most iconic figure in the Satanic milieu&quot;, while Asbjørn Dyrendel described him as &quot;the founder of modern Satanism&quot;. In his 2001 examination of Satanists, the sociologist James R. Lewis noted that, to his surprise, his findings &quot;consistently pointed to the centrality of LaVey&#x27;s influence on modern Satanism&quot;. As a result he &quot;concluded thatdespite his heavy dependence on prior thinkersLaVey was directly responsible for the genesis of Satanism as a serious religious (as opposed to a purely literary) movement&quot;.

His books &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; and &quot;The Satanic Rituals&quot; have been cited as having &quot;an influence far beyond&quot; the Church of Satan&#x27;s membership. In 1995, the religious studies scholar Graham Harvey wrote that although the Church had no organized presence in Britain, LaVey&#x27;s writings were widely accessible in British bookshops.

Due to increasing visibility through his books, LaVey was the subject of numerous articles in the news media throughout the world, including popular magazines such as &quot;Look&quot;, &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot;, and &quot;Time&quot;, and men&#x27;s magazines. He also appeared on talk shows such as &quot;The Joe Pyne Show&quot;, &quot;Donahue&quot;, and &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, and in a feature-length documentary called &quot;Satanis&quot; in 1970. LaVey claimed that he had been appointed consultant to the film &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot;, which revolved around a group of fictional Satanists, and that he also had a cameo appearance in the film as the Devil. However, critics have argued that none of this was true. In an article published in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine in 1991, the journalist Lawrence Wright revealed that through his own investigative work, he found that many of LaVey&#x27;s claims about his life had been untrue. Two official biographies have been written on LaVey, including &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Avenger&quot; by Burton H. Wolfe, published in 1974 and &quot;The Secret Life of a Satanist&quot; by Blanche Barton, published in 1990.

==Politics==
Due to James H. Madole&#x27;s opposition to Christianity, he sought new religious ideas and was attracted to a merging of fascism and Satanism that led to an alliance between LaVey and Madole. &quot;Black Sun&quot; by Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke states, &quot;James Wagner, a former Security Echelon (SE) commander, recalls that relations between the NRP and the Church of Satan, founded in 1966 by Anton Szandor LaVey, were cordial. Madole and LaVey frequently met at the NRP office and in the Warlock Bookshop in New York.&quot;

==In popular culture==
* In Season 8 of &quot;American Horror Story&quot; (&quot;American Horror Story: Apocalypse&quot;), episode &quot;Return To Murder House&quot; (2018), LaVey is portrayed by Carlo Rota. This portrayal of LaVey received criticism from the Church of Satan, accusing the show of a biased representation of LaVey, who was depicted as worshipping a literal Satan.
* In the feature film &quot;Polanski Unauthorized&quot;, Lavey is shown as an advisor in Roman Polanski&#x27;s movie &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot;, portrayed by Tom Druilhet.
* &quot;Realm of Satan&quot;, 2024 documentary about the Church of Satan.

<doc id="238766" wikidata="Q13402954" url="?curid=238766" title="C file input/output">
<text>The C programming language provides many standard library functions for file input and output. These functions make up the bulk of the C standard library header . The functionality descends from a &quot;portable I/O package&quot; written by Mike Lesk at Bell Labs in the early 1970s, and officially became part of the Unix operating system in Version 7.

The I/O functionality of C is fairly low-level by modern standards; C abstracts all file operations into operations on streams of bytes, which may be &quot;input streams&quot; or &quot;output streams&quot;. Unlike some earlier programming languages, C has no direct support for random-access data files; to read from a record in the middle of a file, the programmer must create a stream, seek to the middle of the file, and then read bytes in sequence from the stream.

The stream model of file I/O was popularized by Unix, which was developed concurrently with the C programming language itself. The vast majority of modern operating systems have inherited streams from Unix, and many languages in the C programming language family have inherited C&#x27;s file I/O interface with few if any changes (for example, PHP).

==Overview==
This library uses what are called streams to operate with physical devices such as keyboards, printers, terminals or with any other type of files supported by the system. Streams are an abstraction to interact with these in a uniform way. All streams have similar properties independent of the individual characteristics of the physical media they are associated with.

Most of the C file input/output functions are defined in (or in the C++ header , which contains the standard C functionality but in the namespace).

===Constants===
Constants defined in the header include:

===Variables===

Variables defined in the header include:

===Member types===
Data types defined in the header include:
* – also known as a file handle or a , this is an opaque pointer containing the information about a file or text stream needed to perform input or output operations on it, including:
**platform-specific identifier of the associated I/O device, such as a file descriptor 
**the buffer
**stream orientation indicator (unset, narrow, or wide)
**stream buffering state indicator (unbuffered, line buffered, fully buffered)
**I/O mode indicator (input stream, output stream, or update stream)
**binary/text mode indicator
**end-of-file indicator
**error indicator
**the current stream position and multibyte conversion state (an object of type mbstate_t)
**reentrant lock (required as of C11)
* – a non-array type capable of uniquely identifying the position of every byte in a file and every conversion state that can occur in all supported multibyte character encodings
* – an unsigned integer type which is the type of the result of the operator.

===Extensions===
The POSIX standard defines several extensions to in its Base Definitions, among which are a function that allocates memory, the and functions that establish the link between objects and file descriptors, and a group of functions for creating objects that refer to in-memory buffers.

==Example==
The following C program opens a binary file called &quot;myfile&quot;, reads five bytes from it, and then closes the file.
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int main(void) {
 char buffer[5];
 FILE* fp = fopen(&quot;myfile&quot;, &quot;rb&quot;);

 if (fp == NULL) {
 perror(&quot;Failed to open file \&quot;myfile\&quot;&quot;);
 return EXIT_FAILURE;

 if (fread(buffer, 1, 5, fp) &lt; 5) {
 fclose(fp);
 fputs(&quot;An error occurred while reading the file.\n&quot;, stderr);
 return EXIT_FAILURE;

 fclose(fp);

 printf(&quot;The bytes read were: &quot;);
 for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; ++i) {
 printf(&quot;%02X &quot;, buffer[i]);
 putchar(&#x27;\n&#x27;);

 return EXIT_SUCCESS;


==Alternatives to stdio==
Several alternatives to have been developed. Among these is the C++ library, part of the ISO C++ standard. ISO C++ still requires the functionality.

Other alternatives include the Sfio (A Safe/Fast I/O Library) library from AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories. This library, introduced in 1991, aimed to avoid inconsistencies, unsafe practices and inefficiencies in the design of . Among its features is the possibility to insert callback functions into a stream to customize the handling of data read from or written to the stream. It was released to the outside world in 1997, and the last release was 1 February 2005.

<text>Michael Praed ( ; born 1 April 1960), birth name Michael David Prince, is a British actor and narrator, best remembered for his role as Robin of Loxley in the British television series &quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot;, which attained cult status worldwide.

==Career==
Praed was born in Berkeley, Gloucestershire, and educated at Eastbourne College, after which he became an actor.

He discovered that the British actors&#x27; union Equity already had a &quot;Michael Prince&quot; among its members, so he chose a surname out of a telephone book to use as a stage name. The name Praed is a Cornish word meaning &quot;meadow&quot;.

Praed is remembered for his roles as Prince Michael of Moldavia on the American primetime soap &quot;Dynasty&quot;, Robin Hood in the &quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot; (1984 TV series), and as Phileas Fogg in &quot;The Secret Adventures of Jules Verne&quot; (2000). He is also known in the British Isles for his stage work in musicals and drama and lately for his narrations. He has been the regular narrator for BBC TV&#x27;s history programme &quot;Timewatch&quot; since 2003. In July 2009, he starred as Captain von Trapp in a national tour of a revival of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;.

In 2016, Praed began to appear in the ITV soap opera &quot;Emmerdale&quot;, as Frank Clayton, the father of the characters Vanessa Woodfield and Tracy Metcalfe. His character was killed off following an explosion in the sweet factory. His last appearance aired on ITV on 1 August 2019.

==Personal life==
Praed was previously married to Karen Landau (1994–2009), with whom he has two children. He is now married to Josefina Gabrielle.

<text>A carriage return, sometimes known as a cartridge return and often shortened to CR, codice_1 or return, is a control character or mechanism used to reset a device&#x27;s position to the beginning of a line of text. It is closely associated with the line feed and newline concepts, although it can be considered separately in its own right.

==Typewriters==
Originally, the term &quot;carriage return&quot; referred to a mechanism or lever on a typewriter. For machines where the type element was fixed and the paper held in a moving &quot;carriage&quot;, this lever was on the left attached to the moving carriage, and operated after typing a line of text to cause the carriage to return to the far right so the type element would be aligned to the left side of the paper. The lever would also usually &quot;feed&quot; the paper to advance to the next line.

Many electric typewriters such as IBM Electric or Underwood Electric made carriage return to be another key on the keyboard instead of a lever. The key was usually labeled &quot;carriage return&quot;, &quot;return&quot;, or &quot;power return&quot;. With typewriters like the Selectric, where the type element moved when typing and the paper was held stationary, the key returned the type element to the far left and the term &quot;carrier return&quot; was sometimes used for this function.

To improve the keyboard for non-English-speakers, the symbol ↵ (U+21B5, HTML entity codice_2) was introduced to communicate the combined carriage return and line feed action.

==Computers==

In computing, the carriage return is one of the control characters in ASCII code, Unicode, EBCDIC, and many other codes. It commands a printer, or other output system such as the display of a system console, to move the position of the cursor to the first position on the same line. It was mostly used along with line feed (LF), a move to the next line, so that together they start a new line. Together, this sequence can be referred to as CRLF.

The carriage return and line feed functions were split for practical reasons:

* Carriage return by itself provided the ability to overprint the line with new text. This could be used to produce bold or accented characters, underscores, struck-out text, and some composite symbols.
* Early mechanical printers were too slow to return the carriage in the time it took to process one character. Therefore, the time spent sending the line feed was not wasted (often several more characters had to be sent to ensure the carriage return had happened before sending a printing character). This is why the carriage return was always sent first.
* It was then also possible to fit multiple line feed operations into the time taken for a single carriage return—for example for printing doublespaced text, headers/footers or title pages—to save print and transmission time without the need for additional circuitry or mechanical complexity to &quot;filter out&quot; spurious additional CR signals.

As early as 1901, Baudot code contained separate carriage return and line feed characters.

Many computer programs use the carriage return character, alone or with a line feed, to signal the end of a line of text, but other characters are also used for this function (see newline); others use it only for a paragraph break (a &quot;hard return&quot;). Some standards which introduce their own representations for line and paragraph control (for example HTML) and many programming languages treat carriage return and line feed as whitespace.

In both ASCII and Unicode, the carriage return is assigned code point 13 (or 0D in hexadecimal); it may also be seen as control+M or . In character and string constants in the C programming language and in many other languages (including representations of regular expressions) influenced by C, codice_3 denotes this character.

<text>A newline (frequently called line ending, end of line (EOL), next line (NEL) or line break) is a control character or sequence of control characters in character encoding specifications such as ASCII, EBCDIC, Unicode, etc. This character, or a sequence of characters, is used to signify the end of a line of text and the start of a new one.

== History ==
In the mid-1800s, long before the advent of teleprinters and teletype machines, Morse code operators or telegraphists invented and used Morse code prosigns to encode white space text formatting in formal written text messages. In particular, the Morse prosign (mnemonic break text), represented by the concatenation of literal textual Morse codes &quot;B&quot; and &quot;T&quot; characters, sent without the normal inter-character spacing, is used in Morse code to encode and indicate a &quot;new line&quot; or &quot;new section&quot; in a formal text message.

Later, in the age of modern teleprinters, standardized character set control codes were developed to aid in white space text formatting. ASCII was developed simultaneously by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the American Standards Association (ASA), the latter being the predecessor organization to American National Standards Institute (ANSI). During the period of 1963 to 1968, the ISO draft standards supported the use of either + or  alone as a newline, while the ASA drafts supported only +.

The sequence + was commonly used on many early computer systems that had adopted Teletype machines—typically a Teletype Model 33 ASR—as a console device, because this sequence was required to position those printers at the start of a new line. The separation of newline into two functions concealed the fact that the print head could not return from the far right to the beginning of the next line in time to print the next character. Any character printed after a would often print as a smudge in the middle of the page while the print head was still moving the carriage back to the first position. &quot;The solution was to make the newline two characters: to move the carriage to column one, and to move the paper up.&quot; In fact, it was often necessary to send extra padding characters—extraneous CRs or NULs—which are ignored but give the print head time to move to the left margin. Many early video displays also required multiple character times to scroll the display.

On such systems, applications had to talk directly to the Teletype machine and follow its conventions since the concept of device drivers hiding such hardware details from the application was not yet well developed. Therefore, text was routinely composed to satisfy the needs of Teletype machines. Most minicomputer systems from DEC used this convention. CP/M also used it in order to print on the same terminals that minicomputers used. From there MS-DOS (1981) adopted CP/M&#x27;s + in order to be compatible, and this convention was inherited by Microsoft&#x27;s later Windows operating system.

The Multics operating system began development in 1964 and used alone as its newline. Multics used a device driver to translate this character to whatever sequence a printer needed (including extra padding characters), and the single byte was more convenient for programming. What seems like a more obvious choice——was not used, as provided the useful function of overprinting one line with another to create boldface, underscore and strikethrough effects. Perhaps more importantly, the use of alone as a line terminator had already been incorporated into drafts of the eventual ISO/IEC 646 standard. Unix followed the Multics practice, and later Unix-like systems followed Unix. This created conflicts between Windows and Unix-like operating systems, whereby files composed on one operating system could not be properly formatted or interpreted by another operating system (for example a UNIX shell script written in a Windows text editor like Notepad).

== Representation ==
The concepts of carriage return (CR) and line feed (LF) are closely associated and can be considered either separately or together. In the physical media of typewriters and printers, two axes of motion, &quot;down&quot; and &quot;across&quot;, are needed to create a new line on the page. Although the design of a machine (typewriter or printer) must consider them separately, the abstract logic of software can combine them together as one event. This is why a newline in character encoding can be defined as and combined into one (commonly called or ).

Some character sets provide a separate newline character code. EBCDIC, for example, provides an character code in addition to the and codes. Unicode, in addition to providing the ASCII and control codes, also provides a &quot;next line&quot; () control code, as well as control codes for &quot;line separator&quot; and &quot;paragraph separator&quot; markers. Unicode also contains printable characters for visually representing line feed ␊, carriage return ␍, and other C0 control codes (as well as a generic newline, ␤) in the Control Pictures block.

*EBCDIC systems—mainly IBM mainframe systems, including z/OS (OS/390) and IBM i (OS/400)—use (New Line, ) as the character combining the functions of line feed and carriage return. The equivalent Unicode character () is called (Next Line). EBCDIC also has control characters called and , but the numerical value of () differs from the one used by ASCII (). Additionally, some EBCDIC variants also use but assign a different numeric code to the character. However, those operating systems use a record-based file system, which stores text files as one record per line. In most file formats, no line terminators are actually stored.
*Operating systems for the CDC 6000 series defined a newline as two or more zero-valued six-bit characters at the end of a 60-bit word. Some configurations also defined a zero-valued character as a colon character, with the result that multiple colons could be interpreted as a newline depending on position.
*RSX-11 and OpenVMS also use a record-based file system, which stores text files as one record per line. In most file formats, no line terminators are actually stored, but the Record Management Services facility can transparently add a terminator to each line when it is retrieved by an application. The records themselves can contain the same line terminator characters, which can either be considered a feature or a nuisance depending on the application. RMS not only stores records, but also stores metadata about the record separators in different bits for the file to complicate matters even more (since files can have fixed length records, records that are prefixed by a count or records that are terminated by a specific character). The bits are not generic, so while they can specify that or or even is the line terminator, they can not substitute some other code.
*&quot;Fixed line length&quot; was used by some early mainframe operating systems. In such a system, an implicit end-of-line was assumed every 72 or 80 characters, for example. No newline character was stored. If a file was imported from the outside world, lines shorter than the line length had to be padded with spaces, while lines longer than the line length had to be truncated. This mimicked the use of punched cards, on which each line was stored on a separate card, usually with 80 columns on each card, often with sequence numbers in columns 73–80. Many of these systems added a carriage control character to the start of the &quot;next&quot; record; this could indicate whether the next record was a continuation of the line started by the previous record, or a new line, or should overprint the previous line (similar to a ). Often this was a normal printing character such as that thus could not be used as the first character in a line. Some early line printers interpreted these characters directly in the records sent to them.

=== Communication protocols ===
Many communications protocols have some sort of new line convention. In particular, protocols published by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) typically use the ASCII CRLF sequence.

In some older protocols, the new line may be followed by a checksum or parity character.

=== Unicode ===

The Unicode standard defines a number of characters that conforming applications should recognize as line terminators:

:: Line Feed, 
:: Vertical Tab, 
:: Form Feed, 
:: Carriage Return, 
:+: () followed by ()
:: Next Line, 
:: Line Separator, 
:: Paragraph Separator, 

While it may seem overly complicated compared to an approach such as converting all line terminators to a single character (e.g. ), because Unicode is designed to preserve all information when converting a text file from any existing encoding to Unicode and back (round-trip integrity), Unicode needs to make the same distinctions between line breaks made by other encodings. For instance EBCDIC has , , and characters, so all three have to also exist in Unicode.

Most newline characters and sequences are in ASCII&#x27;s C0 controls (i.e. have Unicode code points up to ). The three newline characters outside of this range—, and —are often not recognized as newlines by software. For example:
*ECMAScript accepts and as line breaks, but considers () whitespace instead of a line break.
*JSON allows and characters within strings, while ECMAScript prior to treated them as newlines, and therefore illegal syntax.
*YAML 1.1 recognized all three as line breaks; YAML 1.2 no longer recognizes them as line breaks in order to be compatible with JSON.
*Windows Notepad, the default text editor of Microsoft Windows, does not treat any of , , or as line breaks.
*gedit, the default text editor of the GNOME desktop environment, treats and , but not , as line breaks.

Unicode includes some glyphs intended for presenting a user-visible character to the reader of the document, and are thus not recognized themselves as a newline:
* 
* 

=== In programming languages ===

To facilitate creating portable programs, programming languages provide some abstractions to deal with the different types of newline sequences used in different environments.

The C language provides the escape sequences codice_1 (newline) and codice_2 (carriage return). However, these are not required to be equivalent to the ASCII and control characters. The C standard only guarantees two traits:
# Each of these escape sequences maps to a unique implementation-defined number that can be stored in one value.
# When writing to a file, device node, or socket/fifo in &quot;text mode&quot;, codice_1 is transparently translated to the native newline sequence used by the system, which may be longer than one character. When reading in text mode, the native newline sequence is translated back to codice_1. In &quot;binary mode&quot;, no translation is performed, and the internal representation produced by codice_1 is output directly.

On Unix operating system platforms, where C originated, the native newline sequence is ASCII (), so codice_1 was simply defined to be that value. With the internal and external representation being identical, the translation performed in text mode is a no-op, and Unix has no notion of text mode or binary mode. This has caused many programmers who developed their software on Unix systems simply to ignore the distinction completely, resulting in code that is not portable to different platforms.

The C standard library function is best avoided in binary mode because any file not written with the Unix newline convention will be misread. Also, in text mode, any file not written with the system&#x27;s native newline sequence (such as a file created on a Unix system, then copied to a Windows system) will be misread as well.

Another common problem is the use of codice_1 when communicating using an Internet protocol that mandates the use of ASCII + for ending lines. Writing codice_1 to a text mode stream works correctly on Windows systems, but produces only on Unix, and something completely different on more exotic systems. Using codice_9 in binary mode is slightly better.

Many languages, such as C++, Perl, and Haskell provide the same interpretation of codice_1 as C. C++ has an alternative input/output (I/O) model where the manipulator can be used to output a newline (and flushes the stream buffer).

Java, PHP, and Python provide the codice_9 sequence (for ASCII +). In contrast to C, these are guaranteed to represent the values and , respectively.

The Java Class Library input/output (I/O) methods do not transparently translate these into platform-dependent newline sequences on input or output. Instead, they provide functions for writing a full line that automatically add the native newline sequence, and functions for reading lines that accept any of , , or + as a line terminator (see ). The method can be used to retrieve the underlying line separator.

Example:

 String eol = System.lineSeparator();
 String lineColor = &quot;Color: Red&quot; + eol;
Python permits &quot;Universal Newline Support&quot; when opening a file for reading, when importing modules, and when executing a file.

Some languages have created special variables, constants, and subroutines to facilitate newlines during program execution. In some languages such as PHP and Perl, double quotes are required to perform escape substitution for all escape sequences, including codice_1 and codice_2. In PHP, to avoid portability problems, newline sequences should be issued using the PHP_EOL constant.

Example in C#:

 string eol = Environment.NewLine;
 string lineColor = &quot;Color: Red&quot; + eol;
 string eol2 = &quot;\n&quot;;
 string lineColor2 = &quot;Color: Blue&quot; + eol2;
=== Issues with different newline formats ===

The different newline conventions cause text files that have been transferred between systems of different types to be displayed incorrectly.

Text in files created with programs which are common on Unix-like or classic Mac OS, appear as a single long line on most programs common to MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows because these do not display a single or a single as a line break.

Conversely, when viewing a file originating from a Windows computer on a Unix-like system, the extra may be displayed as a second line break, as , or as at the end of each line.

Furthermore, programs other than text editors may not accept a file, e.g. some configuration file, encoded using the foreign newline convention, as a valid file.

The problem can be hard to spot because some programs handle the foreign newlines properly while others do not. For example, a compiler may fail with obscure syntax errors even though the source file looks correct when displayed on the console or in an editor. Modern text editors generally recognize all flavours of + newlines and allow users to convert between the different standards. Web browsers are usually also capable of displaying text files and websites which use different types of newlines.

Even if a program supports different newline conventions, these features are often not sufficiently labeled, described, or documented. Typically a menu or combo-box enumerating different newline conventions will be displayed to users without an indication if the selection will re-interpret, temporarily convert, or permanently convert the newlines. Some programs will implicitly convert on open, copy, paste, or save—often inconsistently.

Most textual Internet protocols (including HTTP, SMTP, FTP, IRC, and many others) mandate the use of ASCII + (codice_9, ) on the protocol level, but recommend that tolerant applications recognize lone (codice_1, ) as well. Despite the dictated standard, many applications erroneously use the C newline escape sequence codice_1 () instead of the correct combination of carriage return escape and newline escape sequences codice_9 (+) (see section Newline in programming languages above). This accidental use of the wrong escape sequences leads to problems when trying to communicate with systems adhering to the stricter interpretation of the standards instead of the suggested tolerant interpretation. One such intolerant system is the qmail mail transfer agent that actively refuses to accept messages from systems that send bare instead of the required +.

The standard Internet Message Format for email states: &quot;CR and LF MUST only occur together as CRLF; they MUST NOT appear independently in the body&quot;. Differences between SMTP implementations in how they treat bare LF and/or bare CR characters have led to SMTP spoofing attacks referred to as &quot;SMTP smuggling&quot;.

The File Transfer Protocol can automatically convert newlines in files being transferred between systems with different newline representations when the transfer is done in &quot;ASCII mode&quot;. However, transferring binary files in this mode usually has disastrous results: any occurrence of the newline byte sequence—which does not have line terminator semantics in this context, but is just part of a normal sequence of bytes—will be translated to whatever newline representation the other system uses, effectively corrupting the file. FTP clients often employ some heuristics (for example, inspection of filename extensions) to automatically select either binary or ASCII mode, but in the end it is up to users to make sure their files are transferred in the correct mode. If there is any doubt as to the correct mode, binary mode should be used, as then no files will be altered by FTP, though they may display incorrectly.

=== Conversion between newline formats ===
Text editors are often used for converting a text file between different newline formats; most modern editors can read and write files using at least the different ASCII / conventions.

For example, the editor Vim can make a file compatible with the Windows Notepad text editor. Within vim

 :set fileformat=dos
 :wq

Editors can be unsuitable for converting larger files or bulk conversion of many files. For larger files (on Windows NT) the following command is often used:

D:\&gt;TYPE unix_file | FIND /V &quot;&quot; &gt; dos_file

Special purpose programs to convert files between different newline conventions include and, and , and , and .
The command is available on virtually every Unix-like system and can be used to perform arbitrary replacement operations on single characters. A DOS/Windows text file can be converted to Unix format by simply removing all ASCII characters with
 $ tr -d &#x27;\r&#x27; &lt; &quot;inputfile&quot; &gt; &quot;outputfile&quot;
or, if the text has only newlines, by converting all newlines to with
 $ tr &#x27;\r&#x27; &#x27;\n&#x27; &lt; &quot;inputfile&quot; &gt; &quot;outputfile&quot;

The same tasks are sometimes performed with awk, sed, or in Perl if the platform has a Perl interpreter:

$ awk &#x27;{sub(&quot;$&quot;,&quot;\r\n&quot;); printf(&quot;%s&quot;,$0);}&#x27; inputfile &gt; outputfile # UNIX to DOS (adding CRs on Linux and BSD based OS that haven&#x27;t GNU extensions)
$ awk &#x27;{gsub(&quot;\r&quot;,&quot;&quot;); print;}&#x27; inputfile &gt; outputfile # DOS to UNIX (removing CRs on Linux and BSD based OS that haven&#x27;t GNU extensions)
$ sed -e &#x27;s/$/\r/&#x27; inputfile &gt; outputfile # UNIX to DOS (adding CRs on Linux based OS that use GNU extensions)
$ sed -e &#x27;s/\r$//&#x27; inputfile &gt; outputfile # DOS to UNIX (removing CRs on Linux based OS that use GNU extensions)
$ perl -pe &#x27;s/\r?\n|\r/\r\n/g&#x27; inputfile &gt; outputfile # Convert to DOS
$ perl -pe &#x27;s/\r?\n|\r/\n/g&#x27; inputfile &gt; outputfile # Convert to UNIX
$ perl -pe &#x27;s/\r?\n|\r/\r/g&#x27; inputfile &gt; outputfile # Convert to old Mac

The command can identify the type of line endings:

 $ file myfile.txt
 myfile.txt: ASCII English text, with CRLF line terminators

The Unix egrep (extended grep) command can be used to print filenames of Unix or DOS files (assuming Unix and DOS-style files only, no classic Mac OS-style files):

$ egrep -L &#x27;\r\n&#x27; myfile.txt # show UNIX style file (LF terminated)
$ egrep -l &#x27;\r\n&#x27; myfile.txt # show DOS style file (CRLF terminated)
Other tools permit the user to visualise the EOL characters:

$ od -a myfile.txt
$ cat -e myfile.txt
$ cat -v myfile.txt
$ hexdump -c myfile.txt
== Interpretation ==
Two ways to view newlines, both of which are self-consistent, are that newlines either &quot;separate&quot; lines or that they &quot;terminate&quot; lines. If a newline is considered a separator, there will be no newline after the last line of a file. Some programs have problems processing the last line of a file if it is not terminated by a newline. On the other hand, programs that expect newline to be used as a separator will interpret a final newline as starting a new (empty) line. Conversely, if a newline is considered a terminator, all text lines including the last are expected to be terminated by a newline. If the final character sequence in a text file is not a newline, the final line of the file may be considered to be an improper or incomplete text line, or the file may be considered to be improperly truncated.

In text intended primarily to be read by humans using software which implements the word wrap feature, a newline character typically only needs to be stored if a line break is required independent of whether the next word would fit on the same line, such as between paragraphs and in vertical lists. Therefore, in the logic of word processing and most text editors, newline is used as a &quot;paragraph break&quot; and is known as a &quot;hard return&quot;, in contrast to &quot;soft returns&quot; which are dynamically created to implement word wrapping and are changeable with each display instance. In many applications a separate control character called &quot;manual line break&quot; exists for forcing line breaks inside a single paragraph. The glyph for the control character for a hard return is usually a pilcrow (¶), and for the manual line break is usually a carriage return arrow (↵).

== Reverse and partial line feeds ==
 (U+008D REVERSE LINE FEED, ISO/IEC 6429 8D, decimal 141) is used to move the printing position back one line (by reverse feeding the paper, or by moving a display cursor up one line) so that other characters may be printed over existing text. This may be done to make them bolder, or to add underlines, strike-throughs or other characters such as diacritics.

Similarly, (U+008B PARTIAL LINE FORWARD, decimal 139) and (U+008C PARTIAL LINE BACKWARD, decimal 140) can be used to advance or reverse the text printing position by some fraction of the vertical line spacing (typically, half). These can be used in combination for subscripts (by advancing and then reversing) and superscripts (by reversing and then advancing), and may also be useful for printing diacritics.

<text>A ghostwriter is a person hired to write literary or journalistic works, speeches, or other texts that are putatively credited to another person as the author. Celebrities, executives, participants in timely news stories, and political leaders often hire ghostwriters to draft or edit autobiographies, memoirs, magazine articles, or other written material.

Memoir ghostwriters often pride themselves in &quot;disappearing&quot; when impersonating others since such disappearance signals the quality of their craftsmanship. In music, ghostwriters are often used to write songs, lyrics, and instrumental pieces. Screenplay authors can also use ghostwriters to either edit or rewrite their scripts to improve them. Usually, there is a confidentiality clause in the contract between the ghostwriter and the credited author (or publisher) that obligates the former to remain anonymous, or obligates the latter to not reveal the ghostwriter. Sometimes the ghostwriter is acknowledged by the author or publisher for their writing services, euphemistically called a &quot;researcher&quot; or &quot;research assistant&quot;, but often the ghostwriter is not credited.

Ghostwriting (or simply &quot;ghosting&quot;) also occurs in other creative fields. Composers have long hired ghostwriters to help them to write musical pieces and songs; Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is an example of a well-known composer who was paid to ghostwrite music for wealthy patrons. Ghosting also occurs in popular music. A pop music ghostwriter writes lyrics and a melody in the style of the credited musician. In hip hop music, the increasing use of ghostwriters by high-profile hip-hop stars has led to controversy. In the visual arts, it is not uncommon in both fine art and commercial art such as comics for a number of assistants to do work on a piece that is credited to a single artist; Andy Warhol engaged in this practice, supervising an assembly line silk screen process for his artwork. However, when credit is established for the writer, the acknowledgment of their contribution is public domain and the writer in question would not be considered a ghostwriter.

==Overview==
A consultant or career-switcher may pay a ghostwriter to write a book on a topic in their professional area, to establish or enhance credibility as an expert in their field. Public officials and politicians employ &quot;correspondence officers&quot; to respond to the large volume of official correspondence. A number of papal encyclicals have been written by ghostwriters. A controversial and scientifically unethical practice is medical ghostwriting, where biotech or pharmaceutical companies pay professional writers to produce papers and then recruit (via payment or as a perk) other scientists or physicians to attach their names to these articles before they are published in medical or scientific journals. Some university and college students hire ghostwriters from essay mills to write entrance essays, term papers, theses, and dissertations. This is largely considered unethical unless the actual ghostwriting work is just light editing.

Ghostwriters are hired for numerous reasons. In many cases, celebrities or public figures do not have the time, discipline, or writing skills to write and research a several hundred-page autobiography or &quot;how-to&quot; book. Even if a celebrity or public figure has the writing skills to pen a short article, they may not know how to structure and edit a several hundred-page book so that it is captivating and well-paced. In other cases, publishers use ghostwriters to increase the number of books that can be published each year under the name of well-known, highly marketable authors, or to quickly release a topical book that ties in with a recent or upcoming newsworthy event.

==Remuneration and credit==
Ghostwriters will often spend from several months to a full year researching, writing, and editing non-fiction and fiction works for a client, and they are paid based on a price per hour, per word, or per page, with a flat fee, a percentage of the royalties of the sales, or some combination thereof. In 2013, literary agent Madeleine Morel stated that the average ghostwriter&#x27;s advance for work for major book publishers was &quot;between $40,000 and $70,000&quot;. These benchmark prices are mirrored approximately in the film industry by the Writers Guild, where a Minimum Basic Agreement gives a starting price for the screenplay writer of $37,073 (non-original screenplay, no treatment).

However, the recent shift into the digital age (15–20% world market share of books by 2015) has brought some changes, by opening newer markets that bring their own opportunities for authors and writers—especially on the more affordable side of the ghostwriting business. One such market is the shorter book, best represented at the moment by Amazon&#x27;s Kindle Singles imprint: texts of 30,000 words and under. Such a length would have been much harder to sell before digital reader-technologies became widely available, but is now quite acceptable. Writers on the level of Ian McEwan have celebrated this recent change, mainly for artistic reasons.

As a consequence, the shorter format makes a project potentially more affordable for the client/author. Manhattan Literary, a ghostwriting company, states that &quot;book projects on the shorter side, tailored to new markets like the Kindle Singles imprint and others (30,000–42,000 words) start at a cost of $15,000&quot;. And this shorter book appears to be here to stay. It was once financially impractical for publishers to produce such novella-length texts (they would have to charge too much); but this new market is, by 2015, already substantial and has been projected to be a solid part of the future of book publishing. So, with its appearance the starting price for the professional book writer has come down by about half, but only if this shorter format makes sense for the client.

On the upper end of the spectrum, with celebrities that can all but guarantee a publisher large sales, the fees can be much higher. In 2001, &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that the fee that the ghostwriter for Hillary Clinton&#x27;s memoirs would receive was probably about $500,000 of her book&#x27;s $8 million advance, which &quot;is near the top of flat fees paid to collaborators&quot;.

A recent availability also exists, of outsourcing many kinds of jobs, including ghostwriting, to offshore locations like India, China, and the Philippines where the customer can save money. The true tests of credibility—the writer&#x27;s track record, and samples of his or her craft—become even more important in these instances, when the writer comes from a culture and first language that are entirely different from the client&#x27;s.

In some cases, ghostwriters are allowed to share credit. For example, a common method is to put the client/author&#x27;s name on a book cover as the main byline (by [a&quot;uthor&#x27;s name&quot;]) and then to put the ghostwriter&#x27;s name underneath it (with [g&quot;hostwriter&#x27;s name&quot;]). Sometimes this is done in lieu of pay or to decrease the amount of payment to the book ghostwriter for whom the credit has its own intrinsic value. Also, the ghostwriter can be cited as a co-author of a book, or listed in the movie or film credits when having ghostwritten the script or screenplay for film production.

For nonfiction books, the ghostwriter may be credited as a &quot;contributor&quot; or a &quot;research assistant&quot;. In other cases, the ghostwriter receives no official credit for writing a book or article; in cases where the credited author or the publisher or both wish to conceal the ghostwriter&#x27;s role, the ghostwriter may be asked to sign a nondisclosure contract that legally forbids any mention of the writer&#x27;s role in a project. Some have made the distinction between &quot;author&quot; and &quot;writer&quot;, as ghostwriter Kevin Anderson explains in a &quot;Washington Post&quot; interview: &quot;A ghostwriter is an interpreter and a translator, not an author, which is why our clients deserve full credit for authoring their books.&quot;

==Types==

===Nonfiction===
Ghostwriters are widely used by celebrities and public figures who wish to publish their autobiographies or memoirs. The degree of involvement of the ghostwriter in nonfiction writing projects ranges from minor to substantial. In some cases, a ghostwriter may be called in just to clean up, edit, and polish a rough draft of an autobiography or a &quot;how-to&quot; book. In other cases, the ghostwriter will write an entire book or article based on information, stories, notes, an outline, or interview sessions with the celebrity or public figure. The credited author also indicates to the ghostwriter what type of style, tone, or &quot;voice&quot; they want in the book.

In some cases, such as with some &quot;how-to&quot; books, diet guides, or cookbooks, a book will be entirely written by a ghostwriter, and the celebrity (e.g., a well-known musician or sports star) will be credited as author. Publishing companies use this strategy to increase the marketability of a book by associating it with a celebrity or well-known figure. In several countries before elections, candidates commission ghostwriters to produce autobiographies for them so as to gain visibility and exposure. One of John F. Kennedy&#x27;s books (&quot;Profiles in Courage&quot;) is almost entirely credited to ghostwriters. Donald Trump&#x27;s autobiography &quot;&quot; was produced by a ghostwriter. Several of Hillary Clinton&#x27;s books were produced by ghostwriters. Nelson Mandela&#x27;s autobiography (&quot;Long Walk to Freedom&quot;) was also produced by a ghostwriter.
A consultant or career-switcher may pay to have a book ghostwritten on a topic in their professional area, to establish or enhance their credibility as an &quot;expert&quot; in their field. For example, a successful salesperson hoping to become a motivational speaker on selling may pay a ghostwriter to write a book on sales techniques. Often this type of book is published by a self-publishing press (or &quot;vanity press&quot;), which means that the author is paying to have the book published. This type of book is typically given away to prospective clients as a promotional tool, rather than being sold in bookstores.

===Fiction===
Ghostwriters are employed by fiction publishers for several reasons. In some cases, publishers use ghostwriters to increase the number of books that can be published each year by a well-known, highly marketable author. Ghostwriters mostly pen fictional works for well-known &quot;name&quot; authors in genres such as detective fiction, mysteries, and teen fiction.

Additionally, publishers use ghostwriters to write new books for established series where the &quot;author&quot; is a pseudonym. For example, the purported authors of the Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys mysteries, &quot;Carolyn Keene&quot; and &quot;Franklin W. Dixon&quot;, respectively, are actually pseudonyms for a series of ghostwriters who write books in the same style using a template of basic information about the book&#x27;s characters and their fictional universe (names, dates, speech patterns), and about the tone and style that are expected in the book (for more information, see pseudonyms and pen names). In addition, ghostwriters are often given copies of several of the previous books in the series to help them match the style.

The estate of gothic novelist V. C. Andrews hired ghostwriter Andrew Neiderman to continue writing novels after her death, under her name and in a similar style to her original works. Many of action writer Tom Clancy&#x27;s books from the 2000s bear the names of two people on their covers, with Clancy&#x27;s name in larger print and the other author&#x27;s name in smaller print. Various books bearing Clancy&#x27;s name were written by different authors under the same pseudonym. The first two books in the &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Splinter Cell&quot; franchise were written by Raymond Benson under the pseudonym David Michaels.

Sometimes famous authors will ghostwrite for other celebrities, such as when H. P. Lovecraft ghostwrote &quot;Imprisoned with the Pharaohs&quot; (also known as &quot;Under the Pyramids&quot;) for Harry Houdini in &quot;Weird Tales&quot; in the 1920s.

===Religious===
A number of papal encyclicals have been written by ghostwriters. &quot;Pascendi&quot;, for instance, was written by Joseph Lemius (1860–1923), the procurator in Rome of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate. In June 1938, Pius XI summoned American Jesuit John La Farge, who began to prepare a draft of &quot;Humani generis unitas&quot;, which LaFarge and two other Jesuits—Gustav Gundlach and Gustave Desbuquois—on in Paris; the draft was approximately 100 pages long. Another Jesuit translated the draft encyclical into Latin, presenting it to Wlodimir Ledóchowski, then the General of the Society of Jesus who had chosen Gundlach and Desbuquois for the project. The draft encyclical was delivered to the Vatican in September 1938. Sebastian Tromp, a Dutch Jesuit, a Thomist theologian and close to Pius XII, is considered to be the main ghostwriter of &quot;Mystici corporis&quot;.

Michel-Louis Guérard des Lauriers, one of the Vatican&#x27;s leading theologians of that time, was responsible for the critical study of the New Mass of Pope Paul VI, commonly known as the Ottaviani Intervention, after the supposed attribution to Cardinals Alfredo Ottaviani and Antonio Bacci. The Vatican later answered these accusations and Cardinal Ottaviani later regretted that his name was misused to berate the pope, of which, his questions about the Pauline Mass were already clarified.

===Academic===
Ghostwriting is considered to be academic dishonesty and can lead to repercussions if detected by universities, although it is not illegal in the United States, United Kingdom and Germany.

There are ghostwriting companies and freelancers that sell entrance essays, term papers, theses and dissertations to students. Such services are commonly known as &quot;essay mills&quot;.

Although academic ghostwriting involves the sale of academic texts that are written on demand, it differs from plagiarism in that it does not involve an undisclosed appropriation of existing texts. As opposed to cases of plagiarism that stem from a copy-and-paste reuse of previous work, essays and assignments that are obtained through ghostwriting services as a rule have the originality of their text confirmed by plagiarism detection software packages or online services that are widely used by universities.

Universities have developed strategies to combat such academic services, which can be associated with academic fraud, that are offered to students and researchers. Some universities allow professors to give students oral examinations on papers which a professor believes to be ghostwritten. If the student is unfamiliar with the content of an essay that he or she has submitted, then the student can be charged with academic fraud.

===Medical===

With medical ghostwriting, pharmaceutical companies pay professional writers to produce papers and then pay other scientists or physicians to attach their names to these papers before they are published in medical or scientific journals. Medical ghostwriting has been criticized by a variety of professional organizations representing the drug industry, publishers, and medical societies, and it may violate American laws prohibiting off-label promotion by drug manufacturers as well as anti-kickback provisions within the statutes governing Medicare. Recently, it has attracted scrutiny from the lay press and from lawmakers, as well. including the University of Washington School of Medicine, while it is prohibited and considered a particularly pernicious form of plagiarism at others, such as Tufts University School of Medicine.

Professional medical writers can write papers without being listed as authors of the paper and without being considered ghostwriters, provided their role is acknowledged. The European Medical Writers Association have published guidelines which aim to ensure professional medical writers carry out this role in an ethical and responsible manner. The use of properly acknowledged medical writers is accepted as legitimate by organisations such as the World Association of Medical Editors and the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot;. Moreover, professional medical writers&#x27; expertise in presenting scientific data may be of benefit in producing better quality papers.

===Website===
Some websites, including blogs, are ghostwritten, because not all authors have the information technology skills or the time to dedicate to running a website. Nonetheless, the style, tone and content is modeled on that of the credited author. Many website ghostwriters are freelance but some are freelancers who work under contract, as with radio presenters and television presenters. Occasionally a &quot;house pseudonym&quot;, or collective name is used by the author of the website.

Some celebrities, executives, or public figures set up blog websites—sometimes as a marketing, public relations, or lobbying tool. However, since these individuals are typically too busy to write their blog posts, they hire discreet ghostwriters to post to the blog under the celebrity or executive&#x27;s name. As with nonfiction ghostwriting, the blog ghostwriter models their writing style, content and tone on that of the credited author. This goes for social media as well. Many public figures have ghostwriters at least partially handle their Facebook and Twitter accounts, among others.

===Music===

====Classical music and film scores====

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is an example of a well-known composer who was paid to ghostwrite music for wealthy patrons. In the film industry, a music ghostwriter is a &quot;person who composes music for another composer but is not credited on the cue sheet or in the final product in any way.&quot; The practice is considered one of the &quot;dirty little secrets of the film and television music business&quot; that is considered unethical, but has been common since the early stages of the film industry. In the early years of film, David Raksin worked as music ghostwriter and orchestrator for Charlie Chaplin; even though Chaplin was credited as the score writer, he was considered to be a &quot;hummer&quot; (pejorative film industry slang for a person who purports to be a film score composer but who in fact only gives a general idea of the melodies to a ghostwriter).

The practice is also common in television, as composers listed on cue sheets are entitled to music royalties every time an episode or theme score appears on television. A 1998 investigation by &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; revealed that it was especially prevalent among animation companies such as Saban Entertainment, DiC, Ruby-Spears Productions and Hanna-Barbera, which often listed company executives as musicians for the purpose of royalties. In the late 1990s, several composers threatened a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against Saban Entertainment president Haim Saban, for allegedly taking ownership and credit for their musical compositions.

====Popular music====
Musical ghostwriting also occurs in popular music. When a record company wants to market an inexperienced young singer as a singer-songwriter, or help a veteran bandleader coping with writer&#x27;s block (or a lack of motivation to finish the next album), an experienced songwriter may be discreetly brought in to help. In other cases, a ghostwriter writes lyrics and a melody in the style of the credited musician, with little or no input from the credited musician. A ghostwriter providing this type of service may be thanked, without reference to the service provided, in the album credits, or they may be a true &#x27;ghost&#x27;, with no acknowledgement in the album.

Legal disputes have arisen when musical ghostwriters have tried to claim royalties when an allegedly ghostwritten song becomes a money-making hit. In 1987, Darryl Neudorf was asked to work on a project for Nettwerk Productions involving newly signed artist Sarah McLachlan. This recording, the album &quot;Touch&quot;, resulted in garnering the interest of Arista Records. She signed a multi-album contract with them and two of the songs that Neudorf worked on with her became commercial hits in Canada. In 1991, Neudorf was invited to work with McLachlan again on her second album, &quot;Solace&quot;. In 1993, he filed a lawsuit against McLachlan and her label, alleging that he had made a significant and uncredited contribution to the songwriting on &quot;Touch&quot;, and alleging that he was not paid properly for work done on &quot;Solace&quot;. The judge in the suit eventually ruled in McLachlan&#x27;s favour on the songs; stating that although Neudorf may have contributed to the songwriting, neither regarded each other as joint authors. The judge ruled in Neudorf&#x27;s favour on the payment issue.
In hip hop music, the increasing use of ghostwriters by high-profile hip hop stars has led to controversy. Critics view the increasing use of hip hop ghostwriters as the &quot;perversion of hip-hop by commerce.&quot; This is because of the limiting definition of &quot;rapping&quot; as &quot;expressing yourself through your own words, not someone else&#x27;s.&quot; Chuck D of Public Enemy thinks this point of view is mistaken because &quot;not everyone is equipped to be a lyricist and not everyone is equipped to be a vocalist.&quot; He points out that creating a rap song may require multiple talents. Frank Ocean started his career as a ghostwriter for artists such as Justin Bieber, John Legend and Brandy.

Currently in hip-hop, the credit given to ghostwriters varies: &quot;silent pens might sign confidentiality clauses, appear obliquely in the liner notes, or discuss their participation freely.&quot; In some cases, liner notes credit individuals for &quot;vocal arrangement&quot;, which may be a euphemism for ghostwriting. In the early 2010s, hip-hop ghostwriting services like Rap Rebirth appeared online, which provide recording artists who wish to purchase ghostwritten rhymes a greater degree of anonymity.

===Visual art===
Ghost authorship also applies to the visual arts, most commonly paintings. The extent of the master artist&#x27;s contribution varies widely, as little as composition adjustments and corrective brush strokes, or as much as entire works. A common practice is the use of art instruction class milieu in which the master artist makes significant contributions to the work of the student who then signs that work as his or her own. Services addressing complete works have historically been highly confidential. Less prevalent are advertised commercial services which may use the term &quot;vanity artwork&quot; as suggestive of &quot;vanity publishing&quot;.

===As blacklisting countermeasure===
In countries where freedom of speech is not upheld and authors that have somehow displeased the ruling regime are &quot;blacklisted&quot; (i.e. forbidden from having their works published), the blacklisted authors or composers may ghostwrite material for other authors or composers who are in the good graces of the regime. Examples include:
* Carl Foreman and Michael Wilson for &quot;Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; (credited to Pierre Boulle, who wrote the novel).
* Dalton Trumbo for &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; (credited to Ian McLellan Hunter).

==In culture==
Movies and novels about ghostwriters include:

* Philip Roth&#x27;s 1979 novel &quot;The Ghost Writer&quot;
* Chico Buarque&#x27;s 2003 novel &quot;Budapeste&quot; about the tribulations of José Costa, its protagonist, between Rio de Janeiro and Budapest

* Jason Reitman&#x27;s 2011 comedy-drama film &quot;Young Adult&quot;
* The plot of the first season of the animated comedy-drama &quot;BoJack Horseman&quot; involves the title character BoJack dictating his memoirs to Diane Nguyen, a ghostwriter assigned by his publisher.
* David Mitchell&#x27;s first novel &quot;Ghostwritten&quot; (1999) plays on the notion of characters ghostwriting their own lives.
* Haruki Murakami&#x27;s 2009 novel &quot;1Q84&quot;, in which one of the main plot lines revolves around a ghostwriter.
* Kyoto Animation&#x27;s 2018 anime television series, &quot;Violet Evergarden&quot;, as well as the light novel of the same name, written by Kana Akatsuki.
* Andrew Unger&#x27;s 2020 novel &quot;Once Removed&quot;

<text>ThinkPad is a line of business-oriented laptop and tablet computers produced since 1992. The early models were designed, created and manufactured by International Business Machines (IBM) until it sold its PC business to Lenovo in 2005; since 2007, all new ThinkPad models have been branded Lenovo instead and the Chinese manufacturer has continued to develop and sell ThinkPads to the present day.

The ThinkPad line was first developed at the IBM Yamato Facility in Japan; they have a distinct black, boxy design, which originated in 1990 and is still used in some models. Most models also feature a red-colored trackpoint on the keyboard, which has become an iconic and distinctive design characteristic associated with the ThinkPad line. It has seen significant success in the business market while certain models target students and the education market. ThinkPad laptops have been used in outer space and for many years were the only laptops certified for use on the International Space Station (ISS). ThinkPads have also for several years been one of the preferred laptops used by the United Nations.

== History ==
IBM was the last of the major personal computer manufacturers to enter the notebook market, launching the PS/2 Note in 1992; its earlier laptop models did not gain significant attention. Building on the PS/2 Note, the ThinkPad was developed to compete with Compaq in the United States, whose LTE was the first commercially successful notebook PC; as well as Apple Computer&#x27;s highly successful PowerBook, and Toshiba in Japan, whose Dynabook series of notebooks were similarly successful. IBM signed a lucrative contract with the Harvard Business School to provide the campus with notebook PCs. The task of creating a notebook was given to the Yamato Facility in Japan, headed by , a Japanese engineer and product designer who had joined IBM in the 1970s, now known as the &quot;Father of ThinkPad&quot;. 

The name &quot;ThinkPad&quot; was a product of IBM&#x27;s corporate history and culture. Thomas J. Watson Sr. first introduced &quot;Think&quot; as an IBM slogan in the 1920s. With every minicomputer and mainframe IBM installed (almost all were leased – not sold), a plastic sign with the text &quot;Think&quot; printed on an aluminum plate was placed atop the operator&#x27;s console.

For decades, IBM had also distributed small notepads with the word &quot;THINK&quot; emblazoned on their cover to customers and employees. The name &quot;ThinkPad&quot; was suggested by IBM employee Denny Wainwright, who had one such notepad in his pocket. The name was opposed by the IBM corporate naming committee as all the names for IBM computers were numeric at that time, but &quot;ThinkPad&quot; was kept due to praise from journalists and the public.

===Early models===
In April 1992, IBM announced the first ThinkPad models, the 300, 700, and 700C all released on October 5, 1992. The 700T released in 1993 was a tablet computer.

This machine was the first product produced under IBM&#x27;s new &quot;differentiated product personality&quot; strategy, a collaboration between Richard Sapper and Tom Hardy, head of the corporate IBM Design Program. Development of the 700C also involved a close working relationship between Sapper and Kazuhiko Yamazaki, lead notebook designer at IBM&#x27;s Yamato Design Center in Japan and liaison between Sapper and Yamato engineering.

This 1990–1992 &quot;pre-Internet&quot; collaboration between Italy and Japan was facilitated by a special Sony digital communications system that transmitted high-res images over telephone lines. This system was established in several key global Design Centers by Hardy so IBM designers could visually communicate more effectively and interact directly with Sapper for advice on their projects. For his innovative design management leadership during ThinkPad development, Hardy was named &quot;Innovator of the Year 1992&quot; by PC Magazine.

The first ThinkPad tablet, a PenPoint-based device formally known as the IBM ThinkPad 2521, was positioned as a developer&#x27;s release. The ThinkPad tablet became available for purchase by the general public, as the 700T, in October of the same year.

IBM marketed the ThinkPad creatively, through methods such as early customer pilot programs, numerous pre-launch announcements, and an extensive loaner program designed to showcase the product&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses, including loaning a machine to archaeologists excavating the ancient Egyptian city of Leontopolis. The resulting report documented the ThinkPad&#x27;s excellent performance under difficult conditions; &quot;The ThinkPad is an impressive machine, rugged enough to be used without special care in the worst conditions Egypt has to offer.&quot; The positive critical and commercial reception of the ThinkPad played a key part in reversing IBM&#x27;s fortunes.

The first ThinkPads were very successful, collecting more than 300+ awards for design and quality.

===Acquisition by Lenovo===

In 2005, Lenovo purchased the IBM personal computer business and the ThinkPad as a flagship brand along with it. Lenovo founder Liu Chuanzhi said, &quot;We benefited in three ways from the IBM acquisition. We got the ThinkPad brand, IBM&#x27;s more advanced PC manufacturing technology and the company&#x27;s international resources, such as its global sales channels and operation teams. These three elements have shored up our sales revenue in the past several years.&quot;

Although Lenovo acquired the right to use the IBM brand name for five years after it acquired IBM&#x27;s personal computer business, it was only used for three years. In 2012 Lenovo manufactured and marketed Think-branded products while IBM was mostly responsible for overseeing servicing and repairs for them. At that time both IBM and Lenovo played a key role in the design of their &quot;Think&quot; branded products.

===Manufacturing===
The majority of ThinkPad computers since the 2005 acquisition of the brand by Lenovo have been made in Mexico, Slovakia, India, and China. Lenovo employs ~300 people at a combined manufacturing and distribution center near its American headquarters. Each device made in this facility is labeled with a red-white-and-blue sticker proclaiming &quot;Whitsett, North Carolina.&quot; 

In 2012, Lenovo produced a short run of special edition anniversary ThinkPads in Yonezawa, Yamagata, Japan, in partnership with NEC, as part of a larger goal to move manufacturing away from China and into Japan.

In 2014, although sales rose 5.6 percent from the previous year, Lenovo lost its position as the top commercial notebook maker. However, the company celebrated a milestone in 2015 with the shipment of the 100 millionth unit of its ThinkPad line.

In 2017, Lenovo launched a ThinkPad model to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the ThinkPad brand. It is based on the T470 and uses the similar keyboard to the 700C.

In 2022, Lenovo launched the ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 10 Special Edition to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the ThinkPad brand.

In 2023, Lenovo launched ThinkPad X1 Carbon 12 edition. 

In late 2024, Lenovo launched ThinkPad Carbon 13 Aura which is an upgrade from the previous Carbon 12 edition. 

== Design ==

The appearance of the ThinkPad has remained very similar throughout the entire lifetime of the brand. Almost all models are solid black inside and out, with a boxy case design. Some newer Lenovo models incorporate more curved lines. Many ThinkPads utilize magnesium, carbon fiber reinforced plastic, or titanium in their chassis.

The industrial design concept was created in 1990 by Italy-based designer Richard Sapper, a corporate design consultant of IBM and, since 2005, Lenovo. The design was based on the concept of a traditional Japanese &quot;bento&quot; lunchbox, which revealed its nature only after being opened. According to later interviews with Sapper, he also characterized the simple ThinkPad form to be as elementary as a simple, black cigar box and with similar proportions, with the same observation that it offers a &#x27;surprise&#x27; when opened.

Since 1992, the ThinkPad design has been regularly updated, developed, and refined over the years by Sapper and the respective teams at IBM and later Lenovo. On the occasion of the 20th anniversary of ThinkPad&#x27;s introduction, David Hill authored and designed a commemorative book about ThinkPad design titled &quot;ThinkPad Design: Spirit &amp; Essence&quot;.
== Features and technologies ==

Several unique features have appeared in the ThinkPad line, like drive protection, a TrackPoint, or Trusted Platform Module chips.

While few features remain unique to the series, several laptop technologies originated on ThinkPads:

===Current===
* Lenovo Vantage
Earlier known as &quot;IBM Access&quot;, later &quot;ThinkVantage&quot;, the Lenovo Vantage is a suite of computer management applications. This software can give additional support for system management (backup, encrypting, system drivers installation and upgrade, system monitoring and others). Currently, some old features have been replaced by internal Windows 10/11 features.

*TPM chips
IBM was the first company that supported a Trusted Platform Module (TPM). Modern ThinkPads still have this feature.

*ThinkShutter
&quot;ThinkShutter&quot; is the branding of a webcam privacy shutter present in some ThinkPad notebook computers. It is a simple mechanical sliding cover that allows the user to obstruct the webcam&#x27;s view. Some add-on webcams and other laptop brands provide a similar feature. IdeaPad notebooks carry the TrueBlock branding for their privacy shutters.

*Spill-resistant keyboards
All ThinkPad models have a keyboard membrane and drain holes (L series, P series, E series, T series, X series, X1 series, and Z series models), and some have a solid rubber or plastic membrane (like L series, W series, X1 series, and current T and X series), without draining holes.
*UltraNav
The first ThinkPad 700 was equipped with the signature TrackPoint red dot pointing stick invented by Ted Selker. By 2000 the trackpad pointer had become more popular for laptops due to innovations by Synaptics so IBM introduced UltraNav as a complementary combination of TrackPoint and TouchPad designed by Dave Sawin, Hiroaki Yasuda, Fusanobo Nakamura, and Mitsuo Horiuchi to please all users.

*A roll cage frame and stainless steel hinges with 180° or 360° opening angle
The &quot;roll cage&quot; is an internal frame, designed to minimize motherboard flex (current P series and T##p series) or magnesium composite case (all other hi-end models). The display modules lack magnesium frames, and some 2012-2016 models have a common issue with a cracked plastic lid. The 180° hinges are typical, the 360° hinges are a Yoga line basic feature.

*OLED screens
Introduced in 2016 as a high-end display option for some models.

*Active Protection System
Hard-drive protection for some ThinkPad models that still use the 2.5&quot; drive bay; These systems use an accelerometer sensor to detect when a ThinkPad is falling and shut down the hard disk drive to prevent damage.

*Biometric fingerprint reader and NFC smart card reader options
The fingerprint reader was introduced as an option by IBM in 2004. ThinkPads were one of the first laptops to include this feature.

*Internal WWAN modules and Wi-Fi 3x3 MIMO
The Mobile broadband support is a common feature for most of the actual ThinkPad models after 2006; the support of 3x3 MIMO is a common feature for most high-end models.

Some additional features (dock stations, UltraBay, accessories support) were listed in the Accessories section.

===Past===

*ThinkLight
External keyboard light, replaced by internal backlight; is an LED light located at the top of the LCD screen which illuminates the keyboard from above.

*Power Bridge
Some E, L, T, X, W (only W550s), and P (only P##s) series ThinkPads feature (for some 2013-2018 models) — internal secondary battery (as a succession of secondary UltraBay battery) that support a hot-swapping of primary battery.


*7-row Keyboards
:Original IBM keyboard design (1992–2012) — The original keyboard was offered in the ThinkPad line until 2012, when it was swapped out for the chiclet-style keyboard now used today.
::IBM TrackWrite keyboard design — A unique keyboard designed by John Karidis introduced by IBM in 1995, used in the ThinkPad 701 series. When the machine is closed the keyboard is folded inwards, making the machine more compact. However, when the machine is open and in use, it slides out, giving the user a normal-sized keyboard. That keyboard, referred to as a butterfly keyboard, which is widely considered a design masterpiece and is in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.

:The ThinkPad 760 series also included an unusual keyboard design; the keyboard was elevated by two arms riding on small rails on the side of the screen, tilting the keyboard to achieve a more ergonomic design.

The keyboard design was replaced by the Chiclet style keyboard (2012-current) in 2012. The chiclet-style keyboard does not support the ThinkLight for illumination, instead using a keyboard backlight. Some ThinkPad models during the intermission period between the classic IBM design and the Lenovo chiclet design could be outfitted with both the backlit chiclet-style keyboard and the ThinkLight.

*FlexView advanced fringe field switching or in-plane switching screens
The introduced in 2004 line of hi-end displays with wide view angles and optional high resolution (up to 15&quot; 1600x1200 or (rarely) 2048x1536 pixels). Partially dropped in 2008 (after the partial defunct of BOE-Hydis display supplier), and reintroduced as an ordinary IPS screen option in 2013.

===Batteries===
Some ThinkPad laptops (such as the X230/X230t, T430s/T430 and T530/W530, all from 2012) block third-party batteries. Lenovo calls this feature &quot;Battery Safeguard&quot;. It was first introduced on some models in May 2012. Laptops with this feature scan for security chips that only ThinkPad-branded batteries contain. Affected ThinkPads flash a message stating &quot;Genuine Lenovo Battery Not Attached&quot; when third-party batteries are used, and the battery will not charge.

==Operating systems==
The ThinkPad has shipped with Microsoft Windows from its inception until the present day. Alongside IBM PC DOS, Windows 3.1x was the default operating system on the original ThinkPad 700.

IBM and Microsoft&#x27;s joint operating system, known as Operating System/2 (OS/2), although not as popular, was also made available as an option from the ThinkPad 700 in 1992, and was officially supported until the T43 in 2005.

The ThinkPad Power series line, sold from 1994 through 1998, was available with AIX and Solaris operating systems.

IBM took its first steps toward ThinkPads with an alternative operating system, when they quietly certified the 390 model for SUSE Linux in November 1998. The company released its first Linux-based unit with the ThinkPad A20m in July 2000. This model, along with the closely-released A21m, T21, and T22 models, came preinstalled with Caldera OpenLinux. IBM shifted away from preinstalled Linux on the ThinkPad after 2002, but continued to support other distributions such as Red Hat Linux, SUSE Linux Enterprise, and Turbolinux using customer installations on A30, A30p, A31p models. This continued through the Lenovo transition with the T60p, until September 2007.

The following year, ThinkPads began shipping with Linux again, when the R61 and T61 were released with SUSE Linux Enterprise as an option. This was short-lived, as Lenovo discontinued that practice in 2009. ThinkPad hardware continued to be certified for Linux.

In 2020, Lenovo shifted into much heavier support of Linux when they announced the ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 8, the P1 Gen 2, and the P53 would come with Fedora Linux as an option. This was the first time that Fedora Linux was made available as a preinstalled option from a major hardware vendor. Following that, Lenovo then began making Ubuntu available as a preinstalled option across nearly thirty different notebook and desktop models, and Fedora Linux on all of its P series lineup.

A small number of ThinkPads, such as the C14, are preinstalled with Google&#x27;s ChromeOS, and are essentially ThinkPad-branded Chromebooks. On these devices, ChromeOS is the only officially supported operating system where installation of Windows and other operating systems requires putting the device into developer mode, as is the case with other Chromebooks.

==Use in space==

ThinkPads have been used heavily in space programs. NASA purchased more than 500 ThinkPad 750 laptops for flight qualification, software development, and crew training, and astronaut John Glenn used ThinkPad laptops on his spaceflight mission STS-95 in 1998.
ThinkPad models used on Shuttle missions include:
* ThinkPad 750 (first used in December 1993 supporting the Hubble repair mission)
* ThinkPad 750C
* ThinkPad 755C
* ThinkPad 760ED
* ThinkPad 760XD (ISS Portable Computing System)
* ThinkPad 770
* ThinkPad A31p (ISS Portable Computing System)
* ThinkPad T61p
* ThinkPad P52 
* ThinkPad T490 
* ThinkPad P15 

The ThinkPad 750 flew aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour during a mission to repair the Hubble Space Telescope on 2 December 1993, running a NASA test program that checked if radiation in the space environment caused memory anomalies or other unexpected problems. ThinkPads were also used in conjunction with a joystick for the Portable In-Flight Landing Operations Trainer (PILOT).

ThinkPads have also been used on space stations. At least three ThinkPad 750C were left in the Spektr module of Mir when it depressurized, and the 755C and 760ED were used as part of the Shuttle–Mir Program, the 760ED without modifications. Additionally, for several decades ThinkPads were the only laptops certified for use on the International Space Station.

ThinkPads used aboard the space shuttle and International Space Station feature safety and operational improvements for the environment they must operate in. Modifications include Velcro tape to attach to surfaces, upgrades to the CPU and video card cooling fans to accommodate for microgravity (in which warmer air does not rise) and lower density of the cabin air, and an adapter for the station&#x27;s 28-volt DC power.

Throughout 2006, a ThinkPad A31p was being used in the Service Module Central Post of the International Space Station and seven ThinkPad A31p laptops were in service in orbit aboard the International Space Station. As of 2010, the Space Station was equipped with ThinkPad A31 computers and 32 ThinkPad T61p laptops. All laptops aboard the ISS are connected to the station&#x27;s LAN via Wi-Fi and are connected to the ground at 3 Mbit/s up and 10 Mbit/s down, comparable to home DSL connection speeds.

Since a new contract with HP in 2016 provided a small number of modified ZBook laptops for ISS use, ThinkPads are no longer the only laptops flown on the ISS but are the predominant laptop present there.

== Popularity ==
The brand has developed a cult following amongst computer enthusiasts since its inception. There are large communities on the Internet dedicated to discussing the line, sharing photos and videos of their own ThinkPads, etc. Older ThinkPad models remain popular among enthusiasts and collectors, who still see them as durable, highly usable machines despite their age and technology. They are also popular with modders due to older ThinkPad models having easy access to their internals, with most part such as the RAM, SSD, and WWAN not being soldered into the computer. Some ThinkPads, such as the X220 and T440p, are notable for being able to run coreboot.

Aftermarket parts have been developed for some models, such as the X60 and X200, for which custom motherboards with more modern processors have been created.

In January 2015, Lenovo celebrated selling its one hundred millionth ThinkPad.

==Reviews and awards==
&quot;Laptop Magazine&quot; in 2006 called the ThinkPad the highest-quality laptop computer keyboard available. It was ranked first in reliability and support in PC Magazine&#x27;s 2007 Survey.

The ThinkPad was the PC Magazine 2006 Reader&#x27;s Choice for PC-based laptops, and ranked number 1 in Support for PC-based laptops. The ThinkPad Series was the first product to receive PC World&#x27;s Hall of Fame award.

The Enderle Group&#x27;s Rob Enderle said that the constant thing about ThinkPad is that the &quot;brand stands for quality&quot; and that &quot;they build the best keyboard in the business.&quot;

The ThinkPad X Tablet series was PC Magazine Editor&#x27;s Choice for tablet PCs. The ThinkPad X60s was ranked number one in ultraportable laptops by PC World. It lasted 8 hours and 21 minutes on a single charge with its 8-cell battery. The Lenovo ThinkPad X60s Series is on PC World&#x27;s Top 100 Products of 2006. The 2005 PC World Reliability and Service survey ranked ThinkPad products ahead of all other brands for reliability.

In the 2004 survey, they were ranked second (behind eMachines). Lenovo was named the most environment-friendly company in the electronics industry by Greenpeace in 2007 but has since dropped to place 14 of 17 as of October 2010.

The IBM/Lenovo ThinkPad T60p received the Editor&#x27;s Choice award for Mobile Graphic Workstation from PC Magazine. Lenovo ThinkPad X60 is the PC Magazine Editor&#x27;s Choice among ultra-portable laptops. The Lenovo ThinkPad T400 series was on PC World&#x27;s Top 100 Products of 2009.

==Current model lines==

===ThinkPad Yoga (2013–current)===
The ThinkPad Yoga is an Ultrabook-class convertible device that functions as both a laptop and tablet computer. The Yoga gets its name from the consumer-oriented IdeaPad Yoga line of computers with the same form factor. The ThinkPad Yoga has a backlit keyboard that flattens when flipped into tablet mode. This was accomplished on 1st generation X1 Yoga with a platform surrounding the keys that rise until level with the keyboard buttons, a locking mechanism that prevents key presses, and feet that pop out to prevent the keyboard from directly resting on flat surfaces. On later X1 Yoga generations, the keys themselves retract in the chassis, so the computer rests on fixed small pads. The touchpad is disabled in this configuration. Lenovo implemented this design in response to complaints about its earlier Yoga 13 and 11 models being awkward to use in tablet mode. A reinforced hinge was required to implement this design. Other than its convertible form factor, the ThinkPad Yoga retains standard ThinkPad features such as a black magnesium-reinforced chassis, an island keyboard, a red TrackPoint, and a large touchpad.

===Tablets===

====ThinkPad Tablet====
Released in August 2011, the ThinkPad Tablet is the first in Lenovo&#x27;s line of business-oriented Tablets with the ThinkPad brand. The tablet has been described by Gadget Mix as a premium business tablet. Since the Tablet is primarily business-oriented, it includes features for security, such as anti-theft software, the ability to remotely disable the tablet, SD card encryption, layered data encryption, and Cisco Virtual Private Network (VPN).

Additionally, the ThinkPad Tablet can run software such as IBM&#x27;s Lotus Notes Traveler. The stylus could be used to write notes on the Tablet, which also included software to convert this handwritten content to text. Another feature on the Tablet was a drag-and-drop utility designed to take advantage of the Tablet&#x27;s touch capabilities. This feature could be used to transfer data between USB devices, internal storage, or an SD card.

Slashgear summarized the ThinkPad Tablet by saying, &quot;The stylus and the styling add up to a distinctive slate that doesn&#x27;t merely attempt to ape Apple&#x27;s iPad.&quot;

====ThinkPad Tablet 2====

To celebrate the 20th anniversary of the ThinkPad, Lenovo held a large party in New York where it announced several products, including the Tablet 2. Lenovo says that the ThinkPad Tablet 2 will be available on 28 October 2012 when Windows 8 is released. The ThinkPad Tablet 2 runs the Windows 8 Pro operating system. It can run any desktop software compatible with this version of Windows.

The Tablet 2 is based on the Clover Trail version of the Intel Atom processor that has been customized for tablets. The Tablet 2 has 2 gigabytes of RAM and a 64GB SSD. The Tablet 2 has a 10.1-inch IPS display with a 16:9 aspect ratio and a resolution of . In a preview, CNET wrote, &quot;Windows 8 looked readable and functional, both in Metro and standard Windows-based interfaces.&quot; A mini-HDMI port is included for video output. An 8-megapixel rear camera and a 2-megapixel front camera are included along with a noise-canceling microphone to facilitate video conferencing.

==== ThinkPad 8 ====
Announced and released in January 2014, the ThinkPad 8 is based on Intel&#x27;s Bay Trail Atom Z3770 processor, with 2 GB of RAM and up to 128 GB of built-in storage. ThinkPad 8 has an 8.3-inch IPS display with a 16:10 aspect ratio and a resolution of pixels. Other features include an aluminum chassis, micro-HDMI port, 8-megapixel back camera (with flash), and optional 4G connectivity. It runs Windows 8.1 as an operating system.

====ThinkPad 10====
Announced in May 2014, Lenovo ThinkPad 10 is a 10&quot; successor to the ThinkPad Tablet 2 and was scheduled to launch in the summer of 2014 along with accessories such as a docking station and external detachable magnetic keyboards. It used Windows 8.1 Pro as its operating system. It was available in 64 and 128GB variants with 1.6GHz quad-core Intel Atom Baytrail processor and 2GB or 4GB of RAM. It optionally supports both 3G and 4G (LTE). Display resolution was announced to be , paired with a stylus pen.

====ThinkPad X1 Tablet====
The ThinkPad X1 Tablet is a fanless tablet powered by Core M CPUs. It is available with 4, 8 or 16GB of LPDDR3 RAM and SATA or a PCIe NVMe SSDs with up to 1TB. It has a IPS screen and supports touch and pen input.

===E series (2011–current)===

The E series is a low-cost ThinkPad line, designed for small business mass-market requirements, and currently contains only a 14&quot; and 16&quot; sub-lines. The E series line of laptops replaced Lenovo&#x27;s Edge series, but somewhere (in some countries) currently offered as both of &quot;ThinkPad Edge/E series&quot; names. The E series also lack metals like magnesium and carbon fibre in their construction which other members of the ThinkPad family enjoy.

===L series (2010–current)===

The L series replaced the former R series, and is positioned as a mid-range ThinkPad offering with mainstream Intel Core i3/i5/i7 CPUs. The L Series have 3 sub-lines, the long-running 14&quot; and 15.6&quot; (and as launched this line had two models, L412 and the L512 in 2010); and as of 2018 there is also a 13&quot; L380 available, which replaces the ThinkPad 13.

===T series (2000–current)===

The T series historically had high-end features, such as magnesium alloy roll-cages, high-density IPS screens known as FlexView (discontinued after the T60 series), 7-row keyboards, screen latches, the UltraBay, and ThinkLight. Models included both 14.1-inch and 15.4-inch displays available in 4:3 and 16:10 aspect ratios.

Since 2012, the entire ThinkPad line was given a complete overhaul, with modifications such as the removal of separate buttons for use with the TrackPoint (xx40 series – 2014, then reintroduced xx50 series – 2015), removal of separate audio control buttons, removal of screen latch, and the removal of LED indicator lights. Models starting from the xx40 series featured a Power Bridge battery system, which had a combination of a lower capacity built-in battery and a higher capacity external battery, enabling the user to switch the external without putting the computer into hibernation. However, beginning with the 2019 xx90 series models, the external battery was removed in favor of a single internal battery. Also, non-widescreen displays are no longer available, with 16:9 aspect ratio as the only remaining choice.

The Tx20 series ThinkPads came in two editions: 15&quot; (T520) or a 14&quot; (T420). These are the last ThinkPads to use the classic 7-row keyboard, with the exception of the Lenovo ThinkPad 25th anniversary edition released on Oct. 5, 2017, which was based on the T470.

Over time, The T series ThinkPad&#x27;s purpose has changed. Initially, the T series ThinkPad was meant to have high-end business features and carry a 10–20% markup over the other ThinkPads. Starting with the T400, the ThinkPad T series became less of a high-end business laptop and became more suited as a mobile workstation, becoming similar to the W series or P series ThinkPads. Achieving similar performance to the W series, but with a 5–10% smaller profile than the W series ThinkPads. In 2013, the T440 introduced another major shift in The ThinkPad T series. The ThinkPad became more of an overall office machine than a mobile workstation. By today&#x27;s standards, The ThinkPad T series is thicker than most of its competitors.
===X series (2000–current)===

The X series is the main high-end ultraportable ThinkPad line, offering a lightweight, highly portable laptop with moderate performance. The current sub-lines for the X series includes:
* 13&quot; X13 (mainstream);
** X13 Yoga (convertible sub-line),
** X1 Nano (small premium sub-line),
* 14&quot; X1 Carbon (premium sub-line), and 
** X1 Yoga (premium convertible sub-line)

The daughter line includes the X1 Tablet (not to be confused with the 2005-2013 X Series tablets).

The mainstream current &quot;workhorse&quot; models is a X13 and X13 Yoga, the 13&quot; successors of the classic discontinued 12&quot; line of Lenovo X Series ThinkPads.

The premium X1 thin-and-light line were the 13.3&quot; ThinkPad models (the X300, X301, and X1) with Ultrabay Thin CD-ROM and removable battery, but are now replaced by the modern premium X1 series ultrabook line, such as the X1 Carbon, X1 Yoga, and X1 Nano sub series.

Discontinued mainstream lines such as the 12&quot; X200(s), X201(s), and X220 models could be ordered with all of the high-end ThinkPad features (like TrackPoint, ThinkLight, a 7-row keyboard, a docking port, hot-swappable HDD, solid magnesium case and optional slice battery). The discontinued 12.5&quot; X220 and X230 still featured a roll cage, a ThinkLight, and an optional premium IPS display (the first IPS display on a non-tablet ThinkPad since the T60p), but the 7-row keyboard was offered only with the X220. However, it lacked the lid latch mechanism which was present on the previous X200 and X201 versions. The discontinued slim 12&quot; line contained only X200s and X201s with low power CPUs and high resolution displays, and X230s with low power CPUs. The 12.5&quot; X series ThinkPads (such as X240 and later) had a more simplified design, and last 12&quot; X280 model had only the Trackpoint feature, partially magnesium case and simplified docking port.

The obsolete low-cost 11.6&quot; (netbook line) X100e and X120e were are all plastic, lacking both the latch and the ThinkLight, and using a variant of the island keyboard (known as chiclet keyboard) found on the Edge series. The X100e was also offered in red in addition to blue, and white in some countries. Those were more like high-end netbooks, whereas the X200 series were more like full ultraportables, featuring Intel Core (previously Core 2 and Celeron) series CPUs rather than AMD netbook CPUs.

The X Series with &quot;tablet&quot; suffixes is an outdated variant of the 12&quot; X Series models, with low voltage CPUs and a flip-screen tablet resistive touchscreen. These include the traditional ThinkPad features, and have been noted for using a higher quality AFFS-type screen with better viewing angles compared to the screens used on other ThinkPads.

===P series (2015–current)===

The P Series line of laptops replaced the W series and reintroduced 17.3&quot; screens to the ThinkPad line. The P Series (excluding models with &#x27;s&#x27; suffix) is designed for engineers, architects, animators, etc. and comes with a variety of &quot;high-end&quot; options. All P series models come included with fingerprint readers. The P series includes features such as dedicated magnesium roll cages, more indicator LED lights, and high-resolution displays.

=== Z series (2022-present) ===
The Z series currently consists of two models: the 13-inch model, Z13, and the 16-inch model, Z16. It was introduced in January 2022 . The series is marketed towards business customers, as well as a generally younger audience. &quot;The Verge&quot; wrote: &quot;Lenovo is trying to make ThinkPads cool to the kids. The company has launched the ThinkPad Z series, a thin and light ThinkPad line with funky colors, eco-friendly packaging, and a distinctly modern look.&quot; The series features a new metal sleek, contemporary, thin design, which differs greatly from other recent, more traditional-looking ThinkPad models. The Z13 model was introduced in three new colors—black, silver, and black vegan leather with bronze accents—while the Z16 is only available in one of them, silver. The laptops are equipped with AMD Ryzen PRO processors. Other notable features include 1080p webcams, OLED displays, new, redesigned touchpads, spill resistant keyboards, Dolby Atmos speaker systems, and Windows 11 with Windows Hello support.

==Historical models==

=== ThinkPad 130 ===
IBM&#x27;s ThinkPad 130 was a low-cost laptop computer released in 1996, part of the ThinkPad 300 series. It was designed for everyday use and was lightweight and portable. The laptop was built to withstand rigours and included a built-in modem for dial-up internet access. The ThinkPad 130 was a significant product for IBM, expanding the market for affordable laptops and being one of the first to feature a built-in modem for internet connectivity.

===ThinkPad 235===
The Japan-only ThinkPad 235 (or Type 2607) was the progeny of the IBM/Ricoh RIOS project. Also known as Clavius or Chandra2, it contains unusual features like the presence of three PCMCIA slots and the use of dual camcorder batteries as a source of power. Features an Intel Pentium MMX 233 MHz CPU, support for up to 160 MB of EDO memory, and a built-in hard drive with UDMA support. Hitachi marketed Chandra2 as the Prius Note 210.

===ThinkPad 240===
The ultraportable ThinkPad 240 (X, Z) started with an Intel Celeron processor and went up to the 600 MHz Intel Pentium III. In models using the Intel 440BX chipset, the RAM was expandable to 320 MB max with a BIOS update. Models had a screen and an key pitch (a standard key pitch is ). They were also one of the first ThinkPad series to contain a built-in Mini PCI card slot (form factor 3b). The 240s have no optical disc drives and an external floppy drive. An optional extended battery sticks out the bottom like a bar and props up the back of the laptop. Weighing in at , these were the smallest and lightest ThinkPads ever made.
===300 series===
The 300 series (300, 310, 340, 345, 350, 360, 365, 370, 380, 385, 390 ) was a long-running value series starting at the 386SL/25 processor, all the way to the Pentium III 450. The 300 series was offered as a slightly lower-price alternative from the 700 series, with a few exceptions.

The ThinkPad 360P and 360PE was a low-end version of ThinkPad 750P, and was unique model in the 300 series in that it could be used as a regular laptop, or transform into a tablet by flipping the monitor on top of itself. Retailing for $3,699 in 1995, the 360PE featured a touch sensitive monitor that operated with the stylus; the machine could run operating systems that supported the touch screen such as PenDOS 2.2.

The 300 series was succeeded by the A##m series.

===500 series===
The 500 series were the main line of the ultraportable ThinkPads. Starting with the 486SLC2-50 to the Pentium III 500, these machines had only a hard disk on board. Any other drives were external (or in the 570&#x27;s case in the UltraBase). They weighed in at around .

The 500 series was succeeded by the X## series.

===600 series===
The 600 series are thinner variants of the 770 series. The 600 series packed a SVGA or a XGA TFT LCD, Pentium MMX, Pentium II or III processor, full-sized keyboard, and optical bay into a package weighing roughly . IBM was able to create this light, fully featured machine by using lightweight but strong carbon fiber composite plastics. The battery shipped with some 600 series models had a manufacturing defect that left it vulnerable to memory effect and resulted in poor battery life, but this problem can be avoided by use of a third-party battery.

The 700 series was succeeded by the T## series.

===700 series===

The 700 series was a high-end ThinkPad line; The released models can be configured with the best screens, largest hard drives and fastest processors available in the ThinkPad range; some features can be found only on a 700 series models, and was the first successful ThinkPad introduced in 1992 (that was a tablet PC 700T model without a keyboard and a mouse).

The 700 series was succeeded by the T## and A##p series.

===800 series===
The ThinkPad 800 series were unique as they were based on the PowerPC architecture rather than the Intel x86 architecture. Most of the 800 Series laptops used the PowerPC 603e CPU, at speeds of 100 MHz, or 166 MHz in the 860 model. The PowerPC ThinkPad line was considerably more expensive than the standard x86 ThinkPads — even a modestly configured 850 cost upwards of $12,000. All of the PowerPC ThinkPads could run Windows NT 3.51 and 4.0, AIX 4.1.x, and Solaris Desktop 2.5.1 PowerPC Edition.

===WorkPad===
Based on ThinkPad design although branded WorkPad, the IBM WorkPad z50 was a Handheld PC running Windows CE, released in 1999. The WorkPad brand of products, outside of the z50 model, was a line of personal digital assistants(PDAs).

===i series (1998–2002)===

The ThinkPad i Series was introduced by IBM in 1998 and was geared towards a multimedia focus with many models featuring independent integrated CD players and multimedia access buttons. The 1400 and 1500 models were designed by Acer for IBM under contract (and are thus nicknamed the AcerPad) and featured similar hardware found in Acer laptops (including ALi chipsets, three way audio jacks and the internal plastics painted with a copper paint). Some of the i Series ThinkPads, particularly the Acer developed models, are prone to broken hinges and stress damage on the chassis.

One notable ThinkPad in the i Series lineup are the S3x (S30/S31) models: featuring a unique keyboard and lid design allowing a standard size keyboard to fit in a chassis that otherwise wouldn&#x27;t be able to support the protruding keyboard. These models were largely only available in Asia Pacific. IBM offered an optional piano black lid on these models (designed by the Yamato Design lab). This is the only ThinkPad since the 701C to feature a special design to accommodate a keyboard that&#x27;s physically larger than the laptop and also the only ThinkPad (aside from the Z61) to deviate away from the standard matte lid.

===A series (2000–2004)===

The A series was developed as an all-around productivity machine, equipped with hardware powerful enough to make it a desktop replacement. Hence it was the biggest and heaviest ThinkPad series of its time, but also had features not even found in a T series of the same age. The A series was dropped in favor of the R and G series.

The A31 was released in 2002 as a desktop replacement system equipped with: A Pentium 4-M processor clocked at 1.6, 1.8, 1.9, or 2.0 GHz (max supported is a 2.6 GHz), An ATI Mobility Radeon 7500, 128 or 256 MB of PC2100 RAM (officially upgradable to 1 GB but can be unofficially upgraded to 2 GB), IBM High Rate Wireless (PRISM 2.5 Based, can be modified to support WPA-TKIP) and equipped with a 20, 30, or 40 GB hard disk drive.

===R series (2001–2010, 2018-present?) ===

The R series was a budget line, beginning with the R30 in 2001 and ending with the R400 and R500 presented in 2008.

The successors also from 2006 of the R400 and R500 models are the L series models L412 and L512.

A notable model is the R50p with an optional 15&quot; IPS LCD screen (introduced in 2003).

The R series reintroduced in 2018 (for Chinese market only) with the same hardware as E series models, but with aluminum display cover, discrete GPU, TPM chip and fingerprint reader.

===G series (2003–2006) ===
The G series consisted of only three models, the G40, G41 and G50 (which was only sold in Japan). Being large and heavy machines, equipped with powerful desktop processors, this line of ThinkPads consequently served mainly as budget replacements for desktop computers. 

The G series was able to be configured with either an entry-level Celeron or a 3 GHz Pentium 4 processor. The G series line of ThinkPads often received criticism for its heft, weighing in at 8.4lbs (3.81kg). 

===Z series (2005–2007) ===
The Z series was released as a high-end multimedia laptop; as a result this was the first ThinkPad to feature a widescreen (16:10 aspect ratio) display. The Z series was also unique in that certain models featured an (optional) titanium lid. Integrated WWAN and a webcam were also found on some configurations. The series has only ever included the Z60 (Z60m and Z60t) and Z61 (Z61m, Z61t and Z61p); the latter of which is the first Z series ThinkPad with Intel &quot;Yonah&quot; Dual-Core Technology. The processor supports Intel VT-x; this is disabled in the BIOS but can be turned on with a BIOS update. Running fully virtualised operating systems via Xen or VMware is therefore possible. Despite the Z61 carrying the same number as the T61, the hardware of the Z61 is closer to a T60 (and likewise the Z60 being closer to a T43).

===ThinkPad Reserve Edition (2007)===
The &quot;15-year anniversary&quot; ThinkPad model (based on a X60s laptop). This model was initially known inside of Lenovo as the &quot;Scout&quot;. This was the name of the horse ridden by Tonto, the sidekick from the 1950s television series &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot;. Lenovo envisioned the Scout as a very high-end ThinkPad that would be analogous to a luxury car. Each unit was covered in fine leather embossed with its owners initials. Extensive market research was conducted on how consumers would perceive this form factor. It was determined that they appreciated that it emphasised warmth, nature, and human relations over technology. The Scout was soon renamed the ThinkPad Reserve Edition. It came bundled with premium services including a dedicated 24-hour technical support hotline that would be answered immediately. It was released in 2007 and sold for $5,000 in the United States.

===SL series (2008–2010) ===

The SL series was launched in 2008 as a low-end ThinkPad targeted mainly geared toward small businesses. These lacked several traditional ThinkPad features, such as the ThinkLight, magnesium alloy roll cage, UltraBay, and lid latch, and use a 6-row keyboard with a different layout than the traditional 7-row ThinkPad keyboard; also, SL series models have IdeaPad-based firmware. Models offered included 13.3&quot; (SL300), 14&quot; (SL400 and SL410) and 15.6&quot; (SL500 and SL510).

===W series (2008–2015) ===

The W series laptops were introduced by Lenovo as workstation-class laptops with their own letter designation, a descendant of prior ThinkPad T series models suffixed with &#x27;p&#x27; (e.g. T61p), and are geared towards CAD users, photographers, power users, and others, who need a high-performance system for demanding tasks. The W series laptops were launched in 2008, at the same time as the Intel Centrino 2, marking an overhaul of Lenovo&#x27;s product lineup. The first two W series laptops introduced were the W500 and the W700.

Previously available were the W7xx series (17&quot; widescreen model), the W500 (15.4&quot; 16:10 ratio model), the W510 (15.6&quot; 16:9 ratio model), and W520 (15.6&quot; 16:9 ratio model). The W700ds and the W701ds both had two displays: a 17&quot; main LCD and a 10&quot; slide-out secondary LCD. The W7xx series were also available with a Wacom digitizer built into the palm rest. These high-performance workstation models offered more high-end components, such as quad core CPUs and higher-end workstation graphics compared to the T series, and were the most powerful ThinkPad laptops available. Until the W540, they retained the ThinkLight, UltraBay, roll cage, and lid latch found on the T series. The W540 release marked the end of the lid latch, ThinkLight, and hot-swappable UltraBays found in earlier models.

The ThinkPad W series laptops from Lenovo are described by the manufacturer as being &quot;mobile workstations&quot;, and suit that description by being physically on the larger side of the laptop spectrum, with screens ranging from 15&quot; to 17&quot; in size. Most W series laptops offer high-end quad-core Intel processors with an integrated GPU as well as an Nvidia Quadro discrete GPU, utilizing Nvidia Optimus to switch between the two GPUs as required. Notable exceptions are the W500, which has ATI FireGL integrated workstation-class graphics, and the W550s, which is an Ultrabook-specification laptop with only a dual-core processor. The W series laptops offer independent software vendor certifications from various vendors such as Adobe Systems and Autodesk for CAD and 3D modeling software.

The ThinkPad W series has been discontinued and replaced by the P series mobile workstations.

===Edge series (2010)===
The Edge series was released early in 2010 as small business and consumer-end machines. The design was a radical departure compared to the traditional black boxy ThinkPad design, with glossy surfaces (optional matte finish on later models), rounded corners, and silver trim. They were also offered in red, a first for the traditionally black ThinkPads. Like the SL, this series was targeted towards small businesses and consumers, and lack the roll cage, UltraBay, lid latch, and ThinkLight of traditional ThinkPads (though the 2011 E220s and E420s had ThinkLights). This also introduced an island-style keyboard with a significantly different layout.

Models included 13.3&quot; (Edge 13), 14&quot; (Edge 14), and 15.6&quot; (Edge 15) sizes. An 11.6&quot; (Edge 11) model was offered, but not available in the United States. The latest models of E series can be offered with Edge branding, but this naming is optional and uncommon.

===S series (2012–2014) ===
The S Series is positioned as a mid-range ThinkPad offering, containing ultrabooks derived from the Edge Series. As of August 2013, the S Series includes S531 and S440 models; their cases are made of aluminum and magnesium alloy, available in silver and gunmetal colors.

==== ThinkPad Twist (2012) ====
The ThinkPad Twist (Edge S230u) is a laptop/tablet computer hybrid aimed at high-end users. The Twist gets its name from its screen&#x27;s ability to twist in a manner that converts the device into a tablet. The Twist has a 12.5&quot; screen and makes use of Intel&#x27;s Core i7 processor and SSD technology in lieu of a hard drive.

In a review for &quot;Engadget&quot; Dana Wollman wrote, &quot;Lately, we feel like all of our reviews of Windows 8 convertibles end the same way. The ThinkPad Twist has plenty going for it: a bright IPS display, a good port selection, an affordable price and an unrivaled typing experience. Like ThinkPads past, it also offers some useful software features for businesses lacking dedicated IT departments. All good things, but what&#x27;s a road warrior to do when the battery barely lasts four hours? Something tells us the Twist will still appeal to Lenovo loyalists, folks who trust ThinkPad&#x27;s build quality and wouldn&#x27;t be caught dead using any other keyboard. If you&#x27;re more brand-agnostic, though, there are other Windows 8 convertibles with comfortable keyboards – not to mention, sharper screens, faster performance and longer battery life.&quot;

===ThinkPad Helix (2013–2015)===

The Helix is a convertible laptop satisfying both tablet and conventional notebook users. It uses a &quot;rip and flip&quot; design that allows the user to detach the display and then replace it facing in a different direction. It sports an 11.6&quot; Full HD (1920 × 1080) display, with support for Windows 8 multi-touch. As all essential processing hardware is contained in the display assembly and it has multitouch capability, the detached monitor can be used as a standalone tablet computer. The Helix&#x27;s high-end hardware and build quality, including Gorilla Glass, stylus-based input, and Intel vPro hardware-based security features, are designed to appeal to business users.

In a review published in &quot;Forbes&quot; Jason Evangelho wrote, &quot;The first laptop I owned was a ThinkPad T20, and the next one may very likely be the ThinkPad Helix which Lenovo unveiled at CES 2013. In a sea of touch-inspired Windows 8 hardware, it&#x27;s the first ultrabook convertible with a form factor that gets everything right. The first batch of Windows 8 ultrabooks get high marks for their inspired designs, but aren&#x27;t quite flexible enough to truly be BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) solutions. Lenovo&#x27;s own IdeaPad Yoga came close, but the sensation of feeling the keyboard underneath your fingers when transformed into tablet mode was slightly jarring. Dell&#x27;s XPS 12 solved that problem with its clever rotating hinge design, but I wanted the ability to remove the tablet display entirely from both of those products.&quot;

===ThinkPad 11e (2014–2021)===
The ThinkPad 11e was a low-cost laptop computer for schools and students with an 11-inch screen and without trackpoint. 11e Yoga is a convertible version of 11e.

===ThinkPad 13 (2016–2018)===
The ThinkPad 13 (also known as the Thinkpad S2 in mainland China) is a &quot;budget&quot; model with a 13-inch screen. Versions running Windows 10 and Google&#x27;s ChromeOS were options. The most powerful configuration had a 6th generation Core i7 processor and a 512GB SSD. Connectivity includes HDMI, USB 3.0, OneLink+, USB Type-C, etc. It weighs and is thick. In 2017, a second generation Ultrabook model has been released with up to a 7th generation Core i7 processor and a FHD touchscreen available in certain countries. This lineup was merged into the L series in 2018, with the L380 being the successor to the 13 Gen 2.

===25th anniversary Retro ThinkPad (2017)===

Lenovo released the 25th anniversary Retro ThinkPad 25 in October 2017. The model is based on the T470, the difference being it having the 7-Row &quot;Classic&quot; keyboard with the layout found on the −20 Series, and the logo received a splash of colour reminiscent of the IBM era. The last ThinkPad models with the 7-row keyboard were introduced in 2011.

=== A series (2017–2018) ===
In September 2017, Lenovo announced two ThinkPad models featuring AMD&#x27;s PRO chipset technology – the A275 and A475. This sees the revival of the A Series nameplate not seen since the early 2000s when ThinkPads were under IBM&#x27;s ownership, however it is likely the &quot;A&quot; moniker emphasised that it uses AMD technology rather than comparative product segment (workstation class) of the previous line.

While this isn&#x27;t the first time Lenovo had offered an AMD derived ThinkPad, it is the first to be released as an alternative premium offering to the established T series and X series ThinkPads, which use Intel processors instead.

;A275 and A475:The A275 is a 12.5&quot; ultraportable based on the Intel derived X270 model. Weighing in at 2.9 pounds (1.31 kg) this model features AMD Carrizo or Bristol Ridge APU&#x27;s, AMD Radeon R7 graphics and AMD DASH (Desktop and mobile Architecture for System Hardware) for enterprise computing.

:The A475 is a 14&quot; mainstream portable computer based on the Intel derived T470 model. Weighing at 3.48 pounds (1.57 kg), like the A275 it features AMD Carrizo or Bristol Ridge APU&#x27;s, AMD Radeon R7 graphics and AMD DASH (Desktop and mobile Architecture for System Hardware) for enterprise computing.

;A285 and A485:The A285 is a 12.5&quot; laptop which is an upgraded version of the A275. Weighing in at , this model utilizes an AMD Raven Ridge APU with integrated Vega graphics, specifically a Ryzen 5 PRO 2500U or Ryzen 7 PRO 2700. The laptop also contains a discrete Trusted Platform Module (dTPM) for data encryption and password protection, supporting TPM 2.0. Optional security features include a fingerprint scanner and smart card reader. The display&#x27;s native resolution can be either or depending on the configuration.

:The A485 is a 14&quot; laptop which is an upgraded version of the A475. Weighing , this model utilizes AMD&#x27;s Raven Ridge APU&#x27;s with integrated Vega graphics. This model can use multiple models of Raven Ridge APU&#x27;s, unlike the A285. The laptop also contains a Discrete Trusted Platform Module (dTPM) for data encryption and password protection, supporting TPM 2.0. Optional security features include a fingerprint scanner and smart card reader. The display&#x27;s native resolution can be either or depending on the configuration.

==Accessories==

Lenovo also makes a range of accessories meant to complement and enhance the experience of using a ThinkPad device. These include:

=== ThinkPad Stack (2015–current) ===

The ThinkPad Stack line of products includes accessories designed for portability and interoperability. This line includes external hard drives, a wireless router, a power bank, and a Bluetooth 4.0 speaker. Each Stack device includes rubber feet, magnets, and pogo-pin power connections that allow the use of a single cable. The combined weight of all the Stack devices is slightly less than two pounds. The Stack series was announced in January 2015 at the International CES. The Stack series of accessories was expanded at the 2016 International CES to include a 720p resolution projector with 150 lumens of brightness and a wireless charging station (However, the wireless charger was never released).

The Stack has a &quot;blocky, black, and rectangular&quot; look with the ThinkPad logo. It shares a common design language with ThinkPad laptop computers.

=== Docking stations (1993–current) ===

The ThinkPad laptop line has a history of using docking stations to enhance functionality and connectivity. These stations provide additional ports, peripherals, and larger displays, transforming the laptop into a desktop-like setup. There are three types of ThinkPad docking stations: Port Replicators, which replicate the ports found on the laptop, Advanced Docking Stations, which offer more extensive functionality, built-in speakers, microphones, and card readers, and Desktop Docking Stations, which transform the ThinkPad into a desktop setup with a larger monitor, keyboard, and mouse.

Current docking stations (or docks) add much of the functional abilities of a desktop computer, including multiple display outputs, additional USB ports, and occasionally other features. This allows the ThinkPads to be connected and disconnected from various peripherals quickly and easily.

Old docks connected via a proprietary connector located on the underside of the laptops. Current docks connect via Thunderbolt or USB-C.

=== UltraBay (1995–2014) ===
The internal replaceable (hot-swappable) CD-drive bay that supports a list of optional components, such as a CD-/DVD/Blu-ray drives, hard drive caddies, additional batteries, or device cradles.

=== Slice batteries (2000–2012) ===
Some classic models (IBM and early Lenovo T and X series) can support an additional slice battery which mounts to the underside of the machine instead of the UltraBay additional battery.

=== UltraPort (2000–2002) ===

===ThinkPad USB 3.0 Secure Hard Drive===
An external USB 3.0/2.0 hard drive that was designed by Lenovo in 2009. It requires the input of a 4 digit PIN to access data and this can be set by the user. These drives are manufactured for Lenovo by Apricorn, Inc.

===ThinkPad keyboards (external)===

IBM/Lenovo made several USB/Bluetooth keyboards with integrated UltraNav&#x27;s and TrackPoints. Notable models include

# SK-8845
# SK-8835
# SK-8855
# ThinkPad Compact USB Keyboard (current model)
# ThinkPad Compact Bluetooth Keyboard (current model)
# ThinkPad TrackPoint Keyboard II (current model)

===ThinkPad Mouses===
ThinkPad Mouses come in several different varieties ranging from Bluetooth ones through wired ones, to even ones with a trackpoint built-in and labelled as a scroll point.

===ThinkPad stands===
The ThinkPad Stands were a series of laptop stands designed for ThinkPad laptops, primarily sold in Asian markets. They offered various features to enhance user experience and ergonomics. Key features included adjustable height settings, cooling features, ergonomic design, and portability. These stands allowed users to find the most comfortable viewing angle, dissipate heat from the laptop, promote a healthy posture, and provide a convenient solution for improving laptop usage. They were particularly popular among ThinkPad users in Asian markets, particularly those who spent long hours working on their laptops. The ThinkPad Stands were a significant addition to the laptop market.

===ThinkPlus charger===
The ThinkPlus charger is a power adapter designed for Lenovo ThinkPad laptops, providing the necessary power to charge the battery and operate the device. Its key features include compatibility with specific ThinkPad models, varying power output (typically measured in watts), and the ability to operate with different input voltages. Built-in safety features protect the charger and laptop from overheating, overvoltage, and short circuits. ThinkPlus chargers are compact and lightweight, making them easy to carry around. There are three types of ThinkPlus chargers: AC Adapters, designed for wall outlets, car chargers for vehicles, and travel chargers, making them ideal for travel.

<doc id="238788" wikidata="Q307882" url="?curid=238788" title="Judy Davis">
<text>Judith Davis (born 23 April 1955) is an Australian actress. In a career spanning over four decades of both screen and stage, she has been commended for her versatility and regarded as one of the finest actresses of her generation. Frequent collaborator Woody Allen described her as &quot;one of the most exciting actresses in the world&quot;. Davis has received numerous accolades, including nine AACTA Awards (of which she is the most rewarded recipient), three Primetime Emmy Awards, two British Academy Film Awards, and two Golden Globe Awards, in addition to nominations for two Academy Awards.

After graduating from the National Institute of Dramatic Art, she began her career on the stage and had her film debut in 1977. She rose to international attention with her leading role in the period drama film &quot;My Brilliant Career&quot; (1979), winning two BAFTA Awards. This led to starring roles in Hollywood projects, receiving her first Emmy nomination for the docudrama &quot;A Woman Called Golda&quot; (1982). She received nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actress for starring in the historical film &quot;A Passage to India&quot; (1984) and Best Supporting Actress for Allen&#x27;s comedy-drama &quot;Husbands and Wives&quot; (1992). 

Davis won three Primetime Emmy Awards for starring in the television film &quot;Serving in Silence: The Margarethe Cammermeyer Story&quot; (1995), and the miniseries &quot;Life with Judy Garland: Me and My Shadows&quot; (2001) and &quot;The Starter Wife&quot; (2007). Her subsequent films include &quot;Children of the Revolution&quot; (1996), &quot;Celebrity&quot; (1998), &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; (2006), &quot;The Eye of the Storm&quot; (2011), &quot;To Rome with Love&quot; (2012), &quot;The Dressmaker&quot; (2015), and &quot;Nitram&quot; (2021).

==Early life==
Davis was born in Perth, Western Australia, in the suburb of Floreat Park and had a strict Catholic upbringing. She was educated at Loreto Convent and the Western Australian Institute of Technology and graduated from the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA), Sydney, Australia in 1977.

==Career==
===Screen===
====1970s====
After making her feature film debut in the buddy comedy &quot;High Rolling&quot; (1977), Davis first came to prominence for her role as Sybylla Melvyn in the coming-of-age saga &quot;My Brilliant Career&quot; (1979), for which she won BAFTA Awards for Best Actress and Best Newcomer. Davis was particularly praised for her performance; Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; admired her for bringing &quot;an unconventional vigor to every scene she&#x27;s in, even in a film that&#x27;s as consistently animated as this one&quot;, while Luke Buckmaster, writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2014, commented that Davis gave &quot;a rousing performance as bull-headed protagonist Sybylla Melvyn. The term &quot;once in a lifetime&quot; tends to be slapped around like a bumper sticker, but this meaty role lives up to the accolade.&quot; 

====1980s====
Her success continued with lead roles in the Australian New Wave films &quot;Winter of Our Dreams&quot; (1981), as a waif-like heroin addict; the drama &quot;Heatwave&quot; (1982), as a radical Sydney tenant organizer; and the thriller &quot;Hoodwink&quot; (1981), as a sexually-repressed clergyman&#x27;s wife. Of her performance in &quot;Winter of Our Dreams&quot;, Roger Ebert wrote that: &quot;Davis brought a kind of wiry, feisty intelligence to &quot;My Brilliant Career&quot;, playing an Australian farm woman who rather felt she would do things her own way. She&#x27;s wonderful again this time, in a completely different role as an insecure, distrustful, skinny street waif. [She] performs her movement magnificently.
Her international film career began when she played the younger version of Ingrid Bergman&#x27;s Golda Meir in the television docudrama &quot;A Woman Called Golda&quot; (1981), for which she received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress – Miniseries or a Movie nomination. She then played a terrorist in the British film &quot;Who Dares Wins&quot; (1982).

She was cast as Adela Quested in David Lean&#x27;s final film &quot;A Passage to India&quot; (1984), an adaptation of E. M. Forster&#x27;s novel, and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress. &quot;Variety&quot; praised Davis for having &quot;the rare gift of being able to look very plain (as the role calls for) at one moment and uncommonly beautiful at another. Likewise, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;With makeup the color of smudged ivory, her pallor enhanced by the off-white linens she wears, Davis is daringly unattractive for a leading lady; that plainness is emphasized in the book. Davis&#x27; neuroticism, her way of twitching and thrusting her jaw and looking up hungrily beneath the brim of her straw hat, brings to life the ravenous sexuality beneath Miss Quested&#x27;s decorous exterior.&quot;

She returned to Australian cinema for her next two films, &quot;Kangaroo&quot; (1987), as a German-born writer&#x27;s wife, and &quot;High Tide&quot; (also 1987), as a foot-loose mother attempting to reunite with her teenage daughter who is being raised by the paternal grandmother. Her performance in the latter won her glowing praise. Pauline Kael called Davis &quot;a genius at moods&quot; and wrote, &quot;As one of three backup singers for a touring Elvis imitator, Judy Davis is contemptuous of the cruddy act, contemptuous of herself. The film&#x27;s emotional suggestiveness makes it almost a primal woman&#x27;s picture: Judy Davis has been compared with Jeanne Moreau, and that&#x27;s apt, but she&#x27;s Moreau without the cultural swank, the high-fashion gloss. She speaks to us more directly.&quot; She won additional Australian Film Institute Awards for both roles, and a National Society of Film Critics award for &quot;High Tide&quot;″s brief American theatrical run.

Her final film of the decade, the Australian thriller &quot;Georgia&quot; (1988), saw her play dual roles, a mother, Georgia, and her daughter Nina. For her performance, Davis earned another Australian Film Institute nomination for Best Actress.

====1990s====
Davis had a cameo in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Alice&quot; (1990), her first appearance in an Allen-directed film. The following year, she was featured in Joel Coen&#x27;s &quot;Barton Fink&quot;, which won the &quot;Palme d&#x27;Or&quot; at the Cannes Film Festival, and in David Cronenberg&#x27;s &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;, an adaptation of the hallucinogenic novel of the same name. 

She returned to E. M. Forster territory in &quot;Where Angels Fear to Tread&quot; and won an Independent Spirit Award for her work as mannish woman author George Sand in &quot;Impromptu&quot;, a romantic period drama with Hugh Grant as her consumptive lover, Frédéric Chopin. Davis was especially lauded for her performance as Sand, and Hal Hinson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;Judy Davis makes her entrances as if she were straddling a cyclone. She doesn&#x27;t just walk in, she blows in on a torrent of extravagant self-assurance and wild temperament. Sand, who&#x27;s the locus of this blissfully high-spirited romp about the circle of writers and musicians in 1830s Paris, never does anything halfway; her life is an experiment in full-throttle, passionate immersion, and that&#x27;s why Davis is the ideal actress for the part. She&#x27;s the most atmospheric of actors, perhaps the only one around capable of streaking the screen with lightning.&quot; 

She earned an Emmy nomination and her first Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film for her portrayal of a real-life Second World War heroine Mary Lindell in the CBS Hallmark Hall of Fame presentation &quot;One Against the Wind.&quot; Adrian Turner of &quot;Radio Times&quot; noted of her, &quot;Judy Davis, one of the greatest and least &quot;starry&quot; actresses around, plays Lindell and shows the same sensitivity that she brought to her role in &quot;A Passage to India.&quot;&quot;

Cast in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Husbands and Wives&quot; (1992), Davis performed the major role of Sally Simmons, one half of a divorcing couple. &quot;Husbands and Wives&quot; was well received, and Davis&#x27;s performance drew high praise. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Sally must be one of the most endearingly impossible characters Mr. Allen has ever written, and Ms. Davis nearly purloins the film&quot; and Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; thought Davis had revealed &quot;a whole new side to her personality that has never surfaced onscreen before.&quot; For this performance, she earned both Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for Best Supporting Actress.

She next co-starred with Kevin Spacey in the comedy film &quot;The Ref&quot; (1994), portraying a married couple whose relationship is on the rocks, with Denis Leary playing a thief who counsels their marriage. Roger Ebert called Davis &quot;naturally verbal&quot; and praised her for being able to &quot;develop a manic counterpoint&quot; in her arguments with Spacey &quot;that elevates them to a sort of art form.&quot; Similarly, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s Peter Travers found Davis &quot;combustibly funny, finding nuance even in nonsense.&quot; Considered &quot;one of the fiercest film actors around&quot;, Davis&#x27;s other roles have included the mysterious, schizophrenic mother of a teenager in boarding school in &quot;On My Own&quot; (1993), the lifelong Australian Communist Party member reacting to the downfall of the Soviet Union in &quot;Children of the Revolution&quot; (1996), two more Allen films, &quot;Deconstructing Harry&quot; (1997) and &quot;Celebrity&quot; (1998) and a highly-strung White House chief of staff in &quot;Absolute Power&quot; (1997). After appearing in &quot;Celebrity&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper wrote that Davis &quot;in recent years has succeeded Diane Keaton and Mia Farrow as Allen&#x27;s misfit muse.&quot;

Much of her work in the late 90s was for television, gaining a collection of Emmy Award nominations. She won her first Emmy for portraying the woman who gently coaxes a rigid military woman, Glenn Close, out of the closet in &quot;Serving in Silence: The Margarethe Cammermeyer Story&quot;, with subsequent nominations for her repressed Australian outback mother in &quot;The Echo of Thunder&quot; (1998), her portrayal of Lillian Hellman in &quot;Dash and Lilly&quot; (1999) and her frigid society matron in &quot;A Cooler Climate&quot; (1999).

====2000s====
Davis earned a second Emmy for her portrayal of Judy Garland in the television biographical film &quot;Life with Judy Garland: Me and My Shadows&quot; (2001). In 2003, she earned another Emmy nomination for her interpretation of Nancy Reagan in the controversial biopic &quot;The Reagans&quot;. In 2004 she co-starred with Richard Dreyfus in &quot;Coast to Coast&quot;. In July 2006, she received her ninth Emmy nomination for her performance in the television film &quot;A Little Thing Called Murder&quot;. Her tenth nomination came in 2007 for Outstanding Supporting Actress in the U.S. miniseries &quot;The Starter Wife&quot; for which she was awarded the Emmy. In August 2007, she appeared opposite Sam Waterston in an episode of ABC&#x27;s anthology series &quot;Masters of Science Fiction&quot;. She appeared on the TV mini-series &quot;Diamonds&quot; from 2008 to 2009.

In film, she continued to earn good notices for her supporting roles in &quot;Swimming Upstream&quot; (2003), as a working-class mother, and in the films &quot;The Break-Up&quot; (2006) and &quot;Marie-Antoinette&quot;.

====2010s====
Davis appeared as Jill Tankard in a television drama film, &quot;Page Eight&quot; (2011), for which she was nominated for an Emmy. She played Dorothy de Lascabanes in &quot;The Eye of the Storm&quot; (2011), an adaptation of Patrick White&#x27;s novel of the same title, for which she won the Australian Film Institute Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role. She also had a major role as Woody Allen&#x27;s psychiatrist wife in his &quot;To Rome with Love&quot;.

Davis co-starred with Helena Bonham Carter and Callum Keith Rennie in &quot;The Young and Prodigious T.S. Spivet&quot; (2013). She reprised her role of Jill Tankard in &quot;Salting the Battlefield&quot; (2014) and costarred with Kate Winslet in &quot;The Dressmaker&quot; (2015), for which she won an AACTA Award for Best Supporting Actress. Although the film received mixed reviews, Davis&#x27;s supporting performance was lauded by critics: Richard Ouzounian of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; called her &quot;sublime&quot; and Justin Chang of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;Davis, whose performance here as a booze-swilling, dementia-addled and infernally sharp-tongued old matriarch is enough of a hoot to make one further wonder what she might have done with the role of Violet Weston in &quot;&quot;, onscreen or onstage.&quot;

In 2017, Davis received a Primetime Emmy nomination for her supporting performance as gossip columnist Hedda Hopper in Ryan Murphy&#x27;s anthology television series &quot;Feud&quot;. The following year, Davis co-starred with Aaron Pederson in the six-part ABC TV Series, &quot;Mystery Road&quot;. Davis&#x27;s performance as the local police sergeant was praised, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;The thing that really sets &quot;Mystery Road&quot; apart is the actress who signed on to play the outback sergeant Emma James: the great Judy Davis, playing a police officer for the first time in her career and starring in an Australian TV series for the first time in nearly 40 years. Ms. Davis is so firmly identified in the American mind with intense, often neurotic city-dwelling characters that it takes an episode or two to get used to her climbing in and out of a police car in the dusty, empty landscapes, wearing a baggy blue uniform that swallows her tiny frame. It seems at first as if she might not be right for the part, but eventually you see that she&#x27;s perfect. James is a formidable woman stuck in the middle of nowhere because of the bonds of family and history, and Ms. Davis&#x27;s preternatural intelligence and tightly capped energy serve her well.&quot;

====2020s====
In 2020 she reunited with Ryan Murphy portraying Betsy Bucket in the drama series &quot;Ratched&quot;. Also that year she acted in the Apple TV+ series &quot;Roar&quot;. The following year she acted opposite Caleb Landry Jones in the psychological drama film &quot;Nitram&quot; (2021) directed by Justin Kurzel. The film premiered at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival where it received positive reviews. Davis later earned the AACTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role.

===Stage===
Davis&#x27;s stage work has been mostly confined to Australia. Early in her career, she played Juliet opposite Mel Gibson&#x27;s Romeo. In 1978, she appeared in &quot;Visions&quot; by Louis Nowra at the Paris Theatre Company in Sydney. In 1980, she portrayed French chanteuse Edith Piaf in Stephen Barry&#x27;s production of the Pam Gems play &quot;Piaf&quot; at the Perth Playhouse. She played both Cordelia and the Fool in a 1984 staging of &quot;King Lear&quot; by the Nimrod Theatre Company, and also starred in its productions of Strindberg&#x27;s &quot;Miss Julie&quot;, Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;The Bear&quot;, Louis Nowra&#x27;s &quot;Inside The Island&quot; and, in 1986, the title role of Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; for the Sydney Theatre Company.

In 2004, she starred in and co-directed Howard Barker&#x27;s play &quot;Victory&quot;, as a Puritan woman determined to locate her husband&#x27;s dismembered corpse. Other stage directorial efforts include Sheridan&#x27;s &quot;The School For Scandal&quot; and &quot;Barrymore&quot; by William Luce (all three for the Sydney Theatre Company). She created the role of The Actress in Terry Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Insignificance&quot; at the Royal Court in London, receiving an Olivier Award nomination, and appeared in a brief 1989 Los Angeles production of Tom Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;Hapgood&quot;. Writing for &quot;Philadelphia&quot; magazine, David Fox found her &quot;marvelous in the title role, as charismatic and commanding on stage as she is in film.&quot;

In 2011, she portrayed the role of fading actress Irina Arkadina in Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;The Seagull&quot; at Sydney&#x27;s Belvoir St Theatre. Paul Chai of &quot;&quot;Variety&quot;&quot; praised her performance as Irina, writing, &quot;Davis manages to instill Irina with not only a diva&#x27;s haughty air and crafty manipulation but also with the right hint of fragility, as evidenced in her concern about being upstaged by the youthful and beautiful Nina.&quot;

==Awards and accolades==
Davis has received numerous accolades including nine AACTA Awards, two BAFTA Awards, three Primetime Emmy Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, an Independent Spirit Award, and a Screen Actors Guild Award. She also received nominations for two Academy Awards and a Laurence Olivier Award. She is the first Australian to receive Academy Award nominations in both categories of Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress and the fourth Australian actress to receive an Academy Award nomination.

She has won BAFTA Awards for both Best Actress and Most Promising Newcomer for the film &quot;My Brilliant Career&quot; (1979), and later received Academy Award nominations for &quot;A Passage to India&quot; (1984) and &quot;Husbands and Wives&quot; (1992). She earned a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress nomination for the 1982 London production of &quot;Insignificance&quot;. 

For her work on television, Davis won Primetime Emmy Awards for &quot;Serving in Silence: The Margarethe Cammermeyer Story&quot; (1995), for playing Judy Garland in &quot;Life with Judy Garland: Me and My Shadows&quot; (2001) and &quot;The Starter Wife&quot; (2007) and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film for &quot;Life with Judy Garland: Me and My Shadows&quot; and &quot;One Against the Wind&quot; (1991).

<text>Gigantism (, &quot;gígas&quot;, &quot;&quot;, plural γίγαντες, &quot;gígantes&quot;), also known as giantism, is a condition characterized by excessive growth and height significantly above average. In humans, this condition is caused by over-production of growth hormone in childhood.

It is a rare disorder resulting from increased levels of growth hormone before the fusion of the growth plate which usually occurs at some point soon after puberty. This increase is most often due to abnormal tumor growths on the pituitary gland. Gigantism should not be confused with acromegaly, the adult form of the disorder, characterized by somatic enlargement specifically in the extremities and face.

==Cause==
Gigantism is characterized by an excess of growth hormone (GH). The excess of growth hormone that brings about gigantism is virtually always caused by pituitary growths (adenomas). These adenomas are on the anterior pituitary gland. They can also cause overproduction of GH&#x27;s hypothalamic precursor known as growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH).

As a result of the excessive amounts of growth hormone, children achieve heights that are well above normal ranges. The specific age of onset for gigantism varies between patients and gender, but the common age that excessive growth symptoms start to appear has been found to be around 13 years. Other health complications, such as hypertension, may occur in pediatric patients with hyper-secretion of growth hormone. Characteristics more similar to those seen in acromegaly may occur in patients that are closer in age to adolescence since they are nearing growth plate fusion.

===Hormonal cause===
Growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) are two substances that have been identified as influencing growth plate formation and bone growth and, therefore, gigantism. Their specific mechanisms are still not well understood.

More broadly, GH and IGF have both been identified to be involved in most stages of growth: embryonic, prenatal, and postnatal. Moreover, the receptor gene for IGF has been shown to be particularly influential throughout various stages of development, especially prenatally. This is the same for GH receptor genes which have been known to drive overall growth throughout various pathways.

Growth hormone is a precursor (upstream) of IGF-I, but each has its independent role in hormonal pathways. Yet both seem to ultimately come together to have a joint effect on growth.

===Diagnostic testing===
Evaluation of growth hormone hypersecretion cannot be excluded with a single normal GH level due to diurnal variation. However, a random blood sample showing markedly elevated GH is adequate for diagnosis of GH hyper-secretion. Additionally, a high-normal GH level that fails to suppress with administration of glucose is also sufficient for a diagnosis of GH hyper-secretion.

Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is an excellent test for evaluation of GH hyper-secretion. It does not undergo diurnal variation and will thus be consistently elevated in GH hyper-secretion and therefore patients with gigantism. A single normal IGF-1 value will reliably exclude GH hypersecretion.

==Genetics==

Finding a specific genetic cause for gigantism has proven to be difficult. Gigantism is the primary example of growth hormone hyper-secretion disorders, a group of illnesses that are not yet deeply understood.

Some common mutations have been associated with gigantism. Pediatric gigantism patients have shown to have duplications of genes on a specific chromosome, Xq26. Typically, these patients also experienced an onset of typical gigantism symptoms before reaching the age of 5. This indicates a possible linkage between gene duplications and the gigantism.

Additionally, DNA mutations in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein (AIP) gene are common in gigantism patients. They have been found to be present in about 29 percent of patients with gigantism. AIP is labeled as a tumor suppressor gene and a pituitary adenoma disposition gene.

Mutations in AIP, found by sequencing, can have deleterious effects by inducing the development of pituitary adenomas which in turn can cause gigantism.

Two specific mutations in the AIP gene have been identified as possible causes of pituitary adenomas. These mutations also have the ability to cause adenoma growth to occur early in life. This is typical in gigantism.

Additionally, a large variety of other known genetic disorders have been found to influence the development of gigantism such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 and 4, McCune–Albright syndrome, Carney complex, familial isolated pituitary adenoma, X-linked acrogigantism (X-LAG).

Although various gene mutations have been associated with gigantism, over 50 percent of cases cannot be linked to genetic causes, showing the complex nature of the disorder.

==Treatment==
Many treatments for gigantism receive criticism and are not accepted as ideal. Various treatments involving surgery and drugs have been used to treat gigantism.

===Pharmaceuticals===
Pegvisomant is one pharmaceutical drug which has received attention for being a possible treatment route for gigantism. Reduction of the levels of IGF-I as a result of pegvisomant administration can be incredibly beneficial for the pediatric gigantism patients.

After treatment with pegvisomant, high growth rates, a feature characteristic of gigantism, can be significantly decreased. Pegvisomant has been seen to be a powerful alternative to other treatments such as somatostatin analogues, a common treatment method for acromegaly, if drug treatment is paired with radiation.

Finding the optimal level of pegvisomant is important so normal body growth is not negatively affected. In order to do this, titration of the medication can be used as a way to find the proper administration level.

See acromegaly for additional treatment possibilities.

==Terminology==

The term is typically applied to those whose height is not just in the upper 1% of the population but several standard deviations above mean for persons of the same sex, age, and ethnic ancestry. The term is seldom applied to those who are simply &quot;tall&quot; or &quot;above average&quot; whose heights appear to be the result of normal genetics and nutrition. Gigantism is usually caused by a tumor on the pituitary gland of the brain. It causes growth of the hands, face, and feet. In some cases the condition can be passed on genetically through a mutated gene.

Other names somewhat obsolete for this pathology are hypersoma (Greek: &quot;hyper&quot; over the normal level; &quot;soma&quot; body) and somatomegaly (Greek; &quot;soma&quot; body, genitive &quot;somatos&quot; of the body; &quot;megas&quot;, gen. &quot;megalou&quot; great). In the past, while many of them were social outcasts because of their height, some (usually unintentionally) found employment in Friedrich Wilhelm I&#x27;s famous Potsdam Giants regiment.

Many of those who have been identified with gigantism have had multiple health problems involving the circulatory or skeletal system, as the strain of maintaining a large, heavy body places abnormal demands on both the bones and the heart.

<text>Methylthioninium chloride, commonly called methylene blue, is a salt used as a dye and as a medication. As a medication, it is mainly used to treat methemoglobinemia. It has previously been used for treating cyanide poisoning and urinary tract infections, but this use is no longer recommended.
Methylene blue is typically given by injection into a vein. Common side effects include headache, nausea, and vomiting. 
Methylene blue was first prepared in 1876, by Heinrich Caro. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.

==Uses==

===Methemoglobinemia===
Methylene blue is used to treat methemoglobinemia by chemically reducing the ferric iron in hemoglobin to ferrous iron. Methemoglobinemia can arise from ingestion of certain pharmaceuticals, toxins, or broad beans in those susceptible. Specifically, it is used to treat methemoglobin levels that are greater than 30% or in which there are symptoms despite oxygen therapy. Normally, through the NADH- or NADPH-dependent methemoglobin reductase enzymes, methemoglobin is reduced back to hemoglobin. When large amounts of methemoglobin occur secondary to toxins, methemoglobin reductases are overwhelmed. Methylene blue, when injected intravenously as an antidote, is itself first reduced to leucomethylene blue, which then reduces the heme group from methemoglobin to hemoglobin. Methylene blue can reduce the half life of methemoglobin from hours to minutes. At high doses, however, methylene blue actually induces methemoglobinemia, reversing this pathway.

====Isobutyl nitrite toxicity====
Isobutyl nitrite is one of the compounds used as poppers, an inhalant drug that induces a brief euphoria.

Isobutyl nitrite is known to cause methemoglobinemia. Severe methemoglobinemia may be treated with methylene blue.

===In a combination drug : Methylphen===
===Cyanide poisoning===
Since its reduction potential is similar to that of oxygen and can be reduced by components of the electron transport chain, large doses of methylene blue are sometimes used as an antidote to potassium cyanide poisoning, a method first successfully tested in 1933 by Matilda Moldenhauer Brooks in San Francisco, although first demonstrated by Bo Sahlin of Lund University, in 1926.

===Dye or stain===
Methylene blue is used in endoscopic polypectomy as an adjunct to saline or epinephrine, and is used for injection into the submucosa around the polyp to be removed. This allows the submucosal tissue plane to be identified after the polyp is removed, which is useful in determining if more tissue needs to be removed, or if there has been a high risk for perforation. Methylene blue is also used as a dye in chromoendoscopy, and is sprayed onto the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract in order to identify dysplasia, or pre-cancerous lesions. Intravenously injected methylene blue is readily released into the urine and thus can be used to test the urinary tract for leaks or fistulas.

In surgeries such as sentinel lymph node dissections, methylene blue can be used to visually trace the lymphatic drainage of tested tissues. Similarly, methylene blue is added to bone cement in orthopedic operations to provide easy discrimination between native bone and cement. Additionally, methylene blue accelerates the hardening of bone cement, increasing the speed at which bone cement can be effectively applied. Methylene blue is used as an aid to visualisation/orientation in a number of medical devices, including a Surgical sealant film, TissuePatch. In fistulas and pilonidal sinuses it is used to identify the tract for complete excision. It can also be used during gastrointestinal surgeries (such as bowel resection or gastric bypass) to test for leaks.

It is sometimes used in cytopathology, in mixtures including Wright-Giemsa and Diff-Quik. It confers a blue color to both nuclei and cytoplasm, and makes the nuclei more visible. When methylene blue is &quot;polychromed&quot; (oxidized in solution or &quot;ripened&quot; by fungal metabolism, as originally noted in the thesis of Dr. D. L. Romanowsky in the 1890s), it gets serially demethylated and forms all the tri-, di-, mono- and non-methyl intermediates, which are Azure B, Azure A, Azure C, and thionine, respectively. This is the basis of the basophilic part of the spectrum of Romanowski-Giemsa effect. If only synthetic Azure B and Eosin Y is used, it may serve as a standardized Giemsa stain; but, without methylene blue, the normal neutrophilic granules tend to overstain and look like toxic granules. On the other hand, if methylene blue is used it might help to give the normal look of neutrophil granules and may also enhance the staining of nucleoli and polychromatophilic RBCs (reticulocytes).
A traditional application of methylene blue is the intravital or supravital staining of nerve fibers, an effect first described by Paul Ehrlich in 1887. A dilute solution of the dye is either injected into tissue or applied to small freshly removed pieces. The selective blue coloration develops with exposure to air (oxygen) and can be fixed by immersion of the stained specimen in an aqueous solution of ammonium molybdate. Vital methylene blue was formerly much used for examining the innervation of muscle, skin and internal organs. The mechanism of selective dye uptake is incompletely understood; vital staining of nerve fibers in skin is prevented by ouabain, a drug that inhibits the Na/K-ATPase of cell membranes.

===Placebo===
Methylene blue has been used as a placebo; physicians would tell their patients to expect their urine to change color and view this as a sign that their condition had improved. This same side effect makes methylene blue difficult to use in traditional placebo-controlled clinical studies, including those testing for its efficacy as a treatment.

===Ifosfamide toxicity===
Another use of methylene blue is to treat ifosfamide neurotoxicity. Methylene blue was first reported for treatment and prophylaxis of ifosfamide neuropsychiatric toxicity in 1994. A toxic metabolite of ifosfamide, chloroacetaldehyde (CAA), disrupts the mitochondrial respiratory chain, leading to an accumulation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrogen (NADH). Methylene blue acts as an alternative electron acceptor, and reverses the NADH inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis while also inhibiting the transformation of chloroethylamine into chloroacetaldehyde, and inhibits multiple amine oxidase activities, preventing the formation of CAA. The dosing of methylene blue for treatment of ifosfamide neurotoxicity varies, depending upon its use simultaneously as an adjuvant in ifosfamide infusion, versus its use to reverse psychiatric symptoms that manifest after completion of an ifosfamide infusion. Reports suggest that methylene blue up to six doses a day have resulted in improvement of symptoms within 10 minutes to several days. Alternatively, it has been suggested that intravenous methylene blue every six hours for prophylaxis during ifosfamide treatment in people with history of ifosfamide neuropsychiatric toxicity. Prophylactic administration of methylene blue the day before initiation of ifosfamide, and three times daily during ifosfamide chemotherapy has been recommended to lower the occurrence of ifosfamide neurotoxicity.

===Shock===
Methylene blue increases blood pressure in people with vasoplegic syndrome (redistributive shock), but does not improve delivery of oxygen to tissues or decrease mortality.

Methylene blue has been used in calcium channel blocker toxicity as a possible rescue therapy for distributive shock unresponsive to first line agents. Limited to case reports, a 2024 review found low-quality evidence that methylene blue may reduce short-term mortality, duration of the need for vasopressors, and length of hospital stay.

===Malaria===
Antimalarial use of the drug has recently (2009) been revived. It simutaneously targets many biological processes in the apicomplexan pathogen, though the main mechanism seems to be causing a lethal amount of redox cycling.

A 2018 meta-analysis finds that it has proven effective against &quot;P. falciparum&quot; in Africa. It effectively reduces levels of the transmission-stage gametocyte and has synergy with the standard artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT).

==Side effects==
Methylene blue is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) and, if infused intravenously at doses exceeding 5 mg/kg, may result in serotonin syndrome if combined with any selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or other serotonergic drugs (e.g., duloxetine, sibutramine, venlafaxine, clomipramine, imipramine).

It causes hemolytic anemia in carriers of the G6PD enzymatic deficiency (favism). The actual degree of this danger is a subject of controversy as the association was made based on very few cases. A 2018 meta-analysis on clinical trials against malaria in Africa, where the moderate A minus type of G6PD deficiency is prevalant, show no association between MB and hemolysis in such patients. There was, however, a clinically-insignificant reduction in hemoglobin.

== Pregnancy ==
While use during pregnancy may harm the fetus, not using it in methemoglobinemia is likely more dangerous.

== Pharmacokinetics ==
After intravenous administration in humans, methylene blue shows a multiphasic change in concentration, with a terminal half-life of 5.25 hours. The initial disappearance from blood actually reflects its movement into organs, with brain, liver, and bile all showing significantly higher concentrations than blood in rats. The overall area under the curve in oral (dry gelatin capsule) administration is only 6.5% of the AUC for iv administration; judging from rat studies, the siginificantly altered organ distribution plays a key role in this difference.

Administration as an oral solution (500 mg in 200 mL) greatly increases the bioavailbility to 72.3±23.9%. In this newer study, the terminal half-lives were reported as 18.5±11.8 hours for iv use and 18.3±7.2 for oral use.

==Chemistry==
Methylene blue is a formal derivative of phenothiazine. It is a dark green powder that yields a blue solution in water. The hydrated form has 3 molecules of water per unit of methylene blue. 

===Preparation===
This compound is prepared by oxidation of 4-aminodimethylaniline in the presence of sodium thiosulfate to give the quinonediiminothiosulfonic acid, reaction with dimethylaniline, oxidation to the indamine, and cyclization to give the thiazine:
A green electrochemical procedure, using only dimethyl-4-phenylenediamine and sulfide ions has been proposed.

===Light absorption properties===

The maximum absorption of light is near 670 nm. The specifics of absorption depend on a number of factors, including protonation, adsorption to other materials, and metachromasy - the formation of dimers and higher-order aggregates depending on concentration and other interactions:

=== Redox properties ===

Under reducing conditions, the blue-colored methylene blue cation (MB+) gains 1H+ and 2e- to become the electrically neutral and colorless leucomethylene blue (LMB). The redox midpoint potential E&#x27; is +0.01 V.

The redox properties can be seen in a classical demonstration of chemical kinetics in general chemistry, the &quot;blue bottle&quot; experiment. Typically, a solution is made of glucose (dextrose), methylene blue, and sodium hydroxide. Upon shaking the bottle, oxygen oxidizes methylene blue, and the solution turns blue. The dextrose will gradually reduce the methylene blue to its colorless, reduced form. Hence, when the dissolved dextrose is entirely consumed, the solution will turn blue again.

==Other uses==

===Redox indicator===
Methylene blue is widely used as a redox indicator in analytical chemistry. Solutions of this substance are blue when in an oxidizing environment, but will turn colorless if exposed to a reducing agent.

===Photosensitizer===
Methylene blue is also a photosensitizer used to create singlet oxygen when exposed to both oxygen and light. It is used in this regard to make organic peroxides by a Diels-Alder reaction which is spin forbidden with normal atmospheric triplet oxygen.

With the help of light, methylene blue can be used to kill some viruses and some bacteria. This kind of photo-disinfection has also been done inside of human bodies (antimicrobial photodynamic therapy).

Methylene blue is theoretically also applicable to other forms of photodynamic therapy, i.e. the use of oxygen, light, and a photosentizer to kill cells. Research on using it to locally kill cancer cells is in a preclincal stage.

===Sulfide analysis===
The formation of methylene blue after the reaction of hydrogen sulfide with dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine and iron(III) at pH 0.4 – 0.7 is used to determine by photometric measurements sulfide concentration in the range 0.020 to 1.50 mg/L (20 ppb to 1.5 ppm). The test is very sensitive and the blue coloration developing upon contact of the reagents with dissolved H2S is stable for 60 min. Ready-to-use kits such as the &quot;Spectroquant&quot; sulfide test facilitate routine analyses. The methylene blue sulfide test is a convenient method often used in soil microbiology to quickly detect in water the metabolic activity of sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB). In this colorimetric test, methylene blue is a product formed by the reaction and not a reagent added to the system.

The addition of a strong reducing agent, such as ascorbic acid, to a sulfide-containing solution is sometimes used to prevent sulfide oxidation from atmospheric oxygen. Although it is certainly a sound precaution for the determination of sulfide with an ion selective electrode, it might however hamper the development of the blue color if the freshly formed methylene blue is also reduced, as described here above in the paragraph on redox indicator.

===Test for milk freshness===
Methylene blue is a dye behaving as a redox indicator that is commonly used in the food industry to test the freshness of milk and dairy products. A few drops of methylene blue solution added to a sample of milk should remain blue (oxidized form in the presence of enough dissolved ), otherwise (discoloration caused by the reduction of methylene blue into its colorless reduced form) the dissolved concentration in the milk sample is low indicating that the milk is not fresh (already abiotically oxidized by whose concentration in solution decreases) or could be contaminated by bacteria also consuming the atmospheric dissolved in the milk. In other words, aerobic conditions should prevail in fresh milk and methylene blue is simply used as an indicator of the dissolved oxygen remaining in the milk.

===Water testing===
The adsorption of methylene blue serves as an indicator defining the adsorptive capacity of granular activated carbon in water filters. Adsorption of methylene blue is very similar to adsorption of pesticides from water, this quality makes methylene blue serve as a good predictor for filtration qualities of carbon. It is as well a quick method of comparing different batches of activated carbon of the same quality.
A color reaction in an acidified, aqueous methylene blue solution containing chloroform can detect anionic surfactants in a water sample. Such a test is known as an MBAS assay (methylene blue active substances assay).

The MBAS assay cannot distinguish between specific surfactants, however. Some examples of anionic surfactants are carboxylates, phosphates, sulfates, and sulfonates.

===Methylene blue value of fine aggregate===
The methylene blue value is defined as the number of milliliter&#x27;s standard methylene value solution decolorized 0.1 g of activated carbon (dry basis).
Methylene blue value reflects the amount of clay minerals in aggregate samples. In materials science, methylene blue solution is successively added to fine aggregate which is being agitated in water. The presence of free dye solution can be checked with stain test on a filter paper.

===Biological staining===

In biology, methylene blue is used as a dye for a number of different staining procedures, such as Wright&#x27;s stain and Jenner&#x27;s stain. Since it is a temporary staining technique, methylene blue can also be used to examine RNA or DNA under the microscope or in a gel: as an example, a solution of methylene blue can be used to stain RNA on hybridization membranes in northern blotting to verify the amount of nucleic acid present. While methylene blue is not as sensitive as ethidium bromide, it is less toxic and it does not intercalate in nucleic acid chains, thus avoiding interference with nucleic acid retention on hybridization membranes or with the hybridization process itself.

It can also be used as an indicator to determine whether eukaryotic cells such as yeast are alive or dead. The methylene blue is reduced in viable cells, leaving them unstained. However dead cells are unable to reduce the oxidized methylene blue and the cells are stained blue. Methylene blue can interfere with the respiration of the yeast as it picks up hydrogen ions made during the process.

===Aquaculture===
* Methylene blue is used in aquaculture and by tropical fish hobbyists as a treatment for fungal infections. With the help of light it is also effective against bacteria and viruses.
* It can also be effective in treating fish infected with the parasitic protozoa &quot;Ichthyophthirius multifiliis&quot; (ich), although a combination of malachite green and formaldehyde is far more effective against it.
* Methylene blue also works against nitrite poisoning as it treats the resulting methemoglobinemia. Like in humans, it also treats cyanide poisoning.
* Non-professional sources also claim that it works for ammonia poisoning, but there is little medical literature to back this up.

It is usually used to protect newly laid fish eggs from being infected by fungus. This is useful when the hobbyist wants to artificially hatch the fish eggs. For poisoning, injury (prevention of infection), or sickness, methylene blue is given as a &quot;medicated bath&quot; for the fish.

Methylene blue is not without side effects to fish.

==History==
Methylene blue has been described as &quot;the first fully synthetic drug used in medicine&quot;. Methylene blue was first prepared in 1876 by German chemist Heinrich Caro.

Its use in the treatment of malaria was pioneered by Paul Guttmann and Paul Ehrlich in 1891. During this period before the first World War, researchers like Ehrlich believed that drugs and dyes worked in the same way, by preferentially staining pathogens and possibly harming them. Changing the cell membrane of pathogens is in fact how various drugs work, so the theory was partially correct, although far from complete. Methylene blue continued to be used in the second World War, where it was not well-liked by soldiers, who observed: &quot;Even at the loo, we see, we pee, navy blue.&quot; 

It was discovered to be an antidote to carbon monoxide poisoning and cyanide poisoning in 1933 by Matilda Brooks.

<text>Barbara of Portugal (Maria Madalena Bárbara Xavier Leonor Teresa Antónia Josefa; 4 December 1711 – 27 August 1758) was an Infanta of Portugal, and a Queen of Spain by marriage to Ferdinand VI of Spain.

==Life==

===Princess of Portugal===
The marriage of King John V of Portugal and Archduchess Maria Anna of Austria remained childless for nearly three years. The king made a promise to God that if an heir to the throne was born, a great convent would be built as a sign of gratitude. On 4 December 1711, a daughter was finally born, and the king built the Convent of Mafra. The child was baptised &quot;Maria Madalena Bárbara Xavier Leonor Teresa Antónia Josefa&quot;, honouring a number of saints and relatives, and styled Princess of Brazil as the heir presumptive to the Portuguese throne. She was usually referred to as &quot;Bárbara&quot; or &quot;Maria Bárbara&quot; after Saint Barbara, the saint of her birthday, a name never used before among Portuguese royalty.

Two years later, Barbara&#x27;s mother gave birth to a son, Pedro, and she ceased to be heir presumptive. Pedro died at the age of two, but by that time, the queen had already had another son, Joseph, and hence Barbara never became heir presumptive again.

Barbara had a fine education and loved music. A prodigiously talented keyboard player, she was the sole pupil of Domenico Scarlatti, the great harpsichordist and composer, from age 9 or 10 until 1757, when Scarlatti died, a year before her own death.

In 1725, Barbara was among the seventeen princesses seriously considered for marriage to king Louis XV of France, when the list of the original 99 had been reduced. However, there were concerns about the perceived weak physical and mental health of her family as well as her young age, and in the end she was removed from the list.

===Princess of Asturias===
In 1729 at the age 18, Barbara married the future Ferdinand VI of Spain, two years her junior. Her brother Joseph married Ferdinand&#x27;s half-sister, the Spanish Infanta Mariana Victoria, who had been rejected as a bride for Louis XV. The double marriage, known as the Exchange of the Princesses, was meant to repair the Portuguese-Spanish alliance. Scarlatti followed Barbara to Madrid after her marriage and remained with her, composing hundreds of harpsichord sonatas for her.

During their time as Prince and Princess of the Asturias, Ferdinand and Barbara became the target of the opposition known as the Spanish party, in parallel with Spain&#x27;s deteriorating relations with Portugal. From 1733 until 1737 they were kept more or less under house arrest in their apartments, prevented from appearing in public and watched by the spies of Queen Elizabeth. This gave Barbara the time to deepen her relationship with Ferdinand, a timid person who suffered also from ill health.

Barbara was not considered beautiful by her contemporaries, and her homely looks were thought by observers to have caused her future husband a visible shock when he was first presented to her. However, &#x27;Ferdinand the Learned&#x27; (as he was later known) became deeply attached to her, sharing her passion for music and soon becoming dependent on her for advice and support. When he ascended the Spanish throne as Ferdinand VI, the French ambassador noted &quot;it is rather Barbara who succeeds Elizabeth [Ferdinand&#x27;s step-mother] than Ferdinand succeeding Philippe.&quot; Barbara was well-educated, and in addition to her musical talents was adept at languages and was an avid reader on many varied subjects.

===Queen of Spain===
Upon their succession, Barbara was exposed to attempts to drive a political wedge between her and Ferdinand, engineered by, among others, supporters of the Queen Dowager, and she formed an alliance with three members of the Spanish party, who had been in opposition during the previous regime, Ensenada, Huescar and Carvajal. She thus secured the Spanish party as her supporters and obtained the dismissal of all power holders of the previous regime who threatened her influence over Ferdinand. Encouraged by Barbara, Ferdinand fired the minister Villarias, who was replaced by Carvajal, and in July 1747 the Queen Dowager was banished from court.

During her husband&#x27;s reign, Barbara was to preside over magnificent parties and concerts at her favorite retreat, the Royal Palace of Aranjuez. However, in contrast to her predecessor as queen, Barbara did not like to flaunt her influence over her spouse and the government policy, and she made a moderately positive impression upon the public. She was not as self-assured, nor did she have as much political ambition as Elisabeth Farnese, and her policy focused mainly upon a friendly relationship between Spain and Portugal in cooperation with her father and the Portuguese ambassador Belmonte. 
Queen Barbara participated regularly in the affairs of state: the ministers, who respected her, presented to her all documents of state before they were given to the king, because: &quot;only she knows what ought either be said or hidden from the king&quot;: she was the channel through which the ministers worked with the king, as it was she who advised them how to achieve the desired result from the king, and the ministers relied upon her for their work as, the British ambassador Benjamin Keene reported: &quot;She can sway him as she pleases, with as much power, but much less difficulty, than ever the Dowager did with the late King, his father.&quot; In 1754, she was behind the fall of her previous ally Ensenada. Keene and Huascar presented the Queen with a paper implying that minister Ensenada was making puppets of the royal couple. They succeeded in convincing her to act against Ensenada, and in cooperation with Richard Wall and Huascar, Barbara convinced Ferdinand to exile Ensenada.

The couple produced no children who survived, with Barbara having a stillborn son in 1733. Barbara suffered from severe asthma for most of her life and in later years became overweight. She died at the Royal Palace of Aranjuez, on the outskirts of Madrid on 27 August 1758. Her death was said to have broken her husband&#x27;s heart.

<doc id="238799" wikidata="Q20141" url="?curid=238799" title="Pointing stick">
<text>A pointing stick (or trackpoint, also referred to generically as a nub or nipple) is a small analog stick used as a pointing device typically mounted centrally in a computer keyboard. Like other pointing devices such as mice, touchpads or trackballs, operating system software translates manipulation of the device into movements of the pointer on the computer screen. Unlike other pointing devices, it reacts to sustained force or strain rather than to gross movement, so it is called an &quot;isometric&quot; pointing device. IBM introduced it commercially in 1992 on the ThinkPad 700 series under the name &quot;TrackPoint&quot;, and patented an improved version of it in 1997 (but the patent expired in 2017). It has been used for business laptops, such as Acer&#x27;s TravelMate, Dell&#x27;s Latitude, HP&#x27;s EliteBook and Lenovo&#x27;s ThinkPad.

The pointing stick senses applied force by using two pairs of resistive strain gauges. A pointing stick can be used by pushing with the fingers in the general direction the user wants the pointer to move. The velocity of the pointer depends on the applied force so increasing pressure causes faster movement. The relation between pressure and pointer speed can be adjusted, just as mouse speed is adjusted.

On a QWERTY keyboard, the stick is typically embedded between the G, H and B keys, and the mouse buttons are placed just below the space bar. The mouse buttons can be operated right-handed or left-handed due to their placement below the keyboard along the centerline. This pointing device has also appeared next to screens on compact-sized laptops such as the Toshiba Libretto and Sony VAIO UX.

== Variants ==
Pointing sticks typically have a replaceable rubber cap, called a nub, which can be a slightly rough &quot;eraser head&quot; material or another shape.

The cap is red on ThinkPads, but is also found in other colors on other machines. It may be gray, pink, black or blue on some Dell models, blue on some HP/Compaq laptops, and green or gray on most Toshiba laptops produced before the 2000s.

Button configurations vary depending on vendor and laptop model. ThinkPads have a prominent middle mouse button, but some models have no physical buttons. Toshiba employs concentric arcs.

In the early 1990s, Zenith Data Systems shipped a number of laptop computers equipped with a device called J-Mouse, which essentially used a special keyswitch under the J key to allow the J keycap to be used as a pointing stick.

In addition to appearing between the G, H and B keys on a QWERTY keyboard, these devices or similar can also appear on gaming devices as an alternative to a D-pad or analog stick. On certain Toshiba Libretto mini laptops, the pointing stick was located next to the display. IBM sold a mouse with a pointing stick in the location where a scroll wheel is common now.

Optical pointing sticks are also used on some Ultrabook tablet hybrids, such as the Sony Duo 11, ThinkPad Tablet and Samsung Ativ Q.

On the Gateway 2000 Liberty laptop the pointing stick is above the enter key on the right side of the keyboard.

A pointing stick was featured in the New Nintendo 3DS as a secondary analog stick, known as the C-Stick.

== Design challenges ==
The IBM TrackPoint III and the TrackPoint IV have a feature called Negative Inertia that causes the pointer&#x27;s velocity to &quot;overreact&quot; when it is accelerated or decelerated. Negative Inertia is intended to avoid the feeling of inertia or sluggishness when starting or stopping movement. Usability tests at IBM have shown that it is easier for users to position the pointer with Negative Inertia, and performance is 7.8% better.

Another challenge with pointing stick design is identification of the zero position (the position where no motion is desired). Because the amount of motion is small, the sensitivity of the sensors must be high, and they are subject to noise interference.

A typical solution, which assumes that pointing sticks frequently go out of calibration, is to interpret a variation below a certain threshold (over a given interval, perhaps one or several seconds) as being a neutral stick. However, the recalibration can also allow brief periods of &#x27;drifting&#x27; (movement of the pointer while the user is not moving the pointing stick).

In practice, if the re-calibration interval is set too short and if the user applies moderately consistent pressure to the stick for such an interval, this method results in an incorrect zero point. Additional pressure again moves the pointer, but the calibration may occur again, requiring even more force. If the user releases pressure at this point, the change will be interpreted as an instruction to move the opposite direction. In time, the software will re-calibrate and stop the motion.

Additionally, if &quot;press-to-select&quot; is enabled, the software may generate unexpected click events by touching the pointing stick during typing.

== History ==

In 1984, Ted Selker, a researcher at PARC, worked on a pointing stick based on a study showing that it takes a typist 0.75 seconds to shift from the keyboard to the mouse, and comparable time to shift back. Selker built a model of a device that would minimize this time. It was only three years later, working at IBM, that Selker refined his design, resulting in the TrackPoint product for which IBM received US patents in 1996 and 2000.

Pointing sticks were the dominant pointing device for laptops before the advent of the touchpad. During later years, they faced a decline in popularity as most laptop-producing brands switched to touchpads, although as of 2021, some manufacturers like Lenovo still produce laptops with pointing sticks.

== Problem scope==
=== Space constraints===

The pointing stick can be used in ultra-compact netbooks where there would be no place for a touchpad.

=== Finger motion reduction ===
The pointing stick is positioned such that the hands do not need to be removed from the home row to manipulate the mouse pointer.

=== Continuous motion ===
Some people find them more appealing for mobile gaming than a touchpad, because the trackpoint allows infinite movement without repositioning. This is because a user&#x27;s finger may run off the edge of a touchpad while positioning the pointer, requiring them to reposition their finger in order to continue.

=== Ergonomics ===
Some users feel that pointing sticks cause less wrist strain because a user does not need to avoid resting wrists on a touchpad, which are usually located just below the keyboard. One criticism is that because the pointing stick depends on the user&#x27;s applying pressure, it can cause hand cramps (although this can be partly solved by setting the sensitivity higher and lifting the finger when the pointer is not being moved).
Another criticism is that it stresses the index finger and may lead to repetitive strain injury.

A number of ergonomic studies to compare trackpoint and touchpad performance have been performed. Most studies find that touchpad is slightly faster; one study found that &quot;the touchpad was operated 15% faster than the trackpoint&quot;. Another study found that average object selection time was faster with a touchpad, 1.7 seconds compared to 2.2 seconds with a trackpoint, and object manipulation took 6.2 seconds with a touchpad, on average, against 8.1 seconds with trackpoint.

== Naming and brands ==

=== Informal names ===
Various informal names have been invented, including &quot;nub&quot;, &quot;clit mouse&quot;, which is an intercommunity term, usually seen on ThinkPad forums, and &quot;nipple mouse&quot;.

== Other uses ==

While typically employed on a computer keyboard, IBM included one on its Trackpoint Mouse product; suggested uses included scrolling (as with a scroll wheel) or a dual-cursor system.

<doc id="238800" wikidata="Q2891323" url="?curid=238800" title="Suppressed correlative">
<text>The fallacy of suppressed correlative is a type of argument that tries to redefine a correlative (one of two mutually exclusive options) so that one alternative encompasses the other, i.e. making one alternative impossible. This has also been known as the fallacy of lost contrast and the fallacy of the suppressed relative.

==Description==

A conceptual example:

:Person 1: &quot;All things are either X or not X.&quot; &quot;(The correlatives: X–not X.)&quot;
:Person 2: &quot;I define X such that all things that you claim are not X are included in X.&quot; &quot;(The suppressed correlative: not X.)&quot;

Alternatively Person 2 can redefine X in way that instead concludes all things are not X.

A simple example based on one by Alexander Bain:

:Person 1: &quot;Things are either mysterious or not mysterious. Exactly when an earthquake will strike is still a mystery, but how blood circulates in the body is not.&quot;
:Person 2: &quot;&quot;Everything&quot; is mysterious. There are still things to be learned about how blood circulates.&quot;

Regardless of whether Person 2&#x27;s statement about blood circulation is true or not, the redefinition of &quot;mysterious&quot; is so broad that it omits significant contrast in the level of scientific understanding between earthquakes and blood circulation. Bain argues that if we hold the origin of the universe as equally mysterious against simple equations such as 3×4=12, it seems unimaginable what kind of concepts would be described as &quot;non&quot;-mysterious. Through redefinition, the word &quot;mysterious&quot; has lost any useful meaning, he says.

The redefinition is not always so obvious. At first glance it might appear reasonable to define brakes as &quot;a method to quickly stop a vehicle&quot;; however, this permits all vehicles to be described as having brakes. A sled could be driven into a sturdy barrier to stop it, but to therefore say the sled has brakes seems absurd.

This type of fallacy is often used in conjunction with one of the fallacies of definition. It is an informal fallacy.

==Usage==

The Scottish logician Alexander Bain discussed the fallacy of suppressed correlative, which he also called the fallacy of suppressed relative, in the 19th century. He provided many example relative pairs where the correlative terms find their meaning through contrast: rest-toil, knowledge-ignorance, silence-speech, and so on. Bain classified this type of error as a fallacy of relativity, which in turn was one of many fallacies of confusion.

J. Loewenberg rejected a certain definition of empirical method – one that seemed so broad as to encompass all possible methods – as committing the fallacy of suppressed correlative. This error has been said to be found in the philosophy of some empiricists, including Edgar S. Brightman, sometimes in broadening the meaning of other terms relevant to these arguments, such as &quot;perception&quot; (when taken to include entirely cognitive processes in addition to ones usually classified as perceptual).

Critics identify the fallacy in arguments for psychological egoism, which proposes that all actions conducted by individuals are motivated by their own self-interest. Outside of this idea it is believed that sometimes people do things selflessly, such as acts of charitable giving or self-sacrifice. Psychological egoism explains all scenarios entirely in terms of selfish motivations (e.g., that acting for one&#x27;s own purposes is an act of self-interest); however, critics charge that in doing so they are redefining selfishness to the point where it encompasses all motivated actions and thus makes the term meaningless.

<text>Anna Anderson (born Franziska Schanzkowska; 16 December 1896 – 12 February 1984) was an impostor who claimed to be Grand Duchess Anastasia of Russia. Anastasia, the youngest daughter of the last Tsar and Tsarina of Russia, Nicholas II and Alexandra, was murdered along with her parents and siblings on 17 July 1918 by Bolshevik revolutionaries in Yekaterinburg, Russia, but the location of her body was unknown until 2007.

In 1920, Anderson was institutionalized in a mental hospital after a suicide attempt in Berlin. At first, she went by the name &quot;Fräulein Unbekannt&quot; (German for Miss Unknown) as she refused to reveal her identity. Later, she used the name Tschaikovsky and then Anderson. In March 1922, claims that Anderson was a Russian grand duchess received public attention. Most members of Grand Duchess Anastasia&#x27;s family and those who had known her, including court tutor Pierre Gilliard, said Anderson was an impostor but others were convinced she was Anastasia. In 1927, a private investigation funded by the Tsarina&#x27;s brother, Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse, identified Anderson as &quot;Franziska Schanzkowska&quot;, a Polish factory worker with a history of mental illness. After a lawsuit lasting many years, the German courts ruled that Anderson had failed to prove she was Anastasia, but through media coverage, her claim gained notoriety.

Between 1920 and 1968, Anderson lived in Germany and the United States with various supporters and in nursing homes and sanatoria, including at least one asylum. She emigrated to the United States in 1968. Shortly before the expiration of her visa she married history professor Jack Manahan, who was later characterized as &quot;probably Charlottesville&#x27;s best-loved eccentric&quot;. Upon her death in 1984, Anderson&#x27;s body was cremated, and her ashes were buried in the churchyard at Castle Seeon, Germany.

After the collapse of communism in the Soviet Union, the locations of the bodies of the Tsar, Tsarina, and all five of their children were revealed. Multiple laboratories in different countries confirmed their identity through DNA testing. DNA tests on a lock of Anderson&#x27;s hair and surviving medical samples of her tissue showed that her DNA did not match that of the Romanov remains or that of living relatives of the Romanovs. Instead, Anderson&#x27;s mitochondrial DNA matched that of Karl Maucher, a great-nephew of Franziska Schanzkowska. Most scientists, historians and journalists who have discussed the case accept that Anderson and Schanzkowska were the same person.

==Dalldorf asylum (1920–1922)==
On 27 February 1920, a young woman attempted to commit suicide in Berlin by jumping off the Bendlerstrasse bridge into the Landwehrkanal. She was rescued by a police sergeant and was admitted to the Elisabeth Hospital on Lützowstrasse. As she was without papers and refused to identify herself, she was admitted as &quot;Fräulein Unbekannt&quot; (&quot;Miss Unknown&quot;) to a mental hospital in Dalldorf (now Wittenau, in Reinickendorf), where she remained for the next two years. The unknown patient had scars on her head and body and spoke German with an accent described as &quot;Russian&quot; by medical staff.

In early 1922, Clara Peuthert, a fellow psychiatric patient, claimed that the unknown woman was Grand Duchess Tatiana of Russia, one of the four daughters of Tsar Nicholas II. On her release, Peuthert told Russian émigré Captain Nicholas von Schwabe that she had seen Tatiana at Dalldorf. Schwabe visited the asylum and accepted the woman as Tatiana. Schwabe persuaded other émigrés to visit the unknown woman, including Zinaida Tolstoy, a friend of Tsarina Alexandra. Eventually Baroness Sophie Buxhoeveden, a former lady-in-waiting to the Tsarina, visited the asylum with Tolstoy. On seeing the woman, Buxhoeveden declared &quot;She&#x27;s too short for Tatiana,&quot; and left convinced the woman was not a Russian grand duchess. A few days later, the unknown woman noted, &quot;I did not say I was Tatiana.&quot;

A nurse at Dalldorf, Thea Malinovsky, claimed years after the patient&#x27;s release from the asylum that the woman had told her she was another daughter of the Tsar, Anastasia, in the autumn of 1921. However, the patient herself could not recall the incident. Her biographers either ignore Malinovsky&#x27;s claim, or weave it into their narrative.

==Germany and Switzerland (1922–1927)==
By May 1922, the woman was believed by Peuthert, Schwabe, and Tolstoy to be Anastasia, although Buxhoeveden said there was no resemblance. Nevertheless, the woman was taken out of the asylum and given a room in the Berlin home of Baron Arthur von Kleist, a Russian émigré who had been a police chief in Russian Poland before the fall of the Tsar. The Berlin policeman who handled the case, Detective Inspector Franz Grünberg, thought that Kleist &quot;may have had ulterior motives, as was hinted at in émigré circles: if the old conditions should ever be restored in Russia, he hoped for great advancement from having looked after the young woman.&quot;

She began calling herself Anna Tschaikovsky, choosing &quot;Anna&quot; as a short form of &quot;Anastasia&quot;, although Peuthert &quot;described her everywhere as Anastasia&quot;. Tschaikovsky stayed in the houses of acquaintances, including Kleist, Peuthert, a poor working-class family called Bachmann, and at Inspector Grünberg&#x27;s estate at Funkenmühle, near Zossen. At Funkenmühle, Grünberg arranged for the Tsarina&#x27;s sister, Princess Irene of Hesse and by Rhine, to meet Tschaikovsky, but Irene did not recognize her. Grünberg also arranged a visit from Crown Princess Cecilie of Prussia, but Tschaikovsky refused to speak to her, and Cecilie was left perplexed by the encounter. Later, in the 1950s, Cecilie signed a declaration that Tschaikovsky was Anastasia, but Cecilie&#x27;s family disputed her statement and implied that she had dementia.

By 1925, Tschaikovsky had developed a tuberculous infection of her arm, and she was placed in a succession of hospitals for treatment. Sick and near death, she lost significant weight. She was visited by the Tsarina&#x27;s groom of the chamber Alexei Volkov; Anastasia&#x27;s tutor Pierre Gilliard; his wife, Alexandra Tegleva, who had been Anastasia&#x27;s nursemaid; and the Tsar&#x27;s sister, Grand Duchess Olga. Although they expressed sympathy, if only for Tschaikovsky&#x27;s illness, and made no immediate public declarations, eventually they all denied she was Anastasia. In March 1926, she convalesced in Lugano with Harriet von Rathlef at the expense of Grand Duchess Anastasia&#x27;s great-uncle, Prince Valdemar of Denmark. Valdemar was willing to offer Tschaikovsky material assistance, through the Danish ambassador to Germany, Herluf Zahle, while her identity was investigated. To allow her to travel, the Berlin Aliens Office issued her with a temporary certificate of identity as &quot;Anastasia Tschaikovsky&quot;, with Grand Duchess Anastasia&#x27;s personal details. After a quarrel with Rathlef, Tschaikovsky was moved to the Stillachhaus Sanatorium at Oberstdorf in the Bavarian Alps in June 1926, and Rathlef returned to Berlin.

At Oberstdorf, Tschaikovsky was visited by Tatiana Melnik, &quot;née&quot; Botkin. Melnik was the niece of Serge Botkin, the head of the Russian refugee office in Berlin, and the daughter of the imperial family&#x27;s personal physician, Eugene Botkin, who had been murdered by the communists alongside the Tsar&#x27;s family in 1918. Tatiana Melnik had met Grand Duchess Anastasia as a child and had last spoken to her in February 1917. To Melnik, Tschaikovsky looked like Anastasia, even though &quot;the mouth has changed and coarsened noticeably, and because the face is so lean, her nose looks bigger than it was.&quot; In a letter, Melnik wrote: &quot;Her attitude is childlike, and altogether she cannot be reckoned with as a responsible adult, but must be led and directed like a child. She has not only forgotten languages, but has in general lost the power of accurate narration ... even the simplest stories she tells incoherently and incorrectly; they are really only words strung together in impossibly ungrammatical German ... Her defect is obviously in her memory and eyesight.&quot; Melnik declared that Tschaikovsky was Anastasia, and supposed that any inability on her part to remember events and her refusal to speak Russian was caused by her impaired physical and psychological state. Either inadvertently through a sincere desire to &quot;aid the patient&#x27;s weak memory&quot;, or as part of a deliberate charade, Melnik coached Tschaikovsky with details of life in the imperial family.

==Castle Seeon (1927)==
In 1927, under pressure from his family, Valdemar decided against providing Tschaikovsky with any further financial support, and the funds from Denmark were cut off. Duke George of Leuchtenberg, a distant relative of the Tsar, gave her a home at Castle Seeon. The Tsarina&#x27;s brother, Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse, hired a private detective, Martin Knopf, to investigate the claims that Tschaikovsky was Anastasia.

During her stay at Castle Seeon, Knopf reported that Tschaikovsky was actually a Polish factory worker called Franziska Schanzkowska. Schanzkowska had worked in a munitions factory during World War I when, shortly after her fiancé had been killed at the front, a grenade fell out of her hand and exploded. She had been injured in the head, and a foreman was killed in front of her. She became apathetic and depressed, was declared insane on 19 September 1916, and spent time in two lunatic asylums. In early 1920, she was reported missing from her Berlin lodgings, and since then had not been seen or heard from by her family. In May 1927, Franziska&#x27;s brother Felix Schanzkowski was introduced to Tschaikovsky at a local inn in Wasserburg near Castle Seeon. Leuchtenberg&#x27;s son, Dmitri, was completely certain that Tschaikovsky was an impostor and that she was recognized by Felix as his sister, but Leuchtenberg&#x27;s daughter, Natalie, remained convinced of Tschaikovsky&#x27;s authenticity. Leuchtenberg himself was ambivalent. According to one account, initially Felix declared that Tschaikovsky was his sister Franziska, but the affidavit he signed spoke only of a &quot;strong resemblance&quot;, highlighted physical differences, and said she did not recognize him. Years later, Felix&#x27;s family said that he knew Tschaikovsky was his sister, but he had chosen to leave her to her new life, which was far more comfortable than any alternative.

Visitors to Seeon included Prince Felix Yusupov, husband of Anastasia&#x27;s paternal cousin Princess Irina Alexandrovna of Russia, who wrote, Other visitors, however, such as Felix Dassel, an officer whom Anastasia had visited in hospital during 1916, and Gleb Botkin, who had known Anastasia as a child and was Tatiana Melnik&#x27;s brother, were convinced that Tschaikovsky was genuine.

==United States (1928–1931)==
By 1928, Tschaikovsky&#x27;s claim had received interest and attention in the United States, where Gleb Botkin had published articles in support of her cause. Botkin&#x27;s publicity caught the attention of a distant cousin of Anastasia&#x27;s, Xenia Leeds, a former Russian princess who had married a wealthy American industrialist. Botkin and Leeds arranged for Tschaikovsky to travel to the United States on board the liner at Leeds&#x27;s expense. On the journey from Seeon to the States, Tschaikovsky stopped at Paris, where she met Grand Duke Andrei Vladimirovich of Russia, the Tsar&#x27;s cousin, who believed her to be Anastasia. For six months Tschaikovsky lived at the estate of the Leeds family in Oyster Bay, New York.

As the tenth anniversary of the Tsar&#x27;s execution approached in July 1928, Botkin retained a lawyer, Edward Fallows, to oversee legal moves to obtain any of the Tsar&#x27;s estate outside of the Soviet Union. As the death of the Tsar had never been proved, the estate could only be released to relatives ten years after the supposed date of his death. Fallows set up a company, called the Grandanor Corporation (an acronym of Grand Duchess Anastasia of Russia), which sought to raise funds by selling shares in any prospective estate. Tschaikovsky claimed that the Tsar had deposited money abroad, which fed unsubstantiated rumors of a large Romanov fortune in England. The surviving relatives of the Romanovs accused Botkin and Fallows of fortune hunting, and Botkin accused them of trying to defraud &quot;Anastasia&quot; out of her inheritance. Except for a relatively small deposit in Germany, distributed to the Tsar&#x27;s recognized relations, no money was ever found. After a quarrel, possibly over Tschaikovsky&#x27;s claim to the estate (but not over her claim to be Anastasia), Tschaikovsky moved out of the Leeds&#x27; mansion, and the pianist Sergei Rachmaninoff arranged for her to live at the Garden City Hotel in Hempstead, New York, and later in a small cottage. To avoid the press, she was booked in as Mrs. Anderson, the name by which she was subsequently known. In October 1928, after the death of the Tsar&#x27;s mother, the Dowager Empress Marie, the 12 nearest relations of the Tsar met at Marie&#x27;s funeral and signed a declaration that denounced Anderson as an impostor. The Copenhagen Statement, as it would come to be known, explained: &quot;Our sense of duty compels us to state that the story is only a fairy tale. The memory of our dear departed would be tarnished if we allowed this fantastic story to spread and gain any credence.&quot; Gleb Botkin answered with a public letter to Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia, which referred to the family as &quot;greedy and unscrupulous&quot; and claimed they were only denouncing Anderson for money.

From early 1929 Anderson lived with Annie Burr Jennings, a wealthy Park Avenue spinster happy to host someone she supposed to be a daughter of the Tsar. For eighteen months, Anderson was the toast of New York City society. Then a pattern of self-destructive behavior began that culminated in her throwing tantrums, killing her pet parakeet, and on one occasion running around naked on the roof. On 24 July 1930, Judge Peter Schmuck of the New York Supreme Court signed an order committing her to a mental hospital. Before she could be taken away, Anderson locked herself in her room, and the door was broken in with an axe. She was forcibly taken to the Four Winds Sanatorium in Westchester County, New York, where she remained for slightly over a year. In August 1931, Anderson returned to Germany accompanied by a private nurse in a locked cabin on the liner &quot;Deutschland&quot;. Jennings paid for the voyage, the stay at the Westchester sanatorium, and an additional six months&#x27; care in the psychiatric wing of a nursing home at Ilten near Hanover. On arrival at Ilten, Anderson was assessed as sane, but as the room was prepaid, and she had nowhere else to go, she stayed on in a suite in the sanatorium grounds.

==Germany (1931–1968)==
Anderson&#x27;s return to Germany generated press interest, and drew more members of the German aristocracy to her cause. She again lived itinerantly as a guest of her well-wishers. In 1932, the British tabloid &quot;News of the World&quot; published a sensational story accusing her of being a Romanian actress who was perpetrating a fraud. Her lawyer, Fallows, filed suit for libel, but the lengthy case continued until the outbreak of World War II, at which time the case was dismissed because Anderson was living in Germany, and German residents could not sue in enemy countries. From 1938, lawyers acting for Anderson in Germany contested the distribution of the Tsar&#x27;s estate to his recognized relations, and they in turn contested her identity. The litigation continued intermittently without resolution for decades; Lord Mountbatten footed some of his German relations&#x27; legal bills against Anderson. The protracted proceedings became the longest-running lawsuit in German history.

Anderson had a final meeting with the Schanzkowski family in 1938. Gertrude Schanzkowska was insistent that Anderson was her sister, Franziska, but the Nazi government had arranged the meeting to determine Anderson&#x27;s identity, and if accepted as Schanzkowska she would be imprisoned. The Schanzkowski family refused to sign affidavits against her, and no further action was taken. In 1940, Edward Fallows died virtually destitute after wasting all his own money on trying to obtain the Tsar&#x27;s nonexistent fortune for the Grandanor Corporation. Toward the end of World War II, Anderson lived at Schloss Winterstein with Louise of Saxe-Meiningen, in what became the Soviet occupation zone. In 1946, Prince Frederick of Saxe-Altenburg helped her across the border to Bad Liebenzell in the French occupation zone.

Prince Frederick settled Anderson in a former army barracks in the small village of Unterlengenhardt, on the edge of the Black Forest, where she became a sort of tourist attraction. Lili Dehn, a friend of Tsarina Alexandra, visited her and acknowledged her as Anastasia, but when Charles Sydney Gibbes, English tutor to the imperial children, met Anderson, he denounced her as a fraud. In an affidavit, he swore, &quot;She in no way resembles the true Grand Duchess Anastasia that I had known ... I am quite satisfied that she is an impostor.&quot; She became a recluse, surrounded by cats, and her house began to decay. In May 1968, Anderson was taken to a hospital at Neuenbürg after being discovered semi-conscious in her cottage. In her absence, Prince Frederick cleaned up the property by order of the local board of health. Her Irish Wolfhound and 60 cats were put to death. Horrified by this, Anderson accepted her long-term supporter Gleb Botkin&#x27;s offer to move back to the United States.

==Final years (1968–1984)==
Botkin was living in the university town of Charlottesville, Virginia, and a local friend of his, history professor and genealogist John Eacott &quot;Jack&quot; Manahan, paid for Anderson&#x27;s journey to the United States. She entered the country on a six-month visitor&#x27;s visa, and shortly before it was due to expire, Anderson married Manahan, who was 20 years her junior, in a civil ceremony on 23 December 1968. Botkin was best man. Jack Manahan enjoyed this marriage of convenience, and described himself as &quot;Grand Duke-in-Waiting&quot; or &quot;son-in-law to the Tsar&quot;. The couple lived in separate bedrooms in a house on University Circle in Charlottesville, and also owned a farm near Scottsville. Botkin died in December 1969. In February of the following year, 1970, the lawsuits finally came to an end, with neither side able to establish Anderson&#x27;s identity.

Manahan and Anderson, now legally called Anastasia Manahan, became well known in the Charlottesville area as eccentrics. Though Jack Manahan was wealthy, they lived in squalor with large numbers of dogs and cats, and piles of garbage. On 20 August 1979, Anderson was taken to Charlottesville&#x27;s Martha Jefferson Hospital with an intestinal obstruction. A gangrenous tumor and a length of intestine were removed by Dr. Richard Shrum.

With both Manahan and Anderson in failing health, in November 1983, Anderson was institutionalized, and an attorney, William Preston, was appointed as her guardian by the local circuit court. A few days later, Manahan &quot;kidnapped&quot; Anderson from the hospital, and for three days they drove around Virginia eating out of convenience stores. After a 13-state police alarm, they were found and Anderson was returned to a care facility. In January she was thought to have had a stroke, and on 12 February 1984, she died of pneumonia. She was cremated the same day, and her ashes were buried in the churchyard at Castle Seeon on 18 June 1984. Manahan died on 22 March 1990.

==DNA evidence==
In 1991, the bodies of Tsar Nicholas II, Tsarina Alexandra, and three of their daughters were exhumed from a mass grave near Yekaterinburg. They were identified on the basis of both skeletal analysis and DNA testing. For example, mitochondrial DNA was used to match maternal relations, and mitochondrial DNA from the female bones matched that of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, whose maternal grandmother Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine was a sister of Alexandra. The bodies of Tsarevich Alexei and the remaining daughter were discovered in 2007. Repeated and independent DNA tests confirmed that the remains were the seven members of the Romanov family, and proved that none of the Tsar&#x27;s four daughters survived the shooting of the Romanov family.

A sample of Anderson&#x27;s tissue, part of her intestine removed during an operation in 1979, had been stored at Martha Jefferson Hospital, Charlottesville, Virginia. Anderson&#x27;s mitochondrial DNA was extracted from the sample and compared with that of the Romanovs and their relatives. It did not match that of the Duke of Edinburgh or that of the bones, confirming that Anderson was not related to the Romanovs. However, the sample matched DNA provided by Karl Maucher, a grandson of Franziska Schanzkowska&#x27;s sister, Gertrude (Schanzkowska) Ellerik, indicating that Karl Maucher and Anna Anderson were maternally related and that Anderson was Schanzkowska. Five years after the original testing was done, Dr. Terry Melton of the Department of Anthropology, Pennsylvania State University, stated that the DNA sequence tying Anderson to the Schanzkowski family was &quot;still unique&quot;, though the database of DNA patterns at the Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory had grown much larger, leading to &quot;increased confidence that Anderson was indeed Franziska Schanzkowska&quot;.

Similarly, several strands of Anderson&#x27;s hair, found inside an envelope in a book that had belonged to Anderson&#x27;s husband, Jack Manahan, were also tested. Mitochondrial DNA from the hair matched Anderson&#x27;s hospital sample and that of Schanzkowska&#x27;s relative Karl Maucher, but not the Romanov remains or living relatives of the Romanovs.

==Assessment==
Although communists had murdered the entire imperial Romanov family in July 1918, including 17-year-old Grand Duchess Anastasia, for years afterwards communist disinformation fed rumors that members of the Tsar&#x27;s family had survived. The conflicting rumors about the fate of the family allowed impostors to make spurious claims that they were a surviving Romanov.

Most of the impostors were dismissed, but Anna Anderson&#x27;s claim persisted. Books and pamphlets supporting her claims included Harriet von Rathlef&#x27;s book &quot;Anastasia, ein Frauenschicksal als Spiegel der Weltkatastrophe&quot; (&quot;Anastasia, a Woman&#x27;s Fate as Mirror of the World Catastrophe&quot;), published in Germany and Switzerland in 1928 after being serialized by the tabloid newspaper &quot;Berliner Nachtausgabe&quot; in 1927. This was countered by works such as &quot;La Fausse Anastasie&quot; (&quot;The False Anastasia&quot;) by Pierre Gilliard and Constantin Savitch, published by Payot of Paris in 1929. Conflicting testimonies and physical evidence, such as comparisons of facial characteristics, which alternately supported and contradicted Anderson&#x27;s claim, were used either to bolster or counter the belief that she was Anastasia. In the absence of any direct documentary proof or solid physical evidence, the question of whether she was Anastasia was for many a matter of personal belief. As Anderson herself said, &quot;You either believe it or you don&#x27;t believe it. It doesn&#x27;t matter. In no anyway whatsoever.&quot; The German courts were unable to decide her claim, and after 40 years of deliberation, ruled that it was &quot;neither established nor refuted&quot;. Günter von Berenberg-Gossler, attorney for Anderson&#x27;s opponents in the later years of the legal case, said that during the German trials &quot;the press were always more interested in reporting her side of the story than the opposing bench&#x27;s less glamorous perspective; editors often pulled journalists after reporting testimony delivered by her side and ignored the rebuttal, resulting in the public seldom getting a complete picture.&quot;

In 1957, a version of Anderson&#x27;s story, pieced together by her supporters and interspersed with commentary by Roland Krug von Nidda, was published in Germany under the title &quot;Ich, Anastasia, Erzähle&quot; (&quot;I, Anastasia, an autobiography&quot;). The book included the &quot;fantastic tale&quot; that Anastasia escaped from Russia on a farm cart with a man called Alexander Tschaikovsky, whom she married and had a child by, before he was shot dead on a Bucharest street, and that the child, Alexei, disappeared into an orphanage. Even Anderson&#x27;s supporters admitted that the details of the supposed escape &quot;might seem bold inventions even for a dramatist&quot;, while her detractors considered &quot;this barely credible story as a piece of far-fetched romance&quot;. Other works based on the premise that Anderson was Anastasia, written before the DNA tests, include biographies by Peter Kurth and James Blair Lovell. More recent biographies by John Klier, Robert Massie, and Greg King that describe her as an impostor were written after the DNA tests proved she was not Anastasia.

Assessments vary as to whether Anderson was a deliberate impostor, delusional, traumatized into adopting a new identity, or someone used by her supporters for their own ends. Pierre Gilliard called her &quot;a cunning psychopath&quot;. The equation of Anderson with members of the imperial family began with Clara Peuthert in the Dalldorf Asylum, not with Anderson herself. Anderson appeared to go along with it afterward. Writer Michael Thornton thought, &quot;Somewhere along the way she lost and rejected Schanzkowska. She lost that person totally and accepted completely she was this new person. I think it happened by accident and she was swept along on a wave of euphoria.&quot; Lord Mountbatten, a first cousin of the Romanov children, thought her supporters &quot;simply get rich on the royalties of further books, magazine articles, plays etc.&quot; Prince Michael Romanov, a grandson of Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia, said the Romanov family always knew Anderson was a fraud and looked upon her and &quot;the three-ringed circus which danced around her, creating books and movies, as a vulgar insult to the memory of the Imperial Family.&quot;

==Fictional portrayals==
Since the 1920s, many fictional works have been inspired by Anderson&#x27;s claim to be Anastasia. In 1928, the silent film &quot;Clothes Make the Woman&quot; was based very loosely on her story. In 1953, Marcelle Maurette wrote a play based on Rathlef&#x27;s and Gilliard&#x27;s books called &quot;Anastasia&quot;, which toured Europe and America with Viveca Lindfors in the title role. The play was so successful that in 1956 an English adaptation by Guy Bolton was made into a film, &quot;Anastasia&quot;, starring Ingrid Bergman. The plot revolves around a group of swindlers who attempt to raise money among Russian émigrés by pretending that Grand Duchess Anastasia is still alive. A suitable amnesiac, &quot;Anna&quot;, is groomed by the swindlers to impersonate Anastasia. Anna&#x27;s origins are unknown and as the play progresses hints are dropped that she could be the real Anastasia, who has lost her memory. The viewer is left to decide whether Anna really is Anastasia. Another film was released at the same time, &quot;Is Anna Anderson Anastasia?&quot; starring Lilli Palmer, which covers much the same ground, but the central character is &quot;perhaps even more lost, mad and pathetic, but she, too, has moments when she is a woman of presence and dignity&quot;.

Playwright Royce Ryton wrote &quot;I Am Who I Am&quot; about Anna Anderson in 1978. Like the earlier plays, it depicts Anderson as &quot;a person of intrinsic worth victimized by the greed and fears of others&quot; and did not attempt to decide her real identity.

Sir Kenneth MacMillan&#x27;s ballet &quot;Anastasia&quot;, first performed in 1967, used &quot;I, Anastasia, an autobiography&quot; as inspiration and &quot;is a dramatic fantasy about Anna Anderson, the woman who believes herself to be Anastasia ... Either in memory or imagination, she experiences episodes from Anastasia&#x27;s past ... The structure is a kind of free-wheeling nightmare, held together by the central figure of the heroine, played by Lynn Seymour&quot;. A contemporary reviewer thought Seymour&#x27;s &quot;tense, tormented portrait of the desperate Anna Anderson is quite extraordinary and really impressive&quot;. Anna Anderson was also used as a narrative device in Youri Vámos&#x27; 1992 ballet for Theater Basel, &quot;Sleeping Beauty – Last Daughter of the Czar&quot;, based on Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;.

In 1986, a two-part fictionalized made for television mini-series titled &quot;&quot; appeared (NBC in the U.S.) which starred Amy Irving and won her a Golden Globe nomination. In the words of Hal Erickson, &quot;Irving plays the leading character in a lady-or-the-tiger fashion, so that we never know if she truly swallows her own tale or if she&#x27;s merely a clever charlatan.&quot;

The central character (&quot;Anastasia&quot; or &quot;Anya&quot;) of the 1997 animated fantasy &quot;Anastasia&quot; is portrayed as the actual Grand Duchess Anastasia, even though the film &quot;–&quot; produced and directed by Don Bluth and Gary Goldman &quot;–&quot; was released after DNA tests proved that Anna Anderson was not Anastasia. However, this may be due to the animated film&#x27;s origin as an adaptation of &quot;Anastasia (1956)&quot; that also included story elements from &quot;Pygmalion.&quot; Though initially researching the actual events, Bluth and Goldman decided the history of Anastasia and the Romanov dynasty was too dark for their film. Indeed, the historical fact of Romanov impostors and a long artistic tradition of fictionalizing the story of Grand Duchess Anastasia suggest that the directors likely never intended to reference Anna Anderson specifically. Though generally well received, some of Anastasia&#x27;s contemporary relatives felt that the film was distasteful while noting that most Romanovs have come to accept the, &quot;repeated exploitation of Anastasia&#x27;s romantic tale... with equanimity.&quot;

<doc id="238806" wikidata="Q505142" url="?curid=238806" title="Eosinophilia">
<text>Eosinophilia is a condition in which the eosinophil count in the peripheral blood exceeds . Hypereosinophilia is an elevation in an individual&#x27;s circulating blood eosinophil count above 1.5 × 109/L (i.e. 1,500/μL). The hypereosinophilic syndrome is a sustained elevation in this count above 1.5 × 109/L (i.e. 1,500/μL) that is also associated with evidence of eosinophil-based tissue injury.

Eosinophils usually account for less than 7% of the circulating leukocytes. A marked increase in non-blood tissue eosinophil count noticed upon histopathologic examination is diagnostic for tissue eosinophilia. Several causes are known, with the most common being some form of allergic reaction or parasitic infection. Diagnosis of eosinophilia is via a complete blood count (CBC), but diagnostic procedures directed at the underlying cause vary depending on the suspected condition(s). An absolute eosinophil count is not generally needed if the CBC shows marked eosinophilia. The location of the causal factor can be used to classify eosinophilia into two general types: extrinsic, in which the factor lies outside the eosinophil cell lineage; and intrinsic eosinophilia, which denotes etiologies within the eosinophil cell line. Specific treatments are dictated by the causative condition, though in idiopathic eosinophilia, the disease may be controlled with corticosteroids. Eosinophilia is not a disorder (rather, only a sign) unless it is idiopathic.

Informally, blood eosinophil levels are often regarded as mildly elevated at counts of 500–1,500/μL, moderately elevated between 1,500 and 5,000/μL, and severely elevated when greater than 5,000/μL. Elevations in blood eosinophil counts can be transient, sustained, recurrent, or cyclical.

Eosinophil counts in human blood normally range between 100 and 500 per/μL. Maintenance of these levels results from a balance between production of eosinophils by bone marrow eosinophil precursor cells termed CFU-Eos and the emigration of circulating eosinophils out of the blood through post-capillary venules into tissues. Eosinophils represent a small percentage of peripheral blood leucocytes (usually less than 8%), have a half-life in the circulation of only 8–18 hours, but persist in tissues for at least several weeks.

Eosinophils are one form of terminally differentiated granulocytes; they function to neutralize invading microbes, primarily parasites and helminthes but also certain types of fungi and viruses. They also participate in transplant rejection, Graft-versus-host disease, and the killing of tumor cells. In conducting these functions, eosinophils produce and release on demand a range of toxic reactive oxygen species (e.g. hypobromite, hypobromous acid, superoxide, and peroxide) and they also release on demand a preformed armamentarium of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, lipid mediators (e.g. leukotrienes, prostaglandins, platelet activating factor), and toxic proteins (e.g. metalloproteinases, major basic protein, eosinophil cationic protein, eosinophil peroxidase, and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin). These agents serve to orchestrate robust immune and inflammatory responses that destroy invading microbes, foreign tissue, and malignant cells. When overproduced and over-activated, which occurs in certain cases of hypereosinophilia and to a lesser extent eosinophilia, eosinophils may misdirect their reactive oxygen species and armamentarium of preformed molecules toward normal tissues. This can result in serious damage to such organs as the lung, heart, kidneys, and brain.

== Classification ==
Based on their causes, hypereosinophilias can be sorted into subtypes. However, cases of eosinophilia, which exhibit eosinophil counts between 500 and 1,500/μL, may fit the clinical criteria for, and thus be regarded as falling into, one of these hypereosinophilia categories: the cutoff of 1,500/μL between hypereosinophilia and eosinophilia is somewhat arbitrary. There are at least two different guidelines for classifying hypereosinophilia/eosinophilia into subtypes. The General Haematoloy and Haemato-oncology Task Forces for the British Committee for Standards in Haematology classifies these disorders into a) Primary, i.e. caused by abnormalities in the eosinophil cell line; b) Secondary, i.e. caused by non-eosinophil disorders; and c) Idiopathic, cause unknown. The World Health Organization classifies these disorders into a) Myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and abnormalities of &quot;PDGFRA, PDGFRB&quot;, or &quot;FGFR1&quot; (i.e. high eosinophil blood counts caused by mutations in the eosinophil cell line of one of these three genes), &#x27;b) Chronic eosinophilic leukemia, and c) the Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome. In the latter classification, secondary hypereosinophilia/eosinophilia is not viewed as a true disorder of eosinophils. Here these two classifications are merged and expanded to include the many forms of secondary, i.e. reactive hypereosinophilia/eosinophilia, disorders and also includes another subtype, organ-restricted hypereosinophilias, a disorder in which eosinophil-mediated tissue damage is restricted to one organ and is often but not always associated with increased blood eosinophil counts.

=== Primary hypereosinophilia ===
Primary hypereosinophilia is due to the development of a clone of eosinophils, i.e. a group of genetically identical eosinophils derived from a significantly mutated ancestor cell. The clone may prove to be benign, pre-malignant, or overtly malignant. The fundamental driver of these hypereosinophilic (or uncommonly eosinophilic) disorders is the mutation which increases the proliferation, survival, and further mutation of cells descendant from the originally mutated cell. There are several subtypes of primary hypereosinophilia.

==== Clonal hypereosinophilia ====

Clonal hypereosinophilia is hypereosinophilia caused by a pre-malignant or malignant clone of eosinophils that bear mutations in genes for &quot;PDGFRA&quot;, &quot;PDGFRB&quot;, or &quot;FGFR1&quot; or, alternatively, a chromosome translocation that creates the &quot;PCM1-JAK2&quot; fusion gene. These genes code for dysfunctional protein products capable of enhancing proliferation and/or survival of their parent cells which, in consequence, become an evolving and constantly growing clone of eosinophils. These mutations are recognized by the World Health Association as causing distinct entities differing from idiopathic hypereosinophilia and the idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome. Presence of these clones may be associated with tissue injury but in any case suggests specific therapy be directed at reducing the size and suppressing the growth of the eosinophil clone. More recently, mutations in other genes have been described as causing a similar type of clonal hypereosinophilia but have not yet been recognized as entities distinct from idiopathic hypereosinophilia and the idiopathic hyperesoniphilic syndrome. These include gene mutations in &quot;JAK2&quot;, &quot;ABL1&quot;, and &quot;FLT2&quot; and chromosomal translocations that create the &quot;ETV6-ACSL6&quot; fusion gene.

==== Chronic eosinophilic leukemia (NOS) ====

Chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified (i.e. CEL, NOS), is a leukemia-inducing disorder in the eosinophil cell lineage that causes eosinophil blood counts greater than 1,500/μL. The most recent (2017) World health organization criteria specifically excludes from this disorder hypereosinophilia/eosinophilia associated with &quot;BCR-ABL1&quot; fusion gene-positive chronic myeloid leukemia, polycythemia vera, essential thrombocytosis, primary myelofibrosis, chronic neutrophilic leukemia, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, atypical chronic myelogenous leukemia, clonal eosinophilias involving gene rearrangements of &quot;PDGFRA&quot;, &quot;PDGFRB&quot;, or &quot;FGFR1&quot;, and chromosome translocations that form &quot;PCM1-JAK2&quot;, &quot;ETV6-JAK2&quot;, or &quot;BCR-JAK2&quot; fusion genes. For this diagnosis, immature eosinophil (e.g. myeloblast) cell counts in the bone marrow and peripheral blood must be less than 20% and the chromosomal alterations (inv(16)(p13.1q22)) and t(16;16)(p13;q22) as well as other features diagnostic of acute myelogenous leukemia must be absent. The latter diagnostic features include clonal cytogenetic abnormalities and molecular genetic abnormalities diagnostic for other forms of leukemia or the presence of myeloblast counts greater than 55% in bone marrow or 2% in blood. Chronic eosinophilic leukemia may transform into acute eosinophilic or other types of acute myelogenous leukemia.

==== Familial eosinophilia ====

Familial eosinophilia is a rare congenital disorder characterized by the presence of sustained elevations in blood eosinophil levels that reach ranges diagnostic of eosinophilia or, far more commonly, hypereosinophilia. It is an autosomal dominant disorder in which genetic linkage gene mapping family studies localize the gene responsible for it to chromosome 5 at position q31–q33, between markers D5S642 and D5S816. This region contains a cytokine gene cluster which includes three genes whose protein products function in regulating the development and proliferation of eosinophils viz., interleukin 3, interleukin 5, and colony stimulating factor 2. However, no functional sequence genetic polymorphisms are found within the promoter, exons, or introns, of these genes or within the common gene enhancer for interleukin 3 or colony stimulating factor 2. This suggests that the primary defect in familial eosinophilia is not a mutation in one of these genes but rather in another gene within this chromosome area. Clinical manifestations and tissue destruction related to the eosinophilia in this disorder are uncommon: familial eosinophilia typically has a benign phenotype compared to other congenital and acquired eosinophilic diseases.

==== Idiopathic hypereosinophilia ====
Idiopathic hypereosinophilia (also termed hypereosinophilia of undetermined significance, i.e. HEUS) is a disorder characterized by an increase in eosinophil blood counts above 1,500/μL, as detected on at least 2 separate examinations. The disorder cannot be associated with eosinophil-based tissue damage or a primary or secondary cause of eosinophilia. That is, it is a diagnosis of exclusion and has no known cause. Over time, this disorder can resolve into a primary hypereosinophilia, typically clonal hypereosinophilia, chronic eosinphilic leukemia, or an eosinophilia associated with another hematological leukemia. The disorder may also become associated with tissue or organ damage and therefore be diagnosed as the hypereosinophilic syndrome. Idiopathic hypereosinophilia is treated by observation to detect development of the cited more serious disorders.

==== Idiopathic hypereosiophilic syndrome ====

The idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome is a disorder characterized by hypereosiophilia that is associated with eosinophil-based tissue or organ damage. While almost any organ or tissue may be damaged, the lung, skin, heart, blood vessels, sinuses, kidneys, and brain are the most commonly affected. The World Health Organization restrict this diagnosis to cases which have no well-defined cause. That is, all cases of secondary (i.e. reactive) eosinophilia (including lymphocyte-variant hypereosinophilia) and primary hypereosinophilia (including chronic eosinophilic leukemia (NOS), clonal eosinophilia, and hypereosinophilia associated with hematological malignancies) are excluded from this diagnosis.

=== Secondary hypereosinophilia ===
Secondary (or reactive) eosinophilias are non-clonal increases in blood eosinophil levels caused by an underlying disease. The pathogenesis of the hypereosinophilia in these diseases is thought to be the release of one or more cytokines (e.g. granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor, interleukin 3, interleukin 5) that: a) cause bone marrow precursor cells, i.e. CFU-Eos, to proliferate and mature into eosinophils; b) promote release of bone marrow eosinophils into the circulation, c) stimulate circulating eosinophils to enter tissues and release tissue-injuring agents. These cytokines may be released by the diseased cells or the diseased cells may cause the release of these cytokines by non-diseased cells. Primary disorders associated with and known or presumed to cause hypereosinophilia or eosinophilia are given below.

==== Infections ====
Helminths are common causes of hypereosinophilia and eosinophilia in areas endemic to these parasites. Helminths infections causing increased blood eosinophil counts include: 1) nematodes, (e.g. &quot;Angiostrongylus cantonensis&quot; and Hookworm infections), ascariasis, strongyloidiasis trichinosis, visceral larva migrans, Gnathostomiasis, cysticercosis, and echinococcosis; 2) filarioidea, e.g. tropical pulmonary eosinophilia, loiasis, and onchocerciasis; and 3) flukes, e.g. schistosomiasis, fascioliasis, clonorchiasis, paragonimiasis, and fasciolopsiasis. Other infections associated with increased eosinophil blood counts include: protozoan infections, e.g. &quot;Isospora belli&quot; and &quot;Dientamoeba fragilis&quot;) and sarcocystis); fungal infections (e.g. disseminated histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis [especially in cases with central nervous system involvement]), and coccidioides); and viral infections, e.g. Human T-lymphotropic virus 1 and HIV.

==== Autoimmune diseases ====
Hypereosiophilia or eosinophilia may be associated with the following autoimmune diseases: systemic lupus erythematosus eosinophilic fasciitis, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, dermatomyositis, severe rheumatoid arthritis, progressive systemic sclerosis, Sjögren syndrome, thromboangiitis obliterans, Behçet&#x27;s disease, IgG4-related disease, inflammatory bowel diseases, sarcoidosis, bullous pemphigoid, and dermatitis herpetiformis.

==== Allergic diseases ====
Eosinophilia and comparatively fewer cases of hypereosinophilia are associated with the following known diseases that are known or thought to have an allergic basis: allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopic dermatitis, eosinophilic esophagitis, chronic sinusitis, aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, and Kimura&#x27;s disease.

Certain types of food allergy disorders may also be associated with eosinophilia or, less commonly, hypereosinophilia. Allergic eosinophilic esophagitis and the food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome are commonly associated with increased blood eosinophil levels.

==== Drugs ====
A wide range of drugs are known to cause hypereosinophilia or eosinophilia accompanied by an array of allergic symptoms. Rarely, these reactions are severe causing, for example, the drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome. Drug- induced hepatitis marked by immunoallergic pathology, which has much bidirectional crossover with DRESS syndrome, is typically accompanied by some severity of eosinophilia. While virtually any drug should be considered as a possible cause of these signs and symptoms, the following drugs and drug classes are some of the most frequently reported causes: penicillins, cephalosporins, dapsone, sulfonamides, carbamazepine, phenytoin, lamotrigine, valproic acid, nevirapine, efavirenz, and ibuprofen. These drugs may cause severely toxic reactions such as the DRESS syndrome. Other drugs and drug classes often reported to cause increased blood eosinophil levels accompanied by less severe (e.g. non-DRESS syndrome) symptoms include tetracyclins, doxycycline, linezolid, nitrofurantoin, metronidazole, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, lamotrigine, valproate, desipramine, amitriptyline, fluoxetine, piroxicam, diclofenac, ACE inhibitors, abacavir, nevirapine, ranitidine, cyclosporin, and hydrochlorothiazide.

The toxic oil syndrome is associated with hypereosinophilia/eosinophilia and systemic symptoms due to one or more contaminants in rapeseed oil and the eosinophilia–myalgia syndrome, also associated with hypereosinophilia, appears due to trace contaminants in certain commercial batches of the amino acid, L-tryptophan.

Allergic reactions to drugs are a common cause of eosinophilia, with manifestations ranging from diffuse maculopapular rash, to severe life-threatening drug reactions with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). Drugs that has, allopurinol, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), some antipsychotics such as risperidone, and certain antibiotics. Phenibut, an analogue of the neurotransmitter GABA, has also been implicated in high doses. The reaction which has been shown to be T-cell mediated may also cause eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome.

==== Malignancies ====
Certain malignancies cause a secondary eosinophilia or, less commonly, hypereosinophilia. These increases in blood eosinophils appear due to the release of stimulatory cytokines or invasion of the bone marrow and thereby irritation of resident eosinophils or their precursors. Malignancies associated with these effects include gastric, colorectal, lung, bladder, and thyroid cancers, as well as squamous cell cancers of the cervix, vagina, penis, skin, and nasopharyrnx. Some hematological malignancies are likewise associated with secondary rises in blood eosinophil counts; these include Hodgkin disease, certain T-cell lymphomas, acute myeloid leukemia, the myelodysplastic syndromes, many cases of systemic mastocytosis, chronic myeloid leukemia, polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, myelofibrosis, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and certain cases of T-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma-associated or myelodysplastic–myeloproliferative syndrome-associated eosinophilias.

Hodgkin lymphoma (Hodgkin&#x27;s disease) often elicits severe eosinophilia; however, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and leukemia produce less marked eosinophilia. Of solid tumor neoplasms, ovarian cancer is most likely to provoke eosinophilia, though any other cancer can cause the condition. Solid epithelial cell tumors have been shown to cause both tissue and blood eosinophilia, with some reports indicating that this may be mediated by interleukin production by tumor cells, especially IL-5 or IL-3. This has also been shown to occur in Hodgkin lymphoma, in the form of IL-5 secreted by Reed-Sternberg cells. In primary cutaneous T cell lymphoma, blood and dermal eosinophilia are often seen. Lymphoma cells have also been shown to produce IL-5 in these disorders. Other types of lymphoid malignancies have been associated with eosinophilia, as in lymphoblastic leukemia with a translocation between chromosomes 5 and 14 or alterations in the genes which encode platelet-derived growth factor receptors alpha or beta. Patients displaying eosinophilia overexpress a gene encoding an eosinophil hematopoietin. A translocation between chromosomes 5 and 14 in patients with acute B lymphocytic leukemia resulted in the juxtaposition of the IL-3 gene and the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene, causing overproduction production of IL-3, leading to blood and tissue eosinophilia.

==== Primary immunodeficiency diseases ====

Primary immunodeficiency diseases are inborn errors in the immune system due to defective genes. Certain of these disorders are sometimes or often associated with hypereosinophilia. The list of such disorders includes ZAP70 deficiency (defective &quot;ZAP70&quot; gene), CD3gamma chain deficiency (defective &quot;CD3G&quot; gene), MCHII deficiency (defective &quot;RFXANK&quot; gene), Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome (defective &quot;WAS&quot; gene), IPEX syndrome (defective &quot;IPEX&quot; gene), &quot;CD40&quot; gene defect, and autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (defective &quot;Fas receptor&quot; gene). More than 30 other primary immunodeficiency diseases are sometimes associated with modest increases in eosinophil counts, i.e. eosinophilia. The hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome is associated with hypereosinophilia or eosinophilia due to mutations in any one of the following genes: &quot;STAT3, DOCK8, PGM3, SPINK5&quot;, and &quot;TYK2&quot; (see mutations in the hymperimmoglobulin E syndrome). Omenn syndrome is a severe combined immunodeficiency disease characterized by skin rash, slenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy due to a causative mutation in &quot;RAG1, RAG2&quot;, or, more rarely, one of several other genes.

==== Lymphocyte-variant hypereosinophilia ====

Lymphocyte-variant hypereosinophilia is a disorder attributed to the expansion of a cytokine-producing, aberrant population of a particular T-cell phenotype. The disorder is clonal with regard to the
production of abnormal T-cell lymphocytes not eosinophils which appear phenotypically normal. The phenotypically aberrant lymphocytes function abnormally by stimulating the proliferation and maturation of bone marrow eosinophil-precursor cells which in studied cases appears due to their excess production of interleukin 5, interleukin 3, or interleukin 13. The disorder is usually indolent but infrequently progresses to T-cell lymphoma or Sezary syndrome. Accumulation of partial deletions in the short arm of chromosome 6, the long arm of chromosome 10, or the acquirement of an extra chromosome (i.e. trisomy) 7) in T-cells or the proliferation of lymphocytes with the CD3 negative, CD41 positive immunophenotype may occur during the disorders progression to lymphoma. Reports on treatment of the disorder are rare. In on study of 16 lymphocyte-variant hypereosinophilia patients with the aberrant CD3 negative, CD41 positive immunophenotype, good responds to corticosteroid drugs were uniform but 16 ultimately required corticosteroid-sparing agents. Hydroxyurea and imatinib are less likely to have efficacy in this variant of hypereosinophilia than in many cases of clonal eosinophilia or chronic eosinophilic leukemia.

==== Gleich&#x27;s syndrome ====

Gleich&#x27;s syndrome, which may be a form of lymphocyte-variant hypereosinophilia, involves hypereosinophilia, elevated blood levels of IgM antibodies, and clonal expansion of T cells. Similar to lymphocyte-variant hypereosinophilia, the increased levels of blood eosinophils in Gleich&#x27;s syndrome is thought to be secondary to the secretion of eosinophil-stimulating cytokines by a T cell clones.

==== IgG4-related disease ====

IgG4-related disease or Immunoglobulin G4-related disease is a condition dacryoadenitis, sialadenitis, lymphadentitis, and pancreatitis (i.e. inflammation of the lacrimal glands, salivary glands, lymph nodes, and pancreas, respectively) plus retroperitoneal fibrosis. Less commonly, almost any other organ or tissue except joints and brain may be beleaguered by the inflammatory disorder. About 1/3 of cases exhibit eosinophilia or, rarely, hypereosinophilia. This increase in blood eosinophil count is often associated with abnormal T-lymphocyte clones (e.g. increased numbers of CD4 negative, CD7 positive T cells, CD3 negative, CD4 positive T cells, or CD3 positive, CD4 negative, CD8 negative T cells) and is thought to be secondary to these immunological disturbances. The disorder often exhibits are recurrent-relapsing course and is highly responsive to corticosteroids or rituximab as first-line therapy and interferon gamma as second-line therapy.

==== Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia ====

Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia is a disorder initially classified as a form of IgG4-related diseases but now considered a distinct entity. The disorder involves inflamed benign tumors of the vasculature in skin and, less commonly, other tissues. The tumors consist of histiocytoid endothelial cells prominently infiltrated by lymphocytes and eosinophils and is associated with hypereosinophilia or eosinophilia.

==== Cholesterol embolism ====

Transient, fluctuating hypereosinophilia occurs in 60–80% of individuals with cholesterol embolisms. In this disorder, cholesterol crystals located in an atherosclerotic plaque of a large artery dislodge, travel downstream in the blood, and clog smaller arteries. This results in obstructive damage to multiple organs and tissues. Affected tissues exhibit acute inflammation involving eosinophils, neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. The cause for this hypereosinophilic response is not known.

==== Adrenal insufficiency ====
A class of steroid hormones secreted by the adrenal gland, glucocorticoids, inhibit eosinophil proliferation and survival. In adrenal insufficiency, low levels of these hormones allow increased eosinophil proliferation and survival. This leads to increases in blood eosinophil levels, typically eosinophilia and, less commonly, hypereosinophilia.

=== Organ-restricted hypereosinophilias ===
Hypereosinophilia may occur in the setting of damage to a single specific organ due to a massive infiltration by eosinophils. This disorder is sub-classified based on the organ involved and is not considered to be a form of primary hypereosinophilia, secondary hypereosinophilia, or the idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome because: a) the eosinophils associated with the disorder have not been shown to be clonal in nature; b) a reason for the increase in blood eosinophils has not been determined; c) organ damage has not been shown to be due to eosinophils; and d) the disorder in each individual case typically is limited to the affected organ. Examples of organ-restricted hypereosinophilia include eosinophilic myocarditis, eosinophilic esophagitis, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, eosinophilic cystitis, eosinophilic pneumonia, eosinophilic fasciitis, eosinophilic folliculitis, eosinophilic cellulitis, eosinophilic vasculitis, and eosinophilic ulcer of the oral mucosa. Other examples of organ-restricted hepereosinophilia include those involving the heart, kidney, liver, colon, pulmonary pleurae, peritoneum, fat tissue, myometrium, and synovia.

==Pathophysiology==
IgE-mediated eosinophil production is induced by compounds released by basophils and mast cells, including eosinophil chemotactic factor of anaphylaxis, leukotriene B4 and serotonin mediated release of eosinophil granules occur, complement complex (C5-C6-C7), interleukin 5, and histamine (though this has a narrow range of concentration).

Harm resulting from untreated eosinophilia potentially varies with cause. During an allergic reaction, the release of histamine from mast cells causes vasodilation which allows eosinophils to migrate from the blood and localize in affected tissues. Accumulation of eosinophils in tissues can be significantly damaging. Eosinophils, like other granulocytes, contain granules (or sacs) filled with digestive enzymes and cytotoxic proteins which under normal conditions are used to destroy parasites but in eosinophilia these agents can damage healthy tissues. In addition to these agents, the granules in eosinophils also contain inflammatory molecules and cytokines which can recruit more eosinophils and other inflammatory cells to the area and hence amplify and perpetuate the damage. This process is generally accepted to be the major inflammatory process in the pathophysiology of atopic or allergic asthma.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is by complete blood count (CBC). However, in some cases, a more accurate absolute eosinophil count may be needed. Medical history is taken, with emphasis on travel, allergies and drug use. Specific test for causative conditions are performed, often including chest x-ray, urinalysis, liver and kidney function tests, and serologic tests for parasitic and connective tissue diseases. The stool is often examined for traces of parasites (i.e. eggs, larvae, etc.) though a negative test does not rule out parasitic infection; for example, trichinosis requires a muscle biopsy. Elevated serum B12 or low white blood cell alkaline phosphatase, or leukocytic abnormalities in a peripheral smear indicates a disorder of myeloproliferation. In cases of idiopathic eosinophilia, the patient is followed for complications. A brief trial of corticosteroids can be diagnostic for allergic causes, as the eosinophilia should resolve with suppression of the immune over-response. Neoplastic disorders are diagnosed through the usual methods, such as bone marrow aspiration and biopsy for the leukemias, MRI/CT to look for solid tumors, and tests for serum LDH and other tumor markers.

==Treatment==
Treatment is directed toward the underlying cause. However, in primary eosinophilia, or if the eosinophil count must be lowered, corticosteroids such as prednisone may be used. However, immune suppression, the mechanism of action of corticosteroids, can be fatal in patients with parasitosis.

==List of causes==
Eosinophilia can be idiopathic (primary) or, more commonly, secondary to another disease. In the Western World, allergic or atopic diseases are the most common causes, especially those of the respiratory or integumentary systems. In the developing world, parasites are the most common cause. A parasitic infection of nearly any bodily tissue can cause eosinophilia.

<text>Air Force One is a 1997 American political action thriller film directed and co-produced by Wolfgang Petersen and starring Harrison Ford, Gary Oldman, Glenn Close, Wendy Crewson, Xander Berkeley, William H. Macy, Dean Stockwell, Paul Guilfoyle and Jürgen Prochnow. The film was written by Andrew W. Marlowe. It follows Air Force One being hijacked by a group of terrorists who demand the release of their country’s imprisoned dictator and the President&#x27;s attempt to rescue everyone on board by retaking his plane.

The film was a box office success and received mostly positive critical reviews. It became the fifth highest-grossing film of 1997, earning $315.2 million worldwide. It also received two Academy Award nominations for Best Sound and Best Film Editing, losing both awards to &quot;Titanic&quot;.

==Plot==
A joint operation between American and Russian special forces captures General Ivan Radek, the dictator of a rogue neo-Soviet regime in Kazakhstan that retained its nuclear weapons, threatening war. Three weeks later, U.S. President James Marshall attends a diplomatic dinner in Moscow, during which he praises the operation and insists the United States will no longer negotiate with terrorists. Marshall and his entourage, including his wife Grace and daughter Alice, and several of his cabinet and advisers, prepare to return home on Air Force One. However, six Radek loyalists disguised as journalists led by Egor Korshunov infiltrate the plane.

After takeoff, Secret Service agent Gibbs, a mole, enables Korshunov and his men to obtain weapons and hijack the plane, killing multiple security and military personnel before taking the rest hostage, including Grace and Alice. Marshall is raced to an escape pod in the cargo hold while pursued by Korshunov&#x27;s men, but they are too late to stop the pod from ejecting. Korshunov breaches the cockpit, aborting the plane from making an emergency landing at Ramstein Air Base. A squadron of F-15s escort Air Force One as Korshunov has it piloted towards a Radek-loyal airbase in Kazakhstan.

However, Marshall, a veteran of the Vietnam War and a Medal of Honor recipient, had hidden himself in the cargo hold instead of using the pod. He covertly kills two of Korshunov&#x27;s men and obtains a satellite phone to communicate with Vice President Kathryn Bennett, letting his staff know he is still alive and aboard the plane. Korshunov, assuming that it is merely a Secret Service agent in the cargo hold, contacts Bennett and demands Radek&#x27;s release, threatening to kill a hostage every half-hour. Marshall unsuccessfully tries to force Korshunov to land by dumping some fuel after rewiring the plane&#x27;s circuitry.

Marshall devises a plan to trick Korshunov into bringing Air Force One to a lower altitude of 15,000 feet for a mid-air refueling so that the hostages can parachute safely off the plane. As a KC-10 tanker docks with Air Force One, Marshall helps capture another loyalist and escorts the hostages to the cargo hold, where the majority parachutes to safety. Korshunov and his men discover the deception and catch Marshall, Chief of Staff Lloyd Shepherd, Major Norman Caldwell, and Gibbs. The induced turbulence severs the connection between the tanker and Air Force One, and the fuel leak ignites, destroying the tanker.

With the President and his family now under his control, Korshunov forces Marshall to contact Russian President Stolicha Petrov and arrange for Radek&#x27;s release. Bennett is urged by Defense Secretary Walter Dean to invoke the 25th Amendment, thus overriding Radek&#x27;s release, but she refuses. While Korshunov and his men celebrate Radek&#x27;s release, Marshall breaks free and kills Korshunov and his remaining loyalists. Marshall rescinds his order, and Radek is shot dead before he can escape.

Marshall and Caldwell direct the plane back to friendly airspace but are tailed by a second batch of Radek loyalists in MiG-29s. The F-15s rejoin with Air Force One and engage with the enemy aircraft, but Air Force One suffers severe damage to its fuel tanks, engines, and tail controls from the MiG-29&#x27;s gunfire, and an explosion from an F-15 when its pilot sacrifices himself to intercept a missile.

A standby United States Air Force Special Operations Command MC-130E with the callsign Liberty 24 is called to help, sending parajumpers on tether lines to rescue the survivors. Marshall insists that his family and the wounded Shepherd be transferred first. When there is time for only one more transfer, Gibbs reveals himself as the traitor, killing Caldwell and the parajumper. Marshall and Gibbs fight for control of the transfer line; Marshall attaches himself at the last moment. As the MC-130E airmen reel Marshall to safety, the now-inoperable Air Force One crashes into the Caspian Sea, killing Gibbs. With Marshall and his family confirmed safe, Liberty 24 is now given the callsign Air Force One as it flies off to safety.

==Production==
===Development===
A large part of the crew took a tour of the real Air Force One before filming. They based some of the film&#x27;s scenes on the touring experience when the terrorists disguised as journalists survey the plane&#x27;s layout and begin to take their seats. The character of Deputy Press Secretary Melanie Mitchell was based largely on their real-life tour guide, and the crew felt uncomfortable having to film the character&#x27;s execution by the terrorists. For the exterior scenes, the producers rented a Boeing 747-146 aircraft, N703CK from Kalitta Air and repainted it to replicate the &quot;Air Force One&quot; livery.

Air Force One is shown as being equipped with a one-person escape pod for emergency use by the President of the United States. It was also done this way in at least three other films, &quot;Escape from New York&quot;, &quot;Bermuda Tentacles&quot; and &quot;Big Game.&quot; The actual Air Force One does not have an escape pod.

Paul Attanasio was brought in as a script doctor to work on the film prior to shooting. Scenes explaining Agent Gibbs&#x27; motivation for being the mole were cut from the final script. According to director Wolfgang Petersen, the scene was considered too long to tell and so it was cut from the film. The director also felt that it was unnecessary to have the scene in the film so it was removed as it was irrelevant to the plot. In the original draft, Gibbs revealed himself as the mole early and joined the terrorists in hijacking the plane. The director felt it was more suspenseful to keep the audience in the know in the final cut and specifically pointed to the scene in which Marshall gives Gibbs a gun before escorting the hostages from the conference room to the parachutes in the cargo hold.

Gary Oldman was hired to play the role as the film&#x27;s villain after choosing not to accept a role in &quot;Speed 2: Cruise Control&quot;. Petersen later said he called the filming experience &quot;Air Force Fun&quot; because of how comic and genial Oldman would be off-screen. He also said that Oldman would suddenly return to the menacing film persona &quot;like a shot.&quot; Oldman used his acting fee for the film to help finance his directorial debut, &quot;Nil by Mouth&quot;.

Kevin Costner was offered the role of James Marshall but turned it down as he had other commitments, and the script was given to Harrison Ford who accepted it.

===Filming===
General Radek&#x27;s palace, seen in the film&#x27;s opening, was portrayed by two locations in Cleveland, Ohio: the exterior was Severance Hall, and the interior was the Cuyahoga County Courthouse. The Russian prison where Radek was incarcerated was the Ohio State Reformatory, previously seen in &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; and also used for Godsmack&#x27;s music video for &quot;Awake&quot; in 2000. Ramstein Air Base, Germany was portrayed by Rickenbacker Air National Guard Base, Ohio. The diplomatic dinner scene was shot at the Ebell of Los Angeles while a second unit captured scenes in Red Square in Moscow. Scenes featuring Sheremetyevo International Airport, the departure airport of Air Force One in the film, were shot at Los Angeles International Airport.

F-15C Eagle aircraft from the 33rd Operations Group, 33rd Fighter Wing at Eglin AFB, Florida were used in the film.

===Score===
Randy Newman was initially hired to write the film score; however, Petersen considered his composition to be almost a parody and commissioned Jerry Goldsmith to write and record a more somber and patriotic score in just twelve days, with assistance from Joel McNeely. After the experience, Goldsmith vowed to never again take on such a last-minute task.

The music label Varèse Sarabande released a soundtrack album featuring Goldsmith&#x27;s music. McNeely receives a credit on the back cover for &quot;Additional Music in the Motion Picture&quot;, but none of his work is on the CD, although his cues include the material heard when Air Force One is under attack. On September 27, 2019, a 2-CD release featuring the full score was released.

The first track of the soundtrack, &quot;The Parachutes&quot;, was used by Donald Trump during his campaign for president of the United States in 2016. The track was played in the background at the New York Hilton Midtown prior to Trump&#x27;s victory speech, following Hillary Clinton&#x27;s concession. The track was used repeatedly at campaign events with the Trump plane as background, leading the film&#x27;s producer to ask him to stop using it.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Air Force One&quot; has an approval rating of 79% based on 63 reviews, with an average rating of 7/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;This late-period Harrison Ford actioner is full of palpable, if not entirely seamless, thrills.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 62 out of 100, based on 25 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; awarded the film 3.5/4 stars, describing it as &quot;superior escapism&quot;, and concluding, &quot;&quot;Air Force One&quot; doesn&#x27;t insult the audience. It is crafted by a film-maker who takes pride in the thrills and sly fun he packs into every frame. Welcome to something rare in a summer of crass commercialism: a class act.&quot; Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; described the film as &quot;a preposterously pulpy but quite entertaining suspense meller [melodrama]&quot; that is &quot;spiked by some spectacularly staged and genuinely tense action sequences&quot;. He lauded the film&#x27;s antagonist: &quot;[Gary] Oldman, in his second malevolent lead of the summer, after &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;, registers strongly as a veteran of the Afghan campaign pushed to desperate lengths to newly ennoble his country.&quot;

In a mixed review, Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film 2.5 stars out of 4 and found it flawed and cliché-ridden yet &quot;well-served by the quality of the performances ... &quot;Air Force One&quot; is a fairly competent recycling of familiar ingredients, given an additional interest because of Harrison Ford&#x27;s personal appeal.&quot; Adam Mars-Jones of &quot;The Independent&quot; was more critical, calling it &quot;so preposterous that it begins to seem like a science-fiction artifact ... the product of a parallel-universe 1990s which somehow by-passed the decades since the 1950s.&quot;

President Bill Clinton saw the film twice while in office and gave it good reviews. He noted that certain elements of the film&#x27;s version of Air Force One, such as the escape pod and the rear parachute ramp, did not reflect features of the actual Air Force One (though since many Air Force One features are highly classified and &quot;need-to-know&quot;, these features cannot be completely ruled out). In the audio commentary, Wolfgang Petersen mused that although the real plane did not have those features at the time of the filming, they would probably be added by future governments.

During his campaign for the Presidency of the United States in the 2016 presidential election, businessman and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said he admired Ford for his role in &quot;Air Force One&quot; because he &quot;stood up for America&quot;. Ford responded by reasoning that &quot;it was just a film&quot; and doubted Trump&#x27;s presidential bid would be successful. In turn, Trump played the theme of Air Force One prior to his introduction speech as President-elect.

A &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; poll in 2016 named Harrison Ford&#x27;s James Marshall as the greatest fictional president.

===Box office===
As one of the most popular action films of the 1990s, &quot;Air Force One&quot; earned $37.1 million during its opening weekend and ranked number one at the box office, beating &quot;Men in Black&quot;. At the time, the film had the fourth-highest opening weekend of that year, behind the latter film, &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot; and &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;. It scored the highest opening weekend for an R-rated film, surpassing &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot;. The film would hold this record for three years until it was surpassed by &quot;Scary Movie&quot; in 2000. Additionally, the film achieved the highest opening weekend for a Harrison Ford film, surpassing the former record held by &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot;. For a decade, it would go on to hold this record until 2008 when it was taken by &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot;. &quot;Air Force One&quot; went on to make $172,650,002 (54.9%) domestically and $142,200,000 (45.1%) in other countries, bringing the total gross to $315.2 million.

===Accolades===
The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2001: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Thrills – Nominated

== Home media ==
&quot;Air Force One&quot; was released on VHS, LaserDisc, and DVD on February 10, 1998, and on Blu-ray on June 2, 2009. A 4K UHD Blu-ray followed on November 6, 2018.

The US LaserDisc release of the film is notorious among LaserDisc collectors as being extremely prone to &quot;Laser rot&quot;, a form of optical disc degradation, due to repeat production issues at the Sony DADC facility where the discs were produced.

==Novelization==
A novelization of the film was published in June 1997 by author Max Allan Collins. Although the book has the same central plot and outcomes as the film, its main storyline has additional scenes and lines not in the film. The book develops characters more than the film. Marshall is described as possessing a smile that is described in the novel as &quot;the most valuable weapon in his public relations arsenal&quot; (p. 11). He promotes an interventionist line on foreign policy and a strong stance against terrorism (met with political opposition from opposition Speaker of the House Franklin Danforth in the novel). He is described as a first-term President, up for re-election later on in the year that the film is set in. Marshall&#x27;s home state is Iowa. A two-term former governor of Iowa in the novel, he first campaigns in the film for the US House.

He graduated from University of Iowa in the early 1970s in the novel and may also have attended the University of Notre Dame. His senior Staff and Cabinet include Vice President Kathryn Bennett (former congresswoman and trial attorney from New Jersey), Chief of Staff Lloyd Shepherd (an old friend from U of I), National Security Advisor Jack Doherty, Secretary of Defense Walter Dean, Deputy NSA Director Thomas Lee, Deputy Press Secretary Melanie Mitchell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Northwood, and Air Force General Greeley (under whom Marshall served in Vietnam). His Party is Republican in the novel.

Marshall is described in the novel as &quot;a moderate-Republican version of Bill Clinton, minus the womanizing reputation, and without a hint of personal or professional scandal&quot; (p. 99–100). Korshunov&#x27;s family is expanded upon, and it is revealed that Korshunov is not his real name. Unlike the movie, Gibbs&#x27;s identity as the traitor is not revealed until the end of the book. It also hints at his motivation: &quot;What he did remember, as he sipped his coffee, was that he knew these men, had worked with these men, and it was a damn shame they had to die so that he could be wealthy.&quot; Korshunov later tells Marshall he &quot;paid&quot; him off. It also presents a slightly alternative ending: in the novel, Air Force One crashes in the Russian countryside, whereas in the film, it crashes into the Caspian Sea.

<text>The Battle of the Trebia (or Trebbia) was the first major battle of the Second Punic War, fought between the Carthaginian forces of Hannibal and a Roman army under Sempronius Longus on 22 or 23 December 218 BC. Each army had a strength of about 40,000 men; the Carthaginians were stronger in cavalry, the Romans in infantry. The battle took place on the flood plain of the west bank of the lower Trebia River, not far from the settlement of Placentia (modern Piacenza), and resulted in a heavy defeat for the Romans.

War broke out between Carthage and Rome in 218 BC. The leading Carthaginian general, Hannibal, responded by leading a large army out of Iberia (modern Spain and Portugal), through Gaul, across the Alps and into Cisalpine Gaul (in northern Italy). The Romans went on the attack against the reduced force which had survived the rigours of the march, and Publius Scipio personally led the cavalry and light infantry of the army he commanded against the Carthaginian cavalry at the Battle of Ticinus. The Romans were soundly beaten and Scipio was wounded. The Romans retreated to near Placentia, fortified their camp and awaited reinforcement. The Roman army in Sicily under Sempronius was redeployed to the north and joined with Scipio&#x27;s force. After a day of heavy skirmishing in which the Romans gained the upper hand, Sempronius was eager for a battle.

Hannibal used his Numidian cavalry to lure the Romans out of their camp and onto ground of his choosing. Fresh Carthaginian cavalry routed the outnumbered Roman cavalry and Carthaginian light infantry outflanked the Roman infantry. A previously hidden Carthaginian force attacked the Roman infantry in the rear. Most of the Roman units then collapsed and most Romans were killed or captured by the Carthaginians, but 10,000 under Sempronius maintained formation and fought their way out to the safety of Placentia. Recognising the Carthaginians as the dominant force in Cisalpine Gaul, Gallic recruits flocked to them, and Hannibal&#x27;s army grew to 60,000. The following spring, it moved south into Roman Italy and gained another victory at the Battle of Lake Trasimene. In 216 BC Hannibal marched to southern Italy and inflicted the disastrous defeat of the Battle of Cannae on the Romans, the last of what modern historians describe as the three great military calamities suffered by the Romans in the first three years of the war.

== Background ==
===Pre-war===


The First Punic War was fought from 264 to 241 BC between Carthage and Rome: these two main powers of the western Mediterranean in the 3rd century BC struggled for supremacy primarily on the Mediterranean island of Sicily and its surrounding waters and in North Africa. The war lasted for 23 years until the Carthaginians were defeated. Five years later an army commanded by the leading Carthaginian general Hamilcar Barca landed in Carthaginian Iberia (modern south-east Spain) which he greatly expanded and turned into a quasi-monarchical, autonomous territory ruled by his family, the Barcids. This expansion gained Carthage silver mines, agricultural wealth, manpower, military facilities such as shipyards and territorial depth, which encouraged it to resist future Roman demands.

Hamilcar ruled Carthaginian Iberia autonomously until his death in 228 BC. He was succeeded by his son-in-law, Hasdrubal and in 221 BC by his son Hannibal. In 226 BC the Ebro Treaty established the Ebro River as the northern boundary of the Carthaginian sphere of influence in Iberia. A little later Rome made a separate treaty of association with the independent city of Saguntum (modern Sagunto), well south of the Ebro. In 219 BC a Carthaginian army under Hannibal besieged, captured and sacked Saguntum, which led Rome to declare war on Carthage.

===War in Cisalpine Gaul===

It was the long-standing Roman procedure to elect two men each year as senior magistrates, known as consuls, who in time of war would each lead an army. In 218 BC the Romans raised an army to campaign in Iberia under the consul Publius Scipio, who was accompanied by his brother Gnaeus. The major Gallic tribes in the area of north Italy either side of the River Po known as Cisalpine Gaul were antagonised by the settling of Roman colonists at Piacentia (modern Piacenza) and Cremona earlier that year on traditionally Gallic territory. They rose and attacked the Romans, capturing several towns. They repeatedly ambushed a Roman relief force and blockaded it in Tannetum. The Roman Senate detached one Roman and one allied legion from the force intended for Iberia to send to the region. The Scipios had to raise fresh troops to replace these and thus could not set out for Iberia until September.

=== Carthage invades Italy===


Meanwhile, Hannibal assembled a Carthaginian army in the Iberian city of New Carthage (modern Cartagena) in late 219 and early 218 BC. This marched north in May 218 BC, entering Gaul to the east of the Pyrenees, then taking an inland route to avoid Roman allies along the coast. Hannibal left his brother Hasdrubal Barca in charge of Carthaginian interests in Iberia. The Roman fleet carrying the Scipio brothers&#x27; army landed at Rome&#x27;s ally Massalia (modern Marseille) at the mouth of the River Rhone in September, at about the same time as Hannibal was fighting his way across the river against a force of local Allobroges at the Battle of Rhone Crossing. A Roman cavalry patrol scattered a force of Carthaginian cavalry, but Hannibal&#x27;s main army evaded the Romans and Gnaeus Scipio continued to Iberia with the Roman force; Publius returned to Italy. The Carthaginians crossed the Alps with 38,000 infantry and 8,000 cavalry in October, surmounting the difficulties of climate, terrain and the guerrilla tactics of the native tribes.

Hannibal arrived with 20,000 infantry, 6,000 cavalry and about 30 war elephants from the force with which he had left Iberia in what is now Piedmont, northern Italy. The Romans had already withdrawn to their winter quarters and were astonished by Hannibal&#x27;s appearance. The Carthaginians needed to obtain supplies of food, as they had exhausted theirs during their journey. They also wanted to obtain allies among the north-Italian Gallic tribes from which they could recruit, to build up their army to a size which would enable it to effectively take on the Romans. The local tribe, the Taurini, were unwelcoming, so Hannibal promptly besieged their capital (near the site of modern Turin), stormed it, massacred the population and seized the supplies there. With these brutal actions Hannibal was sending out a clear message to the other Gallic tribes as to the likely consequences of non-cooperation.

Hearing that Publius Scipio was operating in the region, Hannibal assumed the Roman army in Massalia, which he had believed en route to Iberia, had returned to Italy and reinforced the army already based in the north. Believing that he would therefore be facing a much larger Roman force than he had anticipated, Hannibal felt an even more pressing need to recruit strongly among the Cisalpine Gauls. He determined that a display of confidence was called for and advanced boldly down the valley of the Po. However, Scipio led his army equally boldly against the Carthaginians, causing the Gauls to remain neutral. Both commanders attempted to inspire the ardour of their men for the coming battle by making fiery speeches to their assembled armies. Hannibal is reported to have stressed to his troops that they had to win, whatever the cost, as there was no place they could retreat to.

===First contact===
After camping at Placentia the Romans constructed a pontoon bridge across the lower River Ticinus and continued west. With his scouts reporting the nearby presence of Carthaginians, Scipio ordered his army to encamp. The Carthaginians did the same. Next day each commander led out a strong force to personally reconnoitre the size and make-up of the opposing army, things of which they would have been almost completely ignorant. Scipio mixed a large force of (javelin-armed light infantry) with his main cavalry force, anticipating a large-scale skirmish. Hannibal put his close-order cavalry in the centre of his line, with his light Numidian cavalry on the wings.
On sighting the Roman infantry the Carthaginian centre immediately charged and the javelin-men fled back through the ranks of their cavalry. A large mêlée ensued, with many cavalry dismounting to fight on foot and many of the Roman javelin-men reinforcing the fighting line. This continued indecisively until the Numidian cavalry swept round both ends of the line of battle and attacked the still disorganised , the small Roman cavalry reserve to which Scipio had attached himself, and the rear of the already engaged Roman cavalry, throwing them all into confusion and panic. The Romans broke and fled, with heavy casualties. Scipio was wounded and only saved from death or capture by his 16-year-old son, also named Publius Cornelius Scipio. That night Scipio broke camp and retreated over the Ticinus; the Carthaginians captured 600 of his rearguard the next day.

The Romans withdrew as far as Placentia. Two days after this clash the Carthaginians crossed the River Po and marched towards Placentia. They formed up outside the Roman camp and offered battle, which Scipio refused. The Carthaginians set up their own camp some away. That night 2,200 Gallic troops serving with the Roman army attacked the Romans closest to them in their tents and deserted to the Carthaginians, taking the Romans&#x27; heads with them as a sign of good faith. Hannibal rewarded them and sent them back to their homes to enrol more recruits. Hannibal also made his first formal treaty with a Gallic tribe and supplies and recruits started to come in. The Romans abandoned their camp and withdrew under cover of night. The next morning the Carthaginian cavalry bungled their pursuit and the Romans were able to set up camp on an area of high ground by the River Trebia at what is now Rivergaro, a little south west of Placentia. Even so, they had to abandon much of their baggage and heavier gear and many stragglers were killed or captured. Scipio waited for reinforcements while Hannibal camped at a distance on the plain on the other side of the river, gathering supplies and training the Gauls now flocking to his standard.

==Prelude==
Rome&#x27;s other consul, Sempronius Longus, had been assembling an army in western Sicily, with which it was planned to invade Africa the following year. Shocked by Hannibal&#x27;s arrival and Scipio&#x27;s setback, the Senate ordered this army to move north to assist Scipio. It probably covered part of the distance by sea as it arrived at Ariminum (modern Rimini) only 40 days later. Sempronius&#x27;s army then marched to join Scipio&#x27;s on the Trebia and set up camp alongside it. As Scipio was still partly incapacitated by his wounds Sempronius took overall command. Meanwhile, Hannibal bribed a force of Roman allies from Brundisium (modern Brindisi) garrisoning a large grain depot at Clastidium (modern Casteggio), to the west, into surrendering the place. This resolved any remaining Carthaginian logistical difficulties.

During the Punic Wars formal battles were usually preceded by the two armies camping two to twelve kilometres (1–8 miles) apart for days or weeks; sometimes forming up in battle order each day. During these periods when armies were encamped in close proximity it was common for their light forces to skirmish with each other, attempting to gather information on each other&#x27;s forces and achieve minor, morale-raising victories. These were typically fluid affairs and viewed as preliminaries to any subsequent battle. In such circumstances either commander could prevent a battle from occurring; unless both commanders were to at least some degree willing to give battle, either side might march off without engaging. Forming up in battle order was a complicated and premeditated affair, which took several hours. Infantry were usually positioned in the centre of the battle line, with light infantry skirmishers to their front and cavalry on each flank. Many battles were decided when one side&#x27;s infantry force was partially or wholly enveloped and attacked in the flank or rear. In 218 BC the two armies established camps about from each other on opposite sides of the River Trebia. The Romans&#x27; was on an easily defended low hill to the east of the Trebia and the Carthaginians&#x27; was on high ground to the west.

While waiting to see what Sempronius would do, Hannibal came to believe some of the Gauls in the immediate area were communicating with the Romans. He sent a force of 3,000 men, partly composed of Gauls, to devastate the area and plunder their settlements. Sempronius sent a force of cavalrylarge, but of unknown sizesupported by 1,000 to challenge them. As they were dispersed between a large number of settlements and many were burdened with plunder and looted food, the Carthaginians were easily routed and fled back to their camp. The Romans pursued, but were in turn thrown back by the Carthaginian reserve force on duty at the camp. Roman reinforcements were called in, eventually amounting to all 4,000 of their cavalry and 6,000 light infantry. How many Carthaginians were involved is unclear, but a large, fast-moving conflict sprawled across the plain. Hannibal was concerned that it would develop into a full-scale battle in a manner which he would not be able to control, so he recalled his troops and took personal command of reforming them immediately outside his camp. This brought the fighting to an end, as the Romans were unwilling to attack uphill against an enemy who would be supported by missile fire from within their camp. The Romans withdrew, claiming the victory: they had inflicted more casualties and the Carthaginians had abandoned the field of battle to them.

Hannibal had deliberately brought the battle to a close, but Sempronius interpreted events as the Roman cavalry having dominated the Carthaginians. Sempronius was eager for a full-scale battle: he wished it to take place before Scipio fully recovered and so would be able to share the glory of an anticipated victory. He was also aware that he would be superseded in his position in less than three months, when the new consuls would take up their positions. Hannibal was also ready for a set-piece battle: he wished his new Gallic allies to participate in a victory before boredom and winter weather provoked desertions; and was possibly concerned by the recent suspected Gallic treachery in the immediate area. He also preferred to fight a battle on the flat and open floodplain of the Trebia, where the manoeuvrability of his cavalry could be used to greatest effect, to the hillier ground away from the river where the Roman heavy infantry would have found it easier to dominate. From the enthusiastic way in which Sempronius had reinforced his cavalry, Hannibal felt confident that he could provoke a battle at a time and place of his choosing.

==Opposing forces==
=== Roman ===

Most male Roman citizens were liable for military service and would serve as infantry, with a better-off minority providing a cavalry component. Traditionally, when at war the Romans would raise two legions, each of 4,200 infantry and 300 cavalry. Approximately 1,200 of the infantrypoorer or younger men unable to afford the armour and equipment of a standard legionaryserved as javelin-armed skirmishers known as ; they each carried several javelins, which would be thrown from a distance, a short sword and a circular shield. The balance were equipped as heavy infantry, with body armour, a large shield and short thrusting swords. They were divided into three ranks, of which the front rank, known as , also carried two javelins. The second rank, known as , were very similarly equipped but wore better armour and consisted of older, more experienced men. The third rank consisted of the , the veterans of the army, equipped with a thrusting spear instead. Both legionary sub-units and individual legionaries fought in relatively open order.

A consular army was usually formed by combining a Roman legion with a similarly sized and equipped legion provided by their Latin allies; allied legions usually had a larger attached complement of cavalry than Roman ones. In 218 BC each consul was leading a larger army of four legions, two Roman and two provided by its allies, for a total of approximately 20,000 men.

The combined force which Sempronius led into battle included four Roman legions. At full strength these should have mustered 16,800 men, including 4,800 ; at least one of the legions is known to have been significantly understrength. The near-contemporary Greek historian Polybius gives a total of 16,000 Romans, the Roman historian Livy, writing 200 years later, gives 18,000. In addition there were approximately 20,000 allied infantry, comprising four Latin allied legions and a strong force of Gauls. Mention is made of 6,000 light infantry and it is unclear whether these are included in the 36,000, or 38,000, infantry or in addition to them. As the nominal total number of from eight legions is 9,600, and it is known that many were lost at the Battle of the Ticinus, most modern historians assume that the 6,000 are included within the total number of infantry given. There were also 4,000 cavalry, a mixture of Romans, Latin allies and Gauls.

===Carthaginian===
Carthaginian citizens only served in their army if there was a direct threat to the city of Carthage. In most circumstances Carthage recruited foreigners to make up its army. Many were from North Africa and these were frequently referred to as &quot;Libyans&quot;. The region provided several types of fighters, including: close-order infantry equipped with large shields, helmets, short swords and long thrusting spears; javelin-armed light infantry skirmishers; close-order shock cavalry (also known as &quot;heavy cavalry&quot;) carrying spears; and light cavalry skirmishers who threw javelins from a distance and avoided close combat; the latter were usually Numidians. The close-order African infantry fought in a tightly packed formation known as a phalanx. On occasion some of the infantry would wear captured Roman armour, especially among Hannibal&#x27;s troops.

In addition both Iberia and Gaul provided many experienced infantry and cavalry. The close-order or &quot;heavy&quot; infantry from these areas were unarmoured troops who would charge ferociously, but had a reputation for breaking off if a combat was protracted. The Gallic cavalry, and possibly some of the Iberians, wore armour and fought as close-order troops; most or all of the mounted Iberians were light cavalry. Slingers were frequently recruited from the Balearic Islands. The Carthaginians also employed war elephants; North Africa had indigenous elephants at the time. The sources are not clear as to whether they carried towers containing fighting men.

Hannibal had arrived in Italy with 20,000 infantry and 6,000 cavalry. At Trebia this had grown to 29,000 infantry21,000 close-order and 8,000 light infantry and 11,000 cavalry. In each case they would be a combination of Africans, Iberians and Gauls; the proportions are not known, other than that 8,000 of the close-order infantry were Gauls. In addition there were about 30 elephants, the survivors of the 37 with which he had left Iberia.
==Battle==
=== Early stages ===

The terrain between the Carthaginian camp and the Trebia was an unwooded flood plain, where it was apparently impossible to stage an ambush. Hannibal, however, had his younger brother Mago take 1,000 cavalry and 1,000 infantry during the night to the south of where he intended to fight the battle and secrete themselves in an old watercourse full of brush. 

The next morning, either 22 or 23 December, was cold and snowy. Shortly before daybreak Hannibal sent his Numidian cavalry across the river to force back the Roman pickets and provoke a fight. Meanwhile, the rest of his army ate an early breakfast and prepared for battle. When the Numidians appeared Sempronius ordered out all of his cavalry to chase them off. Polybius writes &quot;the Numidians easily scattered and retreated, but afterwards wheeled round and attacked with great daring—these being their peculiar tactics.&quot; The confrontation broke down into a wheeling mass of cavalry, but with the Numidians refusing to withdraw, Sempronius promptly ordered out first his 6,000 and then his whole army; he was so eager to give battle that few, if any, of the Romans had eaten breakfast. The Numidians withdrew slowly and Sempronius pushed his whole army after them, in three columns, each long, through the icy waters of the Trebia, which was running chest-high. The Romans were met by the Carthaginian light infantry; behind them the entire Carthaginian army was forming up for battle. The Romans also organised themselves in battle formation and advanced.

The cavalry of both sides fell back to their positions on the wings. The large number of light infantry in each armyentirely javelin-men for the Romans, a mixture of javelin-men and slingers from the Balearics for the Carthaginiansskirmished between the main armies. The Roman had used many of their javelins against the Carthaginian cavalry, while the Carthaginian skirmishers were fully supplied, and the slingers among the Carthaginians outranged the by some distance. As opposed to their opponents, the were unfed, and also tired and cold from having forded the Trebia. For these reasons the Carthaginians got the better of the initial skirmishing and drove the back through the gaps in their supporting heavy infantry. The Carthaginian light infantry then moved towards the flanks of their army and harassed the Roman cavalry with their missiles, before finally falling back behind their own cavalry as the gap between the armies closed.

=== Formations ===
The Carthaginian army formed up symmetrically: the 8,000 Gallic infantry were in the centre; on each side of them was a formation of 6,000 African and Iberian veteran infantry; on the far side of each of these were half of the surviving elephants; and on each wing were 5,000 cavalry. The Romans too formed up symmetrically: the Roman heavy infantry were in the centre, perhaps 13,000 strong; on each side of them were part of their allied force, some 17,000 in totalthis included a force of still-loyal Cisalpine Gauls, but the sources are unclear as to how many or where they were positioned. The survivors of the 6,000 were regrouping to their rear. Like the Carthaginians, the Romans divided their 4,000 cavalry between their wings.

===Engagement===

The Romans had a total of approximately 30,000 heavy infantry to the Carthaginians&#x27; 20,000 and could expect sooner or later to overwhelm their opponents by weight of numbers. The Carthaginian line was also in danger of being outflanked by the stronger Roman force; to guard against this Hannibal thinned the Carthaginian line, especially that of the Gauls in the centre, to be able to lengthen it to match the Romans&#x27;. Also, with tactical forethought typical of him, he had positioned the elephants on either side of the infantry, which discouraged the Roman infantry from approaching their flanks too closely.

On each wing 5,000 Carthaginian and 2,000 Roman cavalry charged each other. The Roman cavalry were not only outnumbered, but their horses were tired from chasing the Numidian cavalry and many had been wounded by the missiles of the Carthaginian light infantry. Both encounters ended rapidly, with the Romans fleeing back over the Trebia and most of the Carthaginian cavalry pursuing them. Goldsworthy describes the fight put up by the Roman cavalry as &quot;feeble&quot;, while the military historian Philip Sabin says that the two contests were &quot;speedily decided&quot;. The Carthaginian light infantry, who had withdrawn to the wings behind the cavalry, moved forward and round the now exposed Roman flanks. The Roman light infantry, who had withdrawn to the rear of Roman heavy infantry, turned to face this developing Carthaginian threat. Many of the Roman allied heavy infantry on each flank also turned to their flanks to face this new threat, which inevitably took much of the impetus out of their parent formation&#x27;s push against the African and Iberian infantry to their fronts.

At the same time, unnoticed in the heat of battle, Mago&#x27;s force of 2,000 had been making its way down the watercourse, onto the plain and into a position where they could attack the Romans&#x27; left rear. While all this was happening, the fighting between the two heavy infantry contingents had continued fiercely, with the more numerous and better armoured Romans getting the better of it; despite being weakened by many of their component units having to turn to the flank or rear. Mago&#x27;s force charged into the who were already fending off the Carthaginian light infantry, but their formation held. Some of the rear rank of the legions, the , turned to assist the . Increasing numbers of Carthaginian cavalry broke off their pursuit, returned and attacked the Roman rear. Eventually the strain told and the units of Latin allies and Gauls on the flanks and the to the rear started to break up.

Meanwhile, the Roman infantry in the centre routed the 8,000 Gauls facing them, as well as a unit of African heavy infantry, and broke clean through the centre of the Carthaginian army. By the time they halted their pursuit and reorganised it was clear the rest of their army behind them had dissolved and that the battle was lost. Sempronius, who was fighting with the Roman infantry, ordered them away from the site of the battle and, maintaining their formation, 10,000 of them re-crossed the Trebia and reached the nearby Roman-held settlement of Placentia without interference from the Carthaginians. The Carthaginians concentrated on pursuing and cutting down the partially surrounded balance of the Roman army.

=== Casualties ===
There is debate among modern historians as to the Roman losses. Dexter Hoyos states that the only Roman survivors were the infantry who broke through the Carthaginian centre. Richard Miles says that &quot;many&quot; not in this group were killed; Nigel Bagnall writes that only a minority of the Roman cavalry survived. Goldsworthy states that the Romans &quot;suffered heavily&quot;, but that &quot;numbers of soldiers&quot; straggled into Placentia or one of their camps in addition to the formed group of 10,000, while John Lazenby argues that outside of the 12,500, &quot;few&quot; infantry escaped, although &quot;most&quot; of the cavalry did, as does Leonard Cottrell. According to Paul Erdkamp, the Romans lost 20,000 killed during the battle, half of their force; this excludes those captured.

Carthaginian losses are generally agreed to have been several thousand of the Gallic infantry in the centre, a smaller number of their other infantry and of their cavalry; and several elephants. Many of the African infantry were re-equipped with captured Roman armour and weapons.

==Aftermath==
As was usual at the time, the Romans had left a strong guard at their camps. On hearing the news of the defeat the wounded Scipio gathered them together and marched to Placentia, where he joined Sempronius. When news of the defeat reached Rome it initially caused panic. But this calmed once Sempronius arrived, to preside over the consular elections in the usual manner. Gnaeus Servilius Geminus and Gaius Flaminius were selected and Sempronius then returned to Placentia to see out his term to 15 March. The Carthaginian cavalry isolated both Placentia and Cremona, but these could be supplied by boat up the Po. The consuls-elect recruited further legions, both Roman and from Rome&#x27;s Latin allies; reinforced Sardinia and Sicily against the possibility of Carthaginian raids or invasion; placed garrisons at Tarentum and other places for similar reasons; built a fleet of 60 quinqueremes (large galleys); and established supply depots at Ariminum and Arretium (modern Arezzo) in Etruria in preparation for marching north later in the year. Two armiesof four legions each, two Roman and two allied, but with stronger than usual cavalry contingentswere formed. One was stationed at Arretium and one on the Adriatic coast; they would be able to block Hannibal&#x27;s possible advance into central Italy and be well positioned to move north to operate in Cisalpine Gaul.

According to Polybius, the Carthaginians were now recognised as the dominant force in Cisalpine Gaul and most of the Gallic tribes sent plentiful supplies and recruits to Hannibal&#x27;s camp. Livy, however, claims the Carthaginians suffered from a shortage of food throughout the winter. In Polybius&#x27;s account there were only minor operations during the winter and most of the surviving Romans were evacuated down the Po and assigned to one of the two new armies being formed, while the flow of Gallic support for the Carthaginians became a flood and their army grew to 60,000. Livy retails dramatic accounts of winter confrontations, but Goldsworthy describes these as &quot;probably an invention&quot;.

== Subsequent campaigns ==
In spring 217BC, probably early May, the Carthaginians crossed the Apennine Mountains unopposed, taking a difficult but unguarded route. Hannibal attempted without success to draw the main Roman army under Gaius Flaminius into a pitched battle by devastating the area. The Carthaginians then flanked Flaminius, cutting his supply line to Rome, which provoked him into a hasty pursuit without proper reconnaissance. That the Carthaginians continued to lay waste to farms and villages on their line of march probably spurred Flaminius and his men in their pursuit. Hannibal set an ambush and in the Battle of Lake Trasimene surprised and completely defeated the Romans, killing Flaminius and another 15,000 Romans and taking 15,000 prisoner. A cavalry force of 4,000 from the other Roman army was also engaged and wiped out.

Roman prisoners were treated badly, but captured Roman allies were treated well. Many were soon freed and sent back to their cities, in the hope that they would speak well of Carthaginian martial prowess and of their treatment. Hannibal hoped some of these allies could be persuaded to defect and marched south in the hope of winning over some of the ethnic Greek and Italic city states. There, the following year, Hannibal won a victory at Cannae which Richard Miles describes as &quot;Rome&#x27;s greatest military disaster&quot;. The historian Toni Ñaco del Hoyo describes the Trebia, Lake Trasimene and Cannae as the three &quot;great military calamities&quot; suffered by the Romans in the first three years of the war. Subsequently the Carthaginians campaigned in southern Italy for a further 13 years.

In 204 BC Publius Cornelius Scipio, the son of the Scipio who had been wounded at Ticinus, invaded the Carthaginian homeland and defeated the Carthaginians in two major battles and won the allegiance of the Numidian kingdoms of North Africa. Hannibal and the remnants of his army were recalled from Italy to confront him. They met at the Battle of Zama in October 202BC where Hannibal was decisively defeated. As a consequence Carthage agreed a peace treaty which stripped it of most of its territory and power.

<text>In philosophy, correlative-based fallacies are informal fallacies based on correlative conjunctions.

== Correlative conjunctions ==
A correlative conjunction is a relationship between two statements where one must be false and the other true. In formal logic this is known as the exclusive or relationship; traditionally, terms between which this relationship exists have been called &quot;contradictories&quot;.

=== Examples ===
In the following example, statement &quot;b&quot; explicitly negates statement &quot;a&quot;:
Statements can also be mutually exclusive, without explicitly negating each other as in the following example:
== Fallacies ==
Fallacies based on correlatives include:

;False dilemma or &quot;false correlative&quot;.
:Here something which is not a correlative is treated as a correlative, excluding some other possibility.
;Denying the correlative
:where an attempt is made to introduce another option into a true correlative.
;Suppressed correlative
:where the definitions of a correlative are changed so that one of the options includes the other, making one option impossible.

<doc id="238815" wikidata="Q1682044" url="?curid=238815" title="Monocytosis">
<text>Monocytosis is an increase in the number of monocytes circulating in the blood. Monocytes are white blood cells that give rise to macrophages and dendritic cells in the immune system.

In humans, monocytosis occurs when there is a sustained rise in monocyte counts greater than 800/mm3 to 1000/mm3.

Monocytosis has sometimes been called mononucleosis, but that name is usually reserved specifically for infectious mononucleosis. 

==Causes==
Monocytosis often occurs during chronic inflammation. Diseases that produce such a chronic inflammatory state:
* Infections: tuberculosis, brucellosis, listeriosis, subacute bacterial endocarditis, syphilis, and other viral infections and many protozoal and rickettsial infections (e.g. kala azar, malaria, Rocky Mountain spotted fever).
* Blood and immune causes: chronic neutropenia and myeloproliferative disorders.
* Autoimmune diseases and vasculitis: systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease.
* Malignancies: Hodgkin&#x27;s disease and certain leukaemias, such as chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) and monocytic leukemia.
* Recovery phase of neutropenia or an acute infection.
* Obesity (cf. Nagareddy et al. (2014), Cell Metabolism, Vol. 19, pp 821–835)
* Miscellaneous causes: sarcoidosis, drug overdose, lipid storage disease and ZNFX1 deficiency.

During these stages of extreme inflammation, monocytosis can damage tissues because it increases the activation of the immune response and prevents the inflammation from subsiding which is seen in cases where sepsis occurs.

==Diagnosis==
* Blood Test (CBC) (Normal range of Monocytes: 1-10%) (Normal range in males: 0.2-0.8 x 103/microliter)
* Blood test checking for monocytosis (Abnormal ranges: &gt;10%) (Abnormal range in males: &gt;0.8 x 103/microliter)

==Treatment==
Ceftriaxone if there is typhoid fever and levofloxacin or moxifloxacin.
Gentamicin and doxycyclin if brucellosis.

<text>Amélie Simone Mauresmo (; born 5 July 1979) is a French former professional tennis player, tennis coach, and tournament director. She was ranked as the world No. 1 in women&#x27;s singles by the Women&#x27;s Tennis Association (WTA) for 39 weeks. Mauresmo won 25 WTA Tour-level singles titles, including two majors at the 2006 Australian Open and the 2006 Wimbledon Championships, as well as the 2005 WTA Tour Championships. She also won an Olympic silver medal in singles at the 2004 Athens Olympics. Mauresmo was known for her powerful one-handed backhand and strong net play.

Mauresmo officially announced her retirement from professional tennis on 3 December 2009, ending a career of 15 years. The following year, she started her coaching career, covering both WTA and ATP players, including ATP world No. 1 Andy Murray. She was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2015. In 2021, Mauresmo was named the director of the French Open.

==Early life==
Mauresmo was born in Saint-Germain-en-Laye, slightly northwest of Paris. She began playing tennis at the age of four, after being inspired by Yannick Noah&#x27;s win in the 1983 French Open on television. It was after his win that Mauresmo&#x27;s parents bought her her first tennis racket. In 1998 Noah picked her on the French team for the Fed Cup. Her mother Françoise is a housewife and her father Francis, who died in March 2004, was an engineer. She has a brother, Fabien, who is an engineer.

In 1996, Mauresmo won both the junior French Open and Wimbledon singles titles. She was later named 1996 Junior World Champion by the International Tennis Federation.

==Player career==
The unseeded Mauresmo reached the Australian Open final in 1999 with wins over three seeded players, including world No. 1, Lindsay Davenport, before falling to world No. 2, Martina Hingis. Mauresmo was only the second Frenchwoman ever to reach the Australian Open final; (Mary Pierce was the first, winning the championship in 1995). She was only the third Frenchwoman to reach any Grand Slam final during the Open Era.

Mauresmo defeated Hingis later in the year, en route to the final of the Paris indoor event.

After the defeat of Davenport at the Australian Open, Mauresmo, 19 at the time, came out as gay to the international press. She &quot;attributed her success on the court to coming to terms with her sexuality and finding love.&quot;

===2004: Olympic silver, world No. 1===
Mauresmo reached the semifinals at Wimbledon, where she lost to Serena Williams in three sets after winning the first set and up a break in the second set. She reached the quarterfinals of the three other Grand Slam tournaments and won three Tier I titles in Rome, Berlin, and Montreal.

Mauresmo won a silver medal in singles at the Olympic Games in Athens, where she was defeated by Justine Henin in the final.

On 13 September 2004, Mauresmo became the first French tennis player to become world No. 1 since the computer rankings began in the 1970s. She held that ranking for five weeks and was the second woman, after Kim Clijsters, to have attained the top spot without having won a Grand Slam title.

===2005: WTA Tour Championships crown===
Mauresmo reached the quarterfinals of the Australian Open, but was defeated there by eventual champion Serena Williams.

At the French Open, seeded third, Mauresmo was upset in the third round by the then little-known 17-year-old Ana Ivanovic, in three sets. Mauresmo had, at the Australian Open earlier in the year, become the first player to defeat the Serb in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament, winning in straight sets also in the third round.

At the US Open, Mauresmo lost in the quarterfinals to Mary Pierce, in straight sets. That followed a semifinal loss to Lindsay Davenport at Wimbledon.
Mauresmo claimed her first singles title at the WTA Tour Championships. She defeated Pierce in the final after losing to Pierce in a round-robin match at that tournament, in three sets.

===2006: Two Grand Slam titles, back to No. 1===
At the Australian Open, Mauresmo captured her first Grand Slam singles title, defeating Belgian former world No. 1 players, Kim Clijsters and Justine Henin, en route. Both opponents retired from their respective matches, Clijsters with a right ankle sprain in the third set of their semifinal and Henin from gastroenteritis in the final. Mauresmo was leading in both matches at the time of the retirements, by 6–1, 2–0 against Henin.

Mauresmo then won her next two tournaments, the Open Gaz de France tournament in Paris (defeating Mary Pierce in the final) and the Proximus Diamond Games in Antwerp, Belgium (defeating Clijsters in the final).

At the Qatar Open in Doha, Mauresmo defeated Martina Hingis in a semifinal, 6–2, 6–2, but lost to Nadia Petrova in the final. Had she won the final, she would have immediately regained the world No. 1 ranking from Clijsters. Nonetheless, the outcome was sufficient to ensure Mauresmo&#x27;s return to the world number-one ranking on 20 March 2006.

Mauresmo then reached the semifinals of the Miami Open in Key Biscayne, Florida, where she lost to the eventual champion Svetlana Kuznetsova.

Mauresmo lost in the fourth round of the French Open to Czech teenager Nicole Vaidišová, 6–7, 6–1, 6–2. Mauresmo next suffered a first-round loss at the Wimbledon warm-up tournament in Eastbourne. However, Mauresmo and Kuznetsova won the doubles title there, their first as a team and Mauresmo&#x27;s second overall.

Mauresmo was the top seed at Wimbledon. She defeated Anastasia Myskina in a quarterfinal and Maria Sharapova in a semifinal, and then came back from one set down to defeat Henin in the final 2–6, 6–3, 6–4. The victory was Mauresmo&#x27;s second Grand Slam singles title and the first on grass. She was also the first Frenchwoman since Suzanne Lenglen to win Wimbledon. She remains the most recent woman to win Wimbledon with a single-handed backhand. The Wimbledon final was notable because it was the first and only time in the decade that neither Williams sister qualified for the final.

She then pulled out of the Fed Cup World Group I playoff tie against the Czech Republic due to a groin injury sustained during Wimbledon. She also withdrew from the Rogers Cup in Montreal.

Her next tournament was the Pilot Pen Tennis tournament in New Haven, Connecticut, where she lost in the quarterfinals to Lindsay Davenport, 4–6, 5–7.

At the US Open, Mauresmo lost to Sharapova in the semifinals 0–6, 6–4, 0–6. This was the first time in the open era that a female had lost two sets at love in a US Open semifinal.

Mauresmo then reached the final of the China Open, losing to Kuznetsova. During the tournament, Mauresmo won 137 ranking points to help preserve her world no. 1 ranking and ended a nine-match losing streak to Davenport stretching back to January 2000 in Sydney.

To conclude the year, Mauresmo reached the final of the WTA Tour Championships in Madrid, losing to Henin, 4–6, 3–6. Mauresmo finished the year ranked world No. 3, behind Henin and Sharapova.

===2007: Out of the top 5===
Mauresmo started the year in Australia with a quarterfinal loss to Jelena Janković at the Sydney International. At the Australian Open, Mauresmo lost in the fourth round to Lucie Šafářová, 4–6, 3–6, after winning her first three matches in straight sets.
Mauresmo&#x27;s next tournament was the Open Gaz de France, where she lost in the semifinals to Nadia Petrova, 7–5, 4–6, 6–7, after Mauresmo led 4–1 in the final set and had a match point in the tiebreak. This was Mauresmo&#x27;s third loss in the last four matches with Petrova. In her next tournament at the Proximus Diamond Games in Antwerp, Mauresmo defeated Kim Clijsters in the final. This was Mauresmo&#x27;s third consecutive title there, earning her the diamond-encrusted racquet that comes with winning the title at least three times in five years. The trophy cost US$1.3 million. Mauresmo then played the Dubai Open, where she lost to Justine Henin in the final.

On 16 March 2007, Mauresmo received the Chevalier of the Légion d&#x27;honneur from President Jacques Chirac.

Mauresmo was scheduled to play the Miami Open but was forced to withdraw because of acute appendicitis. She also withdrew from the Bausch &amp; Lomb Championships in Amelia Island, Florida, for the same reason. Although she had resumed training, she was not fit enough to compete at the J &amp; S Cup in Warsaw, Poland.

At the German Open in Berlin, Mauresmo lost in the third round to Julia Vakulenko of Ukraine, and at the Rome Masters, she lost in the second round to Samantha Stosur, 7–5, 7–6, 6–7, after Mauresmo led 5–3 in the third set. Going into the French Open, Mauresmo had played only three tournaments since the end of February. Mauresmo lost to Czech Lucie Šafářová in the third round, 3–6, 6–7, committing eight double faults and 49 unforced errors.

After losing to Henin in the final of the International Women&#x27;s Open in Eastbourne, 5–7, 7–6, 6–7, after being up 4–1 in the deciding set, defending champion Mauresmo went into Wimbledon saying that she was ready to win another major title. However, she lost her fourth-round match against Czech teen Nicole Vaidišová, 6–7, 6–4, 1–6. The loss dropped her to world No. 6, her first time outside the top five since November 2003.

Mauresmo withdrew from the US Open, because of a lack of fitness.

She made her return to the tour at the China Open in Beijing. However, she lost in the quarterfinals to home-crowd favourite Peng Shuai. She then entered the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix, where she lost to Elena Dementieva in straight sets. At the Kremlin Cup in Moscow, Mauresmo lost in the first round to Vera Zvonareva. In Zürich, Mauresmo lost in the second round to Alona Bondarenko in three sets.

Mauresmo left Dunlop for HEAD racquets. The partnership was to run through 2010.

===2008: Shadow of the champion===

Her first tournament of the year was the Tier III Australian Hardcourts in Gold Coast, where she lost in the quarterfinals to fourth-seeded Patty Schnyder. At the Australian Open in Melbourne, Mauresmo lost in the third round to Casey Dellacqua, 6–3, 4–6, 4–6.

At her next tournament, the Tier II Open Gaz de France in Paris, Mauresmo lost in the quarterfinals to Anna Chakvetadze, 6–3, 3–6, 3–6.

Mauresmo played both tournaments in the Middle East. At the Tier I Qatar Open, she lost in the second round to Tamarine Tanasugarn, 6–7, 5–7. At the Tier II Dubai Tennis Championships, Mauresmo reached her third quarterfinal of the year but was unable to hold off the second seed and eventual finalist Svetlana Kuznetsova, losing 1–6, 6–7.

Mauresmo then lost in the third round of Tier-I events, the Pacific Life Open in Indian Wells and the Miami Open in Key Biscayne.

On clay at the Bausch &amp; Lomb Championships in Amelia Island, Mauresmo lost in the quarterfinals to eventual runner-up Dominika Cibulková.

At the French Open, Mauresmo lost in the second round to Spanish qualifier Carla Suárez Navarro, 3–6, 4–6.

At the Eastbourne International, Mauresmo defeated sixth-seeded French woman Alizé Cornet in the first round, 6–1, 4–6, 7–5, but lost in the second round after retiring due to injury from her match with Sam Stosur while Mauresmo was leading 2–1.

At Wimbledon, Mauresmo lost in the third round to two-time former champion Serena Williams, 6–7, 1–6. Hampered by a thigh injury, Mauresmo trailed 5–0 in the second set before breaking Williams&#x27;s serve, only to be broken herself in the next game and lose the match. Mauresmo said after the match, &quot;I was not 100% in my movement but overall I thought there were some good moments in the first set. But I really started to feel the injury in the tiebreak, and I&#x27;m not going to talk about the second set.&quot;

Mauresmo declined the nomination by the French Tennis Federation to play in the Olympic Games after Mary Pierce withdrew. Pauline Parmentier was then nominated.

Mauresmo, after a two-month hiatus from tennis due to a thigh injury sustained at Wimbledon, lost in the semifinals of the Cincinnati Open to Nathalie Dechy, 4–6, 6–3, 2–6. After the match, Mauresmo, sounding optimistic about her chances at the upcoming US Open, said &quot;I got four matches in this week, which is what I was looking for. It would have been great to play five but I&#x27;ll go to New Haven (Connecticut) hoping to find a little more rhythm and build-up to the US Open.&quot; Mauresmo then lost in the semifinals of the Pilot Pen Tennis tournament (in New Haven) to top-seeded Chakvetadze 3–6, 6–3, 1–6. At the US Open, Mauresmo lost in the fourth round to 16th-seeded Flavia Pennetta 3–6, 0–6.

She ended her year with a quarterfinal result at Luxembourg, losing to eventual champion Elena Dementieva. Mauresmo ended the year ranked world No. 24, with a singles record of 32–19.

===2009: Final year and retirement===

At the Brisbane International tournament, Mauresmo defeated world no. 177 Jelena Dokić in the first round, 7–6, 7–6, before defeating French compatriot Julie Coin in the second round, 5–7, 6–2, 7–6 in 3 hours, 14 minutes. The fifth-seeded Mauresmo then defeated top-seeded Ana Ivanovic in the quarterfinals, before retiring in her semifinal match against third-seeded Marion Bartoli, while trailing 0–4 in the first set. At the Australian Open, Mauresmo lost in the third round to Victoria Azarenka.

Mauresmo won her first tournament since 2007 by defeating Elena Dementieva in the final of the Open Gaz de France tournament in Paris.

Mauresmo lost in the third round of the Indian Wells Open in California, the first Premier Mandatory event of the year, to Li Na, 5–7, 2–6. The next event on the WTA Tour was another Premier Mandatory tournament at Key Biscayne. Mauresmo was seeded 20th there and lost in the fourth round to unseeded Sam Stosur, 4–6, 4–6, but ended up winning the doubles event with her tennis partner Svetlana Kuznetsova, after ousting the world champions on their way to the cup.

At the Madrid Masters, Mauresmo defeated Zheng Jie in the second round, 6–2, 7–5. She then came from behind to defeat Elena Dementieva, 1–6, 6–4, 6–2, and Ágnes Szávay, 5–7, 6–1, 6–1, in the third round and quarterfinal respectively.

Mauresmo lost against Anna-Lena Grönefeld, 4–6, 3–6, in the first round of the French Open.

Mauresmo was the 17th seed at the 2009 Wimbledon Championships. She opened with a 6–1, 4–6, 6–2 win over Melinda Czink. She then defeated Kristína Kučová and Flavia Pennetta. Her fourth-round match against the first seed Dinara Safina became a part of tennis history as it was the first competitive match in which the new, multimillion-pound roof closed due to rain. Mauresmo went on to lose the match, 6–4, 3–6, 4–6.

At the 2009 US Open, Mauresmo was the 17th seed but lost to unseeded Aleksandra Wozniak, 4–6, 0–6, in the second round.

Mauresmo announced at a press conference on 8 October 2009 that she was considering retiring from tennis. On 3 December 2009, she officially announced her retirement at a press conference in Paris. She ended her career ranked world No. 21.

==Coaching career==
===2010–2011===
In June and July 2010, Mauresmo temporarily coached fellow French player Michaël Llodra during the grass season.
On 7 November, Mauresmo ran her first marathon at the 2010 New York City Marathon, finishing 3hr: 40m: 20s.

At the 2011 French Open, Mauresmo was set to be reunited with Llodra, making her professional return in the mixed doubles competition, but was disqualified before competing, as she had not re-registered for the anti-doping procedures required to compete on the tour.

===2012===
In 2012, Mauresmo joined forces with 2012 Australian Open champion and then-world No. 1, Victoria Azarenka, and her team as a support coach to help the Belarusian in defending her world No. 1 ranking and launching an assault on the remaining three Grand Slams of 2012 and the 2012 Olympics.

===2013===
In 2013, Mauresmo started coaching French No. 1, Marion Bartoli, joining forces with her shortly before the 2013 Wimbledon Championships. Under her tutelage, Bartoli would win her first Grand Slam title there without dropping a set (or even playing a tiebreak set), and credited her for her career revival (entering these Championships, Bartoli had yet to even reach a semi-final in 2013).

===2014–2016===
On 8 June 2014, Mauresmo was announced as the new coach of Andy Murray. In December 2014, the FFT announced that it was extending Mauresmo&#x27;s Fed Cup contract for another two years. Under her coaching Murray reached the 2015 Australian Open final but he lost to Novak Djokovic in four sets. In May 2015, Mauresmo oversaw Murray&#x27;s first career titles on clay, including the 2015 Madrid Open, which culminated in a first-ever clay-court victory over Rafael Nadal. Murray also reached the semi-finals of the French Open and Wimbledon. Mauresmo gave birth to a son in August 2015, and was on maternity leave after Wimbledon until late in the year, with Murray coached by Jonas Björkman in Mauresmo&#x27;s absence. In 2016, Mauresmo was back coaching Murray as he reached his fifth Australian Open final before losing to Djokovic in straight sets. Murray reached a semi-final at Monte Carlo where he lost to Nadal. Mauresmo&#x27;s last tournament as Murray&#x27;s coach was the 2016 Madrid Open, where Murray beat Nadal in the semi-final but then lost a close final to Djokovic. The next day, 9 May 2016, Mauresmo announced in Rome that she had stepped down as Murray&#x27;s coach.

Simultaneously, she had captained the France Fed Cup team since 2013. After the 2016 final, which they lost to the Czech Republic, she announced she was quitting that post due to her second pregnancy.

===2018===
In June 2018, she was appointed captain of the France Davis Cup team for the following season. Nevertheless, she never came to fulfill this position, since at the end of the year she renounced in order to coach French player Lucas Pouille during the 2019 season.

===2019===
Under Mauresmo&#x27;s coaching, Pouille, who had never previously won a match at the Australian Open, reached the semifinals of the 2019 edition, where he lost to eventual champion Novak Djokovic. Mauresmo and 
Pouille parted ways in October 2020, largely influenced by the changes in the tennis world and beyond following the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Playing style==
Mauresmo was an aggressive player with an all-court game, who was noted for her technical mastery. Her strongest groundstroke was her one-handed backhand, which was one of the most effective on the WTA tour. Mauresmo could hit her backhand flat and with depth, with topspin, or with slice; her backhand was responsible for most of the winners she accumulated on court. Her forehand was more erratic, and players acquainted with Mauresmo&#x27;s game would hit relentlessly to her forehand to try to force an error. Throughout her career, however, Mauresmo made improvements to her forehand, and, by 2005, it became a stroke she utilised more frequently and with more success. Her serve was powerful, with her first serve averaging , and being recorded as high as , enabling her to serve aces regularly. A reliable second serves, typically delivered at , meant that double faults were uncommon. Mauresmo was one of the strongest net players on the WTA Tour, and would frequently choose to finish points at the net. An exceptional volleyer, she had deft touch at the net and had a complete repertoire of shots to perform there. Although not a net-rusher like Martina Navratilova or Billie Jean King, Mauresmo was a proficient serve and volleyer; this tactic was especially effective on grass courts. She was an aggressive returner, standing on the baseline to receive first serves, neutralising them effectively with a backhand down-the-line or an inside-out forehand. She would stand several feet within the baseline to receive second serves and could hit return winners frequently. Despite her exceptional skill, Mauresmo&#x27;s greatest weakness was her lack of confidence, nerves, and inconsistency; these were discussed at length by the media throughout her career. Mauresmo&#x27;s game was effective on all surfaces, and she won tournaments on all four surfaces.

==Performance at Grand Slam tournaments==
Although Mauresmo had been one of the top singles players for several years, she did not have success in winning Grand Slam tournaments until 2006. Mauresmo was criticized for her mental strength after succumbing to nerves in those events. In consecutive Wimbledon semifinals, she lost to Serena Williams and Lindsay Davenport after leading comfortably. Before her 2006 Australian Open title, Mauresmo was often touted as &quot;the greatest women&#x27;s player never to win a Grand Slam.&quot; After winning the 2006 Wimbledon title, Mauresmo openly joked, &quot;I don&#x27;t want anyone to talk about my nerves anymore.&quot;

Mauresmo is one of several tennis players, male or female, to have reached the top ranking without first winning a Grand Slam singles title. Other players who had done so were Kim Clijsters, Ivan Lendl, Marcelo Ríos, Jelena Janković, Dinara Safina, Caroline Wozniacki, Karolina Pliskova and Simona Halep.

==Personal life==
On 16 August 2015, Mauresmo announced that she had given birth to a baby boy named Aaron. She gave birth to her daughter, Ayla, on 26 April 2017.

Mauresmo was one of the final torch runners at the 2024 Summer Olympics opening ceremony.

==Equipment and endorsements==
Mauresmo&#x27;s apparel and footwear on court was manufactured by Nike, and later Reebok. In the early 2000s, she used Dunlop 200G+1.00 racquet.
