<text>The Tupolev Tu-104 (NATO reporting name: Camel) is a medium-range, narrow-body, twin turbojet-powered Soviet airliner. It was the second to enter regular service, behind the British de Havilland Comet and was the only jetliner operating in the world from 1956 to 1958, when the British jetliner was grounded due to safety concerns.

In 1957, Czechoslovak Airlines – ČSA (now Czech Airlines), became the first airline in the world to fly a route exclusively with jet airliners, using the Tu-104A variant between Prague and Moscow. In civilian service, the Tu-104 carried over 90 million passengers with Aeroflot (then the world&#x27;s largest airline), and a lesser number with ČSA, while it also was operated by the Soviet Air Force. Its successors included the Tu-124, Tu-134, and Tu-154.

==Design and development==
At the beginning of the 1950s, the Soviet Union&#x27;s Aeroflot airline needed a modern airliner with better capacity and performance than the piston-engined aircraft then in operation. The design request was filled by the Tupolev OKB, which based their new airliner on its Tu-16 &quot;Badger&quot; strategic bomber. The wings, engines, and tail surfaces of the Tu-16 were retained with the airliner, but the new design adopted a wider, pressurised fuselage designed to accommodate 50 passengers. The prototype build in MMZ &#x27;Opit&#x27; first flew on June 17, 1955, with Yu.L. Alasheyev at the controls. It was fitted with a drag parachute to shorten the landing distance by up to , since at the time, not many airports had sufficiently long runways. The first serial TU-104 took off on 5 November 1955.

The Tu-104 was powered by two Mikulin AM-3 turbojets placed in the wing roots (resembling the configuration of the de Havilland Comet). The crew consisted of two pilots, a navigator (seated in the glazed &quot;bomber&quot; nose), a flight engineer, and a radio operator (later eliminated). The airplane raised great curiosity by its lavish &quot;Victorian&quot; interior – so-called by some Western observers – due to the materials used: mahogany, copper, and lace.

Tu-104 pilots were trained on the Ilyushin Il-28 bomber, followed by mail flights on an unarmed Tu-16 bomber painted in Aeroflot colors, between Moscow and Sverdlovsk. Pilots with previous Tu-16 experience transitioned into the Tu-104 with relative ease. The Tu-104 was considered difficult to fly, as it was heavy on controls and quite fast on final approach, and at low speeds displayed a tendency to stall, a feature common with highly swept wings.
Experience with the Tu-104 led the Tupolev Design Bureau to develop the world&#x27;s first turbofan series-built airliner, the Tupolev Tu-124, designed for local markets, and subsequently the more commercially successful Tu-134.

==Operational history==
On 15 September 1956, the Tu-104 began revenue service on Aeroflot&#x27;s Moscow-Omsk-Irkutsk route, replacing the Ilyushin Il-14. The flight time was reduced from 13 hours and 50 minutes to 7 hours and 40 minutes, and the new jet dramatically increased the level of passenger comfort. By 1957, Aeroflot had placed the Tu-104 in service on routes from Vnukovo Airport in Moscow to London, Budapest, Copenhagen, Beijing, Brussels, Ottawa, Delhi, and Prague.

In 1957, ČSA Czechoslovak Airlines became the only export customer for the Tu-104, placing the aircraft on routes to Moscow, Paris, and Brussels. ČSA bought six Tu-104As (four new and two used aircraft) configured for 81 passengers. Three of these were subsequently written off (one due to a refueling incident in India and another to a pilot error without fatalities).

In 1959, a Tu-104 was leased to Sir Henry Lunn Ltd. (Lunn Poly) of London, who used the aircraft to transport holiday-makers to Russia with a 4.5-hour flight time.

Whilst the Tu-104 continued to be used by Aeroflot throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the safety record of the aircraft was poor in comparison to Western jetliners (16 of 96 aircraft were lost in accidents). The Tu-104 was unreliable, heavy, and very unstable with poor control response and an inclination to Dutch roll. Poor design aerodynamics of the wings resulted in a propensity to stall with little or no warning and a dangerous tendency to pitch up violently before stalling and entering an irrecoverable dive. Due to the fear of inadvertent stalls, aircrew flew approaches above the recommended approach speed, landing at , nearly faster. At least two accidents were attributed to the pitch-up phenomenon, prompting changes to the design of the aircraft and operating procedures, but the problem remained. Aeroflot retired the Tu-104 from civilian service in March 1979 following a fatal accident at Moscow, but several aircraft were transferred to the Soviet military, which used them as staff transports and to train cosmonauts in zero gravity. After a military Tu-104 crash in February 1981 killed 50 people (17 were senior army and naval staff), the type was permanently removed from service. The last flight of the Tu-104 was a ferry flight to Ulyanovsk Aircraft Museum on 11 November 1986.

==Variants==
&quot;Data from:&quot; 

* Tu-104 – The initial version seating 50 passengers, it used two Mikulin AM-3 turbojet engines, each with of thrust; 29 airframes were built.
* Tu-104 2NK-8 – Proposed version, it was to be powered by two Kuznetsov NK-8 turbofan engines.
* Tu-104A – An improved version appearing in June 1957, its continued improvements of the Mikulin engines (Mikulin AM-3M each with of thrust) permitted significant growth in capacity, resulting in a 70-seater variant. The Tu-104A became the definitive production variant. On 6 September 1957, it flew with 20 t of payload at above mean sea level. On 24 September 1957, it reached average speed with a 2-tonne payload. In total, 80 airframes were built, of which six were exported to Czechoslovakia.
* Tu-104AK – A testbed aircraft, it was used for zero-g cosmonauts&#x27; training and testing the Soviet space program equipment.
* Tu-104A-TS – Five Tu-104As converted to freighter/medevac aircraft.
* Tu-104B – Further improvements were made by stretching the fuselage and fitting new Mikulin AM-3M-500 turbojets engines ( of thrust each). The Tu-104B was able to accommodate 100 passengers. This variant took advantage of the newer fuselage from the Tu-110 and the existing wings. It began revenue service with Aeroflot on 15 April 1959 on the Moscow-Saint Petersburg route; 95 airframes were built. Most were later rebuilt to Tu-104V-115 standard.
* Tu-104B-TS – Six Tu-104Bs converted to freighter/medevac aircraft.
* Tu-104 CSA - Six aircraft built for CSA.
* Tu-104D – This VIP version had two sleeper cabins forward and a 39-seat cabin aft.
* Tu-104D-85 – Tu-104A airframes rebuilt to accommodate 85 passengers.
* Tu-104D 3NK-8 – Project powered by three NK-8 engines, precursor of Tu-154.
* Tu-104E – A higher performance Tu-104 powered by RD-16-15 engines, giving better fuel economy and greater thrust. Two prototypes were converted from Tu-104Bs СССР-42441 and СССР-42443. The program was cancelled in the mid-1960s in favor of the Tu-154.
* Tu-104G – This VIP version was for the federal government, with two VIP cabins forward and a 54-seat cabin aft.
* Tu-104LL – Several serial numbers were converted for use in testing Tu-129 and Tu-22M electronics, and air-to-air missile systems (including launch).
* Tu-104Sh – Navigator trainer in two versions.
* Tu-104V – The first use of this designation was for a projected 117-seat, medium-haul version with six-abreast seating; project cancelled.
* Tu-104V – The second use of this designation was used for Tu-104A airframes rebuilt to accommodate 100 or 105 passengers. A later version packed 115 passengers in by reducing seat pitch and adding seat rows.
*Tu-104V-115 – Tu-104B airframes were rebuilt to accommodate 115 passengers, with new radio and navigational equipment.
* Tu-107 – Prototype military transport version, with a rear loading ramp and a defensive turret armed with paired cannon. Although one aircraft was built, no production followed.
* Tu-110 – A four-engined version intended for export. A number of prototypes were built before the project was cancelled.
* Tu-118 – A projected turboprop freighter version powered by four Kuznetsov TV-2F engines.

==Accidents and incidents==
According to the American Flight Safety Foundation, between 1958 and 1981, 16 Tu-104s were lost in crashes out of 37 aircraft written off (hull loss rate = 18%) with a total of 1140 fatalities.

===1950s===
;19 February 1958
:An Aeroflot Tu-104 (СССР-Л5414) was being ferried from Sverdlovsk (now Yekaterinburg) to Moscow when it force-landed short of the runway at Savasleika Air Base due to fuel exhaustion; all three crew survived.

;15 August 1958
:Aeroflot Flight 04, a Tu-104A (СССР-Л5442), stalled, spun down and crashed in the Khabarovsky District, Khabarovsk Krai after entering an updraft at , killing all 64 on board in the first fatal accident involving the Tu-104. Later accidents showed that the Tu-104 was prone to losing longitudinal stability when flying in certain atmospheric conditions.

;17 October 1958
:An Aeroflot Tu-104A (СССР-42362) pitched up, entered a dive, spun down and crashed near Kanash after encountering turbulence and an updraft, killing all 80 on board. The aircraft was flying high-level diplomats of several Soviet-aligned countries to Moscow for an official event. In the wake of this accident, the Tu-104 was limited to and the stabilizers were redesigned.

===1960s===
;20 October 1960
:Aeroflot Flight 05, a Tu-104A (СССР-42452), struck sloping terrain near Ust-Orda while attempting to climb following an aborted approach after the nosegear light malfunctioned, killing the 3 pilots of 68 on board.

;1 February 1961
:An Aeroflot Tu-104A (СССР-42357) overran the runway on landing at Vladivostok Airport after landing too late; no casualties.

;16 March 1961
:Aeroflot Flight 068, a Tu-104B (СССР-42438) force-landed on the frozen Nizhneisetsky pond near Koltsovo Airport following double engine failure, killing five of 51 on board. Shortly after takeoff, the right engine failed, causing severe vibration of the fuselage. Because of the vibration, the crew could not determine which engine failed as they could not read the instruments. A crew member pulled back the throttle for the left engine in an attempt to hear the difference in engine power to determine which engine failed, but the engine was shut down by mistake. A loss of altitude resulted, and a forced landing was carried out. The aircraft also struck a house near the pond, killing two. The engine failure was caused by a broken turbine blade in the second stage of the turbine section.

;10 July 1961
:Aeroflot Flight 381, a Tu-104B (СССР-42447), crashed at Odessa-Central Airport in bad weather after encountering downdrafts during the approach, killing one of 94 on board.

;17 September 1961
:An Aeroflot Tu-104A (СССР-42388) was written off following a heavy landing at Tashkent Airport; no casualties.

;2 November 1961
:An Aeroflot Tu-104B (СССР-42504) force-landed in a field near Vladivostok Airport due to engine failure after striking a radio antenna during the approach; no casualties.

;4 June 1962
:An Aeroflot Tu-104B (СССР-42491) struck the side of Mount Baba (19 mi northeast of Vrazhdebna Airport) while attempting to return to Sofia following engine failure, killing the five crew.

;30 June 1962
:Aeroflot Flight 902, a Tu-104A (СССР-42370), was shot down by an errant anti-aircraft missile and crashed in the Beryozovsky District, killing all 84 on board. The missile was fired during an air defense exercise in the Magansk area, but it had lost its target in a storm front and hit the Tu-104 instead.

;3 September 1962
:Aeroflot Flight 03, a Tu-104A (СССР-42366), crashed in a swamp near Kuruna, Nanaysky District following an unexplained loss of control, killing all 86 on board; autopilot problems were blamed. An accidental shootdown was also theorized.

;25 October 1962
:An Aeroflot Tu-104B (СССР-42495) crashed shortly after takeoff from Sheremetyevo Airport during a post-maintenance test flight, killing all 11 on board. The rudder controls had been connected backwards.

;18 May 1963
:An Aeroflot Tu-104B (СССР-42483) stalled and crashed while on approach to Smolnoye Airport; no casualties.

;13 July 1963
:Aeroflot Flight 012, a Tu-104B (СССР-42492), crashed short of the runway at Irkutsk Airport following a sudden, sharp descent during the approach, killing 33 of 35 on board. Water had entered wiring, causing incorrect readings of horizontal and vertical speed and altitude instruments.

;16 August 1963
:A CSA Czechoslovak Airlines Tu-104A (OK-LDB) burned out during refueling at Santa Cruz Airport; one flight attendant was injured while jumping from the plane, but there were no other casualties.

;9 June 1964
:Aeroflot Flight 35, a Tu-104B (СССР-42476), landed hard at Tolmachevo Airport while attempting an overshoot; no casualties.

;28 April 1969
:An Aeroflot Tu-104B (СССР-42436) was written off after it landed short of the runway at Irkutsk Airport; no casualties.

===1970s===
;1 June 1970
:A CSA Czechoslovak Airlines Tu-104A (OK-NDD) crashed short of runway 36 at Tripoli International Airport after two missed approaches to runway 18, killing all 13 on board.

;25 July 1971
:Aeroflot Flight 1912, a Tu-104B (СССР-42405), crashed following a hard landing short of the runway at Irkutsk Airport after the aircraft pitched up due to a too low approach speed, killing 97 of 126 on board. The speed indicator reading was affected by cabin pressurization and may have overstated the aircraft&#x27;s speed.

;10 October 1971
:Aeroflot Flight 773, a Tu-104B (СССР-42490), exploded in mid-air and crashed near Baranovo, Naro-Fominsky District after a bomb placed in the cabin detonated, killing all 25 on board.

:An Aeroflot Tu-104B (СССР-42408) crashed after it struck a snow wall short of the runway at Omsk Airport during its fifth attempt to land; no casualties.

;24 April 1973
:Aeroflot Flight 2420, a Tu-104B (СССР-42505), was hijacked by a passenger who demanded to be flown to Stockholm, Sweden. The crew returned to Leningrad and while the landing gear was lowered the hijacker set off a bomb, killing himself and the flight engineer. Although the explosion blew a hole in the right side of the fuselage, the aircraft was able to land safely with no other casualties.

;18 May 1973
:Aeroflot Flight 109, a Tu-104A (СССР-42379), was hijacked by Chingis Yunusogly Rzayev and demanded to be flown to China. When Rzayev attempted to enter the cockpit he was shot by security officer Vladimir Yezikov. Though mortally wounded, Rzayev managed to detonate a bomb he had with him, consisting of of TNT, blowing the aircraft out of the sky and it crashed in the Buryat ASSR, killing all 81 on board.

;29 August 1973
:CSA Flight 531, a Tu-104A (OK-MDE), veered off the runway on landing at Nicosia Airport after the pilot failed to stop the aircraft in time; all 70 on board survived. Wreckage remains at the crash site.

;30 September 1973
:Aeroflot Flight 3932, a Tu-104B (СССР-42506), crashed shortly after takeoff from Koltsovo Airport after the artificial horizons lost power, killing all 108 on board.

;13 October 1973
:Aeroflot Flight 964, a Tu-104B (СССР-42486), crashed 10 mi northwest of Domodedovo Airport after the compass and main gyroscopes lost power, killing all 122 in the deadliest accident involving the Tu-104.

<doc id="229912" wikidata="Q629025" url="?curid=229912" title="Rail transport in Switzerland">
<text>Rail transport in Switzerland is noteworthy for the density of its network, its coordination between services, its integration with other modes of transport, timeliness and a thriving domestic and trans-Alp freight system. It is made necessary by strong regulations on truck transport, and is enabled by properly coordinated intermodal logistics.
With network length, Switzerland has a dense railway network, and is the clear European leader in kilometres traveled: per inhabitant and year (2019). Worldwide, only the Japanese travel more by train. 

Virtually 100% of its network is electrified, except for the few tracks on which steam locomotives operate for tourism purposes only. There are 74 railway companies in Switzerland. The share of commuters who travel to work using public transport (as the primary mode of transport) is 30%. The share of rail in goods transport performance by road and rail (modal split) is 39%.

Switzerland was ranked first among national European rail systems in the 2017 European Railway Performance Index for its intensity of use, quality of service and strong safety rating. Switzerland had excellent intensity of use, notably driven by passenger traffic, a good rating for quality of service, and an excellent rating for safety. Switzerland captured high value in return for public investment with cost to performance ratios that outperform the average ratio for all European countries.

Passenger trains have two travel classes: 1st class, sometimes with larger windows (e.g. in the Gotthard Panorama Express), and 2nd class. Long-distance trains feature an on-board restaurant (or at least a vending machine) in the middle of the train and sometimes a &quot;kids area&quot; at one end of the train. Rail and most other modes of public transport operate under clock-face scheduling. There is a national integrated ticketing system for rail, bus and other modes of transport, grouped in tariff networks. The &quot;Swiss Travel Pass&quot; facilitates travel by train, bus and boat for tourists.

Switzerland is a member of the International Union of Railways (UIC). The UIC Country Code for Switzerland is 85.

==Standard-gauge railways==

Three quarters of the Swiss rail network is at standard-gauge, comprising , administered mostly by three companies. Important railway stations are the Zürich HB (398,300 passengers per day in 2023), Bern (175,400 ppd), Lucerne (99,400 ppd), Winterthur (99,100 ppd), Basel SBB (98,600 ppd), Lausanne (96,700 ppd), Zürich Oerlikon (82,200 ppd), and Geneva (79,500 ppd). The main operators of the standard gauge railway lines are Swiss Federal Railways (SBB CFF FFS), BLS, and Südostbahn (SOB). Other standard gauge operators are CJ, SZU, TPF and TransN.

=== Swiss Federal Railways===

Swiss Federal Railways (, , ) is the largest railway company in Switzerland and handles most of national and international traffic. It operates the central east–west track in the Swiss Plateau area serving all larger Swiss cities and many smaller ones, and the north–south routes through the Alps via the Gotthard Line through the Gotthard Base Tunnel (Milano-Chiasso-Lugano-Luzern/Zurich-Basel line) and the Simplon Tunnel (Domodossola to Brig-Lausanne-Geneva line). It operates most long-distance services, including EuroCity (EC), InterCity (IC, domestic only), InterRegio (IR) and RegioExpress (RE) services. SBB and its subsidiaries (e.g. Thurbo, RegionAlps) also runs many Regio (R) and S-Bahn (S) lines. Its subidiary SBB GmbH operates regional trains serving stations in Germany, including two lines located entirely in Germany, near the border with Switzerland. SBB Cargo handels freight operations.

*&quot;Total route length:&quot; .

=== BLS===

The BLS AG (short for Bern-Lötschberg-Simplon) operates 10% of the Swiss standard-gauge network. It manages the second major Alpine route (Bern-Brig), via both Lötschberg tunnels (base and summit) and connection at with SBB&#x27;s Simplon Tunnel to Italy. BLS operates InterRegio (IR), RegioExpress (RE, one service extends to Italy) and Regio (R) services. It also operates S-Bahn (S) trains for Bern S-Bahn and Lucerne S-Bahn. Freight trains are operated by its subsidiary BLS Cargo.

*&quot;Total route length:&quot; .

=== SOB===

The &quot;Schweizerische Südostbahn AG&quot; (SOB) owns railway lines in Central and Eastern Switzerland. It operates services over its own network and lines owned by SBB, partly as joint-ventures. Since the early 1990s, it operates a long-distance service between ( until 2013) and under the name &quot;Voralpen Express&quot;. This InterRegio (IR) service runs hourly via Herisau, the main town of the canton of Appenzell Ausserrhoden, the Toggenburg valley, the lakeside dam on Lake Zurich, the high moorland of Rothenthurm, Lake Zug and Lake Lucerne. Since 2020, the SOB also operates the &quot;Treno Gottardo&quot; over the old Gotthard railway between / and , and since 2021 the &quot;Aare Linth&quot; between and (both are IR services). SOB also runs some S-Bahn (S) services of Lucerne S-Bahn, St. Gallen S-Bahn and Zurich S-Bahn.

*&quot;Total route length:&quot; , of which are their own.

===Rail links to other countries===

*Standard gauge 
** Austria – same voltage 15 kV, 16.7 Hz AC
** France – voltage change 15 kV, 16.7 Hz AC / 25 kV, 50 Hz AC or 1,500 V DC
** Germany – same voltage 15 kV, 16.7 Hz AC
** Italy – voltage change 15 kV, 16.7 Hz AC / 3 kV DC
** Liechtenstein – same voltage 15 kV, 16.7 Hz AC

Although Austria, Germany and Liechtenstein all use the same voltage as Switzerland, dedicated types of locomotives are necessary due to Switzerland using narrower pantographs.

;Germany
Several railway lines cross the Germany–Switzerland border. The most important one is the Mannheim–Basel line, which links stations in Germany with Basel Badischer Bahnhof in the Swiss city of Basel. This station is also the western terminus of the High Rhine Railway, which runs east–west along the High Rhine and across the Swiss canton of Schaffhausen, and of the Wiese Valley Railway to . Stations along these lines, including those in Switzerland, are owned by the German BEV, except Schaffhausen railway station, which is jointly owned with Swiss Federal Railways (SBB). Other cross-border lines include the Eglisau–Neuhausen railway, corresponding to the shortest route between and Schaffhausen, which passes over German territory with two active railway stations (, ), both owend and operaded by SBB (and its subsidiary Thurbo). Another railway line connects the border stations of (Switzerland) and (Germany) via a bridge over the High Rhine. A loop of the Lake Line links Switzerland with the German border city of Konstanz on Lake Constance. Another railway line, the Etzwilen–Singen railway, is only used by heritage trains.

Deutsche Bahn (DB) operates long-distance trains from Germany to Swiss cities, including Intercity-Express (ICE) services to , Zürich HB, , and . DB also operates an InterCity (IC) service between Zürich HB and , and an Interregio-Express (IRE) over the High Rhine line between Basel Badischer Bahnhof and . On the other hand, SBB runs EuroCity (EC) services between Zurich HB and , via in Austria. There is also one InterRegio (IR) line and one RegioExpress (RE) line with as their terminus. SBB GmbH, SBB&#x27;s German subsidiary, also operates a regional line, named the &quot;Seehas&quot;, and one line of Basel S-Bahn entirely on German territory close to the Swiss border. 

;France
There are a few railway lines crossing the France–Switzerland border, the most-frequented ones being the Lyon–Geneva railway and the Strasbourg–Basel railway lines. TGV Lyria, a joint-venture between SBB and the French SNCF, operates high-speed trains from Paris or southern France to and or Basel SBB and Zurich HB. Some RegioExpress (RE) trains of SBB also connect with stations in France. The Léman Express is a commuter rail system linking Geneva with stations in Switzerland and France. Some cross-border regional trains services are provided by TER.

;Austria and Liechtenstein
Only one standard gauge railway line crosses the Austria–Switzerland border, the St. Margrethen–Lauterach line, while another one, the Feldkirch–Buchs railway line, connects the two countries via the Principality of Liechtenstein. Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB) operates the Railjet and the &quot;Transalpin&quot; (a EC service) between Zurich HB and several destinations in Austria. The services run via and through Liechtenstein (without stopping) to either Wien Hbf or Graz Hbf and call, among others, at Innsbruck Hbf and Salzburg Hbf. The other line is used by EC trains (Zürich–Munich) and regional trains of Bodensee S-Bahn.

Rail transport to Liechtenstein is provided by Vorarlberg S-Bahn, operated by ÖBB. There are also bus links between Swiss railway stations and Liechtenstein.

;Italy
The main railway lines linking Switzerland with Italy are the Gotthard railway and the Simplon railway. SBB and the Italian Trenitalia jointly operate EC services across the Italy–Switzerland border. These services run between and or even via the Simplon Tunnel. Between Basel and Milan via Bern and the Lötschberg Base and Simplon Tunnels, and between Zurich HB and Milan via the Gotthard route. These routes were previously operated by &quot;Cisalpino&quot;. Other standard-gauge lines crossing the border are operated by regional trains of TILO.

;Night trains
There are also EuroNight (EN) services between Switzerland and other European countries. The Austrian ÖBB operates Nightjet (NJ) trains between Swiss and Austrian and German destinations.

==Narrow-gauge railways==

Due to lack of space, the trains partly run on the street or right next to it.
===RhB and MGB===

The Rhätische Bahn (RhB), , is the longest metre-gauge railway network in Switzerland. Located in the eastern Swiss Alps, it links Arosa, Disentis, Davos and St. Moritz with Chur in the canton of Grisons (). One line, operated by the Bernina Express (a Panorama Express, PE), crosses the Italy–Switzerland border to Tirano in the Valtellina valley. The Bernina Pass is the highest point on this line, at an altitude of . It is also the highest rail crossing in Europe. and are RhB&#x27;s rail junctions with the Swiss Federal Railways&#x27; standard gauge network. RhB&#x27;s lines pass through the Landquart, Vorderrhein and upper Alpine Rhine valleys and several side valleys, as well as the Engadine, the upper valley of the river Inn. The network has a total length of . 

The Matterhorn Gotthard Bahn (MGB), , was founded in 2003 through the merger of the &quot;Furka Oberalp Bahn&quot; (FO) with the &quot;Brig–Zermatt Bahn&quot; (BVZ; BVZ means Brig–Visp–Zermatt). The former &quot;Furka Oberalp Bahn&quot; was a metre-gauge railway in the high southern Alps. Its name refers to two passes, the Furka Pass and the Oberalp Pass. The Furka Pass lies at the upper end of the Rhône valley. The Oberalp Pass is the highest point on this line at above sea level, and lies at the upper end of the Rhine valley. The line runs from to . At , the line connects with the former &quot;Schöllenenbahn&quot; to on the standard gauge Gotthard Railway of Swiss Federal Railways. Brig in the canton of Valais is a rail junction with standard gauge lines of Swiss Federal Railways and BLS. It sits at the north end of the Simplon Tunnel on the Milan–Lausanne line and Milan–Bern line. The total length of the FO railway was . The former &quot;Brig–Zermatt Bahn&quot; was a short line between Brig and . It passes through the valleys of the Vispa and Matter Vispa, tributaries of the Rhône. The total length of the BVZ line was .

The &quot;Glacier Express&quot; (GEX), a Panorama Express (PE), runs on the combined route, using lines of RhB and MGB ( - - - - - - - ). A one-day trip in panoramic-view cars takes tourists from St. Moritz to Zermatt, or vice versa, through some of the most spectacular scenery of the Alps. It is the longest long-distance train service in Switzerland. The journey from Zermatt to St. Moritz takes about 8 hours.

===Further narrow-gauge railways===
;Eastern Switzerland
The &quot;Appenzeller Bahnen&quot; (AB), , with its total of of mainly metre-gauge tracks just recently combined (2006) the earlier separate Trogenerbahn from to , the standard-gauge railway (partial rack railway) from Rorschach to Heiden, the funicular from Rheineck to Walzenhausen, as well as the previous &quot;Appenzeller Bahnen&quot; (including another rack railway). The AB connects towns within the cantons of Appenzell Innerrhoden and Appenzell Ausserrhoden with the city of St. Gallen and other towns in the canton of St. Gallen. Since 2021, the narrow-gauge Frauenfeld–Wil railway (FWB), linking Frauenfeld in the canton of Thurgau with Wil in the canton of St. Gallen, also belongs to Appenzell Railways. All AB lines are used by services of St. Gallen S-Bahn.

;Bernese Oberland and adjacent areas

The Montreux Oberland Bernois Railway (MOB) runs long Montreux–Lenk im Simmental line from Montreux on Lake Geneva to Zweisimmen, with a connecting line to Lenk in the Simmental. The section from Montreux to Zweisimmen, approximately long, is part of the &quot;Golden Pass Panorama&quot; trip from Montreux to Interlaken (and further to Lucerne), a trip which combines rides on the MOB, for some connections the BLS, and from Interlaken onwards the Zentralbahn (zb).

From Interlaken, the narrow-gauge Brünigbahn section of the Zentralbahn (zb) runs further to Lucerne. It skirts Lake Brienz and passes through the range of mountains to the north of the lake via Brünig Pass, and then drops into Obwalden (the Sarner Aa valley) to Lucerne. The zb also runs the line between Lucerne and Engelberg.
The Berner Oberland Bahn (BOB) is a long line from Interlaken to and . It begins at and divides at , about south of Interlaken. The western branch leads to Lauterbrunnen, while the eastern branch leads to Grindelwald. It is possible to make a loop by taking the Lauterbrunnen branch and returning via the Grindelwald branch. The two branches are connected by the Wengernalp Bahn.

The Wengernalpbahn (WAB) is a long line between the villages of Lauterbrunnen and Grindelwald, leading over the Eiger ridge at the junction station at Kleine Scheidegg. In the winter, this junction is a ski resort served by many lifts and trails, as well as the rail line. Skiers can ride the train from the valleys below to return to the top of the runs.

The Jungfraubahn (JB), which is also rack-and-pinion throughout, starts at Kleine Scheidegg and runs through tunnels in the Eiger and Mönch, leading to the &quot;Jungfraujoch&quot;, a saddle between the Mönch and the Jungfrau summits. At the saddle are a visitor centre and an observatory. The Aletsch Glacier, largest in Europe, runs to the south toward the Rhône valley.

The Bergbahn Lauterbrunnen-Mürren (BLM) is long, divided into two independent parts, the first part being a cable car (which runs above the old funicular railway, which was replaced in 2006), the second an adhesion railway.

At the Brienz Rothorn Bahn (BRB), a steam-hauled rack railway, ascends to near the summit of the Brienzer Rothorn.

;Western Switzerland and Valais
The Chemins de fer du Jura (CJ), the railways of the canton of Jura in northern Switzerland, is an long rail network of which is metre gauge, the remaining being standard gauge. It connects to and , both via . Other narrow-gauge railway lines in the Swiss Jura include the La Chaux-de-Fonds–Les Ponts-de-Martel railway and Le Locle–Les Brenets line, both operated by TransN.

In the canton of Vaud, metre-gauge railways include the Chemin de fer Nyon-St-Cergue-Morez, the Chemin de fer Bière-Apples-Morges, the Chemin de fer Yverdon–Ste-Croix, the Chemin de fer Bex–Villars–Bretaye and the Chemin de fer Lausanne–Echallens–Bercher, as well as part of the longer Montreux–Lenk im Simmental line. Another railway line links with Champéry in the canton of Valais.

The Chemin de fer Martigny–Châtelard (MC) is long, with one rack railway section, in the canton of Valais. It runs from to and connects with the Saint-Gervais–Vallorcine railway in France, the joint services being marketed as &quot;Mont-Blanc Express&quot;.

The Gornergrat Bahn climbs for from an elevation of near station of the Zermatt RR to a high top station on the shoulder of the Monte Rosa Mountain. The entire route is a rack-and-pinion railway.

;Ticino
The Ferrovia Lugano–Ponte Tresa (FLP), in canton Ticino, runs from Lugano to Ponte Tresa. The Monte Generoso railway (MG) operates between (or ) and Monte Generoso.

;Other
The Aargau Verkehr company operates two unconnected narrow gauge lines. The Menziken–Aarau–Schöftland line operates in the centre of the canton of Aargau as S14 service of the Aargau S-Bahn. The Bremgarten–Dietikon line operates across the border between the canton of Zurich and eastern Aargau as S17 service of the Zurich S-Bahn. The two lines have a total length of .

The Forch railway (, FB) is a meter gauge railway in the canton of Zurich that operates from to as S18 service of the Zurich S-Bahn. It uses the Zurich tram tracks between Stadelhofen and , while operating on its own tracks outside of the city of Zurich. It is owned and operated by the Forchbahn AG.

Regionalverkehr Bern-Solothurn (RBS) operates three services for Bern S-Bahn on meter gauge lines: the S7 on the Worb Dorf–Worblaufen line, the S8 on the Solothurn–Worblaufen line and the S9 on the Zollikofen–Bern line.

Aare Seeland mobil (ASM) operates two S-Bahn services (S11, S12) on three meter gauge railway lines in the cantons of Bern and Solothurn: the Langenthal–Oensingen, the Langenthal–Melchnau and the Solothurn–Niederbipp lines.

==Urban rail==
Urban rail transit in Switzerland includes trams and light rail in several cities, commuter rail systems centered around cities (known as S-Bahn), a single, small metro system and funiculars. Plans for a rapid transit in Zurich, Switzerland&#x27;s largest city, were discontinued after a referendum.

===Trams===

There are trams operating on nine systems in seven Swiss cities. Street-running tramways are nearly
all . The Chemin de fer Bex–Villars–Bretaye (BVB)
in Bex is more of a mixed interuban light rail line connected to a rack railway but it does have some street running portions, particularly in Bex where the BVB operates along the right of way of a tramway system originally built in the 1890s. Also the &quot;Trogenerbahn&quot; operated by Appenzell Railways (AB) operates on streets in the city of St. Gallen as well as the &quot;Frauenfeld–Wil-Bahn&quot; (FWB) in the city of Frauenfeld the &quot;Forchbahn&quot; in the city of Zurich and the &quot;Chur–Arosa-Bahn&quot; in the city of Chur.

===S-Bahn===

In many parts of Switzerland suburban commuter rail service is today known as S-Bahn. Clock-face scheduling in commuter rail has been first put in place on the line – near Bern in 1964. In 1968, the &quot;Goldcoast Express&quot; on the right side of Lake Zurich followed. In 1982, clock-face scheduling was introduced all over Switzerland. The term &quot;S-Bahn&quot; has been used since 1990 for the Zürich S-Bahn, since 1995 for Bern S-Bahn and since 1997 for the Basel S-Bahn. Other S-Bahn services include Lucerne S-Bahn, St. Gallen S-Bahn, Aargau S-Bahn, Chur S-Bahn and Schaffhausen S-Bahn. Additionally, other terms for commuter rail are in use, like &quot;Stadtbahn Zug&quot;.

Around Fribourg (RER Fribourg) and Lausanne (RER Vaud), it is known as (RER), whereas in the region of Geneva the term is Léman Express. In the canton of Valais, RegionAlps offers S-Bahn services, while in the canton of Ticino such services are provided by TILO.

The commuter rail networks of Zurich, Basel, St. Gallen, Geneva, Schaffhausen and Ticino provide also cross-border transportation services into Austria, Germany, France and Italy, respectively. The Austrian Vorarlberg S-Bahn operates services with Swiss border stations as their terminus, with one service operating through Liechtenstein. The Italian Milan S Lines includes a service operating until the Swiss border station of . Bodensee S-Bahn groups several S-Bahn services around Lake Constance () in Switzerland, Austria and Germany.

===Naming===

Since the naming of the Class Ae 6/6 locomotives (nicknamed , ), it has become common customs for Swiss railway companies to name their locomotives and multiple units (MU). Rolling stock named after cantons or communes often also bear the respective coat of arms. The following is a list of locomotives and MUs of the three main operators that are named.

==Integration of services==
===Between rail services===
Services on the Swiss railway network are integrated with each other and with other modes of public transport, such as local railways, buses, boats/ferries and cable transports, often either in direct proximity or short walking distance, to minimise transfer times. Unlike its European neighbours, Switzerland has not developed a comprehensive high-speed rail network, with the running speed on high-speed lines, the Rothrist–Mattstetten line and Gotthard Base Tunnel, being and , respectively. Instead the priority is not so much the speeding up of trains between cities, but the reduction of connection times through the nodal system. Journey times on main lines between hubs are multiples of 15 minutes so that on the hour or half-hour all trains stand in the nodal stations at the same time, thus minimising connection times. Indeed, the above-mentioned Rothrist–Mattstetten line reduces journey times from to from 72 minutes to 57 minutes, in keeping with the clock-face scheduling.

===Between modes of public transport===
* Rail timetables are integrated with the extensive network of postal buses (branded as &quot;PostBus&quot;, , , ), which serve both plain and high mountain villages, as well as with many other Swiss bus companies. For example, on postal bus line 12.381 the 10:35 from the mountain village of Les Haudères is planned to arrive in the regional city of Sion at 11:20 where a train departs the station (located next to the bus station) at 11:24 for Visp. Indeed, it is a familiar sight to for the postal cars to be already lined up outside the station for the arriving train. From this perspective, the Swiss rail network functions as the core of a wider public transport network.

Other modes of transport concerned by the integrated timetable are:
* Boats/ferries: for example at , , , , 
* Cable cars: for instance at , , , , 
* Funiculars (for example at , , , , ) and other mountain railways (for instance at , , )
* Metro: at , , 
* Heritage railways: at , , 

===Links to airports===
* The two main airports, Zurich Airport and Geneva Airport, both have their own subterranean railway stations, () and (). Zurich Airport also has tram links to the city. Other airports have bus links to/from nearby railway stations: EuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg with , Bern Airport with , St. Gallen–Altenrhein Airport with and Sion Airport with . Lugano Airport is close to .

== Integration with private transport ==

* About 600 railway stations feature park and ride, known as P+Rail in Switzerland, which allows commuting partly by private and partly by public transport. Mobility is a cooperative for car sharing. Mobility cars are available at many railway stations.

* There are also car and truck transportation services () on some lines, mainly in mountainous areas.

* Some trains feature an area (indicated either near or on the doors), or even an entire railroad car (e.g. trains on the Altstätten–Gais railway line), for transportation of bicycles. Most railway stations have a bicycle parking and/or bicycle parking station. Some railway stations also offer bicycle washing and repair services.

==Costs and subsidies==
Although public investment is positively correlated with a given railway system&#x27;s performance, the European Railway Performance Index finds differences in the value that countries receive in return for their public cost. The 2017 Index found Switzerland captures high value for money relative to the average ratio of performance to cost among European countries.

===Passenger transport===
In 2012, the total costs for passenger transport on Swiss railway network was CHF 8.88 billion, of which CHF 4.46 billion (50%) were due to infrastructure costs, CHF 3.98 billion (45%) were costs of transportation means, CHF 427 million due to environmental and health costs, and CHF 25 million due to accidents.

CHF 4.28 billion, or 48.2%, were paid by passengers, and CHF 4.15 billion (or 47%) came from rail subsidies provided by federal, cantonal, and municipal contributions. CHF 426 million (or 4.8%) were contributed by the common weal (accident and health insurances, environmental funds etc.).

===Freight transport===
In 2012, the total costs for freight transport on Swiss railway network was CHF 2.063 billion, of which CHF 779 million (37.8%) were due to infrastructure costs, CHF 900 million (43.6%) were costs of transportation means, CHF 59 million due to environmental and health costs, and CHF 325 million (15.8%) due to accidents.

CHF 1.058 billion, or 51.3%, were paid by customers, and CHF 122 million (5.9%) by transporting companies, while CHF 555 million (26.9%) were subsidised by federal, cantonal, and municipal contributions. CHF 328 millions (15.9%) were contributed by the common weal (accident and health insurances, environmental funds etc.).

==History==
The construction and operation of Swiss railways during the 19th century was carried out by private railways. The first internal line (known as the ) was a line opened from Zürich to Baden in 1847, operated by the Swiss Northern Railway. By 1860 railways connected western and northeastern Switzerland but the Alps remained an insurmountable barrier for railways, which need low gradients. The first trans-alpine railway and north–south axis in Switzerland finally opened in 1882. It was the Gotthard Railway, with at its heart the Gotthard Tunnel, passing well below the Gotthard Pass. A second line was opened even lower under the Simplon Pass in 1906 (the Simplon Railway), and a third under the Lötschberg in 1913 (the Lötschberg Railway).

In 1901 the major railways were nationalised to form Swiss Federal Railways. During the first half of the 20th century they were electrified and slowly upgraded. After the Second World War rail rapidly lost its share of the rail market to road transport as car ownership rose and more roads were built. From 1970 the Federal Government has become more involved in upgrading the railways, especially in urban areas and on trunk routes under the Rail 2000 project. In addition, two major trans-alpine routes—the Gotthard Railway and the Lötschberg approach to the Simplon—were rebuilt under the NRLA project. As a consequence, two new flat routes through the Alps opened in the early 21st century: The Lötschberg Base Tunnel in 2007 and the Gotthard Base Tunnel in 2016.

Between 1869 and 1976, goods wagons were carried from station across Lake Constance using train ferries.

<text>Action research is a philosophy and methodology of research generally applied in the social sciences. It seeks transformative change through the simultaneous process of taking action and doing research, which are linked together by critical reflection. Kurt Lewin, then a professor at MIT, first coined the term &quot;action research&quot; in 1944. In his 1946 paper &quot;Action Research and Minority Problems&quot; he described action research as &quot;a comparative research on the conditions and effects of various forms of social action and research leading to social action&quot; that uses &quot;a spiral of steps, each of which is composed of a circle of planning, action and fact-finding about the result of the action&quot;.

==Process==

Action research is an interactive inquiry process that balances problem-solving actions implemented in a collaborative context with data-driven collaborative analysis or research to understand underlying causes enabling future predictions about personal and organizational change.

After seven decades of action research development, many methods have evolved that adjust the balance to focus more on the actions taken or more on the research that results from the reflective understanding of the actions.
This tension exists between:

# those who are more driven either by the researcher&#x27;s agenda or by participants;
# those who are motivated primarily by instrumental goal attainment or by the aim of personal, organizational or societal transformation; and
# 1st-, to 2nd-, to 3rd-person research, that is, my research on my own action, aimed primarily at personal change; our research on our group (family/team), aimed primarily at improving the group; and &#x27;scholarly&#x27; research aimed primarily at theoretical generalization or large-scale change.

Action research challenges traditional social science by moving beyond reflective knowledge created by outside experts sampling variables, to an active moment-to-moment theorizing, data collecting and inquiry occurring in the midst of emergent structure. &quot;Knowledge is always gained through action and for action. From this starting point, to question the validity of social knowledge is to question, not how to develop a reflective science about action, but how to develop genuinely well-informed action – how to conduct an action science&quot;. In this sense, engaging in action research is a form of problem-based investigation by practitioners into their practice, thus it is an empirical process. The goal is both to create and share knowledge in the social sciences.

==Major theoretical approaches==

===Chris Argyris&#x27; action science ===

Chris Argyris&#x27; action science begins with the study of how human beings design their actions in difficult situations. Humans design their actions to achieve intended consequences and are governed by a set of environment variables. How those governing variables are treated in designing actions are the key differences between single-loop and double-loop learning. When actions are designed to achieve the intended consequences and to suppress conflict about the governing variables, a single-loop learning cycle usually ensues.

On the other hand, when actions are taken not only to achieve the intended consequences, but also to openly inquire about conflict and to possibly transform the governing variables, both single- and double-loop learning cycles usually ensue. (Argyris applies single- and double-loop learning concepts not only to personal behaviors but also to organizational behaviors in his models.) This is different from experimental research in which environmental variables are controlled and researchers try to find out cause and effect in an isolated environment.

=== John Heron and Peter Reason&#x27;s cooperative inquiry ===
Cooperative, aka collaborative, inquiry was first proposed by John Heron in 1971 and later expanded with Peter Reason and Demi Brown. The major idea is to &quot;research &#x27;with&#x27; rather than &#x27;on&#x27; people.&quot; It emphasizes the full involvement in research decisions of all active participants as co-researchers.

Cooperative inquiry creates a research cycle among 4 different types of knowledge: propositional (as in contemporary science), practical (the knowledge that comes with actually doing what you propose), experiential (the real-time feedback we get about our interaction with the larger world) and presentational (the artistic rehearsal process through which we craft new practices). At every cycle, the research process includes these four stages, with deepening experience and knowledge of the initial proposition, or of new propositions.

=== Paulo Freire&#x27;s participatory action research ===
Participatory action research builds on the critical pedagogy put forward by Paulo Freire as a response to the traditional formal models of education where the &quot;teacher&quot; stands at the front and &quot;imparts&quot; information to the &quot;students&quot; who are passive recipients. This was further developed in &quot;adult education&quot; models throughout Latin America.

Orlando Fals-Borda (1925–2008), Colombian sociologist and political activist, was one of the principal promoters of participatory action research (IAP in Spanish) in Latin America. He published a &quot;double history of the coast&quot;, book that compares the official &quot;history&quot; and the non-official &quot;story&quot; of the north coast of Colombia.

=== William Barry&#x27;s living educational theory approach to action research ===
William Barry defined an approach to action research which focuses on creating ontological weight. He adapted the idea of ontological weight to action research from existential Christian philosopher Gabriel Marcel. Barry was influenced by Jean McNiff&#x27;s and Jack Whitehead&#x27;s phraseology of living theory action research but was diametrically opposed to the validation process advocated by Whitehead which demanded video &quot;evidence&quot; of &quot;energy flowing values&quot; and his atheistic ontological position which influenced his conception of values in action research.

Barry explained that living educational theory (LET) is &quot;a critical and transformational approach to action research. It confronts the researcher to challenge the status quo of their educational practice and to answer the question, &#x27;How can I improve what I&#x27;m doing?&#x27; Researchers who use this approach must be willing to recognize and assume responsibility for being &#x27;living contradictions&#x27; in their professional practice – thinking one way and acting in another. The mission of the LET action researcher is to overcome workplace norms and self-behavior which contradict the researcher&#x27;s values and beliefs. The vision of the LET researcher is to make an original contribution to knowledge through generating an educational theory proven to improve the learning of people within a social learning space. The standard of judgment for theory validity is evidence of workplace reform, transformational growth of the researcher, and improved learning by the people researcher claimed to have influenced...&quot;.

===Action research in organization development===

Wendell L. French and Cecil Bell define organization development (OD) at one point as &quot;organization improvement through action research&quot;. If one idea can be said to summarize OD&#x27;s underlying philosophy, it would be action research as it was conceptualized by Kurt Lewin and later elaborated and expanded on by other behavioral scientists. Concerned with social change and, more particularly, with effective, permanent social change, Lewin believed that the motivation to change was strongly related to action: If people are active in decisions affecting them, they are more likely to adopt new ways. &quot;Rational social management&quot;, he said, &quot;proceeds in a spiral of steps, each of which is composed of a circle of planning, action and fact-finding about the result of action&quot;.

* Unfreezing: first step.
* Changing: The situation is diagnosed and new models of behavior are explored and tested.
* Refreezing: Application of new behavior is evaluated, and if reinforcing, adopted.

Lewin&#x27;s description of the process of change involves three steps:
&quot;Figure 1&quot; summarizes the steps and processes involved in planned change through action research. Action research is depicted as a cyclical process of change.

# The cycle begins with a series of planning actions initiated by the client and the change agent working together. The principal elements of this stage include a preliminary diagnosis, data gathering, feedback of results, and joint action planning. In the language of systems theory, this is the input phase, in which the client system becomes aware of problems as yet unidentified, realizes it may need outside help to effect changes, and shares with the consultant the process of problem diagnosis.
# The second stage of action research is the action, or transformation, phase. This stage includes actions relating to learning processes (perhaps in the form of role analysis) and to planning and executing behavioral changes in the client organization. As shown in Figure 1, feedback at this stage would move via Feedback Loop A and would have the effect of altering previous planning to bring the learning activities of the client system into better alignment with change objectives. Included in this stage is action-planning activity carried out jointly by the consultant and members of the client system. Following the workshop or learning sessions, these action steps are carried out on the job as part of the transformation stage.
# The third stage of action research is the output or results phase. This stage includes actual changes in behavior (if any) resulting from corrective action steps taken following the second stage. Data are again gathered from the client system so that progress can be determined and necessary adjustments in learning activities can be made. Minor adjustments of this nature can be made in learning activities via Feedback Loop B (see &quot;Figure 1&quot;).

Major adjustments and reevaluations would return the OD project to the first or planning stage for basic changes in the program. The action-research model shown in &quot;Figure 1&quot; closely follows Lewin&#x27;s repetitive cycle of planning, action, and measuring results. It also illustrates other aspects of Lewin&#x27;s general model of change. As indicated in the diagram, the planning stage is a period of unfreezing, or problem awareness. The action stage is a period of changing, that is, trying out new forms of behavior in an effort to understand and cope with the system&#x27;s problems. (There is inevitable overlap between the stages, since the boundaries are not clear-cut and cannot be in a continuous process).

The results stage is a period of refreezing, in which new behaviors are tried out on the job and, if successful and reinforcing, become a part of the system&#x27;s repertoire of problem-solving behavior. Action research is problem centered, client centered, and action oriented. It involves the client system in a diagnostic, active-learning, problem-finding and problem-solving process.

==Worldwide expansion==

Action research has become a significant methodology for intervention, development and change within groups and communities. It is promoted and implemented by many international development agencies and university programs, as well as local community organizations around the world, such as AERA and Claremont Lincoln in America, CARN in the United Kingdom, CCAR in Sweden, CLAYSS in Argentina, CARPED and PRIA in India, and ARNA in the Americas.

The Center for Collaborative Action Research makes available a set of twelve tutorials as a self-paced online course in learning how to do action research. It includes a free workbook that can be used online or printed.

==Journal==

The field is supported by a quarterly peer-reviewed academic journal, &quot;Action Research&quot;, founded in 2003 and edited by Hilary Bradbury.

<text>Apes (collectively Hominoidea ) are a clade of Old World simians native to sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia (though they were more widespread in Africa, most of Asia, and Europe in prehistory, and counting humans are found globally). Apes are more closely related to Old World monkeys (family Cercopithecidae) than to the New World monkeys (Platyrrhini) with both Old World monkeys and apes placed in the clade Catarrhini. Apes do not have tails due to a mutation of the TBXT gene. In traditional and non-scientific use, the term &quot;ape&quot; can include tailless primates taxonomically considered Cercopithecidae (such as the Barbary ape and black ape), and is thus not equivalent to the scientific taxon Hominoidea. There are two extant branches of the superfamily Hominoidea: the gibbons, or lesser apes; and the hominids, or great apes.
* The family Hylobatidae, the lesser apes, include four genera and a total of 20 species of gibbon, including the lar gibbon and the siamang, all native to Asia. They are highly arboreal and bipedal on the ground. They have lighter bodies and smaller social groups than great apes.
* The family Hominidae (&quot;hominids&quot;), the great apes, include four genera comprising three extant species of orangutans and their subspecies, two extant species of gorillas and their subspecies, two extant species of chimpanzees and their subspecies, and humans in a single extant subspecies.

Except for gorillas and humans, hominoids are agile climbers of trees. Apes eat a variety of plant and animal foods, with the majority of food being plant foods, which can include fruits, leaves, stalks, roots and seeds, including nuts and grass seeds. Human diets are sometimes substantially different from that of other hominoids due in part to the development of technology and a wide range of habitation.

All non-human hominoids are rare and threatened with extinction. The main threat is habitat loss, though some populations are further imperiled by hunting. The great apes of Africa are also facing threat from the Ebola virus.

== Name and terminology ==

&quot;Ape&quot;, from Old English &quot;apa&quot;, is a word of uncertain origin. The term has a history of rather imprecise usage—and of comedic or punning usage in the vernacular. Its earliest meaning was generally of any non-human anthropoid primate, as is still the case for its cognates in other Germanic languages.
Later, after the term &quot;monkey&quot; had been introduced into English, &quot;ape&quot; was specialized to refer to a tailless (therefore exceptionally human-like) primate. Thus, the term &quot;ape&quot; obtained two different meanings, as shown in the 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; entry: it could be used as a synonym for &quot;monkey&quot; and it could denote the tailless human-like primate in particular.

Some, or recently all, hominoids are also called &quot;apes&quot;, but the term is used broadly and has several different senses within both popular and scientific settings. &quot;Ape&quot; has been used as a synonym for &quot;monkey&quot; or for naming any primate with a human-like appearance, particularly those without a tail. Biologists have traditionally used the term &quot;ape&quot; to mean a member of the superfamily Hominoidea &quot;other than&quot; humans, but more recently to mean &quot;all&quot; members of Hominoidea. So &quot;ape&quot;—not to be confused with &quot;great ape&quot;—now becomes another word for hominoid &quot;including&quot; humans.

The taxonomic term &quot;hominoid&quot; is derived from, and intended as encompassing, the &quot;hominids,&quot; the family of great apes. Both terms were introduced by Gray (1825). The term &quot;hominins&quot; is also due to Gray (1824), intended as including the human lineage (see also Hominidae#Terminology, Human taxonomy).

The distinction between apes and monkeys is complicated by the traditional paraphyly of monkeys: Apes emerged as a sister group of Old World Monkeys in the catarrhines, which are a sister group of New World Monkeys. Therefore, cladistically, apes, catarrhines and related contemporary extinct groups such as Parapithecidae are monkeys as well, for any consistent definition of &quot;monkey&quot;. &quot;Old World monkey&quot; may also legitimately be taken to be meant to include all the catarrhines, including apes and extinct species such as &quot;Aegyptopithecus&quot;, in which case the apes, Cercopithecoidea and &quot;Aegyptopithecus&quot; emerged within the Old World monkeys.

The primates called &quot;apes&quot; today became known to Europeans after the 18th century. As zoological knowledge developed, it became clear that taillessness occurred in a number of different and otherwise distantly related species. Sir Wilfrid Le Gros Clark was one of those primatologists who developed the idea that there were trends in primate evolution and that the extant members of the order could be arranged in an &quot;ascending series&quot;, leading from &quot;monkeys&quot; to &quot;apes&quot; to humans. Within this tradition &quot;ape&quot; came to refer to all members of the superfamily Hominoidea except humans. As such, this use of &quot;apes&quot; represented a paraphyletic grouping, meaning that, even though all species of apes were descended from a common ancestor, this grouping did &quot;not&quot; include all the descendant species, because humans were excluded from being among the apes.

Traditionally, the English-language vernacular name &quot;apes&quot; does not include humans, but phylogenetically, humans (&quot;Homo&quot;) form part of the family Hominidae within Hominoidea. Thus, there are at least three common, or traditional, uses of the term &quot;ape&quot;: non-specialists may not distinguish between &quot;monkeys&quot; and &quot;apes&quot;, that is, they may use the two terms interchangeably; or they may use &quot;ape&quot; for any tailless monkey or non-human hominoid; or they may use the term &quot;ape&quot; to just mean the non-human hominoids.

Modern taxonomy aims for the use of monophyletic groups for taxonomic classification;
Some literature may now use the common name &quot;ape&quot; to mean all members of the superfamily Hominoidea, including humans. For example, in his 2005 book, Benton wrote &quot;The apes, Hominoidea, today include the gibbons and orang-utan ... the gorilla and chimpanzee ... and humans&quot;. Modern biologists and primatologists refer to apes that are not human as &quot;non-human&quot; apes. Scientists broadly, other than paleoanthropologists, may use the term &quot;hominin&quot; to identify the human clade, replacing the term &quot;hominid&quot;. See terminology of primate names.

See below, History of hominoid taxonomy, for a discussion of changes in scientific classification and terminology regarding hominoids.

== Evolution ==
Although the hominoid fossil record is still incomplete and fragmentary, there is now enough evidence to provide an outline of the evolutionary history of humans. Previously, the divergence between humans and other extant hominoids was thought to have occurred 15 to 20 million years ago, and several species of that time period, such as &quot;Ramapithecus&quot;, were once thought to be hominins and possible ancestors of humans. But, later fossil finds indicated that &quot;Ramapithecus&quot; was more closely related to the orangutan; and new biochemical evidence indicates that the last common ancestor of humans and non-hominins (that is, the chimpanzees) occurred between 5 and 10 million years ago, and probably nearer the lower end of that range (more recent); see Chimpanzee–human last common ancestor (CHLCA).

== Taxonomic classification and phylogeny ==
Genetic analysis combined with fossil evidence indicates that hominoids diverged from the Old World monkeys about 25 million years ago (mya), near the Oligocene–Miocene boundary. The gibbons split from the rest about 18 mya, and the hominid splits happened 14 mya (&quot;Pongo&quot;), 7 mya (&quot;Gorilla&quot;), and 3–5 mya (&quot;Homo&quot; &amp; &quot;Pan&quot;). In 2015, a new genus and species were described, &quot;Pliobates cataloniae&quot;, which lived 11.6 mya, and appears to predate the split between Hominidae and Hylobatidae.

=== History of hominoid taxonomy ===
The history of hominoid taxonomy is complex and somewhat confusing. Recent evidence has changed our understanding of the relationships between the hominoids, especially regarding the human lineage; and the traditionally used terms have become somewhat confused. Competing approaches to methodology and terminology are found among current scientific sources. Over time, authorities have changed the names and the meanings of names of groups and subgroups as new evidence — that is, new discoveries of fossils and tools and of observations in the field, plus continual comparisons of anatomy and DNA sequences — has changed the understanding of relationships between hominoids. There has been a gradual demotion of humans from being &#x27;special&#x27; in the taxonomy to being one branch among many. This recent turmoil (of history) illustrates the growing influence on all taxonomy of cladistics, the science of classifying living things strictly according to their lines of descent.

Today, there are eight extant genera of hominoids. They are the four genera in the family Hominidae, namely &quot;Homo&quot;, &quot;Pan&quot;, &quot;Gorilla&quot;, and &quot;Pongo&quot;; plus four genera in the family Hylobatidae (gibbons): &quot;Hylobates&quot;, &quot;Hoolock&quot;, &quot;Nomascus&quot; and &quot;Symphalangus&quot;. (The two subspecies of hoolock gibbons were recently moved from the genus &quot;Bunopithecus&quot; to the new genus &quot;Hoolock&quot; and re-ranked as species; a third species was described in January 2017).

In 1758, Carl Linnaeus, relying on second- or third-hand accounts, placed a second species in &quot;Homo&quot; along with &quot;H. sapiens&quot;: &quot;Homo troglodytes&quot; (&quot;cave-dwelling man&quot;). Although the term &quot;Orang Outang&quot; is listed as a variety – &quot;Homo sylvestris&quot; – under this species, it is nevertheless not clear to which animal this name refers, as Linnaeus had no specimen to refer to, hence no precise description. Linnaeus may have based &quot;Homo troglodytes&quot; on reports of mythical creatures, then-unidentified simians, or Asian natives dressed in animal skins. Linnaeus named the orangutan &quot;Simia satyrus&quot; (&quot;satyr monkey&quot;). He placed the three genera &quot;Homo&quot;, &quot;Simia&quot; and &quot;Lemur&quot; in the order of Primates.

The &quot;troglodytes&quot; name was used for the chimpanzee by Blumenbach in 1775, but moved to the genus &quot;Simia&quot;. The orangutan was moved to the genus &quot;Pongo&quot; in 1799 by Lacépède.

Linnaeus&#x27;s inclusion of humans in the primates with monkeys and apes was troubling for people who denied a close relationship between humans and the rest of the animal kingdom. Linnaeus&#x27;s Lutheran archbishop had accused him of &quot;impiety&quot;. In a letter to Johann Georg Gmelin dated 25 February 1747, Linnaeus wrote:

Accordingly, Johann Friedrich Blumenbach in the first edition of his &quot;Manual of Natural History&quot; (1779), proposed that the primates be divided into the Quadrumana (four-handed, i.e. apes and monkeys) and Bimana (two-handed, i.e. humans). This distinction was taken up by other naturalists, most notably Georges Cuvier. Some elevated the distinction to the level of order.

However, the many affinities between humans and other primates – and especially the &quot;great apes&quot; – made it clear that the distinction made no scientific sense. In his 1871 book &quot;The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex&quot;, Charles Darwin wrote:

=== Changes in taxonomy and terminology ===

== Characteristics ==

The lesser apes are the gibbon family, Hylobatidae, of sixteen species; all are native to Asia. Their major differentiating characteristic is their long arms, which they use to brachiate through trees. Their wrists are ball and socket joints as an evolutionary adaptation to their arboreal lifestyle. Generally smaller than the African apes, the largest gibbon, the siamang, weighs up to ; in comparison, the smallest &quot;great ape&quot;, the bonobo, is .

The superfamily Hominoidea falls within the parvorder Catarrhini, which also includes the Old World monkeys of Africa and Eurasia. Within this grouping, the two families Hylobatidae and Hominidae can be distinguished from Old World monkeys by the number of cusps on their molars; hominoids have five in the &quot;Y-5&quot; molar pattern, whereas Old World monkeys have only four in a bilophodont pattern.

Further, in comparison with Old World monkeys, hominoids are noted for: more mobile shoulder joints and arms due to the dorsal position of the scapula; broader ribcages that are flatter front-to-back; and a shorter, less mobile spine, with greatly reduced caudal (tail) vertebrae—resulting in complete loss of the tail in extant hominoid species. These are anatomical adaptations, first, to vertical hanging and swinging locomotion (brachiation) and, later, to developing balance in a bipedal pose. Note there are primates in other families that also lack tails, and at least one, the pig-tailed langur, is known to walk significant distances bipedally. The front of the ape skull is characterised by its sinuses, fusion of the frontal bone, and by post-orbital constriction.

=== Distinction from monkeys ===
Cladistically, apes, catarrhines, and extinct species such as Aegyptopithecus and Parapithecidaea, are monkeys, so one can only specify ape features not present in other monkeys.

Unlike most monkeys, apes do not possess a tail. Monkeys are more likely to be in trees and use their tails for balance. While the great apes are considerably larger than monkeys, gibbons (lesser apes) are smaller than some monkeys. Apes are considered to be more intelligent than monkeys, which are considered to have more primitive brains.

The enzyme urate oxidase has become inactive in all apes, its function having been lost in two primate lineages during the middle Miocene; first in the common ancestors of Hominidae, and later in the common ancestor of Hylobatidae. It has been hypothesized that in both incidents it was a mutation that occurred in apes living in Europe when the climate was getting colder, leading to starvation during winter. The mutation changed the biochemistry of the apes and made it easier to accumulate fat, which allowed the animals to survive longer periods of starvation. When they migrated to Asia and Africa, this genetic trait remained.

== Behaviour ==

Major studies of behaviour in the field were completed on the three better-known &quot;great apes&quot;, for example by Jane Goodall, Dian Fossey and Birutė Galdikas. These studies have shown that in their natural environments, the non-human hominoids show sharply varying social structure: gibbons are monogamous, territorial pair-bonders, orangutans are solitary, gorillas live in small troops with a single adult male leader, while chimpanzees live in larger troops with bonobos exhibiting promiscuous sexual behaviour. Their diets also vary; gorillas are foliovores, while the others are all primarily frugivores, although the common chimpanzee hunts for meat. Foraging behaviour is correspondingly variable.

In November 2023, scientists reported, for the first time, evidence that groups of primates, including apes, and, particularly bonobos, are capable of cooperating with each other.

=== Diet ===

Apart from humans and gorillas, apes eat a predominantly frugivorous diet, mostly fruit, but supplemented with a variety of other foods. Gorillas are predominantly folivorous, eating mostly stalks, shoots, roots and leaves with some fruit and other foods. Non-human apes usually eat a small amount of raw animal foods such as insects or eggs. In the case of humans, migration and the invention of hunting tools and cooking has led to an even wider variety of foods and diets, with many human diets including large amounts of cooked tubers (roots) or legumes. Other food production and processing methods including animal husbandry and industrial refining and processing have further changed human diets. Humans and other apes occasionally eat other primates. Some of these primates are now close to extinction with habitat loss being the underlying cause.

=== Cognition ===
All the non-human hominoids are generally thought of as highly intelligent, and scientific study has broadly confirmed that they perform very well on a wide range of cognitive tests—though there is relatively little data on gibbon cognition. The early studies by Wolfgang Köhler demonstrated exceptional problem-solving abilities in chimpanzees, which Köhler attributed to insight. The use of tools has been repeatedly demonstrated; more recently, the manufacture of tools has been documented, both in the wild and in laboratory tests. Imitation is much more easily demonstrated in &quot;great apes&quot; than in other primate species. Almost all the studies in animal language acquisition have been done with &quot;great apes&quot;, and though there is continuing dispute as to whether they demonstrate real language abilities, there is no doubt that they involve significant feats of learning. Chimpanzees in different parts of Africa have developed tools that are used in food acquisition, demonstrating a form of animal culture.

== Threats and conservation ==
All non-human hominoids are rare and threatened with extinction. The eastern hoolock gibbon is the least threatened, only being vulnerable to extinction. Five gibbon species are critically endangered, as are all species of orangutan and gorilla. The remaining species of gibbon, the bonobo, and all four subspecies of chimpanzees are endangered. The chief threat to most of the endangered species is loss of tropical rainforest habitat, though some populations are further imperiled by hunting for bushmeat. The great apes of Africa are also facing threat from the Ebola virus. Currently considered to be the greatest threat to survival of African apes, Ebola infection is responsible for the death of at least one third of all gorillas and chimpanzees since 1990.

All the species of great apes in Africa, are considered endangered. Hunting, logging, agricultural expansion and mining are among the main threats. Recently mining has expanded due to the energy transition. According to researchers &quot;This means that current climate solutions could lead to more industrialization in these places, which could worsen the climate crisis&quot;. The  Sustainable Critical Minerals Alliance was created for solve problems like this.

<text>Vladikavkaz, formerly known as Ordzhonikidze () or Dzaudzhikau (), is the capital city of North Ossetia-Alania, Russia. It is located in the southeast of the republic at the foothills of the Caucasus, situated on the Terek River. The city&#x27;s population was 295,830 as of the 2021 Census. As a result, Vladikavkaz is one of the most populous cities in the North Caucasus region.

The city is an industrial and transportation centre. Manufactured products include processed zinc and lead, machinery, chemicals, clothing and food products.

== Etymology ==

The name &quot;Vladikavkaz&quot;, derived from the Russian language, literally means &quot;ruler of the Caucasus&quot;.
The Ossetian name Dzæwdžyqæw/Dzæwægighæw literally means &quot; settlement&quot;.

In 1911, wrote that the Ossetians prove that fortress was founded on the site of the Ingush village Zaur by the name of Vladikavkaz in the Ossetian language:

In 1931, at the suggestion of the Ingush Regional Executive Committee, the city of Vladikavkaz was renamed Ordzhonikidze in honor of the Soviet political and military leader Sergo Ordzhonikidze, who during the Civil War established Soviet power in the region.

In 1944, after the deportation of the Chechens and Ingush, the city of Ordzhonikidze was renamed the city of Dzaudzhikau, and in 1954 again Ordzhonikidze. In 1990, the city acquired a double name, Vladikavkaz in Russian and Dzaudzhikau in Ossetian.

The second part of the name Dzaudzhikau, i.e Kau (village), is a cognate of the word &quot;āguv&quot; (village) in the Eastern Iranian language of Khotanese Saka and the Avestan &quot;gava&quot; (district)

== History ==
The city was founded in 1784 as a Russian fortress at the entrance to the Darial Gorge near to the Ingush village Zaur, which had the purpose of serving as an outpost for the routes of communication between Russia and Georgia. But according to a lot of other sources, Vladikavkaz was founded on the site of the Ossetian village of Kapkai. 

The Georgian Military Highway, crossing the mountains, was constructed in 1799 to link the city with Georgia to the south, and in 1875 a railway was built to connect it to Rostov-on-Don and Baku in Azerbaijan. Vladikavkaz has become an important industrial centre for the region, with smelting, refining, chemicals and manufacturing industries. During the Russian Empire, the settlement was the administrative capital of the Vladikavkazsky Okrug of the Terek Oblast.
The city is one of the largest in the Russian-controlled Caucasus, along with Grozny, and was the capital of the Mountain Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, a Soviet Republic established after the annexation of the Mountainous Republic of the North Caucasus. It existed from 1921 to 1924 and comprised most of the modern-day territories of Chechnya, North Ossetia and Kabardino-Balkaria.

Vladikavkaz was fought over in both the Russian Civil War and World War II. In February 1919, the anti-Communist Volunteer Army under General Anton Denikin seized the city, before being expelled by the Red Army in March 1920. In early November 1942, the forces of Nazi Germany tried unsuccessfully to seize the city but were repelled by the Soviet army. The Nazis left North Ossetia in January 1943.

On 26 November 2008, Vitaly Karayev, the mayor of Vladikavkaz was assassinated by an unidentified gunman. On 31 December 2008, his successor, Kazbek Pagiyev, was also assassinated by unidentified gunmen.

== Transportation ==

The city is served by the bus network (&quot;marshrutkas&quot;). There are also tram (since 1904) and trolleybus (since 1977) networks, plus the main Vladikavkaz railway station.

The city is served by Beslan Airport located about 9 kilometres from the city.

The Georgian Military Road, which is a part of European route E117, starts in Vladikavkaz and it connects the city with the South Caucasus.

<text>The Tupolev Tu-154 (; NATO reporting name: &quot;Careless&quot;) is a three-engined, medium-range, narrow-body airliner designed in the mid-1960s and manufactured by Tupolev. A workhorse of Soviet and (subsequently) Russian airlines for several decades, it carried half of all passengers flown by Aeroflot and its subsidiaries (137.5 million/year or 243.8 billion passenger-km in 1990), remaining the standard domestic-route airliner of Russia and former Soviet states until the mid-2000s. It was exported to 17 non-Russian airlines and used as a head-of-state transport by the air forces of several countries.

The aircraft has a cruising speed of and a range of . Capable of operating from unpaved and gravel airfields with only basic facilities, it was widely used in the extreme Arctic conditions of Russia&#x27;s northern/eastern regions, where other airliners were unable to operate. Originally designed for a 45,000-hour service life (18,000 cycles), but capable of 80,000 hours with upgrades, it was expected to continue in service until 2016, although newer noise regulations have restricted it from flying to Western Europe and other regions.

==Development==
The Tu-154 was developed to meet Aeroflot&#x27;s requirement to replace the jet-powered Tu-104 and the Antonov An-10 and Ilyushin Il-18 turboprops. The requirements called for either a payload capacity of with a range of while cruising at , or a payload of with a range of while cruising at . A take-off distance of at maximum takeoff weight was also stipulated as a requirement. Conceptually similar to the British Hawker Siddeley Trident, which first flew in 1962, and the American Boeing 727, which first flew in 1963, the medium-range Tu-154 was marketed by Tupolev at the same time as Ilyushin was marketing its long-range Ilyushin Il-62. The Soviet Ministry of Aircraft Industry chose the Tu-154, as it incorporated the latest in Soviet aircraft design and best met Aeroflot&#x27;s anticipated requirements for the 1970s and 1980s.

The first project chief was ; in 1964, assumed that position. In 1975, the project lead role was turned over to .

The Tu-154 first flew on 4 October 1968. The first deliveries to Aeroflot were in 1970 with freight (mail) services beginning in May 1971 and passenger services in February 1972. Limited production of the 154M model was still occurring as of January 2009, despite previous announcements of the end of production in 2006. In total, 1025 Tu-154s have been built, 214 of which were still in service as of 14 December 2009. The last serial Tu-154 was delivered to the Russian Defense Ministry on 19 February 2013 from the Aviakor factory, equipped with upgraded avionics, a VIP interior, and a communications suite. The factory has four unfinished airframes in its inventory, which can be completed if new orders are received.

==Design==

The Tu-154 is powered by three rear-mounted, low-bypass turbofan engines arranged similarly to those of the Boeing 727, but it is slightly larger than its American counterpart. Both the 727 and the Tu-154 use an S-duct for the middle (number-two) engine. The original model was equipped with Kuznetsov NK-8-2 engines, which were replaced with Soloviev D-30KU-154s in the Tu-154M. All Tu-154 aircraft models have a relatively high thrust-to-weight ratio, giving the type excellent performance, though at the expense of lower fuel efficiency. This became an important factor in later decades as fuel costs grew.
The cockpit is fitted with conventional dual yoke control columns. Flight control surfaces are hydraulically operated.

The cabin of the Tu-154, although of the same six-abreast seating layout, gives the impression of an oval interior, with a lower ceiling than is common on Boeing and Airbus airliners. The passenger cabin accommodates 128 passengers in a two-class layout and 164 passengers in single-class layout, and up to 180 passengers in high-density layout. The layout can be modified to a winter version where some seats are taken out and a wardrobe is installed for passenger coats. The passenger doors are smaller than on its Boeing and Airbus counterparts. Luggage space in the overhead compartments is very limited.

Like the Tupolev Tu-134, the Tu-154 has a wing swept back at 35° at the quarter-chord line. The British Hawker Siddeley Trident has the same sweepback angle, while the Boeing 727 has a slightly smaller sweepback angle of 32°. The wing also has anhedral (downward sweep) which is a distinguishing feature of Russian low-wing airliners designed during this era. Most Western low-wing airliners such as the contemporary Boeing 727 have dihedral (upward sweep). The anhedral means that Russian airliners have poor lateral stability compared to their Western counterparts, but also are more resistant to Dutch roll tendencies.

Considerably heavier than its predecessor Soviet-built airliner, the Ilyushin Il-18, the Tu-154 was equipped with an oversized landing gear to reduce ground load, enabling it to operate from the same runways. The aircraft has two six-wheel main bogies fitted with large, low-pressure tires that retract into pods extending from the trailing edges of the wings (a common Tupolev feature), plus a two-wheel nose gear unit. Soft oleo struts (shock absorbers) provide a much smoother ride on bumpy airfields than most airliners, which very rarely operate on such poor surfaces.

The original requirement was to have a three-person flight crew – captain, first officer, and flight engineer – as opposed to a four- or five-person crew, as on other Soviet airliners. A fourth crew member, a navigator, was soon found to be still needed, and a seat was added on production aircraft, although that workstation was compromised due to the limitations of the original design. Navigators are no longer trained, and this profession is becoming obsolete with the retirement of the oldest Soviet-era planes.

The latest variant (Tu-154M-100, introduced 1998) includes an NVU-B3 Doppler navigation system, a triple autopilot, which provides an automatic ILS approach according to ICAO category II weather minima, an autothrottle, a Doppler drift and speed measure system, and a &quot;Kurs-MP&quot; radio navigation suite. A stability and control augmentation system improves handling characteristics during manual flight. Modern upgrades normally include modernised TCAS, GPS, and other systems (mostly American- or EU-made).

Early versions of the Tu-154 cannot be modified to meet the current Stage III noise regulations, so are no longer allowed to fly into airspace where such regulations are enforced, such as the European Union, but the Tu-154M&#x27;s D-30 engines can be fitted with hush kits, allowing them to meet noise regulations.

==Variants==


Many variants of this airliner have been built. Like its Western counterpart, the Boeing 727, many of the Tu-154s in service have been hush-kitted, and some converted to freighters.

; Tu-154
: Tu-154 production started in 1970, and the first passenger flight was performed on 9 February 1972. Powered by Kuznetsov NK-8-2 turbofans, it carried 164 passengers. About 42 were built.

; Tu-154A
: The first upgraded version of the original Tu-154, the A model, in production since 1974, added center-section fuel tanks and more emergency exits, while engines were upgraded to higher-thrust Kuznetsov NK-8-2U. Other upgrades include automatic flaps/slats and stabilizer controls and modified avionics. Max. takeoff weight – . There were 15 different interior layouts for the different domestic and international customers, seating between 144 and 152 passengers. To discern the A model from the base model note the spike at the junction of the fin and tail. This is a fat bullet on the A model, and a slender spike on the base model.

; Tu-154B
: As the original Tu-154 and Tu-154A suffered wing cracks after a few years in service, a version with a new, stronger wing, designated Tu-154B, went into production in 1975. It also had an additional fuselage fuel tank, additional emergency exits in the tail. Also, the maximum takeoff weight increased to . Important to Aeroflot was the increased passenger capacity, hence lower operating costs. With the NK-8-2U engines the only way to improve the economics of the airplane was to spread costs across more seats. The autopilot was certified for ICAO Category II automatic approaches. Most previously built Tu-154 and Tu-154A were also modified into this variant, with the replacement of the wing. Maximum takeoff weight increased to . 111 were built.

; Tu-154B-1
: Aeroflot wanted this version for increased revenue on domestic routes. It carried 160 passengers. This version also had some minor modifications to the fuel system, avionics, air conditioning, and landing gear. 64 were built from 1977 to 1978.

; Tu-154B-2
: A minor modernization of Tu-154B-1. The airplane was designed to be converted from the 160 passenger version to a 180 passenger version by removing the galley. The procedure took about hours. Some of the earlier Tu-154Bs were modified to that standard. Maximum takeoff weight increased to , later to . Some 311 aircraft were built, including VIP versions. A few remain in service.

; Tu-154S
: The Tu-154S is an all-cargo or freighter version of the Tu-154B, using a strengthened floor, and adding a forward cargo door on the port side of the fuselage. The aircraft could carry nine Soviet PAV-3 pallets. Maximum payload – . There were plans for 20 aircraft, but only nine were converted, two from Tu-154 models and seven from Tu-154B models. Trials were held in the early 1980s and the aircraft was authorized regular operations in 1984. By 1997 all had been retired.

; Tu-154M
: The Tu-154M and Tu-154M Lux are the most highly upgraded versions, which first flew in 1982 and entered mass production in 1984. It uses more fuel-efficient Soloviev D-30KU-154 turbofans. Together with significant aerodynamic refinement, this led to much lower fuel consumption hence longer range, as well as lower operating costs. The aircraft has new double-slotted (instead of triple-slotted) flaps, with an extra 36-degree position (in addition to existing 15, 28 and 45-degree positions on older versions), which allows reduction of noise on approach. It also has a relocated auxiliary power unit and numerous other improvements. Maximum takeoff weight increased first to , then to . Some aircraft are certified to . About 320 were manufactured. Mass production ended in 2006, though limited manufacturing continued as of January 2009. No new airframes have been built since the early 1990s, and production since then involved assembling aircraft from components on hand. Chinese Tu-154MD electronic intelligence aircraft carry a large-size synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) under their mainframe.

; Tu-154M-LK-1
: Cosmonaut trainer. This was a salon VIP aircraft modified to train cosmonauts to fly the Buran reusable spacecraft, the Soviet equivalent of the US Space Shuttle. The Tu-154 was used because the Buran required a steep descent, which the Tu-154 was capable of replicating. The cabin featured trainee workstations, one of which was identical to the Buran&#x27;s flightdeck. The forward baggage compartment was converted into a camera bay, as the aircraft was used to train cosmonauts in observation and photographic techniques.

; Tu-154M-ON monitoring aircraft
: Germany modified one of the Tu-154s it inherited from the former East German Air Force into an observation airplane. This aircraft was involved with the Open Skies inspection flights. It was converted at the Elbe Aircraft Plant (Elbe Flugzeugwerke) in Dresden, and flew in 1996. After 24 monitoring missions, it was lost in a mid-air collision in 1997.

: The Russians also converted a Tu-154M to serve as an Open Skies monitoring aircraft. They used the Tu-154M-LK-1, and converted it to a Tu-154M-ON. When not flying over North America, it is used to ferry cosmonauts. China is believed to have converted one Tu-154 to an electronic countermeasures aircraft.

; Tu-154M-100
: Design of this variant started in 1994, but the first aircraft were not delivered until 1998. It is an upgraded version with Western avionics, including the Flight Management Computer, GPS, EGPWS, TCAS, and other modern systems. The airplane could carry up to 157 passengers. The cabin featured an automatic oxygen system and larger overhead bins. Three were produced, as payment of debts owed by Russia to Slovakia. Three aircraft were delivered in 1998 to Slovak Airlines, and sold back to Russia in 2003.

; Tu-155
: A Tu-154 converted into a testbed for alternative fuels. It first flew in 1988 and was used until the fall of the Soviet Union, when it was placed in storage.

; Tu-156
: Proposed conversions of three Tu-154s with Kuznetsov NK-89 turbofans running on liquid natural gas. Not proceeded with. 

; Tu-164
: Initial designation of the Tu-154M.

; Tu-174
: Proposed stretched version of Tu-154.

; Tu-194
: Proposed shortened version of Tu-154.

==Operators==

===Current operators===
As of August 2017, there were 44 Tupolev Tu-154 aircraft of all variants still in civil, governmental or military service.

A 45th aircraft has been sighted flying with Air Kyrgyzstan in 2017, but is not listed by the airline as part of its fleet. A 46th aircraft, a Polish Tu-154 with operational number 102, is currently in storage at the military airport in Mińsk Mazowiecki. It was operated by 36th Special Aviation Regiment, but after the 2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash of the Tu-154 101, the Regiment has been disbanded and the plane was grounded. It was fully operational, but the government decided not to use or sell it until the investigation into the Smoleńsk crash is finished. As of June 2021 the aircraft is not flying, and it is unlikely to come back into service, since the government operates a fleet of brand-new, more fuel-efficient jets like the Gulfstream G550 and the Boeing 737 NG. In 2020 it was revealed by the investigation team, led by Antoni Macierewicz, that the aircraft was structurally damaged. The access to the aircraft was restricted by the general prosecutor, and entering its hangar requires a special permission.

As of June 2015, the remaining operators were:

===Operational history===
In January 2010 Russian flag carrier Aeroflot announced the retirement of its Tu-154 fleet after 40 years, with the last scheduled flight being Aeroflot Flight 736 from Yekaterinburg to Moscow on 31 December 2009. In December 2010, Uzbekistan Airways also declared that it was retiring its Tu-154s. In February 2011, all remaining Iranian Tu-154s were grounded after two incidents.

On 27 December 2016, the Russian Ministry of Defence announced that it had grounded all of its Tu-154s until the end of the investigation into the December 2016 crash of a 1983 Tupolev Tu-154. This was followed by the grounding of all Tu-154s in Russia. The Tu-154 had crashed into the Black Sea just after takeoff from Sochi, Russia, on 25 December 2016 killing all 92 people on board, including 64 members of the Alexandrov Ensemble, an official army choir of the Russian Armed Forces.

In October 2020 ALROSA, the last Russian passenger airline to operate this aircraft, retired its last remaining Tu-154.

==Incidents and accidents==
Between 1970 and December 2016 there were 110 serious incidents involving the Tu-154, including 73 hull losses, with 2,911 fatalities. Of the fatal incidents, five resulted from terrorist or military terrorist action (two other wartime losses were non-fatal), several from poor runway conditions in winter (including one in which the airplane struck snow plows on the runway), cargo overloading in the lapse of post-Soviet federal safety standards, and mid-air collisions due to faulty air traffic control. Other incidents resulted from mechanical problems, running out of fuel on unscheduled routes, pilot errors (including inadequate flight training for new crews), and cargo fires; several accidents remain unexplained.

On 2 January 2011, Russia&#x27;s Federal Transport Oversight Agency advised airlines to stop using remaining examples of the Tu-154 (B variant) until the fatal fire incident in Surgut had been investigated. Its operation in Iran ceased in February 2011 due to a number of crashes and incidents involving the type (almost 9% of all Tu-154 losses have occurred in Iran). This grounding compounded the effects of US embargo on civil aircraft parts, substantially decreasing the number of airworthy aircraft in the Iranian civil fleet. In 2010 there were two fatal losses of the Tu-154 due to pilot error and/or weather conditions (a Polish presidential jet attempting a rural airfield landing in heavy fog, the 2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash, and a Russian-registered plane that suffered engine stall after a crew member accidentally de-activated a fuel transfer pump). Following these accidents, in March 2011 the Russian Federal Bureau of Aviation recommended a withdrawal of remaining Tu-154Ms from service.

On 27 December 2016, the Russian Defence Ministry grounded all Tu-154s in Russia pending investigation into the 25 December 2016 Tupolev Tu-154 crash which killed 64 members of the Alexandrov Ensemble, an official Red Army Choir of the Russian Armed Forces.

<text>Inuvik (&quot;place of man&quot;) is the only town in the Inuvik Region, and the third largest community in Canada&#x27;s Northwest Territories. Located in what is sometimes called the Beaufort Delta Region, it serves as the region&#x27;s administrative and service centre. Inuvik is home to federal, territorial, and Indigenous government offices, along with a regional hospital and airport.

Inuvik is located on the northern edge of a boreal forest just before it begins to transition to tundra. It is on the east side of the enormous Mackenzie River delta. The town lies within the Gwich&#x27;in Settlement Region and the Inuvialuit Settlement Region.

== History ==
Inuvik was conceived in 1953 as a replacement administrative centre for the hamlet of Aklavik on the west of the Mackenzie Delta, as the latter was prone to flooding and had no room for expansion. Initially called &quot;New Aklavik&quot;, it was renamed Inuvik in 1958. The school was built in 1959 and the hospital, government offices and staff residences in 1960, when people, including Inuvialuit, Gwichʼin (Dene) and Métis, began to live in the community.

Naval Radio Station (NRS) Inuvik, later CFS Inuvik, callsign CFV, was commissioned on 10 September 1963 after operations had been successfully transferred from NRS Aklavik. Station CFV was part of the SUPRAD (Supplementary Radio) network of intercept and direction finding stations.

CFS Inuvik closed on 1 April 1986 and the site was transferred to the Department of Transport for use as a telecommunications station. Nothing remains of CFS Inuvik today. The Navy Operations base at the end of Navy Road was completely dismantled and removed.

Inuvik achieved village status in 1967 and became a full town in 1979 with an elected mayor and council. In 1979, with the completion of the Dempster Highway, Inuvik became connected to Canada&#x27;s highway system, and simultaneously the most northerly town to which one could drive in Canada. While a winter only ice road through the Mackenzie River delta still connects Inuvik to Aklavik, southwest of Inuvik, the Tuktoyaktuk Winter Road, which ran northeast to Tuktoyaktuk, is no longer being built due to the opening in November 2017, of the Inuvik–Tuktoyaktuk Highway (ITH), which is open all year round. The Inuvik to Tuktoyaktuk highway, which connects to Canada&#x27;s highway system at Inuvik via the Dempster Highway, is the first road in history to reach the Arctic Ocean in North America.

Between 1971 and 1990, the town&#x27;s economy was supported by the local Canadian Armed Forces Station, CFS Inuvik, (originally a Naval Radio Station, later a communications research/signals intercept facility) and by petrochemical companies exploring the Mackenzie Valley and the Beaufort Sea for petroleum. This all collapsed in 1990 for a variety of reasons, including disappearing government military subsidies, local resistance to petroleum exploration, and low international oil prices. Since then the economy has been based on some minor tourism and subsidy provided by the Crown–Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC), Health Canada (for the regional hospital) and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

== Demographics ==

In the 2021 Canadian census conducted by Statistics Canada, Inuvik had a population of 3,137 living in 1,223 of its 1,464 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 3,243. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

=== Ethnicity ===
As of the 2021 Canadian census there were 1,990 people who identified as Indigenous. Of these 63.6 per cent were Inuvialuit (Inuit, predominantly Uummarmiut), 26.1 per cent First Nations, 5.8 per cent Métis and 4.8 per cent reported other Indigenous heritage. The non-Indigenous population of Inuvik was 36.6 per cent. Local Gwichʼin are enrolled in the Inuvik Native Band.

=== Language ===
The main language spoken in Inuvik is English, though schools teach and a handful of local people still speak Inuinnaqtun (Inuvialuktun), and Gwichʼin. Local CBC Radio, CHAK (AM), broadcasts an hour of programming a day in each of these languages.

=== Religion ===
There are also about 100 Muslims, most of whom came there for economic opportunities. A small mosque (dubbed &quot;Little mosque on the tundra&quot; in reference to the CBC show &quot;Little Mosque on the Prairie&quot;) was established in 2010.

== Geography ==

Inuvik is located on the East Channel of the Mackenzie Delta, approximately from the Arctic Ocean and approximately north of the Arctic Circle. The tree line lies north of Inuvik, and the town is surrounded by boreal forest.

Due to its northern location, Inuvik experiences an average of 56 days of midnight sun every summer and 30 days of polar night every winter.

==Transportation==

===Road===
Until November 2017, Inuvik was the most northern community in Canada to be accessible by road (now second to Tuktoyaktuk). The Dempster Highway links Inuvik to the rest of Canada, providing relatively easy access to a wide variety of goods, and greatly reducing their cost. In contrast, many Arctic communities depend on cargo flights for regular goods and summer sealifts for larger freight, making goods expensive and often slow to arrive.
In 2017, the Inuvik–Tuktoyaktuk Highway was extended north from Inuvik another to Tuktoyaktuk on the Arctic coast. Inuvik is also connected to Aklavik by an ice road across the Mackenzie Delta from late December until late April each year.

The Dempster Highway relies on ferries to cross the Peel River near Fort McPherson and the Mackenzie River at Tsiigehtchic during the summer. In winter, ice bridges are constructed to cross the rivers. During the spring the crossings close throughout May as the ice on the rivers breaks up. Similarly, they are impassible for most of November while the rivers freeze.
During these times air travel is the only way for people and goods to reach Inuvik.

===Air===
The Inuvik (Mike Zubko) Airport is serviced by several regional carriers. Canadian North has regular direct flights to Yellowknife and Norman Wells. It further connects to Edmonton, and a number of smaller communities in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut.
Air North connects to points in the Yukon and travels as far south as Vancouver.
Aklak Air flies north to the small communities of Sachs Harbour, Paulatuk, and Ulukhaktok.
Freight services, helicopters, and floatplane charters are also available from Inuvik. Floatplane service operates out of the nearby Inuvik/Shell Lake Water Aerodrome.

===Water===
When the Mackenzie River is ice-free, Marine Transportation Services provides a commercial barge service from Hay River, on Great Slave Lake to the regional terminal in Inuvik. The annual sealift moves supplies east into the Kitikmeot Region of Nunavut and west to Utqiagvik, Alaska.
Many locals own small boats with outboard motors which are used to access family hunting and fishing camps or to visit Aklavik. Boat traffic comes to a halt in the winter when the Mackenzie River freezes.

==Climate==
Inuvik has a subarctic climate (Köppen &quot;Dfc&quot;, Trewartha &quot;Eclc/Ecld&quot;). Summers are typically wetter and cool, with temperatures varying wildly throughout the months due to its peculiar location near the cold Arctic Ocean. The average hottest month of the year, July, has a mean high of and mean low of . Unlike many other North American continental climates, Inuvik warms up very quickly during May and June due to the rapidly increasing day length, and that remaining snow cools down until May. June is a warmer month than August.

Seasonal transitions are extremely short, with mean daily temperatures rising or falling as fast as per day. Winters are long and cold; the coldest month of the year, January, having a mean high of and a mean low of . Freezing temperatures can occur any month of the year. Inuvik has a great variation of temperatures during the year, usually peaking below in the winter and above in the summer. The highest temperature ever recorded in Inuvik was on 7 August 2024. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 4 February 1968.

Snow that falls from October onward usually stays until the spring thaw in mid-May but can sometimes last until June.

== Tourism ==

=== Famous attractions ===
Inuvik&#x27;s Our Lady of Victory Church, often called &quot;Igloo Church&quot;, is a famous landmark in the region. It is the most-photographed building in the town .

Inuvik has the Midnight Sun Mosque, North America&#x27;s northernmost, which opened in November 2010 after being built in Winnipeg and moved by truck and barge. Some media reports have mistakenly called the mosque &quot;the world&#x27;s northernmost mosque&quot;, but in fact the Nord Kamal Mosque in Norilsk, Russia, and a mosque in Tromsø, Norway, are both slightly further north than Inuvik.

=== Annual events of note ===
The Great Northern Arts Festival has been held annually for 10 days in the middle of July since 1989. The Festival has hosted over 3,000 artists from across Canada&#x27;s north, and from as far away as Japan and Australia over 31 years and is the largest annual tourism event in the Beaufort Delta. Featuring on-site demonstrations, 50+ arts workshops, a 3,500-piece gallery, an outdoor carving village, an interactive artist studio zone, nightly cultural performances, northern film screenings, family activities and an Arctic fashion show, the Festival attracts visitors from around the world to travel the Dempster Highway to visit Inuvik and the Gwich&#x27;in and Inuvialuit Settlement Regions.

The annual Sunrise Festival happens on the second weekend of the new year, when the sun finally breaks the horizon after about thirty days of polar night. The Festival is an all-day community event highlighted by dog sled races, a long-program fireworks show and community bonfire. This Festival was highlighted in the award-winning 2010 national Tropicana Orange Juice commercial &quot;Arctic Sun&quot;.

Inuvik celebrates the Muskrat Jamboree each year in late March or early April. Started in 1957, the event brings together thousands of people to participate in traditional games, watch the dog sled and snowmobile races and dance (jig) the night away in town. Most events are held on the Mackenzie River where several community groups operate concessions in stove-heated traditional McPherson tents, preparing hot soup, bannock, baked goods, coffee, Labrador tea, hot chocolate and other traditional refreshments. Many participants and spectators wear traditional clothing and often local artisans will have something to sell. In conjunction with the Muskrat Jamboree, the Town of Inuvik hosts the annual Muskrat Cup 3-on-3 Pond Hockey Tournament on the frozen Mackenzie River, the world&#x27;s most northerly cash tournament.

The weekend closest to the summer solstice (21 June) each year features the Midnight Sun Fun Run, a 5K, 10K and half marathon that starts at midnight under the 24-hours of sunlight experienced for over 50 days each summer in Inuvik. Runners from around the world make their way north to participate in this unique event under the midnight sun.

==Facilities==

A new hospital opened in early 2003, providing service to an area extending from Sachs Harbour on Banks Island, to Ulukhaktok on Victoria Island, and from Paulatuk into the Sahtu Region including Norman Wells, Tulita, Délı̨nę, Fort Good Hope, and Colville Lake.

The Midnight Sun Complex, a stage-built multi-use facility, was completed in 2006. Featuring the Roy &#x27;Sugloo&#x27; Ipana Memorial Arena, with an NHL-sized ice surface; the Inuvik Curling Club with three sheets and a well-situated licensed lounge/viewing area; the Inuvik Pool, an award-winning Class B recreational pool with lane swimming, waterpark features including a two-story waterslide, hot tub, sauna and steam room; two squash courts; a multi-use community hall with stage; on-site business centre/production office; full building wireless; video-conferencing facility; on-site catering/kitchen; and meeting rooms for groups of 5 to 500. At full-building use, the Complex can host conferences, conventions and trade shows with up to 1200 delegates/exhibitors.

The community has a state-of-the-art school called East 3. The construction budget for the school exceeded $110 million, and it features modern technologies such as &#x27;smartboards&#x27; and videoconferencing facilities as well as a large gym.

A distinct feature of Inuvik is the use of &quot;utilidors&quot; – above-ground utility conduits carrying water and sewage – which are covered by corrugated steel. They run throughout town connecting most buildings, and as a result there are many small bridges and underpasses. The utilidors are necessary because of the permafrost underlying the town.

==Media==

===Print===
The town is served by the &quot;Inuvik Drum&quot;, a community newspaper published weekly by Northern News Services.

===Television===
Inuvik was previously served by CHAK-TV, VHF channel 6, a CBC North television repeater of CFYK-DT (Yellowknife). That station closed on 31 July 2012 due to budget cuts affecting the CBC.

===Radio===
==Communications==
Landline telephone service is provided by Northwestel, and cellular service by Ice Wireless and Arctic Digital (Bell Mobility). Cable television is also offered in Inuvik by New North Networks.

Fibre optic communications were added in Inuvik in June 2017 with the completion of the Mackenzie Valley Fibre Link; the $82 million line adds new capability to the town. However, the dependence on this single trunk line occasionally causes widespread Internet outages during Dempster or Alaska Highway maintenance or construction. A backup trunk line between Fort Simpson and Inuvik was under construction as of 2015.

== Planetary nomenclature ==

In 1988, the International Astronomical Union&#x27;s Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature (IAU / WGPSN) officially adopted the name Inuvik for a crater on Mars, at 78.7° north latitude and 28.6° west longitude. The crater&#x27;s diameter is .

<text>The North American F-100 Super Sabre is an American supersonic jet fighter aircraft designed and produced by the aircraft manufacturer North American Aviation. The first of the Century Series of American jet fighters, it was the first United States Air Force (USAF) fighter capable of supersonic speed in level flight.

The F-100 was envisioned during the late 1940s as a higher-performance successor to the F-86 Sabre air superiority fighter. Initially referred to as the &quot;Sabre 45&quot;, it was delivered as an unsolicited proposal to the USAF in January 1951, leading to two prototypes being ordered one year later following modifications. The first &quot;YF-100A&quot; performed its maiden flight on 25 May 1953, seven months ahead of schedule. Flight testing demonstrated both the F-100&#x27;s promising performance and several deficiencies, which included its tendency of yaw instability and inertia coupling that led to numerous fatal accidents. On 27 September 1954, the F-100A officially entered USAF service, however, as a result of six major accidents occurred by 10 November 1954, the type was grounded while investigations and remedial work were conducted. The F-100 returned to flight in February 1955.

In response to the Tactical Air Command&#x27;s (TAC) request for a fighter-bomber, the F-100C was developed, followed by the more capable F-100D. Several other models would be developed, including the two-seat F-100F supersonic trainer. As early as 1958, the USAF began to withdraw its F-100As, but returned them to service during early 1962 amid escalating world tensions. Many F-100s saw combat use during the Vietnam War before being superseded by the high-speed Republic F-105 Thunderchief in the strike mission. The F-100 flew extensively over South Vietnam as the air force&#x27;s primary close air support aircraft until being replaced by the more capable subsonic LTV A-7 Corsair II, General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark, and the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II. 242 F-100s of various models were lost over Vietnam. Several F-100As were rebuilt into RF-100A aerial reconnaissance aircraft. Several F-100Fs were modified into electronic warfare platforms. Several proposed models and derivatives, such as the F-100B interceptor and the F-107, did not proceed through to production.

Amid a relatively high attrition rate and the arrival of more advanced fighters, the USAF opted to permanently withdraw its remaining F-100s during the early 1970s. The type was also operated by the Air National Guard (ANG) until 1979. The F100 was exported to several overseas operators, including NATO air forces and other U.S. allies, including the Turkish Air Force, Republic of China Air Force, and the French Air Force. The F-100 was deployed during the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, performing close air support missions. French F-100s also saw action during the Algerian War. During its later life, the F-100 was often referred to as the &quot;Hun&quot;, a shortened version of &quot;one hundred&quot;.

==Development==
===Background===
The F-100 can be traced back to an internal design study performed by North American Aviation as early as 1949. It was named &quot;Sabre 45&quot; in reference to its 45° wing sweep and essentially represented an evolution of the company&#x27;s successful F-86 Sabre. In January 1951, the company delivered an unsolicited proposal for a supersonic day fighter to the United States Air Force (USAF). On 7 July 1951, a mockup of the aircraft was presented for inspection; the USAF produced a general operational requirement that called for an air superiority weapon to be operational no later than 1957, preferably by 1955. During October 1951, the Air Force Council advocated for the development of a refined model of the Sabre 45; furthermore, it agreed with the Aircraft and Weapons Board&#x27;s recommendation that it be purchased in quantity even prior to flight testing despite the risks involved in this approach.

By mid-November 1951, in excess of 100 aircraft configuration change requests had been received, necessitating numerous modifications to the original design; several of these alterations were focused on its armaments and were intended to improve its lethality. The new aircraft was accepted as the F-100 on 30 November 1951. On 3 January 1952, the USAF placed an order for two prototypes; one month later, a follow-on production order was issued for 23 F-100As while an additional 250 F-100As were ordered in August of that year as well. Around this time, development work slowed considerably while North American focused on improving and ramping up production of the F-86 in response to urgent demands for more aircraft to participate in the Korean War.

===Into flight===
On 25 May 1953, North American Aviation Chief Test Pilot George Welch conducted the first flight of the YF-100A, seven months ahead of schedule. Once level at 35,000 feet he accelerated to supersonic speed, leaving his chase pilot, ”Pete” Everest well behind in his F-86D. As such, he was the first person to exceed Mach 1 in level flight in a jet. During one of its early test flights, the first prototype reached a maximum of Mach 1.05 in spite of being fitted with a derated Pratt &amp; Whitney XJ57-P-7 engine. By September, flight testing had confirmed the presence of three major deficiencies in the design, all of which required correction ahead of it being considered as acceptable. On 14 October 1953, the second prototype flew for the first time, followed by the first production F-100A on 29 October 1953. This first F-100A was put through extensive testing to help develop fixes for identified deficiencies. Progress on the project was set back by a three-month general strike by North American employees in late 1953.

An operational evaluation of the F-100A was conducted by the USAF November 1953 and December 1955, it determined that the new aircraft possessed superior performance to existing USAF fighters, but declared that it was not ready for widescale deployment due to various deficiencies and functional difficulties in the design. These findings were subsequently confirmed during operational suitability tests performed under &quot;Project Hot Rod&quot;. During August 1954, six F-100s arrived at the Air Proving Ground Command (APGC), Eglin Air Force Base. The Air Force Operational Test Center (AFOTC) used four of the fighters for operational suitability tests while the other two aircraft underwent armament tests by the Air Force Armament Center. The Tactical Air Division of the AFOTC conducted the APGC testing under the direction of project office Lieutenant Colonel Henry W. Brown; initial testing was completed by APGC personnel at Edwards Air Force Base.

Despite these shortcomings, the Tactical Air Command (TAC) advocated for the F-100 as a matter of urgency, particularly in light of delays experienced in the Republic F-84F Thunderstreak program; furthermore, TAC recommended the production of a day fighter with a secondary fighter-bomber capability that would be suitable not only for the USAF but also foreign nations covered by the Mutual Development Assistance Program. Accordingly, during December 1953, the Air Council opted to alter the program, reducing the outstanding total orders for the F-100A by 70 aircraft in favor of a new fighter-bomber variant that would be capable of delivering nuclear bombs. In February 1954, the USAF would issue the first production contract for this fighter-bomber model, the &quot;F-100C&quot;; equipped to carry additional munitions and fuel tanks, the prototype performed its maiden flight one month later while the first production aircraft followed in January 1955.

In response to observed improvements in fighters deployed by the Soviet Union, the USAF directed production of the F-100 to be accelerated via the establishment of a second production line in Columbus in September 1954. During November 1954, production of the F-100 was reduced to 24 aircraft per month in response to a spate of fatal accidents. Aircraft already built were stored and the corrections were applied later. Following appropriate remedial work, the USAF opted to partially lift its restrictions on both production and flights of the F-100 in February 1955; deliveries resumed two months later.

===Further development===
Various adaptions and derivatives of the F-100 were considered during its development. During mid-1954, an interceptor model of the aircraft was being studied; in July of that year, a mockup of the envisioned &quot;F-110B1&quot; was completed, it was intended as a backup for the in-development Convair F-102 Delta Dagger interceptor. However, the difficulties experienced with the F-100A were viewed as evidence that the aircraft, even in the face of expected improvements, would be incapable of satisfying the operational requirement to a greater degree than that of the F-102.

The definitive model would be the F-100D. During May 1954, the TAC had requested a more sophisticated fighter-bomber; the company aimed to address the offensive shortcomings of the F-100C by being primarily a ground-attack aircraft with secondary fighter capabilities. To achieve this, the aircraft was fitted with autopilot, upgraded avionics, and starting with the 184th production aircraft, compatibility with the AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missile. To further address the dangerous flight characteristics, the wingspan was extended by 26 in (66 cm) and the vertical tail area was increased by 27%. In October 1954, an initial production contract was issued for the F-100D, follow-on contracts would be issued in March and December of the following year. On 24 January 1956, the first F-100D (54–2121) flew, piloted by Daniel Darnell.

In December 1954, a new General Operational Requirement, GOR 68, was issued by the USAF; it called for a tactical fighter-bomber that would also be effective as an aerial superiority fighter under both day and night conditions. North American opted to respond with a heavily modified version of the F-100; the design was so substantially different that it was promptly decided to redesignate it as the F-107. Intended for speeds as high as Mach 2, the aircraft could be easily distinguished from the F-100 by the placement of the air intake above and behind the cockpit. It was not ultimately produced in quantity, having been passed over in favor of the competing Republic F-105 Thunderchief.

On 8 September 1955, North American proposed modifying an F-100C into a two-seat trainer model at no expense to the USAF; two months later, the air council decided to produce the type, perceiving a need for a supersonic trainer. During December 1955, an initial production contract for the F-100F trainer was placed. The prototype &quot;TF-100C&quot;, which lacked most operational equipment, made its first flight on 6 August 1956; it was followed by the first production aircraft on 7 March 1957.

==Design==

The North American F-100 Super Sabre is a supersonic fighter aircraft. It was one of the first aircraft with a stabilator, or all-moving tailplane. Unlike modern stabilators which use an anti-servo tab, gearing and a variable stiffness spring were attached to the control stick to provide acceptable resistance to prevent pilot-induced oscillation. Unusually, the aircraft made extensive use of titanium throughout key areas of the airframe.

The F-100 exhibited several concerning handling difficulties, especially early on in its flying career. Particularly troubling was the yaw instability in certain flight conditions, which produced inertia coupling. The aircraft could develop a sudden yaw and roll, occurring too rapidly for the pilot to correct and would quickly overstress the aircraft&#x27;s structure, leading to disintegration. It was under these conditions that North American&#x27;s chief test pilot, George Welch, was killed while dive testing an early-production F-100A (s/n 52-5764) on 12 October 1954. Several early modifications were made to address the problem, including the integration of black boxes with the yaw and pitch axis, the reshaping of the vertical tail surfaces, shortening of the tailfin, and increased chord of the rudder. Another control problem suffered by the type stemmed from the handling characteristics of the swept wing at high angles of attack: as the aircraft approached stall speeds, loss of lift on the tips of the wings caused a violent pitch-up. This particular phenomenon (which could easily be fatal at low altitude with insufficient time to recover) became known as the &quot;Sabre dance&quot;.

The F-100 was the subject of many modification programs over the course of its service. Many of these were improvements to electronics, structural strengthening, and projects to improve ease of maintenance. One of these was the replacement of the original afterburners of the J-57 engines with the more advanced afterburners from retired Convair F-102 Delta Dagger interceptors. This modification changed the appearance of the aft end of the F-100, doing away with the original &quot;petal-style&quot; exhaust. The afterburner modification started in the 1970s and solved maintenance problems with the old type, as well as operational problems, including compressor stall problems.

==Operational history==
On 27 September 1954, the F-100A officially entered USAF service with the 479th Fighter Wing, based at George AFB, California. By 10 November 1954, the F-100As had suffered six major accidents due to a combination of factors, including flight instability, structural failures, and hydraulic failures, prompting the USAF to ground the entire fleet. During February 1955, the F-100A resumed flight while the 479th was finally declared operational in September 1955. Due to ongoing problems with the type, the USAF opted to start phasing out the F-100A during 1958. Many of these aircraft were reallocated to Air National Guard (ANG) units while others were given to the Chinese Nationalist Air Force.

During 1961, the withdrawal of all USAF F-100As had been completed; by that time, 47 aircraft had been lost in major accidents. However, as a result of escalating world tensions in response to the Berlin Wall&#x27;s construction in August 1961, the USAF was compelled to recall the F-100As into active service. During early 1962, it was decided to extend the type&#x27;s service life. However, the F-100A was largely used for aircrew training during this time. Due to attrition, the ANG ceased operating the F-100A during 1967 while the USAF opted to permanently retire the model in early 1970.

The F-100C fighter-bomber entered service on 14 July 1955 with the 450th Fighter Wing at Foster AFB, Texas. Operational testing in 1955 revealed that the F-100C was at best an interim solution, sharing all the flaws of the F-100A. The uprated J57-P-21 engine boosted performance, although it continued to suffer from compressor stalls, but the F-100C was considered an excellent platform for nuclear toss bombing because of its high top speed. The inertia coupling problem was reasonably addressed with the installation of a yaw damper in the 146th F-100C, which was later retrofitted to earlier aircraft. A pitch damper was added, starting with the 301st F-100C, at a cost of US$10,000 per aircraft.

The addition of &quot;wet&quot; hardpoints meant the F-100C could carry a pair of 275 U.S. gal (1,040 L) and a pair of 200 U.S. gal (770 L) drop tanks. However, the combination caused a loss of directional stability at high speeds, so the four tanks were soon replaced by a pair of 450 U.S. gal (1,730 L) drop tanks. The 450s proved scarce and expensive and were often replaced by smaller 335 US gal (1,290 L) tanks. Most troubling to TAC was the fact that, as of 1965, only 125 F-100Cs were capable of using all non-nuclear weapons in the USAF inventory, particularly cluster bombs and AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. By the time the F-100C was phased out in June 1970, 85 had been lost in major accidents.

The F-100D entered service on 29 September 1956 with the 405th Fighter Wing at Langley AFB. The model exhibited reliability problems from the onset, particularly with the constant-speed inverter which provided constant-frequency current to the electrical systems. This unit was so unreliable that the USAF required it to have its own oil system to minimize damage in case of failure. Landing gear and brake parachute malfunctions claimed several aircraft while the refueling probes had a tendency to break away during high-speed maneuvers. During 1959, 65 aircraft were modified to also fire the AGM-12 Bullpup air-to-ground missile. Numerous post-production fixes created such a diversity of capabilities between individual aircraft that by 1965, around 700 F-100Ds underwent High Wire modifications to standardize the weapon systems.

On 26 March 1958, an F-100D fitted with an Astrodyne booster rocket making of thrust successfully performed a zero-length launch. This was accomplished by adding a large canister to the underside of the aircraft, which contained a black powder compound and was ignited electromechanically, driving the jet engine to minimal ignition point. This capability was incorporated into late-production aircraft.

The F-100F two-seat trainer was accepted into USAF service in January 1958. It received many of the same weapons and airframe upgrades as the F-100D, including the new afterburners. Various modifications, largely focused on the structure, were made during the F-100F&#x27;s service life; several were adapted with special equipment for electronic warfare operations and saw use in this capacity in Vietnam. By June 1970, 74 F-100Fs had been lost in major accidents. The pilot&#x27;s operating manual warned that the F-100F would not recover from a spin. The model was phased out of USAF service in 1972.

On July 15, 1958, the 354th Tactical Fighter Wing deployed 29 F-100Ds and Fs to Incirlik Air Base during the 1958 Lebanon crisis to support the Marine landing in Beirut to form a composite air strike force with B-57s, RB-66s, C-124s, RF-101s, and C-130s. In August, 1958, the USAF sent F-100Ds, F-101Cs, F-104As, and B-57Bs to Taiwan during the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis to demonstrate support for Taiwan.

By 1961, England AFB, Louisiana, (401st Tactical Wing) had four fighter-bomber squadrons, the 612th, 613th, 614th, and the 615th (Fighting Tigers). During the Berlin crisis (approximately September 1961), the 614th was deployed to Ramstein Air Base, Germany, to support the West Germans. At the initial briefing, the 614th personnel were informed that due to the close proximity of the USSR, if an ICBM were to be launched, they would have only 30 minutes to launch the 614th&#x27;s aircraft and retire to the nearest German bunker.

During the Cuban Missile Crisis, 181 F-100s of the 31st Tactical Fighter Wing, 401st TFW, and 474th TFW were deployed to Homestead Air Force Base as a deterrent and for a potential strike on Cuba during the crisis. On May 2, 1965, 18 USAF F-100s flew from Ramey Air Force Base in Puerto Rico to support Operation Power Pack flying 313 combat sorties before returning to Myrtle Beach on May 28.

In 1966, the Combat Skyspot program fitted some F-100Ds with an X band radar transmitter to allow for ground-directed bombing in inclement weather or at night. In 1967, the USAF began a structural reinforcement program to extend the aircraft&#x27;s service life from the designed 3,000 flying hours to 7,000. The USAF alone lost 500 F-100Ds, predominantly in accidents. After one aircraft suffered wing failure, particular attention was paid to lining the wings with external bracing strips. During the Vietnam War, combat losses constituted as many as 50 aircraft per year. After a major accident, the USAF Thunderbirds reverted from F-105 Thunderchiefs to the F-100D, which they operated from 1964 until it was replaced by the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II in 1968.

By 1972, the F-100 was mostly phased out of USAF active service and turned over to tactical fighter groups and squadrons in the ANG. In ANG units, the F-100 was eventually replaced by the F-4 Phantom II, LTV A-7D Corsair II, and Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II, with the last F-100 retiring in 1979 as the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon was phased in. In foreign service, the Royal Danish Air Force and Turkish Air Force F-100s soldiered on until 1982.

Over the lifetime of its USAF service, 889 F-100s were destroyed in accidents, resulting in the deaths of 324 pilots. The deadliest year for F-100 accidents was 1958, which saw 116 aircraft destroyed and 47 pilots killed.

After F-100s were withdrawn from service, a large number were converted into remote-controlled drones (QF-100) under the USAF Full Scale Aerial Target (FSAT) program for use as targets for various antiaircraft weapons, including missile-carrying fighters and fighter-interceptors, with FSAT operations being conducted primarily at Tyndall AFB, Florida. A few F-100s also found their way into civilian hands, primarily with defense contractors supporting USAF and NASA flight test activities at Edwards AFB, California.

===Project Slick Chick===
North American received a contract to modify six F-100As to RF-100As carrying five cameras, three Fairchild K-17 cameras (see Fairchild K-20 camera) in a trimetrogon mounting for photo mapping and two Fairchild K-38 cameras in a split vertical mounting with the cameras mounted horizontally, shooting via a mirror angled at 45° to reduce the effects of airframe vibrations. All gun armament was removed, and the cameras installed in the gun and ammunition bays were covered by a bulged fairing under the forward fuselage.

Pilots trained on the F-100A at Edwards Air Force Base and George Air Force Base in California and then at Palmdale Air Force Base for training with the actual RF-100As with which they would be deployed. Flight tests revealed that the RF-100A in its intended operational fit of four external tanks was lacking in directional and longitudinal stability, requiring careful handling and close attention to speed limitations for the drop tanks.

Once pilot training was completed in April 1955, three aircraft were deployed to Bitburg Air Base in Germany, flying to Brookley AFB in Mobile, Alabama, cocooned, loaded on an aircraft carrier and delivered to Short Brothers at Sydenham, Belfast, for reassembly and flight preparation. At Bitburg, they were assigned to Detachment 1 of the 7407th Support Squadron, and commenced operations flying over Eastern Bloc countries at high altitude (over 50,000 ft) to acquire intelligence on military targets. Many attempts were made to intercept these aircraft to no avail, with some photos of fighter airfields clearly showing aircraft climbing for attempted intercepts. The European detachment probably only carried out six missions between mid-1955 and mid-1956 when the Lockheed U-2 took over as the deep-penetration aerial reconnaissance asset.

Three RF-100As were also deployed to the 6021st Reconnaissance Squadron at Yokota Air Base in Japan, but details of operations there are not available. Two RF-100As were lost in accidents, one due to probable overspeeding, which caused the separation of one of the drop tanks and resulted in complete loss of control, and the other due to an engine flame-out. In mid-1958, all four remaining RF-100As were returned to the US and later supplied to the Republic of China Air Force in Taiwan.

===Project High Wire===
&quot;High Wire&quot; was a modernization program performed upon selected F-100Cs, F-100Ds and F-100Fs. It comprised two modifications - an electrical rewiring upgrade and a heavy maintenance and inspect-and-repair as necessary (IRAN) upgrade. Rewiring upgrade operations consisted of replacing old wiring and harnesses with improved maintainable designs. Heavy maintenance and IRAN included new kits, modifications, standardized configurations, repairs, replacements, and complete refurbishment.

This project required all new manuals and incremented (i.e. -85 to -86) block numbers. All later-production models, especially the F models, included earlier High Wire modifications. New manuals included colored illustrations and had the Roman numeral (I) added after the aircraft number (e.g. T.O. 1F-100D(I)-1S-120, 12 January 1970). High Wire modifications took 60 days per aircraft at a cost for the entire project of US$150 million.

===Vietnam War===

====Fighter and close air support missions====

On 16 April 1961, six Super Sabres were deployed from Clark Air Base in the Philippines to Don Muang Royal Thai Air Force Base in Thailand for air-defense purposes, the first F-100s to enter combat in Southeast Asia. From that date until their redeployment in 1971, the F-100s were the longest serving U.S. jet fighter-bomber to fight in the Vietnam War. They served as MiG combat air patrol (CAP) escorts for F-105 Thunderchiefs, Misty forward air control (FAC), and Wild Weasel anti-air defense aircraft over North Vietnam, and were then relegated to close air support and ground attacks within South Vietnam.

On 18 August 1964, the first F-100D shot down by ground fire, piloted by 1st Lt Colin A. Clarke, of the 428th TFS; Clarke ejected and survived. 
On 4 April 1965, as escorts protecting F-105s attacking the Thanh Hoa Bridge, F-100 Super Sabres fought the USAF&#x27;s first air-to-air jet combat duel in the Vietnam War, in which an F-100 piloted by Captain Donald W. Kilgus of the 416th Fighter Squadron shot down a North Vietnamese Air Force MiG-17, using cannon fire, while another fired AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles. The surviving North Vietnamese pilot confirmed three of the MiG-17s had been shot down. Although recorded by the U.S. Air Force as a probable kill, this represented the first aerial victory by the U.S. Air Force in Vietnam. The small force of four MiG-17s, though, had penetrated the escorting F-100s to claim two F-105s.

The F-100 was soon replaced by the F-4C Phantom II for MiG CAP, which pilots noted suffered for lacking built-in guns for dogfights.

The United States military in the Vietnam War was not known for using activated Army National Guard, Air National Guard, or other U.S. Reserve units, but rather, relying on conscription during the course of the war. During a confirmation hearing before Congress in 1973, Air Force General George S. Brown, who had commanded the 7th Air Force during the war, stated that five of the best Super Sabre squadrons in Vietnam were from the Air National Guard. This included the (120 TFS) of the Colorado Air National Guard, the 136 TFS of the New York Air National Guard TFS, the 174 TFS of the Iowa Air National Guard, and the 188 TFS of the New Mexico Air National Guard. The fifth unit was a regular AF squadron manned by mostly air national guardsmen.

The Air National Guard F-100 squadrons increased the regular USAF by nearly 100 Super Sabres in theater, averaging, for the Colorado ANG F-100s, 24 missions a day, delivering ordnance and munitions with a 99.5% reliability rate. From May 1968 to April 1969, the ANG Super Sabres flew more than 38,000 combat hours and more than 24,000 sorties. Between them, at the cost of seven F-100 Air Guard pilots killed (plus one staff officer) and the loss of 14 Super Sabres to enemy action, the squadrons expended over four million rounds of 20 mm shells, 30 million pounds of bombs and over 10 million pounds of napalm against their enemy.

The Hun was also deployed as a two-seat F-100F model, which served as a &quot;fast FAC&quot; or Misty FAC in North Vietnam and Laos, spotting targets for other fighter-bomber aircraft, performing road reconnaissance, and conducting search-and-rescue missions as part of the top-secret Commando Sabre project, based out of Phu Cat and Tuy Hoa air bases.

By the conflict&#x27;s end, 242 F-100s of various models had been lost in Vietnam, as the F-100 was progressively replaced by the F-4 Phantom II and the F-105 Thunderchief. The Hun had logged 360,283 combat sorties during the war and its wartime operations came to end on 31 July 1971. The four fighter wings with F-100s flew more combat sorties in Vietnam than over 15,000 North American P-51 Mustangs had flown during World War II. After 1967, they did not fly into North Vietnam as much and mainly performed close air-support missions for American units in the South. Despite the April 1965 dogfight, which the USAF classified as resulting in a &quot;probable&quot; kill, and no F-100 was ever officially credited with any aerial victories. No F-100 in Vietnam was lost to enemy fighters, but 186 were shot down by antiaircraft fire, seven were destroyed in Vietcong attacks on airbases, and 45 crashed in operational incidents.

====Wild Weasel====
The F-100 was also the first Wild Weasel air defense suppression aircraft, whose specially trained crews were tasked with locating and destroying enemy missile defenses. Four F-100F Wild Weasel Is were fitted with APR-25 vector radar homing and warning receivers, IR-133 panoramic receivers with greater detection range, and KA-60 panoramic cameras. The APR-25 could detect early-warning radars and emissions from SA-2 Guideline tracking and guidance systems. These aircraft deployed to Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand, in November 1965, began flying combat missions with the 388th Tactical Fighter Wing in December. They were joined by three more aircraft in February 1966. All Wild Weasel F-100Fs were eventually modified to fire the AGM-45 Shrike anti-radiation missile.

===Algerian war===

French Air Force Super Sabres of the EC 1/3 &quot;Navarre&quot; flew combat missions, striking from bases within France against targets in French Algeria. The planes were based at Reims, refueling at Istres on the return flight from Algeria. The F-100 was the main fighter-bomber operated by the French Air Force during the 1960s until the type was replaced by the SEPECAT Jaguar.

===Turkey===
Turkish Air Force F-100 units were used during the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974. Together with Lockheed F-104G Starfighters, they provided close air support to Turkish ground troops and bombed targets around Nicosia. 
Following previous intrusions in Soviet air space, on 24 August 1976, a pair of Turkish Air Force F-100s entered into the Soviet Union airspace. While three Su-15s were intercepting the intruders, a ground based Soviet SAM battery shot down one of the Turkish F-100s.
In March 1987, Turkish Super Sabres bombed PKK bases in northern Iraq. On 14 September 1983, a pair of Turkish Air Force F-100F Super Sabres of 182 Filo “Atmaca” penetrated Iraqi airspace. A Mirage F1EQ of the Iraqi Air Force intercepted the flight and fired a Super 530F-1 missile at them. One of the Turkish fighter jets (s/n 56-3903) was shot down and crashed in Zakho valley near the Turkish-Iraqi border. The plane&#x27;s pilots reportedly survived the crash and were returned to Turkey. The incident was not made public by either side, although some details surfaced in later years. The incident was revealed in 2012 by Turkish Defence Minister İsmet Yılmaz, in response to a parliamentary question by Republican People&#x27;s Party (CHP) MP Metin Lütfi Baydar in the aftermath of the downing of a Turkish F-4 Phantom II in Syria, in 2012.

===Taiwan===

Taiwan took delivery of 119 F-100As, 4 RF-100As, and 14 F-100Fs, and lost a number of F-100As and Fs in the course of service, but never lost a single RF-100A in either combat or accident. Those four RF-100As had never been sent on a reconnaissance mission over mainland China, as they could only produce photographic images of mediocre quality at best. Moreover, after each flying hour, the ground personnel had to spend over 100 hours on the aircraft maintenance. All of the RF-100As were returned to the US after one year and 11 months (1 January 1959 – 1 December 1960) in ROCAF service.

==Operators==
;
* Royal Danish Air Force
:&quot;Flyvevåbnet&quot; operated a total of 72 aircraft. 48 F-100Ds and 10 Fs were delivered to Denmark from 1959 to 1961 as MDAP equipment. The F-100 replaced the Republic F-84G Thunderjet as a strike fighter in three squadrons; 725, 727 and 730. The F-100s of Eskadrille 725 were replaced by Saab F-35 Draken in 1970 and in 1974 14 two-seated ex-USAF TF-100F were bought. The last Danish F-100s were retired from service in 1982, replaced by F-16s. The surviving MDAP F-100s were transferred to Turkey (21 F-100Ds and two F-100Fs), while six TF-100Fs were sold for target towing.
* French Air Force
:The &quot;Armée de l&#x27;Air&quot; was the first non-US air force to receive the F-100 Super Sabre. The first aircraft arrived in France on 1 May 1958. A total of 100 aircraft (85 F-100Ds and 15 F-100Fs) were supplied to France and assigned to the NATO 4th Allied Tactical Air Force. They were stationed at German-French bases. French F-100s were used on combat missions flying from bases in France against targets in Algeria. In 1967, France withdrew from NATO&#x27;s military command structure, and German-based F-100s were transferred to bases in France vacated by the USAF. The last unit using the F100D/F was the &quot;Escadron&quot; 4/11 Jura, based at Djibouti, which kept the Super Sabre until 1978.
* Republic of China Air Force
:The only non-US air force to operate the F-100A model. The first F-100 was delivered in October 1958. It was followed by 15 F-100As in 1959, and by 65 more F-100As in 1960. In 1961, four unarmed RF-100As were delivered. Additionally, 38 ex-USAF/Air National Guard F-100As were delivered later, to bring the total strength to 118 F-100As and four RF-100As. F-100As were retrofitted with the F-100D vertical tail with its AN/APS-54 tail-warning radar and equipped to launch Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. 
* Turkish Air Force

:The &quot;Turk Hava Kuvvetleri&quot; received 206 F-100C, D and F Super Sabres. Most came from USAF stocks, and 21 F-100Ds and two F-100Fs were supplied by Denmark. Turkish F-100s saw extensive action during the 1974 invasion of Cyprus.

<text>Taxus is a genus of coniferous trees or shrubs known as yews in the family Taxaceae. Yews occur around the globe in temperate zones of the northern hemisphere, northernmost in Norway and southernmost in the South Celebes. Some populations exist in tropical highlands.

The oldest known fossil species are from the Early Cretaceous.

== Morphology ==

They are relatively slow-growing and can be very long-lived, and reach heights of , with trunk girth averaging . They have reddish bark, lanceolate, flat, dark-green leaves long and broad, arranged spirally on the stem, but with the leaf bases twisted to align the leaves in two flat rows either side of the stem.

The male cones are globose, across, and shed their pollen in early spring. Yews are mostly dioecious, but occasional individuals can be variably monoecious, or change sex with time.

The seed cones are highly modified, each cone containing a single seed long partly surrounded by a modified scale which develops into a soft, bright red berry-like structure called an aril, long and wide and open at the end. The arils are mature 6–9 months after pollination, and with the seed contained are eaten by thrushes, waxwings and other birds, which disperse the hard seeds undamaged in their droppings; maturation of the arils is spread over 2–3 months, increasing the chances of successful seed dispersal.

== Taxonomy and systematics ==
Taxus is the Latin word for this tree and its wood that is used to make javelins. The Latin word is probably borrowed, via Greek &quot;tóxon&quot;, from &quot;taxša&quot;, the Scythian word used for &quot;yew&quot; and &quot;bow&quot; (cognate of Persian &quot;Taxš&quot; meaning bow) because the Scythians used its wood to make their bows.

All of the yews are very closely related to each other, and some botanists treat them all as subspecies or varieties of just one widespread species; under this treatment, the species name used is &quot;Taxus baccata&quot;, the first yew described scientifically.

&quot;Taxus&quot; species appear similar. Attempts at taxonomy vary from describing all yews as subspecies of &quot;T. baccata&quot;, as did RKF Pilger in 1903, to splitting species by even very small morphological differences, as did R. W. Spjut in 2007 with 25 species and over 50 varieties. Some species have traditionally been recognized by geographic distribution, but Asian species have been more difficult to classify. &quot;Taxus contorta&quot; in the Western Himalaya and &quot;Taxus sumatrana&quot; in Malesia are now generally agreed upon, but overlapping ranges in the Eastern Himalaya, China, and subtropical southeast Asia have led to greater confusion, with the species &quot;Taxus chinensis&quot;, &quot;Taxus mairei&quot;, and &quot;Taxus wallichiana&quot; being elucidated only in the 21st century with the aid of molecular phylogenetics.
The most distinct is the Sumatran yew (&quot;T. sumatrana&quot;, native to Sumatra and Celebes north to southernmost China), distinguished by its sparse, sickle-shaped yellow-green leaves. The Mexican yew (&quot;Taxus globosa&quot;, native to eastern Mexico south to Honduras) is also relatively distinct with foliage intermediate between Sumatran yew and the other species. The Florida yew, Mexican yew and Pacific yew are all rare species listed as threatened or endangered.

=== Distribution ===

Yews typically occur in the understory or canopy of moist temperate or tropical mountain forests. Elevation varies by latitude from in tropical forests to near sea level in its northernmost populations.
Yews are common in landscape architecture, giving rise to widespread naturalized populations in the United States. There, both &quot;T. baccata&quot; and &quot;Taxus cuspidata&quot; are common ornamental shrubs.

&quot;T. baccata&quot; appears throughout Europe and into western Asia. &quot;T. cuspidata&quot; occurs over much of East Asia, in China, Japan, Korea, and Sakhalin. &quot;Taxus brevifolia&quot; ranges in the United States from California to Montana and Alaska, while &quot;Taxus canadensis&quot; appears in the northeastern United States and southeast Canada.

===Phylogeny===
Below are cladograms showing the evolutionary relationships between yew species and their global distribution.
==Toxicity==

All species of yew contain highly poisonous taxine alkaloids, with some variation in the exact formula of the alkaloid between the species. All parts of the tree except the arils contain the alkaloid. The arils are edible and sweet, but the seed is dangerously poisonous; unlike birds, the human stomach can break down the seed coat and release the toxins into the body. This can have fatal results if yew &#x27;berries&#x27; are eaten without removing the seeds first. Grazing animals, particularly cattle and horses, are also sometimes found dead near yew trees after eating the leaves, though deer are able to break down the poisons and will eat yew foliage freely. In the wild, deer browsing of yews is often so extensive that wild yew trees are commonly restricted to cliffs and other steep slopes inaccessible to deer. The foliage is also eaten by the larvae of some Lepidopteran insects including the moth willow beauty.
===Allergenic potential===

All parts of a yew plant are toxic to humans with the exception of the yew berries (which however contain a toxic seed); additionally, male and dioecious yews in this genus release cytotoxic pollen, which can cause headaches, lethargy, aching joints, itching, and skin rashes; it is also a trigger for asthma. These pollen granules are extremely small, and can easily pass through window screens. Male yews bloom and release abundant amounts of pollen in the spring; completely female yews only trap pollen while producing none.

Yews in this genus are primarily separate-sexed, and males are extremely allergenic, with an OPALS allergy scale rating of 10 out of 10. Completely female yews have an OPALS rating of 1, and are considered &quot;allergy-fighting&quot;.

== Uses and traditions ==
=== Bows ===
Yew wood is reddish brown (with whiter sapwood), and is very springy. It was traditionally used to make bows, especially the longbow. These longbows were used by Scythian people who were part of the police force in ancient Athens. This use was lent into the Ancient Greek word for &quot;bow&quot; and later probably borrowed into the Latin word and now generic name of &quot;Taxus&quot;.

Ötzi, the Chalcolithic mummy found in 1991 in the Italian Alps, carried an unfinished bow made of yew wood. Consequently, it is not surprising that in Norse mythology, the abode of the god of the bow, Ullr, had the name Ydalir (Yew Dales). Most longbow wood used in northern Europe was imported from Iberia, where climatic conditions are better for growing the knot-free yew wood required. The yew longbow was the critical weapon used by the English in the defeat of the French cavalry at the Battle of Agincourt, 1415. British yews tend to be too gnarly, and thus the wood for English longbows used at the Battle of Agincourt was imported from Spain or northern Italy.

===Cultivation===
It is suggested that English parishes were required to grow yews and, because of the trees&#x27; toxic properties, they were grown in the only commonly enclosed area of a village – the churchyard. The yew tree can often be found in church graveyards and is symbolic of sadness. Such a representation appears in Lord Alfred Tennyson&#x27;s poem &quot;In Memoriam A.H.H.&quot; (2.61–64).

The yew can be very long-lived. The Fortingall Yew has been considered to be the oldest tree in Europe, at something over 2,000 years old. Tradition has it that Pontius Pilate slept under it while on duty before 30 AD. Claims for an older tree have been made for the Defynnog Yew in the churchyard of St Cynog&#x27;s Church, Defynnog, Wales, but this view is contested. Such old trees usually consist of a circular ring of growths of yew, since their heart has long since rotted away.

The Eihwaz rune is named after the yew, and sometimes also associated with the &quot;evergreen&quot; world tree, Yggdrasil.

===Horticulture===

Yews are widely used in landscaping and ornamental horticulture. Over 400 cultivars of yews have been named, the vast majority of these being derived from European yew (&quot;Taxus baccata&quot;) or Japanese yew (&quot;Taxus cuspidata&quot;). The hybrid between these two species is &quot;Taxus&quot; × &quot;media&quot;. A popular fastigiate selection of the European yew (&quot;Taxus baccata&quot; &#x27;Fastigiata&#x27;) is often called the Irish yew, illustrating the difficulties with common names. A few cultivars with yellow leaves are collectively known as golden yews.

===Chemistry===
The Pacific yew (&quot;Taxus brevifolia&quot;), native to the Pacific Northwest of North America, and the Canada yew (&quot;Taxus canadensis&quot;) of Eastern and Central North America were the initial sources of paclitaxel or Taxol, a chemotherapeutic drug used in breast and lung cancer treatment and, more recently, in the production of the Taxus drug eluting stent by Boston Scientific. Over-harvesting of the Pacific yew for paclitaxel led to fears that it would become an endangered species, since the drug was initially extracted from the bark of the yew, the harvesting of which kills the tree. On January 18, 2008, the Botanic Gardens Conservation International (representing botanic gardens in 120 countries) stated that &quot;400 medicinal plants are at risk of extinction, from over-collection and deforestation, threatening the discovery of future cures for disease.&quot; These included yew trees, whose bark is used for the cancer drug paclitaxel.

However, methods were developed to produce the drug semi-synthetically from the leaves of cultivated European yews. Those can be sustainably harvested without the need to further endanger wild populations, and the Pacific yew is no longer at risk. The more common Canada yew is also being successfully harvested in northern Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick, and has become another major source of paclitaxel. Other yew species contain similar compounds with similar biochemical activity. Docetaxel, an analogue of paclitaxel, is derived from the European yew (&quot;Taxus baccata&quot;).
===In culture===
The yew tree is a frequent symbol in the Christian poetry of T. S. Eliot, especially his &quot;Four Quartets&quot;.

<text>The heaving line bend is a knot for securely joining two ropes of different diameter or rigidity. It is often used to affix playing strings to the thick silk eyes of an anchorage knot in some stringed instruments. In nautical use, the heaving line bend is used to connect a lighter messenger line to a hawser when mooring ships. It is knot number 1463 in &quot;The Ashley Book of Knots&quot;, and appeared in the 1916 Swedish knot manual &quot;Om Knutar&quot;.

The heaving line bend is similar to the sheet bend and the racking bend, and may be used to pass a thick rope to a distant receiver by first throwing the end of a thinner rope which may be weighted with a monkey fist or a heaving line knot.

==Tying steps==
The heaving line bend is tied the same way as the sheet bend with one difference: the final crossing of the thin end is done in the opposite direction, so the thin end points away from the thin line, essentially in the same direction as the thick end, towards the thick line. This avoids jamming when the thin line is pulled to carry the thick end out of reach.
#Make a bight in the larger line.
#Pass the lighter line around the standing part of the bight.
#Cross between the larger and the lighter line on the back side.
#Finish by tucking the end between its turn around the standing part of the bight and that leg; pull tight.

The other was the Soviet Air Defence Forces. The Air Forces were formed from components of the Imperial Russian Air Service in 1917, and faced their greatest test during World War II. The groups were also involved in the Korean War, and dissolved along with the Soviet Union itself in 1991–92. Former Soviet Air Forces&#x27; assets were subsequently divided into several air forces of former Soviet republics, including the new Russian Air Force. The &quot;March of the Pilots&quot; was its marching song.

==Origins==
The &quot;All-Russia Collegium for Direction of the Air Forces of the Old Army&quot; (translation is uncertain) was formed on 20 December 1917. This was a Bolshevik aerial headquarters initially led by Konstantin Akashev. Along with a general postwar military reorganisation, the collegium was reconstituted as the &quot;Workers&#x27; and Peasants&#x27; Red Air Fleet&quot; (&quot;Glavvozduhflot&quot;), established on 24 May 1918 and given the top-level departmental status of &quot;Main Directorate&quot;.

It became the Directorate of the USSR Air Forces on 28 March 1924, and then the Directorate of the Workers-Peasants Red Army Air Forces on 1 January 1925.

After the creation of the Soviet state many efforts were made in order to modernize and expand aircraft production, led by its charismatic and energetic commander, General Yakov Alksnis, an eventual victim of Joseph Stalin&#x27;s Great Purge. Domestic aircraft production increased significantly in the early 1930s and towards the end of the decade, the Soviet Air Force introduced Polikarpov I-15 and I-16 fighters and Tupolev SB and Ilyushin DB-3 bombers.

===Spanish civil war===

One of the first major tests for the VVS came in 1936 with the Spanish Civil War, in which the latest Soviet and German aircraft designs were employed against each other in fierce air-to-air combat. At first, the I-16 proved superior to any &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; fighters, and managed to achieve local air superiority wherever they were employed. However, the Soviets refused to supply the plane in adequate numbers, and their aerial victories were soon squandered because of their limited use. Later, Messerschmitt Bf 109s delivered to Franco&#x27;s Spanish Nationalist air forces secured air superiority for the Nationalists, one they would never relinquish.

On 19 November 1939, VVS headquarters was again titled the Main Directorate of the Red Army Air Forces under the WPRA HQ.

==1930s aviation and propaganda==
===Positive heroism===

The early 1930s saw a shift in ideological focus away from collectivist propaganda and towards &quot;positive heroism.&quot;
Instead of glorifying socialist collectivism as a means of societal advancement, the Soviet Communist Party began uplifting individuals who committed heroic actions that advanced the cause of socialism. In the case of aviation, the government began glorifying people who utilized aviation technology as opposed to glorifying the technology itself. Pilots such as Valery Chkalov, Georgy Baydukov, Alexander Belyakov, and Mikhail Gromov—as well as many others—were raised to the status of heroes for their piloting skills and achievements.

===Transpolar flights of 1937===

In May 1937, Stalin charged pilots Chkalov, Baydukov, and Belyakov with the mission to navigate the first transpolar flight in history. On 20 June 1937, the aviators landed their ANT-25 in Vancouver, Washington. A month later, Stalin ordered the departure of a second crew to push the boundaries of modern aviation technology even further. In July 1937 Mikhail Gromov, along with his crew Sergei Danilin and Andrei Yumashev, completed the same journey over the North Pole and continuing on to Southern California, creating a new record for the longest nonstop flight.

The public reaction to the transpolar flights was euphoric. The media called the pilots &quot;Bolshevik knights of culture and progress.&quot; Soviet citizens celebrated Aviation Day on 18 August with as much zeal as they celebrated the October Revolution anniversary. Literature including poems, short stories, and novels emerged celebrating the feats of the aviator-celebrities. Feature films like &quot;Victory&quot;, &quot;Tales of Heroic Aviators&quot;, and &quot;Valery Chkalov&quot; reinforced the &quot;positive hero&quot; imagery, celebrating the aviators&#x27; individuality within the context of a socialist government.

===Folkloric themes in aviation propaganda===

Soviet propaganda, newspaper articles, and other forms of media sought to connect Soviet citizens to relevant themes from daily life. For aviation, Stalin&#x27;s propagandists drew on Russian folklore. Following the successes of the transpolar flights by Chkalov and Gromov in 1937, examples increased dramatically. Aviators were referred to symbolically as &quot;sokoly&quot; (falcons), &quot;orly&quot; (eagles), or &quot;bogatyr&quot; (warriors). 

Newspapers told traditional Russian narratives (&quot;skazki&quot;) of fliers conquering time and space (&quot;prostranstvo&quot;), overcoming barriers and completing their missions in triumph. Even the story of each aviator suggests roots in old Russian storytelling and narratives—virtuous heroes striving to reach an end goal, encountering and conquering any obstacles in their path. By using folklore rhetoric, Stalin and Soviet propagandists connected aviation achievements to Russian heritage, making aviation seem more accessible to the Soviet population. Furthermore, the narratives emphasize the aviators&#x27; selflessness and devotion to a higher socialist ideal, pointing to Soviet leaders as inspirers and role models.

Soviet propagandists also exploited paternalism in aviation culture. The media presented Stalin as an example and inspiration, a father figure and role model to the most prominent Soviet pilots of the period. When recounting stories of meetings between Stalin and Chkalov, for example, Soviet newspapers spoke of Stalin&#x27;s paternalism towards the young pilot. The paternal metaphor was completed with the addition of a maternal figure—Russia, the motherland, who had produced &quot;father&quot; Stalin&#x27;s heroic sons such as Chkalov.

The use of familial metaphors not only evoked traditional hereditary pride and historic Russian patriotism, they boosted Stalin&#x27;s image as a benevolent leader. Most importantly, paternalism served to promote the message of individual subordination to authority. Through his paternal relationships with Soviet pilots, Stalin developed an &quot;ethos of deference and obedience&quot; for Soviet society to emulate.

===Aviation and the purges===

The successful achievements in Soviet aviation also came during the worst days of the Great Purge. The transpolar flights in summer 1937 occurred following the arrest and execution of a large body of the Red Army officer corps. Fifteen of sixteen total army commanders were executed; more than three-fourths of the VVS senior officers were arrested, executed, or relieved of duty. News coverage of the arrests was relatively little compared to treatment of aviation exploits, deflecting attention away from the arrests.

==Early combat==
Some practical combat experience had been gained in participating in the Spanish Civil War, and against Japan in the Far Eastern border conflicts. Shortly before the start of war with Germany a Soviet Volunteer Group was sent to China to train the pilots from the Republic of China Air Force for the continuing war with the Japanese. However, these experiences proved of little use in the Winter War against Finland in 1939, where scores of inexperienced Soviet bomber and fighter pilots were shot down by a relatively small number of Finnish Air Force pilots. The VVS soon learned established Soviet air defence procedures derived from the Spanish Civil War, such as forming defensive circles when attacked, did not work well against the Finns, who employed dive-and-zoom tactics to shoot down their Soviet opponents in great numbers.

On 1 January 1941, six months prior to Operation Barbarossa, the Air Forces of the Soviet Red Army had 363,900 serving personnel, accounting for 8.65% of all military force personnel of the Soviet Union. The first three Air Armies, designated Air Armies of Special Purpose, were created between 1936 and 1938. On 5 November 1940 these were reformed as the Long Range Bombardment Aviation of the High Command of the Red Army (until February 1942) due to lack of combat performance during the Winter War with Finland.

===Early World War II aviation failures===
1930s Soviet aviation also had a particular impact on the USSR&#x27;s military failures in the beginning of World War II. By 1938, the Soviet Union had the largest air force in the world, but Soviet aeronautical design distinctly lagged behind Western technological advances. Instead of focusing on developing tactical aircraft, the Soviets engineers developed heavy bomber planes only good for long distance—in other words, planes that would be used for record-breaking flights like those of Chkalov&#x27;s. The Soviet government&#x27;s focus on showy stunts and phenomenal record-breaking missions drained resources needed for Soviet defense. When Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union in June 1941, it quickly became apparent that the Soviet Air Force was not prepared for war. Poor planning and lack of organization left planes sitting at airbases, allowing the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; to destroy 4,000 Soviet planes within the first week.

==World War II==

At the outbreak of World War II, the Soviet Armed Forces was not yet ready or suitable for winning a war: Joseph Stalin had said in 1931 Soviet industry was &quot;50 to 100 years behind&quot; the Western powers. By the end of the war, Soviet annual aircraft production had risen sharply, reaching 40,241 in 1944. Some 157,261 machines were produced during the war, 125,655 being of combat types.

On the outbreak of war the Red Army Air Force consisted of the Long-Range Bomber Aviation (Дальнебомбардировочная авиация); &quot;Frontal&quot; Aviation, serving the various land forces fronts; Army Aviation; and Force Aviation, all subordinate to the State Defence Committee&#x27;s Main Directorate of the Air Force of the Red Army. By mid-1943 Frontal Aviation absorbed Army and Force Aviation.

One of the main reasons for the large aircraft losses in the initial period of war with Germany was not the lack of modern tactics, but the lack of experienced pilots and ground support crews, the destruction of many aircraft on the runways due to command failure to disperse them, and the rapid advance of &quot;Heer&quot; troops, forcing the Soviet pilots on the defensive during Operation Barbarossa, while being confronted with more modern German designs. In the first few days of the invasion of the Soviet Union, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; destroyed some 2,000 Soviet aircraft, most on the ground, at a loss of only 35 (of which 15 were non-combat-related).

The principal &quot;VVS&quot; aircraft during World War II were the Ilyushin Il-2 &quot;Shturmovik&quot; armored ground attack monoplane and the series of AS Yakovlev OKB-115 designed single-engined fighters, beginning with the Yak-1 and its successors. The Il-2 became (at 36,183 built) the most produced military aircraft of all time, with the four main versions of Yak fighters (the Yak-1, −3, −7 and −9) being slightly more numerous, at a total of 36,716 among them. These two main types together accounted for about half the strength of the VVS for most of the war. The Yak-1 was a modern 1940 design and had room for development, unlike the mature 1935-origin Messerschmitt Bf 109. The Yak-9 brought the &quot;VVS&quot; to parity with the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; and eventually allowed it to gain the upper hand, until in 1944, many &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; pilots deliberately avoided combat with the last and best variant, the out-of-sequence numbered Yak-3. The other main &quot;VVS&quot; types were Lavochkin fighters (mainly the La-5), the Petlyakov Pe-2 twin engined attack-bombers, and a basic but functional and versatile medium bomber, the Ilyushin Il-4.

The 31st Bomber Aviation Regiment, equipped with Pe-2s, was one of the first Guards bomber units in the Air Forces – the 4th Guards Bomber Aviation Regiment. The title was conferred on the regiment for its actions on the Leningrad Front in November–December 1941 during defensive operations and the Soviet counterattack near Tikhvin.

===Women===
Alone among World War II combatants, the Soviet Air Force initiated a program to bring women with existing flying training into combat air groups. Marina Raskova, one of very few women in the &quot;VVS&quot; prior to the war, used her influence with Stalin to form three all-female air regiments: the 586th Fighter Aviation Regiment, the 587th Bomber Aviation Regiment, and the 588th Night Bomber Aviation Regiment (a.k.a. the &quot;Night Witches&quot;.) Women flew aircraft so heavy that sometimes two of them were required to haul back on the joystick on takeoff.

The latter two air force units were honored by being renamed Guards units. Beyond the three official regiments, individual Soviet women sometimes served alongside airmen in otherwise all-male groups. Women pilots, navigators, gunners, mechanics, armament specialists and other female ground personnel made up more than 3,000 members of the &quot;VVS&quot;. Women pilots flew 24,000 sorties.

===Innovation and Lend-lease===
While there were scores of Red Army divisions on the ground formed from specific Soviet republics, there appears to have been very few aviation regiments formed from nationalities, among them being the 1st Latvian Night Aviation Regiment.

Chief Marshal of Aviation Alexander Novikov led the VVS from 1942 to the end of the war, and was credited with introducing several innovations and weapons systems. For the last year of the war German military and civilians retreating towards Berlin were hounded by the presence of &quot;low flying aircraft&quot; strafing and bombing them, an activity in which even the ancient Polikarpov Po-2, a much produced flight training &quot;(uchebnyy)&quot; biplane of 1920s design, took part. However, this was but a small measure of the experience the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; were receiving due to the sophistication and superiority of the Red Air Force. In one strategic operation alone, the Yassy-Kishinev Strategic Offensive, the 5th and 17th Air Armys and the Black Sea Fleet Naval Aviation aircraft achieved a 3.3 to 1 superiority in aircraft over Luftflotte 4 and the Royal Romanian Air Force, allowing almost complete freedom from air harassment for the ground troops of the 2nd and 3rd Ukrainian Fronts.

As with many Allied countries in World War II, the Soviet Union received Western aircraft through Lend-Lease and the Anglo-Soviet Agreement, mostly Bell P-39 Airacobras, Bell P-63 Kingcobras, Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawks, Douglas A-20 Havocs, Hawker Hurricanes, and North American B-25 Mitchells. Some of these aircraft arrived in the Soviet Union in time to participate in the Battle of Moscow, and in particular with the PVO or Soviet Air Defence Forces. Soviet fliers in P-39s scored the highest individual kill totals of any ever to fly a U.S. aircraft. Two air regiments were equipped with Supermarine Spitfire Mk.Vbs in early 1943 but immediately experienced unrelenting losses due to friendly fire as the British aircraft looked too much like the German Bf 109. The Soviet Union was then supplied with some 1,200 Spitfire Mk. IXs from 1943. Soviet pilots liked them but they did not suit Soviet combat tactics and the rough conditions at the forward airfields close to the front lines. Spitfires Mk. IXs were therefore assigned to air defense units, using the high altitude performance to intercept and pursue German bombers and reconnaissance aircraft. By 1944, the Spitfire IX was the main fighter used in this role and would remain so until 1947. Lend-Lease aircraft from the U.S. and UK accounted for nearly 12% of total Soviet air power.

The greatest Soviet fighter ace of World War II was Ivan Nikitovich Kozhedub, who scored 62 victories from 6 July 1943 to 16 April 1945, the top score for any Allied fighter pilot of World War II.

==Cold War==

In 1945–46, the WPKA Army Air Forces became the Soviet Air Forces once again. Its capabilities increased, helped by Western transfer of technology: the downed Boeing B-29 Superfortresses in the Far East, and British transfer of Rolls-Royce Nene jet engines. The force became one of the best services of the Soviet Armed Forces due to the various types of aircraft being flown and their capabilities and the strength and training of its pilots. Its air defence arm became an independent component of the armed forces in 1949, reaching full-fledged force status in 1954 as the Soviet Air Defence Force.

During the Cold War, the Soviet Air Force was rearmed, strengthened and modern air doctrines were introduced. At its peak in 1980, it could deploy approximately 10,000 aircraft, making it the world&#x27;s largest air force of the time.

The Soviet Air Force covertly participated in the Korean War. Twelve fighter divisions of 26,000 pilots participated in air-to-air combat with the U.S. and other Allied air forces, inflicting significant casualties. The 64th Fighter Aviation Corps supervised the Soviet interceptor forces. In order to keep their involvement a secret, Joseph Stalin ordered the Soviet Air Force MiG-15s participating in the conflict to fly with the Korean People&#x27;s Air Force and PLA Air Force markings, wear Chinese uniforms, and speak only Chinese phrases over radio in the air.

In 1977 the VVS and the Soviet Air Defence Forces were re-organised in the Baltic states and the Leningrad Oblast, as a trial run for the larger re-organisation in 1980 covering the whole country. All fighter units in the PVO were transferred to the VVS, the Air Defence Forces only retaining the anti-aircraft missile units and radar units. The 6th Independent Air Defence Army was disbanded, and the 15th Air Army became the Air Forces of the Baltic Military District. The experiment was then applied countrywide in 1980. Two of the three aviation schools in the Troops of National Air Defence were transferred to the Air Force.

Western analysts found that Soviet non-Slavs, including Jews, Armenians, and Asians were generally barred from senior ranks and from joining elite or strategic positions in the Air Force, Strategic Rocket Forces, and the Soviet Navy because of doubts regarding the loyalty of ethnic minorities. RAND analyst S. Enders Wimbush said, &quot;Soldiers are clearly recruited in a way that reflects the worries of society. The average Russian citizen and Soviet decision maker have questions about the allegiance of the non-Slav, especially the Central Asian.&quot; Odom, writing eight years after the collapse of the USSR, noted that 97% of the officer corps was Russian, Ukrainian or Belarusian.

During the Cold War the VVS was divided into three main branches: Long Range Aviation (DA), with long-range bombers; Frontal Aviation (&quot;Frontovaya Aviatsiya&quot; – FA), focused on battlefield air defence, close air support, and interdiction; and Military Transport Aviation (&quot;Voenno-Transportnaya Aviatsiya&quot; – VTA), which controlled all transport aircraft. The Soviet Air Defence Force, which operated interceptor aircraft and surface to air missiles, was then a separate and distinct service within the Soviet military organisation. Yet another independent service was the Soviet Navy&#x27;s air arm, the Soviet Naval Aviation under the Navy Headquarters.

The official day of VVS was the Soviet Air Fleet Day, that often featured notable air shows meant to display Soviet air power advancements through the years, held in Moscow&#x27;s Tushino airfield.

===Breakup of the Soviet Union===
Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991 the aircraft and personnel of the Soviet VVS were divided among the newly independent states. Russia received the plurality of these forces, approximately 40% of the aircraft and 65% of the manpower, with these forming the basis for the new Russian Air Force.

===Forces in the late 1980s===

The Soviet Air Force&#x27;s aviation assets were organised into four types of forces (sing. &quot;вид авиации&quot;) - Long Range Aviation, Frontal Aviation, Military Transport Aviation and Army Aviation (which would transfer to the Ground Forces in case of war). Pilot training establishments were integrated into the Air Armies of the Frontal Aviation.
==== Higher command echelons of the Air Forces ====

In addition, the 34th Mixed Aviation Corps (:ru:34-й смешанный авиационный корпус), later re-designated to the Air Forces of the 40th Army, supported the 40th Army in Afghanistan during the Soviet–Afghan War. Its HQ was in Kabul, Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, co-located with the HQ of the 40th Army itself.

==== Directly subordinated to the AF Main Staff ====
Several formations and flying units were directly subordinated to the Air Forces Main Staff (&quot;Главный штаб ВВС&quot;). They provided air transport for high-ranking government and military officials, flight testing or support to other research and development fields.

Units directly subordinated to the Main Staff:

* 21st Aviation Squadron of Flying Laboratories - Kubinka - An-12, An-26, Mi-8
* 27th Helicopter Squadron - Semipalatinsk, Kazakh SSR - Mi-8 (provided liaison flight support to the Semipalatinsk Test Site, a nuclear test site)
* 101st Test [Support] Aviation Squadron (287th according to some sources) - Nukus, Uzbek SSR - An-26, Mi-8 (provided support to the 8th Chemical Defence Station test range on the Ustyurt Plateau)
* 220th Test [Support] Aviation Squadron of Specific Purpose - Aralsk, Kazakh SSR - An-72, An-26, Mi-26, Mi-8, An-2 (provided airborne telemetric surveillance support to the Kapustin Yar missile test range. The airfield also provided liaison flights to the top-secret &quot;Barkhan&quot; bacteriological warfare test range on Vozrozhdeniya Island)
* unidentified Aviation Squadron - Klin - Tu-134, An-12, An-26, An-24, Mi-8 (Klin air base was also considered the &#x27;household&#x27; airfield of the Air Defence Forces aviation and a mixed air regiment was based there with the mission to provide liaison flights to the Air Defence Forces Main Staff and flight skills refreshment for the high ranking pilot officers)
* Transport Aviation Squadron - Privolzhskiy (near Astrakhan) - Il-18, An-26, Mi-8 (provided liaison flights to the 116th Combat Application Training Center of the Air Defence Aviation
* 2nd State Central Test Range (designation in some sources given as the) - Semipalatinsk
** Transport Aviation Squadron - ZATO Kurchatov-21 (also listed sometimes as the Semipalatinsk-21) - An-30RR, An-24RR, Mi-8/9 (RR - Radiation Reconnaissance)
** Transport Aviation Squadron - Semipalatinsk (Zhanasemei airfield) - An-30, An-24RR

** Composite Aviation Squadron - Chkalovsky - Il-80 (4 aircraft), Il-76RT (2 aircraft) (attached to the 8th ADSP for air traffic control, ground support and maintenance, but reporting directly to the Ministry of Defence. The Il-80 was the airborne command center variant of the Il-86 and the Soviet counterpart to the E-4. The four Il-80 received command task force of officers detailed from the Ministry of Defence when on airborne duty. The two Il-76RT were relay aircraft (RT - &#x27;retranslator&#x27;) and had no command task force on board. They provided Ultra high frequency link between the Soviet nuclear triad and the command centers and were equipped with drag antennae array, which could extend to a total length of 6 kilometers. The Navy&#x27;s SSBNs and the Air Force&#x27;s Long Range Aviation normally used alternative communications channels, so the main task for the Il-76RTs remained to provide a link to the Strategic Rocket Forces. The command and control system was designated &quot;Chain Link&quot; (&quot;Звено&quot;) and included the Il-80s, the Il-76RTs, the underground silo-based &quot;&#x27;Perimetr&#x27;&quot; and the railway-based &quot;&#x27;Gorn&quot;&#x27; command alert missiles.)

<text>R v Park [1995] 2 S.C.R. 836, is a Supreme Court of Canada case dealing with the mistaken belief defence – i.e. that the accused had an honest but mistaken belief that he had consent to engage in sexual relations with the complainant – and the role of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in relation to sexual assault.

== Facts ==
The accused was charged with sexual assault. Two weeks before the incident, the complainant and the accused had dated for the first time. Park testified that at her apartment they became intimate; fondled one another&#x27;s private parts and talked of sex and birth control; she masturbated him to ejaculation. She maintains that they only kissed and talked of birth control. She stated she was a born again Christian and did not believe in premarital sex and thus claimed there was no consensual sexual activity.

On the day of the incident, the accused called the complainant early in the morning; she agreed that he could come over. He arrived shortly thereafter and she greeted him at the door with a kiss on the cheek, wearing only her bathrobe. She claimed that, a few minutes later, he drew her to him and pushed her onto the bed. He was strong and while she resisted actively he could not be stopped. At that point, feeling his weight on her, she flashbacked to a previous traumatic experience. She went into &quot;shock&quot;. His pulling his penis out of her and ejaculating on her stomach was the next thing she remembered. The accused had a very different story. He testified that she actively participated and when things got &quot;hot&quot;, he prematurely ejaculated on her stomach. He denied that intercourse took place. 

A medical report from the examination of the complainant indicated redness on the inner labia, consistent with consensual or non-consensual intercourse.

At trial, the accused&#x27;s defence was that either (1) that she consented to the sexual activity or, (2) alternatively, that he had an honest but mistaken belief that she was consenting. The trial judge refused to put the mistaken belief defence to the jury, finding there was no &quot;air of reality&quot; to it, and concluding that the issue was simply one of &quot;consent or no consent&quot;. 

The accused was convicted. On appeal, the majority of the Court of Appeal set aside the conviction ordering a new trial, and that the trial judge erred by not putting the mistaken-belief defence to the jury.

;Held : The conviction restored.

==Reasoning ==
This case discusses the defence of mistaken belief and how there must be an air of reality to that defence, i.e. the accused cannot put forth the defence if there is no air of reality in relation to the evidence in the case. In this particular situation there was little if no evidence that might have substantiated his allegation that he might have had an honest belief that she was giving consent, i.e. she was a born again Christian, she did not believe in premarital sex, the objective evidence of redness on the inner labia, consistent with consensual or non-consensual intercourse.

The opinion of &quot;L&#x27;Heureux-Dubé&quot; J. stresses that there is an issue of treating women and men equally in these types of cases regarding the equality rights that afforded to all by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (at page 864):

<doc id="229937" wikidata="Q542511" url="?curid=229937" title="Hoechst AG">
<text>Hoechst AG () was a German chemicals, later life sciences, company that became Aventis Deutschland after its merger with France&#x27;s Rhône-Poulenc S.A. in 1999. With the new company&#x27;s 2004 merger with Sanofi-Synthélabo, it became a subsidiary of the resulting Sanofi-Aventis pharmaceuticals group.

==History==
The company was founded in 1863 as &quot;Teerfarbenfabrik Meister, Lucius &amp; Co.&quot; in Höchst, near Frankfurt and changed its name some years later to &quot;Teerfarbenfabrik Meister Lucius &amp; Brüning&quot;. In 1880, it became a stock company &quot;Farbwerke vorm. Meister Lucius &amp; Brüning AG&quot;. For the international market the name was simplified to &quot;Farbwerke Hoechst AG&quot;. Until 1925, the Hoechst AG was independent. In 1916, the Hoechst AG was one of the co-founders of IG Farben, an advocacy group of Germany&#x27;s chemicals industry to gain industrial power during and after World War I. In 1925, IG Farben turned from an advocacy group into the well-known conglomerate.

== World War II ==
Various Hoechst facilities were bombed during the Oil Campaign of World War II. Its managers in charge were prosecuted along with other IG Farben managers — during the Nuremberg trials — in the IG Farben trial for their role in the exploitation of enslaved laborers and for testing drugs on concentration camp prisoners.

== Postwar timeline ==
1951 — Hoechst AG was re-founded on December 7 in Frankfurt when IG Farben was split into its founder companies. The original capitalization of the company was 100,000 Deutsche Mark. By 1953, Hoechst had acquired parts of Knapsack-Griesheim, , Behring Werke, Wacker Chemie and Ruhr Chemie, among others.

1957 — Signed a technical cooperation contract with Handok Pharmaceuticals In South Korea

1964 — Handok Pharmaceuticals Joint Venture Partner In South Korea

1969 — Hoechst acquired Cassella.

1970 — Hoechst AG took over Berger, Jenson and Nicholson Ltd.

1974 - Hoechst acquired Foster Grant

1986 - Hoechst sold Foster Grant to Andlinger &amp; Co.

1987 — Hoechst acquired the American chemical company Celanese and formed a new Hoechst subsidiary in the US, Hoechst Celanese.

1988 — Hoechst AG sold Berger, Jenson and Nicholson Ltd to Williams Holdings.

1995 — Hoechst merges with Marion Merrell Dow of Kansas City, Missouri forming U.S. subsidiary Hoechst Marion Roussel (HMR).

1997 — Hoechst underwent a realignment wherein its various businesses were transferred to independent companies, including Nutrinova and Clariant.

1999 (December 7) — Hoechst and Rhône-Poulenc settle Federal Trade Commission charges that merger would violate U.S. antitrust laws;

1999 — Aventis was formed when Hoechst AG merged with Rhône-Poulenc S.A. The merged company was headquartered in Strasbourg, Eastern France. As part of the merger, the company demerged many of its industrial businesses into Celanese, which became an independent company again (e.g. the engineering polymers business Ticona).

2005 — The company became a wholly owned subsidiary of Sanofi-Aventis (now called Sanofi).

==Key figures ==
Wilhelm Meister (1827–1895) founded the chemical company Teerfarbenfabrik Meister, Lucius &amp; Co. which eventually became Hoechst AG. He was the great-grandfather of William von Meister, one of the founders of Control Video Corporation which later became America Online. Pascal Soriot (the now-chief executive of AstraZeneca) held positions with the organisation from 1989 up until 2006, through Aventis.

<text>Fractional calculus is a branch of mathematical analysis that studies the several different possibilities of defining real number powers or complex number powers of the differentiation operator formula_1 
formula_2

and of the integration operator formula_3 
formula_4

and developing a calculus for such operators generalizing the classical one.

In this context, the term &quot;powers&quot; refers to iterative application of a linear operator formula_1 to a function that is, repeatedly composing formula_1 with itself, as in
formula_7

For example, one may ask for a meaningful interpretation of
formula_8

as an analogue of the functional square root for the differentiation operator, that is, an expression for some linear operator that, when applied to any function, will have the same effect as differentiation. More generally, one can look at the question of defining a linear operator
formula_9

for every real number formula_10 in such a way that, when formula_10 takes an integer value it coincides with the usual differentiation formula_1 if and with the power of formula_3 when 

One of the motivations behind the introduction and study of these sorts of extensions of the differentiation operator formula_1 is that the sets of operator powers formula_15 defined in this way are &quot;continuous&quot; semigroups with parameter of which the original &quot;discrete&quot; semigroup of formula_16 for integer formula_17 is a denumerable subgroup: since continuous semigroups have a well developed mathematical theory, they can be applied to other branches of mathematics.

Fractional differential equations, also known as extraordinary differential equations, are a generalization of differential equations through the application of fractional calculus.

== Historical notes ==
In applied mathematics and mathematical analysis, a fractional derivative is a derivative of any arbitrary order, real or complex. Its first appearance is in a letter written to Guillaume de l&#x27;Hôpital by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in 1695.  Around the same time, Leibniz wrote to one of the Bernoulli brothers describing the similarity between the binomial theorem and the Leibniz rule for the fractional derivative of a product of two functions. 

Fractional calculus was introduced in one of Niels Henrik Abel&#x27;s early papers where all the elements can be found: the idea of fractional-order integration and differentiation, the mutually inverse relationship between them, the understanding that fractional-order differentiation and integration can be considered as the same generalized operation, and the unified notation for differentiation and integration of arbitrary real order.
Independently, the foundations of the subject were laid by Liouville in a paper from 1832. Oliver Heaviside introduced the practical use of fractional differential operators in electrical transmission line analysis circa 1890. The theory and applications of fractional calculus expanded greatly over the 19th and 20th centuries, and numerous contributors have given different definitions for fractional derivatives and integrals.

==Computing the fractional integral==
Let be a function defined for . Form the definite integral from 0 to . Call this
formula_18

Repeating this process gives
formula_19

and this can be extended arbitrarily.

The Cauchy formula for repeated integration, namely
formula_20
leads in a straightforward way to a generalization for real : using the gamma function to remove the discrete nature of the factorial function gives us a natural candidate for applications of the fractional integral operator as
formula_21

This is in fact a well-defined operator.

It is straightforward to show that the operator satisfies
formula_22
formula_23

where in the last step we exchanged the order of integration and pulled out the factor from the integration.

Changing variables to defined by ,
formula_24

The inner integral is the beta function which satisfies the following property:
formula_25

Substituting back into the equation:
formula_26

Interchanging and shows that the order in which the operator is applied is irrelevant and completes the proof.
This relationship is called the semigroup property of fractional differintegral operators. 

===Riemann–Liouville fractional integral===
The classical form of fractional calculus is given by the Riemann–Liouville integral, which is essentially what has been described above. The theory of fractional integration for periodic functions (therefore including the &quot;boundary condition&quot; of repeating after a period) is given by the Weyl integral. It is defined on Fourier series, and requires the constant Fourier coefficient to vanish (thus, it applies to functions on the unit circle whose integrals evaluate to zero). The Riemann–Liouville integral exists in two forms, upper and lower. Considering the interval , the integrals are defined as
formula_27

Where the former is valid for and the latter is valid for . 

It has been suggested that the integral on the positive real axis (i.e. formula_28) would be more appropriately named the Abel–Riemann integral, on the basis of history of discovery and use, and in the same vein the integral over the entire real line be named Liouville–Weyl integral.

By contrast the Grünwald–Letnikov derivative starts with the derivative instead of the integral.

===Hadamard fractional integral===
The &quot;Hadamard fractional integral&quot; was introduced by Jacques Hadamard and is given by the following formula,
formula_29

===Atangana–Baleanu fractional integral (AB fractional integral)===
The Atangana–Baleanu fractional integral of a continuous function is defined as:
formula_30

==Fractional derivatives==
Unfortunately, the comparable process for the derivative operator is significantly more complex, but it can be shown that is neither commutative nor additive in general.

Unlike classical Newtonian derivatives, fractional derivatives can be defined in a variety of different ways that often do not all lead to the same result even for smooth functions. Some of these are defined via a fractional integral. Because of the incompatibility of definitions, it is frequently necessary to be explicit about which definition is used.
===Riemann–Liouville fractional derivative===
The corresponding derivative is calculated using Lagrange&#x27;s rule for differential operators. To find the th order derivative, the th order derivative of the integral of order is computed, where is the smallest integer greater than (that is, ). The Riemann–Liouville fractional derivative and integral has multiple applications such as in case of solutions to the equation in the case of multiple systems such as the tokamak systems, and Variable order fractional parameter. Similar to the definitions for the Riemann–Liouville integral, the derivative has upper and lower variants.
formula_31

===Caputo fractional derivative===

Another option for computing fractional derivatives is the Caputo fractional derivative. It was introduced by Michele Caputo in his 1967 paper. In contrast to the Riemann–Liouville fractional derivative, when solving differential equations using Caputo&#x27;s definition, it is not necessary to define the fractional order initial conditions. Caputo&#x27;s definition is illustrated as follows, where again :
formula_32

There is the Caputo fractional derivative defined as:
formula_33
which has the advantage that it is zero when is constant and its Laplace Transform is expressed by means of the initial values of the function and its derivative. Moreover, there is the Caputo fractional derivative of distributed order defined as
formula_34

where is a weight function and which is used to represent mathematically the presence of multiple memory formalisms.

===Caputo–Fabrizio fractional derivative===
In a paper of 2015, M. Caputo and M. Fabrizio presented a definition of fractional derivative with a non singular kernel, for a function formula_35 of formula_36 given by:
formula_37

where 

===Atangana–Baleanu fractional derivative===
In 2016, Atangana and Baleanu suggested differential operators based on the generalized Mittag-Leffler function formula_38. The aim was to introduce fractional differential operators with non-singular nonlocal kernel. Their fractional differential operators are given below in Riemann–Liouville sense and Caputo sense respectively. For a function formula_35 of formula_36 given by 
formula_41

If the function is continuous, the Atangana–Baleanu derivative in Riemann–Liouville sense is given by:
formula_42

The kernel used in Atangana–Baleanu fractional derivative has some properties of a cumulative distribution function.  For example, for all the function formula_43 is increasing on the real line, converges to formula_44 in and Therefore, we have that, the function formula_45 is the cumulative distribution function of a probability measure on the positive real numbers. The distribution is therefore defined, and any of its multiples is called a Mittag-Leffler distribution of order It is also very well-known that, all these probability distributions are absolutely continuous. In particular, the function Mittag-Leffler has a particular case which is the exponential function, the Mittag-Leffler distribution of order formula_46 is therefore an exponential distribution. However, for the Mittag-Leffler distributions are heavy-tailed. Their Laplace transform is given by:
formula_47

This directly implies that, for the expectation is infinite. In addition, these distributions are geometric stable distributions.

===Riesz derivative===
The Riesz derivative is defined as
formula_48

where formula_49 denotes the Fourier transform.

=== Conformable fractional derivative ===
The conformable fractional derivative of a function formula_50 of order formula_51 is given byformula_52Unlike other definitions of the fractional derivative, the conformable fractional derivative obeys the product and quotient rule has analogs to Rolle&#x27;s theorem and the mean value theorem. However, this fractional derivative produces significantly different results compared to the Riemann-Liouville and Caputo fractional derivative. In 2020, Feng Gao and Chunmei Chi defined the improved Caputo-type conformable fractional derivative, which more closely approximates the behavior of the Caputo fractional derivative:formula_53where formula_10 and formula_55 are real numbers and formula_56.They also defined the improved Riemann-Liouville-type conformable fractional derivative to similarly approximate the Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative:

formula_57where formula_10 and formula_55 are real numbers and formula_56. Both improved conformable fractional derivatives have analogs to Rolle&#x27;s theorem and the interior extremum theorem.

=== Other types ===
Classical fractional derivatives include:
* Grünwald–Letnikov derivative
* Sonin–Letnikov derivative
* Liouville derivative
* Caputo derivative
* Hadamard derivative
* Marchaud derivative
* Riesz derivative
* Miller–Ross derivative
* Weyl derivative
* Erdélyi–Kober derivative
* formula_61-derivative
New fractional derivatives include:
* Coimbra derivative
* Katugampola derivative
* Hilfer derivative
* Davidson derivative
* Chen derivative
* Caputo Fabrizio derivative
* Atangana–Baleanu derivative

====Coimbra derivative====
The Coimbra derivative is used for physical modeling: A number of applications in both mechanics and optics can be found in the works by Coimbra and collaborators, as well as additional applications to physical problems and numerical implementations studied in a number of works by other authors

 For formula_62
 formula_63
where the lower limit formula_10 can be taken as either formula_65 or formula_66 as long as formula_35 is identically zero from or formula_66 to formula_65. Note that this operator returns the correct fractional derivatives for all values of formula_55 and can be applied to either the dependent function itself formula_71 with a variable order of the form formula_72 or to the independent variable with a variable order of the form formula_73.formula_74 

The Coimbra derivative can be generalized to any order, leading to the Coimbra Generalized Order Differintegration Operator (GODO)
 For formula_75
 formula_76
where formula_77 is an integer larger than the larger value of formula_73 for all values of formula_55. Note that the second (summation) term on the right side of the definition above can be expressed as 

 formula_80
so to keep the denominator on the positive branch of the Gamma (formula_81) function and for ease of numerical calculation.

=== Nature of the fractional derivative ===
The derivative of a function formula_50 at a point formula_83 is a &quot;local property&quot; only when formula_10 is an integer; this is not the case for non-integer power derivatives. In other words, a non-integer fractional derivative of formula_50 at formula_86 depends on all values of even those far away from Therefore, it is expected that the fractional derivative operation involves some sort of boundary conditions, involving information on the function further out.

The fractional derivative of a function of order formula_10 is nowadays often defined by means of the Fourier or Mellin integral transforms.

==Generalizations==

===Erdélyi–Kober operator===
The Erdélyi–Kober operator is an integral operator introduced by Arthur Erdélyi (1940). and Hermann Kober (1940) and is given by
formula_88

which generalizes the Riemann–Liouville fractional integral and the Weyl integral.

==Functional calculus==
In the context of functional analysis, functions more general than powers are studied in the functional calculus of spectral theory. The theory of pseudo-differential operators also allows one to consider powers of . The operators arising are examples of singular integral operators; and the generalisation of the classical theory to higher dimensions is called the theory of Riesz potentials. So there are a number of contemporary theories available, within which &quot;fractional calculus&quot; can be discussed. See also Erdélyi–Kober operator, important in special function theory , .

==Applications==

===Fractional conservation of mass===
As described by Wheatcraft and Meerschaert (2008), a fractional conservation of mass equation is needed to model fluid flow when the control volume is not large enough compared to the scale of heterogeneity and when the flux within the control volume is non-linear. In the referenced paper, the fractional conservation of mass equation for fluid flow is:
formula_89

===Electrochemical analysis===

When studying the redox behavior of a substrate in solution, a voltage is applied at an electrode surface to force electron transfer between electrode and substrate. The resulting electron transfer is measured as a current. The current depends upon the concentration of substrate at the electrode surface. As substrate is consumed, fresh substrate diffuses to the electrode as described by Fick&#x27;s laws of diffusion. Taking the Laplace transform of Fick&#x27;s second law yields an ordinary second-order differential equation (here in dimensionless form):
formula_90

whose solution contains a one-half power dependence on . Taking the derivative of and then the inverse Laplace transform yields the following relationship:
formula_91

which relates the concentration of substrate at the electrode surface to the current. This relationship is applied in electrochemical kinetics to elucidate mechanistic behavior. For example, it has been used to study the rate of dimerization of substrates upon electrochemical reduction.

===Groundwater flow problem===
In 2013–2014 Atangana et al. described some groundwater flow problems using the concept of a derivative with fractional order. In these works, the classical Darcy law is generalized by regarding the water flow as a function of a non-integer order derivative of the piezometric head. This generalized law and the law of conservation of mass are then used to derive a new equation for groundwater flow.

===Fractional advection dispersion equation===
This equation has been shown useful for modeling contaminant flow in heterogenous porous media.

Atangana and Kilicman extended the fractional advection dispersion equation to a variable order equation. In their work, the hydrodynamic dispersion equation was generalized using the concept of a variational order derivative. The modified equation was numerically solved via the Crank–Nicolson method. The stability and convergence in numerical simulations showed that the modified equation is more reliable in predicting the movement of pollution in deformable aquifers than equations with constant fractional and integer derivatives

===Time-space fractional diffusion equation models===
Anomalous diffusion processes in complex media can be well characterized by using fractional-order diffusion equation models. The time derivative term corresponds to long-time heavy tail decay and the spatial derivative for diffusion nonlocality. The time-space fractional diffusion governing equation can be written as
formula_92

A simple extension of the fractional derivative is the variable-order fractional derivative, and are changed into and . Its applications in anomalous diffusion modeling can be found in the reference.

===Structural damping models===
Fractional derivatives are used to model viscoelastic damping in certain types of materials like polymers.

===PID controllers===
Generalizing PID controllers to use fractional orders can increase their degree of freedom. The new equation relating the &quot;control variable&quot; in terms of a measured &quot;error value&quot; can be written as
formula_93

where and are positive fractional orders and , , and , all non-negative, denote the coefficients for the proportional, integral, and derivative terms, respectively (sometimes denoted , , and ).

===Acoustic wave equations for complex media===
The propagation of acoustical waves in complex media, such as in biological tissue, commonly implies attenuation obeying a frequency power-law. This kind of phenomenon may be described using a causal wave equation which incorporates fractional time derivatives:
formula_94

See also Holm &amp; Näsholm (2011) and the references therein. Such models are linked to the commonly recognized hypothesis that multiple relaxation phenomena give rise to the attenuation measured in complex media. This link is further described in Näsholm &amp; Holm (2011b) and in the survey paper, as well as the &quot;Acoustic attenuation&quot; article. See Holm &amp; Nasholm (2013) for a paper which compares fractional wave equations which model power-law attenuation. This book on power-law attenuation also covers the topic in more detail.

Pandey and Holm gave a physical meaning to fractional differential equations by deriving them from physical principles and interpreting the fractional-order in terms of the parameters of the acoustical media, example in fluid-saturated granular unconsolidated marine sediments. Interestingly, Pandey and Holm derived Lomnitz&#x27;s law in seismology and Nutting&#x27;s law in non-Newtonian rheology using the framework of fractional calculus. Nutting&#x27;s law was used to model the wave propagation in marine sediments using fractional derivatives.

===Fractional Schrödinger equation in quantum theory===
The fractional Schrödinger equation, a fundamental equation of fractional quantum mechanics, has the following form:
formula_95

where the solution of the equation is the wavefunction – the quantum mechanical probability amplitude for the particle to have a given position vector at any given time , and is the reduced Planck constant. The potential energy function depends on the system.

Further, formula_96 is the Laplace operator, and is a scale constant with physical dimension , (at , formula_97 for a particle of mass ), and the operator is the 3-dimensional fractional quantum Riesz derivative defined by
formula_98

The index in the fractional Schrödinger equation is the Lévy index, .

====Variable-order fractional Schrödinger equation====
As a natural generalization of the fractional Schrödinger equation, the variable-order fractional Schrödinger equation has been exploited to study fractional quantum phenomena:
formula_99

where formula_96 is the Laplace operator and the operator is the variable-order fractional quantum Riesz derivative.

<text>In mathematics, a multiplicative inverse or reciprocal for a number &quot;x&quot;, denoted by 1/&quot;x&quot; or &quot;x&quot;−1, is a number which when multiplied by &quot;x&quot; yields the multiplicative identity, 1. The multiplicative inverse of a fraction &quot;a&quot;/&quot;b&quot; is &quot;b&quot;/&quot;a&quot;. For the multiplicative inverse of a real number, divide 1 by the number. For example, the reciprocal of 5 is one fifth (1/5 or 0.2), and the reciprocal of 0.25 is 1 divided by 0.25, or 4. The reciprocal function, the function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) that maps &quot;x&quot; to 1/&quot;x&quot;, is one of the simplest examples of a function which is its own inverse (an involution).

Multiplying by a number is the same as dividing by its reciprocal and vice versa. For example, multiplication by 4/5 (or 0.8) will give the same result as division by 5/4 (or 1.25). Therefore, multiplication by a number followed by multiplication by its reciprocal yields the original number (since the product of the number and its reciprocal is 1).

The term &quot;reciprocal&quot; was in common use at least as far back as the third edition of &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; (1797) to describe two numbers whose product is 1; geometrical quantities in inverse proportion are described as in a 1570 translation of Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;.

In the phrase &quot;multiplicative inverse&quot;, the qualifier &quot;multiplicative&quot; is often omitted and then tacitly understood (in contrast to the additive inverse). Multiplicative inverses can be defined over many mathematical domains as well as numbers. In these cases it can happen that ; then &quot;inverse&quot; typically implies that an element is both a left and right inverse.

The notation &quot;f&quot; −1 is sometimes also used for the inverse function of the function &quot;f&quot;, which is for most functions not equal to the multiplicative inverse. For example, the multiplicative inverse is the cosecant of x, and not the inverse sine of &quot;x&quot; denoted by or . The terminology difference &quot;reciprocal&quot; versus &quot;inverse&quot; is not sufficient to make this distinction, since many authors prefer the opposite naming convention, probably for historical reasons (for example in French, the inverse function is preferably called the ).

==Examples and counterexamples==
In the real numbers, zero does not have a reciprocal (division by zero is undefined) because no real number multiplied by 0 produces 1 (the product of any number with zero is zero). With the exception of zero, reciprocals of every real number are real, reciprocals of every rational number are rational, and reciprocals of every complex number are complex. The property that every element other than zero has a multiplicative inverse is part of the definition of a field, of which these are all examples. On the other hand, no integer other than 1 and −1 has an integer reciprocal, and so the integers are not a field.

In modular arithmetic, the modular multiplicative inverse of &quot;a&quot; is also defined: it is the number &quot;x&quot; such that . This multiplicative inverse exists if and only if &quot;a&quot; and &quot;n&quot; are coprime. For example, the inverse of 3 modulo 11 is 4 because . The extended Euclidean algorithm may be used to compute it.

The sedenions are an algebra in which every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse, but which nonetheless has divisors of zero, that is, nonzero elements &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; such that &quot;xy&quot; = 0.

A square matrix has an inverse if and only if its determinant has an inverse in the coefficient ring. The linear map that has the matrix &quot;A&quot;−1 with respect to some base is then the inverse function of the map having &quot;A&quot; as matrix in the same base. Thus, the two distinct notions of the inverse of a function are strongly related in this case, but they still do not coincide, since the multiplicative inverse of &quot;Ax&quot; would be (&quot;Ax&quot;)−1, not &quot;A&quot;−1x.

These two notions of an inverse function do sometimes coincide, for example for the function formula_1 where formula_2 is the principal branch of the complex logarithm and formula_3:
:formula_4.

The trigonometric functions are related by the reciprocal identity: the cotangent is the reciprocal of the tangent; the secant is the reciprocal of the cosine; the cosecant is the reciprocal of the sine.

A ring in which every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse is a division ring; likewise an algebra in which this holds is a division algebra.

== Complex numbers ==
As mentioned above, the reciprocal of every nonzero complex number formula_5 is complex. It can be found by multiplying both top and bottom of 1/&quot;z&quot; by its complex conjugate formula_6 and using the property that formula_7, the absolute value of &quot;z&quot; squared, which is the real number :

:formula_8

The intuition is that
:formula_9
gives us the complex conjugate with a magnitude reduced to a value of formula_10, so dividing again by formula_11 ensures that the magnitude is now equal to the reciprocal of the original magnitude as well, hence:
:formula_12
In particular, if ||&quot;z&quot;||=1 (&quot;z&quot; has unit magnitude), then formula_13. Consequently, the imaginary units, , have additive inverse equal to multiplicative inverse, and are the only complex numbers with this property. For example, additive and multiplicative inverses of are and , respectively.

For a complex number in polar form , the reciprocal simply takes the reciprocal of the magnitude and the negative of the angle:

:formula_14

== Calculus ==
In real calculus, the derivative of is given by the power rule with the power −1:

:formula_15

The power rule for integrals (Cavalieri&#x27;s quadrature formula) cannot be used to compute the integral of 1/&quot;x&quot;, because doing so would result in division by 0:
formula_16
Instead the integral is given by:
formula_17
formula_18
where ln is the natural logarithm. To show this, note that formula_19, so if formula_20 and formula_21, we have:
formula_22

== Algorithms ==
The reciprocal may be computed by hand with the use of long division.

Computing the reciprocal is important in many division algorithms, since the quotient &quot;a&quot;/&quot;b&quot; can be computed by first computing 1/&quot;b&quot; and then multiplying it by &quot;a&quot;. Noting that formula_23 has a zero at &quot;x&quot; = 1/&quot;b&quot;, Newton&#x27;s method can find that zero, starting with a guess formula_24 and iterating using the rule:

:formula_25

This continues until the desired precision is reached. For example, suppose we wish to compute 1/17 ≈ 0.0588 with 3 digits of precision. Taking &quot;x&quot;0 = 0.1, the following sequence is produced:
:&quot;x&quot;1 = 0.1(2 − 17 × 0.1) = 0.03
:&quot;x&quot;2 = 0.03(2 − 17 × 0.03) = 0.0447
:&quot;x&quot;3 = 0.0447(2 − 17 × 0.0447) ≈ 0.0554
:&quot;x&quot;4 = 0.0554(2 − 17 × 0.0554) ≈ 0.0586
:&quot;x&quot;5 = 0.0586(2 − 17 × 0.0586) ≈ 0.0588
A typical initial guess can be found by rounding &quot;b&quot; to a nearby power of 2, then using bit shifts to compute its reciprocal.

In constructive mathematics, for a real number &quot;x&quot; to have a reciprocal, it is not sufficient that &quot;x&quot; ≠ 0. There must instead be given a &quot;rational&quot; number &quot;r&quot; such that 0 &lt; &quot;r&quot; &lt; |&quot;x&quot;|. In terms of the approximation algorithm described above, this is needed to prove that the change in &quot;y&quot; will eventually become arbitrarily small.

This iteration can also be generalized to a wider sort of inverses; for example, matrix inverses.

==Reciprocals of irrational numbers==
Every real or complex number excluding zero has a reciprocal, and reciprocals of certain irrational numbers can have important special properties. Examples include the reciprocal of &quot;e&quot; (≈ 0.367879) and the golden ratio&#x27;s reciprocal (≈ 0.618034). The first reciprocal is special because no other positive number can produce a lower number when put to the power of itself; formula_26 is the global minimum of formula_27. The second number is the only positive number that is equal to its reciprocal plus one:formula_28. Its additive inverse is the only negative number that is equal to its reciprocal minus one:formula_29.

The function formula_30 gives an infinite number of irrational numbers that differ with their reciprocal by an integer. For example, formula_31 is the irrational formula_32. Its reciprocal formula_33 is formula_34, exactly formula_35 less. Such irrational numbers share an evident property: they have the same fractional part as their reciprocal, since these numbers differ by an integer.

The reciprocal function plays an important role in simple continued fractions, which have a number of remarkable properties relating to the representation of (both rational and) irrational numbers.

==Further remarks==
If the multiplication is associative, an element &quot;x&quot; with a multiplicative inverse cannot be a zero divisor (&quot;x&quot; is a zero divisor if some nonzero &quot;y&quot;, ). To see this, it is sufficient to multiply the equation by the inverse of &quot;x&quot; (on the left), and then simplify using associativity. In the absence of associativity, the sedenions provide a counterexample.

The converse does not hold: an element which is not a zero divisor is not guaranteed to have a multiplicative inverse.
Within Z, all integers except −1, 0, 1 provide examples; they are not zero divisors nor do they have inverses in Z.
If the ring or algebra is finite, however, then all elements &quot;a&quot; which are not zero divisors do have a (left and right) inverse. For, first observe that the map must be injective: implies :
:formula_36
Distinct elements map to distinct elements, so the image consists of the same finite number of elements, and the map is necessarily surjective. Specifically, ƒ (namely multiplication by &quot;a&quot;) must map some element &quot;x&quot; to 1, , so that &quot;x&quot; is an inverse for &quot;a&quot;.

==Applications==

The expansion of the reciprocal 1/&quot;q&quot; in any base can also act as a source of pseudo-random numbers, if &quot;q&quot; is a &quot;suitable&quot; safe prime, a prime of the form 2&quot;p&quot; + 1 where &quot;p&quot; is also a prime. A sequence of pseudo-random numbers of length &quot;q&quot; − 1 will be produced by the expansion.

Celanese Corporation, formerly known as Hoechst Celanese, is an American technology and specialty materials company headquartered in Irving, Texas. It is a Fortune 500 corporation. The company is the world&#x27;s leading producer of acetic acid, producing about 1.95 million tonnes per year, representing approximately 25% of global production. Celanese is also the world&#x27;s largest producer of vinyl acetate monomer (VAM).

Celanese operates 25 production plants and six research centers in 11 countries, mainly in North America, Europe, and Asia. The company owns and operates the world&#x27;s three largest acetic acid plants: one in the Clear Lake area of Pasadena, Texas, one on Jurong Island in Singapore, and a third in Nanjing, China.

== History ==
In 1918, the American Cellulose &amp; Chemical Manufacturing Company (known as Amcelle) was founded in New York City by Swiss chemist Camille Dreyfus.

The American Cellulose and Chemical Manufacturing Co. Ltd plant in Cumberland, Maryland, was set up during World War I to produce cheaper fabric for airplane manufacturing. The plant location was chosen inland to protect against Zeppelin attacks. It was also situated in proximity to a ready source of water at the Potomac River and easy access to coal supplies and railroad lines. After a series of delays, production began on Christmas Day, 1924 with a series of cellulose acetate commercial fabrics and yarns intended as alternatives to silk. The plant was closed in 1983, and was later torn down to provide a space for a new state prison.

The company had introduced the word “Celanese,” a combination of “cellulose” and “ease” in 1925, seeking to promote the ease of cleaning and care of their acetate yarn, or artificial silk, fabrics. They officially took this name in 1927, becoming Celanese Corporation of America.

=== After World War II ===
In 1947, Celanese started producing acetate fiber at its plant near Ocotlán, Jalisco, Mexico. The plant was closed in 2019.

By 1958, Celanese had 13 domestic plants, three research and development centers, some 30 groups of products, and approximately 13,000 employees.

In 1959, Celanese commissioned Edward Durell Stone, a 20th-century American architect, to build the “Celanese House,” a model home in New Canaan, Connecticut, to showcase the company&#x27;s new materials and styles.
{{pic|Celanese spiral logo.svg|Logo introduced in the 1970s, designed by Saul Bass|upright=0.75}}

Celanese bought operations of the British chemicals firm Imperial Chemical Industries in 1982. This included the Fiber Industries Incorporated plant in Salisbury, North Carolina, a part of Invista since 2004.

In 1983, Celanese built a $20 million plant in Rock Hill, South Carolina, to produce polybenzimidazole (PBI), a material used to fabricate high-performance protective apparel used in firefighter&#x27;s gear and astronaut space suits.

Celanese spun off its pharmaceutical business as Celgene in 1986.

In 1987, Celanese Corporation was acquired by Hoechst and merged with its American subsidiary, American Hoechst, to form Hoechst Celanese Corporation.

In 1989, Hoechst Celanese moved to buy out the remaining shareholders of Hoescht Celanese Canada and thus to fully privatize the Canadian unit in a deal worth $210 million.

In 1998, in a $2.7 billion deal, Hoechst Celanese sold its Trevira division to a consortium between Houston-based KoSa, a joint venture of Koch Industries, IMASAB S.A., and Grupo Xtra, both of Mexico. Also in 1998, Hoechst combined most of its industrial chemical operations into a new company, Celanese AG.

In 1999, Hoechst spun off Celanese AG as a publicly traded German corporation, cross-listed on both the Frankfurt and New York stock exchanges as &quot;CZZ&quot; and &quot;CZ&quot;, respectively. This was done in a vast corporate restructuring associated with the parent&#x27;s merger with Rhone-Poulenc.

On 16 December 2003, the U.S. private equity firm Blackstone Group announced a takeover offer for Celanese, after two years of wooing management. Shareholders formally approved the offer from Blackstone on 16 June 2004, and Blackstone completed the acquisition of Celanese AG. The company was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange, and Blackstone changed the entity&#x27;s name back to Celanese Corporation. Under Blackstone, a number of streamlining initiatives were undertaken, and several acquisitions were made.

On 21 January 2005, Celanese Corporation conducted an initial public offering and became a publicly traded corporation traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol &quot;CE&quot;. When Blackstone sold the last of its shares in 2007, it had made five times what it had invested and it, and its co-investors collected a $2.9 billion profit.

In June 2009, the company sold its polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) business to Sekisui Chemical Co., Ltd.

Celanese has a process to make ethanol from natural gas.

In late 2020, Celanese sold their 45% stake in Polyplastics to Daicel, who already owned 55% of the company. This transaction resulted in Daicel attaining full ownership of Polyplastics.

===Class action lawsuits===

In 1985, Hoechst Celanese was named along with Shell Oil and US Brass as a defendant in a class action lawsuit for $7 billion in both past and potential future damages for which they were accused of being liable because of leaks in their polybutylene (PB) plumbing systems. The lawsuit alleged a complex scheme to mislead buyers into believing that PB plumbing systems were suitable for use as potable water distribution systems and purportedly enjoying a lifetime of 50 years service. According to the lawsuit, scientists from the defendants allegedly reported that the PB plumbing systems would degrade even when exposed to low concentrations of chlorine typically found in municipal water systems. The lawsuit claimed that in spite of this knowledge, the defendants concealed the information and continued to market these products (Shell supplying PB resins to water pipe manufacturers and Hoechst Celanese providing acetal resins to manufacturers of pipe fittings) until approximately 1996. The lawsuit was settled in 1995 for {{currency|950 million|US}}.

In January 2014, a class action lawsuit was filed on behalf of the citizens of Cannon&#x27;s Campground, seeking relief from health and environmental dangers posed by groundwater and surface water contamination emanating from the Hoechst-Celanese manufacturing plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina. The lawsuit alleged the dumping of a number of toxic chemicals into local waters, which has diminished property values and caused a number of illnesses. Hoechst Celanese asked the courts to dismiss these charges as spurious, claiming that its discharges have not caused substantial harm to anyone or to the environment, and further asserting that a 3-year limit on tort claims had expired, relieving the company of any responsibility for damages which might be eventually discovered.

== Products ==
===Acetyl intermediates===
Acetyl intermediates is Celanese&#x27;s largest segment, with a product range consisting of basic chemicals such as acetic acid, acetic anhydride, and vinyl acetate. Customers of acetyl intermediates and industrial specialties are in the chemical, paint and coatings, construction, and adhesive industries for polymerization.

===Advanced engineered materials===
Advanced engineered materials offers plastic polymers to customers in the automotive, electronics, telecommunications, and medical industries. Major products include engineered plastics for fuel system components (provided by Ticona, the engineering polymer business of Celanese), conveyor belts, electronics, safety systems, emissions filtration, and fluid handling. Polymer production is improved by the acquisition of SO.F.TER Group, Forlì, in Italy in 2016.

===Consumer specialties===
The food ingredients business Nutrinova produces the high intensity sweetener Sunett (acesulfame K), the preservatives Nutrinova, potassium sorbate, and sorbic acid, and other food ingredients. Major end-use markets include beverages, confections, baked goods, and dairy products. In 2021, Celanese ranked 7th on FoodTalks&#x27; Global Top 20 Food Preservative Companies list.

Celanese is one of the world&#x27;s largest producers of cellulose acetate. Acetate products are primarily used in cigarette filters, as well as in the production of fashion apparel and linings. Celanese also manufactures Clarifoil cellulose acetate film that is wood pulp based and certified biodegradable and compostable in home and industrial composting conditions.

===Industrial specialties===
Industrial specialties, using the feedstock from acetyl intermediates, manufactures polymer and emulsions such as polyvinyl acetate emulsions, and specialty chemicals as ethylene vinyl acetate. Major end-use markets include polyvinyl alcohol producers, paper, mortar and gypsum, textiles, paints, coatings, and adhesives manufacturers.

===Advanced fuel technology===
TCX Technology is a hydrocarbon-based ethanol production process developed and marketed by Celanese and launched in November 2010. Celanese researchers developed the TCX Technology to create a fuel that helps countries reduce their need to import oil and gas. Celanese plans to invest $700 million to build one-to-two plants in China and one in Texas that will produce TCX-based ethanol.

<text>The Ilyushin Il-76 (; NATO reporting name: Candid) is a multi-purpose, fixed-wing, four-engine turbofan strategic airlifter designed by the Soviet Union&#x27;s Ilyushin design bureau as a commercial freighter in 1967, to replace the Antonov An-12. It was developed to deliver heavy machinery to remote and poorly served areas. Military versions of the Il-76 have been widely used in Europe, Asia and Africa, including use as an aerial refueling tanker and command center.

The Il-76 has seen extensive service as a commercial freighter for ramp-delivered cargo, especially for outsized or heavy items that cannot be carried by other means. It has also been used as an emergency response transport for civilian evacuations as well as for humanitarian aid and disaster relief around the world. Thanks to its ability to operate from unpaved runways, it has been useful in undeveloped areas. Specialized models have also been produced for aerial firefighting and zero-G training.

==Design and development==
===Origins===
The aircraft was conceived by Ilyushin in 1967 to meet a requirement for a freighter able to carry a payload of over a range of in less than six hours, able to operate from short and unprepared airstrips, and capable of coping with the worst weather conditions likely to be experienced in Siberia and the Soviet Union&#x27;s Arctic regions. It was intended to replace the Antonov An-12. Another project design for a double-decked 250-passenger airliner was cancelled. The Il-76 first flew in .

Production of Il-76s was allocated to the Tashkent Aviation Production Association in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, then a republic of the Soviet Union. Some 860 of the basic transport variants were manufactured. In the 1990s, modernized variants also equipped with Soloviev D-30 turbofan engines were developed (MF, TF), with a cargo compartment long by wide by tall; these larger variants were not produced in significant quantity due to the financial difficulties being experienced by the Russian Air Force, which was the primary operator of the type.

===Further development===
From 2004 onwards, a number of aircraft in commercial service were modernized to the Il-76TD-90VD version; this involved the adoption of the newly developed PS-90 engine to comply with European noise limitations. In 2005, the People&#x27;s Republic of China placed an order for 34 new Il-76MDs and four Il-78 tankers. In June 2013, Russian military export agency Rosoboronexport announced an order by China for 12 Il-76MD aircraft.

The Il-76 has also been modified into an airborne refuelling tanker, designated the Il-78, around 50 aircraft having been produced. A variant of the Il-76 also serves as a firefighting waterbomber. Its airframe was used as a base for the Beriev A-50 &#x27;Mainstay&#x27; AEW&amp;C (airborne early warning and control) aircraft; around 25 aircraft were made. Another application for the type was found in Antarctic support flights and for conducting simulated weightlessness training for cosmonauts (akin to the &quot;Vomit Comet&quot; used by NASA). Beriev and NPO Almaz also developed an airborne laser flying laboratory designated A-60, of which two were built, much of this project&#x27;s details remaining classified.

===Il-76MD-90A===
It was announced in 2010 that the production of a modernized Il-76, the Il-76MD-90A (also known as &quot;project Il-476&quot; during the design stage), would begin; a proposed new production line would be located in Aviastar&#x27;s facility in Ulyanovsk, Russia, and be operated in cooperation with the Tashkent works. At that point, the construction of two Il-76MD-90A prototypes had begun at the Ulyanovsk facility. The first Il-76MD-90A was rolled out at Aviastar&#x27;s Ulyanovsk plant on 16 June 2014. On 29 April 2015, it was reported that the Russian Aerospace Forces received the first Il-76MD-90A built at the Ulyanovsk plant &quot;Aviastar-SP&quot; from the 2012 contract for 39 aircraft. The Russian Ministry of Defence (MoD) received its first serial production Ilyushin Il-76MD-90A airlifter on 2 April 2019. As of late 2024, 27 aircraft are ordered to be delivered in the period up to 2028 and 26 had been built, six in 2023 and six in 2024.

==Operational history==
The first aircraft was delivered to the Soviet Air Force in June 1974 and subsequently became the main Soviet strategic transport aircraft. From 1976, it was operated by Aeroflot.
Between 1979 and 1991, Soviet Air Force Il-76s made 14,700 flights into Afghanistan, transporting 786,200 servicemen and 315,800 tons of freight. The Il-76 carried 89% of Soviet troops and 74% of the freight that was airlifted. As Afghan rebels were unable to shoot down high-flying Il-76s, their tactics were to try and damage it on takeoff or landing. Il-76s were often hit by shoulder-launched Stinger and Strela heat-seeking missiles and large-calibre machine gun fire, but because the strong airframes were able to take substantial damage and remain operational, the aircraft had a remarkably low attrition rate during this period of conflict. Building on that experience, the bulk of the Canadian Forces equipment into Afghanistan was flown in using civilian Il-76s. In 2006, the Russian Air Force had about 200 Il-76s. Civilian users in Russia have 108.
In 2004, a Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) Il-76 carried out a flight mission in Afghanistan, and later in 2011, PLAAF Il-76s were sent to Libya to evacuate Chinese citizens. The two missions were the reported first steps of PLAAF developing long-range transportation capability.

Syrian Air Force Il-76s, operating as civil Syrianair aircraft, have been reportedly used to ship weapons, money, and other cargo from Russia and Iran to Syria, according to a defected Syrian military pilot. Since the start of the war, in April 2011 (and up to July 2012), around 20 military flights have been conducted to and from Tehran, via Iraqi airspace. Further information exposes that since around 2012, Syrian Il-76s have regularly flown to Moscow&#x27;s Vnukovo Airport to fetch shipments of Syrian banknotes that have been useful to Bashar al-Assad&#x27;s government to survive international sanctions.

On 30 January 2017, an Il-76 firebomber of the Russian EMERCOM agency was deployed to Chile to assist firefighters. The assignment took 39 days.

All Il-76 transport aircraft in service with the RF Aerospace Forces were to receive anti-missile systems, and aircraft reconfiguration started in spring 2019.

<doc id="229954" wikidata="Q939354" url="?curid=229954" title="Vooruit (political party)">
<text>Vooruit (; Dutch for Onward) is a Flemish social democratic political party in Belgium. It was known as the (Flemish) Socialist Party (1978–2001: &quot;Socialistische Partij&quot;, SP; 2001–2021: &quot;Socialistische Partij Anders&quot;, SP.A) until 21 March 2021, when its current name was adopted.

The party was founded following the linguistic split of the unitary Belgian Socialist Party in 1978, which also produced the Francophone Socialist Party. The Belgian Socialist Party itself consisted of former members of the Belgian Labour Party. From December 2011 to September 2014, the party was part of the Di Rupo Government, along with its Francophone counterpart. In 2020, it re-entered federal government as part of the De Croo Government. The party has been a part of the Flemish Government several times.

== History ==
=== 1885–1940 ===
=== 1940–1978 ===
=== Since 1978 ===
The party was the big winner in the 2003 election, running on the SP.A–Spirit joint list (cartel) with the social-liberal party Spirit. Their share of the vote went up from 9% (of the total Belgian vote) to almost 15%, a second place in the number of votes. The main victim of this resurgence was the Green! party (formerly known as &quot;Agalev&quot;). SP.A was part of the &quot;purple&quot; federal coalitions of Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt from 12 July 1999 until 10 June 2007, which contained both the Flemish and Francophone liberal and social-democratic parties.

In 2004, the SP.A along with its partner Spirit lost the elections for the Flemish Parliament. Although they won more seats in comparison to the Flemish elections of 1999, their percentage of the vote compared to the successful 2003 federal elections was considerably down. The reputation of then party leader Steve Stevaert took a beating too.

The party was briefly led by Caroline Gennez, after former president Steve Stevaert left to become governor of Limburg. Johan Vande Lanotte, who served as Minister of the Budget in the federal Government, was elected President and resigned as minister to become President on 17 October 2005. He resigned 11 June 2007, after SP.A–Spirit lost the elections for the federal parliament of 10 June 2007. In these federal elections, the cartel won 14 out of 150 seats in the Chamber of Representatives and 4 out of 40 seats in the Senate. Afterwards, Caroline Gennez was elected President by the party members.

As of May 2009, SP.A was in opposition in federal politics. Unlike its Francophone counterpart, the Socialist Party (PS), SP.A was not a participant in the Leterme II Government.

In January 2009, the party had apparently changed its name to Socialists and Progressive Differently (Dutch: &quot;Socialisten en Progressieven Anders&quot;). This name change was retracted and the party baseline was changed from Social Progressive Alternative (Dutch: &quot;Sociaal Progressief Alternatief&quot;) to Socialists and Progressive Differently (Dutch: &quot;Socialisten en Progressieven Anders&quot;).

In the 2010 federal election, SP.A won 13 seats with 9% of the overall vote. The party was a member of the Di Rupo Government formed on 6 December 2011, until the elections in 2014. In the elections for the Chamber of Representatives on 25 May 2014, SP.A scored again 9% and received 13 seats, in contrast to their francophone Socialist Party counterparts, who lost 3 seats and whose share of the vote decreased by 2%. In the Flemish Parliament, SP.A have 18 representatives, deriving from around 14% of the vote—this is a small reduction on the 2009 parliament, where SP.A had 19 seats, deriving from 15% of the popular vote. From 2009–2014, SP.A participated in the Flemish Government, in an uneasy coalition with the CD &amp; V and the N-VA. From 2014 onwards, SP.A formed part of the opposition in Flanders, as the regional government reflected the Flemish component of the federal administration, consisting of coalition of the Open-VLD, CD &amp; V and the N-VA.
In January 2018, the party advocated for a &quot;new socialism&quot; and a &quot;new equality&quot;. In September 2020, party leader Conner Rousseau announced a renaming of the party to &quot;Vooruit&quot; (&quot;Forward&quot;). The new name was made official on 21 March 2021.

==Political views==
Vooruit is a centre-left Flemish social democratic party. Equal opportunities and solidarity are central to the party. The party strives to ensure that those who earn the most or own the greatest wealth also pay the highest taxes so that the government can meet the needs of people who are less fortunate. Vooruit focuses on protecting the purchasing power of ordinary citizens. It opposes cuts in social security and advocates investment, especially in education and health care.

<text>Anne Marsh Caldwell (August 30, 1867 – October 22, 1936), also known as Anne Caldwell O&#x27;Dea, was an American playwright and lyricist. She wrote both pop songs and Broadway shows, sometimes working with composer Jerome Kern.

== Biography ==
Anne Marsh Caldwell was born in Boston, Massachusetts. She began her career at the Juvenile Opera Co. as one of only four female songwriters active in the early 1900s. She was a charter member of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, where her output between 1907 through 1928 focused mainly on Broadway scores. 

In 1929, lured by producer William LeBaron, she went to Hollywood where she became a script doctor and wrote lyrics for RKO Pictures. It was announced that she was engaged by Max Hart to write songs with Harry Tierny. By October, she was signed to write the lyrics for the film &quot;Dixiana&quot;.

From 1900 to the mid-1920s, she mostly collaborated with composer Jerome Kern. Her first collaboration with Kern was the musical, &quot;She’s a Good Fellow&quot;, followed by &quot;The Night Boat&quot; (1920), and &quot;Sally&quot; (1920). &quot;The Night Boat&quot; was one of Caldwell and Kern&#x27;s more successful shows but is generally not considered revivable today. The plots and comedy of their shows don’t satisfy contemporary audiences. Her final credited work was a radio adaptation of the 1933 film (on which she had also worked) &quot;Flying Down to Rio&quot;.

Until the careers of Caldwell, along with Rida Johnson Young and Dorothy Donnelly, writing American musical comedy was a male profession. They helped established the idea that a female writer could create works for the stage that were equally as satirical, witty, timely, and simply as comical as the work of any man.

Caldwell married William L. Vinal on August 2, 1885, in Manhattan, New York. They had a daughter, Marianna Sarah &quot;Molly&quot; Vinal (1886–1950). William Vinal was killed on March 4, 1897, in a gas explosion in Boston on the Tremont Street Subway at the Boylston station. She remarried lyricist James J. O&#x27;Dea on August 15, 1904, in Brooklyn.

==Death==
She died in Beverly Hills, California, following a short illness. Her son, Anthony Patrick O&#x27;Day, and daughter, Molly O&#x27;Day (née Marianna Sarah Vinal), were with her at the time of her death.

== Legacy ==
Upon her passing, &quot;Variety&quot; called her &quot;one of the most prolific librettists known to show business. A quiet, unassuming woman she developed a technique that rarely failed and was both book writer and lyricist.&quot; She was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970.

<text>Groen (; ), founded as Agalev, is a green Flemish political party in Belgium. The main pillars of the party are social justice, human rights, and ecologism. Its French-speaking equivalent is Ecolo; the two parties maintain close relations with each other.

==History==

=== Agalev ===
In 1979, the green party was founded by name of &quot;Agalev&quot;, an acronym of &quot;Anders Gaan Leven&quot; (&quot;Towards Different Living&quot;). During the eighties, the party was known for being against nuclear weapons, and for being pro-Europe.

In 1992 Agalev was asked to support a constitutional change called the Sint-Michiels agreement, which would make Belgium a federation. This change required a two-third majority, so the majority needed to convince some parties of the opposition to proceed. Both Agalev and Ecolo agreed, in exchange for a tax on bottles, the first ecotax in Belgium. However, after the constitutional change was voted in, the ecotax was cancelled and replaced by a watered-down concept.

In the elections of 1999, Agalev scored 7% federally and 11% regionally (in Flanders). The Dioxin affair, a scandal surrounding dioxine in for-consumption chickens just before the elections, played an important role in the Greens&#x27; performance. The Greens joined the first Verhofstadt government as part of the &quot;purple-green&quot; federal coalition from 12 July 1999 until 18 May 2003. Representing Agalev in this federal government, Magda Aelvoet was Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of Consumer Affairs, Public Health and the Environment. She tabled legislation on gay marriage, making Belgium the second country in the world to legalise same-sex marriage.
Within the same legislature, Magda Aelvoet left her position due to her opposition of a Belgian arms delivery to Nepal, and was succeeded by fellow party member Jef Tavernier.

Also following the elections of 1999, the party joined the Flemish Government, which was composed of the same parties. Agalev supplied two ministers: Mieke Vogels became responsible for Wellbeing, Health and Equal opportunities, and Vera Dua for Agriculture and Environment.

=== Renaming to Groen! (2003) ===

In the federal elections of 2003, Agalev scored less than 5% and lost all their seats (on the federal level). The next day, Jos Geysels resigned as party leader. The sitting ministers in the Flemish government Mieke Vogels and Vera Dua stepped down, and were replaced by and respectively.

Vera Dua got elected as chairperson, and on the same day, the party&#x27;s name was changed to Groen! (&quot;Green!&quot;). The party got between 5 and 10% of the votes through the elections of the early 00&#x27;s. They did not participate in a governmental coalition (on any level higher than local).

=== Groen (2012–present) ===
In 2012 the party decided to drop de exclamation mark of their name.

After the local and provincial elections of 2014, Groen had a mandate for the first time in the province of Flemish-Brabant. In 2018 the province of East-Flanders followed. The results in Flemish-Brabant had improved though Green wasn&#x27;t part of the coalition anymore after these elections.

In 2019, there were elections on the regional, federal and European level. At this time the school strike for climate movement had dominated the media, so the party Groen was expected to grow substantially. An total victory didn&#x27;t happen, though the party gained seats on all levels.

On the regional level of Brussels-Capital, Groen participated in a red-green-blue coalition. Elke Van den Brandt became Minister of Mobility, Public Works, and Road Safety.

On the federal level, a new government wasn&#x27;t formed until 17 March 2020, when the coronavirus outbreak urged a minority government with extra plenary powers to be formed. After 6 months a &#x27;regular&#x27; majority government was formed and the Vivaldi coalition was sworn in with 2 Groen ministers. Petra De Sutter became Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Civil Service, Public Enterprises, Telecommunication and Postal Services, as Europe&#x27;s first transgender deputy prime minister. Tinne Van der Straeten holds the Ministry of Energy.

In 2022 the members of Groen elected new party leaders: the duo Nadia Naji and Jeremie Vaneeckhout, and the logo changed from green only to a more colourful background.

==Political views==
Groen is a progressive Flemish party that, as the name itself suggests, considers environmental and climate policy very important. The party wants to combine this with attention to social justice, equal opportunities, human rights and quality of life. In other words, the party wants to protect the planet, but wants to do so by paying attention to the weakest in society. The party therefore wants good and affordable health care and to tackle poverty. In order to afford these initiatives, the party expect the richest people and the biggest polluters in society to contribute more.

<text>Feral pigeons (&quot;Columba livia domestica&quot; or &quot;Columba livia forma urbana&quot;), also called city doves, city pigeons, or street pigeons, are descendants of domestic pigeons (&quot;Columba livia domestica&quot;) living independently from and often unwanted by humans, having gone &quot;feral&quot;. Rock, domestic, and feral pigeons are all the same species and will readily interbreed. Many domestic birds have gotten lost, escaped or been released over the years, and these gave rise to populations of feral pigeons.

Feral pigeons inhabit man-made structures such as buildings as a substitute for cliffs and other rock formations. Their domestic ancestry predisposed them to living near humans, and they subsequently became adapted to urban life, being abundant in towns and cities throughout much of the world. They are often described as a public nuisance, being a potential reservoir of disease and cause of property damage, through their habits and numbers. Several authorities, including municipalities consider them to be pests and an invasive species, often disparagingly referred to as &quot;rats with wings&quot;. Actions are taken in many municipalities to lower their numbers or completely eradicate them.

==Description==
Feral pigeons are essentially the same size and shape as the original, wild rock dove, but often display far greater variation in colour and pattern than their wild ancestors owing to domestic ancestors. Their conformity to the wild phenotype&#x27;s shape and size is considered to be the result of natural selection acting upon the population of now free-living birds, shifting the population closer to the form of their distant, wild ancestor. Local selective pressures have been suggested to explain the geographical variation across feral pigeons in the United States.

The blue-barred pattern which the original wild rock dove displays is generally less common in more urban areas. Pigeons feathers have two types of melanin (pigment) – eumelanin and pheomelanin. A study of melanin in the feathers of both wild rock and domestic pigeons, of different coloration types and known genetic background, measured the concentration, distribution and proportions of eumelanin and pheomelanin and found that gene mutations affecting the distribution, amounts and proportions of pigments accounted for the greater variation of coloration in domesticated birds than in their wild relations. Eumelanin generally causes grey or black coloration, while pheomelanin results in a reddish-brown colour. Other shades of brown may be produced through different combinations and concentrations of the two colours. Urban pigeons tend to have darker plumage than those in more rural areas. Darker birds may be better able to store trace metals in their feathers due to their higher concentrations of melanin, which may help mitigate the negative effects of the metals, the concentrations of which are typically higher in urban areas.

The avoidance of mating between related individuals is ordinarily regarded as adaptive since it decreases the likelihood of inbreeding depression in progeny that can be caused by the expression of deleterious recessive alleles. However in feral pigeons it was found that despite detectable inbreeding depression, pairwise relatedness between mates was significantly greater than it was between nonmates. This suggests that mating with close kin provides inclusive fitness benefits that outweigh the costs of inbreeding depression.
Studies of feral pigeons in a semi-rural part of Kansas found that their diet includes the following: 92% maize, 3.2% oats, 3.7% cherry, along with small amounts of knotweed, elm, poison ivy and barley. They have been observed to eat insects and spiders. Pigeons tend to congregate in large, dense flocks when feeding on discarded food. In cities they typically resort to scavenging human garbage, as unprocessed grain may be impossible to find. Pigeon groups typically consist of producers, which locate and obtain food, and scroungers, which feed on food obtained by the producers. Generally, groups of pigeons contain a greater proportion of scroungers than producers. Feral pigeons can be seen eating grass seeds and berries in parks and gardens in the spring, but plentiful sources exist throughout the year from scavenging (e.g., food remnants left inside of dropped fast food cartons, in the form of popcorn, cake, peanuts, bread and currants) Food is also procured from waste bins. Bird feeders, often tourists or residents who feed pigeons, do so for reasons such as empathy, fun, tradition and as a means for social interaction. 

===Diseases===

Feral pigeons can be reservoirs and vectors of some human and livestock diseases, such as salmonellosis and tuberculosis. However, it is rare that a pigeon will transmit a disease to humans due to their immune system. Although feral pigeons pose sporadic health risks to humans, the risk is low, even for humans involved in occupations that bring them into close contact with nesting sites. Analysis revealed that feral pigeons harbored a total of 60 different human pathogenic organisms. Five pathogens were viruses, nine were bacteria, 45 were fungi, and one was a protozoan. However, only five pathogens were routinely transmitted to humans.
==== Parasites ====

Pigeons may harbour a diverse parasite fauna. They often host the intestinal helminths &quot;Capillaria columbae&quot; and &quot;Ascaridia columbae&quot;. Their ectoparasites include the ischnoceran lice &quot;Columbicola columbae&quot;, &quot;Campanulotes bidentatus compar&quot;, the amblyceran lice &quot;Bonomiella columbae&quot;, &quot;Hohorstiella lata&quot;, &quot;Colpocephalum turbinatum&quot;, the mites &quot;Tinaminyssus melloi&quot;, &quot;Dermanyssus gallinae&quot;, &quot;Dermoglyphus columbae&quot;, &quot;Falculifer rostratus&quot; and &quot;Diplaegidia columbae&quot;. The hippoboscid fly &quot;Pseudolynchia canariensis&quot; is a typical blood-sucking ectoparasite of pigeons in tropical and subtropical regions. The avian mites can infest human habitation and bite humans, a condition known as gamasoidosis. However, cases of them infesting mammals is relatively rare.

==== Pathogens ====
Avian influenza (bird flu) has been extensively studied in pigeons. Studies has shown that adult pigeons are not clinically susceptible to nor carry H5N1, and that they do not transmit the virus to poultry. Other studies have presented evidence of clinical signs and neurological lesions resulting from infection but found that the pigeons did not transmit the disease to poultry reared in direct contact with them. Pigeons were found to be &quot;resistant or minimally susceptible&quot; to other strains of avian influenza, such as the H7N7. Three studies since the late 1990s were performed by the US Agriculture Department&#x27;s Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory in Athens, Georgia, according to the center&#x27;s director, David Swayne. The lab has been working on bird flu since the 1970s. In one experiment, researchers squirted into pigeons&#x27; mouths liquid drops that contained the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus from a Hong Kong sample. The birds received 100 to 1,000 times the concentration that wild birds would encounter in nature. &quot;We couldn&#x27;t infect the pigeons&quot;, Swayne said. &quot;So that&#x27;s good news.&quot;

&quot;Chlamydophila psittaci&quot; is endemic among pigeons and causes psittacosis in humans. It is generally transmitted from handling pigeons or their droppings (more commonly the latter). Psittacosis is a serious disease but rarely fatal (less than 1%). 

Pigeons are also important vectors for various species of the bacteria &quot;Salmonella&quot;, which causes diseases such as salmonellosis and paratyphoid fever. There were single case incidences for transmission of &quot;Salmonella enterica&quot;. 

Pigeons are not a major concern in the spread of West Nile virus: though they can contract it, they apparently do not transmit it to humans. 

==Impact==

Feral pigeons often only have small populations within cities relative to the number of humans. For example, the breeding population of feral pigeons in Sheffield, England in summer 2005 was estimated at 12,130 individuals (95% confidence interval 7757–18,970), in a city with a human population of about 500,000. Despite this, feral pigeons usually reach their highest densities in the central portions of cities, so they are frequently encountered by people, which may lead to conflict.

Pigeons can compete with native birds for nest sites, which could become a conservation issue for seabirds. 

The scarcity of the pure wild rock dove is partly due to interbreeding with feral birds.

=== Feces ===
Healthy, well-fed pigeons excrete feces that are composed largely of a brown to greenish-brown mass with a white cap; the white cap is composed of uric acid crystals, with some of the uric acid dissolved within urea that comprises the liquid urine, which is transparent and often absorbed by the mass of solid waste of the feces, which maintains its shape when the bird is in good health. The color of the resultant fecal matter is helpful in diagnosing the condition of the bird; droppings which appear dull yellow is indicative of starvation especially if watery, green may be a sign of liver disease due to an abundance of excreted biliverdin, bright green being an abundance of passed bile implying bowel problems or not having eaten recently, and red-brown showing kidney disease. 

Contact with pigeon droppings poses a minor risk of contracting histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis and psittacosis, Pigeon feces has been implicated as a &quot;contributing factor&quot; a cryptococcus infection leading to the death of a child.

It is often claimed that feral pigeon feces cause substantial economic losses from property damage, often said to be from their corrosive droppings damaging stone edifices and metal structures.
==Protection status==
In the United Kingdom, pigeons are covered under the &quot;General Licences&quot; and can be humanely culled by the land owner or their agent for a variety of reasons including spread of human disease. It is illegal to kill/destroy nests for any reason other than those listed under the general licences.

In the U.S., the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, which protects native birds, does not apply to feral pigeons, common starlings or house sparrows, because they are introduced species. It is usually legal to kill feral pigeons in the United States; methods such as poisons may be regulated, however. Pigeons are labeled an invasive species in North America by the USDA.

In India, pigeons are protected under Section 428 and Section 429 of the Indian Penal Code. Wild pigeons are further protected under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.

== Control methods ==

Deterrence methods include bird spikes and the recently introduced optical gel deterrent.
===Predators===
Peregrine falcons, which are also originally cliff dwellers, have also adapted to the skyscrapers of large cities and often feed exclusively on rock doves. Some cities actively encourage this through falcon breeding programs. Projects include the Unibase Falcon Project and the Victorian Peregrine Project. Other species of falcons have also been observed to hunt down ferals.

Other predators of the pigeon have been recorded, including Eurasian sparrowhawks, crows and gulls. Larger birds of prey occasionally take advantage of these pigeons as well. Goshawks have been known to specialize on feral pigeons even outside of urban settings. In New York City, the abundance of feral pigeons (and other small animals) has created such a conducive environment for predators that the red-tailed hawk has begun to return in very small numbers, including the notable Pale Male.

Other common predators of feral pigeons in North America are raccoons, opossums, great horned owls, and eastern screech owls. The birds that prey on pigeons in North America can range in size from American kestrels to golden eagles 

In London, the population of great white pelicans at St. James&#x27;s Park has also been recorded killing and consuming pigeons even when alternative food sources are available. In cities in Western Europe, European herring gulls may occasionally hunt and consume feral pigeons in addition to other birds and small mammals. 

Despite their importance in the diet of urban predatory birds, feral pigeons are known to transmit several diseases to their consumers, as they may be reservoirs of several avian diseases, often subclinically. Raptors may contract West Nile Virus through consumption of infected bird species, such as crows, house sparrows, and pigeons. Trichomoniasis, frounce, or canker is a significant disease in raptors both captive and wild-living. Symptoms include plaques in and around the oropharynx, and lesions may be found in the lungs, air sacs, sinuses, ear canal and kidneys. The lesions may progress into severe necroses, at least of the upper digestive tract. Trich has been found to be resistant to several drug treatments, and it is thought that &quot;preventive treatments&quot; that use insufficient dosages may be one of the causes. These diseases may prove to be fatal to the raptors; Columbid Herpesvirus-1 has a near 100% mortality rate in raptors.

===Poison===
Due to their non-selective nature, most avian poisons have been banned. In the United States market, only 4-aminopyridine (Avitrol) and DRC-1339 remain registered by EPA. DRC-1339 is limited to USDA use only, while 4-AP is a restricted-use pesticide, for use only by licensed applicators.

The use of poisons has been proven to be fairly ineffective, however, as pigeons can breed very quickly, and their numbers are determined by how much food is available; that is, they breed more often when more food is provided to them. When pigeons are poisoned, surviving birds do not leave the area. On the contrary, they are left with more food per bird than before. This attracts pigeons from outside areas as well as encouraging more breeding, and populations are re-established quickly. An additional problem with poisoning is that it also kills pigeon predators. Due to this, in cities with peregrine falcon programs it is typically illegal to poison pigeons.

===Reducing food supply===
A more effective tactic to reduce the number of feral pigeons is deprivation. Cities around the world have discovered that not feeding their local birds results in a steady population decrease in only a few years. As scavengers, pigeons will still pick at garbage bags containing discarded food or at leftovers carelessly dropped on the ground, but securely disposing of foodstuffs will greatly reduce scavenger populations. Feeding of pigeons is banned in parts of Venice, Italy.

Long-term reduction of feral pigeon populations can be achieved by restricting food supply, which in turn involves legislation and litter (garbage) control. Some cities have deliberately established favorable nesting places for pigeons—nesting places that can easily be reached by city workers who regularly remove eggs, thereby limiting their reproductive success. In addition, pigeon populations may be reduced by bird control systems that successfully reduce nesting sites.

===Avian contraceptives===

In 1998, in response to conservation groups and the public interest, the National Wildlife Research Center (NWRC), a USDA/APHIS laboratory in Fort Collins, Colorado, started work on nicarbazin, a promising compound for avian contraception. Originally developed for use in resident Canada geese, nicarbazin was introduced for use as a contraceptive for feral pigeons in 2007.

The active ingredient, nicarbazin, interferes with the viability of eggs by binding the ZP-3 sperm receptor site in the egg. This unique contraceptive action is non-hormonal and fully reversible.

Registered by the EPA as a pesticide (EPA Reg. No. 80224-1), &quot;OvoControl P&quot;, brand of nicarbazin, is increasingly used in urban areas and industrial sites to control pigeon populations. Declared safe and humane, the new technology is environmentally benign and does not represent a secondary toxicity hazard to raptors or scavengers.

Avian contraception has the support of a range of animal welfare groups including the Humane Society of the United States, the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. Avian contraceptives are also perceived by some civilians as an acceptable method for population control, over other methods such as prohibition to feeding or extermination.

===Dummy egg nesting===

When eggs are removed in artificial pigeon houses, the interval between reproductive attempts is strongly reduced, which reduces the efficiency of the method. Dummy egg nesting programs have therefore been tested in some cities with mixed results. There, the eggs are removed and replaced with dummy eggs. The real eggs are then destroyed. One such structure, in Batman Park in Melbourne, Australia, was unsuccessful in attracting pigeons and has since been removed. The loft used in Melbourne was on stilts, with a cage door allowing access from beneath for accessing the structure at night when the pigeons are asleep.

== Monitoring pigeon population ==
Estimating the population size of pigeons is necessary for monitoring and control programs of pigeons in parks and other urban areas. The methods used for estimating populations sizes are:
* Stratified grids: This method consists in dividing the area where pigeons occur in 500x500m squares. 34% of the squares are selected randomly and pigeons are counted in a 5 meters radius for 5 minutes.
* Point-counts: standing in the center of a park, the observer makes a 360 degree turn while counting individuals with a manual mechanical counter in a radius of approximately 50m, limited by the streets and buildings that surround the park.
* Panoramas: taking 360 panoramic photographs, while standing at the center of the park, and using software to place a number above the counted pigeon in the panoramic photograph. This method has been proven the most effective of all.

==City squares famous for pigeons==
Many city squares have large pigeon populations, such as Washington Square Park in New York City, George Square in Glasgow, the Piazza San Marco in Venice, Dam Square in Amsterdam, The Gateway of India and Kabutarkhana in Mumbai and (prior to 2000) Trafalgar Square in London.
A tall statue of a pigeon by artist Paul Sloan was installed at the Rundle Mall, Adelaide, South Australia, adding to their collection of art installations, including statues of pigs. Sloan intended to &quot;elevate the humble pigeon&quot; with his work titled &quot;Pigeon&quot;. The mirrored stainless steel statue cost AU$174,000. While the installation has been talked up by City of Adelaide Lord Mayor Sandy Verschoor, some locals have responded negatively.

<text>Otto Kretschmer (1 May 1912 – 5 August 1998) was a German naval officer and submariner in World War II and the Cold War.

From September 1939 until his capture in March 1941 he sank 44 ships, including one warship, a total of 274,333 tons. For this he received the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords, among other awards. He earned the nickname &quot;Silent Otto&quot;, both for his successful use of the &quot;silent running&quot; capability of U-boats and for his reluctance to transmit radio messages during patrols. After the war he served in the German Federal Navy, from which he retired in 1970 with the flag rank of commodore.

==Early life and career==
Kretschmer was born in Heidau near Neisse, then in the German Empire on 1 May 1912 to Friedrich Wilhelm Otto and Alice (née Herbig) Kretschmer. His father was a teacher at the local &quot;Volkschule&quot; (primary school), which Otto attended from 1918 to 1921. He then moved to a &quot;Realgymnasium&quot; (secondary school). In the aftermath of World War I the Kretschmer family remained aloof from the political turbulence of the Weimar era. Kretschmer indulged in sporting pastimes and scientific interests. Kretschmer achieved good results in mathematics and chemistry and passed his &quot;Abitur&quot; (school-leaving certificate) at 17. The report contained the remark, &quot;Kretschmer demonstrated his extraordinary courage in many instances. He wants to be a naval officer.&quot; Kretschmer was too young to enlist at 17 and his father sent him to England to broaden his horizons. He enrolled at Exeter University (then University College of the South West of England) and studied under Professor Jacob Wilhelm Schopp (b. 1871), a German–born naturalised Briton. He mastered the English language and came to respect British education: its practical focus complemented his scientific and theoretical–based German background. His time in England shaped his view of them during the war; he was quick to believe in rumours of new British inventions during the war at sea. He returned home upon his mother&#x27;s death from tetanus in a medical malpractice incident. He did not return to England from his hiatus, but travelled through France, Switzerland and Italy.

===&quot;Reichsmarine&quot;===

Kretschmer entered the &quot;Reichsmarine&quot; (Weimar Navy) on 1 April 1930 as &quot;See Offizier Anwärter&quot; (naval officer cadet). Kretschmer formed part of &quot;Crew 30&quot; (the incoming class of 1930), 78–strong intake of officer candidates. He underwent basic military training in the 2nd department of the standing ship division of the Baltic Sea in Stralsund (1 April 1930 – 30 June 1930). Kretschmer was transferred to the training ship &quot;Niobe&quot; (1 July 1930 – 9 October 1930), attaining the rank of &quot;Seekadett&quot; (cadet) on 9 October 1930 before embarking on a 14-month stay on board the cruiser &quot;Emden&quot; (10 October 1930 – 4 January 1932), which took him to the Far East through the Mediterranean and Suez Canal. The &quot;Emden&quot; made stops in Ceylon, the Philippines, China and Japan; then Guam, South Africa, Angola and Spain on the return journey. A month after the &quot;Emden&quot;&#x27;s return to Wilhelmshaven on 2 December 1931, Kretschmer and his crew mates were promoted to the rank of &quot;Fähnrich zur See&quot; (midshipman) on 1 January 1932.

Following his journey on &quot;Emden&quot;, Kretschmer attended a naval infantry course for cadets at Stralsund (5 January–31 March 1932), before starting with the main cadet course at the Naval Academy Mürwik on 1 April 1932. This course was interrupted by two brief assignments on the survey vessel &quot;Meteor&quot; (22–25 June 1932 and 10–15 October 1932) for navigation training. His training included a pathfinder course for cadets at Kiel (28 March −22 April 1933), an artillery course for cadets at Kiel-Wik (23 April – 28 June 1933), a torpedo course in Mürwik (29 June – 18 August 1933), an anti-aircraft artillery course at Wilhelmshaven (19–31 August 1933), a communication course for cadets at Mürwik again (1–3 September 1933), and his first U-boat course at Mürwik (25 September – 1 October 1933).

On 2 October 1933, Kretschmer was transferred to the pocket battleship as a gunnery officer during a trip to Denmark. This stay was interrupted for an aerial defense training course at Warnemünde (5–10 March 1934). On 19 March 1934, his stay on &quot;Deutschland&quot; ended and he was transferred to the light cruiser (20 March – 26 September 1934). Kretschmer was present for gunnery exercises in the North and Baltic Sea. At Eckernförde on the 25/26 July 1934 Hitler boarded the ship to observe the exercise. During this assignment, Kretschmer was promoted to &quot;Oberfähnrich zur See&quot; (Senior Ensign) on 1 April 1934. During another torpedo training course at Flensburg-Mürwik (27 September – 21 December 1934), Kretschmer received his commission as &quot;Leutnant zur See&quot; on 1 October 1934. On 22 December 1934, Kretschmer was again on &quot;Köln&quot; serving as the ship&#x27;s second torpedo officer.

===&quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;===
In 1933 Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party came to power. The establishment of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; (Nazi German Armed Forces) in 1935 divided the major branches of the armed forces. The &quot;Reichsmarine&quot; was renamed the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;, a Nazi creation. The OKM was established as the supreme command of the navy responsible for all facets of naval warfare. The renaming of the navy was a symbolic gesture, to erase the unpleasant memories of the 1920s and symbolise a new era. According to one historian, Kretschmer was a patriot and loyal to the government, but later &quot;eschewed Nazi efforts to glorify his success through propaganda.&quot;

During Kretschmer&#x27;s stay on &quot;Köln&quot;, he attended an aircraft catapult course at Travemünde. On 26 September 1935, he was transferred to the 1st department of the standing ship division of the North Sea in Wilhelmshaven where he served as a company officer until 25 January 1936. Kretschmer joined the U-boat service in January 1936. After the completion of his submariner training he was promoted to &quot;Oberleutnant zur See&quot; (senior-sub lieutenant/Lieutenant Junior Grade) on 1 June 1936. Kretschmer&#x27;s first operational experience on a submarine was as a lieutenant on the in 1937 as first watch officer under the command of Klaus Ewerth and then Hans-Rudolf Rösing. Rösing brought his own watch officer, and Kretschmer was demoted to second watch officer. While Kretschmer was discharging his responsibilities for the operational readiness of the deck gun, Rösing dived the ship, leaving Kretschmer stranded in the freezing water. He clung to the periscope in the hope of being seen through the optics. Kretschmer was soon missed and the U-boat surfaced to find him before he succumbed to the cold.

He was given interim command of &quot;U-35&quot; in August 1937, and this appointment coincided with Germany&#x27;s involvement in the Spanish Civil War. The boat was ordered to patrol the Bay of Biscay off the Spanish-French border. The crew were permitted ashore at the resort town of San Sebastián. Rösing&#x27;s successor, Hermann Michahelles, was killed in a car accident and Kretschmer assumed command for two weeks. &quot;U-35&quot; returned to Germany after an uneventful patrol during which no ships were sunk. On 1 October 1937, Kretschmer took command of . Through the remaining Interwar period, Kretschmer developed his own approach to combat, which can be summarized by the phrase &quot;one torpedo, one ship&quot;. He dispensed with the standard practice of firing salvoes of torpedoes from long distances. Kretschmer also favoured surfaced attacks as opposed to the recommended submerged engagement, listing 11 Points of Submarine Warfare: 

# Efficient lookouts are of prime importance
# It is essential not simply to spot the target, but to spot it in good time
# Lone ships should be attacked on the surface with gunfire in order to save expensive torpedoes
# Survivors should be assisted when possible
# Convoys should be attacked in daylight only if it is not feasible to wait for nightfall
# Attack at night from the dark side of the convoy, so that the target is silhouetted and the submarine is in shadow
# When there is little or no moonlight, attack from the windward side (to avoid a visible white bow-wave when motoring into the wind)
# Fire one torpedo per target, not fanned salvoes
# Fire at close range
# Once an attack is launched, do not submerge except in circumstances of dire necessity. Remember that on the surface it is easier for you to spot the enemy than for the enemy to spot you
# Dive only for two hours before dawn each day, to rest the crew, sweep with sound detection equipment, etc.; otherwise, remain on the surface

The &#x27;one torpedo, one ship&#x27; tactics implemented by Kretschmer resulted in a very effective usage of torpedoes, as each attack was designed to maximize the chances of a hit. In fact, out of 116 torpedoes fired in action, Kretschmer scored 74 hits (equivalent to a 69.8% success rate). The vast majority of Kretschmer&#x27;s attacks - at least 83 - were launched on the surface.

Kretschmer was promoted to &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; (captain lieutenant/lieutenant) on 1 June 1939.

==World War II==
===&quot;U-23&quot;: Patrols 1–8===
The German invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939 began the war in Europe. Karl Dönitz, Befehlshaber der Unterseeboote (BdU), ordered attacks on Allied shipping at sea, beginning the Battle of the Atlantic. The short range of the Type II submarine allowed for operations in the North Sea, but no further.
Kretschmer and &quot;U-23&quot; had departed from Wilhelmshaven on 25 August, one week before the start of World War II. His first patrol, with &quot;Oberleutnant zur See&quot; Adalbert Schnee as first watch officer, took &quot;U-23&quot; into the North Sea and along the coast of the Netherlands. The boat returned to Wilhelmshaven on 4 September. Further patrols took &quot;U-23&quot; around the British coast. The main area of operations were the seas and estuaries off East of England and Scotland, with mine-laying operations in the Baltic, to counter the Royal Navy Submarine Service at the end of 1939. A second patrol (9–21 September) yielded no success either. Kretschmer departed from Kiel for the third war patrol on 1 October. On 4 October 1939 he sank the coastal ship &quot;Glen Farg&quot; (). The small freighter was carrying pulp and Ferrochrome. Kretschmer waited for the crew to take to the lifeboats before destroying the ship with a torpedo. He returned to Kiel, rather than Wilhelmshaven, on 16 October. The next day, Kretschmer was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class ().

The fourth patrol (1–9 November) was unsuccessful. On his fifth patrol (5–15 December) he was ordered to explore the inner waters around the Orkney Islands and engage any remaining Home Fleet units that had departed from Scapa Flow in the aftermath of Günther Prien&#x27;s attack. Kretschmer targeted the Danish &quot;Scotia&quot;, a on 7 December. The ship was accompanied by three other vessels, but she was darkened and the black out aroused Kretschmer&#x27;s suspicions. 19 men were killed in the sinking; only two were saved. Following this patrol, he received the Iron Cross 1st Class () on 17 December.

&quot;U-23&quot; departed from Kiel on 8 January 1940 for its sixth war patrol and Schnee had been replaced by &quot;Oberleutnant zur See&quot; Hans-Dietrich von Tiesenhausen. The Norwegian &quot;Fredville&quot;, only was sunk on 11 January 1940 without warning. The single torpedo attack killed 11 men. Only five sailors survived. Kretschmer&#x27;s next success came in the Inganess Bay, Kirkwall, where he attacked and sank the Danish tanker &quot;Danmark&quot; on 12 January 1940 while she lay at anchor. There were no deaths among the crew. Kretschmer returned to Wilhelmshaven on 15 January. Three days later he departed for his seventh war patrol. Another neutral Scandinavian ship was sunk. The Norwegian &quot;Varild&quot; was sunk east of the Shetland Islands. The attack was conducted with no warning, and consequently all 15 crewmen died. &quot;U-23&quot; returned to port on 29 January. He departed from Wilhelmshaven for his eighth war patrol on 9 February.

On 18 February, Kretschmer sank the 1,300 ton British fleet destroyer off the Pentland Firth while she was escorting convoy HN 12 from Norway. The destroyer crew lifted the black-out curtains, making the attack easy. A single torpedo was fired, then Kretschmer ordered a u-turn and sped away on the surface; the destroyers neither sighted him nor detected him with ASDIC. Kretschmer sighted the British submarine soon afterwards, and fired a second torpedo which missed. &quot;Thistle&quot; was sunk weeks later by &quot;U-4&quot;. 157 of the &quot;Daring&quot; crew were killed, including Commander Sydney Cooper. Only five survived. The next day, he sank , , in the Moray Firth. All 33 men aboard died. &quot;Loch Maddy&quot;
, , was sunk on 22 February. The ship had been torpedoed by &quot;U-57&quot; and abandoned. Kretschmer returned to Wilhelmshaven on 25 February after 17 days at sea—his longest to date.

===&quot;U-99&quot;: Battle of the Atlantic===

On 2 April 1940, after eight patrols on &quot;U-23&quot;, Kretschmer was ordered to the Germaniawerft, the shipbuilding works in Kiel, for construction training of the new Type VIIB . He commissioned &quot;U-99&quot; on 18 April 1940 which was part of the 7th U-boat Flotilla. After two months&#x27; training and shakedown manoeuvres in German waters, Kretschmer took the boat into action on 18 June 1940. On 21 June, his ninth patrol, his boat was damaged by an Arado Ar 196 floatplane from in the belief &quot;U-99&quot; was a British submarine. &quot;U-99&quot;″s first patrol ended in Wilhelmshaven on 25 June.
During &quot;U-99&quot;″s first four patrols, Kretschmer commenced attacking convoys at night on the surface, sinking merchant ships with highly accurate shots, using only one torpedo per target ship; the quote &quot;one torpedo ... one ship&quot; is attributed to Kretschmer around this time. His particularly brazen and risky innovation was to execute these night surface attacks inside the convoy. Admiral Sir George Creasy considered the manoeuvre so dangerous he thought it had been done by mistake. Kretschmer&#x27;s tenth patrol (27 June–21 July) yielded over . After sinking &quot;Magog&quot;—the submarine&#x27;s first victim—Kretschmer gave the crew a bottle of brandy and directions to Ireland. Acts of compassion in submarine warfare were &quot;selective and fickle&quot;, one historian wrote when describing Kretschmer&#x27;s rescue of a lone man in a raft. Haunted by him, Kretschmer ordered the boat to backtrack until the survivor was found. They provided clothes and alcohol, then transferred him to a lifeboat at the first opportunity.

Among the victims was the Estonian ship, &quot;Merisaar&quot;, . Kretschmer captured the vessel, the only such ship seized by &quot;U-99&quot;. The crew abandoned ship and were questioned by Kretschmer. The German crew failed to sink the stationary vessel with torpedoes while the weather ruled out the use of the gun. A prize crew boarded to sail it to Bordeaux. The ship did not reach port. German aircraft bombed and sank it three days later. Kretschmer docked in Lorient on 21 July. The BdU acquired new bases along the French Atlantic coast after the Battle of France. A notable failure on the patrol occurred in the interception of HMS &quot;Manistee&quot;. Kretschmer attempted to sink the ship with gunfire, but return fire and the appearance of an aircraft forced him to submerge. Under water &quot;U-99&quot; had no chance of catching her.

Four days later Kretschmer began his eleventh patrol which concluded on 5 August. This third patrol on &quot;U-99&quot;, took the boat into the North Atlantic, into the North Channel and west of Ireland. He sank four ships and damaged three. His greatest success was the sinking of &quot;Auckland Star&quot;, a ship on 28 July followed by another two totalling on 29 and 31 July. Kretschmer was guided onto convoy OB-191. The 28-ship convoy was poorly defended by a destroyer and a corvette. Kretschmer was presented with an opportunity to put his &quot;one torpedo, one ship&quot; mantra into practice. Kretschmer hit and sank the cargo ship &quot;Jersey City&quot; northwest of Tory Island while damaging three others, including the &quot;Strinda&quot;. The ships used barrels for ballast to prevent them sinking. The crew remained in lifeboats nearby for reboarding once the attack was over. Following his third war patrol with &quot;U-99&quot;, Kretschmer was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross () on 4 August. The presentation was made by &quot;Großadmiral&quot; Erich Raeder following his return to Lorient.

On &quot;U-99&quot;″s fourth war patrol in September 1940, Kretschmer formed part of a wolfpack that struck against Convoy HX 72. The convoy suffered heavy losses while the U-boats escaped unscathed. Kretschmer sank one and damaged two–which he and Prien dispatched the following day. Joachim Schepke arrived in &quot;U-100&quot; and sank seven. Heinrich Bleichrodt hit and sank two. 12 ships were sunk in total. Kretschmer&#x27;s logbook recorded the chaos. It noted that the destroyers &quot;did not know how to help&quot; and busied themselves firing star shells on a moonlit night. The following month, Kretschmer formed part of the pack that attacked and devastated Convoy SC 7. Bleichrodt reported it and Dönitz succeeded in bringing a number of boats in on it. Kretschmer sank six and disabled a seventh. Kretschmer recommended his helmsman &quot;Stabsobersteuermann&quot; Heinrich Petersen for the Knight&#x27;s Cross after twelve war patrols for saving &quot;U-99&quot; from enemy detection. The nomination was approved on 5 November 1940. Petersen had served as Kretschmer&#x27;s helmsman on every war patrol on both &quot;U-23&quot; and &quot;U-99&quot;.

In November and December 1940 &quot;U-99&quot; sank three British armed merchant cruisers (AMC), HMS &quot;Laurentic&quot;, HMS &quot;Patroclus&quot; and . &quot;Laurentic&quot; and &quot;Patroclus&quot; were attacked on the night of 3/4 November. 51 men died aboard &quot;Laurentic&quot;, 367 survived. &quot;Patroclus&quot; lost 56 crew; 230 survived. Kretschmer was awarded the 6th Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves () on 4 November 1940. &quot;U-99&quot; docked four days later, concluding Kretschmer&#x27;s fourteenth patrol after just ten days at sea. Upon reaching port, he was summoned to Berlin to meet Raeder. He was given the opportunity to convey his opinions on the state of the U-boat war. Kretschmer purportedly confined his remarks to the lack of air support from the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, a point Raeder was fully aware of. Kretschmer then met Hitler at the Reich Chancellery and he repeated his opinions on the war situation. Hitler invited Kretschmer to sit in on a lunch meeting with Hitler and Vyacheslav Molotov, the Soviet Union&#x27;s ambassador to the Third Reich. Kretschmer&#x27;s thoughts on Hitler and the subsequent conference are not known.

Kretschmer departed for his fifteenth patrol on 27 November and returned on 12 December. In December Kretschmer tried to intercept Convoy HX 90 but encountered only stragglers. &quot;Forfar&quot; was one, and during the sinking &quot;HMS Viscount&quot; appeared, forcing Kretschmer to dive. He assumed most of the crew went down with the ship; but there were 159 survivors. 176 men died. &quot;Laurentic&quot; and &quot;Patroclus&quot; had been loaded with wooden barrels to increase buoyancy. It took nine torpedoes and one dud to sink them; the latter was sunk after it stopped to pick up survivors from the former. Kretschmer was forced to engage &quot;Patroclus&quot; with the deck gun when it appeared to resist the torpedo damage, but retreated when the ship fired back. A Short Sunderland appeared briefly, and Kretschmer was forced to accomplish the destruction of the ship with torpedoes, submerged. On 7 December 1940, Kretschmer sank the Dutch freighter &quot;Farmsum&quot;; the last success of the year. The ship was loaded with coal, set for Buenos Aires, Argentina. The ship sank slowly. Kretschmer learned its identity from frantic radio signals.

===Defeat and capture===
Several of Kretschmer&#x27;s senior officers left the boat before the final patrol. Klaus Bargsten served aboard &quot;U-99&quot; under Kretschmer, before being promoted to captain himself and becoming the sole survivor of on 2 June 1942.

On 22 February 1941 &quot;U-99&quot; left Lorient for the final time. For 13 days Kretschmer sailed without success. &quot;U-99&quot; tried in vain to assist Prien in &quot;U-47&quot;, against OB 290. Prien achieved several sinkings, Kretschmer did not; the pair was chased off by destroyers. Prien&#x27;s reports were picked up by the Luftwaffe which sent Focke-Wulf Fw 200s from I. &quot;Gruppe&quot; of &quot;Kampfgeschwader&quot; 40 (KG 40—40th Bomber Wing) to attack the convoy. The air crews sank eight and damaged several more. Kretschmer continued to search for stragglers and found &quot;SS Holmlea&quot;. He fired a single torpedo that missed before he lost the ship in thick mist. Prien sank the ship the following day. Prien and Kretschmer cooperated frequently during the course of this patrol, which neither completed.

The operation against Convoy OB 293 proved disastrous for the Lorient group. Prien and Kretschmer, along with (Matz) and , attacked the convoy. The ships were protected by an escort group of two destroyers, and , and two corvettes, and . As with the group that eventually sank Kretschmer ten days later, they were experienced and competent. Kretschmer attempted a surface night attack using his favourite tactic. On 7 March Kretschmer sank two ships from the convoy including the &quot;Terje Viken&quot;. Four ships were sunk, but two U-boats were sunk, one of which was &quot;U-47&quot;. Prien along with his crew disappeared, presumably in a depth charge attack. British reports of the action mention a large red glow appearing deep below the surface amid the depth charge explosions.

On 16 March 1941 Kretschmer attacked Convoy HX 112. Kretschmer sank all but one of the ships lost by the convoy. During a counterattack by the escorts &quot;U-99&quot; was disabled after repeated depth charge attacks by the destroyers and . &quot;U-99&quot; was driven down to 700 feet—beyond the recognised crush depth— before control was regained and the ballast tanks blown. Kretschmer surfaced and, under fire from the British vessels, scuttled his boat. Three of his men were lost, but Kretschmer and the remainder of &quot;U-99&quot;″s crew were captured. That same day the British escorts scored another success against the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; when the noted U-boat skipper Joachim Schepke was killed aboard , having been depth charged, rammed and sunk by &quot;Vanoc&quot;.

Kretschmer&#x27;s usual standards of conduct were evident during the sinking of his boat. One signalman sent a message to the escorts &quot;we are sinking&quot; and the firing stopped. He then sent a message to BdU, &quot;Two destroyers—depth charges—50,000 tons—Kretschmer.&quot; Kretschmer signalled &quot;Walker&quot; asking for rescue for his men, taking care to ensure as many left the submarine as possible, and assisted some of his crew towards the rescue nets hung from the British destroyer. Kretschmer&#x27;s strength was evidently failing in the cold ocean; his own rescue was at the hands of a British sailor who climbed down the nets and plucked him from the water.

===Prisoner of war===
Kretschmer and his crew were landed in Liverpool. They were sent to Lime Street Station to be transported to London for interrogation. Kretschmer was taken separately, but his crew had to negotiate the streets of Liverpool and were subjected to missiles thrown by angry civilians; the city had been heavily bombed and was closely linked with the Atlantic war. He was transported to the London Cage, a facility for MI19 to hold valuable enemy prisoners. The building was located at number 8 Kensington Palace Gardens. Winston Churchill disclosed the capture of Kretschmer to the House of Commons on 21 March. German radio acknowledged the capture and the death of Schepke. Prien&#x27;s demise was not disclosed. German propagandists feared the triple loss might be too damaging to morale.

Once in London, Royal Navy interrogators questioned the crew. The report, filed in the archives, was named &quot;U 99&quot; Interrogation of Survivors April, 1941&quot;. The British report noted of Kretschmer, &quot;His political views were less extremely Nazi than had been assumed.  On seeing the craters of a stick of bombs near Buckingham Palace he was genuinely shocked that an attempt had so obviously been made by his countrymen to bomb the Palace. He spoke English quite well, though he lacked practice. His whole demeanour was calm and quiet, and he seemed anxious to be friendly; he was also less suspicious of British Officers than was his First Lieutenant. Kretschmer stated that he was unmarried.&quot;

Of his personality and view of the war it stated, &quot;He gave the impression of being a quiet, deliberate man, and looked more like a student than a U-Boat Captain. He prided himself on being able to take advantage of whatever the passing moment offered and made no elaborate plans for attacking convoys. He admitted that he had become weary of the war some time ago, and latterly had got no satisfaction from sinking ship after ship.&quot;

Following his capture, Kretschmer spent almost seven years as a prisoner of war (POW) in the hands of the British, initially at No 1 POW camp Grizedale Hall in Cumbria. In March 1942, the prisoners were transported to Bowmanville Camp near Lake Ontario in Canada. During his captivity, Kretschmer was promoted in rank to &quot;Korvettenkapitän&quot; (Lieutenant-Commander) on 19 March 1941, effective as of 1 March 1941, and to &quot;Fregattenkapitän&quot; (Commander) on 1 September 1944. In addition, he was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords () on 26 December 1941. He was the fifth member of the German armed forces to be so honored.

On 27 August 1941, &quot;U-570&quot; was captured by the Royal Navy. The officers were also taken to the prisoner-of-war camp at Grizedale Hall. Kretschmer was senior officer at the camp. An illegal &quot;Court of Honour&quot; was convened and headed by Kretschmer. They tried commander Hans-Joachim Rahmlow, &quot;in absentia&quot;, and &quot;U-570&quot;″s other officers. Rahmlow and his second-in-command, Bernhard Berndt, were found &quot;guilty of cowardice&quot;; the other two officers were &quot;acquitted&quot;. On the night of 18/19 October, Berndt escaped from the camp. A detachment of the Home Guard apprehended him, shooting him when he tried to escape. Allied courts and Rahmlow sought justice against Kretschmer after the war, but he was never vigorously pursued for trial for his role in the death of Berndt. Kretschmer was also involved in a second illegal court of honour hearing against the commander of . Its commander, Hugo Förster, was repatriated to Germany and committed suicide before the end of the war.

In 1943, the German navy tried to rescue him in Operation Kiebitz but that daring plan (later dramatized in the novel &quot;The Bowmanville Break&quot; and the film, &quot;The McKenzie Break&quot;) failed. Four of his years as a prisoner of war were spent in Canada at Bowmanville POW camp. Kretschmer was released from captivity on 31 December 1947, and returned to Germany.

==Postwar career, and later life==
In 1955, Donald McIntyre returned Kretschmer&#x27;s binoculars, which he had kept in 1941. McIntyre was the commanding officer of &quot;Walker&quot;, one of the ships that was involved in the sinking of &quot;U-99&quot;. At the time, Kretschmer was president of the &quot;Deutscher Marinebund&quot;, a member club of the International Maritime Confederation.
On 1 December 1955, Kretschmer joined West Germany&#x27;s navy, at the time named the &quot;Bundesmarine&quot; (Federal Navy), holding the rank of &quot;Fregattenkapitän&quot; (Commander). He participated in the second officers&#x27; training course held at the former NS-&quot;Ordensburg&quot; Sonthofen. There, he became inspection group leader at the acceptance organization. On 16 June 1956, he was tasked with the creation of 1. &quot;Geleitgeschwader&quot; (1st Escort Squadron) which he commanded from 3 January to 15 October 1957. He then attended a training course (16 October 1957 – 28 February 1958) for amphibious forces in the United States.

From 1 March to 31 October 1958, Kretschmer served as &quot;Admiralstabsoffizier&quot; (Asto—officer of the admiralty staff) with the Fleet Command. On 1 November 1958, he was transferred to the position of commander of the &quot;Bundesmarine&quot;″s &quot;Amphibische Streitkräfte&quot; (&quot;amphibious forces&quot;), a position he held until 15 January 1962. During this command, he was promoted to &quot;Kapitän zur See&quot; (captain at sea/captain) on 12 December 1958. On 16 January 1962, Kretschmer was appointed head of the department for naval task force training and naval tactics with the &quot;Führungsstab der Marine&quot; (Navy Staff) with the Federal Ministry of Defence. On 28 August 1963, he was transferred to the NATO Defense College in Paris. Kretschmer served in this function until 18 June 1964 when he was appointed chief-of-staff of the &quot;Befehlshaber der Seestreitkräfte der Nordsee&quot; (German national Commander Naval Forces North Sea). On 1 June 1965, he was promoted to &quot;Flottillenadmiral&quot; (flotilla admiral/Commodore/Rear Admiral), a rank which he initially held on probation. That day, he was made chief-of-staff of the NATO command COMNAVBALTAP at Kiel, taking command on 15 June. Six months later, on 15 December, he officially became &quot;Flottillenadmiral&quot;. His command ended on 31 March 1969. The next day, Kretschmer was transferred to the &quot;Amt für Militärkunde&quot; (Department of Military Studies), retiring on 30 September 1970.

While on holiday in Bavaria in the summer of 1998, Kretschmer died in an accident during a boating expedition on the Danube to celebrate his 50th wedding anniversary, at the age of 86. He was on a holiday cruise from Regensburg to Budapest when he tried climbing some almost vertical steps. A fall caused fatal head injuries. He died on 5 August 1998 at a hospital in Straubing. His body was cremated, and following a funeral ceremony at Hinte, his ashes were scattered at sea.

==Summary of military career==
According to Dixon, Kretschmer sank 47 ships of , further damaging three ships of . Stockert lists him with 46 ships sunk, totaling , and damaging five ships of . Busch and Röll state that he sunk 47 ships of plus five ships damaged of .

<text>The third USS &quot;Delaware&quot; of the United States Navy was a 74-gun ship of the line, named for the state of Delaware.

She was laid down at Norfolk Navy Yard in August 1817 and launched on 21 October 1820. She was roofed over and kept at the yard in ordinary until on 27 March 1827, when she was ordered repaired and fitted for sea.

&quot;Delaware&quot; put to sea on 10 February 1828 under the command of Captain J. Downs to become the flagship of Commodore W. M. Crane in the Mediterranean. Arriving at Algeciras Bay, Spain on 23 March, she served in the interests of American commerce and diplomacy in that area until returning to Norfolk on 2 January 1830. According to Ned Myers, who shipped on her maiden voyage, &quot;...it required some little time to get her trim and sailing. She turned out, however, to be a good vessel; sailing fairly, steering well, and proving to be an excellent sea-boat.&quot;

&quot;Delaware&quot; was decommissioned on 10 February, and lay in ordinary at Norfolk until 1833. Recommissioned on 15 July 1833, she received President Andrew Jackson aboard on 29 July, firing a 24-gun salute at both his arrival and departure. The following day she set sail for the Mediterranean where she served as flagship for Commodore D. T. Patterson and cruised on goodwill visits and for the protection of the rights and property of American citizens until her return to Hampton Roads on 16 February 1836. She was placed in ordinary from 10 March 1836 until recommissioned on 7 May 1841 for local operations from Norfolk.

&quot;Delaware&quot; sailed on 1 November for a tour of duty on the Brazil Station as flagship for Commodore Charles Morris. She patrolled the coasts of Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina to represent American interests during political unrest in those countries. On 19 February 1843, she sailed from Rio de Janeiro for another cruise in the Mediterranean. &quot;Delaware&quot; returned to Hampton Roads on 4 March 1844 and was decommissioned at Norfolk Navy Yard on the 22nd. Still in ordinary there in 1861, she was burned on 20 April along with other ships and the yard facilities to prevent their falling into Confederate hands.

<text>The New Flemish Alliance ( ; N-VA) is a Flemish nationalist, conservative political party in Belgium. The party was established in 2001 by the right-leaning faction of the centrist-nationalist People&#x27;s Union (VU).

The N-VA is a regionalist and confederalist movement that self-identifies with the promotion of civic nationalism. Within the Flemish Movement, the party strives for the peaceful and gradual transformation of Belgium into a confederal country. In recent years it has become the largest party of Flanders as well as of Belgium as a whole, and it participated in the 2014–18 Belgian Government until 9 December 2018. On february 3th 2025 former N-VA Chairman and Mayor of Antwerp, Bart De Wever, became the prime minister of Belgium. Former Flemish prime minister Jan Jambon became vice prime minister in the De Wever Government.

The N-VA was established as a centre-right party with the main objective of working towards furthering Flemish autonomy and redefining Belgium as a confederal country through gradually obtaining more powers for both Belgian communities separately with the belief that this will pave the way for eventual Flemish independence. During its early years, the N-VA mostly followed the platform of the former VU by characterising itself as a big tent party with Flemish nationalism as its central theme. Furthermore, it emphasized a pragmatic and non-revolutionary image (as opposed to the far-right character of the other main Flemish pro-separatist party Vlaams Belang) in order to legitimise increased Flemish autonomy. The party also espoused non-interventionalist and pro-individual freedom messages in its original platform. In subsequent years, the N-VA moved to the right and adopted a distinctly conservative identity under the leadership of Bart De Wever, who succeeded the founding leader Geert Bourgeois. The party used to be pro-Europeanist, and previously advocated deepening ties with the European Union (EU) which the N-VA regarded as an important means to give Flanders more international influence, but has since shifted to a &quot;Eurorealist&quot; or &quot;Eurocritical&quot; stance by calling for democratic reform of the EU and opposing a Federal Superstate. The party is known for its insistence on the exclusive use of Dutch, Flanders&#x27; sole official language, in dealings with government agencies. The N-VA advocates economic liberalism and immediate tax reductions to stimulate the economy. It also supports stricter law and order and controlled immigration policies, with stronger measures to integrate immigrants in Flanders.

A leading member of the European Free Alliance (EFA), since the 2014 European Parliament election, the N-VA has sat with the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) parliamentary group in the European Parliament.

The party announced the creation of a Walloon branch in 2024, although it didn&#x27;t manage to win any seats in the Belgian elections of that same year.

==History==
===Fall of the People&#x27;s Union===

The N-VA stems from the right-leaning faction of the People&#x27;s Union (, VU), a Belgian political party and broad electoral alliance of Flemish nationalists from both sides of the political spectrum with the N-VA&#x27;s founders largely encompassing the more centre-right and pro-independence wing of the VU.

Towards the end of the 20th century, with a steadily declining electorate and the majority of the party&#x27;s federalist agenda implemented, friction between several wings of the People&#x27;s Union emerged. In the beginning of the 1990s, Bert Anciaux became party president and led the party in an ever more progressive direction, combining the social-liberal and social democratic ideas of his iD21-movement with the regionalist course of the People&#x27;s Union. These experiments were opposed by the more traditional right-wing party base. Many of the VU&#x27;s more ardent national-conservative members defected to the Vlaams Blok after becoming disgruntled with direction of the party, prompting a further decline in support. Around this time, VU member Geert Bourgeois, de facto leader of the VU&#x27;s traditionalist and centre-right nationalist wing, put together the so-called &quot;Oranjehofgroep&quot; (which would go on to become the bedrock of the N-VA) which included fellow VU members Frieda Brepoels, Eric Defoort, Ben Weyts and Bart De Wever. The Oranjehofgroep opposed the direction in which the party was being taken by Anciaux and wanted the VU to pursue a more conservative, Flemish nationalist and separatist direction, while the wing helmed by Anciaux was looking to merge the Volksunie with its progressive programme with another political party.

Tension rose towards the end of the decade, as Geert Bourgeois was elected chairman by party members, in preference to the incumbent and progressive Patrik Vankrunkelsven who belonged to the iD21 wing. Factions subsequently clashed multiple times, over the future course of the party and possible support for current state reform negotiations. On 13 October 2001, the party openly split into three factions: the progressive wing around Bert Anciaux, which would later become the Spirit party; the conservative nationalist wing around Geert Bourgeois; and a centrist group opposing the imminent split. An internal referendum was held on the future course of the party. The right wing gained a substantial plurality of 47% and inherited the party infrastructure. Since no faction got an absolute majority, however, the name &quot;Volksunie&quot; could no longer be used under Belgian constitutional law and the VU was dissolved. The centre-right orientated faction of the VU went on to found the N-VA while the remaining centre-left faction reorganized itself as Spirit and the centrist-liberal wing mostly folded into the Open VLD.

===Foundation and the election threshold===
In the autumn of 2001, the New Flemish Alliance (, N-VA) was officially registered. Seven members of parliament from the People&#x27;s Union joined the new party. The new party council created a party manifesto and a statement of principles. The first party congress was held in May 2002, voting on a party program and permanent party structures. Geert Bourgeois was elected chairman. The N-VA initially continued some of the VU&#x27;s former policies.

The party participated in elections for the first time in the 2003 federal elections, but struggled with the election threshold of 5%. This threshold was only reached in West Flanders, the constituency of Geert Bourgeois. With only one federal representative and no senator, the party lost government funding and faced irrelevance.

===Cartel with CD&amp;V===
In February 2004, the N-VA entered into an electoral alliance, commonly known in Belgium as a cartel, with the Christian Democratic and Flemish (CD&amp;V) party, the traditionally largest party, which was then in opposition. They joined forces in the regional elections in 2004 and won. Both parties joined the new Flemish government, led by CD&amp;V leader Yves Leterme. Geert Bourgeois became a minister, and Bart De Wever became the new party leader in October 2004.

The cartel was briefly broken when the former right-wing liberal Jean-Marie Dedecker left the Open Flemish Liberals and Democrats (Open VLD) and entered the N-VA on behalf of the party executive. However, the party congress did not put Dedecker on the election list, instead preferring to continue the cartel with CD&amp;V, who had strongly opposed placing him on a joint cartel list. Dedecker saw this as a vote of no confidence, and left the party after only 10 days, to form his own party, List Dedecker (LDD). Deputy leader Brepoels, who supported Dedecker, stepped down from the party board afterwards.

In the Belgian federal election of 2007, the CD&amp;V/N-VA cartel won a major victory again, with a campaign focusing on good governance, state reform and the division of the electoral district Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde. The N-VA won five seats in the Chamber of Representatives and two seats in the Senate. Yves Leterme initiated coalition talks, which repeatedly stalled (see 2007–2008 Belgian government formation). On 20 March 2008, a new federal government was finally assembled. N-VA did not join this government, but gave its support pending state reform.

The cartel ended definitively on 24 September 2008, due to lack of progression in state reform matters and a different strategy on future negotiations. N-VA left the Flemish Government and gave up its support of Leterme at the federal level.

===Mainstream party===
In the regional elections of June 2009, N-VA won an unexpected 13% of the votes, making them the winner of the elections, along with their old cartel partner CD&amp;V. N-VA subsequently joined the government, led by Kris Peeters (CD&amp;V). Bart De Wever chose to remain party leader and appointed Geert Bourgeois and Philippe Muyters as ministers in the Flemish Government and Jan Peumans as speaker of the Flemish Parliament.

Ahead of the 2010 Belgian federal election, all of the other Belgian parties distanced themselves from the N-VA resulting in De Wever accusing the Belgian political establishment of plotting a new cordon sanitaire against his party. In its election program, the N-VA advocated confederalism for Belgium maximum authority and responsibility for the different regions of the country, whereby the Flemish and Walloon regions and communities are rewarded for good policies and punished for bad policies. The party also campaigned for revisions to Belgium&#x27;s finance laws and reforms to the health and education systems. De Wever also called on all the Flemish parties to work together to push for confederalism and campaigned for the idea that no government formation in Belgium should exclude a Flemish majority. 

The N-VA made a major breakthrough and won the elections with just under 28% of the Flemish votes in the Chamber (31% in the Senate), making it the largest party in Flanders and Belgium. The party acquired 27 seats in the Chamber. As a result, N-VA became the dominant political formation in the Flemish political landscape and took the place that CD&amp;V had occupied for decades as the largest Flemish party. After the election, some media commentators attributed the party&#x27;s result to the style of De Wever while others argued the N-VA was able to win over conservative and Flemish nationalist supporters of the Vlaams Belang who had supported the VB out of necessity as the main Flemish separatist party but regarded it as extreme by offering a moderate alternative, as well as voters of the Open VLD and CD&amp;V who felt those parties had moved to the left and had not performed well in government.

The N-VA also performed strongly during the 2012 Belgian local elections but was criticized by political opponents for featuring former Vlaams Belang and Vlaams Blok politicians such as Jurgen Ceder and Karim Van Overmeire on their local lists. De Wever responded by stating that only a small number of VB politicians were running as N-VA candidates. The N-VA emerged as the largest party in Antwerp with De Wever being elected as mayor.

=== Michel I government ===
During the 2014 Belgian federal election, the N-VA again emerged as the largest party in both Flanders and Belgium as a whole. In the aftermath of the election, King Philippe nominated De Wever as &quot;informateur&quot; tasking him with forming a government.

After five months of discussions, a coalition between CD&amp;V, Open Vld, MR and N-VA was formed on 7 October 2014, with Walloon MR politician Charles Michel appointed as Prime Minister of Belgium.

In December 2018, a political crisis emerged over whether to sign the Global Compact for Migration; N-VA was against this, whereas the other three parties in the federal government supported it. On 4 December 2018, Charles Michel announced that the issue would be taken to parliament for a vote. On 5 December, parliament voted 106 to 36 in favor of backing the agreement. Michel stated that he would endorse the pact on behalf of parliament, not on behalf of the divided government. Consequently, N-VA quit the federal government; the other three parties continued as a minority government (Michel II).

===2019 to 2025===

During the 2019 federal elections, the party again polled in first place in the Flemish region. However, it also saw a decline in vote share for the first time, falling to 25.6% of the Flemish vote with commentators arguing this was due to a revival of the Vlaams Belang.

Ahead of the 2024 federal elections, the N-VA announced it would run candidates in Wallonia for the first time. The party did not see any candidates elected in French-speaking districts, but it remained in first place in the Flemish region in the Federal Parliament despite polls indicating it would be overtaken by Vlaams Belang while it finished joint-first with the VB in the Flemish Parliament.

===2025 to present===
Early 2025, Bart De Wever became Belgian Prime Minister, after which Steven Vandeput was appointed as interim president until the next party elections.

==Foundation and ideology==
The New Flemish Alliance is a relatively young political party, founded in the autumn of 2001. Being one of the successors of the People&#x27;s Union (Volksunie) party which existed from 1954–2001, it is, however, based on an established political tradition. The N-VA works towards the same goal as its Volksunie predecessor: to redefine Flemish nationalism in a contemporary setting. The N-VA&#x27;s leader Bart De Wever calls himself a conservative and a nationalist. In its early years, the N-VA argued for a Flemish Republic as a member state of a democratic European confederation. In its initial mission statement, the party stated that the challenges of the 21st century can best be answered by strong communities and by well-developed international co-operation, a position which reflected in their tagline: &quot;Necessary in Flanders, useful in Europe.&quot; (.)

Presently, the N-VA is generally characterised by political scientists and journalists as conservative, conservative liberal, and economically liberal and positioned towards the right-wing of the political spectrum with Flemish nationalism linked to the core of its policy ideas and messages. The N-VA initially advocated deepening ties with the European Union but in recent years it has been defined as moderately eurosceptic and growing more EU-critical.

During the N-VA&#x27;s early years, a label for the political orientation for the party was difficult to find. Although the N-VA articulated its ideology as centre-right, it also borrowed from its Volksunie predecessor by presenting itself as a big tent or a catch-all party and a socially liberal nationalist movement that combined left- and right-wing policies but focused on Flemish issues above all else. The N-VA also summed up its initial platform with the motto &quot;Evolution, not Revolution,&quot; arguing for a more pragmatic and less radical approach to Flemish nationalism. The N-VA first argued that a Flemish nationalist party was needed in the Belgian Federal Parliament both to represent the Flemish people and to work with politicians from all Belgian communities to redefine Belgium as a confederal rather than a federal state by securing more autonomy and political powers for both the Flemish and Walloon regions of Belgium. This strategy assumed that through successive transfers of powers from the federal level to both regions on the one hand, and the European Union on the other, the Belgian state will gradually become obsolete. 

In its 2009 election programme, the N-VA described itself as economically liberal and ecologically green. The party supported public transport, open source software, renewable energy and taxing cars by the number of kilometres driven. It wanted more aid for developing countries and more compulsory measures to require that immigrants learn Dutch. The party has generally been supportive of LGBT rights and backed same-sex marriage in Belgium. It calls for measures to protect weaker members of society but also robust welfare reform and limits to welfare benefits to encourage people back into work and reduce unemployment. 

Within the decade of its founding, the N-VA has shifted from a big tent to a conservative party by basing some of its socio-economic policies on that of the British Conservative Party. Political scientist Glen Duerr has described the N-VA&#x27;s current position as evolving to somewhere between that of Vlaams Belang and CD&amp;V, defining itself as a small conservative party while rejecting radical populism. The N-VA has also been described as part of the &quot;sub-state nationalist&quot; family of parties similar to the Scottish National Party and the Catalan National Call for the Republic and Junts parties with its regionalist platform while also differing from other independence movements in this category like the SNP which tend to hold progressive social and economic agendas since the N-VA promotes more neoliberal policies and stances on immigration and multiculturalism that are more in common with right-leaning European parties. Belgian professor Ico Maly has described the N-VA&#x27;s current ideology as drawing on the intellectual beliefs of the party&#x27;s leader Bart de Wever which he terms as &quot;scientific nationalism&quot; that distances the N-VA from the more far-right nationalism advocated by the Vlaams Belang, but on the other, leads the N-VA to use more cultural arguments compared to parties like the SNP such as defending Western values and an ethnically defined Flemish identity.

Since 2014, the N-VA has been described as continuing to move ideologically further to the right under the influence of Bart De Wever and Theo Francken by adopting tougher stances on immigration, integration of minorities, requirements to obtain Belgian citizenship, law and order, national security and repatriation of foreign born criminals and illegal immigrants. In 2015, German weekly Die Zeit published a list of 39 successful radical political parties in Europe. The paper described N-VA as right-wing populist and separatist because it reduces complex political problems to territorial issues. N-VA responded that &quot;foreign media find the party difficult to place, so they just label us as extremists.&quot; Some commentators have attributed these shifts as a response to a revival in support for the Flemish nationalist Vlaams Belang. In contrast to other Belgian parties, the N-VA is more critical of the &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; placed on the Vlaams Belang party and recently has been more open to negotiating with the VB, although accepting former Vlaams Blok/Vlaams Belang members as defectors into the N-VA still remains controversial within some ranks of the party.

===Flemish nationalism===
The N-VA is part of the broader Flemish nationalist movement and describes its beliefs as combining civic and cultural nationalism. The party promotes what it calls inclusive nationalism not defined by revolutionary or racist sentiments in which newcomers can become part of the Flemish community through compulsory learning of the Dutch language, Flemish history and Western values. In its current mission statement, the party claims that political divides in Belgium are not a xenophobic conflict but due to the political structure, arguing that Belgium has effectively been divided into two separate democracies since the 20th Century. The N-VA believes the solution is to redefine the federal Belgian state as a confederal union by means of transferring powers separately to both communities with a smaller government in Brussels that handles core issues like defense and security, while the Flemish and Walloon regions are given more decision making abilities. The N-VA argues that Flanders should pursue more independent economic, taxation and foreign policies which it believes will lead to gradual Flemish secessionism. The party also supports a review into financial transfers from Flanders to Brussels and the Wallonia region, arguing that such a policy threatens solidarity between different linguistic groups and has been a burden on Flemish tax payers.

===Migration===
The party calls for more strict immigration policies and reforms to asylum laws on its platform, proritizing knowledge-based immigration similar to the Canadian model while significantly reducing unskilled immigration and including a compulsory &quot;integration contract&quot; for immigrants to learn Dutch and undergo a values and social skills test before receiving Belgian citizenship. The N-VA also argues that dual nationals should be stripped of their citizenship if they are convicted of terrorism and other serious crimes and for the removal of illegal immigrants. On asylum, the N-VA calls for a &quot;humane but strict asylum and migration policy&quot; giving more support for refugees closer to their home region while arguing that anyone who enters European territory illegally will automatically be denied asylum. The party also established a new government position of Minister for Integration in the Flemish Government after becoming the largest party in the Flemish Parliament. In Federal politics, N-VA MP Theo Francken who served as Belgium&#x27;s Secretary of State for Asylum and Migration sought to tighten laws on family migration and was noted for overseeing a record deportation of illegal immigrants and foreigners with criminal backgrounds. This policy made him the most popular politician in public opinion polls. The party is also critical of multiculturalism, arguing that it prevents inclusiveness and social cohesion among the population, and has accused French-speaking parties of pushing mass immigration and multicultural policies onto Flanders through Belgian state politics. In 2018, the party opposed the UN Global Compact for Migration and subsequently withdrew its participation in the Belgian government in protest of its passing. Some commentators have attributed these shifts as a response to a revival in support for the Flemish nationalist Vlaams Belang, which also campaigned against the Migration Compact. The N-VA also supports increased spending and resources for the police and border forces, as well as more resources for counter-terrorism and national security efforts.

===Climate change===
The party has a what it calls a &quot;ecorealism&quot; stance, arguing for constructive methods and the use of green technology and expanding Belgium&#x27;s nuclear power stations to mitigate climate change.

However, the N-VA voted at European level against the foundations of the European Green Deal, namely against an extension of the European Union Emissions Trading System to more sectors and against a European carbon border tax. At the Flemish level, the N-VA and the Flemish government are in favor of a 40% reduction in emissions by 2030, while the EU is calling for a 47% reduction, an objective for which Brussels and Wallonia do commit.

===Foreign policy===
In terms of foreign policy, the N-VA&#x27;s stance on the European Union began as strongly pro-European in character (which it regarded as an important means of gaining legitimacy for Flemish nationalism on an international stage); in 2010, the party called for &quot;an ever stronger and more united Europe.&quot; However, the party has since moved in a Eurocritical direction and takes an opposition stance towards EU integration by arguing EU member states should have the right to self-determination. The N-VA calls for less interference at national decision making levels and for the right for EU members to maintain their cultural identity, more democratic reform of the EU and rejecting a Federal EU Superstate, and arguing that economically unstable nations should leave the Eurozone. The party is critical of the EU&#x27;s stance on illegal immigration (in particular its handling of the migrant crisis) and the role played by NGOs in picking up migrants. The N-VA argues that the EU should emulate the Australian model of border protection to reinforce its external border and work with nations outside of Europe to stem the flow of illegal migrants arriving by sea.

The N-VA supports continued Belgian participation in NATO and for military cooperation between European states.

The party has supported sending military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and sent a delegation of members to meet with Ukrainian officials in 2022.

===Other policies===

On economic policy, the N-VA calls for reduced national debts and balanced budget in the Flemish and Federal Parliaments. It has generally advocated for free-market policies and limits on certain government spending. It also supports increased trade and business investment for Flanders.

The N-VA also supports abolishing the Belgian Senate.

==International affiliations==
At European level, the N-VA is part of the European Free Alliance (EFA), a European political party consisting of regionalist, pro-independence and minority interest political parties, of which the People&#x27;s Union was a founder member. Since the EFA tends to contain parties on the left, the N-VA stands out due to its more centre-right orientation. During the 7th European Parliament of 2009–2014, the N-VA was a member of The Greens–European Free Alliance (Greens/EFA) group in the European Parliament. However, following the 2014 European elections, the N-VA announced it was moving to a new group and chose the conservative and eurosceptic European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) over the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. Since 2014, the N-VA has served on the bureau for the ECR group and sits alongside the Czech Civic Democratic Party, the Sweden Democrats, Brothers of Italy, Poland&#x27;s Law &amp; Justice and formerly the British Conservative Party in the European Parliament.

The N-VA is a member of the International Democracy Union.

==Electorate==
In the federal elections in 2003, N-VA received 3.1% of the votes, but won only one seat in the federal parliament. In February 2004, they formed an electoral alliance (cartel) with the Christian Democratic and Flemish party (CD&amp;V). The cartel won the elections for the Flemish Parliament. The N-VA received a total of 6 seats. However, on 21 September 2008 the N-VA lost its faith in the federal government and the following day minister Geert Bourgeois resigned. In a press conference he confirmed the end of the CD&amp;V/N-VA cartel.

In the 2004 European elections, N-VA had one MEP elected as part of the cartel with CD&amp;V.

In the 10 June 2007 federal elections, the cartel won 30 out of 150 seats in the Chamber of Representatives and 9 out of 40 seats in the Senate.

In the regional elections of 11 June 2009, N-VA (now on its own after the split of the cartel with CD&amp;V) won an unexpected 13% of the votes, making them the winner of the elections along with their former cartel partner. In the 2009 European elections held on the same day, the N-VA had one MEP elected.

In the 2010 federal elections, N-VA became the largest party of Flanders and of Belgium altogether.

In the 2014 federal elections, N-VA increased their dominant position, taking votes and seats from the far-right Flemish Interest. In the simultaneous 2014 regional elections and 2014 European elections, the N-VA also became the largest party in the Flemish Parliament and in the Belgian delegation to the European Parliament.

In the 2019 federal elections, the party remained in first place in the Chamber of Representatives, European Parliament and Flemish Parliament, but saw a decline of their vote share for the first time, obtaining 16.03% of the votes in the Federal Parliament. With a decline of 24.7% of their votes compared to 2014, the N-VA suffered the biggest election defeat of any Flemish government party in the last fifty years. The decline in votes was in part due to a sudden upsurge in support for the Flemish Interest.

<text>Ecolo (), officially Écologistes Confédérés pour l&#x27;organisation de luttes originales (, ) is a French-speaking political party in Belgium based on green politics. The party is active in Wallonia, the Brussels-Capital Region, and the German-speaking Community of Belgium.

Ecolo&#x27;s Flemish equivalent is Groen; the two parties maintain close relations with each other.

==Name==
Ecolo is officially a backronym for &quot;Écologistes Confédérés pour l&#x27;organisation de luttes originales&quot; &quot;Confederated Ecologists for the Organisation of Original Struggles&quot;, but is really just short for &quot;écologistes&quot;, French for environmentalists.

==History==
Ecolo was part of the 1999 Verhofstadt I Government, but withdrew from the coalition before the 2003 general election, which saw it lose nearly two thirds of its 14 federal parliamentary seats in the face of a resurgent Socialist Party. The party made quite a comeback, however, in the 2007 general election, though failing to match the peak popularity it had enjoyed in 1999. In the general election of 10 June 2007, the party won eight out of 150 seats in the Chamber of Representatives and two out of the 40 directly elected seats in the Senate.

In the 2010 elections, the party again won eight seats in the Chamber of Representatives and two in the Senate.

==Political views==
Ecolo is a political party that promotes sustainable development policies, aimed at preserving the environment and combating climate change, in the interests of current and future generations. The party seeks to create a more democratic and inclusive society by encouraging new political practices and strengthening citizen participation in a model of participatory democracy.

<doc id="229969" wikidata="Q2711996" url="?curid=229969" title="Liberal Reformist Party (Belgium)">
<text>The Liberal Reformist Party (, , PRL) was a liberal political party active in Wallonia and Brussels in Belgium. The PRL grew out of the Francophone part of the unitary liberal Party for Freedom and Progress (PVV-PLP) in 1971 and merged into the Reformist Movement (RM) in 2002.

==History==
In 1971, the Party for Freedom and Progress (PVV-PLP), inheritor to the historical Liberal Party of Belgium, split into a Flemish and a Francophone party, anticipating the political devolution bill of 1980. Initially keeping the French version of the old party name (&quot;Parti de la liberté et du progrès&quot;), the party relaunched as the &quot;Party of Reforms and Freedom of Wallonia&quot; (Parti des réformes et de la liberté de Wallonie, PRLW) after taking over the Walloon Rally. In Brussels, the French-speaking Liberals co-operated intensively with the Democratic Front of the Francophones (FDF). In 1979, the Francophone liberals of the capital merged into the PRLW, which took the new name of Liberal Reformist Party (PRL).

The Walloon liberals participated in the federal government from 1973 to 1977 (Leburton governments I-II, Tindemans governments I-III), in 1980 (Martens government III), from 1981 to 1988 (Martens governments V-VII), and from 1999 to 2003 (Verhofstadt I Government).

In 1993, the PRL formed an alliance with the Democratic Front of the Francophones (FDF), a party standing up for the rights of French-speakers in and around Brussels. In 1998, the Citizens&#x27; Movement for Change, a split-off from the Christian Social Party, joined the alliance, making it the PRL-FDF-MCC Federation. On a congress in 2002, the German-speaking liberals of the Party for Freedom and Progress also joined and the alliance took the name of Reformist Movement (MR). After this congress, the PRL completely merged in the MR.

<text>Western Electric Co., Inc. was an American electrical engineering and manufacturing company that operated from 1869 to 1996. A subsidiary of the AT&amp;T Corporation for most of its lifespan, Western Electric was the primary manufacturer, supplier, and purchasing agent for all telephone equipment for the Bell System from 1881 until 1984, when the Bell System was dismantled. Because the Bell System had a near-total monopoly over telephone service in the United States for much of the 20th century, Western Electric&#x27;s equipment was widespread across the country. The company was responsible for many technological innovations, as well as developments in industrial management.

==History==
In 1856, George Shawk, a craftsman and telegraph maker, purchased an electrical engineering business in Cleveland, Ohio.

In January 1869, Shawk had partnered with Enos M. Barton in the former Western Union repair shop of Cleveland, to manufacture burglar alarms, fire alarms, and other electrical items. Both men were former Western Union employees. Shawk, was the Cleveland shop foreman and Barton, was a Rochester, New York telegrapher. During this Shawk and Barton partnership, one customer was an inventor sourcing parts and models for experiments. That inventor was Elisha Gray, a former physics professor at Oberlin College. Barton thought of future growth in electrical apparatus potential for the company and shared a common enthusiasm with the inventor, who was interested in leading a manufacturing plant capable of long-term developments. 

Shawk found those plans were beyond his business goals and offered to sell his half-interest partnership to Gray. Anson Stager, a former Chief of the U.S. Military Telegraphs during the American Civil War, advanced money for Gray to buy the half-interest and become a partner when Gray and Barton moved operations to Chicago. Gray and Barton previously knew Stager and an agreement was signed on November 18, 1869, to launch the company as Gray &amp; Barton. The firm was open for business by the end of the year in Chicago. In December 1869, the location was at 162 South Water Street in Chicago. 

On December 31, 1869, he entered a partnership with Barton, and later sold his share to inventor Gray. In 1872, Barton and Gray moved the business to Clinton Street, and incorporated it as the &quot;Western Electric Manufacturing Company&quot; on the Near West Side of Chicago. They manufactured a variety of electrical products including typewriters, alarms, and lighting and had a close relationship with telegraph company Western Union, to whom they supplied relays and other equipment.

In 1875, Gray sold his interests to Western Union, including the caveat that he had filed against Alexander Graham Bell&#x27;s patent application for the telephone. The ensuing legal battle between Western Union and the Bell Telephone Company over patent rights ended in 1879 with Western Union withdrawing from the telephone market and Bell acquiring Western Electric in 1881. This purchase was a crucial step in standardizing telephone instruments and concentrating manufacturing in a single entity.

In the company&#x27;s first few years as Western Electric, there were five manufacturing locations located at Chicago (220-232 Kinzie St.) New York, Boston, Indianapolis and Antwerp, Belgium. The locations were not permanent, as the headquarters in Chicago had moved to a new building on Clinton Street, the New York shop had moved two city blocks to a new building on Greenwich Street, and both Boston and Indianapolis factories closed. The Antwerp location was at the same location under Western Electric operations until sold in 1925 to ITT.

In April 1879, the New York shop was located at 62-68 New Church Street, Lower Manhattan, New York. Western Union had a factory at that location and the Western Electric company known as W.E. Mfg. Co., at the time, had purchased Western Union&#x27;s New York Factory to continue the increase of phone production. This site would also place the end to Western Union factories.

The Boston shop was located at 109-115 Court Street and it was previously known as the Charles Williams, Jr factory that was purchased by Western Electric in 1882. The consolidation of operations was done in 1884 to Chicago and New York factories by Charles Williams becoming a Western Electric Manager.

In 1888–1889, Western Electric built a 10-story factory building at 125 Greenwich Street in Lower Manhattan, to manufacture some of the first telephones. The New York shop that was renting the Western Union building moved to this building.
In preparation for the Chicago Worlds Fair of 1892, Western Electric was responsible for the organized Bell System sales activities and merchandising of apparatus for the 900 long-distance circuit from New York to Chicago. In 1897, the building at 463 West Street, New York was constructed and housed the New York shop as well as the company Eastern headquarters.
Western Electric was the first company to join in a Japanese joint venture with foreign capital. In 1899, it invested in a 54% share of the Nippon Electric Company, Ltd. Western Electric&#x27;s representative in Japan was Walter Tenney Carleton. The company, later known as NEC, would eventually become a major international manufacturer of electronics equipment including semiconductors and personal computers.

In 1901, Western Electric secretly purchased a controlling interest in a principal competitor, the Kellogg Switchboard &amp; Supply Company, but in 1909 was forced by a lawsuit to sell back to Milo Kellogg.

The Manufacturers Junction Railway Company was incorporated in January 1903 to provide rail connections to major railroad systems. There were approximately 13 miles of track in and out of Hawthorne Works for rail freight of inbound materials and outbound finished products. Western Electric had a tenure of 50 years up to 1952, in the responsibility and operation of its use for Hawthorne and other nearby industrial companies.

Also, in 1903, the construction of Hawthorne Works first buildings were authorized by Barton.

In 1907, the research and development staffs of Western Electric and AT&amp;T were consolidated to 463 West Street, New York. The location served the newly Western Electric Engineering Department for the responsibility of the testing and inspection of its telephones and equipment. AT&amp;T&#x27;s Engineering Department retained the responsibility for the growth of the Bell System with compatible equipment and service. Gradually the consolidation improved and advanced the telephony response to expanding use.

On July 24, 1915, employees of the Hawthorne Works boarded the SS &quot;Eastland&quot; in downtown Chicago for a company picnic. The ship rolled over at the dock and over 800 people died.

In 1920, Alice Heacock Seidel was the first female Western Electric employee to be given permission to stay on after she had married. This set a precedent in the company, which previously had not allowed married women in their employ. Miss Heacock had worked for Western Electric for sixteen years before her marriage, and was at the time the highest-paid secretary in the company. In her memoirs, she wrote that the decision to allow her to stay on &quot;required a meeting of the top executives to decide whether I might remain with the Company, for it established a precedent and a new policy for the Company – that of married women in their employ. If the women at the top were permitted to remain after marriage then all women would expect the same privilege. The policy was expanded quickly, so that a few years later women were given maternity leaves with no loss of time on their service records.&quot;

Western Electric was expanding beyond making telephone equipment and American Bell noticed its division from a manufacturing business to a supply business. Western Electric decided to split in 1921, the supply department from the manufacturing business and this led later to a separate entity.

In 1925, ITT purchased the Bell Telephone Manufacturing Company of Brussels, Belgium, and other worldwide subsidiaries from AT&amp;T, to avoid an antitrust action. The company manufactured rotary system switching equipment under the Western Electric brand.

Early on, Western Electric also managed an electrical equipment distribution business, furnishing its customers with non-telephone products made by other manufacturers This electrical distribution business was spun off from Western Electric in 1925 and organized into a separate company, Graybar Electric Company, in honor of the company&#x27;s founders, Elisha Gray and Enos Barton.
Bell Telephone Laboratories, created from the engineering department of Western Electric in 1925, was half-owned by Western Electric, the other half belonging to AT&amp;T.

The company began to increase its presence in other sectors of industry for new products. In September 1931, the Teletype Corporation headquartered in Chicago on Wrightwood Ave, became a subsidiary of Western Electric and it was a manufacturer of teletypewriters for TWX services. There was the acquisition in 1931 of the Nassau Smelting and Refining plant located in Totenville, Staten Island, New York to recycle Bell System scrap wire, metal, and becoming a subsidiary of Western Electric. The acquisition of the Queensboro factory in Middle Village, New York became a Western Electric Shop in the 1930s to produce wooden telephone booths.

In 1974, the IBEW members at Western Electric&#x27;s 16 plants went on strike over improved benefits, cost‐of‐living adjustments, and pay increase for up to three years. The ratified contract was agreed on September 3, 1974, with employees at 13 plants returning to work. Only the company&#x27;s subsidiary Teletype Corporation plant in Little Rock, Arkansas and two plants, the Columbia River Switching Equipment factory in Vancouver, Washington and in San Ramon, California were subject to ratification or in negotiations to settle local agreements.

In 1983, corporate announcements were made at the three oldest manufacturing facilities for product manufacturing transfers and employee expected layoffs. The Kearny Works facility that made systems to convert commercial power to run various telecom equipment, would transfer remaining work to Dallas Works. The shutdown of the plant would eliminate 4,000 jobs. The Baltimore Works facility that made connectors and protectors for wire and cable had work moved to Omaha Works. A total of 2,300 jobs were potentially eliminated after that announcement. The Hawthorne Works facility, had the operations for pulp cable relocated to Phoenix Works. A loss of 400 positions were expected eliminated in the process.

After the Bell System breakup, Western Electric facilities were known as AT&amp;T Technologies facilities in 1984. The three largest and oldest facilities, Hawthorne Works, Kearny Works, and Baltimore Works were closed shortly after due to &quot;excess space&quot;.

===Company logos===
Western Electric used various logos during its existence. Starting in 1914 it used an image of a statue originally named &quot;Electricity&quot;, but later renamed Spirit of Communication, which was raised to the roof of 195 Broadway on October 24, 1916.
==Presidents==

==Development of a monopoly==

In 1915, the assets of Western Electric Manufacturing were transferred to a newly incorporated company in New York, New York, named Western Electric Company, Inc, a wholly owned subsidiary of AT&amp;T. The sole reason for the transfer was to provide for the issuance of a non-voting preferred class of capital stock, disallowed under the statutes of the state of Illinois.

In the Bell System, telephones were leased by the operating companies to subscribers, and remained the property of the Bell System. Service subscribers paid a monthly fee included in the service charge, while paying additionally for special types or features of telephones, such as colored telephone sets. Equipment repair was included in the fees. This system had the effect of subsidizing basic telephone service, keeping local telephone service inexpensive, under $10 per month. After divestiture, basic service prices increased, and customers became responsible for inside building wiring and telephone equipment. The Bell System had an extensive policy and infrastructure to recycle or refurbish equipment taken out of service, replacing all defective, weak, or otherwise unusable parts for new installations. This resulted in extraordinary longevity of Western Electric telephones, and limited the variety of new designs introduced into the market place. This led Western Electric to pursue extreme reliability and durability in design to minimize service calls. In particular, the work of Walter A. Shewhart, who developed new techniques for statistical quality control in the 1920s, helped lead to the quality of manufacture of Western Electric telephones.

AT&amp;T also strictly enforced policies against using telephone equipment by other manufacturers on their network. A customer who insisted on using a telephone not supplied by the Bell System had to first transfer the phone to the local Bell operating company, who leased the phone back to the customer for a monthly charge in addition to a re-wiring fee. In the 1970s when consumers increasingly bought telephone sets from other manufacturers, AT&amp;T changed the policy for its Design Line telephone series by selling customers the phone housing, retaining ownership of the internal mechanical and electrical components, which still required paying AT&amp;T a monthly leasing fee.

Starting in 1983 with the breakup of the Bell System, Western Electric telephones could be sold to the public under the brand name American Bell, a newly created subsidiary of AT&amp;T. One of the terms of the Modification of Final Judgment in the Bell System divestiture procedures prohibited AT&amp;T from using the name &quot;Bell&quot; after January 1, 1984; prior to this, AT&amp;T&#x27;s plan was to market products and services under the American Bell name, accompanied by the now familiar AT&amp;T globe logo.

==Manufacturing plants==

In 1903, Western Electric began construction of the first buildings for Hawthorne Works on the outskirts of Chicago. In 1905, the Clinton Street power apparatus shops moved to Hawthorne.

Further expansion of large factories began in the 1920s. In 1923, construction began on the second factory located in Kearny, New Jersey. The location was known as Kearny Works and in 1925 began telephone cable production. On June 15, 1928, Western Electric employees, photographed by Rosenfeld and Sons, were pictured, in a groundbreaking ceremony, for their expansion of the Kearny Works manufacturing facility at 110 Central Ave, Kearny, New Jersey. Kearny Works would achieve the largest square foot size of 3,579,000 throughout the years and be the second largest plant for Western Electric manufacturing plants built before the 1930s, only second in size to the Hawthorne Works at Cicero, Illinois. Here is an aerial image of Kearny Works, between 1925 and 1930, held in the Library Company of Philadelphia. with the picture of the entire plant and railways. In 1929, work began at Point Breeze, Baltimore, Maryland as the third manufacturing location, Baltimore Works, began its occupancy by 1930 for various cable and wire production.

Two manufacturing plants in Lincoln, Nebraska were leased in 1943 to Western Electric to manufacture signal corps equipment and later production demands from Hawthorne Works. The Eighth Street building, known as &quot;Lincoln Shops,&quot; and the 13th Street building were the locations, the latter was sold in 1950 for $500,000 to Western Electric. The plants were closed after the Omaha Works opened in 1958.

Western Electric acquired in 1943, the old Grad and Winchell buildings located at Haverhill, Massachusetts. New Jersey supervisors taught former textile and shoe workers the manufacturing process of coil winding. The employees&#x27; acquired skills demonstrated their versatility in this new manufacturing process for a Western Electric decision to join Haverhill and Lawrence locations in 1956 as the Merrimack Valley Works.

In 1944, Western Electric purchased a factory in St. Paul, Minnesota to restart manufacture of telephone sets for civilian installation as authorized by War Production Board. By 1946, some of these facilities were relocated to the Hawthorne plant as space became available from war-production scale down.

Also, the reduced production of home telephones because of the war, began to have a backlog of two million orders in late 1945 for the Hawthorne plant. Western Electric had acquired a former Studebaker plant on Archer Avenue (Chicago, Illinois) for assemblers that produced out one hundred thousand Model 302s telephones by March 1946.

After World War II, the National Carbon Company left a facility that had manufactured United States Navy submarine batteries and underwater detonators in Winston-Salem. This facility at 800 Chatham Road, was passed to Western Electric Company and operated until 1966 for production of national telephone companies&#x27; switches and circuits. Additionally, the location complex was one of three nationwide Western Electric field engineering sites.

The mid-1940s brought occupancy to locations. A plant was established in 1946 at Tonawanda, New York to produce equipment wiring cable, telephone cords, enamelled wire, and insulated wire. This plant was called &quot;Buffalo Plant.&quot; A satellite shop was established in Jersey City, New Jersey called &quot;Marion Shops&quot; and occupied in 1947. This location produced portable test sets, rectifiers, and power equipment for the main plant known as the Kearny Works.

In July 1948, the equipment plant at Duluth, Minnesota was involved in the National Labors Act with bargaining units of IAM and IBEW.

After 1947, eight Works locations were built and occupied by 1961 at Allentown, Indianapolis, North Carolina, Merrimack Valley, Omaha, Columbus, Oklahoma City, and Kansas City for the high volume of manufacturing products. The North Carolina Works was located in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. The Merrimack Valley Works location was in North Andover, Massachusetts. The Kansas City Works location was in Lee&#x27;s Summit, Missouri.

A Lawrence, Massachusetts factory opened on November 13, 1951, and was called the &quot;Garfield Shops.&quot; The location started with as a wired units job and there were thirteen workers with a section chief and one maintenance man. In 1955, the Lawrence plant reached its peak employment at more than 2,000 employees. This Bell Labs research and development satellite had 40 Bell Telephone Laboratories engineers and 25 Western Electric employees. Carrier equipment used filters made with Polystyrene condensers at this Garfield Shops or later referred as Lawrence Shops.

In 1952, the Reading plant began when Western Electric converted an old Rosedale knitting mill in Laureldale into a factory. On August 22, 1952, the facility opened to produce new electronic components for the U.S. government for use by the military and the space program.

In the mid-1950s, Western Electric established several more satellite &quot;Shops&quot; that were smaller locations reporting to the larger &quot;Works&quot; locations. The &quot;Montgomery Shops&quot; were occupied in 1955 to produce Data-Phone data sets, wire spring relays, and test sets. Although, it was located in Montgomery, Illinois, it reported and supported production of the main plant, Hawthorne Works in Cicero, Illinois. The Kearny Works facility had satellite shops that were apart from its location but were part of the manufacturing process. Located in Fair Lawn, New Jersey and occupied since 1956, the &quot;Fair Lawn Shops&quot; produced coils, resistors, transformers, and keys under Kearny manufacturing. The Indianapolis Works facility was producing telephone sets and components with a satellite shop. The Indianapolis shop known as &quot;Washington Street Shop&quot; produced miscellaneous subscriber apparatus since its occupancy in 1957. The &quot;Lawrence Shop&quot; that was occupied in 1957 produced BELLBoy receivers, telephone repeaters and carrier products under Merrimack Valley Works. The &quot;Clark Shop&quot; was occupied in 1959 at Clark, New Jersey and manufactured submarine cable repeaters and components. The satellite shop was under Kearny Works.

The 1960s and 1970s had various new facilities built and occupied by Western Electric to produce new technologies such as electronic switching equipment (Dallas and North Illinois), fiber optic cable networks (Atlanta), power systems (Phoenix), business equipment (Denver), and telephone equipment (Shreveport).

In 1970, Western Electric purchased land in Bishop Ranch, San Ramon, California for a permanent plant. The 200,000 square-foot leased plant began in June 1971. In 1974, there were 490 IBEW employee members on strike over local agreement issues. In 1975, this San Ramon Valley Plant announced a September 30 closure of its telephone transmission equipment manufacturing operations.

On January 27, 1983, the Kearny facility was announced for closure due to technology changes, underutilized, and too costly to maintain. The phase out of the facility jobs started in fall of 1983 and the 59 year old, 3 million-square-foot, 144-acre facility was sold officially on May 21, 1984, with nearly 1000 last employees left at the plant. The former facility was purchased and later existed as warehouses, distribution, research and light manufacturing facilities.

As modern facilities around the country were used for the operations of Hawthorne and its productions distributed, announcement was made on June 24, 1983, for closure. Between 1975 and 1983, the Foundry and most of the Telephone Apparatus buildings were demolished and in 1986–1987, the remaining Telephone Apparatus buildings and the Executive Tower were demolished. The Hawthorne facility was in operations for 83 years when it closed its doors in 1986 and torn down for a shopping center. Another building was demolished on April 10, 1994, for a shopping center parking lot, with a remaining two buildings converted. A water tower is the remaining physical association of the industrial research complex where telephones, electronics, military equipment and business management innovations were produced by a facility that once existed.

The Baltimore facility closed on February 28, 1986. The facility, which had once employed 6,200, was staffed by 65 employees on the closure date.

By the time AT&amp;T was dissolved in the early 1980s, more than twenty production plants around the country (&quot;Works&quot; locations) had been established.

In 1967, a telephone directory provides the following snapshot of manufacturing facilities: 
==Distribution houses==

Western Electric had nine divisions in the mid-1960s. Manufacturing was one division, service was another, and there was also the distribution division. The distribution division was important for supplying the Bell System with day-to-day supply or emergency needs of the telecommunications supply chain. In 1964, there were 35 Distribution Houses that stocked equipment and supplies. They were the supply centers and repair shops for the Bell System. The distribution houses were established as east and west geographical zones in similarity to the service division. The following table showed the distribution houses at that time.
==Technological innovations==
In 1926, Western Electric issued the first Bell System telephone with a handset containing both the transmitter and receiver in the same unit. Previous telephones had been of the candlestick type which featured a stationary transmitter in the desktop set or the wall-mounted unit, and a hand-held receiver to be placed on the user&#x27;s ear. The first version of the desktop unit was constructed by shortening the candlestick shaft to about an inch in height and placing a handset cradle on the top. This was the A-type handset mounting, which was replaced by 1928 by the B handset mounting, which featured a streamlined shape integrating the shaft as a short neck for the cradle. It still had the same circular footprint of the candlestick, which proved too unstable when dialing numbers, and was henceforth replaced with a wider design using an oval footprint, the D-type base in 1930.

Concurrently with the mechanical advances, the electrical circuitry of Western Electric telephones saw advances in sidetone reduction. Sidetone is feedback by which the users of the telephone can hear their own voice in the receiver. While a desirable property, this feedback, when too loud, causes most users to lower their voice volume to unacceptable levels. Until after the introduction in 1930 of the D handset mountings, sets still contained no active sidetone compensation. Such handset telephone types were designated with the assembly code &quot;102&quot;, while later models containing anti-sidetone circuitry were the type 202 telephone set. These early desktop telephones relied on an additional &quot;desk set box&quot; or subscriber set (&quot;subset&quot;) containing the ringer with gongs, the induction coil, and capacitors to interface with the telephone network. These subscriber sets were typically mounted on a wall near the operating location for the telephone.

In 1936 the model 302 telephone was announced, which was the first Western Electric instrument that combined the desktop telephone set with the subscriber set and ringer in one unit. It became the mainstay of American telephone service well into the 1950s, and was followed by the model 500 telephone starting in 1950, which became the most extensively produced telephone model in the industry&#x27;s history. The 500-set was continually updated over time, reflecting new materials and manufacturing processes, such as quieter and smoother dial gearing and a printed circuit board for the network electronics. The model 500 was discontinued in 1986, in favor of the type 2500, that had been available since 1969. The 2500-series employed dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signaling for transmitting digits to the central office, replacing the rotary dial. DTMF technology was referred to by the trademark Touch-Tone.

Further innovations were evident when in 1954, the production of color telephones began to outproduce the black sets. Later, for 1958, production of the nite-light telephone, the Speakerphone, and the CALL DIRECTOR telephone were done at Indianapolis Works. Other innovations included the Princess telephones of the 1960s, followed shortly by the Trimline models.

Western Electric&#x27;s switching equipment development commenced in the mid-1910s with the rotary system and the panel switch, later several generations of cross-bar switches, and finally the development of several generations of electronic switching systems (ESS). The No. 1 ESS was first installed in 1965. The 4ESS was the first digital toll switching system, implemented in 1976. Finally, in 1981, the 5ESS was implemented throughout the United States.

In 1929, Western Electric entered as a market competitor for early cinema sound systems. It created the Western Electric Universal Base, a device by which early silent cinema projectors could be adapted to screen sound films. Western Electric designed a wide-audio-range horn loudspeaker for cinemas. This was estimated to be 25% efficient, thus allowing a cinema to be filled with sound from a 3-watt amplifier. This was an important breakthrough in 1929 because high-powered audio valves (tubes) were not generally available.

In addition to being a supplier to the Bell System, Western Electric played a major role in the development and production of professional sound recording and reproducing equipment, including:

* the Vitaphone system which brought sound to the movies;
* the electrical recording technology adopted by record companies in the late 1920s (despite the popular electrical system used by Autograph Records and its manager, Orlando R. Marsh);
* the Orthophonic phonograph, an acoustical phonograph with a flat frequency response tailored for reproduction of electrically recorded disks;
* the Westrex (variable density) optical sound that succeeded it for motion picture film production and release prints;
* the Westrex magnetic sound (mono and stereo) that succeeded it for motion picture film production and a few productions&#x27; release prints;
* the Westrex stereo variable-area optical sound that succeeded it for low-cost stereo release prints;
* the Westrex (Model 3, and derivatives) cutter and system for recording stereophonic sound in a single-groove gramophone record (StereoDisk®) that was compatible with monophonic equipment.
For these reasons, many American films of this period feature the Western Electric/Westrex logo in their on-screen credits.

In 1950, at the start of the Cold War, Western Electric was selected to build the first demonstrator for the SOSUS anti-submarine sound surveillance system. Later, the company was prime contractor for the Safeguard anti-ballistic missile system, which operated briefly from 1975.

==Manufacturing innovations==
Western Electric also invested heavily in improving processes and equipment to manufacture their products.

In 1958, the company established the Engineering Research Center (ERC) near Princeton, New Jersey. With a charter distinct from Bell Labs, Western Electric&#x27;s ERC was one of the first research organizations solely dedicated to the advancement of manufacturing-focused, rather than product-focused science. Here, more than 400 researchers and engineers worked to bring new manufacturing technologies into the company&#x27;s production environment. Their developments included computer-driven mathematical models and related statistical quality-control systems to improve production flow and logistics, novel metal-forming techniques, circuit board assembly automation, fiber-optic waveguide manufacturing techniques, application of lasers for industrial processes and early efforts in cleanroom robotics for semiconductor production. In the early 1970s, some of the first practical Ion Implanters to make integrated circuits were also developed at ERC and later deployed at Western Electric&#x27;s chip-making factories.

Although the ERC was later integrated into Bell Labs, it – along with AT&amp;T&#x27;s nearby Corporate Education Center – was closed by the late 1990s, victims of the deregulation of telecommunications, shrinking revenues from long-distance calls and accelerating innovation in telephone equipment by an increasing number of global manufacturing players.

==Management innovations==
* Western Electric were pioneers of the scientific management of Frederick Winslow Taylor.
* Walter A. Shewhart developed the control chart at the Hawthorne Works in 1924.
* Joseph M. Juran pioneered the use of statistical analysis for quality assurance at the Hawthorne Works.
* At Hawthorne Works, Cicero, Illinois, Elton Mayo conducted research of the effect on manufacturing productivity of lighting changes and work structure changes, such as working hours or break times. The reactivity identified in the studies became known as the Hawthorne effect.
* The Hawthorne experiments in industrial productivity were conducted there from 1924 to 1936.
* Western Electric&#x27;s reputation for sound management was such that in 1949 President Truman requested that Western Electric manage a major defense laboratory, Sandia National Labs.

==National Defense and Nike-Zeus==
Western Electric was authorized on November 15, 1955, with Air Force Contract AF33(616)-3285 to conduct a competitive study directed specifically only to anti-ICBM (AICBM) defense. In February 1957, the U.S. Army awarded the company, as a contractor, responsibility in developing an AICBM defense system called Nike Zeus. On February 12, 1959, a test program for Nike-Zeus was approved by Department of Defense for Kwajalein as the down-range test site. After the site was inspected on August 4, 1959, by Western Electric project managers and various agencies/contractors, the completion of the technical building and launch facilities were done. Shortly after, Western Electric equipment engineers and installers arrived for the installation of the NIKE-ZEUS test site. The North Carolina plant made the R&amp;D models for the system elements and installed, tested, and operated the components at the test site.

==NASA and Project Mercury==
In 1960, NASA awarded Western Electric a contract for over $33,000,000 () for engineering and construction of a tracking system for the Project Mercury program. As part of this effort, Western Electric engineers trained remote-site flight controllers and Project Mercury Control Center and operations personnel.

==Closure==
As of January 1, 1984, a newly formed company, AT&amp;T Technologies, Inc., assumed the corporate charter of Western Electric, which was split into several divisions, each focusing on a particular type of customer, e.g., AT&amp;T Technology Systems, and AT&amp;T Network Systems. Telephones made by Western Electric prior to the breakup continued to be manufactured and marked with the company emblem, however, lacking the Bell System logo, or having it hidden by metal filler inside of all telephone housings and most components, including new electronic integrated circuits with the initials &quot;WE&quot;. Electronic switching systems, outside plant materials, and other equipment produced for the consumption of the RBOCs continued to be marked &quot;AT&amp;T Western Electric&quot; well into the 1990s.

Cost-cutting measures resulted in the consumer telephones being redesigned and modernized in 1985, as well as more plastic being used in place of metal in the 500 &amp; 2500 series phones, as well as the Princess. In 1986, the Indianapolis Works telephone plant closed, and US production of AT&amp;T single-line home telephones ended. Business telephones and systems continued production in the Shreveport Works plant until 2001. Home telephones were redesigned, and production was moved to Hong Kong, Singapore, China, and Thailand. Western Electric no longer marked housings of telephones with &quot;WE&quot;, but continued to mark the modular plugs of telephone cords with &quot;WE&quot;.

Western Electric came to an end in 1995 when AT&amp;T changed the name of AT&amp;T Technologies to Lucent Technologies, in preparation for its spinoff. Lucent became independent in 1996, and sold more assets into Advanced American Telephones, Agere Systems, Avaya, and Consumer Phone Services. Lucent itself merged with Alcatel, forming Alcatel-Lucent, which was acquired by Nokia in 2016. Western Electric&#x27;s structured cabling unit, once known as AT&amp;T Network Systems or SYSTIMAX, was spun off from Avaya and became part of CommScope.

==Subsequent developments==

Since the demise of Western Electric, telephone equipment design and manufacturing is an open market place in which numerous manufacturers compete. As a result, modern telephones are now manufactured in Asia, generally using less expensive components and labor.

Some telephone subscribers declined to purchase their existing telephones after the AT&amp;T breakup, and continued to lease their existing Western Electric models from QLT Consumer Lease Services, formerly known as AT&amp;T Consumer Lease Services. Such subscribers paid leasing fees for their telephones far in excess of the purchase price, but the phones were perceived by some users to be superior to telephones commonly made today in aspects of durability and sound quality. Today, many of these Western Electric telephones have become collector&#x27;s items.

Western Electric&#x27;s audio equipment from the 1920s and 30s, designed to be used in movie theaters, is now prized by collectors and audiophiles due to its quality construction and sound reproduction. This includes its massive horn loudspeakers designed to fill a large theater with sound from a relatively low-powered tube amplifier.

=== Name acquisition ===
In 1995, the license to manufacture vacuum tubes, audio equipment, and the stylized brand name &quot;Western Electric&quot; trademark was acquired by &quot;Western Electric Export Corporation&quot;, a privately owned high-end audio company in Rossville, Georgia. The company specializes in manufacturing vacuum tubes&lt;ref name=&quot;Honeycutt/Audio Xpress&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and high end audio equipment. Amongst other products, the company has revived the Western Electric 300B electron tube.

==Publications==

During the span of its existence of over a dozen decades, Western Electric published a variety of publications for various audiences, including periodicals for employees and customers.

The first employee magazine was &quot;Western Electric News&quot;, commencing in March 1912 (Volume 1, Number 1) under company president Harry Bates Thayer. Its purpose was to provide a forum where ideas could be exchanged, the company events and activities could be recorded, and to serve as clearing house for technical and commercial information of value to the employee.

In November 1935, Western Electric published a magazine, &quot;Pickups&quot;, for its developments in sound transmissions, mostly for its radio and communications customers. The magazine changed its name to &quot;Oscillator&quot; after the May 1942 issue was published and returned in September 1944 with the issue after a hiatus. There are approximately thirty-three issues archived of Western Electric&#x27;s radio history up to November 1948.

In 1948, Western Electric began publishing the monthly house magazine &quot;WE&quot; for employees of the company. The magazine was published into the 1980s.
Starting in 1957, Western Electric published &quot;The Western Electric Engineer&quot; (), later known as &quot;The Engineer&quot;, on a subscription basis.

==Educational films==
Western Electric produced many educational and marketing films that focused on the products associated with telephony or the company&#x27;s inventions. For example,
* &quot;Finding His Voice&quot; (1929) is an animated cartoon with voice and sound. The animation shows using a sound booth to pick up sound on a microphone. It also explains the process of using a machine to record sound to film. The cartoon shows a picture and sound projector called the Vitaphone, which was invented in 1926.
* &quot;Bottling Electrons&quot; (1930s) is a treatise on the manufacture of vacuum tubes.
* &quot;A Miracle for Mrs. Smith&quot; (1940s) is a film showing &quot;how the Bell telephone system works and how Western Electric manufactures the materials and products used in the telephone industry.&quot;
* &quot;Adventure In Telezonia&quot; (1950) is a puppet film intended to teach proper telephone usage. It uses puppets by Bil Baird.
* &quot;A Family Affair&quot; (1955) is a promotional film about using telephones in a home environment. There is an appearance by actor Steve McQueen.
* &quot;Tools of Telephony&quot; version 1 (1956) introduced telephones, cables, and switching frames that were made, installed, warehoused, or bought by Western Electric. The film promoted the manufacturing and supply unit for the Bell System with twenty-one manufacturing locations, seventeen installation areas, twenty-nine distribution chain warehouses, and purchasing systems for its plants and operating companies.
* &quot;Tools of Telephony&quot; version 2 (1958) introduced the teletype, remote feeding of electronic brain calculators, nationwide television transmission, remote control of systems for industry, and telephones. It promoted the manufacturing and supply unit for the Bell System with manufacturing locations, seventeen installation areas, a purchasing system, and a chain of distribution houses.
* &quot;Speedy Cutover Service&quot; (1984) showed an electronic switching system.

<text>The Reformist Movement (, , MR) is a liberal French-speaking political party in Belgium, which includes social-liberal and conservative-liberal factions. Stemming from the Belgian Liberal Party founded in 1846, the MR is one of the oldest parties on the European continent.

Since October 2014, the party has provided two prime ministers: Charles Michel and Sophie Wilmès. It has been a member of every federal government since the 2000s. At the federated entities level, the MR was in charge of Wallonia from 2017 to 2019 with Willy Borsus as Minister-President of Wallonia. It is currently in charge of the French community with Pierre-Yves Jeholet as Minister-President of the French community.

The MR emerged victorious from the 2024 elections, becoming the leading French-speaking party. In Wallonia, the party came out on top with 29.6% of the vote. In Brussels, the MR also placed first, with 25.9% of the vote. Just a few days after the elections, the MR announced it would work closely with Les Engagés to quickly form governments in the Walloon Region and the French community. Having a majority on the French-speaking side of the Federal parliament, they joined forces to work on the formation of a new Belgian government.

The MR is an alliance between three French-speaking and one German-speaking liberal parties. The Liberal Reformist Party (PRL) and the Francophone Democratic Federalists (FDF) started the alliance in 1993, and were joined in 1998 by the Citizens&#x27; Movement for Change (MCC). The alliance was then known as the PRL-FDF-MCC federation. The alliance became the MR during a congress in 2002, where the German-speaking liberal party, the Party for Freedom and Progress joined as well. The label PRL is no longer used, and the three other parties still use their own names. The MR is a member of Liberal International and the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) Party. However, on 25 September 2011, the FDF decided to leave the coalition. They did not agree with the manner in which president Charles Michel defended the rights of the French-speaking people in the agreement concerning the splitting of the Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde district, during the 2010–11 Belgian government formation.

==Ideology and policies==
Over the years, the MR has always oscillated between ideological markers closer to conservative liberalism or social liberalism. Its fundamental principles remain however the same through time, such as defending civil liberties, free market, entrepreneurial freedom, and equal opportunities.

During Georges-Louis Bouchez&#x27;s tenure as party president, the party is said to have shifted further to the right, aligning more with the centre-right. Bouchez has for example often publicly pointed out some excesses of the woke movement.

On its current platform, the party advocates higher revenues through lower taxes; time-limited unemployment benefits; life extension of the most recent nuclear reactors; greater investment in police, justice and defense; less government and state neutrality. MR is &quot;belgicain&quot;, in favor of Belgian unity and a strong federal state.

=== Foreign policy ===
The MR is also a strong supporter of the European Union and NATO. It has always defended support, including military aid, for Ukraine since the Russian invasion in 2022. In 2024, the MR was the only party from De Croo Government to be opposed to Belgium recognizing the State of Palestine.

<doc id="229972" wikidata="Q840814" url="?curid=229972" title="Les Engagés">
<text> (LE, , ) is a centrist French-speaking political party in Belgium. The party originated in the split in 1972 of the unitary Christian Social Party (PSC-CVP), which had been the country&#x27;s governing party for much of the post-war period. It continued to be called the Christian Social Party (, PSC) until 2002 when it was renamed the Humanist Democratic Centre (, CDH). It took its current name on 17 March 2022, and currently is a member of the governing national coalition in Belgium, along with the Walloon and French Community coalition governments. 

== History ==
The PSC was officially founded in 1972. The foundation was the result of the split of the unitary Christian Social Party (PSC-CVP) into the Dutch-speaking Christian People&#x27;s Party (CVP) and the French-speaking Christian Social Party (PSC), following the increased linguistic tensions after the crisis at the Catholic University of Leuven in 1968. The PSC performed particularly badly in the 1999 general election. This was linked to several scandals, such as the escape of Marc Dutroux and the discovery of dioxine in chickens (the PSC was a coalition partner in the Dehaene government). The decline in votes was also explained by declining adherence to Catholicism. The party was confined to opposition on all levels of government.

The party started a process of internal reform. In 2001, a new charter of principles, the &quot;Charter of Democratic Humanism,&quot; was adopted and in 2002 the party adopted a new constitution and a new name, Humanist Democratic Centre. On 17 March 2022, the party changed to its current name and political colors. On 10 October 2022, Virginie Lefrancq, a Brussels MP, announced that she was leaving Les Engagés, feeling politically orphaned.

After the 2024 European Parliament election in Belgium, Les Engagés sole elected MEP, Yvan Verougstraete, announced that he would sit with the Renew Europe group; the party subsequently withdrew from the European People&#x27;s Party and joined the European Democratic Party.

==Ideology==

The party considers itself to be a movement rather than a party, and calls for citizen-led initiatives and more engagement between the public and politicians. The party has dropped all its Christian references and now defines itself as a party working for the &quot;common good&quot;; it has subsequently withdrawn from the Christian Democratic European People&#x27;s Party (EPP) and joined the centrist European Democratic Party (EDP).

On its manifesto, the party supports NATO, the EU, secularism and LGBT rights. Les Engagés supports intensifying awareness and information campaigns on gender and homosexuality, as well as the reimbursement of gynecological and andrological care for trans people.

<text>The National Democracy (, ) is a francophone Belgian far-right political party. The party advocated a strong unitary Belgian nationalism, strongly opposed immigration, and reached out to Flemish voters.

The party&#x27;s acting leader is Marco Santi.

In the 2003 federal election, it won one seat in the Chamber of Representatives, with 2% of the vote. It also had two seats in the Senate. A 2006 poll showed that it had the backing of about 9.4% of the Walloon voters. Despite this poll it won in the 10 June 2007 federal elections, 1 out of 150 seats in the Chamber of Representatives and 1 out of 40 seats in the Senate.

==Development==
The DN was established by Daniel Féret, a former member of Jeune Europe who subsequently was active with the populist . The party clashed with the Party of New Forces (PFN) from its foundation as Féret sought to distance his group from the far-right but despite his efforts a number of extremist activists soon joined the DN. The party&#x27;s ideology soon became one of ultra-nationalism, xenophobia, racism and anti-Flemish sentiment, combined with a strong support for neo-liberal economics. They also look to their French namesake and followed many of their ideas, although the interest was not reciprocated as Jean-Marie Le Pen generally looked elsewhere in Belgium for allies, that is also the reason why the changed their name into National Democratie. In 1989 a number of PFN members switched to the FN due to internal difficulties in their party and as a result the FN again shifted policy, abandoning its earlier pro-NATO stance in favour opposition to both the USA and the Soviet Union.

After electing some local councillors in 1988 and 1989 the FN made a surprise breakthrough at the 1991 election by getting a member elected to parliament. The election caused a furore in Belgium and the other parties declared a Cordon sanitaire around the party. In response the FN adopted a more anti-establishment and anti-politics attitude, which struck a chord with some voters, resulting in the party sending a member to the European Parliament in 1994 and returning two members of parliament in 1995.

Despite these successes the DN was in a state of turmoil due to personality clashes and internal ideological differences, precipitating a long court case between two factions, both claiming use of the FN name. With most of their elected representatives leaving the party, the FN appeared moribund until in 1997 &quot;Agir&quot;, a far-right party with support in Liège, merged into them following internal difficulties of their own. With the influx of new members they were able to regroup for the 1999 elections, gaining a new member of the Senate and three members of the regional parliament.

==Brussels Appeals Court conviction==
The party&#x27;s original leader, Daniel Féret, was sentenced to 250 hours of community service on April 18, 2006, for the incitement of hatred, discrimination and segregation in the party&#x27;s flyers and website. He is also barred from running for political office for 10 years. The webmaster of the National Front site was also convicted, and barred for 7 years. Their convictions were upheld by a superior court in October 2006.

==2006 elections==
In Wallonia, members of the National Front could not run using the party name during the 2006 municipal elections, because the party failed to use the correct electoral procedure. In Brussels, the National Front ran under its acronym: FN.

<text>David Andrew Seaman (born 19 September 1963) is an English former footballer who played as a goalkeeper. In a career lasting from 1981 to 2004, he is best known for his time playing for Arsenal. He won 75 caps for England, and is the country&#x27;s second-most capped goalkeeper, after Peter Shilton. In 1997, he was awarded the MBE for services to football.

Seaman began his career in the Football League for Peterborough United, Birmingham City and Queens Park Rangers. The peak of his career was during his period as Arsenal and England goalkeeper in the 1990s and early 2000s. During his time at Arsenal, he won three league championships (1991, 1998, 2002), four FA Cups (1993, 1998, 2002, 2003), the League Cup in 1993 and the European Cup Winners Cup in 1994. During this time he also played for England in the 1998 and 2002 FIFA World Cups, and Euro 96 and Euro 2000. After leaving Arsenal, he played in the Premier League for Manchester City. He retired in 2004 due to a recurring shoulder injury. In June 2012, he was appointed goalkeeping coach of Combined Counties League club Wembley.

Seaman is considered to be one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time, as well as one of the best shot-stoppers in Premier League and English football history. He placed second in the IFFHS World&#x27;s Best Goalkeeper of the Year award in 1996, behind Andreas Köpke, while he placed 32nd, alongside Enrico Albertosi, in the European Keeper of the Century vote, which was organised by the same organisation, the fourth–highest ranked English goalkeeper. In 2013, James McNicholas of Bleacher Report described Seaman as &quot;the greatest goalkeeper in Arsenal&#x27;s history.&quot; In addition to his goalkeeping ability, Seaman was also a highly recognisable figure on the pitch due to his moustache and the ponytail hairstyle he wore for part of his career.

Seaman&#x27;s save from Paul Peschisolido of Sheffield United in the 2002–03 FA Cup semi-final was described in the media as one of the best ever. Notable lows came with two costly errors, both from long-range efforts—conceding a last-minute goal in the 1995 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup Final to Nayim of Real Zaragoza, and conceding to a Ronaldinho free kick against Brazil in the 2002 FIFA World Cup quarter-final. Seaman is left-handed, but threw the ball with his right arm and kicked with his right foot.

== Club career ==
=== Early career ===
Seaman was born in Rotherham, West Riding of Yorkshire. He attended Kimberworth Comprehensive School. He began his career at Leeds United, the club he supported as a boy. Much to his disappointment, he was not wanted by then-manager Eddie Gray, who had been his favourite player. Seaman went to Fourth Division club Peterborough United for a £4,000 fee in August 1982, where he began to make a name for himself.

Just over two years later, in October 1984, Second Division Birmingham City paid £100,000 for Seaman&#x27;s services. They ended up being promoted at the end of that season, but were relegated again at the end of the following season. Seaman was not to follow them back to the Second Division, as in August 1986, he moved to Queens Park Rangers for £225,000. Playing for a higher profile club on a plastic pitch, he would be called up by the England national football team for the first time in November 1988. Whilst at QPR, Seaman was coached by Bob Wilson (Arsenal&#x27;s double-winner in 1971), who was to work with him for more than a decade.

=== Arsenal ===

In 1990, long before the current transfer window system had come to English football, there was still a transfer deadline a few weeks before the end of the season. Arsenal, who had won the league in 1989, wanted to sign Seaman, but the deal involved Arsenal&#x27;s keeper John Lukic heading the opposite way on loan. Lukic did not want to do this, and the deal broke down and remained unresolved when the deadline passed. As soon as the season ended and clubs were allowed to buy players again, Arsenal manager George Graham came back for Seaman, with £1.3 million (at the time a British record for a goalkeeper) being the agreed fee. Lukic, who was highly popular amongst Arsenal fans, left to rejoin Leeds.

Seaman&#x27;s time at Arsenal coincided with one of the most successful periods in the club&#x27;s history. The 1990–91 season saw Seaman concede only 18 goals when playing in every match of the 38-game season as Arsenal regained the league title.

Arsenal won both the FA Cup and the League Cup in 1993 and supplemented this a year later with the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. Arsenal began their victorious League Cup campaign against Millwall and after two legs the game went to a penalty shootout. Seaman saved three of the four Millwall penalties from Malcolm Allen, Jon Goodman and Colin Cooper to help his side progress.

In 1995, George Graham was sacked, and Arsenal came close to becoming the first club to retain the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, with Seaman earning a reputation as a penalty-saving specialist after saving from Siniša Mihajlović, Vladimir Jugović and Attilio Lombardo in Arsenal&#x27;s semi-final shoot-out against U.C. Sampdoria, all the while playing with two cracked ribs. Arsenal lost in the final to Real Zaragoza, at the Parc des Princes in Paris, when Nayim scored a goal in the final minute of extra time with a 40-yard lob over Seaman.

In August 1996, Arsène Wenger became the new manager of Arsenal. Wenger rated Seaman highly and in 1998, Seaman helped the team to the Premier League and FA Cup double. In 1998–99, Seaman played all 38 league matches, conceding only 17 league goals as Arsenal came within one point of retaining the Premier League and lost in the FA Cup semi-finals to Manchester United. The following season Seaman managed to reach the 2000 UEFA Cup Final, which Arsenal drew 0–0 with Galatasaray, but lost on penalties.

In 2002, Seaman won the Premier League and the FA Cup again to complete his second career double, although Arsenal&#x27;s other goalkeepers Stuart Taylor (10 appearances) and Richard Wright (12 appearances) also won championship medals, due mainly to Seaman&#x27;s absence through injuries. A highlight of this season was when Seaman dramatically saved a Gareth Barry penalty as Arsenal won 2–1 at Aston Villa.

Despite his international career ending so flatly and accusations his mobility had faded with age, the 2002–03 season—Seaman&#x27;s last at Arsenal—ended on a high note. He began the season with saving a Freddie Kanoute penalty in a draw at Upton Park. In the FA Cup, he made a save against Sheffield United&#x27;s Paul Peschisolido in the semi-finals, which former Manchester United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel, a pundit for the BBC on the day, dubbed &quot;the best save I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;. Arsenal were defending a 1–0 lead, when with less than ten minutes to go, Peschisolido had a header towards an apparently open goal from six yards out with Seaman seemingly stranded at the near post. Seaman leapt sideways and backwards, managing to stretch his right arm behind him and scoop the ball back and away from both his goal and the opposing players ready to pounce on a rebound. The match was Seaman&#x27;s 1,000th professional career game. Seaman went on to captain the team during the 2003 FA Cup Final in the absence of injured Patrick Vieira and keep another clean sheet at the Millennium Stadium as they defeated Southampton 1–0. His final act with Arsenal was to lift the FA Cup, which was his ninth major trophy with his team. Seaman played in goal for Arsenal more times than anyone else, and is second after Ray Parlour in the all-time Premier League appearances chart for Arsenal, with 325 to his name. In June 2008 he was voted seventh in the list of 50 Gunners&#x27; Greatest Players.

=== Manchester City ===
Released by Arsenal, Seaman joined up with Kevin Keegan at Manchester City in the summer of 2003, but Seaman&#x27;s career at the City of Manchester Stadium did not last long. Whilst out of action due to injury, Seaman announced his immediate retirement in January 2004 at the age of 40. His last act at City was to help Keegan select his successor in goal, David James — the man who had ousted him as England&#x27;s first-choice goalkeeper a little over a year earlier.

In November 2005, Paul Merson and Walsall approached Seaman, and later ex-Wales goalkeeper Neville Southall and Chris Woods, to play in an FA Cup game at Merthyr Tydfil as their two first-choice keepers, Joe Murphy and Andy Oakes, were unavailable. Seaman was forced to turn this offer down, as it would have constituted a breach in the terms of his retirement insurance pay-out for his recurring shoulder injury.

== International career ==
Seaman made his England debut in 1988 and appeared for the side in fifteen consecutive years, a national record, since equalled by Rio Ferdinand.

Seaman earned his first England cap under Bobby Robson in a friendly against Saudi Arabia in November 1988. Robson selected him as England&#x27;s third-choice goalkeeper behind Peter Shilton and Chris Woods at the 1990 FIFA World Cup, but after arriving in Italy he had to pull out of the squad due to injury and was replaced by Dave Beasant.

Seaman remained a member of the England squad under new manager Graham Taylor, although he was not selected for Euro 1992. During qualification for the 1994 World Cup, Seaman played in the crucial game against the Netherlands, which England lost 2–0; he also played in the final match against San Marino, in which Davide Gualtieri scored after 8.3 seconds before England recovered to win 7–1. England ultimately failed to qualify for the tournament.

Seaman cemented his place as the undisputed number-one keeper with the arrival of Terry Venables as manager, and played every minute of every match during Euro 96. Seaman saved two spot-kicks in the tournament; the first a penalty in normal play from Scotland&#x27;s Gary McAllister in a group match, while England were 1–0 up (Paul Gascoigne scored soon after to make it 2–0). Then, after England&#x27;s quarter-final against Spain ended scoreless, Seaman saved Miguel Ángel Nadal&#x27;s kick in the shootout to knock Spain out of the tournament. England eventually were eliminated in the semi-final by Germany on penalties, after Andreas Köpke saved the penalty taken by Gareth Southgate. Seaman was named alongside Golden Boot winner Alan Shearer and winger Steve McManaman in the UEFA &quot;Team of the Tournament&quot;. Euro 96 sponsor Philips named him &quot;Player of the Tournament&quot;.

Seaman remained the first choice under the management of Glenn Hoddle for the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France. Seaman kept two clean sheets in the group stage as England finished second behind Romania. In the round of 16 England faced Argentina. Seaman conceded a penalty as the game finished 2–2, before England lost on penalties. Kevin Keegan selected him for UEFA Euro 2000, where he started against both Portugal and Germany but sustained an injury in his warm-up exercises for the third game against Romania and was replaced by Nigel Martyn. England lost the match and went out in the first round.

Seaman was part of Sven-Göran Eriksson&#x27;s 2002 FIFA World Cup squad and played every game as England reached the quarter-finals, turning back a second-half offensive to shut out arch-rivals Argentina 1–0 in the group stage after English captain David Beckham scored a penalty. In the quarter-final against Brazil, Seaman was caught off his line by Ronaldinho&#x27;s long-range free kick, as England lost 2–1; he blamed himself for the error.

The result led to a debate about whether Seaman should remain England&#x27;s number one. He remained England&#x27;s first-choice goalkeeper until a Euro 2004 qualifier in October 2002 against Macedonia. In this match, he let in a goal directly from a corner kick by Artim Šakiri in a 2–2 draw and brought further press criticism. This was Seaman&#x27;s last appearance for the England national team, as Eriksson dropped him in favour of David James.

== Style of play ==
At his peak during the 1990s, Seaman was regarded as one of the best goalkeepers in the world, earning praise from other goalkeepers such as Sepp Maier and Francesco Toldo. A tall and well–rounded keeper, with a large frame, he was known for his bravery, quick reflexes, agility, and excellent positional sense, as well as his reliable handling and ability to judge the ball, which allowed him to come out and collect crosses and command his area effectively, earning him the nickname &quot;safe hands&quot; in the media; although he was not particularly flashy in his style of goalkeeping, he was regarded as an efficient and generally reliable goalkeeper, who was known for his cool demeanour, authoritative presence, and calm composure in goal, as well as his leadership and ability to organise his back–line, which inspired a sense of confidence in his teammates. He was also adept at stopping penalties. Seaman is left-handed, but threw the ball with his right arm, and also kicked with his right foot.

Despite his ability in his prime, and his overall longevity, he was also known for being inconsistent and prone to errors on occasion, in particular in his later career, following a series of injuries, and also due to his own advancing age, which ultimately led to his physical decline and a series of less convincing performances; he also frequently struggled to deal with long–range shots throughout his career. In 2014, when recounting his famous lobbed goal against Seaman in the 1995 Cup Winners&#x27; Cup final, Nayim stated that his attempt was premeditated, as during his time in England, he came to learn that Arsenal usually played with a high defensive line, with Seaman essentially acting as a sweeper-keeper due to his tendency to stay off his line. In 2006, &quot;The Irish Times&quot; described Seaman as a &quot;serial choker,&quot; due to several high-profile errors he committed in key matches, in particular at international level, and described him as one of several unreliable keepers that played for England since the end of the &quot;tradition of solid goalkeeping which seemed unbreakable through the era of Banks, Clemence, Shilton, etc.&quot;, a notion with which Sriram Ilango of Bleacher Report concurred in 2009. In 2018, Eurosport noted that: &quot;Since the retirement of Peter Shilton, the position of England&#x27;s goalkeeper has claimed plenty of casualties. Even the most stable of its occupants, David Seaman, will be remembered for the embarrassment caused when Ronaldinho sent a free-kick floating over his head at the 2002 World Cup.&quot; While Seaman possessed a deep goal kick and a long throw, which suited Arsenal&#x27;s quick counter–attacking style of play under manager Arsène Wenger, he was not particularly adept with the ball at his feet, and his distribution was also not always reliable; as such he preferred to clear the ball away when receiving back-passes, rather than attempting to play it out from the back.

== Later career ==
Seaman began working on his coaching badge with a view to coaching goalkeepers but decided to pause after learning that he would first need a badge in outfield coaching in which he had no interest. His on-screen presence made him a popular choice for chat shows and televised appearances during his sporting career, and he can occasionally be spotted on British television. Whilst still a player, he acted in a cameo role in a BBC film based around the events of England&#x27;s successful Euro 1996 tournament, starring Rachel Weisz and Neil Morrissey, entitled &quot;My Summer with Des&quot;. He also became the spokesman for Yorkshire Tea during the early 1990s. He briefly replaced Gary Lineker as team captain on the television quiz &quot;They Think It&#x27;s All Over&quot;, before producers decided to drop him in favour of former Arsenal teammate Ian Wright.

In December 2004, following his retirement from professional football, he became one of the celebrities to take part in &quot;Strictly Ice Dancing&quot;, an ice dance version of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, in which celebrities are paired with professional dancers. He joined the show at late notice, replacing Paul Gascoigne. With just eight days to prepare for the show, broadcast on BBC One on 26 December, Seaman and his professional partner Zoia Birmingham managed to win the competition. The other competitors spent a month in training for the show.

In late 2005, he had his trademark ponytail cut off on live television for charity, which ended negotiatory talks with such companies as L&#x27;Oréal, who wanted to sponsor his hair as they had with David Ginola. He returned to the ice for another ice-dancing series, &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot;, broadcast on ITV. The series started on 14 January 2006, and Seaman ended in fourth place. He has also appeared on &quot;All Star Family Fortunes&quot;.

Seaman also hosts a &quot;Safe Hands&quot; charity golf event annually, and has released two football-themed DVDs entitled &quot;David Seaman&#x27;s Goalkeeping Nightmares&quot; in 2003 and &quot;Jeepers Keepers&quot; in 2004. Seaman has also played in all six Soccer Aid matches for England.

In June 2012, Seaman joined Combined Counties League club Wembley as goalkeeping coach for their 2012–13 FA Cup campaign, as part of a television documentary following the club&#x27;s attempt to play at Wembley. Former international players Graeme Le Saux, Ray Parlour, Martin Keown, Claudio Caniggia and Brian McBride joined the playing squad, with former England manager Terry Venables as technical advisor.

In 2019 and 2020, Seaman featured in both seasons of ITV show &quot;Harry&#x27;s Heroes&quot;, which featured former football manager Harry Redknapp attempting get a squad of former England international footballers back fit and healthy for a game against Germany legends.

In 2021, he began presenting his own podcast series &quot;Seaman Says&quot;. The series followed England throughout UEFA Euro 2020, with a second series starting at the beginning of the new season in August.

In October 2022, Seaman and his wife Frankie Poultney appeared in the second series of &quot;The Masked Dancer&quot; as &quot;Pillar and Post&quot;. They were unmasked in the fifth episode.

== Personal life ==
Seaman married his first wife, Sandra, in 1985; the marriage lasted ten years. He met his second wife, Debbie Rodgers, in 1995. They were married at Castle Ashby House in Castle Ashby in Northamptonshire on 15 July 1998; the couple separated in 2009 and were divorced in 2010. On 7 February 2015, Seaman married his third wife Frankie Poultney, best known as a professional skater on &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot;. Seaman announced their engagement in December 2013; the pair met in 2008, and had been in a relationship since 2009. He has four children: two sons from his first marriage, and a son and daughter from his second marriage.

Seaman&#x27;s autobiography – &quot;Safe Hands&quot; – was released in 2000, published by Orion.

<text>Rorquals () are the largest group of baleen whales, comprising the family Balaenopteridae, which contains nine extant species in two genera. They include the largest known animal that has ever lived, the blue whale, which can reach , and the fin whale, which reaches ; even the smallest of the group, the northern minke whale, reaches .

Rorquals take their name from French , which derives from the Norwegian word : the first element originated from the Old Norse name for this type of whale, , probably related to the Norse word for &quot;red&quot;, and the second from the Norse word &quot;hvalr&quot; meaning &quot;whale&quot; in general. The family name Balaenopteridae is from the type genus, &quot;Balaenoptera&quot;.

== Characteristics ==
All members of the family have a series of longitudinal folds of skin running from below the mouth back to the navel (except the sei whale and common minke whale, which have shorter grooves). These furrows allow the mouth to expand immensely when feeding. These &quot;pleated throat grooves&quot; distinguish balaenopterids from other whales.

Rorquals are slender and streamlined in shape, compared with their relatives the right whales, and most have narrow, elongated flippers. They have a dorsal fin, situated about two-thirds the way back. Most rorquals feed by gulping in water, and then pushing it out through the baleen plates with their tongue; the exception is the gray whale, which gulps in and filters large amounts of marine sediments from the seafloor. They feed on crustaceans, such as krill, but also on various fish, such as herrings and sardines.

Gestation in rorquals lasts 11–12 months, so that both mating and birthing occur at the same time of year. Cows give birth to a single calf, which is weaned after 6–12 months, depending on species. Of some species, adults live in small groups, or &quot;pods&quot; of two to five individuals. For example, humpback whales have a fluid social structure, often engaging behavioral practices in a pod, other times being solitary.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Distribution is worldwide: the blue, fin, humpback, and the sei whales are found in all major oceans; the common (northern) and Antarctic (southern) minke whale species are found in all the oceans of their respective hemispheres; either of Bryde&#x27;s whale and Eden&#x27;s whale occur in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans, being absent only from the cold waters of the Arctic and Antarctic; and the gray whale is found in the northern Pacific Ocean, although it was also found in the Atlantic Ocean in historic times. Rice&#x27;s whale has the smallest distribution of rorquals and possibly baleen whales in general, being endemic to a small portion of the Gulf of Mexico west of the Florida peninsula and south of Alabama and the Florida panhandle, although it likely formerly had a much wider distribution in the Gulf.

Most rorquals are strictly oceanic: the exceptions are the gray whale, Bryde&#x27;s whale, Eden&#x27;s whale, and Rice&#x27;s whale (which are usually found close to shore all year round) and the humpback whale (which is oceanic but passes close to shore when migrating). It is the largest and the smallest types — the blue whale and Antarctic minke whale — that occupy the coldest waters in the extreme south; the fin whale tends not to approach so close to the ice shelf; the sei whale tends to stay further north again. (In the northern hemisphere, where the continents distort weather patterns and ocean currents, these movements are less obvious, although still present.) Within each species, the largest individuals tend to approach the poles more closely, while the youngest and fittest ones tend to stay in warmer waters before leaving on their annual migration.

Most rorquals breed in tropical waters during the winter, then migrate back to the polar feeding grounds rich in plankton and krill for the short polar summer.

== Feeding habits ==
As well as other methods, rorquals obtain prey by lunge-feeding on bait balls. Lunge feeding is an extreme feeding method, where the whale accelerates to a high velocity and then opens its mouth to a large gape angle. This generates the water pressure required to expand its mouth and engulf and filter a huge amount of water and fish. In contrast to typical lunge feeding, Gray whales employ a unique suction feeding strategy to capture prey near or on the sea bottom.

Rorquals have a number of anatomical features that enable them to do this, including bilaterally separate mandibles, throat pleats that can expand to huge size, and a unique sensory organ consisting of a bundle of mechanoreceptors that helps their brains to coordinate the engulfment action. Furthermore, their large nerves are flexible so that they can stretch and recoil. In fact, they give rorquals the ability to open their mouths so wide that they would be capable of taking in water at volumes greater than their own sizes. These nerves are packed into a central core area that is surrounded by elastin fibers. Opening the mouth causes the nerves to unfold, and they snap back after the mouth is closed. According to Potvin and Goldbogen, lunge feeding in rorquals represents the largest biomechanical event on Earth.

== Taxonomy ==


Formerly, the rorqual family Balaenopteridae was split into two subfamilies, the Balaenopterinae and the Megapterinae, with each subfamily containing one genus, &quot;Balaenoptera&quot; and &quot;Megaptera&quot;, respectively. However, the phylogeny of the various rorqual species shows the current division is paraphyletic, and in 2005, the division into subfamilies was dropped. Two genetic studies, one in 2018 and one in 2020, suggest that the gray whale (&quot;Eschrichtius robustus&quot;) be counted among the rorquals, being more derived than the two minke whales but basal to the humpback whale, fin whale, and the other taxa classified in &quot;Balaenoptera&quot;.

The discovery of a new species of balaenopterid, Omura&#x27;s whale (&quot;Balaenoptera omurai&quot;), was announced in November 2003, which looks similar to, but smaller than, the fin whale; individuals of this species were found in Indo-Pacific waters. The discovery of the highly endangered Rice&#x27;s whale was announced in 2021 after a genetic study found it to be distinct from Bryde&#x27;s whale; this species is known from a small portion of the northeastern Gulf of Mexico.
