<text>We () is a dystopian novel by Russian writer Yevgeny Zamyatin (often anglicised as Eugene Zamiatin) that was written in 1920–1921. It was first published as an English translation by Gregory Zilboorg in 1924 by E. P. Dutton in New York, with the original Russian text first published in 1952. The novel describes a world of harmony and conformity within a united totalitarian state that is rebelled against by the protagonist, D-503 (). It influenced the emergence of dystopia as a literary genre. George Orwell said that Aldous Huxley&#x27;s 1931 &quot;Brave New World&quot; must be partly derived from &quot;We&quot;, although Huxley denied this. Orwell&#x27;s own &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; (1949) and &quot;Animal Farm&quot; was also inspired by &quot;We&quot;. &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; was also inspired by &quot;We&quot;.

== Setting ==
&quot;We&quot; is set in the far future. D-503, a spacecraft engineer, lives in the One State, an urban nation constructed almost entirely of glass (presumably to assist with mass surveillance). The structure of the state is Panopticon-like, and life is based upon F. W. Taylor&#x27;s principles of scientific management. Society is run centrally by a central power known as the Benefactor, and is run according to a strict timetable—people march in step with each other and are uniformed. There is no way of referring to people except by their given designations (referred to as &#x27;numbers&#x27; in the novel.) The society in which &quot;We&quot; is set uses mathematical logic and reason for its scheduling and as justification for its actions. The individual&#x27;s behaviour is based on logic by way of formulae and equations outlined by the One State.

== Plot ==
A few hundred years after the One State&#x27;s conquest of the entire world, the spaceship &quot;INTEGRAL&quot; is being built in order to invade and conquer extraterrestrial planets. The project&#x27;s chief engineer, D-503, begins a journal that he intends to be carried upon the completed spaceship. The book is this journal—it titles chapters as &#x27;[n]th Entry&#x27; and begins each entry with three lines of notes summarising the events therein.

Like all other citizens of the One State, D-503 lives in a glass apartment building and is carefully watched by the secret police, or Bureau of Guardians. D-503&#x27;s lover, O-90, has been assigned by the One State to visit him on certain nights. She is considered too short to bear children and is deeply grieved by that status. O-90&#x27;s other lover and D-503&#x27;s best friend is R-13, a State poet who reads his verse at public executions.

While on an assigned walk with O-90, D-503 meets a woman named I-330. I-330 smokes cigarettes, drinks alcohol and shamelessly flirts with D-503 instead of applying for an impersonal sex visit; all of these are illegal according to the laws of the One State.

Repelled and fascinated, D-503 struggles to overcome his attraction to I-330. She invites him to visit the Ancient House, notable for being the only opaque building in the One State, except for windows. Objects of aesthetic and historical importance dug up from around the city are stored there. There, I-330 offers him the services of a corrupt doctor to explain his absence from work. Leaving in horror, D-503 vows to denounce her to the Bureau of Guardians but finds that he cannot.

D-503 begins to have dreams, which disturb him, as dreams are thought to be a symptom of mental illness. Slowly, I-330 reveals to D-503 that she is involved with the Mephi, an organization plotting to bring down the One State. She takes him through secret tunnels inside the Ancient House to the world outside the Green Wall, which surrounds the city-state. There, D-503 meets the inhabitants of the outside world: humans whose bodies are covered with animal fur. The aims of the Mephi are to destroy the Green Wall and reunite the citizens of the One State with the outside world.

Despite the recent rift between them, O-90 pleads with D-503 to impregnate her illegally. After O-90 insists that she will obey the law by turning over their child to be raised by the One State, D-503 obliges. During the pregnancy, O-90 realizes that she cannot bear to be parted from her baby. At D-503&#x27;s request, I-330 arranges for O-90 to be smuggled outside the Green Wall.

In his last journal entry, D-503 indifferently relates that he has been forcibly tied to a table and subjected to the &quot;Great Operation&quot;, which has recently been mandated for all citizens of the One State to prevent possible riots; having been psycho-surgically refashioned into a state of mechanical &quot;reliability&quot;, they would now function as &quot;tractors in human form&quot;. This operation removes the imagination and emotions by targeting parts of the brain with X-rays. After this operation, D-503 willingly informed the Benefactor, the dictator of the One State, about the inner workings of the Mephi. I-330 is then brought to an interrogation chamber, and subjected to torture by suffocation; D-503 expresses surprise that even torture could not induce I-330 to denounce her comrades. Despite her refusal, I-330 and those arrested with her have been sentenced to death, &quot;under the Benefactor&#x27;s Machine&quot;.

The Mephi uprising gathers strength; parts of the Green Wall have been destroyed, birds are repopulating the city and people start committing acts of social rebellion. Although D-503 expresses hope that the Benefactor shall restore &quot;reason&quot;, the novel ends with the One State&#x27;s survival in doubt. I-330&#x27;s mantra is that, just as there is no highest number, there can be no &quot;final&quot; revolution.

== Major themes ==

=== Dystopian society ===

The dystopian society depicted in &quot;We&quot; is presided over by the Benefactor and is surrounded by a giant Green Wall to separate the citizens from primitive untamed nature. All citizens are known as &quot;numbers&quot;. Every hour in one&#x27;s life is directed by the &quot;Table of Hours&quot;. The action of &quot;We&quot; is set at some time after the Two Hundred Years&#x27; War, which has wiped out all but &quot;0.2 [20%] of the earth&#x27;s population&quot;. The war was over a rare substance only mentioned in the book through a metaphor; the substance was called &quot;bread&quot; as the &quot;Christians gladiated over it&quot;—as in Christians killed for sport in Roman gladiator games as a form of entertainment, &quot;bread and circuses&quot;, suggesting a war that was meant to distract the population from a power grab by the government. The war only ended after the use of weapons of mass destruction, so that the One State is surrounded with a post-apocalyptic landscape.

===Allusions and references===

Many of the names and numbers in &quot;We&quot; are allusions to the experiences of Zamyatin or to culture and literature. &quot;Auditorium 112&quot; refers to cell number 112, where Zamyatin was twice imprisoned and the name of S-4711 is a reference to the Eau de Cologne number 4711. Zamyatin, who worked as a naval architect, refers to the specifications of the icebreaker &quot;St. Alexander Nevsky&quot;.

The numbers [.. .] of the chief characters in WE are taken directly from the specifications of Zamyatin&#x27;s favourite icebreaker, the Saint Alexander Nevsky, yard no. A/W 905, round tonnage 3300, where O–90 and I-330 appropriately divide the hapless D-503 [.. .] Yu-10 could easily derive from the Swan Hunter yard numbers of no fewer than three of Zamyatin&#x27;s major icebreakers – 1012, 1020, 1021 [.. .]. R-13 can be found here too, as well as in the yard number of &quot;Sviatogor&quot; A/W 904.
Many comparisons to The Bible exist in &quot;We&quot;. There are similarities between Genesis Chapters 1–4 and &quot;We&quot;, where the One State is considered Paradise, D-503 is Adam and I-330 is Eve. The snake in this piece is S-4711, who is described as having a bent and twisted form, with a &quot;double-curved body&quot;; he is a double agent. References to Mephistopheles (in the Mephi) are seen as allusions to Satan and his rebellion against Heaven in the Bible (Ezekiel 28:11–19; Isaiah 14:12–15). The novel can be considered a criticism of organised religion given this interpretation. Zamyatin, influenced by Fyodor Dostoyevsky&#x27;s &quot;Notes from Underground&quot; and &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;, made the novel a criticism of the excesses of a militantly atheistic society. The novel displayed an indebtedness to H. G. Wells&#x27;s dystopia &quot;When the Sleeper Wakes&quot; (1899).

The novel uses mathematical concepts symbolically. The spaceship that D-503 is supervising the construction of is called the &quot;Integral&quot;, which he hopes will &quot;integrate the grandiose cosmic equation&quot;. D-503 also mentions that he is profoundly disturbed by the concept of the square root of −1—which is the basis for imaginary numbers, imagination having been deprecated by the One State. Zamyatin&#x27;s point, probably in light of the increasingly dogmatic Soviet government of the time, would seem to be that it is impossible to remove all the rebels against a system. Zamyatin even says this through I-330, &quot;There is no final revolution. Revolutions are infinite&quot;.

== Literary significance and influences ==
Along with Jack London&#x27;s &quot;The Iron Heel&quot;, &quot;We&quot; is generally considered to be the grandfather of the satirical futuristic dystopia genre. It takes the modern industrial society to an extreme conclusion, depicting a state that believes that free will is the cause of unhappiness, and that citizens&#x27; lives should be controlled with mathematical precision based on the system of industrial efficiency created by Frederick Winslow Taylor. The Soviet attempt at implementing Taylorism, led by Aleksei Gastev, may have immediately influenced Zamyatin&#x27;s portrayal of the One State. In Russia, a dystopian totalitarian society before Zamyatin was described by Mikhail Saltykov in his satirical novel &quot;The History of a Town&quot;, and Saltykov&#x27;s idea of &quot;Utopia of the straight line&quot; continues in &quot;We&quot;: &quot;To unbend the wild curve, to straighten it out to a tangent — to a straight line!&quot;

Christopher Collins in &quot;Evgenij Zamjatin: An Interpretive Study&quot; finds the many intriguing literary aspects of &quot;We&quot; more interesting and relevant today than the political aspects:

# An examination of myth and symbol reveals that the work may be better understood as an internal drama of a conflicted modern man rather than as a representation of external reality in a failed utopia. The city is laid out as a mandala, populated with archetypes and subject to an archetypal conflict. One wonders if Zamyatin were familiar with the theories of his contemporary C. G. Jung or whether it is a case here of the common European zeitgeist.
# Much of the cityscape and expressed ideas in the world of &quot;We&quot; are taken almost directly from the works of H. G. Wells, a popular apostle of scientific socialist utopia whose works Zamyatin had edited in Russian.
# In the use of color and other imagery Zamyatin shows he was influenced by Kandinsky and other European Expressionist painters.

The little-known Russian dystopian novel &quot;Love in the Fog of the Future&quot;, published in 1924 by Andrei Marsov, has also been compared to &quot;We&quot;.

George Orwell claimed that Aldous Huxley&#x27;s &quot;Brave New World&quot; (1932) must be partly derived from &quot;We&quot;. However, in a letter to Christopher Collins in 1962, Huxley says that he wrote &quot;Brave New World&quot; as a reaction to H. G. Wells&#x27;s utopias long before he had heard of &quot;We&quot;.

Kurt Vonnegut said that in writing &quot;Player Piano&quot; (1952), he &quot;cheerfully ripped off the plot of &quot;Brave New World&quot;, whose plot had been cheerfully ripped off from Yevgeny Zamyatin&#x27;s &quot;We&quot;&quot;. Ayn Rand&#x27;s &quot;Anthem&quot; (1938) has many significant similarities to &quot;We&quot; (detailed here), although it is stylistically and thematically different. Vladimir Nabokov&#x27;s novel &quot;Invitation to a Beheading&quot; may suggest a dystopian society with some similarities to Zamyatin&#x27;s; Nabokov read &quot;We&quot; while writing &quot;Invitation to a Beheading&quot;.

Orwell began &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; (1949) some eight months after he read &quot;We&quot; in a French translation and wrote a review of it. Orwell is reported as &quot;saying that he was taking it as the model for his next novel&quot;. Brown writes that for Orwell and certain others, &quot;We&quot; &quot;appears to have been &quot;the&quot; crucial literary experience&quot;. Shane states that &quot;Zamyatin&#x27;s influence on Orwell is beyond dispute&quot;. Robert Russell, in an overview of the criticism of &quot;We&quot;, concludes that &quot;&quot;1984&quot; shares so many features with &quot;We&quot; that there can be no doubt about its general debt to it&quot;; but that there is a minority of critics who view the similarities between &quot;We&quot; and &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; as &quot;entirely superficial&quot;. Further, Russell finds that &quot;Orwell&#x27;s novel is both bleaker and more topical than Zamyatin&#x27;s, lacking entirely that ironic humour that pervades the Russian work&quot;.

In &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; (1979), Tom Wolfe describes &quot;We&quot; as a &quot;marvelously morose novel of the future&quot; featuring an &quot;omnipotent spaceship&quot; called the &quot;Integral&quot; whose &quot;designer is known only as &#x27;D-503, Builder of the Integral&#x27;&quot;. Wolfe goes on to use the &quot;Integral&quot; as a metaphor for the Soviet launch vehicle, the Soviet space programme, or the Soviet Union.

Jerome K. Jerome has been cited as an influence on Zamyatin&#x27;s novel. Jerome&#x27;s short story &quot;The New Utopia&quot; (1891) describes a regimented future city, indeed world, of nightmarish egalitarianism, where men and women are barely distinguishable in their grey uniforms (Zamyatin&#x27;s &quot;unifs&quot;) and all have short black hair, natural or dyed. No one has a name: women wear even numbers on their tunics, and men wear odd, just as in &quot;We&quot;. Equality is taken to such lengths that people with well-developed physiques are liable to have lopped limbs. In Zamyatin, similarly, the equalisation of noses is earnestly proposed. Jerome has anyone with an overactive imagination subjected to a levelling-down operation—something of central importance in &quot;We&quot;. There is a shared depiction by both Jerome and Zamyatin that individual and, by extension, familial love is a disruptive and humanizing force. Jerome&#x27;s works were translated in Russia three times before 1917.

In 1998, the first English translation of &quot;Cursed Days&quot;, a diary kept in secret in 1918-20 by anti-communist Russian author Ivan Bunin during the Russian Civil War in Moscow and Odessa was published in Chicago. In a foreword, the diary&#x27;s English translator, Thomas Gaiton Marullo, described &quot;Cursed Days&quot; as a rare example of dystopian nonfiction and pointed out multiple parallels between the secret diary kept by Bunin and the diary kept by D-503.

== Publication history ==

Zamyatin&#x27;s literary position deteriorated throughout the 1920s, and he was eventually allowed to emigrate to Paris in 1931, probably after the intercession of Maxim Gorky.

The novel was first published in English in 1924 by E. P. Dutton in New York in a translation by Gregory Zilboorg, but its first publication in the Soviet Union had to wait until 1988, when glasnost resulted in it appearing alongside George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;. A year later, &quot;We&quot; and &quot;Brave New World&quot; were published together in a combined edition.

In 1994, the novel received a Prometheus Award in the &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; category.

== Adaptations ==

=== Films ===

The German TV network ZDF adapted the novel for a TV movie in 1982, under the German title &quot;Wir&quot; (English: We).

&quot;We&quot; is heavily referenced in the 2023 sci-fi feature film &quot;1984&quot;.

The novel has also been adapted, by Alain Bourret, a French director, into a short film called &quot;The Glass Fortress&quot; (2016). &quot;The Glass Fortress&quot; is an experimental film that employs a technique known as still image film, and is shot in black-and-white, which help support the grim atmosphere of the story&#x27;s dystopian society. The film is technically similar to &quot;La Jetée&quot; (1962), directed by Chris Marker, and refers somewhat to &quot;THX 1138&quot; (1971), by George Lucas, in the &quot;religious appearance of the Well Doer&quot;. According to film critic Isabelle Arnaud, &quot;The Glass Fortress&quot; has a special atmosphere underlining a story of thwarted love that will be long remembered.

A Russian film adaptation, directed by Hamlet Dulyan and starring Egor Koreshkov, initially planned for release in 2021, was released in 2024.

=== Radio ===
A two-part adaptation by Sean O&#x27;Brien and directed by Jim Poyser was broadcast on 18 and 25 April 2004 on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Classic Serial&quot;. The cast included Anton Lesser as D-503, Joanna Riding as I-330, Julia Routhwaite as O-90, Brigit Forsyth as U, Patrick Bridgeman as S and Don Warrington as R-13.

=== Theatre ===
The Montreal company Théâtre Deuxième Réalité produced an adaptation of the novel in 1996, adapted and directed by Alexandre Marine, under the title &quot;Nous Autres&quot;.

=== Music ===
Released in 2015, &quot;The Glass Fortress&quot; is a musical and narrative adaptation of the novel by Rémi Orts Project and Alan B.

In 2022, the Canadian indie rock band Arcade Fire released &quot;We&quot;, an album whose title was inspired by the novel.

=== Other ===
In 2022, independent creator Doug Strain produced Beyond the Green Wall, a Dungeons and Dragons adventure based on the novel.

<text>Body Glove is an American brand of watersports apparel and accessories that was founded in 1953 by twin brothers Bill and Bob Meistrell. The brothers are often credited with inventing the first practical wetsuit in the early 1950s at the back of their Redondo Beach, California surf shop, Dive N&#x27; Surf. From those wetsuits, Body Glove branched out into other product categories. They now make wetsuits, swimsuits, clothing, shoes, life vests, sunglasses, wakeboards, paddle boards, towables, backpacks, phone cases and snorkeling equipment.

==History==
Body Glove was started by identical twins Bill and Bob Meistrell in Redondo Beach, CA. They were raised in Boonville, Missouri and moved to Manhattan Beach, CA in 1944. They were always interested in the water and even crafted a rudimentary diving helmet out of an oil can, tar, glass and a bicycle pump so that they could explore a pond on their family farm. When they moved to Manhattan Beach, they fell even more in love with the water. They both were on their high school swim team and became interested in surfing and diving. They became certified Los Angeles County Lifeguards.

Bill and Bob borrowed $1800 from their mother and each bought one third of the local sports shop called Dive N&#x27; Surf, owned then by surfboard shaper Hap Jacobs and dive entrepreneur Bev Morgan. Because the water was cold in the winter, they needed to find a way to stay in the water longer. In 1953, Bill Meistrell went to Bedford, Virginia, where he found the insulation used in the back of refrigerators, neoprene, and the first practical wetsuit was born. The Meistrells designed and tailored their own brand of wetsuits. In the beginning, the wetsuits were named the Dive N Surf Thermocline. The Meistrells did not think this was a great name, so they hired a marketing consultant, Duke Boyd. He asked about the characteristics of the suits, and Bill said &quot;They fit like a glove,&quot; so Boyd came up with the name Body Glove.

The business stayed in the Meistrell family for three generations. There are five 2nd-generation Meistrells: Billy, Julie, Robbie, Ronnie and Randy. There are 13 3rd-generation Meistrells, two of whom still work for the company: Nick Meistrell and Jenna Meistrell. The company continues to make products for the active outdoor enthusiast.

In 2016 Marquee Brands acquired a 75% ownership stake in Body Glove, with the Meistrell family retaining 25% of the company.

<doc id="234557" wikidata="Q1638008" url="?curid=234557" title="Leptocephalus">
<text>A leptocephalus (meaning &quot;slim head&quot;) is the flat and transparent larva of the eel, marine eels, and other members of the superorder Elopomorpha. This is one of the most diverse groups of teleosts, containing 801 species in 4 orders, 24 families, and 156 genera. This group is thought to have arisen in the Cretaceous period over 140 million years ago. 

Fishes with a leptocephalus larval stage include the most familiar eels such as the conger, moray eel, and garden eel as well as members of the family Anguillidae, plus more than 10 other families of lesser-known types of marine eels. These are all true eels of the order Anguilliformes. Leptocephali of eight species of eels from the South Atlantic Ocean were described by Meyer-Rochow 

The fishes of the other four traditional orders of elopomorph fishes that have this type of larvae are more diverse in their body forms and include the tarpon, bonefish, spiny eel, pelican eel and deep sea species like &quot;Cyema atrum&quot; and notacanthidae species, the latter with giant Leptocephalus-like larvae.

==Description==
Leptocephali (singular leptocephalus) all have laterally compressed bodies that contain transparent jelly-like substances on the inside of the body and a thin layer of muscle with visible myomeres on the outside. Their body organs are small and they have only a simple tube for a gut. This combination of features results in them being very transparent when they are alive. Leptocephali have dorsal and anal fins confluent with caudal fins, but lack pelvic fins. 

They also lack red blood cells until they begin to metamorphose into the juvenile glass eel stage when they start to look like eels. Leptocephali are also characterized by their fang-like teeth that are present until metamorphosis, when they are lost.

Leptocephali differ from most fish larvae because they grow to much larger sizes and have long larval periods of about three months to more than a year. Another distinguishing feature of these organisms is their mucinous pouch. They move with typical anguilliform swimming motions and can swim forwards and backwards. Their food source was difficult to determine because zooplankton, which are the typical food of fish larvae, were never seen in their guts.

Leptocephali appear to feed on tiny particles floating freely in the ocean, which are often referred to as marine snow. Leptocephali larvae live primarily in the upper of the ocean at night, and often a little deeper during the day. Leptocephali are present worldwide in the oceans from southern temperate to tropical latitudes, where adult eels and their close relatives live. American eels, European eels, conger eels, and some oceanic species spawn and are found in the Sargasso Sea.

&quot;Leptocephalus brevirostris&quot; was declared as a biological species in 1856, but was later found to be the larva of &quot;Anguilla anguilla&quot;, which was declared by Linnaeus in 1758 and thus has priority.

==Development==
The eggs of eels in the order Anguilliformes are quite large compared to those of many other fishes. They are about in diameter. Once the larvae are newly hatched, the yolk extends posteriorly. Some larvae hatch with features of the head more developed than others. The preleptocephalus stage is the period immediately after the larvae hatch. During this stage, the larvae do not yet feed externally. These larvae typically have poorly developed eyes and few or no teeth.

The leptocephalus stage of the larvae begins after the nutrients from the yolk have been absorbed and the eyes and teeth are formed. At this point, the larvae usually have long forward-facing pointy teeth. As the larvae grow larger, the teeth will be replaced by shorter teeth and will increase in number. The maximum size larvae reach varies from about but can be as large as or more depending on the species. After the leptocephali have reached their maximum size, they enter their glass eel stage. Their laterally compressed bodies tend to become more rounded in this stage. The head also thickens, the olfactory organ enlarges, and their teeth are lost.

Leptocephali differ from other fish larvae in their development. In other teleosts (those without leptocephali), the egg hatches and then the larvae get nutrients from a yolk sac. Following this, external feeding begins once the yolk sac has depleted. The larvae begin to increase in size and develop into a juvenile fish once external feeding begins. In those fish with a leptocephalus stage; however, after hatching and obtaining nutrients from the yolk, the larvae do not begin external feeding. This is peculiar because the larvae still continue to grow in size. From this information, it is concluded that one of the biggest and most basic differences in the developmental cycles of teleosts without leptocephali and teleosts with leptocephali is the food source that the larvae use.

Leptocephali are poorly understood, partly because they are very fragile and eat particulate material instead of zooplankton, and their good swimming ability lets them avoid most standard-sized plankton nets used by marine biologists. A video recording of a naturally swimming leptocephalus filmed at night off the island of Hawaii shows an example of their swimming behavior.

==Visual system==
Two facts are known regarding the visual system of the leptocephali. The first is that they have a rod-dominated visual system. The second is that the Synaphobranchidae (a specific family of leptocephali) have telescopic eyes, meaning a tubular eye with a sphere-shaped lens on the top occurs.

==Aquaculture==
Some progress has been made to grow the leptocephali of the Japanese eel in the laboratory. The goal of that effort is to produce glass eels through artificial spawning and larval rearing, to be used for aquaculture to produce unagi for food. Unagi is a popular food in Japan and East Asia. Due to the strange nature of the leptocephali, this has not been easy. Trying to artificially recreate marine snow has proven difficult for scientists. 

Leptocephali are rarely used as food, except in some parts of Japan. The leptocephali of the common Japanese conger, &quot;Conger myriaster&quot;, are called noresore· in Kōchi Prefecture, Japan, and are often served uncooked to the table, and are eaten after dipping in &quot;tosazu&quot; mixed vinegar. It is a spring seasonal specialty.

He was the founder of the Kyoto School of historiography, and along with Shiratori Kurakichi (the founder of the Tokyo School), was one of the leading Japanese historians of East Asia in the early twentieth century. His most well-known book is called &quot;Nara&quot;.

== Biography ==
He was born in what is today Akita Prefecture. He distinguished himself as a journalist. In 1907 he discovered Manwen Laodang in Mukden. As an authority of Chinese history, he was invited to Kyoto Imperial University by Kano Kokichi in 1907 and got involved in the foundation of the Department of Oriental History.

Naitō&#x27;s most influential contribution to historiography was the recognition and analysis of the &quot;Tang-Song transition&quot; as an important watershed. He argued that the social, political, demographic and economic changes that occurred between the mid-Tang dynasty and early Song dynasty represented the transition between the medieval (&quot;chūsei&quot;) and early modern (&quot;kinsei&quot;) periods of Chinese history.

In Japanese history, Naitō argued that Yamataikoku was located in Kyūshū rather than in Kinki.

<text>Bullet time (also known as frozen moment, dead time, flow motion or time slice) is a visual effect or visual impression of detaching the time and space of a camera (or viewer) from that of its visible subject. It is a depth enhanced simulation of variable-speed action and performance found in films, broadcast advertisements, and realtime graphics within video games and other special media. It is characterized by its extreme transformation of both time (slow enough to show normally imperceptible and unfilmable events, such as flying bullets), and of space (by way of the ability of the camera angle—the audience&#x27;s point-of-view—to move around the scene at a normal speed while events are slowed). This is almost impossible with conventional slow motion, as the physical camera would have to move implausibly fast; the concept implies that only a &quot;virtual camera&quot;, often illustrated within the confines of a computer-generated environment such as a virtual world or virtual reality, would be capable of &quot;filming&quot; bullet-time types of moments. Technical and historical variations of this effect have been referred to as time slicing, view morphing, &quot;temps mort&quot; (French: &quot;dead time&quot;) and virtual cinematography.

The term &quot;bullet time&quot; was first used with reference to the 1999 film &quot;The Matrix&quot;, and later in reference to the slow motion effects in the 2001 video game &quot;Max Payne&quot;. In the years since the introduction of the term via the &quot;Matrix&quot; films it has become a commonly applied expression in popular culture.

== History ==

The technique of using a group of still cameras to freeze motion occurred before the invention of cinema itself with preliminary work by Eadweard Muybridge on chronophotography. In &quot;The Horse in Motion&quot; (1878), Muybridge analyzed the motion of a galloping horse by using a line of cameras to photograph the animal as it ran past. Eadweard Muybridge used still cameras placed along a racetrack, and each camera was actuated by a taut string stretched across the track; as the horse galloped past, the camera shutters snapped, taking one frame at a time. Muybridge later assembled the pictures into a rudimentary animation, by having them traced onto a glass disk, rotating in a type of magic lantern with a stroboscopic shutter. This zoopraxiscope may have been an inspiration for Thomas Edison to explore the idea of motion pictures. In 1878–1879, Muybridge made dozens of studies of foreshortenings of horses and athletes with five cameras capturing the same moment from different positions. For his studies with the University of Pennsylvania, published as &quot;Animal Locomotion&quot; (1887), Muybridge also took photos from six angles at the same instant, as well as series of 12 phases from three angles.

A debt may also be owed to MIT professor Harold Edgerton, who, in the 1940s, captured now-iconic photos of bullets using xenon strobe lights to &quot;freeze&quot; motion.

Bullet-time as a concept was frequently developed in cel animation. One of the earliest examples is the shot at the end of the title sequence for the 1966 Japanese anime series &quot;Speed Racer&quot;: as Speed leaps from the Mach Five, he freezes in mid-jump, and then the &quot;camera&quot; does an arc shot from front to sideways.

In 1980, Tim Macmillan started producing pioneering film and later, video, in this field while studying for a BA at the (then named) Bath Academy of Art using 16mm film arranged in a progressing circular arrangement of pinhole cameras. They were the first iteration of the Time-Slice&#x27; Motion-Picture Array Cameras&quot; which he developed in the early 1990s when still cameras for the array capable of high image quality for broadcast and movie applications became available. In 1997 he founded Time-Slice Films Ltd. (UK). He applied the technique to his artistic practice in a video projection, titled &quot;Dead Horse&quot; in an ironic reference to Muybridge, that was exhibited at the London Electronic Arts Gallery in 1998 and in 2000 was nominated for the Citibank Prize for photography.

Another precursor of the bullet-time technique was &quot;Midnight Mover&quot;, a 1985 Accept video. In this video, Academy Award winning special effects director Zbigniew Rybczynski mounted thirteen 16mm film cameras on a specially constructed hexagonal rig that encircled the performers. The resulting footage was meticulously edited to create the illusion of the band members spinning in place while moving in real time. In the 1990s, a morphing-based variation on time-slicing was employed by director Michel Gondry and the visual effects company BUF Compagnie in the music video for The Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Like A Rolling Stone&quot;, and in a 1996 Smirnoff commercial the effect was used to depict slow-motion bullets being dodged. Similar time-slice effects were also featured in commercials for The Gap (which was directed by M. Rolston and again produced by BUF), and in feature films such as &quot;Lost in Space&quot; (1998) and &quot;Buffalo &#x27;66&quot; (1998) and the television program &quot;The Human Body&quot;.

It is well-established for feature films&#x27; action scenes to be depicted using slow-motion footage, for example the gunfights in &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; (directed by Sam Peckinpah) and the heroic bloodshed films of John Woo. Subsequently, the 1998 film &quot;Blade&quot; featured a scene that used computer-generated bullets and slow-motion footage to illustrate characters&#x27; superhuman bullet-dodging reflexes. The 1999 film &quot;The Matrix&quot; combined these elements (gunfight action scenes, superhuman bullet-dodging, and time-slice effects), popularizing both the effect and the term &quot;bullet-time&quot;. &quot;The Matrix&quot; version of the effect was created by John Gaeta and Manex Visual Effects. Rigs of still cameras were set up in patterns determined by simulations, and then shot either simultaneously (producing an effect similar to previous time-slice scenes) or sequentially (which added a temporal element to the effect). Interpolation effects, digital compositing, and computer-generated &quot;virtual&quot; scenery were used to improve the fluidity of the apparent camera motion. Gaeta said of &quot;The Matrix&quot; use of the effect:

For artistic inspiration for bullet time, I would credit Otomo Katsuhiro, who co-wrote and directed &quot;Akira&quot;, which definitely blew me away, along with director Michel Gondry. His music videos experimented with a different type of technique called view-morphing and it was just part of the beginning of uncovering the creative approaches toward using still cameras for special effects. Our technique was significantly different because we built it to move around objects that were themselves in motion, and we were also able to create slow-motion events that &#x27;virtual cameras&#x27; could move around – rather than the static action in Gondry&#x27;s music videos with limited camera moves.

Following &quot;The Matrix&quot;, bullet time and other slow-motion effects were featured as key gameplay mechanics in various video games. While some games like Cyclone Studios&#x27; &quot;&quot;, released in March 1999, featured slow-motion effects, Remedy Entertainment&#x27;s 2001 video game &quot;Max Payne&quot; is considered to be the first true implementation of a bullet-time effect that enables the player to have added limited control (such as aiming and shooting) during the slow-motion mechanic; this mechanic was explicitly called &quot;Bullet Time&quot; in the game. The mechanic is also used extensively in the &quot;F.E.A.R.&quot; series, combining it with squad-based enemy design encouraging the player to use bullet time to avoid being overwhelmed.

Bullet time was used for the first time in a live music environment in October 2009 for Creed&#x27;s live DVD &quot;Creed Live&quot;.

The popular science television program, &quot;Time Warp&quot;, used high speed camera techniques to examine everyday occurrences and singular talents, including breaking glass, bullet trajectories and their impact effects.

== Technology ==

The bullet time effect was originally achieved photographically by a set of still cameras surrounding the subject. The cameras are fired sequentially, or all at the same time, depending on the desired effect. Single frames from each camera are then arranged and displayed consecutively to produce an orbiting viewpoint of an action frozen in time or as hyper-slow-motion. This technique suggests the limitless perspectives and variable frame rates possible with a virtual camera. However, if the still array process is done with real cameras, it is often limited to assigned paths.

In &quot;The Matrix&quot;, the camera path was pre-designed using computer-generated visualizations as a guide. Cameras were arranged, behind a green or blue screen, on a track and aligned through a laser targeting system, forming a complex curve through space. The cameras were then triggered at extremely close intervals, so the action continued to unfold, in extreme slow-motion, while the viewpoint moved. Additionally, the individual frames were scanned for computer processing. Using sophisticated interpolation software, extra frames could be inserted to slow down the action further and improve the fluidity of the movement (especially the frame rate of the images); frames could also be dropped to speed up the action. This approach provides greater flexibility than a purely photographic one. The same effect can also be simulated using pure CGI, motion capture and other approaches.

Bullet time evolved further through &quot;The Matrix&quot; series with the introduction of high-definition computer-generated approaches like virtual cinematography and universal capture. Universal capture, a machine vision guided system, was the first ever motion picture deployment of an array of high definition cameras focused on a common human subject (actor, Neo) in order to create a volumetric photography. Like the concept of bullet time, the subject could be viewed from any angle yet, at the same time, the depth based media could be recomposed as well as spatially integrated within computer-generated constructs. It moved past a visual concept of a virtual camera to becoming an actual virtual camera. Virtual elements within the Matrix Trilogy utilized state-of-the-art image-based computer rendering techniques pioneered in Paul Debevec&#x27;s 1997 film &quot;The Campanile&quot; and custom evolved for &quot;The Matrix&quot; by George Borshukov, an early collaborator of Debevec. Inspiration aside, virtual camera methodologies pioneered within the &quot;Matrix&quot; trilogy have been often credited as fundamentally contributing to capture approaches required for emergent virtual reality and other immersive experience platforms.

For many years, it has been possible to use computer vision techniques to capture scenes and render images of novel viewpoints sufficient for bullet time type effects. More recently, these have been formalized into what is becoming known as free viewpoint television (FTV). At the time of &quot;The Matrix&quot;, FTV was not a fully mature technology. FTV is effectively the live action version of bullet time, without the slow motion.

<text>The Sarpo Laggo Glacier (, &quot;Sarpo Laggo&quot;: &#x27;young husband&#x27;) is a glacier in the autonomous region Xinjiang of China, in the Karakoram mountain range of the Himalayas. 
== Geography ==
Sarpo Laggo Glacier lies north of the Baltoro Muztagh range. It could be reached from the Baltoro glacier on the Pakistani side of the Karakorams via the &quot;Old Muztagh Pass&quot; northeast of the Trango Towers. It is, however, easier to approach the glacier from the Chinese side, starting a long hike at Kashgar on the Karakoram Highway and finally passing K2&#x27;s northern base camp.
The glacier is named after Francis Younghusband, who was the first person to pass the Old Mustagh Pass and thus enter the Sarpo Laggo region. There is another glacier not far away, also named after him: Younghusband glacier (also known as Biango glacier) flows from Muztagh Tower towards the Baltoro Glacier.

<text>The , also known as the &quot;Yumekamome&quot; (), is one of two lines of the Kobe Municipal Subway. Trains of the line are propelled by linear motors. This is the third linear motor rapid transit line to be built in Japan.

== History ==
Construction of the line began in 1994 but was interrupted by the Great Hanshin earthquake which hit Kobe in 1995. Despite the cross section of the tunnels being smaller compared to a conventional subway tunnel, there was still a substantial amount of construction happening at surface level. 

After being scheduled for a 1999 opening, revenue service began in 2001. 

Since opening, ridership numbers have stagnated. The projected ridership within 2001 was estimated to be 80,000 boardings, the actual boardings recorded were just over 34,000 in that year. The goal of 50,000 boardings by 2020 was also not achieved. As a result, the line has accumulated a deficit of over over 20 years of operation as of 2021.

== Operation ==
The line is long and runs between Shin-Nagata Station in the west to Sannomiya-Hanadokeimae Station in the east. 

The maximum grade on the line is 50‰.

==Stations==
== Rolling stock ==
* 5000 series (since 2001)

All trains are based at Misaki-Kōen Depot.

<text>The is a Japanese third-sector railway that connects Hyōgo, Okayama and Tottori prefectures. The Chizu Line is not electrified, but is a high-grade railroad, and extends a total of . The limited expresses &quot;Super Hakuto&quot; and &quot;Super Inaba&quot; operate on this line.

== Chizu Express Chizu Line ==
Some local trains operate through from the JR West Inbi Line (Tottori - Chizu).
==History==
Construction of the line was approved under the Railway Construction Act in 1922, and commenced by Japanese National Railways (JNR) in June 1966. Work was well advanced when a freeze on expenditure in 1980 resulted in construction being halted with 95% of the route acquired and 93% of the earthworks completed.

The Tottori Prefectural Government facilitated the establishment of the Chizu Express Company in May 1986, which resumed construction.

The line opened on December 3, 1994, and includes the 5,592 m Shitozaka tunnel.

From November 29, 1997, the JR limited express &quot;Super Inaba&quot; service commenced between Okayama and Tottori.

<text>is a railway station in Chūō-ku, Kobe, Japan, operated by West Japan Railway Company (JR West). Although Kobe Station is the namesake of the city of Kobe, Kobe City Hall and the commercial center of Kobe is closer to Kobe-Sannomiya Station.

==Lines==
The station technically forms the end point of the Tokaido Main Line and the starting of the Sanyo Main Line. This fact is barely discernible in current practice because only a few trains originate or terminate at Kobe; as a result, the station is more commonly perceived as being in the midsection of the JR Kobe Line, an alternative name for the section of the Tokaido and Sanyo lines between Osaka and Himeji.

==Layout==
The station has one side platform and two island platforms serving five elevated tracks.

===Platforms===


==Adjacent stations==




==History==
Kobe Station opened on 11 May 1874. With the privatization of JNR on 1 April 1987, the station came under the control of JR West.

Station numbering was introduced in March 2018 with Kobe being assigned station number JR-A63.

==Surrounding area==

The area to the south of the station was previously a freight yard, but was redeveloped and became a waterfront commercial center called Harborland.

Escalators and underground pathways link pedestrian traffic from the above-ground Kobe Station with the relatively close underground stations of Kosoku Kobe on the Kobe Rapid Railway and Harborland on the Kaigan Line of the Kobe Municipal Subway.

==In popular culture==

* The station is referred to in GaGaGa SP&#x27;s song of the same name, 「神戸駅」&quot;(Kōbe-eki)&quot;.

<doc id="234571" wikidata="Q26387" url="?curid=234571" title="European eel">
<text>The European eel (Anguilla anguilla) is a species of eel. Their life history was a mystery for thousands of years, and mating in the wild has not yet been observed. The five stages of their development were originally thought to be different species. They are critically endangered due to hydroelectric dams, overfishing by fisheries on coasts for human consumption, and parasites.

== Description ==
European eels live through 5 stages of development: larva (leptocephalus), glass eel, elver, yellow eel, and silver eel. Adults in the yellow phase are normally around and rarely reach more than , but can reach a length of up to in exceptional cases. In addition, they range from having 110 to 120 vertebrae. While European eels tend to live approximately 15–20 years in the wild, some captive specimens have lived for over 80 years. A specimen known as &quot;the Brantevik Eel&quot; lived for 155 years in the well of a family home in Brantevik, a fishing village in southern Sweden.

=== Ecology ===
Eels tend to range from underwater and after spawning in the Sargasso Sea, disperse North throughout the Atlantic Ocean, its coasts, and the rivers that empty into it. Feeding occurs mainly at night, via scent and prey consists of worms, fish (including ones too big to eat without biting off chunks), mollusks such as slugs, crustaceans such as crayfish, and plankton on occasion when available in large quantities. European eels are preyed upon by bigger eels, herons, cormorants, and pike. Seagulls also prey on elvers. Eels usually find and compete for shelter by hiding in plants or tube-shaped crevices in rocks. They also hide in muddy fields when inland.

== Conservation status ==

The European eel is a critically endangered species. Since the 1970s, the numbers of eels reaching Europe is thought to have declined by around 90% (possibly even 98%). Contributing factors include overfishing, parasites such as &quot;Anguillicola crassus&quot;, barriers to migration such as hydroelectric dams, and natural changes in the North Atlantic oscillation, Gulf Stream, and North Atlantic drift. Recent work suggests polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) pollution may be a factor in the decline. The TRAFFIC program is introducing traceability and legality systems throughout trade change to control and reverse the decline of the species. The species is listed in Appendix II of the CITES Convention. Hydroelectric dams have been shown to have a significant negative impact on eel populations. Over an 80 year period, waters with large dams have experienced almost twice the reduction of eel numbers as dam-free waters.

=== Sustainable consumption ===
Eels have been important sources of food both as adults (including jellied eels of East London) and as glass eels. Glass-eel fishing using basket traps has been of significant economic value in many river estuaries on the western seaboard of Europe. In addition, the United States imports 11 million pounds of eel every year to support its sushi industry, including European eels. In order to make eel consumption sustainable, in 2010, Greenpeace International added the European eel to its &quot;seafood red list&quot;, and the Sustainable Eel Group launched the Sustainable Eel Standard.

=== Breeding projects ===
As the European eel population has been falling for some time, several projects have been started. In 1997, Innovatie Netwerk in the Netherlands initiated a project where they attempted to get European eels to breed in captivity by simulating the journey from Europe to the Sargasso Sea with a swimming machine for the fish.

The first to achieve some success was DTU Aqua, a part of the Technical University of Denmark. Through a combination of fresh and salt water, as well as hormones, they were able to breed it in captivity in 2006 and make the larvae survive for 4.5 days after hatching. By 2007, DTU Aqua scientists were able to set a new record where the larvae survived for 12 days by feeding the mother eel with a special arginine-enriched diet. At this age the content of the larval yolk sac has been used, the mouth and digestive channel have developed, and it requires feeding. Attempts with various substances failed. Deep water sampling of the presumed habitat of larval European eel in the Sargasso Sea was performed by the Galathea 3 expedition in 2006–07, in the hope of revealing the likely feeding preference at the early stage. Their results indicated that they feed on various planktonic organisms, but especially microscopic jellyfish. A follow-up expedition was performed by DTU&#x27;s own research ship to the Sargasso Sea region in 2014.

To further the research, the PRO-EEL project, led by DTU Aqua and involving several research institutes elsewhere in Denmark (University of Copenhagen and others), Norway (Norwegian Institute of Fisheries and Food Research and others), the Netherlands (Leiden University and others), Belgium (Ghent University), France (French National Center for Scientific Research and others), Spain (ICTA at Polytechnic University of Valencia) and Tunisia (National Institute of Marine Sciences and Technologies), was started in 2010. By 2014, the eel larvae at their facilities typically survived 20–22 days, and by 2022 they were surviving up to around 140 days, well into the leptocephalus stage (the stage just before glass eel), but the full life cycle has still not been completed in captivity.

== Life history ==
Much of the European eel&#x27;s life history was a mystery for centuries, as fishermen never caught anything they could identify as a young eel. Unlike many other migrating fish, eels begin their life cycle in the ocean and spend most of their lives in fresh inland water, or brackish coastal water, returning to the ocean to spawn and then die. In the early 1900s, Danish researcher Johannes Schmidt identified the Sargasso Sea as the most likely spawning grounds for European eels. The larvae (leptocephali) drift towards Europe in a 300-day migration.

When approaching the European coast, the larvae metamorphose into a transparent larval stage called &quot;glass eel&quot;, enter estuaries, and many start migrating upstream. After entering their continental habitat, the glass eels metamorphose into elvers, miniature versions of the adult eels. As the eel grows, it becomes known as a &quot;yellow eel&quot; due to the brownish-yellow color of their sides and belly. After 5–20 years in fresh or brackish water, the eels become sexually mature, their eyes grow larger, their flanks become silver, and their bellies white in color. In this stage, the eels are known as &quot;silver eels&quot;, and they begin their migration back to the Sargasso Sea to spawn. Silvering is important in an eel&#x27;s development because it allows for increased levels of the steroid hormone cortisol, which is needed for their migration from fresh water back to the sea. Cortisol plays a role in the long migration because it allows for the mobilization of energy during migration. Also playing a key role in silvering is the production of the steroid 11-Ketotestosterone (11-KT), which prepares the eel for structural changes to the skin to endure the migration from fresh water to saltwater.

Sometimes the eel will never enter freshwater, and remain in their marine environment their entire life. Others grow up in brackish water, or migrate between saltwater, brackish water and freshwater several times in their lifetime.

Magnetoreception has also been reported in the European eel by at least one study, and may be used for navigation.


== Commercial fisheries ==

=== Production ===
The eel farming industry uses recirculating pools to raise glass eels taken from the wild for 8 months to 2 years until they mature enough for sale. Valliculture on coasts through the use of weirs is also utilized instead of recirculating pools for eel farming. New eels are quarantined to prevent disease spread and eels are sorted by size every couple weeks to prevent cannibalism and remove dead animals. A range of 23°C to 28°C is optimal for growth and protein based pellets and pastes are utilized as food sources for the eels after an initial few days of cod roe for the small glass ones. European eels typically have a feed conversion ratio (FCR) in the range of 1.8-2.5, although European fisheries are typically in the 1.6-1.7 range. Filters are essential for eliminating waste and ensuring the eels have clean water to live in. Eels are typically transported via road in tanks with water or via air in styrofoam boxes with a beaker of ice. The beakers keep condensation on the outside and ice on inside to keep the environment moist enough for the 1–3kg of eels to survive and also keep the temperature low enough.

=== Diseases/parasites in fisheries ===
Diseases can be spread rapidly in the highly populated environments of fisheries if quarantine measures are not taken immediately upon arrival of new eels. Some common bacterial infections observed in eel fisheries are red fin and red eel pest. When an eel has a red fin infection, its tail and fins start rotting, and a salt solution should be utilized to treat it. Antibiotics can be used to treat red eel pest which is characterized by ulcerated lesions, swelling, and spots of red on the skin of the eel. In addition, &quot;Aeromonas sobria&quot; and &quot;Streptococcus spp&quot;. are other more rare bacteria to infect European eels but have been observed in necropsies and are likely the result of other stresses increasing the eel&#x27;s susceptibility to disease, but can be treated with antimicrobials. Parasites such as from the genus &quot;Dactylogyrus&quot; have also been observed in necropsies, and some symptoms of parasitic infections in European eels are white spots, mucus increase, fin fraying, rubbing infected spots against the enclosure, respiratory distress, and lethargy. These parasites are best treated with salt solutions or formaldehyde solutions. Viral infections such as red head have also been observed; symptoms include red hemorrhaging spreading from the head to the rest of the eel and can be treated with vaccinations at a young age, salt solutions, or decreased temperature of water within the enclosure. Salt solutions also can treat fungal infections that cause swelling of gills and brown or white skin patches.

=== Industry ===
The exportation of European Eels has been restricted since 2010, yet on average 44% of eel sales in the United States consists of these eels. Eel aquaculture is most prominent in Japan, yet China, Scandinavia, Europe, Australia, Morocco, and Taiwan also participate in this practice. Eel breeding programs initiated by humans have been unsuccessful thus far and therefore the entire industry is dependent on the number of eels spawning in the wild, leaving it unsustainable and vulnerable to the factors causing European Eels to be critically endangered.

<text>Route 90 is a freeway in New Jersey in the United States (U.S.). The western terminus is at the Betsy Ross Bridge over the Delaware River in Pennsauken Township, Camden County, where the road continues into Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as an unnumbered road that provides access to Interstate 95 (I-95). The eastern terminus is an interchange with Route 73 in Cinnaminson Township, Burlington County. It is a four- to six-lane highway its entire length, interchanging with U.S. Route 130 (US 130) and County Route 644 (CR 644).

Route 90 was first proposed in 1964 a year after plans were made to build the Betsy Ross Bridge and was legislated in 1965 to run from the bridge to Route 73. The portion of the route between the Betsy Ross Bridge and US 130 was opened in 1976 while the portion from US 130 to Route 73 opened in 1988. When first proposed, Route 90 was planned to extend farther south to Route 73 in Mount Laurel, intersecting I-295 and the New Jersey Turnpike. There were other proposals that would have taken the freeway farther south to a planned Route 38 freeway, a planned US 30 freeway in Berlin, and possibly the Atlantic City Expressway. However, financial and environmental obstacles prevented any southern extension of Route 90. Across the Delaware River in Philadelphia, a freeway which was to be called the Pulaski Expressway and be designated Pennsylvania Route 90 (PA 90) was to have run from I-95 northwest to Roosevelt Boulevard (US 1). This freeway was not built either due to opposition from residents and financial limitations.

==Route description==
Route 90 begins at the Pennsylvania-New Jersey border on the Betsy Ross Bridge over the Delaware River, where the road continues into Philadelphia as an unnumbered freeway that heads to an interchange with I-95. Signs for the interchange along I-95 refer to New Jersey Route 90. From the Betsy Ross Bridge, Route 90 heads to the southeast into Pennsauken Township, Camden County as a six-lane freeway maintained by the Delaware River Port Authority, passing over residential areas as well as NJ Transit&#x27;s River Line and CR 543 (River Road). The road reaches a toll plaza in the westbound direction. Route 90 passes over CR 615 (Union Avenue) before coming to an interchange with US 130, where maintenance is transferred to the New Jersey Department of Transportation. Shortly past the US 130 interchange, the freeway narrows to four lanes before coming to a partial interchange with CR 644 (Haddonfield Road), where there is a westbound on-ramp and an eastbound off-ramp. The route crosses into Cinnaminson Township, Burlington County and passes over the Pennsauken Creek. A short distance later, the Route 90 freeway merges into Route 73.

==History==
Plans for the Route 90 freeway were first made in 1964, a year after the Betsy Ross Bridge over the Delaware River was proposed. In 1965, Route 90 was legislated to run from the proposed bridge in Pennsauken east to Route 73. In 1969, construction began on the Betsy Ross Bridge and its approach roads. A 1970 proposal to include the planned Route 90 freeway as a part of the Interstate Highway System was denied. The Betsy Ross Bridge itself was finished in 1974, but did not open to traffic until April 30, 1976 due to controversies concerning the approach roads. At this time, Route 90 was completed between the Betsy Ross Bridge and US 130. In March 1986, construction began on Route 90 between US 130 and Route 73 in Cinnaminson. This section of the route, which cost $23 million ($ million today), was opened on October 25, 1988.
Originally, Route 90 was intended to be a much longer freeway than it is today. When first proposed, it was to extend to I-295, the New Jersey Turnpike and Route 73 in Mount Laurel. There were two proposed routes of this freeway. The first proposal would have run south of Route 73 through built-up areas of Cherry Hill, Maple Shade, and Mount Laurel, along the South Branch of the Pennsauken Creek. Due to the route of this proposal, it was dropped in favor of a more northerly route that ran to the north of Route 73 through less developed areas. This freeway would have cost $42 million ($ million today) and was to be completed in 1975. There were plans to extend the freeway further south than Route 73 in Mount Laurel. In 1966, a proposal was made for Route 90 to run south to a proposed Route 38 freeway that was to run from Camden to Monmouth County. Another proposal in 1969 called for a $14 million ($ million today) extension of Route 90 south to a proposed US 30 freeway in Berlin and possibly the Atlantic City Expressway. Due to financial limitations and feared environmental impacts, the southern extension of Route 90 to Mount Laurel was canceled by 1980.

Across the Delaware River in Pennsylvania, there were plans of extending the freeway northwest from the I-95 interchange. This limited access highway, which was to be called the Pulaski Expressway and be designated PA 90, was to parallel the Frankford Creek and Tacony Creek and connect with Roosevelt Boulevard (US 1), which also was to be a limited access freeway. This proposed freeway, which was to cost from $125 to $150 million ($ to $ million today) and be completed in 1981, was canceled by 1980 due to community opposition and financial troubles. Vestiges of this extension can be seen from I-95 in the form of stub ramps and the mainline coming to an abrupt end as a barricaded bridge.

<doc id="234576" wikidata="Q469632" url="?curid=234576" title="American eel">
<text>The American eel (Anguilla rostrata) is a facultative catadromous eel found on the eastern coast of North America. Freshwater eels are fish belonging to the elopomorph superorder, a group of phylogenetically ancient teleosts. The American eel has a slender, supple, snake-like body that is covered with a mucus layer, which makes the eel appear to be naked and slimy despite the presence of minute scales. A long dorsal fin runs from the middle of the back and is continuous with a similar ventral fin. Pelvic fins are absent, and relatively small pectoral fins can be found near the midline, followed by the head and gill covers. Variations exist in coloration, from olive green, brown shading to greenish-yellow and light gray or white on the belly. Eels from clear water are often lighter than those from dark, tannic acid streams.

The eel lives in fresh water and estuaries and only leaves these habitats to enter the Atlantic Ocean to make its spawning migration to the Sargasso Sea. Spawning takes place far offshore, where the eggs hatch. The female can lay up to 4 million buoyant eggs and dies after egg-laying. After the eggs hatch and the early-stage larvae develop into leptocephali, the young eels move toward North America, where they metamorphose into glass eels and enter freshwater systems where they grow as yellow eels until they begin to mature.

The American eel is found along the Atlantic coast including the tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay, the Delaware River, and the Hudson River, and as far north as the Saint Lawrence River. It is also present in the river systems of the eastern Gulf of Mexico and in some areas further south. Like all anguillid eels, American eels hunt predominantly at night, and during the day they hide in mud, sand, or gravel very close to shore, at depths of roughly . They feed on crustaceans, aquatic insects, small insects, and probably any aquatic organisms that they can find and eat.

American eels are economically important in various areas along the East Coast as bait for fishing for sport fishes such as the striped bass, or as a food fish in some areas. Their recruitment stages, the glass eels, are also caught and sold for use in aquaculture, although this is now restricted in most areas.

Eels were once an abundant species in rivers, and were an important fishery for aboriginal people. The construction of hydroelectric dams has blocked their migrations and locally extirpated eels in many watersheds. For example, in Canada, the vast numbers of eels in the St. Lawrence and Ottawa Rivers have dwindled.

==Etymology==
The American eel &quot;Anguilla rostrata&quot; was first described in 1817 by Lesueur. is Latin for eel, and is a Latin word that can mean either &quot;beaked or curved&quot; or &quot;long nose&quot;. , .

==Description==

American eels can grow to in length and to in weight. Females are generally larger than males, lighter in color, with smaller eyes and higher fins. The body is elongate and snake-like. Its dorsal and anal fins are confluent with the rudimentary caudal fin. It lacks ventral fins but pectoral fins are present. The lateral line is well-developed and complete. The head is long and conical, with rather small, well-developed eyes. The mouth is terminal with jaws that are not particularly elongated. The teeth are small, pectinate or setiform in several series on the jaws and the vomer. Minute teeth also present on the pharyngeal bones, forming a patch on the upper pharyngeals. Tongue present with thick lips that are attached by a frenum in front. Nostrils are superior and well separated. Gill openings are partly below pectoral fins, relatively well-developed and well separated from one another. Inner gill slits are wide.

The scales are small, rudimentary, cycloid, relatively well embedded below the epidermis and therefore often difficult to see without magnification. The scales are not arranged in overlapping rows as they often are in other fish species but are rather irregular, in some places distributed like &quot;parquet flooring&quot;. In general, one row of scales lies at right angle to the next, although the rows immediately above and below the lateral line lie at an angle of approximately 45°. Unlike other bony fishes, the first scales do not develop immediately after the larval stage but appear much later on.

Several morphological features distinguish the American eel from other eel species. Tesch (1977) described three morphological characteristics which persist through all stages from larvae to maturing eels: the total number of vertebrae (mean 107.2), the number of myomeres (mean 108.2), and the distance between the origin of the dorsal fin to the anus (mean 9.1% of total length).

==Distribution and natural habitat==

===Geographic range===
The distribution of the American eel encompasses all accessible freshwater (streams and lakes), estuaries and coastal marine waters across a latitudinal range of 5 to 62 N. Their natural range includes the western North Atlantic Ocean coastline from Venezuela to Greenland and including Iceland. Inland, this species extends into the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River and its tributaries as far upstream as Minnesota and Wisconsin.

Nonindigenous occurrences of this species in the United States were recorded from Lake Mead on the Colorado River and on the Arizona border. It was stocked on a few occasions in Sacramento and San Francisco Bay, California, in the late 1800s. No apparent evidence of survival on these occasions was noted. It was also stocked and unintentionally introduced in various states, including Illinois, Indiana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Stockings of this species also occurred in Utah in the late 1800s, but soon disappeared.

===Natural habitat===

Eels are bottom dwellers. They hide in burrows, tubes, snags, masses of plants, other types of shelters. They are found in a variety of habitats including streams, rivers, and muddy or silt-bottomed lakes during their freshwater stage, as well as oceanic waters, coastal bays and estuaries. Individuals during the continental stage occasionally migrate between fresh, salt and brackish water habitats and have varying degrees of residence time in each. During winter, eels burrow under the mud and enter a state of torpor (or complete inactivity) at temperatures below . although they may occasionally be active during this period. Temperature requirements are suggested to be flexible. It has been found that American eels during elver stage can survive temperature as low as . Barila and Stauffer (1980) reported a final mean temperature preference at . Karlsson et al. (1984) disagreed with this interpretation and found the final temperature preference of 17.4 ± 2.0 °C with a 95% confidence interval.

Seasonal patterns described by Fletcher and Anderson (1972) generalize annual movements from freshwater to estuaries and coastal bays to feed during spring, then either a return during the fall to overwinter (juvenile and immature adults), or a southward migration to the spawning grounds (silver eels Continental phase eels appear highly plastic in habitat use. Eels are extremely mobile and may access habitats that appear unavailable to them, using small watercourses or moving through wet grasses. Small eels (&lt;100 mm total length) are able to climb and may succeed in passing over vertical barriers. Habitat availability may be reduced by factors such as habitat deterioration, barriers to upstream migration (larger eels), and barriers (i.e. turbines) to downstream migration that can result in mortality.

==Life cycle==

The American eel&#x27;s complex life history begins far offshore in the Sargasso Sea in a semelparous and panmictic reproduction. In 1926 Marie Poland Fish described the collection of eggs that she observed hatch into eels, which she expanded in her taxonomic description of the larval egg development. From there, young eels drift with ocean currents and then migrate inland into streams, rivers and lakes. This journey may take many years to complete with some eels traveling as far as 6,000 kilometers. After reaching these freshwater bodies, they feed and mature for approximately 10 to 25 years before migrating back to the Sargasso Sea in order to complete their life cycle.

Life stages are detailed below.

1. Eggs:
The eggs hatch within a week of deposition in the Sargasso Sea. McCleave et al. (1987) suggested that hatching peaks in February and may continue until April. Wang and Tzeng (2000) proposed, on the basis of otolith back-calculations, that hatching occurs from March to October and peaks in August. However, Cieri and McCleave (2000) argued that these back-calculated spawning dates do not match collection evidence and may be explained by resorption. Fecundity for many eels is between about 0.5 to 4.0 million eggs, with larger individuals releasing as many as 8.5 million eggs. The diameter of egg is about 1.1 mm. Fertilization is external, and adult eels are presumed to die after spawning. None has been reported to migrate up rivers.

2. Leptocephali:
The leptocephalus is the larval form, a stage strikingly different from the adult form the eels will grow into. Leptocephali are transparent with a small pointed head and large teeth and are frequently described as &quot;leaf-like&quot;. The laterally compressed larvae are passively transported west and north to the coastal waters on the eastern coast of North America, by the surface currents of the Gulf Stream system, a journey that will last between 7 and 12 months. Vertical distribution is usually restricted to the upper 350 m of the ocean. Growth has been evaluated at about 0.21 to 0.38 mm per day.

3. Glass eel:
As they enter the continental shelf, leptocephali metamorphose into glass eels (juveniles), which are transparent and possess the typical elongate and serpentine eel shape. The term glass eel refers to all developmental stages between the end of metamorphosis and full pigmentation. Metamorphosis occurs when leptocephali are about 55 to 65 mm long. Mean age at this metamorphosis has been evaluated at 200 days and estuarine arrival at 255 days; giving 55 days between glass eel metamorphosis and estuarine arrival. Young eels use selective tidal stream transport to move up estuaries. As they enter coastal waters, the animals essentially transform from a pelagic oceanic organism to a benthic continental organism.

4. Elvers:
Glass eels become progressively pigmented as they approach the shore; these eels are termed elvers. The melanic pigmentation process occurs when the young eels are in coastal waters. At this phase of the life cycle, the eel is still sexually undifferentiated. The elver stage lasts about three to twelve months. Elvers that enter fresh water may spend much of this period migrating upstream. Elver influx is linked to increased temperature and reduced flow early in the migration season, and to tidal cycle influence later on.

5. Yellow eels:
This is the sexually immature adult stage of American eel. They begin to develop a yellow color and a creamy or yellowish belly. In this phase, the eels are still mainly nocturnal. Those remaining in estuarine environment continue to go through their life cycle more quickly than those that traveled into freshwater. Those in freshwater, however, tend to live longer and attain much larger sizes. 

Sexual differentiation occurs during the yellow stage and appears to be strongly influenced by environmental conditions. Krueger and Oliveira (1999) suggested that density was the primary environmental factor influencing the sex ratio of eels in a river, with high densities promoting the production of males. From life history traits of four rivers of Maine, Oliveira and McCleave (2000) evaluated that sexual differentiation was completed by 270 mm total length.

6. Silver eels:
As the maturation process proceeds, the yellow eel metamorphoses into a silver eel. The silvering metamorphosis results in morphological and physiological modifications that prepare the animal to migrate back to the Sargasso Sea. The eel acquires a greyish colour with a whitish or cream coloration ventrally. The digestive tract degenerates, the pectoral fins enlarge to improve swimming capacity, eye diameter expands and visual pigments in the retina adapt to the oceanic environment, the integument thickens, percentage of somatic lipids increases to supply energy for migrating and spawning, gonadosomatic index and oocyte diameter increase, gonadotropin hormone (GTH-II) production increases, and osmoregulatory physiology changes.

==Feeding==
Eels are nocturnal and most of their feeding therefore occurs at night. Having a keen sense of smell, eels most likely depend on scent to find food. The American eel is a generalist species which colonizes a wide range of habitats. Their diet is therefore extremely diverse and includes most of the aquatic animals sharing the same environment. The American eel feeds on a variety of things such as worms, small fish, clams and other mollusks, crustaceans such as soft-shelled crabs and a lot of macroinvertebrate insects. A study on gastric examination of eels revealed that &quot;macroinvertebrates, predominantly of the Class Insecta, were eaten by 169 eels (99% of feeding eels)&quot; and &quot;the stonefly Acroneuria was the single most numerically dominant taxon observed in the diet, occurring in 67% of eel stomachs that contained food&quot;.

===Leptocephalus===
Little is known about the food habits of leptocephali. Recent studies on other eel species (Otake et al. 1993; Mochioka and Iwamizu 1996) suggest that leptocephali do not feed on zooplankton but rather consume detrital particles such as marine snow and fecal pellets or particles such as discarded houses of larvacean tunicates.

===Glass eel and elver===
Based on laboratory experiments on European glass eels, Lecomte-Finiger (1983) reported that they were morphologically and physiologically unable to feed. However, Tesch (1977) found that elvers at a later stage of pigmentation, stage VIA4, were feeding. Stomach examination of elvers caught during their upstream migration in the Petite Trinité River on the north shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence revealed that elvers fed primarily on insect larvae.

===Yellow eel===
The yellow eel is essentially a nocturnal benthic omnivore. Prey includes fishes, molluscs, bivalves, crustaceans, insect larvae, surface-dwelling insects, worms, frogs and plants. The eel prefers small prey animals which can easily be attacked. Food type varies with body size. Stomachs of eels less than 40 cm and captured in streams contained mainly aquatic insect larvae, whereas larger eels fed predominantly on fishes and crayfishes. Insect abundance decreased in larger eels. The eel diet adapts to seasonal changes and the immediate environment. Feeding activity decreases or stops during the winter, and food intake ceases as eels physiologically prepare for the spawning migration.

===Predation===
Little information about predation on eels has been published. It was reported that elvers and small yellow eels are prey of largemouth bass and striped bass, although they were not a major parts of these predators&#x27; diet. Leptocephali, glass eels, elvers, and small yellow eels are likely to be eaten by various predatory fishes. Older eels are also known to eat incoming glass eels. They also fall prey to other species of eels, bald eagles, gulls, as well as other fish-eating birds. American eels also make up the entirety of the diet of adult rainbow snakes, lending the species one of their common names; eel moccasin.

==Commercial fisheries==
The major outlet for US landings of yellow and silver eels is the EU market.

In the 1970s, the annual North Atlantic harvest averaged 125,418 kg, with an average value of $84,000. In 1977, the eel landings from Maine, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts were about 79,700, 2,700, and 143,300 kg, valued at $263,000, $5,000, and $170,000, respectively (US Department of Commerce 1984)

During the 1980s and early 1990s, the American eel was one of the top three species in commercial value to Ontario&#x27;s fishing industry. At its peak, the eel harvest was valued at $600,000 and, in some years, eel accounted for almost half of the value of the entire commercial fish harvest from Lake Ontario. The commercial catch of American eel has declined from approximately 223,000 kilograms (kg) in the early 1980s to 11,000 kg in 2002.

==Conservation==

According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the American eel is at very high risk of extinction in the wild.

Substantial decline in numbers and fishery landings of American eels over their range in eastern Canada and the US was noted, raising concerns over the status of this species. The number of juvenile eels in the Lake Ontario area decreased from 935,000 in 1985 to about 8,000 in 1993 and was approaching zero levels in 2001. Rapid declines were also recorded in Virginia, as well as in New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island in Canada.

Because of its complex life cycle, the species face a broad range of threats, some of which are specific to certain growth stage. Being catadromous, the eels&#x27; reproductivity success depends heavily on free downstream passage for spawning migration. It also depends on the availability of diverse habitats for growth and maturation.

Sex ratio in the population can also be affected because males and females tend to utilize different habitats. Impacts on certain regions may greatly impact the number of either sex.

Despite being able to live in a wide range of temperatures and different levels of salinity, American eels are very sensitive to low dissolved oxygen level, which is typically found below dams. Contaminations of heavy metals, dioxins, chlordane, and polychlorinated biphenyls as well as pollutants from nonpoint source can bioaccumulate within the fat tissues of the eels, causing dangerous toxicity and reduced productivity. This problem is exacerbated due to the high fat content of eels.

Construction of dams and other irrigation facilities seriously decreases habitat availability and diversity for the eels. Dredging can affect migration, population distribution and prey availability. Overfishing or excessive harvesting of juveniles can also negatively impact local populations.

Other natural threats come from interspecific competition with exotic species like the flathead catfish (&quot;Pylodictis olivaris&quot;) and blue catfish (&quot;Ictalurus furcatus)&quot;, pathogens and parasites, and changes in oceanographic conditions that can alter currents—this potentially changes larval transport and migration of juveniles back to freshwater streams.

===Conservation measures===
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service reviewed the status of the American eel both in 2007 and in 2015, finding both times that Endangered Species Act protection for the American eel is not warranted.

The Canadian province of Ontario has cancelled the commercial fishing quota since 2004. Eel sport fishery has been closed. Efforts have been made to improve the passage in which eels migrate across the hydroelectric dams on St. Lawrence River.

As of August 2023, &quot;A. rostrata&quot; is under consideration for protection under the Canadian Species at Risk Act. The Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada reported that the species was threatened in 2012.

===Sustainable consumption===
In 2010, Greenpeace International has added the American eel to its seafood red list. &quot;The Greenpeace International seafood red list is a list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries.&quot;

<text>String field theory (SFT) is a formalism in string theory in which the dynamics of relativistic strings is reformulated in the language of quantum field theory. This is accomplished at the level of perturbation theory by finding a collection of vertices for joining and splitting strings, as well as string propagators, that give a Feynman diagram-like expansion for string scattering amplitudes. In most string field theories, this expansion is encoded by a classical action found by second-quantizing the free string and adding interaction terms. As is usually the case in second quantization, a classical field configuration of the second-quantized theory is given by a wave function in the original theory. In the case of string field theory, this implies that a classical configuration, usually called the string field, is given by an element of the free string Fock space.

The principal advantages of the formalism are that it allows the computation of off-shell amplitudes and, when a classical action is available, gives non-perturbative information that cannot be seen directly from the standard genus expansion of string scattering. In particular, following the work of Ashoke Sen, it has been useful in the study of tachyon condensation on unstable D-branes. It has also had applications to topological string theory, non-commutative geometry, and strings in low dimensions.

String field theories come in a number of varieties depending on which type of string is second quantized: &quot;Open string field theories&quot; describe the scattering of open strings, &quot;closed string field theories&quot; describe closed strings, while &quot;open-closed string field theories&quot; include both open and closed strings.

In addition, depending on the method used to fix the worldsheet diffeomorphisms and conformal transformations in the original free string theory, the resulting string field theories can be very different. Using light cone gauge, yields &quot;light-cone string field theories&quot; whereas using BRST quantization, one finds &quot;covariant string field theories&quot;. There are also hybrid string field theories, known as &quot;covariantized light-cone string field theories&quot; which use elements of both light-cone and BRST gauge-fixed string field theories.

A final form of string field theory, known as &quot;background independent open string field theory&quot;, takes a very different form; instead of second quantizing the worldsheet string theory, it second quantizes the space of two-dimensional quantum field theories.

== Light-cone string field theory ==
Light-cone string field theories were introduced by Stanley Mandelstam and developed by Mandelstam, Michael Green, John Schwarz and Lars Brink. An explicit description of the second-quantization of the light-cone string was given by Michio Kaku and Keiji Kikkawa.

Light-cone string field theories were the first string field theories to be constructed and are based on the simplicity of string scattering in light-cone gauge. For example, in the bosonic closed string case, the worldsheet scattering diagrams naturally take a Feynman diagram-like form, being built from two ingredients, a propagator,

and two vertices for splitting and joining strings, which can be used to glue three propagators together,

These vertices and propagators produce a single cover of the moduli space of formula_1-point closed string scattering amplitudes so no higher order vertices are required. Similar vertices exist for the open string.

When one considers light-cone quantized &quot;superstrings&quot;, the discussion is more subtle as divergences can arise when the light-cone vertices collide. To produce a consistent theory, it is necessary to introduce higher order vertices, called contact terms, to cancel the divergences.

Light-cone string field theories have the disadvantage that they break manifest Lorentz invariance. However, in backgrounds with light-like Killing vectors, they can considerably simplify the quantization of the string action. Moreover, until the advent of the Berkovits string it was the only known method for quantizing strings in the presence of Ramond–Ramond fields. In recent research, light-cone string field theory played an important role in understanding strings in pp-wave backgrounds.

== Free covariant string field theory ==
An important step in the construction of covariant string field theories (preserving manifest Lorentz invariance) was the construction of a covariant kinetic term. This kinetic term can be considered a string field theory in its own right: the string field theory of free strings. Since the work of Warren Siegel, it has been standard to &quot;first&quot; BRST-quantize the free string theory and &quot;then&quot; second quantize so that the classical fields of the string field theory include ghosts as well as matter fields. For example, in the case of the bosonic open string theory in 26-dimensional flat spacetime, a general element of the Fock-space of the BRST quantized string takes the form (in radial quantization in the upper half plane),

::formula_2
where formula_3 is the free string vacuum and the dots represent more massive fields. In the language of worldsheet string theory, formula_4, formula_5, and formula_6 represent the amplitudes for the string to be found in the various basis states. After second quantization, they are interpreted instead as classical fields representing the tachyon formula_7, gauge field formula_8 and a ghost field formula_9.

In the worldsheet string theory, the unphysical elements of the Fock space are removed by imposing the condition formula_10 as well as the equivalence relation formula_11. After second quantization, the equivalence relation is interpreted as a gauge invariance, whereas the condition that formula_12 is physical is interpreted as an equation of motion. Because the physical fields live at ghostnumber one, it is also assumed that the string field formula_12 is a ghostnumber one element of the Fock space.

In the case of the open bosonic string a gauge-unfixed action with the appropriate symmetries and equations of motion was originally obtained by André Neveu, Hermann Nicolai and Peter C. West. It is given by
:: formula_14
where formula_15 is the BPZ-dual of formula_12.

For the bosonic closed string, construction of a BRST-invariant kinetic term requires additionally that one impose formula_17 and formula_18. The kinetic term is then
:: formula_19

Additional considerations are required for the superstrings to deal with the superghost zero-modes.

== Witten&#x27;s cubic open string field theory ==
The best studied and simplest of covariant interacting string field theories was constructed by Edward Witten. It describes the dynamics of bosonic open strings and is given by adding to the free open string action a cubic vertex:
:: formula_20,

where, as in the free case, formula_21 is a ghostnumber one element of the BRST-quantized free bosonic open-string Fock-space.

The cubic vertex,
::formula_22
is a trilinear map which takes three string fields of total ghostnumber three and yields a number. 
Following Witten, who was motivated by ideas from noncommutative geometry, it is conventional to introduce the formula_23-product defined implicitly through
:: formula_24

The formula_23-product and cubic vertex satisfy a number of important properties (allowing the formula_26 to be general ghost number fields):

In these equations, formula_27 denotes the ghost number of formula_21.

===Gauge invariance ===
These properties of the cubic vertex are sufficient to show that formula_29 is invariant under
the Yang–Mills-like gauge transformation,
:: formula_30
where formula_31 is an infinitesimal gauge parameter. Finite gauge transformations take the form
:: formula_32
where the exponential is defined by,
:: formula_33

===Equations of motion ===
The equations of motion are given by the following equation: 
:: formula_34
Because the string field formula_21 is an infinite collection of ordinary classical fields, these equations represent an infinite collection of non-linear coupled differential equations. There have been two approaches to finding solutions: First, numerically, one can truncate the string field to include only fields with mass less than a fixed bound, a procedure known as &quot;level truncation&quot;. This reduces the equations of motion to a finite number of coupled differential equations and has led to the discovery of many solutions. Second, following the work of Martin Schnabl one can seek analytic solutions by carefully picking an ansatz which has simple behavior under star multiplication and action by the BRST operator. This has led to solutions representing marginal deformations, the tachyon vacuum solution and time-independent D-brane systems.

===Quantization===
To consistently quantize formula_29 one has to fix a gauge. The traditional choice has been Feynman–Siegel gauge,
:: formula_37
Because the gauge transformations are themselves redundant (there are gauge transformations of the gauge transformations), the gauge fixing procedure requires introducing an infinite number of ghosts via the BV formalism. The complete gauge fixed action is given by
:: formula_38
where the field formula_21 is now allowed to be of &quot;arbitrary ghostnumber&quot;. In this gauge, the Feynman diagrams are constructed from a single propagator and vertex. The propagator takes the form of a strip of worldsheet of width formula_40 and length formula_7

There is also an insertion of an integral of the formula_42-ghost along the red line. The modulus, formula_7 is integrated from 0 to formula_44.

The three vertex can be described as a way of gluing three propagators together, as shown in the following picture:

In order to represent the vertex embedded in three dimensions, the propagators have been folded in half along their midpoints. The resulting geometry is completely flat except for a single curvature singularity where the midpoints of the three propagators meet.

These Feynman diagrams generate a complete cover of the moduli space of open string scattering diagrams. It follows that, for on-shell amplitudes, the &quot;n&quot;-point open string amplitudes computed using Witten&#x27;s open string field theory are identical to those computed using standard worldsheet methods.

== Supersymmetric covariant open string field theories ==
There are two main constructions of supersymmetric extensions of Witten&#x27;s cubic open string field theory. The first is very similar in form to its bosonic cousin and is known as &quot;modified cubic superstring field theory&quot;. The second, due to Nathan Berkovits is very different and is based on a WZW-type action.

===Modified cubic superstring field theory===
The first consistent extension of Witten&#x27;s bosonic open string field theory to the RNS string was constructed by Christian Preitschopf, Charles Thorn and Scott Yost and independently by Irina Aref&#x27;eva, P. B. Medvedev and A. P. Zubarev. The NS string field is taken to be a ghostnumber one picture zero string field in the small Hilbert space (i.e. formula_45). The action takes a very similar form to bosonic action,
:: formula_46
where, 
:: formula_47
is the inverse picture changing operator. The suggested formula_48 picture number extension of this theory to the Ramond sector might be problematic.

This action has been shown to reproduce tree-level amplitudes and has a tachyon vacuum solution with the correct energy. The one subtlety in the action is the insertion of picture changing operators at the midpoint, which imply that the linearized equations of motion take the form
:: formula_49
Because formula_50 has a non-trivial kernel, there are potentially extra solutions that are not in the cohomology of formula_51. However, such solutions would have operator insertions near the midpoint and would be potentially singular, and importance of this problem remains unclear.

===Berkovits superstring field theory===
A very different supersymmetric action for the open string was constructed by Nathan Berkovits. It takes the form
:: formula_52
where all of the products are performed using the formula_23-product including the anticommutator formula_54, and formula_55 is any string field such that formula_56 and formula_57. The string field formula_58 is taken to be in the NS sector of the large Hilbert space, i.e. &quot;including&quot; the zero mode of formula_59. It is not known how to incorporate the R sector, although some preliminary ideas exist.

The equations of motion take the form
::formula_60

The action is invariant under the gauge transformation
:: formula_61

The principal advantage of this action is that it free from any insertions of picture-changing operators. It has been shown to reproduce correctly tree level amplitudes and has been found, numerically, to have a tachyon vacuum with appropriate energy. The known analytic solutions to the classical equations of motion include the tachyon vacuum and marginal deformations.

===Other formulations of covariant open superstring field theory===
A formulation of superstring field theory using the non-minimal pure-spinor variables was introduced by Berkovits. The action is cubic and includes a midpoint insertion whose kernel is trivial. As always within the pure-spinor formulation, the Ramond sector can be easily treated. However, it is not known how to incorporate the GSO- sectors into the formalism.

In an attempt to resolve the allegedly problematic midpoint insertion of the modified cubic theory, Berkovits and Siegel proposed a superstring field theory based on a non-minimal extension of the RNS string, which uses a midpoint insertion with no kernel. It is not clear if such insertions are in any way better than midpoint insertions with non-trivial kernels.

==Covariant closed string field theory ==
Covariant closed string field theories are considerably more complicated than their open string cousins. Even if one wants to construct a string field theory which only reproduces &quot;tree-level&quot; interactions between closed strings, the classical action must contain an &quot;infinite&quot; number of vertices consisting of string polyhedra.

If one demands that on-shell scattering diagrams be reproduced to all orders in the string coupling, one must also include additional vertices arising from higher genus (and hence higher order in formula_62) as well. In general, a manifestly BV invariant, quantizable action takes the form 
:: formula_63
where formula_64 denotes an formula_1th order vertex arising from a genus formula_66 surface and formula_67 is the closed string coupling. The structure of the vertices is in principle determined by a minimal area prescription, although, even for the polyhedral vertices, explicit computations have only been performed to quintic order.

==Covariant heterotic string field theory ==

A formulation of the NS sector of the heterotic string was given by Berkovits, Okawa and Zwiebach.
The formulation amalgamates bosonic closed string field theory with Berkovits&#x27; superstring field theory.

<doc id="234578" wikidata="Q825233" url="?curid=234578" title="New Jersey Route 91">
<text>Route 91 is a spur state highway in Middlesex County, New Jersey. The route runs as a spur of U.S. Route 1 (US 1) along Jersey Avenue in North Brunswick Township to Van Dyke Avenue in the city of New Brunswick. At Van Dyke Avenue, Route 91 ends as a state route, and Jersey Avenue continues as County Route 693 (CR 693) to Route 27 in the center of New Brunswick. The mainline of Route 91 officially ends at the ramps to and from US 1 southbound (bound for Trenton) and Orchard Street; the connector constructed from US 1 northbound is designated as Route 91 Connector.

The route originates as the Route 26 Connecting Link, an extension of Jersey Avenue. This alignment was designated as Route 26A, a spur of State Highway Route 26 in 1941, and renumbered in the 1953 state highway renumbering as Route 91. The route has remained virtually untouched since.

==Route description==

Route 91 begins at an interchange with US 1 in the North Brunswick Township, New Jersey community of Adams. The route heads northward as Jersey Avenue, passing several fields and ponds, running parallel to US 1. A short distance later, Route 91 enters the industrial district of North Brunswick, where it reaches an intersection with Route 91 Connector, a spur from US 1 northbound to the Route 91 mainline. Paralleling Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor tracks to the west, Jersey Avenue passes through a small corporate park in North Brunswick. A short distance later, Route 91 intersects with CR 680 (How Lane), which connects Route 91 with nearby Route 27 and Route 26. Upon crossing How Lane, Route 91 crosses the township line and enters the city of New Brunswick.

Route 91 continues northward along Jersey Avenue, passing through the industrial districts in the southeastern portion of the city. With the Northeast Corridor tracks nearby, Route 91 intersects with Triangle Road, where it meets a park &amp; ride and the service road to the Jersey Avenue station serving NJ Transit&#x27;s Northeast Corridor Line. There, the highway also crosses a railroad spur from the train line. The highway continues, passing some commercial buildings, before the Route 91 designation terminates at an intersection with Van Dyke Avenue. Jersey Avenue continues into New Brunswick&#x27;s center as Middlesex County Route 693.

==History==
Route 91 was originally constructed in 1929 as the Route 26 Connecting Link, extending Jersey Avenue south from Van Dyke Avenue to the old Trenton and New Brunswick Turnpike in North Brunswick, where it followed this highway for a short distance to the end of a new bridge carrying Route 26 over the Pennsylvania Railroad. This route allowed a bypass of New Brunswick&#x27;s downtown to reach the Albany Street Bridge. In 1941, this highway was designated by the legislature as State Highway Route 26A. The existing Jersey Avenue beyond Van Dyke Avenue was taken over by Middlesex County as County Route 3R20, later renumbered County Route 693.

During the second state highway renumbering in January 1953, the designation of Route 26 was truncated from Trenton to U.S. Route 1 in North Brunswick Township. With Route 26A no longer terminating at its parent highway, the suffixed spur was renumbered to Route 91, heading from U.S. Route 1 in Adams to Van Dyke Road. The route has changed little since designation.

<doc id="234579" wikidata="Q276879" url="?curid=234579" title="Korean Americans">
<text>Korean Americans () are Americans of full or partial Korean ethnic descent. While the broader term Overseas Korean in America () may refer to all ethnic Koreans residing in the United States, the specific designation of Korean American implies the holding of American citizenship. 

As of 2022, there are 1.5–1.8 million Americans of Korean descent, of whom roughly 1.04 million were born abroad, accounting for 8% of all Asian Americans and 0.5% of the total U.S. population. However, prominent scholars and Korean associations claim that the Korean American population exceeds 2.5–3 million, which would make it the largest community Overseas Koreans in the world, ahead of China&#x27;s 2.1 million.

The vast majority of Korean Americans trace their ancestry to South Korea (Republic of Korea), with North Korea (Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea) accounting for a negligible number. An estimated 20,000 second generation Korean Americans are &quot;dual citizens by birth&quot; (선천적 복수국적자).

In contrast to Northeast Asia, which is grappling with a significantly low birth rates, the number of Korean Americans with both parents from Korea is growing by 5.9%. Moreover, the population of those with mixed heritage is increasing at a rate of 16.5%. 

== Background ==
As of 2023, Korean Americans made up about 0.6% of the U.S. population, numbering approximately 2 million people. They are the fifth-largest subgroup within the Asian American community, following Chinese Americans, Filipino Americans, Indian Americans, and Vietnamese Americans.

The United States is the residence of the world&#x27;s most extensive Korean diasporas, largely from South Korea. As of 2006, due to historical diplomatic challenges stemming from the Korean War in the 1950s, the number of North Korean defectors to the United States has remained below 220, constituting a negligible 0.008352 percent of the total Korean American demographic. Thus, it is evident that an overwhelming majority, approximately 99.991648 percent, of the Korean American population traces its roots to South Korea. The Republic of Korea is acknowledged as a principal ally of the United States, fostering a relationship built on mutual values, intertwined economic interests, and strategic security cooperation.

According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of South Korea, as of 2021, the population of Overseas Koreans residing in the United States was 2,633,777. This figure includes both U.S. citizens of Korean descent and South Korean nationals living in the U.S. Specifically, there were 1,529,855 U.S. citizens of Korean descent and 1,103,922 South Korean nationals. By 2021, the U.S. Census Bureau reported the number of Korean Americans as 1,469,854, considering only those who identified with a single race. Notably, about 1,011,589 of these individuals were born in Korea. The population has remained relatively stable into 2023, with the Overseas Koreans Foundation reporting a figure of 2,615,419.

==Demographics==

As of 2023, the United States, which is home to the largest population of overseas Koreans, has the following distribution of Korean Americans.

* In California, there are 558,338 Korean Americans.
* New York City has a Korean American population of 141,745.
* Texas is home to 115,107 Korean Americans.
* New Jersey&#x27;s Korean American community numbers 113,736.
* Virginia is home to 94,275 Korean Americans.
* Washington has a Korean American population of 92,798.
* Illinois includes 81,340 Korean Americans.
* Georgia&#x27;s Korean American community comprises 75,525 individuals.
* Maryland has 48,468 Korean Americans.
* Other states collectively account for 509,870 Korean Americans.

In 2023, the proportion of Korean Americans in the population varies significantly across the United States. The highest proportion is in Hawaii, accounting for 3.87% of the state&#x27;s total population. California follows with 1.43%, hosting a large Korean American community; this is notably high considering the overall Korean ethnicity ratio of 0.59% in the U.S. Washington State (1.28%), New Jersey (1.19%), and Virginia (1.09%) also have relatively large Korean American communities. Maryland&#x27;s proportion is 0.97%, and Alaska&#x27;s is 0.95%. Nevada has 0.72%, New York City 0.71%, and Georgia 0.69%.
The two metropolitan areas with the highest Korean American populations as per the 2010 census were the Greater Los Angeles area Combined Statistical Area (334,329) and the Greater New York Combined Statistical Area (218,764). The Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area ranks third, with approximately 93,000 Korean Americans clustered in Howard and Montgomery Counties in Maryland and Fairfax County in Virginia. Southern California and the New York City metropolitan area have the largest populations of Koreans outside of the Korean Peninsula. Among Korean Americans &quot;born in Korea&quot;, the Los Angeles metropolitan area had 226,000 as of 2012; New York (including Northern New Jersey) had 153,000 Korean-born Korean Americans; and Washington had 60,000.

By percentage, the Korean American population of Bergen County, New Jersey, in the New York City Metropolitan Area, at 6.5% of Bergen County&#x27;s population in 2022, was the highest of any county in the United States. Bergen County, host to the county&#x27;s highly ranked Academies magnet public high school as well as to the North American headquarters operations of South Korean chaebols including Samsung, LG Corp, and Hanjin Shipping, was home to all of the nation&#x27;s top 10 municipalities by percentage of Korean population. These top 10 municipalities in the growing Korean hub of Bergen County, New Jersey, across the George Washington Bridge from New York City, were led by Palisades Park, the municipality with the highest density of ethnic Koreans in the Western Hemisphere. Displaying ubiquitous Hangul signage and known as the &quot;Korean Village&quot;, Palisades Park uniquely comprises a Korean majority, at 53.7% of the borough&#x27;s population in 2022. with both the highest Korean-American density and percentage of any municipality in the United States. The city of Los Angeles contained the highest Korean American population of any city proper in 2010, approximately 108,282. Between 1990 and 2000, Georgia was home to the fastest-growing Korean community in the U.S., growing at a rate of 88.2% over that decade. There is a significant Korean American population in the Atlanta metropolitan area, mainly in Gwinnett County (2.7% Korean) and Fulton County (1.0% Korean).

According to the statistics of the Overseas Korean Foundation and the Republic of Korea&#x27;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, 107,145 South Korean children were adopted into the United States between 1953 and 2007. In a 2005 United States Census Bureau survey, an estimated 432,907 ethnic Koreans in the U.S. were native-born Americans, and 973,780 were foreign-born. Korean Americans that were naturalized citizens numbered at 530,100, while 443,680 Koreans in the U.S. were not American citizens.

While people living in North Korea cannot—except under rare circumstances—leave their country, there are many people of North Korean origin living in the U.S., a substantial portion who fled to the south during the Korean War and later emigrated to the United States. Since the North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 allowed North Korean defectors to be admitted as refugees, about 130 have settled in the U.S. under that status after 2004. The counties with largest Korean population are Los Angeles County and Orange County in California, Bergen County in New Jersey, and Queens County in New York.

==History==
Korean Immigration to the US can be divided into four phases:

# Small-scale immigration around 1884
# Early immigration from 1903 to 1950
# Immigration following the Korean war (1950–1964)
# Immigration following the 1965 Immigration Act

=== Small-scale immigration around 1884 ===

Around 1884, following the establishment of diplomatic relations between the US and Korea (then referred to as Chosen) through the Treaty of Peace, Anmity, Commerce, and Navigation, a small number of diplomats entered the US as part of the 1883 Korean special mission to the United States. Included among the members of this mission were and Yu Kil-chun, the latter of whom stayed in the US for several years to study, making him the first Korean exchange student in the US.

=== Early immigration from 1903 to 1950 ===

One of the first Korean Americans was Philip Jaisohn, who came to America in 1884 and became a leader in the movement for Korean independence. Another prominent figure among the Korean immigrant community is Ahn Chang Ho, art name Dosan, a Protestant social activist. He came to the United States in 1902 for education. He founded the Friendship Society in 1903 and the Mutual Assistance Society. He was also a political activist during the Japanese occupation of Korea.
Another prominent figure among the Korean immigrant community was Syngman Rhee, a Methodist. He came to the United States in 1904 and earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree at George Washington University in 1907, a master&#x27;s degree at Harvard University, and a PhD from Princeton University in 1910. In 1910, he returned to Korea and became a political activist. He later became the first president of the Republic of Korea.

In 1903, the first group of Korean laborers came to Hawaii on January 13, now known annually as &quot;Korean American Day.&quot; The migration of Koreans to Hawaii can be explained by conditions in both the US and Korea. Koreans suffered from a series of natural disasters and heavy taxation. In Hawaii, plantation owners who had relied upon Chinese and Japanese labor faced a labor shortage after the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. Koreans were brought in as an alternative labor source. King Kojong promoted Korean immigration by establishing a Korean Department of Emigration and granting American businessmen permission to recruit Koreans for immigration to Korea.

Between 1904 and 1907, about 1,000 Koreans entered the mainland from Hawaii through San Francisco. Many Koreans dispersed along the Pacific Coast as farm workers or as wage laborers in mining companies and as section hands on the railroads. Picture brides became a common practice for marriage to Korean men. Other than those seeking better economic opportunities in the US, there were also Koreans who left for the US as refugees of the Japanese empire. Between 1910 and 1918, 541 students escaped Japan and arrived in the US through a third country. Individuals such as Whang Sa Sun, who were deeply involved in the Korean independence movement also came to the US to escape Japanese persecution. Between 1905 and 1910, political activities in Korean American communities surged in opposition towards Japanese aggression towards Korea.

Korean Americans formed organizations throughout the US, with a concentration in Hawaii and California. In 1903, the same year that the first Korean laborers arrived in Hawai, Koreans formed the Sinminhoe (New People&#x27;s Association). In 1909, two of the largest Korean American organizations would merge to form the Korean National Association, the largest Korean immigrant organization in North America. Established in San Francisco, The Korean National Association, would eventually expand to 130 chapters. The organization coordinated the activities of Korean Americans across North America, holding mass protests and positioning itself as the official representative of Korean Americans. Leaders included An Changho, Syngman Rhee, and Park Yong-man. This organization, along with many others, would play a key role in the Korean independence movement between 1910 and 1945.

After the annexation of Korea by Japan in 1910, Korean migration to the United States came to a virtual halt. The Japanese colonial government had initially allowed Koreans to immigrate to the US starting in 1902, but later banned Korean emigration to secure manpower on the Korean peninsula and to protect Japanese Americans from Korean competition in the US. The Japanese government did, however, allow Korean women to immigrate to the US (many of whom arrived as picture brides) to pacify nationalist sentiment in Korean American communities. The Immigration Act of 1924 (also referred to as the &quot;Oriental Exclusion Act)&quot; also worked to systematically exclude Korean immigrants from coming to the US.

=== Immigration following the Korean War (1950–1964) ===

Due to the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, opportunities were more open to Asian Americans, enabling Korean Americans to move out of enclaves into middle-class neighborhoods. When the Korean War ended in 1953, small numbers of students and professionals entered the United States. A larger group of immigrants included women married with U.S. servicemen commonly referred to as &quot;war brides&quot;. These women faced discrimination in the US as well as in South Korea, where many were labelled as whores or traitors. Following in 1953, South Korea had allowed international adoption. This had stemmed from the result of the Korean war as it left many children displaced. As a result of allowing external adoption in South Korea, a majority of the children have been adopted from families across the United States. With the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, Koreans became one of the fastest growing Asian groups in the United States, surpassed only by Filipinos.

=== Immigration following the 1965 Immigration Act ===

The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 abolished the quota system that had restricted the numbers of Asians allowed to enter the United States. Over 560,000 Koreans have immigrated to the US from 1970 to 1990. Large numbers of Koreans, including some from North Korea who had come via South Korea, have immigrated ever since, placing Korea in the top six countries of origin of immigrants to the United States since 1975. The reasons for immigration vary and include the desire for freedom and to seek better economic opportunities. The 1965 Immigration Act also generated a shift in the demographics of the Korean American community, with &quot;new immigrants&quot; making up the majority of the Korean American population.

=== The Korean American Experience after the 1980s ===

In the 1980s and 1990s, Koreans became noted not only for starting small businesses such as dry cleaners or convenience stores, but also for diligently planting churches. They would venture into abandoned cities and start up businesses which happened to be predominantly African American in demographics. This would sometimes lead to publicized tensions with customers as dramatized in movies such as Spike Lee&#x27;s &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot;.
Their children, along with those of other Asian Americans, would also be noted in headlines and magazine covers in the 1980s for their numbers in prestigious universities and highly skilled white collar professions. Favorable socioeconomic status and education have led to the painting of Asian Americans, including Korean Americans, as a &quot;model minority&quot;. However, this label is a controversial one: many individuals claim that the &quot;model minority&quot; label derides other communities of color and dismisses the challenges that the Korean Americans, and other Asian American ethnic groups, face. For instance, 12.8% of all Korean Americans live at or below the poverty line.
A large number of Korean Americans do not have health insurance due to language access barriers. Furthermore, older Korean Americans, who are at significant risk of developing mental health conditions, are less likely to access mental health services even when exhibiting symptoms. This is due to stigma and cultural misconceptions regarding mental health conditions.

Los Angeles has emerged as a major center of the Korean American community. The city has undergone a rapid transition in the 1990s marked by an influx of Koreans and investment by Korean banks and corporations. Many entrepreneurs opened small businesses, and were hard hit by the 1992 Los Angeles riots More recently, L.A.&#x27;s Koreatown has been perceived to have experienced declining political power secondary to re-districting, and an increased crime rate, prompting an exodus of Koreans from the area. Furthermore, the aftermath of the 1992 riots witnessed a large number of Koreans from Southern California moving to the San Francisco Bay Area and opening businesses and buying property near downtown Oakland, furthering the growth of that city&#x27;s Koreatown until the early 2000s.

According to Park (1998), the violence against Korean Americans in 1992 stimulated a new wave of political activism among Korean Americans, but it also split them into two main camps. The &quot;liberals&quot; sought to unite with other minorities in Los Angeles to fight against racial oppression and scapegoating. The &quot;conservatives,&quot; emphasized law and order and generally favored the economic and social policies of the Republican Party. The conservatives tended to emphasize the political differences between Koreans and other minorities, specifically blacks and Hispanics. Abelmann and Lie, (1997) report that the most profound result was the politicization of Korean Americans, all across the U.S. The younger generation especially realized they had been too uninvolved in American politics, and the riot shifted their political attention from South Korea to conditions in the United States.

Also accelerated by the 1992 riots, Orange County&#x27;s Korean population grew from its starting point in Koreatown, Garden Grove. As of 2020, Orange County had the second largest number of Korean Americans of any county in America, neighboring Los Angeles County has the most, numbering over 229,593. Koreans originally moved into Garden Grove after Olympic gold medalist Sammy Lee bought a home in the 1950s signaling to other ethnic minorities that they could move into Orange County. Since then, Koreans have spread throughout northern Orange County, mainly concentrating in Buena Park, Fullerton, Cerritos, La Palma, Cypress, and Irvine. Garden Grove is now home to more than 1,500 Korean businesses, and has held a Korean festival, night market, and parade every year since 1983. Mostly older and more traditional Korean businesses and food are found in Garden Grove, while newer and trendier Seoul based chains often locate in Buena Park and Irvine. The Source OC is a multi-level Korean themed mall in Buena Park that houses over 100 restaurants, as well as Korean themed bars, a school, K-pop stores, and a PC gaming café.
A substantial number of affluent Korean American professionals have settled in Bergen County, New Jersey since the early 2000s (decade) and have founded various academically and communally supportive organizations, including the Korean Parent Partnership Organization at the Bergen County Academies magnet high school and The Korean-American Association of New Jersey. Holy Name Medical Center in Teaneck, New Jersey, within Bergen County, has undertaken an effort to provide comprehensive health care services to underinsured and uninsured Korean patients from a wide area with its &quot;Korean Medical Program&quot;, drawing over 1,500 Korean American patients to its annual health festival. Bergen County&#x27;s Broad Avenue Koreatown in Palisades Park has emerged as a dominant nexus of Korean American culture, and its Senior Citizens Center provides a popular gathering place where even Korean grandmothers were noted to follow the dance trend of the worldwide viral hit &quot;Gangnam Style&quot; by South Korean &quot;K-pop&quot; rapper Psy in September 2012; while the nearby Fort Lee Koreatown is also emerging as such. The Chusok Korean Thanksgiving harvest festival has become an annual tradition in Bergen County, attended by several tens of thousands.

Bergen County&#x27;s growing Korean community was cited by county executive Kathleen Donovan in the context of Hackensack, New Jersey attorney Jae Y. Kim&#x27;s appointment to Central Municipal Court judgeship in January 2011. Subsequently, in January 2012, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie nominated attorney Phillip Kwon of Bergen County for New Jersey Supreme Court justice, although this nomination was rejected by the state&#x27;s Senate Judiciary Committee, and in July 2012, Kwon was appointed instead as deputy general counsel of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. According to &quot;The Record&quot; of Bergen County, the U.S. Census Bureau has determined the county&#x27;s Korean American population—2010 census figures put it at 56,773 (increasing to 63,247 by the 2011 American Community Survey)—grew enough to warrant language assistance during elections, and Bergen County&#x27;s Koreans have earned significant political respect. As of May 2014, Korean Americans had garnered at least four borough council seats in Bergen County.

===Flatbush boycott===
In 1990, Korean American owned shops were boycotted in the Flatbush section of the borough of Brooklyn in New York City. The boycott started by Black Nationalist, Sonny Carson, lasted for six months and became known as the Flatbush boycott.

===Comfort women===
In May 2012, officials in Bergen County&#x27;s borough of Palisades Park, New Jersey rejected requests by two diplomatic delegations from Japan to remove a small monument from a public park, a brass plaque on a block of stone, dedicated in 2010 to the memory of comfort women, thousands of women, many Koreans, who were forced into sexual slavery by Japanese soldiers during World War II. Days later, a South Korean delegation endorsed the borough&#x27;s decision. However, in neighboring Fort Lee, various Korean American groups could not reach consensus on the design and wording for such a monument as of early April 2013. In October 2012, a similar memorial was announced in nearby Hackensack, to be raised behind the Bergen County Courthouse, alongside memorials to the Holocaust, the Great Irish Famine, the Armenian genocide, and Slavery in the United States and was unveiled in March 2013. An apology and monetary compensation of roughly $8,000,000 by Japan to South Korea in December 2015 for these crimes largely fell flat in Bergen County, where the first U.S. monument to pay respects to comfort women was erected.

===East Sea controversy===
According to &quot;The Record&quot;, the Korean American Association of New Jersey petitioned Bergen County school officials in 2013 to use textbooks that refer to the Sea of Japan as the &quot;East Sea&quot; as well. In February 2014, Bergen County lawmakers announced legislative efforts to include the name East Sea in future New Jersey school textbooks. In April 2014, a bill to recognize references to the Sea of Japan also as the East Sea in Virginia textbooks was signed into law.

===&quot;Sewol&quot; ferry tragedy memorial in the United States===
In May 2014, the Palisades Park Public Library in New Jersey created a memorial dedicated to the victims of the tragic sinking of the &quot;Sewol&quot; ferry off the South Korean coast on April 16, 2014.

===Nail salon abuse===
According to a 2015 investigation by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, abuse by Korean nail salon owners in New York City and Long Island was rampant, with 70 to 80% of nail salon owners in New York being Korean, per the Korean American Nail Salon Association; with the growth and concentration in the number of salons in New York City far outstripping the remainder of the United States since 2000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Abuses routinely included underpayment and non-payment to employees for services rendered, exacting poor working conditions, and stratifying pay scales and working conditions for Korean employees above non-Koreans.

=== Recent statistics ===
It is hard to determine the accuracy of this reporting due to the figures being sourced from the Korean Consulate in Korea, and the channels of various Korean-affiliated organizations. For example, tens of thousands of immigrant women who have been married to USFK since the 1950s and who have been adopted since the liberation of the United States have not been identified in the Korean consulate statistics.

==Languages==

Korean Americans can speak a combination of English and Korean depending on where they were born and when they immigrated to the United States. New immigrants often use a mixture of Korean and English (Konglish), a practice also known as code-switching.

==Memorials and celebrities==
Korean American Day, celebrated on January 13, commemorates the arrival of the first Korean immigrants to the United States on January 13, 1903. This day was first proclaimed by President George W. Bush in 2003 and officially recognized by the U.S. Congress in 2005. It honors the significant contributions of Korean Americans in various fields such as small business, the military, faith leadership, medicine, the arts, and politics, reflecting over a century of their impact on American society.

Celebrities are named at List of Korean Americans.

==Politics==
In a poll from the Asia Times before the 2004 U.S. presidential election, Korean Americans narrowly favored Republican candidate George W. Bush by a 41% to 38% margin over Democrat John Kerry, with the remaining 19% undecided or voting for other candidates. However, according to a poll done by the AALDEF, the majority of Korean Americans that voted in the 2004 presidential election favored Democrat John Kerry by a 66% to 33% margin over Republican candidate George W. Bush. And another poll done by the AALDEF suggest the majority of Korean Americans that voted in the 2008 presidential election favored Democrat Barack Obama by a 64% to 35% margin over Republican John McCain In the 2008 U.S. presidential election, Korean Americans favored Democrat Barack Obama over Republican John McCain, around 59% to 41%. However, there are still more registered Republican Korean Americans than registered Democrats. Korean Americans, due to their Republican and Christian leanings, overwhelmingly supported California&#x27;s constitutional gay marriage ban, Proposition 8.

According to a multilingual exit poll from the 2012 election, 77% of Korean Americans voted for Democrat Barack Obama, while only 20% voted for Republican Mitt Romney. The poll also showed that 60% of Korean Americans identify themselves as being Democrats, while only 14% of Korean Americans identify themselves as being Republican.

In the 2016 presidential election, a majority of Korean Americans (75%) voted for Hillary Clinton.

===Korean Americans in Congress===

Elected in 1992, Jay Kim was the first Korean American person elected to Congress. He represented portions of Orange County, California. He was defeated for re-election in the Republican primary in 1998.

In 2018, Andy Kim was elected to Congress from central New Jersey, becoming the first Democratic and second overall Korean American to serve in Congress.

The 2020 elections saw the first three Korean American women elected to Congress, Republicans Young Kim and Michelle Steel of California and Democrat Marilyn Strickland of Washington.

In 2024, Andy Kim became the first Korean-American to be elected as a United States Senator and was sworn in on December 9, 2024. Democrat Dave Min of California was also elected to the House of Representatives that year.

Out of the six Korean Americans elected to the U.S. Congress, only Andy Kim and Dave Min were born in the United States: Jay Kim, Young Kim, Michelle Steel, and Marilyn Strickland were all born in Korea and immigrated, with Strickland having a father in the American military.

# Andy Kim: Kim was born on July 12, 1982, in Boston, Massachusetts to Korean immigrant parents. He has been serving as a member of the Democratic Party representing New Jersey since January 3, 2019. He is the first Korean-American to serve in the United States Senate, having assumed office on December 9, 2024.
# Young Kim: Young Kim was born on October 18, 1962, in Incheon, South Korea. She is a Republican Congresswoman representing California&#x27;s 39th Congressional District, having assumed office on January 3, 2021.
# Michelle Steel: Born in South Korea, Michelle Park Steel is a Republican Congresswoman representing California&#x27;s 48th Congressional District. She has been serving since January 3, 2021.
# Marilyn Strickland: Marilyn Strickland was born in Seoul, South Korea. She is a Democratic Congresswoman representing Washington&#x27;s 10th Congressional District and has been in office since January 3, 2021. Strickland is notably the first African-American to represent Washington State at the federal level and the first Korean-American woman elected to Congress in its history.
# Dave Min: Min was born in Providence, Rhode Island to South Korean immigrants. He is a Democratic Congressman representing California&#x27;s 47th Congressional District since January 3, 2025.
# Jay Kim: Jay Kim, who served in the past, was born in 1939 in Gyeongseong (now Seoul), South Korea, during the Japanese occupation of Korea. He immigrated to the United States in 1961 and later served as a Republican Congressman.

==Religion==

Korean Americans have historically had a very strong Christian—particularly Protestant—heritage. Between 60% and 65% identify as Christian; 40% of those consist of immigrants who were not Christians at the time of their arrival in the United States. There are about 4,000 Korean Christian churches in the United States. According to a 2016 survey, Presbyterian churches accounted for 42%, followed by Baptists (17%) and Methodists (12%). However, according to a study by UC Riverside in 2020, 64% of Korean American Christians identify as Presbyterians, followed by Methodists (11%) and Baptists (7%).

According to a survey conducted in 2022–2023, Korean Americans have the second largest percentage of individuals who identity as Christian. Fifty-nine percent of Korean Americans identify as Christian. These statistics are in contrast with other Asian American groups such as the Chinese, Japanese, Indian, and Vietnamese of whom 15 to 36% identify as Christian.

The majority of Korean Americans across various social categories go to church. Won Moo Hurh attributes this to 4 factors, including the Christian backgrounds of both early and recent immigrants and the ethnic function of the Korean American Church. Many early Korean immigrants were Christians in Korea who came to the US through the support of American missionaries. The churches established by early Korean immigrants thus became associated with ethnic organizations. Korean immigrants who arrived in the US following the US Immigration Act of 1965 also came from urban middle-class backgrounds and were predominantly Christian.

In 2004, there are 89 Korean Buddhist temples in the United States; the largest such temple, Los Angeles&#x27; Sa Chal Temple, was established in 1974. A small minority, about 2 to 10% of Korean Americans are Buddhist. Reasons given for the conversion of immigrant Korean families to Christianity include the responsiveness of Christian churches to immigrant needs as well as their communal nature, whereas Buddhist temples foster individual spirituality and practice and provide fewer social networking and business opportunities, as well as social pressure from other Koreans to convert. Most Korean American Christians do not practice traditional Confucian ancestral rites practiced in Korea (in Korea, most Catholics, Buddhists, and nonbelievers practice these rites).

== Socio-economic status ==
According to a 2019 analysis of 2017–2019 American Community Survey by the Pew Research Center, the median annual household income of all Koreans in the U.S. was $72,200 (less than the $85,800 for all Asians in the U.S.). The median household income of US-born Koreans, however, was $88,100 exceeding the median household income for all Asians in the U.S.

In terms of employment (of civilians aged 16 or older), 62% of all Koreans in the U.S. were employed as compared to 62% for all Asians in the U.S. At an employment rate of 68%, U.S. born Koreans were slightly more likely to be employed than foreign born Koreans who have an employment rate of 59%.

==Cuisine==

&quot;Korean American cuisine&quot; can be described as a fusion of traditional Korean cuisine with American culture and tastes. Dishes such as &quot;Korean tacos&quot; have emerged from the contacts between Korean bodega owners and their Mexican workers in the Los Angeles area, spreading from one food truck (Kogi Korean BBQ) in November 2008 to the national stage eighteen months later.

According to Chef Roy Choi (of Kogi Korean BBQ fame), sundubu-jjigae was a dish developed by Korean immigrants in Los Angeles. In 2021, &quot;Thrillist&quot; named Bergen County, New Jersey as America&#x27;s best Korean barbecue destination.

Often, chefs borrow from Korean flavors and preparation techniques that they will integrate into the style they are most comfortable with (whether it be Tex-Mex, Chinese or purely American). Even a classic staple of the American diet, the hamburger, is available with a Korean twist—bulgogi (Korean BBQ) burgers.

With the popularity of cooking and culinary sampling, chefs, housewives, food junkies and culinary aficionados have been bolder in their choices, favoring more inventive, specialty and ethnic dishes. Already popular in its subset populations peppered throughout the United States, Korean food debuted in the many Koreatowns found in metropolitan areas including in Los Angeles; Garden Grove and Buena Park in Orange County, California; Queens and Manhattan in New York City; Palisades Park and Fort Lee in Bergen County, New Jersey; Annandale, Virginia; Philadelphia; Atlanta; Dallas; and Chicago. Korean cuisine has unique and bold flavors, colors and styles; these include kimchi, an often spicy dish made of salted and fermented vegetables (baechu-kimchi, kkaktugi), long-fermented pastes (gochujang, doenjang), rice cake or noodle dishes and stews (tteok-bokki, naengmyun), marinated and grilled meats (bulgogi, galbi), and many seafood dishes using fish cakes, octopus, squid, shellfish and fish.

The Korean dining scene was noted to have grown sharply in New Jersey during 2018. Broad Avenue in Bergen County&#x27;s Palisades Park Koreatown in New Jersey has evolved into a Korean dessert destination as well; while a five-mile long &quot;Kimchi Belt&quot; has emerged in the Long Island Koreatown in New York.

Korean coffeehouse chain Caffe Bene, also serving misugaru, has attracted Korean American entrepreneurs as franchisees to launch its initial expansion into the United States, starting with Bergen County, New Jersey and the New York City Metropolitan Area.

== Unauthorized immigration ==

In 2012, the Department of Homeland Security estimated that there were 230,000 &quot;unauthorized immigrants&quot; born in South Korea; they are the seventh-largest nationality of unauthorized immigrants behind those from Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, the Philippines and India.

<text>Route 93 is a state highway in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is a north–south highway that runs from an intersection with U.S. Route 1/9 in Ridgefield on Grand Avenue in Ridgefield, Palisades Park, Leonia, and Englewood before ending at an intersection with Van Nostrand Avenue just north of Route 4. The route originated as Route S5 in 1927, running along the Bergen Turnpike until 1929, when it was moved onto the southern portion of Grand Avenue. It remained the same until 1954, after the alignment of Route 93 had been designated that the route was extended along Grand Avenue.

==Route description==

Route 93 begins at an intersection with U.S. Route 1 and 9 in Ridgefield. The route heads northward through an industrial district of Ridgefield, and at an intersection with Ray Avenue, it passes a local football field. A short distance after an intersection with Linden Avenue, Route 93 intersects with the offramp from U.S. Route 46 eastbound in the community of The Ridgefields. The route heads northward through the residential districts as Grand Avenue, crossing under U.S. Route 46. To the northbound lanes, local homes side the highway, while the southbound lanes are sided by industrial factories and businesses. The route intersects with several local roads, entering the community of Palisades Park. After the intersection with Brinkerhoff Terrace, Route 93 becomes surrounded in both directions with local homes, intersecting with West Central Avenue, where Route 93 intersects with County Route 501 and both combine to form a concurrency northwards.
At this point, Route 93 continues northward through the residential areas of Palisades Park, intersecting with several local roads. Until the intersection with West Edsall Boulevard, the route was paralleling local railroad tracks one block away, now following more residential homes. The route passes a couple of athletic fields and turns to the northeast at an intersection with Station Parkway. The route enters Leonia and passes to the east of the Overpeck County Park. Route 93 begins to fall in elevation, entering a residential district before crossing under the New Jersey Turnpike (Interstate 95). After the turnpike, Route 93 continues northward into Englewood. The route continues a short distance further, interchanging with Route 4. A short distance after the interchange, Route 93 officially ends at an intersection with Van Nostrand Avenue. County Route 501 continues on along Grand Avenue.

==History==

Route 93 originated in 1927 as an alignment of State Highway Route S5, which ran along the Bergen Turnpike from State Highway Route 5 northward to an intersection with State Highway Route 1 entirely in Ridgefield. Route S5 was realigned in 1929 from the Bergen Turnpike to Grand Avenue, and remained on this alignment until the 1953 renumbering on January 1, 1953, when Route S5 was renumbered to Route 93. In 1954, the state took over the remainder of Grand Avenue from U.S. Route 46 to Route 4 from Bergen County, and Route 93 was extended. The route has remained intact since the 1953 renumbering.

<text>Real tennis – one of several games sometimes called &quot;the sport of kings&quot; – is the original racquet sport from which the modern game of tennis (also called &quot;lawn tennis&quot;) is derived. It is also known as court tennis in the United States, royal tennis in England and Australia, and courte-paume in France (to distinguish it from longue-paume, and in reference to the older, racquetless game of &quot;jeu de paume&quot;, the ancestor of modern handball and racquet games). Many French real tennis courts are at &quot;jeu de paume&quot; clubs.

The term &quot;real&quot; was first used by journalists in the early 20th century as a retronym to distinguish the ancient game from modern &quot;lawn&quot; tennis (even though, at present, the latter sport is seldom contested on lawns outside the few social-club-managed estates such as Wimbledon).

There are just 45 active real tennis courts in the world, located in the United Kingdom, Australia, the United States and France. There are also currently six disused courts, such as the two in the Republic of Ireland. The sport is supported and governed by various organizations around the world.
==Equipment==
===Balls===
Unlike latex-based technology underlying the modern lawn tennis ball, the game uses a cork-cored ball which is very close in design to the original balls used in the game. The diameter balls are handmade and consist of a core made of cork with fabric tape tightly wound around it, compacted by outer windings of string, and covered with a hand-sewn layer of heavy, woven, woollen cloth, traditionally Melton cloth (not felt, which is unwoven and not strong enough to last as a ball covering). The balls were traditionally white, but around the end of the 20th century &quot;optic yellow&quot; was introduced for improved visibility, as had been done years earlier in lawn tennis. The balls are much less bouncy than lawn tennis balls, and weigh about ; lawn tennis balls typically weigh .

Despite trials by Dunlop to introduce machine-made balls in the 1970s, almost all balls are entirely hand made by club professionals. The inner core of a ball can last several years, but the cover must be replaced every two to three weeks, depending on usage. Balls are produced in sets of around 60 and hand-sewn by the professional at each club. They are not available for purchase by the general public. Balls are stored in a wicker or plastic basket placed in a hole in the floor underneath the net. A trough under the net allows balls hit into the net to roll into the basket. The entire basket of balls is tipped into a tray in the dedans prior to play to reduce time spent fetching balls. As such, ball boys are not required in real tennis.

===Rackets===

The short, asymmetrical racquets are made of wood and use very tight nylon strings to cope with the heavy balls. The racquet is oval-shaped to make it easier to strike balls close to the floor or in corners, and to facilitate a fast shot with a low trajectory that is difficult for an opponent to return. However, the rackets have a small sweet spot, which discourages a large swing in a shot and emphasises accuracy. Rackets are made of a combination of ash, hickory, vulcanized fibre and willow. Gut strings have now entirely been replaced by nylon, allowing strings to be tighter. Rackets are laminated, with improvements in epoxy resulting in stronger, sturdier rackets which last longer and have changed the game to be faster and more hard hitting.

Most of the rackets in the world are produced by Grays of Cambridge, based in Cambridge in the United Kingdom. Companies that have previously produced real tennis rackets include Dunlop, Slazenger and Gold Leaf Athletics. The introduction of graphite rackets in lawn tennis has reduced the demand for wooden rackets of any sport, resulting in the larger companies leaving the industry.
More recently, Harrow Sports has introduced graphite rackets which are not currently permitted by the rules of the game, but are being trialled at the club level.

Due to the small nature of the game, rackets are almost exclusively sold by club professionals who also provide restringing services to club members. Even at the elite level, professionals string their own rackets.

===Courts===
There are two basic designs in existence today: &quot;jeu quarré,&quot; which is an older design, and &quot;jeu à dedans&quot;. Both are doubly asymmetric: each end of the court differs in shape from the other, and the left and right sides of the court are also different. All existing tennis courts in the modern day are of the &quot;jeu à dedans&quot; variety, except the court at Falkland Palace in Scotland. The &quot;jeu à dedans&quot; court is a rectangular indoor court with high walls on all four sides and a high ceiling. The floor size of a court can vary from at Oxford to and can be constructed of dyed concrete or, in some older courts, flagstone. The surrounding walls are usually constructed of brick or cinder block and are plastered smooth. Some courts, notably Prested and Washington feature glass walls down to floor level, though many more have recently installed glass walls higher up to increase viewing capacity without impacting play.

Three walls feature sloping wooden roofs, known as &quot;penthouses&quot;, built above the floor and extending to a width of . The wall without a penthouse is called the &quot;main wall&quot;. Protruding from the &quot;main wall&quot; is the &quot;tambour&quot;, an angled wall wide at an angle of approximately 53 degrees, though some courts can be up to 59 degrees.

Counting clockwise from the main wall, the penthouses are called the &quot;dedans penthouse&quot;, the &quot;service penthouse&quot; and the &quot;grille penthouse&quot;. The side featuring the &quot;dedans penthouse&quot; is also known as the &quot;service end&quot;, and the side featuring the &quot;grille penthouse&quot; is also known as the &quot;hazard end&quot;. Beneath the penthouses are various &quot;openings&quot; in the wall, which have various mechanics in the gameplay and allow spectators to view the game. Underneath the &quot;dedans penthouse&quot; is the &quot;dedans&quot;, between wide positioned centrally along the wall. A net across the opening allows spectators to view the game without fear of injury. Beneath the &quot;grille penthouse&quot; is the &quot;grille&quot;, a roughly square opening measuring between and positioned the upper right hand side as viewed from the court. The grille is generally blocked by a solid wood cover and features a picture or club logo, though American courts generally have netting instead. Beneath the &quot;service penthouse&quot; is a long opening, divided up into smaller openings by wooden or metal posts. The central such opening, known as the &quot;line&quot;, extends to the floor and allows players to enter the court and change ends. Counted from the centre of the court, the openings are known symmetrically as &quot;first gallery&quot;, &quot;the door&quot;, &quot;second gallery&quot; and &quot;last gallery&quot;, though at the end of the court closest to the &quot;grille penthouse&quot; the final opening is instead called the &quot;winning gallery&quot; and contains a bell which rings when a ball enters the opening.

Strung across the centre of the court is a net, which sags in the middle. At the centre of the court, the net is positioned above the playing surface, rising to at the sides of the court. Most courts feature a trough and a sunken basket at the base of the net for collecting balls at the change of ends.

The &quot;service court&quot; is marked on the hazard side by a line called the &quot;service line&quot; approximately from the back wall, and a line parallel to the main wall called the &quot;fault line&quot;. Often, the service court is painted a different colour to the rest of the floor. A series of lines called &quot;chase lines&quot; measuring distance from the back of the court on the service side and the service line on the hazard side towards the net. Courts in the United Kingdom, United States and Australia mark the distance in intervals yards from the back wall. The lines are numbered on the side walls up to 6 on the service side and 2 on the hazard side, with the seventh line corresponding to the &quot;last gallery&quot; and &quot;second gallery&quot; respectively. Subsequent lines correspond to the gallery openings up to &quot;first gallery&quot;. Often, the &quot;last gallery&quot; and &quot;second gallery&quot; lines on the service end are a different colour to the remainder of the lines to make them easier to identify. At Prested in Essex, the floor is painted in alternating green and blue colours in lieu of chase lines. In France, the lines are measured in pied du roi, numbering up to 14 on the service side and 4 on the hazard side.

As many courts were built before the introduction of electric lighting, most courts feature clerestory windows above the main and service walls. Typically, these areas are considered &quot;out of court&quot;, and are demarcated with an &quot;out of court line&quot; that extends around the top of the playing area. Often, the out of court area is not plastered like the playing area. Notable exceptions include Hobart, where the wall between the windows is considered in play, and Hyde Bridport, where the two windows at the ends of the court are still in play. Alternatively, some courts feature skylights in the roof of the building. All courts now feature artificial lighting, allowing play at all times of day. Some modern courts, such as Radley and Oratory do not feature windows at all, and are lit entirely artificially. Most courts have gabled roofs, with the ridge line along the length of the court. As such, each court has local rules as to whether balls hit over the beams are in or out of play.

The court at Falkland Palace is the last remaining &quot;jeu quarré&quot; design which unlike &quot;jeu à dedans court&quot; lacks a tambour, a dedans and a dedans penthouse. Instead, it features an &quot;ais&quot;, a piece of wood on what would be the dedans wall adjacent to the service penthouse, and four &quot;lunes&quot;, openings in the walls high above what would be the dedans. The court is the only existing, playable court in the world to not have a roof.

==Manner of play==

===Service===
To begin play, the players spin a racket or toss a coin to decide who serves first. Serves are always made from the service end of the court, that is, the side of the court with the dedans. Unlike lawn tennis, at least one foot must be grounded during the service, but the player may serve from anywhere in the court between the dedans wall and the second gallery line. The serve is played onto the service penthouse, and must touch the service penthouse at least once on the receiver&#x27;s (hazard) side of the court. It may also touch the service wall above the penthouse or the service penthouse on the server&#x27;s side. From there, it may touch any other surface including the back wall, back penthouse or battery wall. Serves may be volleyed by the receiver, or be played off a single bounce on the floor. To be a valid serve, the ball must land in the rectangle marked by the service line and the fault line. Serves which land between the fault line and the main wall, beyond the service line, or fail to touch the service penthouse are called fault. Players are permitted a second serve, but if it is also a fault, then the server double faults and the receiver wins the point. Under French rules, balls which land between the fault line and the main wall are not considered a fault, and are instead called a &quot;pass&quot;, with the serve replayed.

In doubles play, the two players in the pair alternate serving or receiving at the end of each game. The first player will serve or receive the entirety of the first game, with the second player serving or receiving the entirety of the second game and so on. This means that a player from one team will only serve or receive from one player from the other team for the entire set. The exception is if a serve lands between the center line and the fault line, in which case either receiving player may elect to play the ball. At the start of each new set, the players may switch who is serving first and second. The pair at the service end must nominate the first server before the pair at the hazard end nominates the first receiver, so players will occasionally play tactically to ensure that they are at the hazard end at the end of each set to ensure they can choose the match-ups for the new set.

Because there are numerous surfaces for the ball to touch during a serve, there are many different styles of serves which are chosen to achieve different tactical advantages. Since the court is asymmetric, different techniques are required for right and left-handed players. Some of the most common serves include:
; Railroad
: Served from the back of the court close to the service wall, the railroad is played overhead with a fast right-to-left action. For right handed players, the stance is usually front-on with the service motion led by the elbow to impart side-spin on the ball, whereas for left handed players, the service is similar to a slice serve in lawn tennis. An ideal railroad will bounce no more than a few inches from the bottom of the penthouse, then kick off the floor back towards the galleries, forcing the receiver to play the wall close to the side penthouse and out of position up the court.
; Bobble
: Served from the center of the court, often around last gallery, the bobble is played with no spin and hit softly at around hip height. It should bounce or roll several times on the service penthouse but not the service wall, forming an arc and falling close to the grille wall with as little forward momentum as possible. Often served as a second serve, it is often the first serve learnt by beginners.
; Demi-piqué
: Served from the centre of the court, near last gallery, the demi-piqué is played with left-to-right spin - for right handers it is played at head height while for left handers it is played below the waist. A demi-piqué strikes the service penthouse once near hazard first gallery, then the side wall, then may or may not hit the service penthouse a second time on the way down. The uncertainty of the trajectory on the way down makes it difficult to volley.
; Underarm twist
: Served mostly by right handers from the back of the court near the service wall, the underarm twist is played with right-to-left spin and played around knee height. For variation, it may or may not hit the service wall. It is typically much slower in pace than a railroad, despite having similar spin that kicks back towards the galleries. Left handers achieve a similar effect with a railroad, which is typically easier to learn than for right handers.
; Side wall
: Served from the back of the court near the side penthouse, the side wall serve is played with a left-to-right spin at around head height. It is hit directly onto the side wall above the net, then hitting the service penthouse on the way down. If allowed to hit the back wall, the serve will spin towards the grille, making it more difficult to hit to the right hander&#x27;s forehand corner.
; High serve/Chandelle
: Served from the main wall at around last gallery, the high serve, also known as a chandelle, is hit as close to the roof as possible, falling once on the service penthouse and then close to the back wall. The serve can be played with either side spin or under spin, resulting in different variations when bouncing off the service penthouse.
; High side wall
: Similar to the high serve, the high side wall will hit the service wall before the service penthouse, resulting in the ball running along the grille wall. Difficult to return when served well, if served too long results in a fault (or pass in France), while if served too short is generally easy for the receiver.
; Giraffe
: Also similar to the high serve, except served from close to the service penthouse at about second gallery. 
; Drag
: Served from very close to the service wall, the drag is played with heavy backspin. For right handers, this is typically achieved by serving as a backhand, while for left handers it can be served forehand. When served short, the backspin causes the ball to loose forward momentum, while when served long will spin off the back wall towards the tambour
; Boomerang
: Served from the center of the court, the boomerang is played deep onto the service penthouse, before bouncing up to the grille penthouse, then the back wall, returning to the service penthouse and falling flush with the grille wall. When served well, it is impossible to return, so there is a gentlemen&#x27;s agreement that the serve is not used in high level play.
; Piqué
: Served from near the main around the second gallery line, the piqué is played with an overhead action, hit hard directly at the service penthouse. The ball then flies high in the air and lands near the grille wall close to the fault line. It is often used to target a weaker receiver in doubles play.
; Caterpillar
: Served from near the second gallery line in the centre of the court, the serve is played with a side wall action for right-handers or a railroad action for left-handers. The ball is played deep into the service penthouse, then striking the service wall, the grille penthouse, the back wall before finally falling flush with the grille wall close to the fault line. Rarely seen in singles play, it is often used to target a weaker receiver in doubles play.
; African hunting dog
: Served from the back of the court near the service wall, the African hunting dog is played overhead with a left-to-right spin, similar to a slice serve in lawn tennis. It typically bounces several times on the service penthouse before spinning off the back wall towards the center of the court. As it does not keep the ball close to any walls, it is generally easy for the receiver, and is often only seen by players with prior experience in lawn tennis, and not at all in high level play.

===Returns===

Once the ball has been served, the players have to return it to the opposite side by striking it with the racket. Unlike for lawn tennis, the ball does not have to bounce off the floor before it can be returned. It can be played in any direction, as long as its trajectory would bring it to hit the floor on the opposing side first.

===Chases===
Because of the asymmetry of the court, play generally favours the player at the service end of the court. The presence of the tambour at the hazard end introduces uncertainty for the receiving player. Unlike lawn tennis, where players alternately serve and receive entire games, in real tennis players must win the right to serve. To do so, the receiver must lay a &quot;chase&quot;, though a server can also lose the right to server by laying a &quot;hazard chase&quot;. There are four ways to lay a chase:
* The receiver hits a &#x27;winner&#x27;, that is, a shot which is not reached by the server. The chase is marked at the point the ball becomes dead, i.e., the second bounce on the floor, as measured from the back wall using the chase lines.
* The receiver hits the ball into the galleries on the service side of the net (last gallery, second gallery, the door, or the line). The chase is marked by the line corresponding to the gallery the ball entered. Hitting a gallery post corresponds to entering the gallery closer to the net.
* The server hits the ball into any of the galleries on the hazard side of the net except the winning gallery (which would win the point). The server loses the right to serve and has laid a hazard chase, which is marked by the line corresponding to the gallery the ball entered.
* The server hits a ball not retrieved by the receiver but becomes dead between the net and the service line. The server loses the right to serve and has laid a hazard chase, which is marked by the point the ball becomes dead as measured from the service line.

Laying a chase or hazard chase does not immediately score points nor trigger a change of ends. Instead, the length of the chase is recorded and play continues until either:
* The score reaches game point, or
* Two chases (including hazard chases) have been laid.

When the condition is met, the players change ends and resolve the chases in the order in which they were laid. To resolve a chase, the point is played with the additional condition that shots hit by the receiver must not become dead (i.e. second bounce or entering a gallery) further from the back wall than the point at which the chase had been set, in which case the receiver would lose the chase (and also the point). In the case of a hazard chase, any winner hit by the receiver wins the point, but any ball that becomes dead between the point where the chase was marked and the grille wall loses the point. Any shot which is equal to the length of the chase being played is called &quot;chase off&quot; - no change is made to the score but the chase is not replayed. The presence of chases encourages players to play the ball as deep into the court as possible, as short chases close to the back wall are heavily weighted towards the server, and discourages shots such as a smash or a drop shot.

===Openings===

There are three so-called &quot;winning openings&quot; that win the point automatically for the player on the opposite side of the net if the ball lands there. These are:
; Dedans
: The largest of the three openings, and the only one at the service end. Players aiming for the dedans typically hit the ball hard and flat with slight top-spin, a shot known as a &quot;force&quot;. Forces may be hit either directly down the court or off the main wall, the latter being a &quot;boasted force&quot;. Such shots typically result in the serving player deploying a defensive volley from the back of the court. At lower standards of play, players may also attempt to hit the dedans using a lob shot, either directly into the dedans or after bouncing once on the floor. Shots hit too high go onto the dedans penthouse, and are usually an easy ball for the server to play.
; Grille
: The smallest of the three openings, positioned next to the tambour. Because balls struck towards the grille threaten to hit either the tambour or the grille, the receiving player must use their judgement as to which shot to defend. In doubles play, each player covers one of the two features.
; Winning gallery
: Positioned mirroring the last gallery but on the hazard side, the winning gallery can be identified by the presence of a bell in the netting of the gallery that rings when the gallery is struck. The gallery is rarely defended, but difficult to hit, as inaccurate shots could go into hazard second gallery, conceding a hazard chase and losing the right to serve.

===Play===

The heavy, solid balls take a great deal of spin, which often causes them to rebound from the walls at unexpected angles. For the sake of a good chase (close to the back wall), it is desirable to use a cutting stroke, which imparts backspin to the ball, causing it to come sharply down after hitting the back wall. Players at the hazard end will generally try to hit the ball as deep into the court as possible to lay difficult chases and recover the serve. Players at the service end will use the uncertainty caused by the tambour to deceive their opponents. Different serves and strategies are deployed to prevent players hitting chases, galleries or openings, particularly when playing off chases. Moreover, because of the weight of the balls, the small racquets, and the need to defend the rear of the court, many lawn tennis strategies, such as playing with topspin, and serve-and-volley tactics, are ineffective, except in doubles play.

Play must be continuous, so at the conclusion of one point, the server immediately collects a new ball and moves into position to serve the next point. Time wasting is generally not observed. Players may generally take a short break at the change of ends for refreshments, but may not leave the court except with the permission of the marker (and usually at the end of the set). The general etiquette is that the player changing from the service end to the hazard end will wait for the other player to come around the net, and place a ball on their racket for them to serve.

===Marker===

The score of the match is kept by a marker. The role of the marker is to mark the position of chases, call service faults, record the score and manage the conduct of the players. Traditionally, the marker stands at the net opening to get a view of the whole court. However, from this position the marker cannot see the service penthouse, so must rely on the sound of the ball or an assistant marker to call service faults. For safety reasons, most clubs and tournaments have moved the marker to a seat in the dedans. In this case, the players call the length of any hazard chases, unless an assistant marker is employed in the grille. As the game is small, most professionals are also trained markers, hence it is not uncommon to see players in a tournament marking other matches in the same draw, even at the elite level.

===Scoring===
====Game====
The scoring system of real tennis mirrors that of lawn tennis, the latter having inherited the system from the former. A game is won by the first player to have won a total of four points, and to be at least two points more than their opponent. The points are called &quot;love&quot;, &quot;15&quot;, &quot;30&quot; and &quot;40&quot; respectively. If both players have reached 40 in the game, the score is called as &quot;deuce&quot;. After a game has reached deuce, the player with one more point than their opponent has &quot;advantage&quot;. The score is typically called as &quot;&quot;advantage server&quot; or &quot;advantage receiver&quot;&quot; as appropriate. Unlike lawn tennis, where the first score called corresponds to the server, in real tennis the first score called corresponds to the player who has won the most recent point. As chases are resolved at or before game point, no chases carry through to subsequent games.

In handicap matches, players may require different numbers of points to win a game. A player with &quot;receiving odds&quot; starts a game requiring less than four points to win the game, while a player with &quot;owing odds&quot; requires more than four points to win the game. Such odds are counted backwards, so a player requiring five points starts at &quot;owe 15&quot;, while a player requiring six points starts at &quot;owe 30&quot;. A player with &quot;half-odds&quot; starts each second game with the nominated score, that is, a player playing &quot;owe half 15&quot; starts the first game at love, and the second game at owe 15. In handicap matches, deuces are never played - a score of 40-all is winner-takes-all.

====Set====
A set is a series of games counted up to a predetermined number, usually 6. The sets are counted in the ordinary manner (i.e. 1, 2, 3 etc.). There are no tiebreakers or advantage sets played, so at a score of 5-all, the player who wins the next game wins the set. Because the service is decided by the chase rule, rather than alternating between the players, there is little residual advantage from serving first by the time the set is nearly over.

Depending on the tournament, the number of games required to win a set can be varied by the tournament organisers. 8 is a popular choice, also known as a pro set, though variations include sets to any number between 5 and 10. Some tournaments permit an unlimited number of games in the set, with the match only concluding if a timer has expired. If the match is to be played across more than one set, the set is only ever to 6 games.

====Match====

A match is a sequence of sets. A match is determined through a best of &quot;n&quot; sets system. In tournaments with a round robin stage (often as the qualification to a knock-out stage) matches are usually played to one set. Minor tournaments, Ladies Open tournaments and Ladies World Championships are played as best of three sets. Major tournaments, leading amateur tournaments, Open tournaments and matches up to the semi-finals of the Doubles World Championships are played as best of five sets. Matches in the first round of the Singles World Championships are played as best of nine sets, played across two days with four or five sets on the first day, and from zero to four sets on the second day. The Singles World Championships Final Eliminator and Final Challenge are played as best of thirteen sets, played across three days, with rest days in between.

==History==

The term &quot;tennis&quot; is thought to derive from the French word &quot;tenez,&quot; which means &quot;take heed&quot; – a warning from the server to the receiver. Real tennis evolved, over three centuries, from an earlier ball game played around the 12th century in France. This had some similarities to palla, fives, Spanish pelota or handball, in that it involved hitting a ball with a bare hand and later with a glove. This game may have been played by monks in monastery cloisters, but the construction and appearance of courts more resemble medieval courtyards and streets than religious buildings. By the 16th century, the glove had become a racquet, the game had moved to an enclosed playing area, and the rules had stabilized. Real tennis spread across Europe, with the Papal Legate reporting in 1596 that there were 250 courts in Paris alone, near the peak of its popularity in France.

Royal interest in England began with Henry V (reigned 1413–22) but it was Henry VIII (reigned 1509–47) who made the biggest impact as a young monarch, playing the game with gusto at Hampton Court on a court he had built in 1530 and on several other courts in his palaces. His second wife Anne Boleyn was watching a game of real tennis when she was arrested and it is believed that Henry was playing tennis when news was brought to him of her execution. Queen Elizabeth I was a keen spectator of the game. During the reign of James I (1603–25), there were 14 courts in London.

In France, François I (1515–47) was an enthusiastic player and promoter of real tennis, building courts and encouraging play among both courtiers and commoners. His successor, Henry II (1547–59), was also an excellent player and continued the royal French tradition. The first known book about tennis, &quot;Trattato del Giuoco della Palla&quot; was written during his reign, in 1555, by an Italian priest, Antonio Scaino da Salo. Two French kings supposedly died from tennis-related episodes – Louis X of a severe chill after playing and Charles VIII after striking his head on the lintel of a door leading to the court in the royal Château at Amboise. King Charles IX granted a constitution to the Corporation of Tennis Professionals in 1571, creating a career for the &#x27;maître paumiers&#x27; and, establishing three levels of professionals – apprentice, associate, and master. The first codification of the rules of real tennis was written by a professional named Forbet and published in 1599.

The game thrived among the 17th-century nobility in France, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, and the Habsburg Empire, but suffered under English Puritanism, as it was heavily associated with gambling. By the Age of Napoleon, the royal families of Europe were besieged and real tennis, a court game, was largely abandoned. Real tennis played a role in the history of the French Revolution, through the Tennis Court Oath, a pledge signed by French deputies in a real tennis court, which formed a decisive early step in starting the revolution.

An epitaph in St Michael&#x27;s Church, Coventry, written circa 1705 read, in part:

During the 18th century and early 19th century, as real tennis declined, two new racquet sports emerged in England: rackets and squash racquets.

There is documented history of courts existing in the German states from the 17th century, though none exist today.

In Victorian England, real tennis had a revival, but broad public interest later shifted to the new and much less difficult outdoor game of lawn tennis, which soon became the more popular sport, and was also played by both genders (whereas real tennis players were almost exclusively male).

Real tennis courts were built in Hobart, Tasmania (1875) and in the United States, starting in 1876 in Boston, and in New York in 1890, and later at athletic clubs in several other cities. Real tennis greatly influenced the game of stické, which was invented in the 19th century and combined aspects of real tennis, lawn tennis and rackets.

Real tennis also has the longest running world championship of any sport in the world, dating from 1740.

===Victorian court master-builder===
A forgotten master of designing, building and restoring real tennis courts was the British Fulham-based builder, Joseph Bickley (1835–1923). He became a specialist around 1889 and patented a plaster mix to withstand condensation and dampness. Examples of his surviving work include: The Queen&#x27;s Club, Lord&#x27;s, Hampton Court Palace, Jesmond Dene, Newmarket, Moreton Hall, Warwickshire and Petworth House. There are also examples of his projects in Scotland and in the United States.

==Competitions==

===World Championships===
The pinnacle of the sport is the biennial World Championship. The first champion is known only as Clergé, becoming the champion in approximately 1740. Scores for challenge formats are only known from 1862 onwards. In general the format for the match has been a best of 13 set format, held over three days of play. The event is held as a challenge format, whereby the incumbent champion awaits a suitable challenger in a manner similar to chess or boxing. Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, the incumbent champion dictated the terms, location and times of his challenge, which required any challengers to be backed by sponsors who provided a sufficient prize purse to fund a challenge. The most notable champion of this period was Pierre Etchebaster, who held the title for 24 years between 1928 and 1954 winning 8 challenges.

In 1959, responsibility for running the world championship was handed to the national governing body of the incumbent champion. In 1980, rules for eligibility of challengers were defined as any winner of a national Open title. However, after incumbent champion Robert Fahey won two consecutive grand slams in 2000 and 2001, no suitable challengers were available, so the rules were changed to hand responsibility for the terms, timing and location of challengers to the International Real Tennis Professionals Association. Qualification to the World Championship eliminators is now via the World Race, where competitors accumulate points for their placings at eligible tournaments, with the top four players competing in a series of eliminators for the right to challenge for the championship. The most dominant player of this period has been Robert Fahey, who held the title for 26 years between 1994 and 2016 and again from 2018 to 2022, winning the title a record 13 times. The current World Champion is American Camden Riviere, who defended his title against John Lumley in 2023. The next challenge is expected to be held at the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island in September 2025.

A World Doubles championship was first contested in 2001 at Middlesex University and has been held every second year since. The host venue rotates between the four tennis playing countries in the order United Kingdom-Australia-France-United States. Unlike the singles championship, the doubles championship is an Open knock-out format, initially restricted to the top 8 pairs based on world ranking, but restricted to the top 4 pairs since 2022. Matches are played as a best of 9 set format. The most successful players include 6-time champions Tim Chisholm, Robert Fahey and Steve Virgona. The incumbent champions are Tim Chisholm and Camden Riviere who won the 2024 World Championship in Chicago.

The Ladies World Championship was first held in Melbourne in 1985, being held every second year since. The host venue rotates between the four tennis playing countries in the order Australia-France-United Kingdom-United States. Both singles and doubles competitions are contested at the same event as an unrestricted Open knock-out draw. The most successful players include 6-time champion Penny Lumley and 7-time and incumbent champion Claire Fahey. The most recent championship was held at The Oratory School in 2023, with Fahey winning the singles, and Fahey and Tara Lumley winning the doubles.

===National Opens===
All four tennis-playing countries (Australia, France, United Kingdom and United States) host a National Open event each year, with categories for men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s singles and doubles. In the first half of the 20th century, it was uncommon for players to compete at Opens outside of their home country. After the National Opens became a pathway for challenging for the World Championship in 1980, international play has increased. Chris Ronaldson became the first play to win a grand slam in 1984, following the creation of the French Open in 1981. Robert Fahey holds the record for most Open titles won, having won 50 singles title including grand slams in 2000, 2001 and 2008. Camden Riviere became the third player to win a grand slam in 2017 and again in 2019.

Women&#x27;s Open events began in 1978, with Opens contested in all four countries by 1990. Unlike the men&#x27;s game which is mostly contested by professionals, the women&#x27;s game remains predominantly amateur, exceptions being Claire Fahey, Kate Leeming and Lesley Ronaldson. Charlotte Cornwallis became the first woman to win a grand slam in 2006. Claire Fahey holds the record for most Open titles won, winning 42 titles including 6 grand slams in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2017 and 2019.

===Other professional competitions===

The world rankings are administered by the International Real Tennis Professionals Association, with ranking points based on the total prize fund at the tournament. National Opens receive a 1.5 times multiplier to their ranking points. Current tournaments with world ranking points include:

In addition, a number of professional events are held each year which do not carry world ranking points, including the US National (only open to US based professionals), the Category A Open Championships (only open to handicaps 0–15), the Tasmanian Open, the Victorian Open, the Tambour Tour, the Jesmond Dene Cup, the Seacourt Silver Racquet (handicapped), the IRTPA National League and the USCTA National League.

There is currently no formalised structure for the women&#x27;s events, with each Open championship being organised independently by the relevant national governing body.

===International team competitions===

The major international team competition is the Bathurst Cup, with teams of amateur players from each tennis playing country competing in singles and doubles. The first Bathust Cup was held in 1922 between Great Britain and France at Queen&#x27;s, sponsored by Lilias, Countess Bathurst. The United States first participated in 1923, and Australia in 1969. The event is held every two years, rotating in the order United Kingdom-Australia-France-United States. The first women&#x27;s Bathurst Cup was held in 2022 between Great Britain and a team representing the Rest of the World. In 2009, a series of bilateral team competitions began for players aged under 26 known as the Van Alen (GB vs USA), Morris Clothier (USA vs Australia) and George Limb Trophies (GB vs Australia). There are currently no international team competitions open to professionals.

===Other competitions===

For amateur players, each tennis playing country hosts an annual amateur championship, with other elite tournaments including the Tuxedo Gold Racquet and the MCC Gold Racquet. The largest mass participation real tennis events include:
* Boomerang Cup, a handicap team doubles event held every second year at the Royal Melbourne Tennis Club
* Tournoi Trois Tripot, a handicap team doubles event held at trinquete (Basque pelota courts) in the French Basque Country 
* World Masters, singles, doubles and team competitions for age categories from 50 to 80+ years held every second year on annual rotation
* Leamington Open, singles and doubles handicapped competitions credited with the development of the modern handicap system

==In literature==
Tennis is mentioned in literature from the 16th century onwards. It is frequently shown in emblem books, such as those of Guillaume de La Perrière from 1539. Erasmus lets two students practice Latin during a game of tennis with a racquet in 1522, although the playing ground is not mentioned. A 1581 translation of Ovid&#x27;s Metamorphoses by Giovanni Andrea dell&#x27;Anguillara, printed in Venice in quarto form transforms the fatal discus game between Apollo and Hyacinth into a fatal game of real tennis, or &quot;racchetta.&quot;

William Shakespeare mentions the game in Act I Scene II of &quot;Henry V&quot;; the Dauphin, a French Prince, sends King Henry a gift of tennis-balls, out of jest, in response to Henry&#x27;s claim to the French throne. King Henry replies to the French Ambassadors:
&quot;His present and your pains we thank you for: When we have matched our rackets to these balls, we will, in France, by God&#x27;s grace, play a set [that] shall strike his father&#x27;s crown into the hazard ... And tell the pleasant Prince this mock of his hath turn&#x27;d his balls to gun stones&quot;. Michael Drayton makes a similar reference to the event in his &quot;The bataille of Agincourt&quot;, published in 1627.

The &quot;Penguin book of Sick Verse&quot; includes a poem by William Lathum comparing life to a tennis-court:

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;
If in my weak conceit, (for selfe disport),
The world I sample to a Tennis-court,
Where fate and fortune daily meet to play,
I doe conceive, I doe not much misse-say.
All manner chance are Rackets, wherewithall
They bandie men, from wall to wall;
Some over Lyne, to honour and great place,
Some under Lyne, to infame and disgrace;
Some with a cutting stroke they nimbly sent
Into the hazard placed at the end; ...
&lt;/poem&gt;

The Scottish gothic novel &quot;The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner&quot; by James Hogg (1824) describes a tennis match that degenerates into violence.

The detective story &quot;Dead Nick&quot; takes place in a tennis milieu. The title alludes to a shot that hits &quot;the nick&quot; (where the wall meets the floor), called &quot;dead&quot; because it then bounces very little and is frequently unreturnable.

&quot;Hazard Chase&quot; (1964), by Jeremy Potter, is a thriller-detective story featuring real tennis on the court at Hampton Court Palace. During the story the game is explained, and the book contains a diagram of a real tennis court. Jeremy Potter wrote historical works (including &quot;Tennis and Oxford&quot; (1994)), and was himself an accomplished player of the game, winning the World Amateur Over-60s Championship in 1986.

&quot;The First Beautiful Game: Stories of Obsession in Real Tennis&quot; (2006) by top amateur player Roman Krznaric contains a mixture of real tennis history, memoir and fiction, which focuses on what can be learned from real tennis about the art of living.

&quot;The Corpse on the Court&quot; (2013) is a mystery by Simon Brett. It features the recurring lead character of Jude learning many details about the sport from aficionados.

In &quot;The Chase&quot; by Ivor P. Cooper, in &quot;Ring of Fire II&quot; in the &quot;1632 series&quot;, up-timers Heather Mason and Judy Wendell learn the sport from Thomas Hobbes. Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden is depicted as an aficionado of the game.

&quot;Sudden Death&quot; (2013), a novel by Alvaro Enrigue, is interstitched throughout with descriptions of a real tennis match between the Italian artist Caravaggio and the Spanish poet Quevedo. The details of play are interspersed among historical reflections on the game, descriptions of techniques for making the balls, quotations from contemporary sources, gambling that accompanied the game, the backgrounds of the participants and the strategy discussions between the players and their seconds. It is intentionally unclear which details are real and which are imagined by the author.

==In film and television==

Real tennis is featured in the film &quot;The Seven-Per-Cent Solution&quot;, a fictional meeting between Sherlock Holmes and Sigmund Freud. One of the film&#x27;s plot points turns on Freud playing a grudge match with a Prussian nobleman (in lieu of a duel).

The film &quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot; includes a sequence featuring a few points being played. Also &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1973) and &quot;Ever After&quot; briefly feature the game. Although presented with varying degrees of accuracy, these films provide a chance to see the game played, which otherwise may be difficult to observe personally.

The Showtime series &quot;The Tudors&quot; (2007) portrays Henry VIII playing the game. The film &quot;The Man Who Knew Infinity&quot; features a short sequence of G. H. Hardy (Jeremy Irons) and John Edensor Littlewood (Toby Jones) playing real tennis.

==Televised / streamed matches==
Real tennis has occasionally been televised, but the court (which does not well lend itself to the placement of cameras), the speed at which the ball travels, and the complexity of the rules all militate against the effectiveness and popularity of televised programming.

Web-streaming is proving a helpful innovation, and realtennis.tv broadcast its first tournament, the European Open, from 8–9 March 2011.

Many top national and international tournaments can be seen live or on replay via YouTube channels.

<doc id="234583" wikidata="Q825424" url="?curid=234583" title="New Jersey Route 94">
<text>Route 94 is a state highway in the northwestern part of New Jersey, United States. It runs from the Portland–Columbia Toll Bridge over the Delaware River in Knowlton Township, Warren County, where it connects to PA 611, northeast to the New York state line in Vernon, Sussex County. At the New York border, New York State Route 94 (NY 94) continues to Newburgh, New York. Route 94 is mostly a two-lane undivided road that runs through mountain and valley areas of Warren and Sussex counties, serving Columbia, Blairstown, Newton, and Hamburg. The route intersects several roads, including U.S. Route 46 (US 46) and Interstate 80 (I-80) in Knowlton Township, US 206 in Newton, Route 15 in Lafayette Township, and Route 23 in Hamburg.

What is now Route 94 was legislated as part of two separate routes in 1927. The portion of road between Route 6/US 46 near the Delaware Bridge to Newton became Route 8, while the route north of Newton to the New York border became a part of Route 31. Prior to 1953, the only portion of Route 31 north of Newton that was a state highway was between North Church and Hamburg. In 1953, Route 94 was designated to replace all of Route 8 as well as Route 31 north of Newton; the number was chosen to match NY 94, and in turn named after the 94th Infantry Division. After the Portland–Columbia Toll Bridge and the Delaware Water Gap Toll Bridge were both completed in December 1953, the southern terminus of Route 94 was cut back to an intersection with US 611 in Columbia, which had been rerouted into New Jersey across both bridges, following a freeway between Columbia and the Delaware Water Gap Toll Bridge that would later become a part of I-80. The former alignment of Route 94 between the Delaware Bridge and the Portland–Columbia Toll Bridge became a part of US 46. In 1965, US 611 was routed out of New Jersey (though US 611 shields would remain on that freeway along with I-80 shields until 1972), and Route 94 still ended at that three-way intersection. Once new ramps were completed in that area in 1972 along with US 611 being decommissioned (being replaced with PA 611), Route 94 was extended to the state line on the Portland–Columbia Toll Bridge. Through the 1960s and 1970s, a freeway was proposed for the Route 94 corridor. This freeway, proposed to be a part of the Interstate Highway System, was never built.

==Route description==
===Warren County===
Route 94 begins at the two-lane undivided Portland–Columbia Toll Bridge over the Delaware River in Knowlton Township, Warren County, where it connects to PA 611 on the Pennsylvania side of the river. This bridge is maintained by the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission; the rest of Route 94 is maintained by the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT). Immediately after the bridge, the route comes to a complex interchange with the western terminus of US 46 as well as with I-80 a short distance later, near the community of Columbia. In the area of the US 46/I-80 interchange, the directions of Route 94 split, carrying two lanes in each direction. Signage for Route 94 begins at the interchange with I-80.
From here, the route becomes a two-lane undivided road that continues northeast through a mix of woods and farms with some development, passing under the abandoned Lackawanna Cut-Off. After passing through the community of Hainesburg, the road turns more to the east and enters Blairstown. Route 94 turns northeast before reaching the community of Blairstown, where the road continues east past some development before intersecting with Stillwater Road (County Route 521 (CR 521]). It forms a short wrong-way concurrency with that route, along which it crosses the Paulins Kill and CR 521 splits from Route 94 by heading south on Hope Road. A short distance later, Route 94 enters Frelinghuysen Township, passing through more rural surroundings. The road turns northeast through the community of Marksboro before heading east again. After the intersection with Ramsey Road (CR 661), Route 94 makes a sharp turn to the north-northeast.

===Sussex County===
The route continues into Sussex County at Fredon Township, heading through rural areas. The road turns more to the northeast as a two-lane road before heading east again and entering Newton. Here, Route 94 becomes High Street and passes several homes, intersecting with West End Avenue (CR 519). CR 519 runs concurrently with Route 94, and the two routes continue into Downtown Newton. In the downtown area, the road comes to the Park Place Square, where it meets the intersection with US 206. At this point, all three routes turn southeast on Park Place, northeast on Main Street, northwest on Spring Street, and run concurrently north on four-lane undivided Water Street for a short distance. CR 519 splits from the road by turning north on Mill Street, while US 206/Route 94 continues north as a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane, where a shopping district lines the road as it leaves Newton for Hampton Township. The road narrows back to two lanes as it heads into areas of farmland. Route 94 splits from US 206 by making a right turn to continue east.

The road passes a mobile home park before making a turn northeast and heading into Lafayette Township. In Lafayette Township, the route resumes to the east through a mix of rural and industrial areas. The road continues to an intersection with Route 15, where Route 94 makes a right turn to head southeast along Route 15 in a wrong-way concurrency. Upon splitting, Route 15 stays straight and heads southeast as Route 94 turns at a right hand reverse jughandle to head northeast. Route 94 continues through more rural areas with occasional development and enters Sparta, where it is known as North Church Road. Here, the road passes near some residential developments before continuing into Hardyston Township. In Hardyston Township, the route runs through the community of North Church. After making a sharp turn to the east, Route 94 enters Hamburg and becomes Vernon Avenue. The route passes a few homes before intersecting with Route 23 in the center of town. From this intersection, the route makes a turn to the northeast before leaving the town and heading back into Hardyston Township. The road passes rural developed areas before entering Vernon.

At this point, the surroundings become more wooded and mountainous as the road passes near residential areas and reaches the community of McAfee. In McAfee, McAfee-Glenwood Road (CR 517) intersects with Route 94 and the two routes head east for a short wrong-way concurrency, crossing the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway&#x27;s New Jersey Subdivision line before CR 517 turns to the south. Route 94 continues northeast unnamed, briefly becoming a divided highway as it passes the Mountain Creek ski resort and the Mountain Creek Waterpark, passing under a pedestrian bridge between the resort and parking lot. Continuing northeast, the route comes to an intersection with Vernon Road (CR 515), which it runs concurrently with on Vernon-Warwick Road. The two routes continue north; CR 515 splits from Route 94 by turning north on Prices Switch Road a short distance after crossing the Appalachian Trail. From here, Route 94 continues through more countryside before reaching the New York state line, where the road continues into that state as NY 94.

==History==
Through Vernon, what is now Route 94 was designated as the Vernon Turnpike, which was legislated to run from the Paterson-Hamburg Turnpike to the New York state line. It was abandoned by 1828.

In the 1927 renumbering of state highways, Route 8 was defined to run along present-day Route 94 from Route 6 (current US 46) at the Delaware Bridge north to Columbia before turning northeast to Route 31 (now US 206) in Newton. Past Newton, Route 31 continued northeast to the New York state line (current US 206 north of here was Route S31). In the original version of the renumbering bill, Route 31 was to reach the state line via Sussex, incorporating pre-1927 Route 8 (now Route 284) from Sussex to the New York state line. However, in the final version, Route 31 ran via Hamburg, using the same alignment as a planned spur of pre-1927 Route 8 from Lafayette Township to North Church. Route 8 was eventually taken over by the state. On the other hand, by 1949, only one section of Route 31 north of the Route S31 split had been taken between North Church to Hamburg.

In the 1953 renumbering, Route 8 was renumbered to Route 94, which was extended northeast past Newton along former Route 31 to the New York state line, matching NY 94 across the border. It was initially only marked south of Hamburg, as none of the route north of Hamburg was state-maintained. Originally, Route 94 began at the now razed Delaware Bridge, where US 46 would cross into Pennsylvania. Route 94 would wind right and north-east a few to Columbia, where it joined its current route. In December 1953, both the Portland–Columbia Toll Bridge and Delaware Water Gap Toll Bridge opened. That year a section of Old Mine Road was rebuilt and aligned as a four lane freeway between Columbia and the Delaware Water Gap Toll Bridge. 
Following this, US 46 was rerouted over the first several miles of Route 94 between the Delaware Bridge and Columbia, and Route 94 was cut back to Columbia, near the Portland-Columbia Toll Bridge. Here, US 46 would end and US 611, would cross the Portland-Columbia Toll Bridge from Pennsylvania and follow the freeway north to the Delaware Water Gap Toll Bridge. The freeway portion that US 611 followed became a part of I-80 in 1959. When US 611 was removed from New Jersey in 1965, Route 94 was extended to the state line on the Portland-Columbia Toll Bridge. By 1969, the unsigned portions of Route 94 north of Newton were signed. In 1973, this whole area was realigned into a complex interchange as the New Jersey portion of I-80 was completed.

In 1964, a Route 94 freeway was proposed to run from I-80 in Netcong north to the planned Route 23 freeway in Hamburg, following US 206 north to Newton and current Route 94 to Hamburg. In the late 1960s, NJD0T planned for the Route 94 freeway to run from I-80/US 46 in Columbia northeast to the New York state line near Wawayanda State Park. NJD0T hoped to get funding for the freeway in 1970 for it to become an Interstate Highway as it was planned to serve a proposed national recreation area along the Delaware River that would have been built in conjunction with the controversial Tocks Island Dam project. This proposed Interstate, which was to run from I-80 in Hope Township to I-84 in Port Jervis and continue northeast along US 209, was denied funding. After reviewing the proposal again in 1972, NJDOT determined that the freeway would cost $96 million. It was eventually canceled due to environmental concerns and financial constraints.

<text>Route 109 is a state highway located in Cape May County, New Jersey, United States. The route runs from Jackson Street in Cape May north to an intersection with U.S. Route 9 (US 9) in Lower Township. It crosses one of two road bridges over the Cape May Canal (the other is Route 162) and provides access to the southern end of the Garden State Parkway and County Route 621 (CR 621, Ocean Drive) as well as to Cape May. Only the section of road in Lower Township is state maintained; the rest is maintained by Cape May County and signed as County Route 633 (CR 633), which extends past the southern terminus along Jackson Street and Perry Street to CR 626 in West Cape May.

Present-day Route 109 was designated as a part of pre-1927 Route 14 in 1917 before becoming the southernmost portion of Route 4 in 1927. By the 1940s, US 9 extended south to Cape May from Absecon along this part of Route 4. In 1953, the Route 4 designation was dropped from this segment of road to avoid the concurrency with US 9. In 1972, US 9 was rerouted to head to the Cape May–Lewes Ferry terminal, with the former alignment into Cape May becoming Route 109.

== Route description ==
Route 109 begins at an intersection with CR 633 in the city of Cape May, heading to the northeast on Lafayette Street, a two-lane undivided road that is county-maintained and signed as a part of CR 633, which itself extends past the southern terminus of Route 109 along Jackson Street and Perry Street to CR 626 in West Cape May. The route passes through residential and commercial areas of Cape May, passing southeast of the terminus of the Cape May Seashore Lines railroad at the Cape May Welcome Center/Cape May Bus Terminal located at the former Cape May City Rail Terminal and intersecting the northern terminus of CR 653. At the intersection with Sidney Avenue, Route 109 splits into a one-way pair that has two lanes in each direction, with the northbound direction following Sidney Avenue east before turning north on Washington Street and the southbound direction remaining on Lafayette Street. Along this pairing, northbound Route 109 intersects the northern terminus of CR 622. A short distance later, Washington Street turns west to join Lafayette Street, ending the one-way pair, and the route heads north as a two-lane undivided road.
It crosses Cape Island Creek onto an island in Lower Township. Here, the route becomes maintained by the New Jersey Department of Transportation and signed as Route 109, continuing north past several marinas and other resort businesses. The road briefly widens into a four-lane divided highway and intersects U-turn ramps in both directions before the median ends and it crosses over the Cape May Canal on the Cape May County Veterans Memorial Bridge. Upon crossing the canal, Route 109 becomes a divided highway again and intersects CR 621 (Ocean Drive). From here, the road passes a mix of homes and businesses before intersecting the southern terminus of the Garden State Parkway at an at-grade intersection. At this point, the route turns to the west and becomes a two-lane undivided road and heads through woods and marshland with some residences. Route 109 heads into residential neighborhoods before it ends at an intersection with US 9, which continues north on the road past this intersection as well as west along Sandman Boulevard toward the Cape May–Lewes Ferry terminal. At this intersection, a jughandle provides access from northbound Route 109 to southbound US 9.

== History ==
The road that is now Route 109 was built as part of the Cape May Turnpike, running from Cape May north to Cape May Courthouse. The road was legislated as a part of pre-1927 Route 14 in 1917, a route that was to run from Cape May to Egg Harbor City along what is now Route 109, US 9 and Route 50. In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, this portion of pre-1927 Route 14 became the southernmost part of Route 4, a route that was to run from Cape May north to the George Washington Bridge. By the 1940s, US 9 was extended south from Absecon to Cape May, running concurrent with Route 4. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, which eliminated long concurrencies between U.S. and state routes, the Route 4 designation was dropped along this portion of road, leaving US 9 as the sole designation. The current high-level bridge over the Cape May Canal was built in 1960, replacing a wooden swing bridge built by the U.S. Government when the Cape May Canal was constructed during World War II. In 1972, US 9 was relocated from its southern terminus in Cape May to head west to the Cape May–Lewes Ferry terminal in North Cape May, with the former route into Cape May becoming Route 109. On November 7, 2009, the bridge carrying Route 109 over the Cape May Canal was named the Cape May County Veterans Memorial Bridge, honoring all veterans.

<doc id="234593" wikidata="Q1421910" url="?curid=234593" title="Fives">
<text>Fives (historically known as hand-tennis) is an English handball sport derived from &quot;jeu de paume&quot;, similar to the games of handball, Basque pelota, and squash. The game is played in both singles and doubles teams, in an either three- or four-sided court.

== Etymology ==
The origin of the name &quot;fives&quot; for the game is uncertain; but two main theories are commonly presented. The first is that it is derived from the slang expression &quot;a bunch of fives&quot; (meaning a fist), the other that an earlier form of the game, as described by Nichols, used five-a-side teams.

== History ==
Fives is generally considered to have originated from early forms of the French Jeu de paume. Games were most often played against the walls of the north ends of churchyards, or against the walls of belltowers. This often damaged window glazing, so many churches adapted their exteriors to protect against the game. This often came in the form of shutters and pintles inserted into walls, as well as latticework over the windows themselves. The sport also influenced the layout of several churches; at some churches, saplings were planted where Fives would have been played, at the Church of St James, Ashwick, a cross was moved &quot;to the Vifes place... to prevent the Young People from spending so much idle time in that sort of exercise.&quot;

As such, many of the earliest written testaments of the game are directives by clergy taken to prevent playing of the game. Actions against the game (then referred to as either &quot;hand-tennis&quot; and &quot;hand-ball&quot;) have been found as early as 1287, when the Synod of Exeter banned the game due to the damage it caused to church buildings. Other notable examples of wall ball games being banned include Robert Braybrooke, Bishop of London, who in 1385 prohibited the game &quot;&quot;Necnon ad pilam infra et extra ecclesiam ludunt&quot;.&quot; (English: &quot;Neither inside not outside the church&quot;.)

The name &quot;fives&quot; was applied to the game by 1591, as when Elizabeth I visited the village of Elvetham in Hampshire, she was entertained by the Marquess of Hertford by a game played by his servants:&quot;about three o&#x27;clock, ten of his lordship&#x27;s servants, all Somersetshire men, in a square greene court before her majesties windowe, did hang up lines, squaring out the forme of a tennis-court, and making a cross line in the middle; in this square they (being stript out of their dublets) played five to five with hand-ball at bord and cord as they tearme it, to the great liking of her highness&quot; – John Nichols, &quot;The Progresses and Public Processions of Queen Elizabeth, Volume II.&quot;

The version of fives played here is an example of Wessex fives, the common ancestor to all modern fives games. The first known fives court was built at the base of the church tower in West Pennard, Somerset, in 1813. By this time, fives had achieved some popularity in Wales, where it was referred to as &quot;Ffeifs&quot; – many courts and matches were referred to as &quot;fives courts&quot;, although whether these were for playing Welsh handball is unclear.

In the beginning of the 19th century, fives was played as a pub game especially in Somerset, and many courts were built alongside pubs, attracting large numbers of spectators. Gambling was often present at these matches. The courts at these pubs were different from those used later in the century, consisting of a free standing wall (which were, as such, referred to as either &quot;fives walls&quot; or &quot;fives towers&quot;), occasionally with a buttress attached.

During this period, John Cavanagh, reputed to be the greatest fives player of all time, gained popularity. However, after around 1855, the sport experienced a serious loss of players, due to the prominence of other &quot;more sophisticated&quot; sports, such as squash, and was seen as old-fashioned due to its agrarian roots. As described the Badminton Library:The number of those who continue fives players after the age of twenty-five is very small; and, for obvious reasons, these veterans are usually schoolmasters. Again, fives is entirely a game for amateurs. It has no professors who make their living and their renown as its teachers or exponents. It has no matches to be reported in newspapers with a minuteness of detail suitable to events of international importance. No fives player, as such, has ever had his portrait published in an illustrated journal, or has had the meanest article of dress in the hosiers&#x27; shops named after him. Indeed, the game is not one that tends to exalt the individual player.

At the end of the 19th century, fives was gentrified from its origins as a rural sport to an elitist sport at public schools; codified forms of the game such as Eton fives and Rugby fives were introduced in the 1870s, which spread to schools such as Highgate, Westminster, Charterhouse and Harrow. By the end of the 19th Century, fives had become a well-established sport for British public schools. In the 1920s, the sport began to be played at Cambridge University. The first recorded fives match was played between Eton and Harrow in 1885 (F. Thomas and C. Barclay of Eton beat E.M. Butler and B. R. Warren of Harrow).

Fives continued to be played through the 20th century, but failed to develop a large nation standing. This was because it had a tradition of being a recreational sport played in free time, the large number of varieties of the game in play, and because the &quot;more sophisticated&quot; game of rackets was already established.

==Variants==

Several regional varieties of fives exist; however, most games played are either Rugby fives or Eton fives. Of the two, Etonian fives is the older, being played since the 17th century. The two major variants of the game differ primarily in the construction of the court, with Eton fives including a buttress and inside the court, and an open back wall.

Other variants of the game include Warminster and Winchester fives; Winchester fives has similarities to both Rugby and Etonian fives in regards to court construction, while Warminster fives dates to the late 18th century, and uses a specialised set of rules. The majority of fives-playing schools have only one type of court, although three schools have historically had both Eton and Rugby courts: Cheltenham, Dover, and Marlborough.

===Eton fives===

Eton fives is a form of the game which, unlike Rugby fives, is played only in doubles form. The sport was first created at Eton College (hence the name) by boys playing handball between two buttresses of the school chapel with rules for the game being created in 1877 under the title &quot;Rules of the Game of Fives as played at Eton&quot;.

Eton fives is played in three-sided courts around the size of a squash court mimicking the sides of the school chapel, with a buttress (referred to as a &quot;pepper-box&quot;) on the left-hand wall, and a raised step at the front of the court, extending around 80 cm into the court, at a height of 15 cm, creating the &quot;upper&quot; and &quot;lower&quot; parts of the court. A sloping ledge runs around the walls of the court, roughly four and a half feet from the floor, of which the bottom line is dubbed the &quot;playline&quot;, above which shots have to be played. The upper limit of the court is the &quot;coping&quot; – stonework that lines the top of the walls.

The first purpose-built fives courts were built at Eton College in 1840, by then headmaster Edward Craven Hawtrey, who constructed four courts mimicking the sides of the school chapel. These courts varied in a few specifications; the distance between the front wall and the buttress was increased, and the floor&#x27;s slope was reduced, which quickened play speed. The courts were built of sandstone, to reproduce the effect&#x27;s of the chapel&#x27;s walls, which are made of Taynton stone.

The first Eton fives match was played on 12 February 1885, between Eton and Harrow School, playing at Harrow&#x27;s fives courts. Eton fives began to be played at the University of Cambridge in 1920, with varsity matches beginning in 1927. The sport is regulated by the Eton Fives Association, which promotes the sport and runs tournaments annually. While Eton fives has historically been a male-dominated game, due to the public schools it was played in being single-sex, in recent years, women have begun to take a larger role in the sport, accounting for approximately 20% of games played as of 2016.

===Rugby fives===

Rugby fives, nominally developed at Rugby School in Rugby is the most common variant of the sport, played in both singles and doubles. The variant is derived from Wessex fives, and was brought to Rugby in the 19th century by Thomas Arnold, the then headmaster of Rugby School, who had learnt the game playing at Warminster School. Rugby fives is attested to in Thomas Hughes&#x27; 1857 Tom Brown&#x27;s School Days, centered on the author&#x27;s own experiences at Rugby, which align with the period in with Arnolds was headmaster. The sport is governed by the Rugby Fives Association, which stages multiple tournaments for the sport annually.

Rugby fives uses an enclosed court free from &quot;hazards&quot;, with a hollow board running across the front wall, similar to that of squash. The court has a width of 18 feet and a length of 28 feet, with the front wall having a height of 15 feet. The Rugby fives court uses a shortened back wall, which has a height of 4&#x27;10&quot;. Rugby fives is most commonly played in gloves, using a leather-clad ball with a rubber core. This ball is harder than that used in Eton fives, which increases the speed of play in the game.

Fives is played at several public schools throughout England, including Rugby School, Bedford School, and St Paul&#x27;s School (London), as well as by the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, which participate in an annual varsity match in the sport. As of 2022, Rugby fives is played in two state schools, namely Stoke Newington School (whose courts were renovated by The National Lottery in 2007) and Derby Moor Academy.

=== Winchester fives ===
Winchester fives is a version of fives very similar to Rugby fives, played originally at Westminster School. The sport has been played at Westminster since July 1886, when two courts were opened at the site. The court used is almost identical to that used in Rugby fives, except for a 45° change in wall direction for almost 10 inches on the left wall. This makes the back of the court narrower, and creates a very small buttress similarly to that of Eton fives. This buttress also serves to diversify gameplay by allowing winning shots to be made more easily: sharp changes in direction are created by bouncing the ball off the buttress. The game is played in doubles, with matches being played to either 11 or 15 points.

The sport has no organisation of its own, but &quot;The Schools&#x27; Winchester Fives Doubles&quot; tournament is run yearly by the Rugby Fives Association.

=== Warminster fives ===
Warminster fives, also known as West Country fives, is played at Lord Weymouth School, now Warminster School. An 1860 fives court still stands at the school and was in regular use until the 1970s. The court used in Warminster fives is unique in its construction: the court is similar to a fives wall, except for two small walls jutting from the front wall at 45° angles. The court itself is a grade II listed building, first being listed in 1978.

Warminster fives is likely to have inspired Rugby fives: Thomas Arnold, headmaster at Rugby responsible for the introduction of the sport at the school was previously a teacher at Warminster before joining Rugby.

The Warminster variety of fives also differs greatly in its rules: teams play three-a-side; one on the left, center and right sides of the court (referred to as &quot;squif&quot;, &quot;centre&quot; and &quot;skunk&quot;). The court has dimensions of roughly 8 metres in width and depth.

=== Bat fives ===
Bat fives is a form of fives predating Rugby, Eton, and Westminster forms of the game. It is very similar to the game of rackets, and can even be considered an early form of the game, differing in the shape of the bat used, and the slightly smaller ball used in rackets. The game was played using a willow bat with a curved bowl, measuring around 21 inches by 4 inches, with the end wrapped in leather.

Bat fives was played mostly at Radley and Westminster, but was also played at Rugby, Cheltenham, and Aldenham. It used courts similar in size to squash courts, with an open back, and with no buttress, step or hazards. The sport ceased to be played around 1903, in favour of Eton fives, and most courts were demolished in the 1920s.

When playing, a line was drawn on the ground around 10 feet in front of the front wall. Games were then played to either fifteen or twenty-five points. The 1914 book &quot;Three Hundred Things a Bright Boy Can Do&quot; describes gameplay as:The first player takes the ball, and strikes it against the wall with his bat above the line on the wall, and so that it may fall outside of the line on the ground. The other then strikes it, and the players then continue to hit it against the wall, either before it comes to the ground or at the first rebound, until one of them missing it, or driving it out of bounds, or beneath the wall-line, loses or goes out. The ball may fall anywhere within the side boundaries, after once being struck up by the player who is in.

== Courts and equipment ==
Fives is generally played wearing a leather glove, the practice of which dates from the 18th Century – in John Newbery&#x27;s 1744 children&#x27;s book &quot;A Little Pretty Pocket-Book&quot;, two fives players can be seen wearing white gloves on their right hands. The balls used in fives generally weigh around an ounce and a quarter, and vary in material – leather and rubber are most commonly used.

As shown before, court dimensions vary greatly between different versions of Fives; however, modern day court construction is relatively uniform. Two main types of courts exist; traditional ones, and pre-cast courts. Traditional courts are built by bricklaying a form, which is then coated in a cement render, which consists of concrete and sharp sand (alternatively grus), which is then coated in Keene&#x27;s cement plaster. Precast concrete courts are also available, which are more cost-effective, and faster to build (traditional courts take 4–5 months, concrete courts can be erected in weeks) than traditional courts.

==Players==

=== Europe ===
There are some well-established clubs overseas, such as the Zuoz Fives Club in Zürich, Switzerland.

=== Africa ===
Eton fives is the only version of Fives played in the north of Nigeria, and is especially popular in Katsina State, being more popular in Nigeria than in England itself. The sport was introduced in 1928 by former Eton pupil J. S. Hogden, who was teaching in the state of Katsina (in the Provincial Secondary School) and in Birnin Kebbi. The version of the game in Nigeria is played using a tennis ball, as traditional balls &quot;take chunks out of the mud walls of the courts&quot;, and gloves are not used. In Nigeria, fives is popular; the Emir of Katsina, Abdulmumini Kabir Usman plays, and has a court inside the Katsina Royal Palace.

Fives in Nigeria is regulated by the Fives Federation of Nigeria Several inter-state tournaments are run, which include the &quot;Sardauna&quot; cup and &quot;Dan-Iyan Zazzau Super Cup&quot;. The organisation also works to popularise the sport in Southern Nigeria.

The Eton Fives Association has run multiple tours in conjunction with the Nigerian Fives Association to Nigeria to play the sport: one in 1965, and a second in December 1984 (after which the Nigerian Fives Association visited England), and most recently, a second tour by Nigerian players in 2019.

===Oceania===
Fives was played in schools and universities in Australia in the nineteenth century. A court was opened at the Hutchins School in Hobart, Tasmania, in November 1877, The court was described as &quot;the only one, we believe, in the colony&quot;, and its dimensions as: &quot;Length of floor, 21 ft.; height and width of court 14 ft. each. The court will be an open one, with a flagged floor, the walls will be built of brick, and cemented on the inside.&quot;

The erection of a fives court on the Recreation Ground of the University of Melbourne is noted in the Council minutes of Trinity College in 1873, and there were newspaper reports of an &quot;annual tournament in connexion with the University Fives Club&quot; in 1881, when Professor Herbert Strong acted as judge. A double-handed tournament and a single-handed handicap tournament were played there in August 1883.

Fives is played in some secondary schools in New Zealand, for example Nelson College, New Zealand&#x27;s oldest state school.

=== Asia ===
Eton fives is played in Malaysia, being introduced to Malay College Kuala Kangsar by Charles Ernest Bazell, the school&#x27;s Oxfordian fourth headmaster, in 1923. Two Eton fives courts exist, reopened in 2014, after 50 years of disuse. These courts are speculated to have been the first in the country; however, a report by &quot;The Straits Times&quot; from 30 April 1920 references fives courts at the &quot;Padang Polo (polo ground)&quot; in Penang. Eton Fives teams from Malaysia have been entered into tournaments – in March 2015, two teams were sent to the &quot;UK National Eton Fives Schools Championship&quot; at Eton College, reaching the Plate Quarter Finals.

In India, Eton fives is played only at St. Paul&#x27;s School, Darjeeling, where there exist two courts built in 1899 by the brother of one of the school&#x27;s former rectors as a gift to the school. Court also exist in Kodaikanal, as well as at the Laxmi Vilas Palace, but these are not in use.

=== Americas ===
Fives has been played in the United States since the 18th century, first attested to in a by-law in Pittsfield, Massachusetts in 1791, where several forms of ball games were prohibited from being played within eighty yards of the town hall to protect its windows.

The Racquet Club of Philadelphia built a set of Fives Courts in 1900, but these were quickly used for playing squash. Fives courts also existed at the old location of the Racquet and Tennis Club in New York City before it relocated in 1918, as well as at the Chicago Athletic Association. Fives has received little attention in America since the early 20th century; however, American handball players such as Timothy Gonzalez and Mathieu Pelletier have brought attention to fives by playing it.

Like in England, fives was also played in prestigious preparatory schools, most notably Groton School and St. Mark&#x27;s School, Massachusetts. Of these, only Groton still plays, where three Rugby fives courts, built in 1884 by Endicott Peabody, are in use as of 2016. Until 2001, eight courts had existed at St. Mark&#x27;s School, Massachusetts, built by William Greenough Thayer, and an annual competition between the two schools was held until at least the 1980s. In March 1979, a tour of England was made by players from St. Mark&#x27;s School, the first ever by American players. Several other courts exist scattered throughout the country, for example one near Kezar Lake, and another at the Union Boat Club in Boston.

In 2021, Mexico&#x27;s first Eton Fives court was built in Oaxaca by Emilian Ruiz Ayala, a player who learnt the sport at the Lyceum Alpinum Zuoz. Fives also has a history in Brazil, several fives courts were built by the Western and Brazilian Telegraph Company, although these were closed in the late 1920s. Courts also existed at the São Paulo Athletic Club, which were eventually converted into a swimming pool. Finally, a set of fives courts were built at St Paul&#x27;s School in São Paulo in 1934.

Bat fives was played in Uruguay at the Montevideo Cricket Club, where there were two courts.

<doc id="234597" wikidata="Q7378174" url="?curid=234597" title="Rugby fives">
<text>Rugby fives is a handball game, similar to squash, played in an enclosed court. It has similarities with Winchester fives (a form of Wessex fives) and Eton fives. It is played mainly in the United Kingdom.

It is most commonly believed to be derived from Wessex fives, a game played by Thomas Arnold, famous Headmaster of Rugby School, who had played Wessex fives when a boy at Lord Weymouth&#x27;s Grammar, now Warminster School. The open court of Wessex fives, built in 1787, is still in existence and use at Warminster School.

An early mention of the game can be found in the novel &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s School Days&quot; (1857) by Thomas Hughes. The author attended Rugby School during the period when Dr Arnold was Headmaster.

The game is played between two players (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles), the aim being to hit the ball above a &#x27;bar&#x27; across the front wall in such a way that the opposition cannot return it before a second bounce. The ball is slightly larger than a golf ball, leather-coated and hard. Players wear leather padded gloves on both hands, with which they hit the ball.

==How to play==

Either singles or doubles can be played.

===Court===

A standard Rugby fives court is four-walled, with the floor being rectangular in shape. It is 28 feet long by 18 feet wide and the upper limit of the in-court area is 15 feet for the front wall, sloping down the side walls to 4 feet 10 inches at the back wall. Previously, the height of the back wall was higher at 6 feet but was reduced for architectural reasons as it removes the need for a balcony in new facilities thus reducing building costs and improving communication between coaches and players. In addition, a wooden board running across the front wall with an upper height of 2 feet 6 inches marks the lower limit of the in-court area.

The ball is designed to bounce well on the concrete floor. The walls may be stone or brick but covered in a smooth layer of hard-wearing plaster or alternatively they may be of the same construction as modern squash courts being hollow engineered wood filled with sand.

Rugby fives courts tend to be somewhat idiosyncratic and the dimensions stated above are not always adhered to exactly, particularly those built before 1934 when standard dimensions were established.

A ball is available to allow Rugby fives to be played on a squash court. It is a little bouncier and zippier than the usual ball to account for the larger dimensions (4 feet longer and 3 feet wider), the cushioned wooden floor and lower board height, or rather &#x27;tin&#x27; as it is termed.

===Service===
Usually a 50-50 chance scenario is adopted at the start of a match in order to determine who should serve first (e.g. one player puts the ball behind their back and their opponent guesses which hand it&#x27;s in); however, sometimes a ‘roll’ is used to determine the team that serves ‘seconds’ or ‘second hand’, a ‘roll’ requires the ball to be bounced off of the front wall, the team who rolls closest to the back wall serves ‘seconds’. In order to initiate a point, the server must first throw the ball so that it hits the front wall above the bar, then clips the side wall. Once the ball has done this, the server can choose to retake his serve or continue by hitting it so that it hits the side wall followed by the front wall. If, on the hit part of the serve, the ball hits the front wall first then the serve is referred to as a &#x27;blackguard&#x27; (pronounced &#x27;blaggard&#x27;). The receiver has the option to take a blackguard, as long as they say &#x27;yes&#x27; before striking the ball. If three consecutive blackguards are served without being taken then the server is deemed to have lost a rally.

In doubles, only the receiver initially designated to return serve may do so, unless the serve is a blackguard. In this instance, either receiver may choose to say &#x27;yes&#x27; and return the ball.

As the ball may be hit with either hand, right-handed players will typically use their right hand and the front, right-hand corner of the court to serve. Left-handed players will serve with their left hand, using the front, left-hand corner of the court.

===Play===
Following the serve, the receiver and server take alternate turns to strike the ball against the front wall. The ball must be struck prior to it bouncing twice and while it may hit any combination of back and side walls on its way to the front wall, it must not hit the floor or an out-of-court area. Failing to validly hit the ball against the front wall loses the rally, which results in the following:

*In singles, the loser of a rally must serve the next point
*In doubles, if the servers lose the rally then the designated server within that team changes. If the receivers lose the rally then
**if they have lost a previous point since they last served then they must serve the next point
**if they have not lost a previous point since they last served then the designated receiver within that team changes

===Scoring===
Points are scored from receiving the serve in Rugby fives, as well as in Winchester fives. Thus, a point is only scored if the receiver wins the rally.

Games are played either to 11 or 15 (or 7 if players would like a quick and informal game) , normally agreed before the game commences. If the score is tied at 1 less than the originally agreed winning total (i.e. 10-10 or 14-14) then the winning total is increased by 1 (12 and 16, respectively) but no further (unlike in tennis where you have to win by 2 points in a tie-break).

The receiver&#x27;s score is said first, so if the receiver has 10 points, and the server has 5, the score is 10-5. Zero is said as &#x27;love&#x27;.

At the start of a game of doubles, the servers only need to win one rally in order to switch so that they are receiving (for the rest of the game the usual two before switching applies).

==Tournaments==

Open

Ladies

Other

The asterisk indicates that these tournaments have qualification rounds to play in the main knockout. The top 4 players in the singles rankings automatically qualify for singles tournaments, and the similarly the top 4 doubles pairs qualify automatically.

==The Rugby Fives Association (RFA)==

The RFA is the governing body for the sport of Rugby Fives. The association aims to promote the playing and coaching of Fives at schools, universities and senior level, and throughout the community in general. It does this by organising matches and tournaments throughout the season and advising on – and wherever possible supporting financially – the regeneration of facilities and provision of suitable coaching and equipment to further the game&#x27;s development across the country.

The RFA is the source for all of the information within this Wikipedia entry - verification and additional information can be found on the RFA Website: See www.therfa.uk 

==National singles and doubles champions==

The current national singles champion is Dan Tristao (December 2024) and national doubles champions are Ed Kay and Dan Tristao (April 2024).

==History==
A Grade II listed Rugby Fives Court in Retford, Nottinghamshire, was built in memory of Captain William Eyre of the Lancashire Fusiliers who died at Gallipoli, and was a former pupil and teacher at the school. Only about 20 courts (including this one) are listed. The court was recently refurbished as part of the redevelopment of the site. It is classified as a War Memorial.

<doc id="234598" wikidata="Q193098" url="?curid=234598" title="Kuwaiti dinar">
<text>The Kuwaiti dinar (, code: KWD) is the currency of Kuwait. It is sub-divided into 1,000 fulūs.

As of 2023, the Kuwaiti dinar is the currency with the highest value per base unit, with KD 1 equalling US$3.26, ahead of the Bahraini dinar with BD 1 equalling US$2.65 and Omani rial at US$2.60.

==History==

The dinar was introduced in 1961 to replace the Gulf rupee, equal to the Indian rupee. It was initially equivalent to £1 sterling. As the rupee was fixed at 1&quot;s&quot;.6&quot;d&quot;., that resulted in a conversion rate of Rs. to KD 1.

When Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, the Iraqi dinar replaced the Kuwaiti dinar as the currency and large quantities of banknotes were stolen by the invading forces. After liberation, the Kuwaiti dinar was restored as the country&#x27;s currency and a new banknote series was introduced, allowing the previous notes, including those stolen, to be demonetized.

==Coins==
The coins in the following table were introduced in 1961. The design of all coins is similar and has not changed since they were first minted. On the obverse is a boom ship, with year of minting in both Islamic and Common Era in Arabic. The reverse contains the value in Arabic within a central circle with (Arabic for &quot;The Kuwait&quot;) above and KUWAIT in English below.

Unlike many other Middle Eastern currencies, Kuwait has a coin worth 0.02 of its main currency unit rather than 0.025 or 0.25 – though this latter does exist as a banknote (see below).

The 1 fils coin was last minted in 2014.

==Banknotes==
Six series of the Kuwaiti dinar banknote have been printed.

===First series===
The first series was issued following the pronouncement of the Kuwaiti Currency Law in 1960, which established the Kuwaiti Currency Board. This series was in circulation from 1 April 1961 to 1 February 1982 and consisted of denominations of KD , KD , KD 1, KD 5 and KD 10.

===Second series===
After the creation of the Central Bank of Kuwait in 1969 as a replacement to the Kuwaiti Currency Board, new KD , KD  and KD 10 notes were issued from 17 November 1970, followed by the new KD 1 and KD 5 notes of the second series on 20 April 1971. This second series was withdrawn on 1 February 1982.

===Third series===
The third series was issued on 20 February 1980, after the accession to the throne of late Emir Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, in denominations of KD , KD , 1, 5 and KD 10. A KD 20 banknote was introduced later on 9 February 1986. As a result of the state of emergency after the Invasion of Kuwait, this series was ruled invalid with effect from 30 September 1991. Significant quantities of these notes were stolen by Iraqi forces and some had appeared on the international numismatic market. The &quot;Standard Catalog of World Paper Money&quot; (A. Pick, Krause Publications) lists notes with the following serial number prefix denominators as being among those stolen:

===Fourth series===
After the liberation, a fourth series was issued on 24 March 1991 with the aims of replacing the previous withdrawn series as quickly as possible and guaranteeing the country&#x27;s swift economic recovery. This fourth series was legal tender until 16 February 1995. Denominations were KD , KD , KD 1, KD 5, KD 10 and KD 20.

===Fifth series===
The fifth series of Kuwaiti banknotes was in use from 3 April 1994 and included high-tech security measures which have now become standard for banknotes. It was withdrawn on 1 October 2015. Denominations were as in the fourth series.

===Sixth series===
Central Bank of Kuwait brought the sixth series of Kuwaiti banknotes into circulation on 29 June 2014. Some of the notes are coarse so that the blind can identify them by touch.

===Commemorative issues===
In both 1993 and 2001, the Central Bank of Kuwait issued commemorative KD 1 polymer banknotes to celebrate its Liberation from Iraq. The first commemorative note, dated 26 February 1993, was issued to celebrate the second anniversary of its Liberation. The front features the map of the State of Kuwait, the emblem of Kuwait and on the left and right side of the note is the list of nations that assisted in its Liberation, in both English and Arabic. The second commemorative note, dated 26 February 2001, was issued to celebrate the tenth anniversary of its Liberation. One feature from the note is an optically variable device (OVD) patch that shows a fingerprint, a reference to the victims of the invasion and occupation of Kuwait. Even though they were denominated as KD 1, both of the commemorative notes state that they were not legal tender.

From 18 March 1975 to 4 January 2003, the dinar was pegged to a weighted currency basket. From 5 January 2003 until 20 May 2007, the pegging was switched to US$1 = KD 0.29963 with margins of ±3.5%. The central rate translates to approximately KD 1 = US$3.53.

From 16 June 2007, the Kuwaiti dinar was re-pegged to a basket of currencies, and was worth about $3.28 as of December 2016. It is the world&#x27;s highest-valued currency unit.

<doc id="234604" wikidata="Q7553816" url="?curid=234604" title="Soft-skinned vehicle">
<text>In military terminology, a soft-skinned vehicle, also known as a &#x27;B&#x27; vehicle, is a vehicle that is not protected by vehicle armour. Lexicographer Eric Partridge believed the term soft-skinned vehicle first appeared in military parlance in the early 1940s.

Soft-skinned or &#x27;B&#x27; vehicles are often considered wheeled military vehicles such as light utility vehicles and trucks, but they can be any unarmoured wheeled or tracked vehicle that is not primarily designed to be employed for offensive purposes. They can be purpose-designed models specifically built for military service, militarised versions of commercial vehicle models or standard commercial civilian vehicles pressed into military service. In some cases this class of vehicles may be fitted with vehicle armour for crew defence.

Historically in times of war, a number of military units have converted soft-skinned vehicles into armoured fighting vehicles. One of the first units to do so was the British Royal Naval Air Service. During the First World War the Royal Naval Air Service&#x27;s Armoured Car Section converted a number of cars and trucks into armoured cars and armoured lorries by adding vehicle armour and various armaments.

<text>Chilperic II ( 672 – 13 February 721) was King of the Franks from 715 until his death.

He was a son of Childeric II and his half-cousin wife, Bilichild, both of whom were assassinated, along with their eldest son Dagobert, in 675. Still an infant, Chilperic was spirited to a monastery to protect his life from the internecine feuding of his family. There, he was raised as Daniel until the death of Dagobert III in 715, when he was taken from the monastery – at the age of forty-three – and raised on the shield of the Neustrian warriors as king.

It appears he was supposed to be but a tool in the hands of Ragenfrid, mayor of the palace of Neustria, acclaimed in 714 in opposition to Theudoald, Pepin of Heristal&#x27;s designated heir. Chilperic, however, was his own man: both a fighter and a leader, always at the forefront in battle at the head of his troops. In 716, he and Ragenfrid together led an army into Austrasia, then being warred over by Plectrude, on behalf of her grandson Theudoald, and Charles Martel, the son of Pepin of Heristal. The Neustrians allied with another invading force under Radbod, King of the Frisians, and met Charles in battle near Cologne, then held by Plectrude. Chilperic was victorious and Charles fled to the mountains of the Eifel. The king and his mayor then turned to besiege their other rival in the city. Plectrude acknowledged Chilperic as king, gave over the Austrasian treasury, and abandoned her grandson&#x27;s claim to the mayoralty.

At this juncture, events took a turn against Chilperic. As he and Ragenfrid were leading their triumphant soldiers back to Neustria, Charles ambushed them near Malmedy and in the Battle of Amblève, Charles routed them and they fled. Thereafter, Charles Martel remained virtually undefeated and Chilperic&#x27;s strong will was subdued in a series of campaigns waged in Neustrian territory.

In 717, Charles returned to Neustria with an army and confirmed his supremacy with a victory at Vincy, near Cambrai. He chased the fleeing king and mayor to Paris before turning back to deal with Plectrude and Cologne. On succeeding there, Charles Martel immediately proclaimed Chlothar IV king of Austrasia in opposition to Chilperic. In 718, Chilperic, in response, allied with Odo the Great, the Duke of Aquitaine, who had made himself independent during the contests in 715, but he was again defeated by Charles, at Soissons in 718. King Chilperic II fled with his ducal ally Odo to the land south of the Loire and his mayor Ragenfrid fled to Angers. Chlothar IV soon died suspiciously in 718. Duke Odo then handed over Chilperic II to Charles Martel and, in exchange for Charles recognising Chilperic&#x27;s kingship over all the Franks, the king surrendered his political power to Charles, whom he recognized as Mayor over all the kingdoms (718).

In 719, Chilperic II was officially raised on the shield as King of all the Franks, but he survived but a year and his successors were mere &quot;rois fainéants&quot;. He died in Attigny and was buried in Noyon. Chilperic II may have been the father of Childeric III, but this remains uncertain.

<text>Île Perrot () is an island west of the island of Montreal in the Canadian province of Quebec. Part of the Hochelaga Archipelago, the island lies between Lake Saint-Louis and Lac des Deux-Montagnes. The island was granted by the Intendant Talon of New France to its founder François-Marie Perrot then-Governor of Montreal on 28 October 1672.

Nearly 40,000 people live in one of Île Perrot&#x27;s four municipalities:
*Notre-Dame-de-l&#x27;Île-Perrot
*Pincourt
*Terrasse Vaudreuil
*L&#x27;Île-Perrot

It is part of the Vaudreuil-Soulanges Regional County Municipality of the Montérégie region. This is the only off-island suburban area of Montreal to use Montreal&#x27;s own 514 area code, with all others being allocated to 450. The island is connected to Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, on the West Island of Montreal, via the Galipeault Bridge.

Île Perrot holds the only working windmill in Quebec, dating from the time Île-Perrot was a seigneury in the French colony of New France. The windmill and associated miller&#x27;s house were designated a National Historic Site in 1969, and a Historic Monument under provincial heritage legislation in 1977. In the windmill&#x27;s honour, what now constitutes the commercial artery of the island was named boulevard Don-Quichotte.

==Geology and soils==
The island is underlain by Cambrian-age quartzite. Angular blocks of this hard rock are visible on the surface over much of the island. The soil is a stony sandy loam podzol which has developed on acidic, nutrient-poor quartzite till. Over parts of the island, this till is covered with clay which is nutrient-rich and much less stony, but poorly drained and classified as gleysol.

==Vegetation==
Part of the island remains in forest, although housing developments have made significant inroads over recent years. Deciduous trees such as American beech, sugar maple, red maple, northern red oak, white ash, bitternut hickory and American basswood are dominant. The vegetation is more luxuriant than one would expect from the nature of the soils, and includes a great diversity of wildflowers.

<text>Famoxadone is a fungicide to protect agricultural products against various fungal diseases on fruiting vegetables, tomatoes, potatoes, curcurbits, lettuce and grapes. It is used in combination with cymoxanil. Famoxadone is a QI, albeit with a chemistry different from most QIs. (It is an oxazolidine-dione while most are strobilurins.) It is commonly used against &quot;Plasmopara viticola&quot;, &quot;Alternaria solani&quot;, &quot;Phytophthora infestans&quot;, and &quot;Septoria nodorum&quot;.

==Molecular interaction==
Famoxadone is of lesser interaction strength at the Q pocket than some other QIs, for example, azoxystrobin. This is because azoxystrobin and such interact more centrally in the Q pocket than does famoxadone.

==Resistance management==
Although it has a different chemistry, famoxadone shows full cross-resistance with the rest of the main FRAC group 11 that it belongs to, which is almost entirely strobs. It has not shown cross-resistance with the 11A subgroup however. As with all QIs there is a high risk of resistance development and so pesticide stewardship is important.

Populations of &quot;P. infestans&quot; and &quot;A. solani&quot; in northern and western Europe are not known to be resistant to famoxadone.

==Great Britain approval withdrawn==
On June 30 2024, approval for famoxadone&#x27;s use in Great Britain was withdrawn by the Health and Safety Executive due to the risk it presents to birds. Its use was already banned in the European Union, and there was in 2024 concern about the levels of allowed residue particularly on table grapes being too high.

<text>XM, standing for &quot;extended module&quot;, is an audio file type introduced by Triton&#x27;s FastTracker 2. XM introduced multisampling-capable instruments with volume and panning envelopes, sample looping and basic pattern compression. It also expanded the available effect commands and channels, added 16-bit sample support, and offered an alternative frequency table for portamentos.

XM is a common format for many module files.

The file format has been initially documented by its creator in the file XM.TXT, which accompanied the 2.08 release of FastTracker 2, as well as its latest known beta version: 2.09b. The file, written in 1994 and attributed to Mr.H of Triton (Fredrik Huss), bears the header &quot;The XM module format description for XM files version $0104.&quot; The contents of the file have been posted on this article&#x27;s subpage for reference.

This documentation is however said to be incomplete and insufficient to properly recreate the behaviour of the original program. The MilkyTracker project has expanded the documentation of the XM file format, in an attempt to replicate not only the behaviour of the original software but also its quirks. Their documentation of the XM file format is available on the project&#x27;s GitHub repository.

OXM (oggmod) is a subformat, which compresses the XM samples using Vorbis.

<doc id="234630" wikidata="Q223233" url="?curid=234630" title="Sam Mendes">
<text>Sir Samuel Alexander Mendes (born 1 August 1965) is a British film and stage director, producer, and screenwriter. In 2000, Mendes was appointed a CBE for his services to drama, and he was knighted in the 2020 New Years Honours List. In 2000, Mendes was awarded the Shakespeare Prize by the Alfred Toepfer Foundation in Hamburg, Germany. In 2005, he received a lifetime achievement award from the Directors Guild of Great Britain. In 2008, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; ranked him number 15 in their list of the &quot;100 most powerful people in British culture&quot;.

Born in Berkshire to a Trinidadian Catholic father and an English Jewish mother, Mendes grew up in North London. He read English at Peterhouse at Cambridge University, and began directing plays there before joining Donmar Warehouse, which became a centre of 1990s London theatre culture. In theatre, he is known for his dark re-inventions of the stage musicals &quot;Cabaret&quot; (1993), &quot;Oliver!&quot; (1994), &quot;Company&quot; (1995), and &quot;Gypsy&quot; (2003).

He directed an original West End stage musical for the first time with &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; (2013). For his work on the London stage, Mendes has received three Laurence Olivier Awards for &quot;Company&quot;, &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; and &quot;The Ferryman&quot; and for his work on Broadway he has earned two Tony Awards for Best Direction of a Play for his work on &quot;The Ferryman&quot; in 2019, and &quot;The Lehman Trilogy&quot; in 2022.

In film, he made his directorial debut with the drama &quot;American Beauty&quot; (1999), which earned him the Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Director. He has since directed the films &quot;Road to Perdition&quot; (2002), &quot;Jarhead&quot; (2005), &quot;Revolutionary Road&quot; (2008), and the James Bond films &quot;Skyfall&quot; (2012) and &quot;Spectre&quot; (2015). For the war film &quot;1917&quot; (2019), he received the BAFTA Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Director, as well as his second Academy Award nominations for Best Director, Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay.

Mendes is currently planning a set of four individual but interconnected films based on the lives of each of the members of the Beatles.

== Early life and education ==
Mendes was born on 1 August 1965 in Reading, Berkshire. He is the son of Valerie Mendes (born Barnett), a publisher and author, and Jameson Peter Mendes, a university professor. His father is a Roman Catholic of Portuguese descent from Trinidad and Tobago, and his mother is an English Jew. His grandfather was the Trinidadian writer Alfred Hubert Mendes.

Mendes&#x27;s parents divorced when he was three years old, after which Mendes and his mother settled in Primrose Hill in North London. He attended Primrose Hill Primary School and was in the same class as future Foreign Secretary David Miliband and author Zoë Heller. In 1976, the family relocated to Woodstock near Oxford, where Mendes&#x27;s mother found work as a senior editor at Oxford University Press. Mendes was educated at Magdalen College School where he met future theatre designer Tom Piper, who went on to work with Mendes on a National Theatre revival of Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;The Birthday Party&quot;.

Mendes had an early interest in cinema and applied to the University of Warwick (then the only university in the UK that offered an undergraduate film course), but was turned down. He was then accepted by Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he graduated with first-class honours in English. Having developed a passion for theatre only in his late teens, Mendes became a member of the Marlowe Society at Cambridge and directed several plays. His first play was David Halliwell&#x27;s &quot;Little Malcolm and His Struggle Against the Eunuchs&quot;, and one of his later productions was &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; with Tom Hollander and Jonathan Cake among the cast members. During his time at Cambridge, Mendes also became enthusiastic about cinema in earnest. He cited &quot;Paris, Texas&quot;, &quot;Repo Man&quot; and &quot;True Stories&quot; as three &quot;seminal film moments&quot; that influenced his stage and film career.

Mendes was noted as a &quot;brilliant schoolboy cricketer&quot; by &quot;Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack&quot;, scoring 1,153 runs at 46 and taking 83 wickets at under 16 for Magdalen College School in 1983 and 1984. He also played cricket for Cambridge University Cricket Club, and in 1997 played for Shipton-under-Wychwood in the final of the Village Cricket Cup, the only winner of the Academy Award for Best Director to have played at Lord&#x27;s.

== Career ==
=== Stage career ===

==== Early work ====
After graduating from Cambridge in 1987, Mendes was hired as assistant director at the Chichester Festival Theatre. In September 1987, Mendes made his professional directing debut with a double bill of two Anton Chekhov plays, &quot;The Bear&quot; and &quot;The Proposal&quot;. In 1989, he was appointed the inaugural director of the Minerva Theatre.

In 1989, following the abrupt departure of director Robin Phillips, Mendes took over a production of Dion Boucicault&#x27;s &quot;London Assurance&quot; at Chichester. Later that year, Mendes made his West End debut at the Aldwych with a production of Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot;, starring Judi Dench. &quot;London Assurance&quot; then transferred to the West End following a six-month run at Chichester, opening at the Theatre Royal Haymarket. The successes of the plays established Mendes as a theatre director of national renown.

==== Donmar Warehouse (1990–2002) ====
In 1990, Mendes was appointed artistic director of the Donmar Warehouse, a Covent Garden studio space previously used by the Royal Shakespeare Company. He spent two years overseeing the redesign of the theatre, which formally opened in 1992 with the British premiere of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Assassins&quot;. Mendes&#x27;s tenure at the Donmar saw its transformation into one of the most successful and fashionable playhouses in London.

In 1993, Mendes staged an acclaimed revival of John Kander and Fred Ebb&#x27;s &quot;Cabaret&quot; starring Jane Horrocks as Sally Bowles and Alan Cumming as Emcee. The production was approached with a fresh concept, differing greatly from both the original 1966 production directed by Harold Prince and the famed film version, directed by Bob Fosse. This production opened at the Donmar and received four Olivier Award nominations including Best Musical Revival, before transferring promptly to Broadway where it played for several years at the Kit Kat Club (i.e. the Stephen Sondheim Theater). The Broadway cast included Cumming once again as Emcee, with Natasha Richardson as Sally, Mary Louise Wilson as Fraulein Schneider, John Benjamin Hickey as Cliff, and Ron Rifkin as Herr Schultz. Cumming, Richardson, and Rifkin all won Tony Awards for their performances.

1994 saw Mendes stage a new production of Lionel Bart&#x27;s &quot;Oliver!&quot;, produced by Cameron Mackintosh. Mendes, a longtime fan of the work, worked in close collaboration with Bart and other production team members, William David Brohn, Martin Koch and Anthony Ward, to create a fresh staging of the well-known classic. Bart added new musical material and Mendes updated the book slightly, while the orchestrations were radically rewritten to suit the show&#x27;s cinematic feel. The cast included Jonathan Pryce (after much persuasion) as Fagin, Sally Dexter as Nancy, and Miles Anderson as Bill Sikes. Mendes, Pryce and Dexter received Olivier Award nominations for their work on &quot;Oliver!&quot;.

Mendes also directed productions of David Hare&#x27;s &quot;The Blue Room&quot; in 1998, starring Nicole Kidman; Richard Greenberg&#x27;s &quot;Three Days of Rain&quot; in 1999, with Colin Firth, David Morrissey and Elizabeth McGovern; as well as his farewell duo in 2002, Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; and &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, both headed by Simon Russell Beale, Helen McCrory, Emily Watson and Mark Strong. He stepped down as artistic director of the Donmar in December 2002 and was succeeded by Michael Grandage.

==== After the Donmar (2002–present) ====
In 2003, Mendes directed a revival of the musical &quot;Gypsy&quot;. Originally, he planned to stage this production in London&#x27;s West End with an eventual Broadway transfer, but when negotiations fell through, he brought it to New York. The cast included Bernadette Peters as Rose, Tammy Blanchard as Louise and John Dossett as Herbie.

Mendes also directed the 2013 Olivier Award-nominated stage adaptation of Roald Dahl&#x27;s &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; which ran in London&#x27;s West End until January 2017. It starred Douglas Hodge as Willy Wonka, followed by Alex Jennings and Jonathan Slinger who later took over the role.

In 2014, Mendes directed Simon Russell Beale in &quot;King Lear&quot; by William Shakespeare at the National Theatre, London. Mendes directed Jez Butterworth&#x27;s &quot;The Ferryman&quot; for the Royal Court Theatre in London in 2017, before transferring to the West End later that year and Broadway in 2018, for which he won an Olivier Award and Tony Award for Best Director.

In 2018, Mendes directed &quot;The Lehman Trilogy&quot; by Stefano Massini in an English adaptation by Ben Power for the National Theatre, London starring Simon Russell Beale, Adam Godley and Ben Miles. In 2019 the play played a season at the Park Avenue Armory in New York before returning for another London season in the West End. The play made its Broadway transfer in 2020 briefly but was stalled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The play resumed performances in 2021 and went on to receive eight Tony Award nominations winning five awards including Best Play and Best Director of a Play.

=== Film career ===

==== &quot;American Beauty&quot; to &quot;Away We Go&quot; (1999–2009) ====
In 1999, Mendes made his film directorial debut with &quot;American Beauty&quot;, starring Kevin Spacey. He had been approached by Steven Spielberg, who was impressed by his productions of &quot;Oliver!&quot; and &quot;Cabaret&quot;. The film grossed $356.3 million worldwide. The film won the Golden Globe Award, the BAFTA Award and the Academy Award for Best Picture. Mendes won the Golden Globe Award, Directors Guild of America Award, and the Academy Award for Best Director, becoming the sixth director to earn the Academy Award for his feature film debut.

Mendes&#x27;s second film, in 2002, was &quot;Road to Perdition&quot;, which grossed US$181 million. As of October 2023, the aggregate review score on Rotten Tomatoes is currently 81%; critics praised Paul Newman for his performance. The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Supporting Actor for Newman; it won for Best Cinematography.

In 2003, Mendes established Neal Street Productions, a film, television and theatre production company he would use to finance much of his later work. In 2005, Mendes directed the war film &quot;Jarhead&quot;, in association with his production company Neal Street Productions. The film received mixed reviews, with a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 61%, and a gross revenue of US$96.9 million worldwide. The film focused on the boredom and other psychological challenges of wartime.

In 2008, Mendes directed &quot;Revolutionary Road&quot;, starring his then-wife, Kate Winslet, along with Leonardo DiCaprio and Kathy Bates. In a January 2009 interview, Mendes commented, about directing his wife for the first time, &quot;I would open my eyes in the morning and there Kate would be, going, &#x27;Great! You&#x27;re awake! Now let&#x27;s talk about the second scene.&#x27;&quot; Mendes&#x27;s comedy-drama &quot;Away We Go&quot; opened the 2009 Edinburgh International Film Festival. The film follows a couple (John Krasinski, Maya Rudolph) searching North America for the perfect community in which to settle down and start a family. The film was well received by critics but performed poorly at the box office.

In 2010, Mendes co-produced a critically acclaimed documentary film &quot;Out of the Ashes&quot; that deals with cricket in Afghanistan. On 5 January 2010, news broke that Mendes was employed to direct the 23rd Eon Productions instalment of the James Bond franchise. The film, &quot;Skyfall&quot;, was subsequently released on 26 October 2012, to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the Bond films. Mendes had been employed as a consultant on the film when it was in pre-production, and had remained attached to the project during the financial troubles of MGM. The film was a major critical and commercial success, becoming the 14th film to gross over $1 billion worldwide.

In 2012, Mendes&#x27;s Neal Street Productions produced the first series of the BBC One drama series, &quot;Call the Midwife&quot;, following it with a second season which began transmission in early 2013.

==== &quot;Skyfall&quot;, &quot;Empire of Light&quot;, and The Beatles biopic film series (2013–present) ====
After the success of &quot;Skyfall&quot;, Mendes was asked if he was returning to direct the next Bond film. He responded, &quot;I felt I put everything I possibly could into this film and it was the Bond film I wanted to make. And if I felt I could do the same again, then absolutely I would consider doing another one. But it is a big task and I wouldn&#x27;t do it unless I knew I could.&quot; It was reported that one reason Mendes was reluctant to commit was that one proposal involved making two films back-to-back, based on an idea by &quot;Skyfall&quot; writer John Logan, which would have resulted in Mendes and other creative personnel being tied up with filming for around four years. It was reported in February 2013 that this idea had since been shelved and that the next two films would be stand-alone. Mendes said in an interview with film magazine &quot;Empire&quot; in March 2013 that &quot;it has been a very difficult decision not to accept Michael and Barbara&#x27;s very generous offer to direct the next Bond movie.&quot; He cited, amongst other reasons, his commitments to the stage version of &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; and &quot;King Lear&quot;.

However, on 29 May 2013, it was reported that Mendes was back in negotiations with producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli to direct the next Bond film, going back on his previous comments. Wilson and Broccoli were willing to postpone production of the film to ensure Mendes&#x27;s participation. On 11 July 2013, it was announced that Mendes would direct the 24th James Bond film, &quot;Spectre&quot;; it was released in October 2015. This made him the first filmmaker since John Glen to direct two Bond films consecutively. In April 2016, Mendes was named as the president of the jury for the 73rd Venice International Film Festival.

Mendes&#x27;s next film, war epic &quot;1917&quot;, was released by Universal Pictures on 25 December 2019 in the US and on 10 January 2020 in the UK. Based in part on an account told to Mendes by his paternal grandfather, Alfred Mendes, it chronicles the story of two young British soldiers in the spring of 1917 at a critical point during World War I. Mendes went on to win the Golden Globe Award for Best Director for his achievement in directing; in his acceptance speech, he saluted his grandfather, as well as acknowledging the contribution to cinema of fellow nominee Martin Scorsese, who was nominated for &quot;The Irishman&quot;. On 25 January 2020, he won the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Feature Film, following which he was installed by the press as the favourite to win the Academy Award for Best Director at the then approaching 92nd Academy Awards. However that plaudit went instead to Bong Joon-ho for the South Korean film &quot;Parasite&quot;. The two directors had shared the honours for directing at the 25th Critics&#x27; Choice Awards several weeks prior.

In 2022, his next feature was the romantic drama &quot;Empire of Light&quot;, starring Olivia Colman and Micheal Ward.

In February 2024, it was reported that Mendes would produce and direct four separate feature films about each of the members of the Beatles, to be released in 2027. The films will be the first Beatles biopics to have full cooperation from Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, and the families of John Lennon and George Harrison. The films will star Paul Mescal (McCartney), Barry Keoghan (Starr), Joseph Quinn (Harrison), and an actor to be named as Lennon.

==Filmmaking style and techniques==

===Influences===
Mendes has listed Stanley Kubrick, the Coen brothers, Alfred Hitchcock, Martin Scorsese, Wim Wenders, Howard Davies, David Lynch, Peter Brook, Ingmar Bergman, Orson Welles, and Francis Ford Coppola as amongst his cinematic and theatrical influences. He cited &quot;Paris, Texas&quot;, &quot;Repo Man&quot; and &quot;True Stories&quot; as three &quot;seminal film moments&quot; that influenced his stage and film career, and is also heavily influenced by British comedy acts such as Monty Python, The Goons, Tommy Cooper, and Morecambe and Wise.

===Style and themes===
Much of his film directing techniques were informed by his background in theatre, which consisted of meticulous attention to detail, slow pacing, pictorialist composition, close collaborations with actors, use of tranquil atmosphere, periods of wordless visual storytelling, and long takes. Even though he was widely known for his use of long takes in &quot;Spectre&quot; and &quot;1917&quot;, he has used them since &quot;American Beauty&quot;. His first two films established a reputation for him of utilising a visual style that was considered formalist and classical, preferring to shoot and stage scenes with theatrical-style mise-en-scene and use of chiaroscuro. His third film, &quot;Jarhead&quot;, which would mark the first of a long-time collaboration between him and cinematographer Roger Deakins, served as a stylistic departure from the former two films as it relied heavily on a gritter feel with improvised dialogue and looser handheld close-ups. Despite this, it shared a similar attention to detail and flawed characters.
Although he has tackled a variety of genres over the course of his career, Mendes has frequently explored themes of family and isolation in his work. The protagonists in his films are realistically flawed and struggle to fit in a world that is hostile towards them, a theme that was initially established in &quot;American Beauty&quot; and would be further explored in his subsequent films, including &quot;Skyfall&quot; and &quot;Spectre&quot;, and &quot;1917&quot;. The exploration of such themes are owed to his early childhood experiences, particularly with his parents, with the most direct being his grandfather and his mother serving as inspirations for the characters of Schofield and Hilary Small in &quot;1917&quot; and &quot;Empire of Light&quot;, respectively.

In an interview in 2014, Mendes explained his reasoning for exploring such themes: &quot;If you are doing a play or a film, you have to have a secret way in if you are directing it. Sometimes it’s big things. &quot;American Beauty&quot;, for me, was about my adolescence. &quot;Road to Perdition&quot; was about my childhood. &quot;Skyfall&quot; was about middle-age and mortality.&quot;

Mendes has been married to British Classical musician Alison Balsom since 5 January 2017. Their daughter was born in September 2017. Mendes has a son born on 22 December 2003 from his first marriage to actress Kate Winslet and a stepson, born March 2010 from Balsom&#x27;s previous relationship with conductor Edward Gardner. Mendes had a stepdaughter from Winslet&#x27;s first marriage to filmmaker Jim Threapleton.

Mendes was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 2020 New Years Honours List for services to drama.

In 2009, Mendes signed a petition in support of film director Roman Polanski, calling for his release after Polanski was arrested in Switzerland in relation to his 1977 charge for drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl.

Mendes is an opponent of Brexit. In 2017, he stated: &quot;I&#x27;m afraid that the winds that were blowing before the First World War are blowing again. There was this generation of men fighting then for a free and unified Europe, which we would do well to remember.&quot;

<text>Proofreading is a phase in the process of publishing where galley proofs are compared against the original manuscripts or graphic artworks, to identify errors in the typesetting process. In the past, proofreaders would place corrections or proofreading marks along the margins. In modern publishing, material is generally provided in electronic form, traditional typesetting is no longer used and thus (in general) this kind of transcription no longer occurs. 

==Professional==
===Traditional method===

A &quot;galley proof&quot; (familiarly, &quot;a proof&quot;) is a typeset version of copy or a manuscript document. It may contain typographical errors (&quot;printer&#x27;s errors&quot;), as a result of human error during typesetting. Traditionally, a proofreader looks at an portion of text on the copy, compares it to the corresponding typeset portion, and then marks any errors (sometimes called &quot;line edits&quot;) using standard proofreaders&#x27; marks.

Unlike copy editing, the defining procedure of a proofreading service is to work directly with two sets of information at the same time. Proofs are then returned to the typesetter for correction. Correction-cycle proofs will typically have one descriptive term, such as &quot;bounce&quot;, &quot;bump&quot;, or &quot;revise&quot; unique to the department or organization and used for clarity to the strict exclusion of any other.

It is a common practice for &quot;all&quot; such corrections, no matter how slight, to be sent again to a proofreader to be checked and initialled, thus establishing the principle of higher responsibility for proofreaders as compared to their typesetters or artists.

===Alternative methods===
&quot;Copy holding&quot; or &quot;copy reading&quot; employs two readers per proof. The first reads the text aloud literally as it appears, usually at a comparatively fast but uniform rate. The second reader follows along and marks any pertinent differences between what is read and what was typeset. This method is appropriate for large quantities of boilerplate text where it is assumed that there will be comparatively few mistakes.

Experienced copy holders employ various codes and verbal shortcuts that accompany their reading. The spoken word &quot;digits&quot;, for example, means that the numbers about to be read are not words spelled out; and &quot;in a hole&quot; can mean that the upcoming segment of text is within parentheses. &quot;Bang&quot; means an exclamation point. A &quot;thump&quot; or &quot;screamer&quot; made with a finger on the table represents the initial cap, comma, period, or similar obvious attribute being read simultaneously. Thus the line of text &quot;&quot;(He said the address was 1234 Central Blvd., and to hurry!)&quot; would be read aloud as &quot;in a hole&quot; [thump] &quot;he said the address was digits 1 2 3 4&quot; [thump] &quot;central&quot; [thump] &quot;buluhvuhd&quot; [thump] &quot;comma and to hurry bang&quot;&quot;. Mutual understanding is the only guiding principle, so codes evolve as opportunity permits. In the above example, two thumps after &quot;buluhvuhd&quot; might be acceptable to proofreaders familiar with the text.

&quot;Double reading&quot; is when a single proofreader checks a proof in the traditional manner and then another reader repeats the process. Both initial the proof. With both copy holding and double reading, responsibility for a given proof is necessarily shared by the two proofreaders.

&quot;Scanning&quot; is used to check a proof without reading it word for word, has become common with computerization of typesetting and the popularization of word processing. Many publishers have their own proprietary typesetting systems, while their customers use more common commercial programs. Before the original data can be published, it must be converted into a format used by the publisher. The end product is usually called a &quot;conversion&quot;. If a customer has already proofread the contents of a file before submitting it to a publisher, there will be no reason for another proofreader to re-read it from the copy (although this additional service may be requested and paid for). Instead, the publisher is held responsible only for formatting errors, such as typeface, page width, and alignment of columns in tables; and production errors such as text inadvertently deleted. To simplify matters further, a given conversion will usually be assigned a specific template.

===Checklists===
Proofreaders are expected to be consistently accurate by default because they occupy the last stage of typographic production before publication.

Checklists are common in proof-rooms where there is sufficient uniformity of product to distil some or all of its components into a list. They may also act as a training tool for new hires. Checklists are never comprehensive, however: proofreaders still have to find all mistakes that are &quot;not&quot; mentioned or described, thus limiting their usefulness.

==Proofreading and copy-editing==
The term &quot;proofreading&quot; is sometimes incorrectly used to refer to copy editing, and vice versa. Although there is necessarily some overlap, proofreaders typically lack any real editorial or managerial authority, but they may mark queries for typesetters, editors, or authors. To set expectations before hiring proofreaders, some employers post a notice that the job advertised is not a writing or editing position and will not become one. Creativity and critical thinking by their very nature conflict with the strict copy-following discipline that commercial and governmental proofreading requires. Thus, proofreading and editing are fundamentally separate responsibilities. In contrast to proofreaders, copy editors focus on a sentence-by-sentence analysis of the text to &quot;clean it up&quot; by improving grammar, spelling, punctuation, syntax, and structure. The copy editor is usually the last editor an author will work with. Copy editing focuses intensely on style, content, punctuation, grammar, and consistency of usage.

Copy editing and proofreading are parts of the same process; each is necessary at a different stage of the writing process. Copy editing is required during the drafting stage. The copy editors polish the text for precision and conciseness. They attempt to understand the purpose of the writing and the intended audience; therefore, they ask questions such as where the document will be published and who will read it, and they edit accordingly. Proofreading, rather, is required during the last stage of the editing process. Its scope is limited, as the proofreaders focus only on reading the text to ensure the document is error-free and ready for publication. Proofreading generally focuses on correcting any final typos, spelling errors, stylistic inconsistencies (e.g., whether words or numerals are used for numbers), and punctuation errors.

==In fiction==
Examples of proofreaders in fiction include: 
* &quot;The History of the Siege of Lisbon&quot; (&quot;Historia do Cerco de Lisboa&quot;), a 1989 novel by Nobel laureate Jose Saramago
* the short story &quot;Proofs&quot; in George Steiner&#x27;s &quot;Proofs and Three Parables&quot; (1992)
* the short story &quot;Evermore&quot; in &quot;Cross Channel&quot; (1996) by Julian Barnes, in which the protagonist Miss Moss is a proofreader for a dictionary. 
* Under the headline &quot;Orthographical&quot; in James Joyce&#x27;s 1922 novel &quot;Ulysses&quot;, the protagonist Leopold Bloom, watching the typesetter foreman Mr. Nannetti read over a &quot;limp galleypage&quot;, thinks &quot;Proof fever&quot;. 
* Isaac Asimov&#x27;s short story &quot;Galley Slave&quot; features a robot proofreader.

<text>The Minto Cup is awarded annually to the champion junior men&#x27;s box lacrosse team of Canada. The 2023 competition is in Edmonton, Alberta, from August 20–27.

It was donated in 1901 by the Governor General, Lord Minto. Originally restricted to amateurs, within three years the first under-the-table professional teams were already competing for it. After 1904, with efforts to keep the professionals out of competition proving to be futile, it was made open to all challengers.

The last &quot;successful&quot; amateur challenge came in 1908 when New Westminster Salmonbellies won it; the last amateur challenge was made in 1913 by Vancouver Athletic Club. This would be the only time in Canadian lacrosse history when the Mann Cup champions (Vancouver) faced the Minto Cup champions (New Westminster) head-to-head – with the silverware (Minto) going to the winner.

With the professionals essentially in control of the cup by 1910, the newly inaugurated Mann Cup became the replacement for the senior men&#x27;s national amateur championship.

The Minto Cup professional competition was dominated by the New Westminster Salmonbellies, who held the trophy for 21 of the 29 years in which it was contested (the competition was suspended during World War I). 1924 was the last year professionals played for the Minto Cup—after the Coast professional league folded in June 1924, it was then placed into storage and for a time lost and forgotten when the last trustee died. The trophy was located just prior to the 1938 junior competition, underneath a desk in his office. During the trophy&#x27;s period of inactivity, there were suggestions to make the Minto Cup an international championship trophy.

In 1934 the last trustee appointed to supervise the Cup died, and the Lord Minto of the day eventually transferred it to the Canadian Lacrosse Association, which decided to award it as the trophy for the national junior men&#x27;s champion, starting in 1937. Originally, the competition was between all-star provincial teams formed by adding players to the provincial champion. In 1960 this practice was abandoned and the trophy has since been competed for by the Junior A provincial champions of British Columbia of the British Columbia Junior A Lacrosse League, Ontario of the Ontario Junior A Lacrosse League and recently Alberta, of the RMLL the only provinces where organized lacrosse thrives.

<doc id="234645" wikidata="Q941581" url="?curid=234645" title="Port Hills">
<text>The Port Hills () are a range of hills in Canterbury Region of New Zealand, so named because they lie between the city of Christchurch and its port at Lyttelton. They are an eroded remnant of the Lyttelton volcano, which erupted millions of years ago.

The hills start at Godley Head, run approximately east–west along the northern side of Lyttelton Harbour, and continue running to the south, dividing the city from the harbour. The range terminates near Gebbies Pass above the head of the harbour. The range includes a number of summits between 300 and 500 metres above sea level. The range is of significant geological, environmental and scenic importance.

==History==
The volcano is one of two from which Banks Peninsula was originally formed 12 million years ago. The area was first populated by Māori during the 14th century. During early European settlement some 500 years later the Port Hills presented a challenging barrier between the harbour and the planned settlement of Christchurch, their steepness and ruggedness making access extremely difficult. For many years the majority of settlers used the precipitous Bridle Path to transport themselves and their belongings to the plains on the other side. Today the Lyttelton road tunnel and a separate rail tunnel connect the port and the city suburbs, and three road routes crossing the range – via Evans, Dyers and Gebbies passes – are connected by the Summit Road.

In February 2017, bush fires in the Port Hills burned for days, destroying over 2000 Ha of bush and several homes.

==Geography and conservation==

The Port Hills are a prominent feature of the central Canterbury landscape, being visible for many kilometres from the north and west.

The crest of the Port Hills varies somewhat in height, being lowest at the eastern (seaward) end. Two road passes traverse the Port Hills from Christchurch. Dyers Pass (elevation c. 330 m), almost due south of central Christchurch is the more prominent of the two passes. Evans Pass (elevation c. 200 m), which is near the eastern end of the Port Hills, normally connects Sumner and Lyttelton but was closed since the 2011 Christchurch earthquake caused significant damage to Sumner Road on the Lyttelton side of the pass until reopening in 2019.

Between Evans Pass and Dyers Pass are several significant summits, including Sugarloaf (494 m), recognisable by the television transmission tower on its summit; Mount Cavendish (448 m); and Tauhinukorokio / Mount Pleasant (499 m), the highest peak in the northern arc of the Port Hills. West of Dyers Pass, the Port Hills curve away southward and become even higher, rising to 573 m at Coopers Knob. From Coopers Knob the crater rim descends to Gebbies Pass (elevation c. 160 m). The hills south and east of Gebbies Pass are regarded as part of Banks Peninsula proper rather than the Port Hills.

Several suburbs of Christchurch extend onto the northern slopes of the Port Hills, including Cashmere, Mt Pleasant, Heathcote Valley and Sumner. Other parts of the hills are used for farming and forestry, as well as a significant number of scenic reserves created for recreational and conservation purposes, following an initiative by Christchurch councillor Harry Ell at the turn of the 20th century. In 1948 the Summit Road Scenic Society was formed to continue development and maintenance of the reserves.

The hills are an important recreation area for Christchurch residents, with several public parks and reserves, including tracks for mountain biking and walking. A gondola lift to the top of Mount Cavendish was opened in 1992, providing convenient access to the summit and a major tourist attraction for the Canterbury area. The Christchurch Adventure Park was opened in 2016 which provides mountain biking opportunities on the slopes of Worsleys Hill. Road cycling is also very popular on the Port Hills with &quot;short bays&quot; and &quot;long bays&quot; being two of the most popular longer routes.

==Demographics==
The statistical area of Port Hills covers . It had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Port Hills had a population of 72 at the 2018 New Zealand census, a decrease of 18 people (−20.0%) since the 2013 census, and a decrease of 12 people (−14.3%) since the 2006 census. There were 30 households, comprising 39 males and 33 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.18 males per female. The median age was 47.5 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 15 people (20.8%) aged under 15 years, 9 (12.5%) aged 15 to 29, 45 (62.5%) aged 30 to 64, and 6 (8.3%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 95.8% European/Pākehā, 8.3% Asian, and 4.2% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 20.8, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 58.3% had no religion, 20.8% were Christian, 4.2% were Hindu, 4.2% were Buddhist and 8.3% had other religions.

The employment status of those at least 15 was that 30 (52.6%) people were employed full-time, 9 (15.8%) were part-time, and 3 (5.3%) were unemployed.

==Flora and fauna==
Despite the heavy deforestation and clearance of native bush that took place during early settlement, a diverse range of wildlife and plant life populates the Port Hills. Native birds such as the bellbird (&quot;korimako&quot; or &quot;koparara&quot;) fantail, silvereye, grey warbler and shining cuckoo are commonly found in the remaining bush. While the wood pigeon (kererū) often seen in the area is a native to New Zealand others, such as the common blackbird, common chaffinch and song thrush are introduced and very populous species. As well as a great many insect species, gecko and skink are commonly found.

Indigenous plant species such as Banks Peninsula hebe inhabit rock crevices along with rare ferns. The more exposed hillsides are covered with silver tussock and other native grasses, unusually so for an area so close to urban development.

The remaining podocarp forest contains 500- to 600-year-old mataī, tōtara and kahikatea trees as well as fruit and flowering species such as kōwhai, ribbonwood, māhoe, cabbage trees, kānuka and fuchsia.

<text>Slinger Francisco ORTT CM OBE (born 9 July 1935), better known as Mighty Sparrow, is a Trinidadian calypso vocalist, songwriter, and guitarist. Known as the &quot;Calypso King of the World&quot;, he is one of the best-known and most successful calypsonians. He has won Trinidad&#x27;s Carnival Road March competition eight times, Calypso King/Monarch eight times, and has twice won the Calypso King of Kings title.

==Career==

Slinger Francisco was born in the fishing village of Grand Roy, Grenada, West Indies, on 9 July 1935. He moved to Trinidad as a one-year-old with his mother, his father having relocated there in 1937. He grew up in Laventille, a suburb of Port of Spain. He began singing as a small child, but his love of calypso was discouraged while at Newtown Boys Catholic School, where he sang in the choir. At the age of 14, he joined a steel band comprising neighbourhood boys, and performed with the band at Carnival.

He received his performing name &quot;Little Sparrow&quot; during his early career, as a result of his energetic stage performances:
After a couple of years, he changed his stage name to &quot;Mighty Sparrow&quot;. On leaving school, he began working for the government Control Board, but continued to perform calypso, which became the better paid of the two, and his residency at the Lotus Club made him a star locally.

===Calypso King===

His first performance as a carnival singer came in 1954, with &quot;The Parrot and the Monkey&quot;. In 1955, Sparrow made his first recordings – &quot;Missing Baby (Ruby)&quot;, &quot;High Cost of Living&quot; and &quot;Race Track&quot; for Vitadisc – which were included on the &quot;Royalties of Calypso Kingdom&quot; compilation a few years later. In 1955 and 1956, he also recorded &quot;Give The Youngsters A Chance&quot;, &quot;Family Size Coke&quot;, &quot;Goaty&quot;, &quot;Clara Honey Bunch&quot; and &quot;Yankee&#x27;s Back Again&quot; for GEMS, &quot;Jean And Dinah&quot; and &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Canary&quot; for Kay, and &quot;Sailor Man&quot; for Veejay Special Ace.

In 1956, Sparrow won Trinidad&#x27;s Carnival Road March and Calypso King competitions with his most famous song, &quot;Jean and Dinah&quot; (also known as &quot;Yankees Gone&quot;, a song celebrating the departure of US troops from Trinidad). A live performance of &quot;Yankees Gone&quot; was included in the album &quot;Jump Up Carnival in Trinidad&quot;. His prize for winning the Calypso King title was $40. In protest at the small sum (the winner of the Carnival Queen beauty contest won $7,500), he wrote the song &quot;Carnival Boycott&quot; and attempted to organize other singers to boycott the competition. About half of the singers followed, including Lord Melody. Sparrow claims credit for succeeding improvements in the conditions of calypso and steelband musicians in Trinidad, as well as the formation of the Carnival Development Committee, a musicians&#x27; assistance organization. Sparrow refused to officially participate in the competition for the next three years, but he continued to perform unofficially, even winning another Road March title in 1958 with &quot;P.A.Y.E.&quot; He did perform at the 1957 carnival in the Young Brigade Calypso Tent, where the four songs he performed were recorded and later released on the album &quot;Calypso Kings and Pink Gin&quot;.

Sparrow went on to have local hits in 1956 and 1957 with singles such as &quot;Jack Palance&quot;, &quot;No Doctor No&quot;, and &quot;Sailor Man&quot;, before beginning a musical slanging match with Lord Melody, each releasing singles attacking the other. The rivalry went on for several years. In 1957, Sparrow recorded his first album, &quot;Calypso Carnival 58&quot;, released the following year on the Balisier label.

He again boycotted the carnival in 1959, choosing instead to tour extensively, and early that year released the album &quot;Sparrow in Hi Fi&quot; before signing a deal with RCA, for whom he recorded eleven albums between 1960 and 1964.

===Taking calypso abroad===

Calypso music enjoyed a brief period of popularity in other parts in the world during the 1950s. Trinidadian expatriate Lord Kitchener had helped popularize calypso in the United Kingdom, and Sparrow also found some success there. In the United States, interest in calypso was sparked largely by Harry Belafonte&#x27;s 1956 album &quot;Calypso&quot;, the first LP to sell over one million copies. In January 1958, Sparrow, along with longtime rival Lord Melody, travelled to New York City seeking access to the American music audience. Sparrow had already been recording with Balisier and Cook Records, and with Belafonte&#x27;s help he also began to record for RCA Victor. He did not achieve the success he had hoped for; he said in a 2001 interview, &quot;When nothing happened for me, I went back to England and continued on with my career.&quot;

In 1960, Sparrow returned to the Calypso Monarch competition, winning his second Kingship and third Road March title with &quot;Ten to One Is Murder&quot; (an autobiographical song about an incident in which Sparrow allegedly shot a man) and &quot;Mae Mae&quot;. He also began recording for his own label, National Recording. He won the Road March title in 1961 with &quot;Royal Jail&quot; and won his third Calypso King title in 1962 with &quot;Model Nation&quot; and &quot;Sparrow Come Back Home&quot;. He won further titles in the 1960s and 1970s and continued to enjoy great popularity in Trinidad. He recorded prolifically, with forty albums released in the 1960s and 1970s. In the latter half of the 1960s his recordings began to be released in the United Kingdom.

In 1968, he recorded the album &quot;Sparrow Meets the Dragon&quot; with Byron Lee in Jamaica. Their version of &quot;Only a Fool Breaks His Own Heart&quot; (written by Norman Bergen and Shelly Coburn) gave them an international hit in 1969, earning a gold disc upon its re-release in late 1977, igniting a No. 2 hit record in 1978 in the Netherlands.

He had his greatest success internationally in the 1970s, starting with the album &quot;The Best Of&quot;, featuring live recordings in Brooklyn, New York of Sparrow favorites. In 1974, with Van Dyke Parks as producer, he recorded the album &quot;Hot and Sweet&quot; for Warner Bros. in Miami, and the following year reunited with Byron Lee for the &quot;Sparrow Dragon Again&quot; album. He had a big hit in 1977 with &quot;Crawford&quot;, a tribute to sprinter Hasley Crawford, and that year embarked on a tour of West Africa, during which he was given the honorary Yoruba title Chief Omo Wale of Ikoyi. In 1978, he recorded the album &quot;Only a Fool&quot; in London for Trojan Records.

Sparrow recognized the advantages of using New York as a base for recording and international touring, and by the mid-1960s moved his operation and family to Jamaica, Queens. He became a fixture in Brooklyn’s Labor Day Carnival, regularly appearing at the big Dimanche Gras show at the Brooklyn Museum. He wrote a number of calypsos about life in New York, bookended by his 1969 classic &quot;Mas in Brooklyn&quot; and his provocative 1991 &quot;Crown Heights Justice.&quot;

===Soca===

As soca began to supplant calypso in popularity in Trinidad and Tobago during the late 1970s and early 1980s, Sparrow embraced the hybrid of calypso and soul fused with the local chutney music. In 1984 he won his eighth Road March title with the soca-influenced &quot;Doh Back Back&quot;. Also around this time, he began to spend at least half the year in New York City, finding an apartment in the West Indian neighborhoods in Jamaica, Queens. In 1985, he performed at the carnival&#x27;s King of Kings show alongside The Mighty Swallow, Blue Boy, Scrunter, Blakie, Mighty Duke, and Black Stalin, taking the &quot;King of Kings&quot; title and the US$10,000 first prize. He would later win the title for a second time. His last major title came in 1992, with &quot;Both of Them&quot; and &quot;Survival&quot; winning him the Calypso Monarch title. He made an appearance at the Reggae Sunsplash festival in 1993. Although less active since the mid-1990s, Sparrow continued to perform, and tour into the 21st century; in a 2001 interview, he mentioned that he had been singing and performing a &quot;Gospel-lypso&quot; hybrid. In 2008, he released a song supporting Barack Obama&#x27;s presidential campaign, &quot;Barack the Magnificent&quot;. He also did a remake of his &quot;Congo Man&quot; song with fellow Trinidadian Machel Montano on the 2008 &quot;Flame On&quot; album.

In 2010, Sparrow left the stage in a wheelchair after a performance in Trinidad, and later that year was hospitalised after suffering an inguinal hernia while performing in Maryland. He made a full recovery and continued to tour internationally. He has been hospitalised several times with complications of diabetes. In September 2013, he was due to receive a lifetime achievement award from the Trinidad &amp; Tobago consulate in New York, but was admitted to a New York hospital, where he fell into a coma for two weeks before regaining consciousness.

He returned to public performance in January 2014, with a 40-minute set at a bar in Brooklyn, New York. At the end of the year, he was voted &quot;Express Individual of the Year 2014&quot; by the &quot;Trinidad Express&quot;.

In 2020, he released &quot;Live at 85!&quot;, a recording from December 2019 of a show at Joe&#x27;s Pub in New York City.

==Lyrics==
Sparrow&#x27;s lyrics are famous for being witty, ironic, and ribald. He sings flirtatiously of the attractions of Hispanic women in &quot;Margarita&quot;, and of East Indian women in &quot;Marajhin&quot;. He tells some outrageously frank tales of sexuality in &quot;Mae Mae&quot;, &quot;The Lizard&quot; and &quot;Big Bamboo&quot;, and there is humorous commentary on West Indian culture to be found in &quot;Obeah Wedding&quot; and &quot;Witch Doctor&quot;. Robert Christgau called his controversial song &quot;Congo Man&quot; &quot;a wildly perverse piss-take on African roots, interracial revenge, interracial sex, male-female relations, and cannibalism&quot;. The 1965 song was criticized for its attitudes toward women and Africans, and banned from radio airplay until 1989.

Sparrow also frequently comments on social and political issues in his songs. During his early career he was a supporter of Eric Williams and his People&#x27;s National Movement (PNM), which formed in 1955 and led Trinidad and Tobago to independence in 1962; songs such as &quot;Leave The Damn Doctor Alone&quot; and &quot;William the Conqueror&quot; mentioned Williams directly, while others such as &quot;Federation&quot; (blaming Jamaica for the breakup of the short-lived West Indies Federation), &quot;Our Model Nation&quot; (celebrating Trinidadian independence), and &quot;PAYE&quot; (supporting the PNM&#x27;s pay-as-you-earn tax system) echoed PNM positions. Sparrow did express discontent in 1957&#x27;s &quot;No, Doctor, No&quot;, but it was comparatively mild, and aimed at holding PNM politicians to their promises rather than replacing them. Sparrow cleverly combined political criticism with sexual innuendo in his mid-1960s song &quot;BG Plantain&quot;, which decried the ban levied by PM Williams on imported plantain from British Guiana (BG); plantain, a large banana-shaped vegetable, is a staple of West Indian cuisine, and Sparrow praised the BG plantain as larger, sweeter, and superior to the home-grown Trinidadian variety.

One of his most famous hits, &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; (1979), which achieved international acclaim, addressed the tyranny of rulers such as Idi Amin, the Shah of Iran and other leaders of the era.

His tongue-in-cheek humour is best expressed by his 1970 hit &quot;Sparrow Dead&quot;, which addressed the premature rumours of his death, which persist to this day. The lyrics of the song include:

:&quot;I hear he have cancer
:I hear he have yellow fever
:Something in the bladder
:And a double dose of leukemia!&quot;

:Two gossip mongers gossipin&#x27;
:I stand in a corner listenin&#x27;
:Before I could ask who dey talkin&#x27; about
:A newspaper boy started to shout
:&quot;Extra! Read all about it! Paper!&quot;
:&quot;Who killed the Sparrow - nobody know . . . &quot;

:Well big mouth Lillian
:Say de funeral was on television
:She picky head cousin say that the coffin cost twenty thousand
:This is why he sell de company
:To pay de doctor and de burial fee!&quot;

In more recent times, Sparrow continues to incorporate social issues into his music. &quot;Crown Heights Justice&quot; is a plea for peace and understanding in the wake of the 1991 Crown Heights Riot in Sparrow&#x27;s adopted home of New York City. The themes of peace, tolerance, and concern for the poor show up repeatedly in songs such as &quot;Human Rights&quot; (1981), &quot;Capitalism Gone Mad&quot; (1983), and &quot;This Is Madness&quot; (1995).

<text>Neuilly-sur-Seine (; &#x27;Neuilly-on-Seine&#x27;), also known simply as Neuilly, is an urban commune in the Hauts-de-Seine department just west of Paris in France. Immediately adjacent to the city, north of the Bois de Boulogne, the area is composed of mostly select residential neighbourhoods, as well as many corporate headquarters and a handful of foreign embassies. One of the most affluent areas of France, it is the wealthiest and most expensive suburb of Paris.

Together with the 16th and 7th arrondissement of Paris, the town of Neuilly-sur-Seine forms the most affluent residential area in France. , it is the commune with the fourth highest median per capita income (€52,570 per year) in France.

==History==

Originally, Pont de Neuilly was a small hamlet under the jurisdiction of Villiers, a larger settlement mentioned in medieval sources as early as 832 and now absorbed by the commune of Levallois-Perret. It was not until 1222 that the little settlement of Neuilly, established on the banks of the Seine, was mentioned for the first time in a charter of the Abbey of Saint-Denis: the name was recorded in Medieval Latin as &quot;Portus de Lulliaco&quot;, meaning &quot;Port of Lulliacum&quot;. In 1224 another charter of Saint-Denis recorded the name as &quot;Lugniacum&quot;. In a sales contract dated 1266, the name was also recorded as &quot;Luingni&quot;. The proper spelling would have been &quot;Liljakumpu&quot;.

In 1316, however, in a ruling of the &quot;parlement&quot; of Paris, the name was recorded as &quot;Nully&quot;. In a document dated 1376, the name was again recorded as &quot;Nulliacum&quot; (the Medieval Latin version of &quot;Nully&quot;). Then in the following centuries the name recorded alternated between &quot;Luny&quot; and &quot;Nully&quot;, and it is only after 1648 that the name was definitely set as &quot;Nully&quot;.

Various explanations and etymologies have been proposed to explain these discrepancies in the names of Neuilly recorded over the centuries. The original name of Neuilly may have been &quot;Lulliacum&quot; or &quot;Lugniacum&quot;, and that it was only later corrupted into &quot;Nulliacum&quot; / &quot;Nully&quot;. Some interpret &quot;Lulliacum&quot; or &quot;Lugniacum&quot; as meaning &quot;estate of Lullius (or Lunius)&quot;, probably a Gallo-Roman landowner. This interpretation is based on the many placenames of France made up of the names of Gallo-Roman landowners and suffixed with the traditional placename suffix &quot;-acum&quot;.

Other researchers, however, object that it is unlikely that Neuilly owes its name to a Gallo-Roman patronym, because during the Roman occupation of Gaul the area of Neuilly was inside the large Forest of Rouvray, of which the Bois de Boulogne is all that remains today, and was probably not a settlement. These researchers contend that it is only after the fall of the Roman Empire and the Germanic invasions that the area of Neuilly was deforested and settled. Thus, they think that the name &quot;Lulliacum&quot; or &quot;Lugniacum&quot; comes from the ancient Germanic word &quot;lund&quot; meaning &quot;forest&quot;, akin to Old Norse &quot;lundr&quot; meaning &quot;grove&quot;, to which the placename suffix &quot;-acum&quot; was added. The Old Norse word &quot;lundr&quot; has indeed left many placenames across Europe, such as the city of Lund in Sweden, the Forest of the Londe in Normandy, or the many English placenames containing &quot;lound&quot;, &quot;lownde&quot;, or &quot;lund&quot; in their name, or ending in &quot;-land&quot;. This interesting theory, however, fails to explain why the &quot;d&quot; of &quot;lund&quot; is missing in &quot;Lulliacum&quot; or &quot;Lugniacum&quot;.

Concerning the discrepancy in names over the centuries, the most probable explanation is that the original name &quot;Lulliacum&quot; or &quot;Lugniacum&quot; was later corrupted into &quot;Nulliacum&quot; / &quot;Nully&quot; by inversion of the consonants, perhaps under the influence of an old Celtic word meaning &quot;swampy land, boggy land&quot; (as was the land around Neuilly-sur-Seine in ancient times) which is found in the name of many French places anciently covered with water, such as Noue, Noë, Nouan, Nohant, etc. Or perhaps the consonants were simply inverted under the influence of the many settlements of France called Neuilly (a frequent place name whose etymology is completely different from the special case of Neuilly-sur-Seine).

Until the French Revolution, the settlement was often referred to as &quot;Port-Neuilly&quot;, but at the creation of French communes in 1790 the &quot;Port&quot; was dropped and the newly born commune was named simply Neuilly.

On 1 January 1860, the city of Paris was enlarged by annexing neighbouring communes. On that occasion, a part of the territory of Neuilly-sur-Seine was annexed by the city of Paris, and forms now the neighbourhood of Ternes, in the 17th arrondissement of Paris.

On 11 January 1867, part of the territory of Neuilly-sur-Seine was detached and merged with a part of the territory of Clichy to create the commune of Levallois-Perret.

On 4 June 1878, the Synagogue de Neuilly was founded on Rue Ancelle, the oldest synagogue in the Paris suburbs.

On 2 May 1897, the commune name officially became Neuilly-sur-Seine (meaning &quot;Neuilly upon Seine&quot;), in order to distinguish it from the many communes of France also called Neuilly. Most people, however, continue to refer to Neuilly-sur-Seine as simply &quot;Neuilly&quot;. During the 1900 Summer Olympics, it hosted the basque pelota events.

The American Hospital of Paris was founded in 1906.

In 1919, the Treaty of Neuilly was signed with Bulgaria in Neuilly-sur-Seine to conclude its role in World War I.

In 1929, the Bois de Boulogne, which was previously divided between the communes of Neuilly-sur-Seine and Boulogne-Billancourt, was annexed in its entirety by the city of Paris.

==Politics==

Neuilly is one of the most right-wing towns in France; regularly voting for the candidate of the traditional right in landslide margins. Former president Nicolas Sarkozy was mayor of Neuilly from 1983 to 2007. Amidst a poor national showing of 20%, Neuilly gave right-wing candidate François Fillon 65% of its vote in the first round of the 2017 presidential election.

<text>Schlieren photography is a process for photographing fluid flow. Invented by the German physicist August Toepler in 1864 to study supersonic motion, it is widely used in aeronautical engineering to photograph the flow of air around objects.

The process works by imaging the deflections of light rays that are refracted by a moving fluid, allowing normally unobservable changes in a fluid&#x27;s refractive index to be seen. Because changes to flow rate directly affect the refractive index of a fluid, one can therefore photograph a fluid&#x27;s flow rate (as well as other changes to density, temperature, and pressure) by viewing changes to its refractive index.

Using the schlieren photography process, other unobservable fluid changes can also be seen, such as convection currents, and the standing waves used in acoustic levitation. 

== Classical optical system==
The classical implementation of an optical schlieren system uses light from a single collimated source shining on, or from behind, a target object. Variations in refractive index caused by density gradients in the fluid distort the collimated light beam. This distortion creates a spatial variation in the intensity of the light, which can be visualised directly with a shadowgraph system.

Classical schlieren imaging systems appear in two configurations, using either one or two mirrors. In each case, a transparent object is illuminated with collimated or nearly-collimated light. Rays that are not deflected by the object proceed to their focal point, where they are blocked by a knife edge. Rays that are deflected by the object, have a chance of passing the knife edge without being blocked. As a result, one can place a camera after the knife edge such that the image of the object will exhibit intensity variations due to the deflections of the rays. The result is a set of lighter and darker patches corresponding to positive and negative fluid density gradients in the direction normal to the knife edge. When a knife edge is used, the system is generally referred to as a &quot;schlieren system&quot;, which measures the first derivative of density in the direction of the knife edge. If a knife edge is not used, the system is generally referred to as a &quot;shadowgraph system&quot;, which measures the second derivative of density.

In the two-mirror schlieren system (sometimes called the &quot;Z-configuration&quot;), the source is collimated by the first mirror, the collimated light traverses the object and then is focused by the second mirror. This generally allows higher resolution imaging (seeing finer details in the object) than is possible using the single-mirror configuration.

If the fluid flow is uniform, the image will be steady, but any turbulence will cause scintillation, the shimmering effect that can be seen over heated surfaces on a hot day. To visualise instantaneous density profiles, a short-duration flash (rather than continuous illumination) may be used.

== Focusing schlieren optical system ==
In the mid 20th century, R. A. Burton developed an alternative form of schlieren photography, which is now usually called &quot;focusing schlieren&quot; or &quot;lens-and-grid schlieren&quot;, based on a suggestion by Hubert Schardin. Focusing schlieren systems generally retain the characteristic knife edge to produce contrast, but instead of using collimated light and a single knife edge, they use an illumination pattern of repeated edges with a focusing imaging system.

The basic idea is that the illumination pattern is imaged onto a geometrically congruent cutoff pattern (essentially a multiplicity of knife edges) with focusing optics, while density gradients lying between the illumination pattern and the cutoff pattern are imaged, typically by a camera system. Like in classical schlieren, the distortions produce regions of brightening or darkening corresponding to the position and direction of the distortion, because they redirect rays either away from or onto the opaque part of the cutoff pattern. While in classical schlieren, distortions over the whole beam path are visualized equally, in focusing schlieren, only distortions in the object field of the camera are clearly imaged. Distortions away from the object field become blurred, so this technique allows some degree of depth selection. It also has the advantage that a wide variety of illuminated backgrounds can be used, since collimation is not required. This allows construction of projection-based focusing schlieren systems, which are much easier to build and align than classical schlieren systems. The requirement of collimated light in classical schlieren is often a substantial practical barrier for constructing large systems due to the need for the collimating optic to be the same size as the field of view. Focusing schlieren systems can use compact optics with a large background illumination pattern, which is particularly easy to produce with a projection system. For systems with large demagnification, the illumination pattern needs to be around twice larger than the field of view to allow defocusing of the background pattern.

== Background-oriented techniques ==
Background-oriented schlieren technique (BOS) relies on measuring or visualizing shifts in focused images. In these techniques, the background and the schlieren object (the distortion to be visualized) are both in focus and the distortion is detected because it moves part of the background image relative to its original position. Because of this focus requirement, they tend to be used for large-scale applications where both the schlieren object and the background are distant (typically beyond the hyperfocal distance of the optical system). Since these systems require no additional optics aside from a camera, they are often the simplest to construct but they are usually not as sensitive as other types of schlieren systems, with the sensitivity being limited by the camera resolution. The technique also requires a suitable background image. In some cases, the background may be provided by the experimenter, such as a random speckle pattern or sharp line, but naturally occurring features such as landscapes or bright light sources such as the sun and moon can also be used. Background-oriented schlieren is most often performed using software techniques such as digital image correlation and optical flow analysis to perform synthetic schlieren, but it is possible to achieve the same effect in streak imaging with an analog optical system.

== Variations and applications ==
Variations on the optical schlieren method include the replacement of the knife-edge by a coloured target, resulting in &quot;rainbow schlieren&quot; which can assist in visualising the flow. Different edge configurations such as concentric rings can also give sensitivity to variable gradient directions, and programmable digital edge generation has been demonstrated as well using digital displays and modulators. The adaptive optics pyramid wavefront sensor is a modified form of schlieren (having two perpendicular knife edges formed by the vertices of a refracting square pyramid).

Complete schlieren optical systems can be built from components, or bought as commercially available instruments. Details of theory and operation are given in Settles&#x27; 2001 book. The USSR once produced a number of sophisticated schlieren systems based on the Maksutov telescope principle, many of which still survive in the former Soviet Union and China.

Schlieren photography is used to visualise the flows of the media, which are themselves transparent (hence, their movement cannot be seen directly), but form refractive index gradients, which become visible in schlieren images either as shades of grey or even in colour. Refractive index gradients can be caused either by changes of temperature/pressure of the same fluid or by the variations of the concentration of components in mixtures and solutions. A typical application in gas dynamics is the study of shock waves in ballistics and supersonic or hypersonic vehicles. Flows caused by heating, physical absorption or chemical reactions can be visualised. Thus schlieren photography can be used in many engineering problems such as heat transfer, leak detection, study of boundary layer detachment, and characterization of optics.

<doc id="234654" wikidata="Q1571347" url="?curid=234654" title="Collimated beam">
<text>A collimated beam of light or other electromagnetic radiation has parallel rays, and therefore will spread minimally as it propagates. A laser beam is an archetypical example. A perfectly collimated light beam, with no divergence, would not disperse with distance. However, diffraction prevents the creation of any such beam.

Light can be approximately collimated by a number of processes, for instance by means of a collimator. Perfectly collimated light is sometimes said to be &quot;focused at infinity&quot;. Thus, as the distance from a point source increases, the spherical wavefronts become flatter and closer to plane waves, which are perfectly collimated.

Other forms of electromagnetic radiation can also be collimated. In radiology, X-rays are collimated to reduce the volume of the patient&#x27;s tissue that is irradiated, and to remove stray photons that reduce the quality of the x-ray image (&quot;film fog&quot;). In scintigraphy, a gamma ray collimator is used in front of a detector to allow only photons perpendicular to the surface to be detected.

The term &quot;collimated&quot; may also be applied to particle beams – a collimated particle beam – where typically shielding blocks of high density materials (such as lead, bismuth alloys, etc.) may be used to absorb or block peripheral particles from a desired forward direction, especially a sequence of such absorbing collimators. This method of particle collimation is routinely deployed and is ubiquitous in every particle accelerator complex in the world. An additional method enabling this same forward collimation effect, less well studied, may deploy strategic nuclear polarization (magnetic polarization of nuclei) if the requisite reactions are designed into any given experimental applications.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;collimate&quot; comes from the Latin verb &quot;collimare&quot;, which originated in a misreading of &quot;collineare&quot;, &quot;to direct in a straight line&quot;.

==Sources==
===Lasers===
Laser light from gas or crystal lasers is highly collimated because it is formed in an optical cavity between two parallel mirrors which constrain the light to a path perpendicular to the surfaces of the mirrors. In practice, gas lasers can use concave mirrors, flat mirrors, or a combination of both. The divergence of high-quality laser beams is commonly less than 1 milliradian (3.4 arcmin), and can be much less for large-diameter beams. Laser diodes emit less-collimated light due to their short cavity, and therefore higher collimation requires a collimating lens.

===Synchrotron light===
Synchrotron light is very well collimated. It is produced by bending relativistic electrons (i.e. those moving at relativistic speeds) around a circular track. When the electrons are at relativistic speeds, the resulting radiation is highly collimated, a result which does not occur at lower speeds.

===Distant sources===
The light from stars (other than the Sun) arrives at Earth precisely collimated, because stars are so far away they present no detectable angular size. However, due to refraction and turbulence in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, starlight arrives slightly uncollimated at the ground with an apparent angular diameter of about 0.4 arcseconds. Direct rays of light from the Sun arrive at the Earth uncollimated by one-half degree, this being the angular diameter of the Sun as seen from Earth. During a solar eclipse, the Sun&#x27;s light becomes increasingly collimated as the visible surface shrinks to a thin crescent and ultimately a small point, producing the phenomena of distinct shadows and shadow bands.

===Lenses and mirrors===
A perfect parabolic mirror will bring parallel rays to a focus at a single point. Conversely, a point source at the focus of a parabolic mirror will produce a beam of collimated light creating a collimator. Since the source needs to be small, such an optical system cannot produce much optical power. Spherical mirrors are easier to make than parabolic mirrors and they are often used to produce approximately collimated light. Many types of lenses can also produce collimated light from point-like sources.

==Collimation and decollimation==
&quot;Collimation&quot; refers to all the optical elements in an instrument being on their designed optical axis. It also refers to the process of adjusting an optical instrument so that all its elements are on that designed axis (in line and parallel). The unconditional aligning of binoculars is a 3-axis collimation, meaning both optical axis that provide stereoscopic vision are aligned parallel with the axis of the hinge used to select various interpupillary distance settings. With regards to a telescope, the term refers to the fact that the optical axis of each optical component should be centered and parallel, so that collimated light emerges from the eyepiece. Most amateur reflector telescopes need to be re-collimated every few years to maintain optimum performance. This can be done by simple visual methods such as looking down the optical assembly with no eyepiece to make sure the components are lined up, by using a Cheshire eyepiece, or with the assistance of a simple laser collimator or autocollimator. Collimation can also be tested using a shearing interferometer, which is often used to test laser collimation.

&quot;Decollimation&quot; is any mechanism or process which causes a beam with the minimum possible ray divergence to diverge or converge from parallelism. Decollimation may be deliberate for systems reasons, or may be caused by many factors, such as refractive index inhomogeneities, occlusions, scattering, deflection, diffraction, reflection, and refraction. Decollimation must be accounted for to fully treat many systems such as radio, radar, sonar, and optical communications.

<text>A flower war or flowery war (, ) was a ritual war fought intermittently between the Aztec Triple Alliance and its enemies on and off for many years in the vicinity and the regions around the ancient and vital city of Tenochtitlan, probably ending with the arrival of the Spaniards in 1519. Enemies included the city-states of Tlaxcala, Huejotzingo, and Cholula in the Tlaxcala-Pueblan Valley in central Mexico. In these wars, participants would fight according to a set of conventions.

During the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, Tlaxcala allied with the Spaniards against the Aztecs, being eager to see their longtime flower war enemies overthrown.

==Origins==
Texcocan nobleman Ixtlilxochitl gives the &quot;fullest early statement concerning the origin as well as the initial rationale&quot; of the flower war. From 1450 to 1454, the Aztecs had suffered from crop failure and severe drought; this led to famine and many deaths in the central Mexican highlands. Ixtlilxochitl reports that the flower war began &quot;as a response&quot; to the famine: &quot;the priests ... of Mexico [Tenochtitlan] said that the gods were angry at the empire, and that to placate them it was necessary to sacrifice many men, and that this had to be done regularly.&quot; Thus, Tenochtitlan (the Aztec capital), Texcoco, Tlaxcala, Cholula, and Huejotzingo agreed to engage in flower war for the purpose of obtaining human sacrifices for the gods. However, scholars such as Frederic Hicks disagree with using Ixlilxochitl&#x27;s writings as the origin story of the flower war, due to Ixtlilxochitl not specifically mentioning &quot;flower war&quot; and being the only known source to record these events.

== Practice ==
Flower wars differed from typical wars in a number of important aspects. In typical Aztec warfare, the main objectives were political, religious, and socioeconomic reasons. The flower war was a secondary type of warfare that was practiced by the Aztecs and differed from typical warfare. While engaging in a flower war, competing armies would meet on a &quot;preset date at a preselected place&quot;. These places became sacred sites and were called &quot;cuauhtlalli&quot; or &quot;yaotlalli.&quot; Combatants signaled the start of war by burning a large &quot;pyre of paper and incense&quot; between the armies. Actual battle tactics also differed from typical warfare. In typical warfare, the Aztecs used atlatl darts, stones, and other ranged weapons to weaken enemy forces from afar. However, in flower wars, the Aztecs did not use ranged weapons and instead used weapons such as the macuahuitl that required skill and close proximity to the enemy. The use of these kinds of weapons allowed the Aztecs to display their individual combat ability, which was an important part of the flower war.

Flower wars involved fewer soldiers than typical Aztec wars did. A larger proportion of the soldiers would be drawn from nobility than during a typical war. These characteristics allowed the Aztecs to engage in flower wars during any time of the year. In contrast, the Aztecs could fight larger wars of conquest only from late autumn to early spring, because Aztec citizens were needed for farming purposes during the rest of the year. Additionally, flower wars differed from typical wars in that there were equal numbers of soldiers on each side of the battle; this was also related to the Aztecs wanting to show off their military prowess. They had the ability to participate in small warfare more frequently than others so it was used as practice to prepare their warriors for typical warfare.

Flower wars were generally less lethal than typical wars, but a long-running flower war could become increasingly deadly over time. For example, in a long-running flower war between the Aztecs and the Chalcas, there were few battle deaths at the start. After time had passed, captured commoners started to be killed, but captured nobles were frequently released; sacrifice was not always the fate of captives. However, after further time had passed, captive nobles were killed along with the commoners. This increased the cost of the flower war for both the Aztecs and the Chalcas. The Aztecs considered flower war death to be more noble than dying in a typical war; this can be seen in the word for a flower war death, &quot;xochimiquiztli&quot;, which translates to &quot;flowery death, blissful death, fortunate death&quot;. Further, the Aztecs thought that their own warriors who died in a flower war would be transported to the heaven where Huitzilopochtli (the supreme god of sun, fire, and war) lived.

== Purpose ==
The prominence of Aztec warfare stems from their understanding of mythology. According to Caroline Dodds Pennock, a historian from the University of Sheffield, the Aztecs followed the orders of their god of war, Huitzilopochtli, telling the people of Tenochtitlan that they were able to migrate only through war, making their view of their own culture as well as the rest of the world based on warfare. This aspect of their society was so important that the majority of their music revolved around the flowery metaphors, as well as comparing the warriors to multiple types of prominent birds, holding these warriors, and by proxy these wars, to such high esteem, forever cementing their legacy in Aztec society.

With religion being so important to Aztec society, going as far to shape the politics of their society itself, it makes sense that a large part of these flower wars would be to appease their gods, especially Huitzilopochtli, as he was not only their god of war, but also the patron of the state. By extending this devotion to their gods so that the Aztec could make Tenochtitlan the strong capital that they were promised it to be, they are said to have taken many people to be sacrificed in their name, as the Aztec believed that as part of balancing life in the cosmos, they had to give the Earth blood, similarly to their belief that the gods gave their blood to create humans. The Aztec were also not the only people in the Valley of Mexico known to practice these rituals, losing members of their own society to the ones around them in the same way that the Aztec would take prisoners to be sacrificed, and they even believed that being sacrificed themselves was an honor and a distinguished way to die.

Historians have thought that flower wars were fought for purposes including combat training and capturing humans for religious sacrifice. Historians note evidence of the sacrifice motive: one of Cortez&#x27;s captains, Andres de Tapia, once asked Moctezuma II why the stronger Aztec Empire had not yet conquered the nearby state of Tlaxcala outright. The emperor responded by saying that although they could have if they had wanted to, the Aztecs had not done so because war with Tlaxcala was a convenient way of gathering sacrifices and training their own soldiers. However, scholars such as Frederic Hicks question that the main purpose of the flower war was to gain sacrifices. Tlaxcalan historian Muñoz Camargo noted that the Aztecs would often besiege Tlaxcalan towns and cut off trade, which was uncharacteristic of a typical flower war. For this reason, proponents of Hicks&#x27; idea believe that the Aztecs did want to conquer the Tlaxcalans, but that they simply could not for some reason.

Despite many scholars&#x27; doubts about the sacrifice motive of the flower war, Hicks asserts that Moctezuma II&#x27;s explanations of the flower war (gaining sacrifices and combat training) were logical, given that the Aztecs did place a heavy importance on both sacrifice and martial ability. Fighting in actual warfare was a mandatory part of training for warriors of the noble class, and it was heavily encouraged for warriors of lower classes as well. Given these factors, Hicks suggests that Moctezuma II&#x27;s stated reasons may have been genuine and not just an excuse for military failure.

However, some scholars have suggested that the flower war served purposes beyond gaining sacrifices and combat training. For example, Hassig states that for the Aztecs, &quot;flower wars were an efficient means of continuing a conflict that was too costly to conclude immediately.&quot; As such, a purpose of these wars was to occupy and wear down the enemy&#x27;s fighting force. By requiring an equal number of soldiers on each side, the Aztecs made the battle seem balanced at first; however, the side with fewer overall troops suffered more because the losses comprised a greater percentage of their total forces. Through this, the Aztecs used the flower wars to weaken their opponents. Furthermore, since fewer soldiers took part in flower war as compared to a traditional war, the practice of flower war allowed the Aztecs to hold a potential threat at bay while focusing the bulk of their forces elsewhere.

Another purpose of the flower war, according to Hassig, was to show the superiority of Aztec troops. This was another reason that equal numbers of troops were used. If the Aztecs tried to use numerical superiority, their enemy would resort to the kind of defensive tactics that the Aztecs had trouble fighting against. With equal numbers, the enemy would fight the Aztecs on the open field, where individual soldiers had a greater chance of showing off their martial ability. Finally, according to Hassig, &quot;propaganda was perhaps the most significant purpose of flower wars.&quot; By engaging their opponents in the flower war, the Aztecs were able to continuously showcase their force, which warned other city-states about their power. If the Aztecs made enough of a show of force, it could encourage the allies of the Aztec&#x27;s enemies to change their allegiance.

<text>A gangster is a criminal who is a member of a gang. Most gangs are considered to be part of organized crime. Gangsters are also called mobsters, a term derived from &quot;mob&quot; and the suffix &quot;&quot;. Gangs provide a level of organization and resources that support much larger and more complex criminal transactions than an individual criminal could achieve. Gangsters have been active for many years in countries around the world. Gangsters are the subject of many novels, films, television series, and video games.

==Usage==

In modern usage, the term &quot;gang&quot; is generally used for a criminal organization and the term &quot;gangster&quot; invariably describes a criminal. Much has been written on the subject of gangs, although there is no clear consensus about what constitutes a gang or what situations lead to gang formation and evolution. There is agreement that the members of a gang have a sense of common identity and belonging and this is typically reinforced through shared activities and through visual identifications such as special clothing, tattoos, colors, or rings. Some preconceptions may be false. For example, the common view that illegal drug distribution in the United States is largely controlled by gangs has been questioned.

A gang may be a relatively small group of people who cooperate in criminal acts, as with the Jesse James gang, which ended with the leader&#x27;s death in 1882. However, a gang may also be a larger group with a formal organization that survives the death of its leader. For example, each of the Five Families founded in the early 20th century, outlasted its founders and have survived into the 21st century. Large and well structured gangs such as the Mafia, drug cartels, Triads, Crips, Bloods, or even outlaw motorcycle gangs can undertake complex transactions that would be far beyond the capability of one individual, and can provide services such as dispute arbitration and contract enforcement that parallel those of a legitimate government.

The term &quot;organized crime&quot; is associated with gangs and gangsters, but is not synonymous. A small street gang that engages in sporadic low-level crime would not be seen as &quot;organized&quot;. An organization that coordinates gangs in different countries involved in the international trade in drugs or prostitutes may not be considered a &quot;gang&quot;.

==Regional variants==

===Europe===
There are several organized crime groups in Italy. Notably, the Sicilian Mafia, or &quot;Cosa Nostra&quot; is a criminal syndicate that emerged in the mid-nineteenth century in Sicily, Italy. It is a loose association of criminal groups that share common organizational structure and code of conduct. The origins lie in the upheaval of Sicily&#x27;s transition out of feudalism in 1812 and its later annexation by mainland Italy in 1860. Under feudalism, the nobility owned most of the land and enforced law and order through their private armies. After 1812, the feudal barons steadily sold off or rented their lands to private citizens. Primogeniture was abolished, land could no longer be seized to settle debts, and one fifth of the land was to become private property of the peasants. Other similarly large and powerful Italian criminal organizations, often composed of smaller gangs or &quot;clans&quot; generally operating under a shared criminal subculture or code, include the Camorra in Naples and Campania and the Ndrangheta in Calabria.

Organized crime has existed in Russia since the days of Imperial Russia in the form of banditry and thievery. Joseph Stalin, who emerged as the absolute dictator of the Soviet Union had previously founded the Outfit, a criminal gang that were involved with armed robberies, racketeering, assassinations, arms procurement and child couriering.

In the period of Soviet Union, &quot;Vory v Zakone&quot; emerged, a class of criminals that had to abide by certain rules in the prison system. One such rule was that cooperation with the authorities of any kind was forbidden. During World War II some prisoners made a deal with the government to join the armed forces in return for a reduced sentence, but upon their return to prison they were attacked and killed by inmates who remained loyal to the rules of the thieves. In 1988, the Soviet Union legalized private enterprise but did not provide regulations to ensure the security of market economy. Crude markets emerged, the most notorious being the Rizhsky market where prostitution rings were run next to the Rizhsky Railway Station in Moscow.

As the Soviet Union headed for collapse many former government workers turned to crime, while others moved overseas. Former KGB agents and veterans of the Afghan and First and Second Chechen Wars, now unemployed but with experience that could prove useful in crime, joined the increasing crime wave. At first, the Vory v Zakone played a key role in arbitrating the gang wars that erupted in the 1990s. By the mid-1990s it was believed that &quot;Don&quot; Semion Mogilevich had become the &quot;boss of all bosses&quot; of most Russian Mafia syndicates in the world, described by the British government as &quot;one of the most dangerous men in the world&quot;. More recently, criminals with stronger ties to big business and the government have displaced the Vory from some of their traditional niches, although the Vory are still strong in gambling and the retail trade.

The Albanian Mafia is active in Albania, the United States, and the European Union (EU) countries, participating in a diverse range of criminal enterprises including drug and arms trafficking. The people of the mountainous country of Albania have always had strong traditions of family and clan loyalty, in some ways similar to that of southern Italy. Ethnic Albanian gangs have grown rapidly since 1992 during the prolonged period of instability in the Balkans after the collapse of Yugoslavia. This coincided with large scale migration throughout Europe and to the United States and Canada. Although based in Albania, the gangs often handle international transactions such as trafficking in economic migrants, drugs and other contraband, and weapons. Other criminal organizations that emerged in the Balkans around this time are popularly called the Serbian Mafia, Bosnian Mafia, Bulgarian Mafia, and so on.

===Asia===
In China, Triads trace their roots to resistance or rebel groups opposed to Manchu rule during the Qing dynasty, which were given the triangle as their emblem. The first record of a triad society, &quot;Heaven and Earth Gathering&quot;, dates to the Lin Shuangwen uprising on Taiwan from 1786 to 1787. The triads evolved into criminal societies. When the Chinese Communist Party came to power in 1949 in mainland China, law enforcement became stricter and tough governmental crackdown on criminal organizations forced the triads to migrate to Hong Kong, then a British colony, and other cities around the world. Triads today are highly organized, with departments responsible for functions such as accounting, recruiting, communications, training and welfare in addition to the operational arms. They engage in a variety of crimes including extortion, money laundering, smuggling, trafficking and prostitution.

Yakuza are members of traditional organized crime syndicates in Japan. They are notorious for their strict codes of conduct and very organized nature. As of 2009 they had an estimated 80,900 members. Most modern yakuza derive from two classifications which emerged in the mid-Edo period: tekiya, those who primarily peddled illicit, stolen or shoddy goods; and bakuto, those who were involved in or participated in gambling.

===United States and Canada===
In the late 1860s, many Chinese people emigrated to the United States, escaping from insecurity and economic hardship at home, at first working on the west coast and later moving east. The new immigrants formed Chinese Benevolent Associations. In some cases these evolved into Tongs, or criminal organizations primarily involved in gambling. Members of Triads who migrated to the United States often joined these tongs. With a new wave of migration in the 1960s, street gangs began to flourish in major cities. The Tongs recruited these gangs to protect their extortion, gambling and narcotics operations.

As American society and culture developed, new immigrants were relocating to the United States. The first major gangs in 19th century New York City were the Irish gangs such as the Whyos and the Dead Rabbits. These were followed by the Italian Five Points Gang and later a Jewish gang known as the Eastman Gang. There were also &quot;Nativist&quot; anti-immigration gangs such as the Bowery Boys. The Italian-American Mafia arose from offshoots of the Mafia that emerged in the United States during the late 19th century, following waves of emigration from Sicily. There were similar offshoots in Canada among Italian Canadians, such as the Rizzuto crime family.
The terms &quot;gangster&quot; and &quot;mobster&quot; are mostly used in the United States to refer to members of criminal organizations associated with Prohibition. In 1920, the Eighteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution banned the sale, manufacture, and transportation of alcohol for consumption. Many gangs sold alcohol illegally for profit, and used acute violence to stake turf and protect their interest. Often, police officers and politicians were paid off or extorted to ensure continued operation. Al Capone was one of these notorious gangsters during the Depression era for the Chicago Outfit. Capone would rise to control a major portion of illicit activity such as gambling, prostitution, and bootlegging in Chicago during the early 20th century.

In New York City, by the end of the 1920s, two factions of organized crime had emerged to fight for control of the criminal underworld, one led by Joe Masseria and the other by Salvatore Maranzano. This caused the Castellammarese War, which led to Masseria&#x27;s murder in 1931. Maranzano then divided New York City into five families. Maranzano, the first leader of the American Mafia, established the code of conduct for the organization, set up the &quot;family&quot; divisions and structure, and established procedures for resolving disputes. In an unprecedented move, Maranzano set himself up as boss of all bosses and required all families to pay tribute to him. This new role was received negatively, and Maranzano was murdered within six months on the orders of Charles &quot;Lucky&quot; Luciano. Luciano was a former Masseria underling who had switched sides to Maranzano and orchestrated the killing of Masseria. As an alternative to the previous despotic Mafia practice of naming a single Mafia boss as &quot;capo di tutti capi&quot;, or &quot;boss of all bosses,&quot; Luciano created The Commission in 1931, where the bosses of the most powerful families would have equal say and vote on important matters and solve disputes between families. This group ruled over the National Crime Syndicate and brought in an era of peace and prosperity for the American Mafia.

===Latin America===
Most cocaine is grown and processed in South America, particularly in Colombia, Bolivia, Peru, and smuggled into the United States and Europe, the United States being the world&#x27;s largest consumer of cocaine.
Colombia is the world&#x27;s leading producer of cocaine, and also produces heroin that is mostly destined for the US market.
The Medellín Cartel was an organized network of drug suppliers and smugglers originating in the city of Medellín, Colombia. The gang operated in Colombia, Bolivia, Peru, Central America, the United States, as well as Canada and Europe throughout the 1970s and 1980s. It was founded and run by Ochoa Vázquez brothers with Pablo Escobar. By 1993, the Colombian government, helped by the US, had successfully dismantled the cartel by imprisoning or hunting and gunning down its members.

Although Mexican drug cartels, or drug trafficking organizations, have existed for several decades, they have become more powerful since the demise of Colombia&#x27;s Cali and Medellín cartels in the 1990s. Mexican drug cartels now dominate the wholesale illicit drug market in the United States. Sixty five percent of cocaine enters the United States through Mexico, and the vast majority of the rest enters through Florida. Cocaine shipments from South America transported through Mexico or Central America are generally moved over land or by air to staging sites in northern Mexico. The cocaine is then broken down into smaller loads for smuggling across the U.S.–Mexico border. Arrests of key gang leaders, particularly in the Tijuana and Gulf cartels, have led to increasing drug violence as gangs fight for control of the trafficking routes into the United States.

Cocaine traffickers from Colombia, and recently Mexico, have also established a labyrinth of smuggling routes throughout the Caribbean, the Bahama Island chain, and South Florida. They often hire traffickers from Mexico or the Dominican Republic to transport the drug. The traffickers use a variety of smuggling techniques to transfer their drug to U.S. markets. These include airdrops of 500–700 kg in the Bahama Islands or off the coast of Puerto Rico, mid-ocean boat-to-boat transfers of 500–2,000 kg, and the commercial shipment of tonnes of cocaine through the port of Miami. Another route of cocaine traffic goes through Chile, this route is primarily used for cocaine produced in Bolivia since the nearest seaports lie in northern Chile. The arid Bolivia-Chile border is easily crossed by 4x4 vehicles that then head to the seaports of Iquique and Antofagasta.

==In popular culture==
Gangs have long been the subject of movies. In fact, the first feature-length movie ever produced was &quot;The Story of the Kelly Gang&quot; (1906), an Australian production that traced the life of the outlaw Ned Kelly (1855–1880). The United States has profoundly influenced the genre, but other cultures have contributed distinctive and often excellent gangster movies.

===United States===

The stereotypical image and myth of the American gangster is closely associated with organized crime during the Prohibition era of the 1920s and 1930s.

The classic gangster movie ranks with the Western as one of the most successful creations of the American movie industry. The &quot;classic&quot; form of gangster movie, rarely produced in recent years, tells of a gangster working his way up through his enterprise and daring, until his organization collapses while he is at the peak of his powers. Although the ending is presented as a moral outcome, it is usually seen as no more than an accidental failure. The gangster is typically articulate, although at times lonely and depressed, and his worldly wisdom and defiance of social norms has a strong appeal, particularly to adolescents.

The years 1931 and 1932 saw the genre produce three classics: Warner Bros.&#x27; &quot;Little Caesar&quot; and &quot;The Public Enemy&quot;, which made screen icons out of Edward G. Robinson and James Cagney, and Howard Hughes&#x27; &quot;Scarface&quot; starring Paul Muni, which offered a dark psychological analysis of a fictionalized Al Capone. These films chronicle the quick rise, and equally quick downfall, of three young, violent criminals, and represent the genre in its purest form before moral pressure would force it to change and evolve. Though the gangster in each film would face a violent downfall which was designed to remind the viewers of the consequences of crime, audiences were often able to identify with the charismatic anti-hero. Those suffering from the Depression were able to relate to the gangster character who worked hard to earn his place and success in the world, only to have it all taken away from him.

===Latin America===
Latin American gangster movies are known for their gritty realism. &quot;Soy un delincuente&quot; (English: I Am a Criminal) is a 1976 Venezuelan film by director Clemente de la Cerda. The film tells the story of Ramón Antonio Brizuela, a real-life individual, who since childhood has to deal with rampant violence and the drugs, sex and petty thievery of a Caracas slum. Starting with delinquency, Ramón moves on to serious gang activity and robberies. He grows into a tough, self-confident young man who is hardened to violence. His views change when his fiancée&#x27;s brother is killed in a robbery. The film was a blockbuster hit in Venezuela.

&quot;City of God&quot; () is a 2002 Brazilian crime drama film directed by Fernando Meirelles and co-directed by Kátia Lund, released in its home country in 2002 and worldwide in 2003. All the characters existed in reality, and the story is based on real events. It depicts the growth of organized crime in the Cidade de Deus suburb of Rio de Janeiro, between the end of the &#x27;60s and the beginning of the &#x27;80s, with the closure of the film depicting the war between the drug dealer Li&#x27;l Zé and criminal Knockout Ned. The film received four Academy Award nominations in 2004.

===East Asia===
The first yakuza (gangster) film made in Japan was &quot;Bakuto&quot; (Gambler, 1964). The genre soon became popular, and by the 1970s the Japanese film industry was turning out a hundred mostly low-budget yakuza films each year. The films are descendants of the samurai epics, and are closer to Westerns than to Hollywood gangster movies. The hero is typically torn between compassion for the oppressed and his sense of duty to the gang. The plots are generally highly stylized, starting with the protagonist being released from prison and ending in a gory sword fight in which he dies an honorable death.

Although some Hong Kong gangster movies are simply vehicles for violent action, the mainstream movies in the genre deal with Triad societies portrayed as quasi-benign organizations. The movie gangster applies the Taoist principles of balance and honor to his conduct. The plots are often similar to those of Hollywood gangster movies, often ending with the fall of the subject of the movie at the hands of another gangster, but such a fall is far less important than a fall from honor. The first movie made by the acclaimed director Wong Kar-wai was a gangster movie, &quot;As Tears Go By&quot;. In it the protagonist finds himself torn between his desire for a woman and his loyalty to a fellow gangster. &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot; (2002) is a thriller about a police officer who infiltrates a triad and a triad member who infiltrates the police department. The film was remade by Martin Scorsese as &quot;The Departed&quot;.

Gangster films make up one of the most profitable segments of the South Korean film industry. Films made in the 1960s were often influenced by Japanese yakuza films, dealing with internal conflict between members of a gang or external conflict with other gangs. The gangsters&#x27; code of conduct and loyalty are important elements. Starting in the 1970s, strict censorship caused decline in the number and quality of gangster movies, and none were made in the 1980s. In the late 1980s and early 1990s there was a surge of imports of action movies from Hong Kong. The first of the new wave of important home grown gangster movies was Im Kwon-taek&#x27;s &quot;General&#x27;s Son&quot; (1990). Although this movie followed the earlier tradition, it was followed by a series of sophisticated gangster noirs set in contemporary urban locations, such as &quot;A Bittersweet Life&quot; (2005).

<text>Mary Flora Bell (born 26 May 1957) is an English woman who, as a juvenile, killed two preschool-age boys in Scotswood, an inner suburb of Newcastle upon Tyne, in 1968. Bell committed her first killing when she was ten years old. In both instances, Bell informed her victim that he had a sore throat, which she would massage before proceeding to strangle him.

Bell was convicted of manslaughter in relation to both killings in December 1968, in a trial held at Newcastle Assizes when she was 11 years old, and in which her actions were judged to have been committed under diminished responsibility. She is Britain&#x27;s youngest female killer and was diagnosed with a psychopathic personality disorder prior to her trial. Her alleged accomplice in at least one of the killings, 13-year-old Norma Joyce Bell (no relation), was acquitted of all charges.

Bell was released from custody in 1980, at the age of 23. A lifelong court order granted her anonymity, which has since been extended to protect the identity of her daughter and granddaughter. She has since lived under a series of pseudonyms.

==Early life==
Mary Bell&#x27;s mother, Elizabeth &quot;Betty&quot; Bell (née McCrickett), was a well-known local prostitute who was often absent from the family home, frequently travelling to Glasgow to work, and simply leaving her children in the care of their father—if he was present in the household. Mary was her second child, born when Betty was 17 years old. The identity of Mary&#x27;s biological father is debated. For most of her life, Mary believed her father to be William &quot;Billy&quot; Bell, a violent alcoholic and habitual criminal with an arrest record for crimes including armed robbery. However, she was a baby when William Bell married her mother, and it is unknown if he is her actual biological father.

Mary was an unwanted and neglected child. According to her aunt, Isa McCrickett, within minutes of Mary&#x27;s birth, her mother had resented hospital staff attempting to place her daughter in her arms, shouting: &quot;Take the thing away from me!&quot;
As a baby, toddler, and young child, Mary frequently suffered injuries in household accidents while alone with her mother, which led her family to believe that either her mother was deliberately negligent, or intentionally attempting to harm or kill her daughter. On one occasion in about 1960, Betty dropped her daughter from a first-floor window; on another occasion, she plied her daughter with sleeping pills. She is also known to have once sold Mary through an adoption agency to a mentally unstable woman who was unable to have children of her own, resulting in her older sister, Catherine, having to travel alone across Newcastle to reclaim Mary from this individual and return the child to her mother&#x27;s home on Whitehouse Road.

Despite her negligence and abuse of her child, Betty refused repeated offers from her family to take custody of Mary, whom she—as a dominatrix—is alleged to have begun allowing and/or encouraging several of her clients to sexually abuse in sadomasochistic sessions by the mid-1960s. Mary&#x27;s mother actively participated in several of these sessions, including several in which she blindfolded her daughter with a stocking before restraining her hands behind her back and forcing her to perform oral sex upon her clients.

===Temperament===
Both at home and at school, Mary exhibited numerous signs of disturbed and unpredictable behaviour, including sudden mood swings and chronic bed wetting. She is known to have frequently fought with other children—both boys and girls—and to have attempted to strangle or suffocate her classmates or playmates on several occasions. On one occasion, she is known to have attempted to block the trachea of a young girl with sand. This violent behaviour made many children reluctant to socialise with Mary, who would frequently spend her free time with Norma Joyce Bell (1955–1989), the 13-year-old daughter of a next door neighbour, with whom she had become acquainted in early 1967. Although the girls shared the same surname, they were not related.

According to one classmate at Delaval Road Junior School, by 1968, she and her peers had become accustomed to the sudden and marked changes in Mary&#x27;s behaviour, and when she began exhibiting distressful mannerisms—including shaking her head and forming a steely gaze—her peers instinctively knew she was to become violent, with the focus of her stare being the individual she would attack.

===Initial assaults===
On Saturday 11 May 1968, a three-year-old boy was discovered wandering dazed and bleeding in the vicinity of St. Margaret&#x27;s Road, Scotswood. The child later informed police he had been playing with Mary Bell and Norma Bell atop a disused air raid shelter when he had been pushed from the roof to the ground, inflicting a severe laceration to his head. He was unsure of which one of the girls had actually pushed him. The same evening, the parents of three small girls contacted police to complain that both Mary and Norma had attempted to strangle their children as they played in a sandpit.

That evening, both girls were interviewed about these incidents. Both girls denied any culpability for the air raid shelter incident, claiming they had simply discovered the boy, bleeding heavily from a head wound, after he had fallen. Further questioned about the attempted strangulation of the three young girls, Mary denied any knowledge of the incident. However, Norma admitted Mary had tried to &quot;throttle&quot; each of the girls, stating:
Police notified the local authority of the incidents and of Mary&#x27;s violent nature, but due to their age, both girls were simply given a warning. No further action was taken.

==Killings==
===Background===
In the 1960s, Newcastle upon Tyne experienced a significant urban renewal project. Many inner boroughs of the city saw Victorian-era terraced slums demolished in order that modern houses and flats could be constructed, although several families resided in buildings earmarked for demolition as they awaited rehousing by the council.

Local children frequently played in or close to the derelict houses and upon the rubble-strewn expanses of land razed and partially cleared by contractors. One of these locations was a large expanse of waste ground located close to a railway line known to local children as &quot;Tin Lizzie&quot;. The street which ran parallel to this expanse of waste ground was St. Margaret&#x27;s Road.

===Martin Brown===
On 25 May 1968, the day before her 11th birthday, Bell strangled four-year-old Martin Brown in an upstairs bedroom of a derelict house located at 85 St. Margaret&#x27;s Road. She is believed to have committed this crime alone. Brown&#x27;s body was discovered by three children at approximately 3:30 p.m. He was lying on his back with his arms stretched above his head. Aside from specks of blood and foam around his mouth, no signs of violence were visible upon his body. A local workman named John Hall soon arrived on the scene; he attempted to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), to no avail.

As Hall attempted CPR, Mary Bell and Norma Bell appeared at the doorway to the bedroom. Both were quickly shooed out of the house; the two knocked on the door of Martin&#x27;s aunt, Rita Finlay, and informed her: &quot;One of your sisters&#x27; bairns has just had an accident. We think it&#x27;s Martin, but we can&#x27;t tell because there&#x27;s blood all over him.&quot;

The following day, Bernard Knight conducted a post-mortem upon the body of Martin Brown. Knight was unable to find any signs of violence on the child&#x27;s body, and thus was unable to determine the child&#x27;s cause of death, although he was able to discount the investigators&#x27; theory the child had died of poisoning through ingesting tablets. An inquest on 7 June returned an open verdict.
===Intervening incidents===
On Mary&#x27;s 11th birthday, 26 May, she and Norma broke into and vandalised a nursery in nearby Woodland Crescent. The two entered the premises by peeling tiles off the slate roof; they tore books, upturned desks, and smeared ink and poster paints about the property before escaping.

The following day, staff discovered the break-in and vandalism and immediately notified the police, who also discovered four separate notes that claimed responsibility for Martin Brown&#x27;s murder. One of these notes stated: &quot;I murder SO That I may come back&quot;; another read: &quot;WE did murder martain brown fuckof you bastard&quot;; a third note simply read: &quot;Fuch off we murder. Watch out Fanny and Faggot.&quot; The final note was the most complex, reading: &quot;You are mice Y Becurse we murdered Martain Go Brown you Bete Look out THERE are Murders about By Fanny and auld Faggot you Screws.&quot; The police dismissed this incident as a tasteless and childish prank.
Two days later, on 29 May, shortly before the funeral of Martin Brown, in a game of chicken, both girls called upon the house of his mother, June, asking to see her son. When June Brown replied that they could not see her son because he was deceased, Mary replied: &quot;Oh, I know he&#x27;s dead; I want to see him in his coffin.&quot;

===Brian Howe===
On the afternoon of 31 July 1968, a three-year-old named Brian Howe was last seen by his parents in the street outside his house playing with one of his siblings, the family dog, and Mary Bell and Norma Bell. When he did not return home later that afternoon, concerned relatives and neighbours searched the streets without success. At 11:10 p.m., a search party discovered Brian&#x27;s body between two large concrete blocks upon the &quot;Tin Lizzie&quot;.

The first policeman to arrive at the scene observed that a &quot;deliberate but feeble&quot; attempt had been made to conceal the body, which was covered in clumps of grass and weeds. Cyanosis was evident upon the child&#x27;s lips, and several bruises and scratches were evident upon his neck. A pair of broken scissors lay close to his feet.

The coroner would conclude that Brian had died of strangulation, and that he had been deceased for up to seven-and-a-half hours before the discovery of his body. The killer had evidently squeezed Brian&#x27;s nostrils closed with one hand as he or she had gripped his throat with the other. Numerous puncture wounds had been inflicted to the child&#x27;s legs before death, sections of his hair had been cut from his head, his genitals had been partially mutilated, and a crude attempt had been made to carve the initial &quot;M&quot; into his stomach. The relatively small amount of force used to murder the child led the coroner to conclude the killer was another child.

Numerous grey and maroon fibres were discovered upon Brian&#x27;s clothing and shoes. These fibres did not source from any clothing within the Howe household, and had been transferred to the child by his killer(s).

==Investigation==
The discovery of Brian Howe&#x27;s body sparked a large-scale manhunt. Over one hundred detectives from across Northumberland were assigned to the investigation, and more than 1,200 children had been questioned with regard to their whereabouts by 2 August. Two children questioned by detectives on 1 August were Mary Bell and Norma Bell who, witnesses informed investigators, had been seen playing with Brian shortly before he was believed to have died. In her initial interview, Norma seemed excitable, whereas Mary was markedly more observant and taciturn. Although both girls were evasive and contradictory in their initial statements, they freely admitted to having played with Brian on the date of his death, but denied having seen him after lunchtime.

Questioned further the following day, Mary stated she remembered seeing an eight-year-old local boy playing with Brian on the afternoon of 31 July, and that she had also seen him hitting the child. Furthermore, she stated she also remembered that the boy had been covered in grass and weeds as if he had been rolling in a field, and that he had in his possession a small pair of scissors. Mary then expounded: &quot;I saw him trying to cut a cat&#x27;s tail off with the scissors, but there was something wrong with them—one leg was broken or bent.&quot; This self-incriminating statement convinced Detective Chief Inspector (DCI) James Dobson that Mary was the actual killer, as only the police knew about the broken scissors found at the crime scene. In addition, the local boy she named was quickly questioned, and was discovered to have been at Newcastle International Airport on the afternoon of 31 July, with numerous witnesses able to corroborate his parents&#x27; claims.

===First confession===
On the afternoon of 4 August, the parents of Norma Bell contacted police, stating their daughter wished to confess what she knew of the death of Brian Howe. DCI Dobson arrived at their home, formally cautioned Norma, then asked what she knew. Norma then informed Dobson; Mary had taken her to a &quot;spot on the &#x27;Tin Lizzie, at which point she had been shown Brian&#x27;s body. Mary had then demonstrated to her how she had strangled the child. According to Norma, Mary had confessed to her she had enjoyed strangling the child, before describing how she had inflicted the scour marks to his stomach with a razor blade—which had been hidden at the crime scene—and &quot;the broken scissors&quot;. Norma then led police to the crime scene and revealed the location where the razor blade was hidden. A drawing Norma made of the wounds inflicted to the boy&#x27;s abdomen precisely matched those described by the coroner.

Mary Bell was visited at her home in the early hours of 5 August. On this occasion, she was notably defensive when confronted with the discrepancies in her previous statement, informing detectives: &quot;You&#x27;re trying to brainwash me. I will get a solicitor to get me out of this.&quot;

Later the same day, Norma was questioned again. On this occasion, she made a full statement in which she admitted being present when Mary had actually strangled Brian. According to Norma, when the trio were alone on the &quot;Tin Lizzie&quot;, Mary &quot;seemed to go all funny&quot;, pushing the child into the grass and attempting to strangle him before stating to her, &quot;My hands are getting thick. Take over.&quot; She had then run from the scene, leaving Mary alone with Brian.

A forensic examination of clothing owned by both girls revealed the grey fibres discovered upon Brian&#x27;s body were a precise match to a woollen dress owned by Mary; the maroon fibres upon the child&#x27;s shoes were a precise match to a skirt owned by Norma. Furthermore, the same grey fibres had also been found upon the body of Martin Brown.

==Formal charges==
Brian Howe was buried in a local cemetery on 7 August 1968 in a ceremony attended by over 200 people. According to DCI Dobson (who had planned to arrest both girls later that day), Mary Bell stood outside the Howe household as the child&#x27;s coffin was brought from the home at the beginning of the funeral procession. Dobson later stated: &quot;She stood there, laughing. Laughing and rubbing her hands. I thought, &#x27;My God, I&#x27;ve got to bring her in. She&#x27;ll do another one.&#x27;&quot;

Both girls were formally charged with the murder of Brian Howe at 8 p.m. that evening. In response to this charge, Mary replied: &quot;That&#x27;s all right by me.&quot; Norma burst into tears, simply proclaiming: &quot;I never. I&#x27;ll pay you back for this.&quot;

In the presence of an independent witness, Mary prepared a written statement in which she admitted to being present when Brian Howe was murdered, but insisting the murder had been committed by Norma. She also admitted she and Norma had broken into the Woodland Crescent nursery the day after the killing of Martin Brown, defacing the property before the two had written the four handwritten notes.

===Psychological evaluations===
Shortly after their arrest, both girls underwent psychological evaluations. The results of these tests revealed Norma was intellectually delayed and a submissive character who easily displayed emotion, whereas Mary was a bright yet cunning character, prone to sudden mood swings. Occasionally, Mary was willing to talk, although she rapidly became sullen, introspective and defensive in nature.

The four psychiatrists who examined Mary concluded that, although not suffering from a mental disorder, she suffered from a psychopathic personality disorder. In his official report compiled for the Director of Public Prosecutions, David Westbury concluded: &quot;[Mary&#x27;s] social techniques are primitive and take the form of automatic denial, ingratiation, manipulation, complaining, bullying, flight or violence.&quot;

==Trial==
The trial of Mary Bell and Norma Bell for the murders of Martin Brown and Brian Howe began at Newcastle Assizes on 5 December 1968. Both girls were tried before Mr Justice Cusack and a jury, and both pleaded not guilty to the charges. Mary was defended by Harvey Robson QC; Norma by R. P. Smith QC.

Against protests from both defence counsel, on the first day of the trial, the trial judge waived the defendants&#x27; right to anonymity on account of their age. As such, the media were allowed to publicise the names, ages and photographs of both girls, who each sat alongside plainclothed female police officers in the centre of the court, behind their legal representatives, and within arm&#x27;s reach of their families throughout the duration of the trial.

Rudolph Lyons QC opened the case on behalf of the prosecution at 11:30 a.m. In an opening statement lasting six hours, Lyons informed the jury they faced an &quot;unhappy and distressing&quot; task due to the nature of the murders and the ages of the defendants. He then outlined the prosecution&#x27;s intention to illustrate the similarities between both murders, which indicated both boys had been murdered by the same perpetrator or perpetrators. Lyons outlined the circumstances surrounding both deaths and the evidence indicating the defendants&#x27; guilt.

Although Lyons conceded in his opening statement that, despite the defendants&#x27; age difference, Mary was the more dominant of the two, he contended both girls had acted in unison and were equally culpable; killing both children &quot;solely for the pleasure and excitement of murder&quot;, adding: &quot;Both girls well knew that what they did was wrong and what the results would be.&quot;

===Defendants&#x27; testimony===
On the fifth day of the trial, Norma testified in her own defence. She denied any culpability in the actual murder of either child, but admitted under cross-examination to having known Mary&#x27;s penchant for violence and her history of attacking children, and that the two had discussed attacking and killing small children of both sexes. Questioned by Rudolph Lyons as to whether Mary had demonstrated to her how children could be killed, Norma nodded. She then conceded that, as Mary had begun to attack and strangle Brian Howe, she had failed to alert a group of boys playing in the vicinity, stating she had failed to do so as &quot;I did not know what was going to happen in the first place. She had stopped hurting him for a bit when the boys were near the [concrete blocks]&quot;. Questioned as to her own role in the murder, Norma stated she had &quot;never touched&quot; the child.

Following the conclusion of Norma&#x27;s testimony on 12 December, Mary testified in her own defence. Her testimony lasted for almost four hours, concluding on 13 December, and was briefly adjourned on one occasion when she began crying in a policewoman&#x27;s arms. She denied her co-defendant&#x27;s accusations, insisting that although she had observed the body of Martin Brown at St. Margaret&#x27;s Road, she herself had never harmed the child, and that she and Norma had later asked the boy&#x27;s mother to view his body as the two were &quot;daring each other and one of us did not want to be a chicken&quot;. Mary also conceded she had divulged to others her knowledge of Martin&#x27;s death could &quot;get Norma put straight away&quot;.

Questioned with regards to the death of Brian Howe, Mary claimed that Norma had been the individual who had strangled the child as she herself &quot;was just standing and looking. I couldn&#x27;t move. It was as if some glue was pulling us down.&quot; Mary then alleged Norma had encouraged Brian to lie down if he wanted some sweets, telling him: &quot;You&#x27;ve got to lie down for the lady to come with the sweets&quot; before proceeding to strangle him with her bare hands as she herself unsuccessfully attempted to prevent the attack. Mary further stated she could determine the level of force Norma had exhibited because &quot;her fingertips and nails were going white&quot;, and again conceded she had failed to inform authorities of her knowledge of Norma&#x27;s actions out of both fear and a misguided sense of loyalty.

Norma&#x27;s mother, Catherine, then testified that, several months prior to the killing of Brian Howe, she and her husband had discovered Mary attempting to strangle Norma&#x27;s younger sister, Susan, and that she had only released her grip on their daughter&#x27;s throat after her husband had punched Mary in the shoulder. A child psychiatrist named Ian Frazer then testified that Norma&#x27;s mental age was eight years and ten months and that, although her capacity of knowing right from wrong was limited, she was capable of appreciating the criminality of the acts she was accused of committing.

===Closing arguments===
On 13 December, Norma&#x27;s defence counsel, R. P. Smith, delivered his closing argument to the jury. Smith emphasized that although both girls were on trial together, no real evidence existed against his client, and the only evidence against Norma was Mary&#x27;s accusations against her. Smith implored the jurors to &quot;suppress&quot; feelings of outrage and malice, and dispel any idea that &quot;both little girls&quot; pay for the actions of one of them.

Harvey Robson then delivered his closing argument on behalf of Mary. Robson illustrated her broken background and dysfunctional family, and the blur between fantasy and reality in her mind. Robson also referenced the testimony of David Westbury, who had testified on behalf of the defence he had interviewed Mary on several occasions prior to the trial and had formed a &quot;definite view&quot; the child suffered from a serious personality disorder which he classified as a &quot;retarded development of (her) mind&quot;, and that this had been caused by both genetic and environmental factors. This abnormality, Westbury had contended, had impaired Mary&#x27;s actual responsibility for her acts.

Referencing the notes both girls had left in a nursery after the killing of Martin Brown, Robson stated the notes proved the crimes were a &quot;childish fantasy&quot; and, in Mary&#x27;s case, were written to attract attention to herself.

In his closing argument, Rudolph Lyons described the case as a &quot;macabre and grotesque&quot; one, in which Mary—clearly the more domineering of the two despite being the younger girl—wielded a &quot;very compelling influence, reminiscent of the fictional Svengali&quot; over Norma, who, he conceded, was &quot;of subnormal intelligence&quot;, stating: &quot;I forecast to you that the younger girl—although two years and two months younger than the other—was nevertheless the cleverer and more dominating personality.&quot; Outlining the numerous lies Mary had told the police and court alike, Lyons further remarked of Mary&#x27;s lack of remorse, and her high degree of cunning.

==Conviction==
The trial lasted nine days. On 17 December, the jury retired to consider their verdict, and deliberated for three hours and twenty-five minutes before reaching their verdicts. Mary Bell was cleared of murder, but convicted of the manslaughter of both boys on the grounds of diminished responsibility; Norma Bell was acquitted of all charges. Upon hearing the jury&#x27;s verdicts, Norma clapped her hands in excitement, whereas Mary burst into tears as her mother and grandmother also wept.

Passing sentence, Mr Justice Cusack described Bell as a &quot;dangerous&quot; individual, adding she posed a &quot;very grave risk to other children&quot; and that &quot;steps must be taken to protect [the public]&quot; from her. She was sentenced to be detained at Her Majesty&#x27;s pleasure; effectively an indefinite sentence of imprisonment.

At the time of Bell&#x27;s manslaughter convictions, she was aged 11 years and six months, making her Britain&#x27;s youngest female killer, a statistic which remains to the present day.

==Imprisonment==
Bell was initially detained in a Durham remand home before being transferred to a second remand home in South Norwood. She was then transferred to Red Bank Secure Unit, a young offenders institution in Newton-le-Willows, Merseyside, in early 1969, where she was the only female among approximately 24 inmates. Bell would later claim that she was sexually abused by a member of staff and several inmates while incarcerated at this facility, claiming the sexual abuse began when she was aged 13. In November 1973, at age 16, she was transferred to a secure wing of HM Prison Styal in Cheshire. Reportedly, Bell resented her transferral to this facility, and while incarcerated at HM Prison Styal, Bell unsuccessfully applied for parole.

In June 1976, Bell was transferred to Moor Court open prison, where she undertook a secretarial course. Fifteen months later, in September 1977, Bell again made national headlines when she and another inmate, Annette Priest, absconded from this open prison. Both absconders spent several days in the company of two young men in Blackpool, visiting the amusements and sleeping in various local hotels, where Bell used the alias Mary Robinson before the two parted company.

Bell was arrested at the Derbyshire home of one of the men, Clive Shirtcliffe, on 13 September, having by this stage dyed her hair blonde in an effort to disguise her identity. She was returned to custody that evening; Priest was arrested in Leeds days later. Bell&#x27;s penalty for absconding was a loss of prison privileges for 28 days.

==Release==
In June 1979, the Home Office announced their decision to transfer Mary Bell to HM Prison Askham Grange; an open category prison in the village of Askham Richard in efforts to prepare her for her eventual release into society, which was planned for the following year. Beginning in November 1979, Bell worked first as a secretary, then as a waitress at a café in York Minster under supervision guidelines in efforts to prepare her for eventual release.

Bell was released from HM Prison Askham Grange in May 1980 at the age of 23, having served almost eleven and a half years in custody. She was granted anonymity (including a new name), allowing her to start a new life elsewhere in the country under an assumed identity. Upon her release, a spokesman is quoted as saying: &quot;[Bell] wishes to be given a chance to live a normal life and to be left alone.&quot;

Four years after her release from custody, on 25 May 1984, Bell gave birth to a daughter. This would prove to be her only child. Her daughter knew nothing of her mother&#x27;s past until 1998, when reporters discovered Bell&#x27;s then-current location in a resort town on the Sussex Coast, where both had been living for approximately 18 months. This media revelation forced Bell and her 14-year-old daughter to leave their home and be driven to a safe house by undercover officers. Both mother and daughter later relocated to another part of the United Kingdom.

Bell has allegedly returned to Tyneside on several occasions in the years following her release. She is also alleged to have lived in this location for a time.

===Lifelong anonymity===
The right to anonymity granted to Bell&#x27;s daughter following her birth was originally only extended until she had reached the age of 18. However, on 21 May 2003, Bell won a High Court battle to have her own anonymity, and that of her daughter, extended for life. This order was approved by Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, President of the Family Division, and was later updated to include Bell&#x27;s granddaughter (b. January 2009), who was referred to as &quot;Z&quot;. The order also prohibits the divulging of any aspects of their lives which may identify them.

In 1998, Bell collaborated with author Gitta Sereny to provide an account of her life before and after her crimes for Sereny&#x27;s 1998 book &quot;Cries Unheard: The Story of Mary Bell&quot;. Within this book, Bell details the abuse she suffered as a child at the hands of her prostitute mother (whom Bell describes as a dominatrix) and, she alleges, several of her mother&#x27;s clients. Others interviewed are relatives, friends and professionals who knew her before, during and after her imprisonment.

Bell&#x27;s current whereabouts are unknown, and remain protected by the 2003 High Court order. According to Sereny, Bell does not claim she was wrongly convicted and freely admits the abuse she suffered as a child does not excuse her crimes.

<doc id="234658" wikidata="Q3238044" url="?curid=234658" title="Ackermann steering geometry">
<text>The Ackermann steering geometry (also called Ackermann&#x27;s steering trapezium) is a geometric arrangement of linkages in the steering of a car or other vehicle designed to solve the problem of wheels on the inside and outside of a turn needing to trace out circles of different radii.

It was invented by the German carriage builder Georg Lankensperger in Munich in 1816, then patented by his agent in England, Rudolph Ackermann (1764–1834) in 1818 for horse-drawn carriages. Erasmus Darwin may have a prior claim as the inventor dating from 1758. He devised his steering system because he was injured when a carriage tipped over.

== Advantages==
The intention of Ackermann geometry is to avoid the need for tyres to slip sideways when following the path around a curve.
The geometrical solution to this is for all wheels to have their axles arranged as radii of circles with a common centre point. As the rear wheels are fixed, this centre point must be on a line extended from the rear axle. Intersecting the axes of the front wheels on this line as well requires that the inside front wheel be turned, when steering, through a greater angle than the outside wheel.

Rather than the preceding &quot;turntable&quot; steering, where both front wheels turned around a common pivot, each wheel gained its own pivot, close to its own hub. While more complex, this arrangement enhances controllability by avoiding large inputs from road surface variations being applied to the end of a long lever arm, as well as greatly reducing the fore-and-aft travel of the steered wheels. A linkage between these hubs pivots the two wheels together, and by careful arrangement of the linkage dimensions the Ackermann geometry could be approximated. This was achieved by making the linkage not a simple parallelogram, but by making the length of the track rod (the moving link between the hubs) shorter than that of the axle, so that the steering arms of the hubs appeared to &quot;toe out&quot;. As the steering moved, the wheels turned according to Ackermann, with the inner wheel turning further. If the track rod is placed ahead of the axle, it should instead be longer in comparison, thus preserving this same &quot;toe out&quot;.

== Design and choice of geometry ==

A simple approximation to perfect Ackermann steering geometry may be generated by moving the steering pivot points inward so as to lie on a line drawn between the steering kingpins, which is the pivot point, and the centre of the rear axle. The steering pivot points are joined by a rigid bar called the tie rod, which can also be part of the steering mechanism, in the form of a rack and pinion for instance. With perfect Ackermann, at any angle of steering, the centre point of all of the circles traced by all wheels will lie at a common point. 

Modern cars do not use &quot;pure&quot; Ackermann steering, partly because it ignores important dynamic and compliant effects, but the principle is sound for low-speed maneuvers. Some racing cars use reverse Ackermann geometry to compensate for the large difference in slip angle between the inner and outer front tires while cornering at high speed. The use of such geometry helps reduce tire temperatures during high-speed cornering but compromises performance in low-speed maneuvers.

== Extended Ackermann condition ==

The Ackermann condition of vehicle train is fulfilled when both the vehicle wheel and the trailer wheel axes are pointing to the theoretical turning center (momentan centrum).

<text>Vice-Admiral Sir George Carteret, 1st Baronet ( – 14 January 1680 N.S.) was a royalist statesman in Jersey and England, who served in the Clarendon Ministry as Treasurer of the Navy. He was also one of the original lords proprietor of the former British colonies of Carolina and New Jersey. 

Carteret, New Jersey, and Carteret County, North Carolina, both in the United States, are named after him. He acquired the manor of Haynes, Bedfordshire, (&quot;alias&quot; Hawnes) in about 1667.

==Early life==
Carteret was the son of Elias de Carteret and Elizabeth Dumaresq of Jersey, who both died in 1640. Elias was the son of Philippe de Carteret I, 2nd Seigneur of Sark. With the help of his uncle Philippe de Carteret II, 3rd Seigneur of Sark, George was able to gain a position in the Royal Navy (George dropped the &quot;de&quot; from his surname when he entered the English navy, concerned that it sounded too French). 

George Carteret was &quot;bred for the sea&quot; and served as an officer in various naval ships, being commissioned as a Lieutenant of the &quot;Garland&quot; in 1629. In 1631, he served under Vice-Admiral Sir John Penington on the &quot;Bonaventure&quot;.

During this time the young Carteret and Admiral Penington became friends. This friendship would serve Carteret well, as when Penington became the Admiral of the Narrow Seas in 1632, Carteret was given prominent positions throughout the 1630s. He was promoted to Captain in 1635, and commanded the &quot;Mary Rose&quot; and the &quot;Happy Entrance.&quot; Carteret joined a small group of Naval Captains in presenting a memorial of the Navy to King Charles I. According to Samuel Pepys&quot;,&quot; Carteret was responsible for presenting and recommending the first use of frigates in the Royal Navy, from blueprints of a Frenchman in Saint-Malo.

In 1637, Carteret became involved in raids in the Pirate Republic of Salé in order to rescue Christian captives who were held there. In 1641, Carteret was a Vice-Admiral in command of the &quot;Rainbow&quot;. He was given the position of the Comptroller of the Navy in November 1641, for his service to King Charles II. 

As a result of his early life at sea, he received little or no formal education. His ignorance was embarrassing and a source of much ridicule in later life. Andrew Marvell mocked his poor command of English, and Samuel Pepys remarked that his ignorance of even the most basic Latin phrases would cause a schoolboy to be whipped. &quot;Such ignorance is not to be borne in a Privy Councillor&quot;, wrote Pepys severely.

==English Civil War==
Carteret quietly tried to carry on his duties at Comptroller of the Navy during the political fallout that had erupted between the supporters of Charles I and the supporters of Parliament. Many within the rank and file of the Royal Navy supported the Parliamentarian cause and the Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick, a keen parliamentarian, was made the High Lord Admiral of the Royal Navy in 1642 over Carteret&#x27;s former commanding officer, John Penington, who was a royalist.

On the commencement of the Civil War, he retired from the Navy, and withdrew with his family to Jersey, where his uncle, Sir Philippe de Carteret, was the Bailiff and Lieutenant-Governor. The Island descended into conflict in 1643, with George and his uncle fighting on the side of the Royalists. The Royalists managed to hold onto the twin fortresses of Mont Orgueil and Elizabeth Castle and soon were able to rout the Island&#x27;s Parliamentarian supporters. Carteret governed Jersey with great severity, imprisoning Parliamentarian supporters and confiscating their property.

Commissioned vice-admiral and knighted in 1645, Carteret conducted a successful privateering operation against Parliamentarian merchant ships. After the defeat of the Royalists on the mainland in 1645, Carteret afforded an asylum to the Prince of Wales (Charles Stuart) and other refugees of distinction within his government of Jersey, where he served as Bailiff (1643–1651).

Carteret organised the Jersey Militia along parish lines, creating twelve distinct units each with 150 infantrymen under a captain, a lieutenant, as well as a few light guns. Each parish had a small troop of dragoons or mounted infantry. Carteret also had a small private army made up of Royalist veterans, who had fled from England after the defeat of Charles I, and a collection of foreign mercenaries. George Carteret also had Charles II proclaimed King in St. Helier on 17 February 1649 having 23 other prominent people of Jersey including his cousins Sir Philip Carteret and Elias Dumaresq sign the proclamation, after the execution of his father, Charles I.

In 1651, a Parliamentarian expeditionary force was sent to capture the Islands. Colonel James Heane was appointed the military commander of the invasion force which numbered 3,000 men, comprising his own regiment, six companies of Sir Hardress Waller&#x27;s foot, two troops of horse and 200 men from Guernsey. The naval commander was General-at-Sea Robert Blake, whose fleet included twelve warships and a further seventy supply ships and transports. The fleet was sighted at dawn on the 20 October to the north-east of Jersey and remained anchored in St. Ouen&#x27;s Bay all day, waiting for favourable winds in order to start disembarking their troops on the shore.

Upon hearing this news, Sir George Carteret mobilized the Jersey Militia as well as his own professional soldiers. He dispatched the militia of Grouville to defend the town of St. Helier, the militia of St. Lawrence to defend the harbour at St. Aubin, and the militia of St. Brelade to defend the Bay of St. Brelade. Carteret took the bulk of the militia to St. Ouen&#x27;s Bay, which they reached by noon on 20 October. In all, Carteret had about 2,000 men; 300 of which were cavalry, and the rest were infantry, and a score of cannon. With the bulk of the force being conscripts, however, it seems these men had little inclination for a pitched battle against the veterans of the New Model Army.

After several days of the Parliamentarian fleet trying to outmanoeuvre the Royalists (leading many militiamen to desert the Royalist cause), Admiral Blake decided to land his troops in the evening of the 22/23 October. Carteret noticed that some of the ships were heading for the shoreline and he gave the order for his army to prepare for battle. At first, the Royalist cavalry charge was able to thrown the Parliamentarians back into the sea, with the militiamen firing into the ranks of the fleeing invaders.

However, at the crucial moment, the cavalry commander, Colonel Bovill, was struck by a musket bullet and mortally wounded. With this loss, the cavalry fled from the battlefield and, with their retreat, the militiamen soon began to desert despite the efforts of Carteret to rally them. Colonel Heane&#x27;s troops then got themselves organized and disembarked without incident.

Colonel Heane soon began to overrun the Island, with no resistance being offered by the royalists. Carteret&#x27;s sole plan was to hold onto the two castles of Mont Orgueil and Elizabeth Castle, as well as the fort on a small islet off St. Aubin&#x27;s Bay, similar to the royalist strategy in 1643. This did not go according to plan, however, as the garrison of St. Aubin&#x27;s Fort abandoned their posts to the oncoming parliamentarians on 23 October and Mont Orgueil, which was not suited to artillery warfare, surrendered on 25 October.

George Carteret, however, was determined to hold out at Elizabeth Castle, in the hopes that a royalist relief force from France would arrive, or in the hopes of frustrating the parliamentarians so much that they abandoned the siege.

Elizabeth Castle was a far more imposing fortification than the likes of Mont Orgueil or St. Aubin&#x27;s Fort. The castle was built on a rocky islet, which was about a mile off the coast, which meant that it was surrounded by the sea on all sides and made it difficult to be bombarded from the land. It also had an arsenal of fifty-three cannon defending the site, which had ample munitions, and enough provisions for the garrison for about eight months. Nevertheless, Colonel Heane erected a number of batteries as close to Elizabeth Castle as possible and began to bombard the castle. Also within Heane&#x27;s arsenal were three large mortars which fired massive bombs, which were emplaced on a battery near the old harbour of St. Helier.

On the night of 9/10 November, a mortar shell fell onto the roof of the old Abbey Church, which just so happened to be the building where the defenders had been keeping their munitions and gunpowder. The shell exploded on the lowest storey of the priory and detonated the twelve barrels of gunpowder inside, which caused a massive explosion. The blast destroyed several adjacent buildings, which buried forty members of the garrison nearby the blast under rubble. Of these, sixteen men were killed and another ten were wounded.

The blast also destroyed two thirds of food stores and beer and cider rations. A panic ensued amongst the garrison in the aftermath of the explosion, with a number of the defenders deserting their posts and fleeing to St. Helier. These men were quickly captured and interrogated by the parliamentarians, who provided Colonel Heane with valuable information on the state of the castle&#x27;s fortifications. The morale in the remaining garrison quickly declined, especially after an incident in which a Jerseyman of the garrison was hanged for desertion.

Despite these setbacks, George Carteret was determined to hold out for as long as possible, and he proceeded to keep the King&#x27;s Standard flying over Elizabeth Castle for nearly another month. In that time, he received word from Charles II who had stated plainly that the French Government were unwilling to help, for fear of sparking a diplomatic incident with the English Commonwealth. Carteret was, therefore, very much on his own. Negotiations commenced between the two sides on 5 December and, by the 15 December, it was agreed the defending garrison was to march out of the castle with full honours, with officers permitted to retain their swords, breastplates, and pistols. Sir George Carteret was allowed to take a single vessel, sail with all his possessions to France, and formally join the household of the exiled Charles II. On the eve of the surrender, Sir George invited Colonel Heane to dinner and they met each other on the rocks at the foot of Fort Charles (Bastion a part of Elizabeth castle). On 15 December, Sir George sailed to St. Malo on his four gun sloop, &#x27;Scout&#x27;, accompanied by the parliamentarian warship, &#x27;Eagle&#x27;.

He stayed in exile in France for a six years until he was imprisoned in 1657, thence he ventured to Venice. The warmth and kindness with which he received the refugees earned him a permanent place in the King&#x27;s affections, and also the friendship of Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, the King&#x27;s chief adviser during his exile and for the first few years after the Restoration.
==Restoration==
Carteret was sworn into the Privy Council, appointed Vice-Chamberlain of the Household, and constituted Treasurer of the Navy.

His career for the next decade is documented in the diary of Samuel Pepys, who joined him as Clerk of the Acts to the Navy Board in 1660. In 1667, he exchanged his office as Vice-Chamberlain with Lord Anglesey for that of Vice-Treasurer of Ireland, an office which he sold in 1669 for £11,000.

His influence seems to have been at its height in 1665, when he boasted to Pepys that the King did nothing without his knowledge; however, as the naval war dragged on, the Treasurer of the Navy was an obvious target of the opposition, and Pepys noted that by the spring of 1666 Carteret was being attacked on all sides. By the autumn of 1667, he confessed to Pepys that he was longing for the quiet of retirement. As Treasurer he was hard working and free from any suspicion of corruption, although his colleagues at the Navy Board complained that they found his accounts difficult to follow.

From 1661 to 1679, he represented Portsmouth, sponsored by the Admiralty, in the Cavalier Parliament. Although he sat on a number of committees he was a fairly inactive member of the house.

==American colonies==
The fidelity with which Carteret, like John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton, had clung to the royal cause, gave him also great influence at court: he was close to Clarendon, and to the Earl of Sandwich, whose daughter married Carteret&#x27;s eldest son. He had, at an early date, taken a warm interest in the colonization of America. In recognition of all the help given to him during his exile in Jersey in the 1640s, Charles II gave Carteret a large grant of land, part of the previously named New Netherland, which was promptly renamed New Jersey under his charge. With Berkeley, he became one of the proprietors of the Province of Carolina prior to their becoming jointly interested in East Jersey. Carteret County, North Carolina and town of Carteret, New Jersey are named after him, and the city of Elizabeth, New Jersey, is named after his wife, as is Elizabethtown, North Carolina.

In 1665, Carteret was one of the drafters of the &quot;Concession and Agreement&quot;, a document that provided freedom of religion in the colony of New Jersey. It was issued as a proclamation for the structure of the government for the colony written by the two proprietors, Lord Berkeley and Sir George Carteret.

Carteret was a signatory to &quot;The Several Declarations of The Company of Royal Adventurers of England Trading into Africa&quot;, a document published in 1667 which led to the expansion of the Royal Africa Company.

==Later life==
In 1669, he faced expulsion from the House of Commons for misconduct as Vice Chamberlain, being accused of embezzlement. After a statement from the king expressing his satisfaction with Carteret and an acquittal by the House of Lords, the inquiry against him lapsed. He was, in fact, generally regarded as an honest man.

In 1673, he was appointed one of the Lords of the Admiralty, and continued in the public service until his death on 14 January 1680.

Shortly before Carteret&#x27;s death, the king proposed to give him the title Baron Carteret, but Carteret died too soon, so the honour was granted to his grandson George.

==Family==
In the Chapel of Mont Orgueil Castle, May 1640, George Carteret married his cousin Elizabeth de Carteret, daughter of Philippe de Carteret II, 3rd Seigneur de Sark, and his wife Anne Dowse. They had three sons and five daughters:

* Philip (1641–1672), their eldest son, married Lady Jemima Montagu, daughter of the Earl of Sandwich, and had four children: his eldest son George was raised to the peerage. Philip was killed in action at the Battle of Sole Bay, along with his father-in-law; Jemima had died in childbirth in November of the previous year.
* James (died after 1679), served as a captain in the Royal Navy, and married and had children
* George (died 1656), who died unmarried.
* Elizabeth (who never married)
* Rachel
* Louisa-Margaret, who married Sir Robert Atkyns of Sapperton, only son of Sir Robert Atkyns, Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer; her family nickname was &quot;Louisonne&quot;, according to Samuel Pepys
* Anne (died 1668), &quot;a pious and sweet-tempered lady&quot;, who married Sir Nicholas Slanning, 1st Baronet, no issue 
* Caroline, who married Sir Thomas Scott of Scot&#x27;s Hall, son of Edward Scott and Lady Catherine Goring, daughter of George Goring, 1st Earl of Norwich.

Samuel Pepys liked and admired Lady Carteret &quot;the most kind lady in the world.&quot;

==Controversy==

George Carteret is seen as a divisive figure in Jersey, with some seeing him very much as swashbuckling local hero and others as a prolific slave trader who made his fortune through piracy and slavetrading.

Jersey writer, Ollie Taylor, in his blog &#x27;The whitewashing of George Carteret&#x27; says that on the one hand, &#x27;Carteret has also been described as a hero, ‘Jersey’s greatest son’, one of “Jersey’s great figures” and a role model for youngsters.&#x27; But Taylor is also critical of a revisionist history saying, &quot;By ignoring a fundamental part of Carteret’s story it ends up being exactly that, a rewriting of history&#x27;

He explains that, &quot;He [Carteret] was one of the founding six committee members of the ‘Company of Royal Adventurers into Africa’, set up in 1660 to trade in gold, ivory and slaves. Which apparently was also a family affair with his son James ‘collecting’ over 300 slaves from Africa for transportation to the West Indies during one of the company’s early voyages in 1663. The company was succeeded nine years later and was the template for the ‘Royal African Company’, of whom Carteret was a consultant and early minor investor.&quot;

&quot;The Royal African Company went on to ship more African slaves to the Americas than any other institution in the history of the Atlantic slave trade. Between 1680 and 1688, it transported approximately 5,000 slaves a year totalling around 212,000 between 1662 and 1731. It’s estimated that 44,000 men, women and children died en route, with thousands of those who did survive arriving in the New World with the company’s initials branded on their chests.&quot;

In 2014, a Constable of Saint Peter sought and received over £36,000 in public funds to erect a statue of Carteret in Jersey, to commemorate the 350th anniversary of the founding of New Jersey. In June 2020, following the murder of George Floyd and the widespread removal and destruction of monuments of those involved in slave trading around the world, the statue in Saint Peter was defaced with white paint due to Carteret&#x27;s involvement with the Royal Africa Company. One historian called the company &quot;the single most prolific trader of slaves&quot;. After calls from some residents of Jersey to move the statue to a museum were ignored, it was defaced again in August 2020 with red paint and chains.

<doc id="234664" wikidata="Q3181045" url="?curid=234664" title="John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton">
<text>John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton (1602 – 26 August 1678) of Berkeley House in Westminster and of Twickenham Park in Middlesex, was an English royalist soldier, politician and diplomat, of the Bruton branch of the Berkeley family. From 1648 he was closely associated with James, Duke of York (the future King James II), and rose to prominence, fortune, and fame. He and Sir George Carteret were the founders of the Province of New Jersey, a British colony in North America that would eventually become the U.S. state of New Jersey. The territorial designation of his title refers to his role at the Battle of Stratton, Cornwall, in 1643 at which the Royalists destroyed Parliament&#x27;s field army in Devon and Cornwall.

==Origins==
Berkeley was the second son of Sir Maurice Berkeley of Bruton Abbey in the parish of Bruton, Somerset, a member of the landed gentry and a Member of Parliament, by his wife Elizabeth Killigrew, a daughter of Sir William Killigrew of Hanworth. His eldest brother was Charles Berkeley, 2nd Viscount Fitzhardinge; his younger brother, Sir William Berkeley, served as royal governor of the Colony of Virginia from 1642 to 1652 and again from 1660 to 1677. 

==Early life==
John Berkeley was accredited ambassador from Charles I of England to Christina of Sweden, in January 1637, to propose a joint effort by the two sovereigns for the reinstatement of the elector palatine in his dominions; probably the employment of Berkeley in this by his cousin, Sir Thomas Roe, who had conducted negotiations between Gustavus Adolphus and the king of Poland. Berkeley returned from Sweden in July 1637. He had a commission in the army against the Scots in 1638 and was knighted at Berwick in that year. In 1640 he was returned to parliament for both Heytesbury and Reading, electing to retain his seat for the former place. Next year he was accused in parliament of complicity in the Army Plots, expelled from the house, and committed to the Tower of London; he was subsequently bailed by Edward Sackville, 4th Earl of Dorset and Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford in the sum of £10,000, but the outbreak of hostilities prevented any further steps being taken.

==First English Civil War==
Berkeley took a conspicuous part in the First English Civil War, supporting the royal cause. He became governor of Exeter, and general of the royalist forces in Devon.

In 1642 he joined the Marquess of Hertford at Sherborne, and was sent into Cornwall with the rank of commissary-general to act under Sir Ralph Hopton as lieutenant-general. The royalist forces defeated, in May 1643, the Earl of Stamford at the Battle of Stratton, with great loss of baggage and artillery, and pursued him as far as Wells. 

In this affair, Sir John distinguished himself and was now made commander-in-chief of all the royalist forces in Devon. He sat down before Exeter, into which the Earl of Stamford had withdrawn, and which was further defended by the fleet under Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick. Berkeley succeeded in maintaining a blockade, beating off the Earl of Warwick with a loss of three ships, and on 4 September 1643, the Earl of Stamford was compelled to surrender. 

In 1644, Berkeley was present at the baptism of Henrietta Maria, the king&#x27;s daughter, who was born at Exeter. The same year Hopton and Berkeley joined their forces to oppose Sir William Waller&#x27;s westward advance, but were badly beaten at the Battle of Cheriton near Alresford in Hampshire on 29 March. 

In April 1645, he superseded Sir Richard Grenville, being made colonel-general of the counties of Devon and Cornwall, took Wellington House, near Taunton, by assault, and then proceeded to invest Taunton. The advance of Thomas Fairfax westward in the autumn of the year changed the aspect of affairs. In January 1646 Fairfax was able to concentrate on Exeter, which Berkeley was forced (13 April) to surrender, on honourable terms.

==Involvement in the Hampton Court escape==
After the surrender of the royalist forces, Berkeley joined his kinsman, Lord Jermyn, in attendance upon Queen Henrietta Maria. Having persuaded the queen that he possessed influence with some of the principal officers in the army, he obtained from her a letter of recommendation to the king. Having gained access to the king, he set about using his influence with Oliver Cromwell, Henry Ireton, and others, with a view to mediating between them and the captive king; he was supported by John Ashburnham. The result was that a set of propositions emanating from the chiefs of the army were submitted to the king as a basis of reconciliation in July 1647. These the king scornfully rejected.

Berkeley received the king&#x27;s commands to attend him in his flight from Hampton Court on the night of 10 November 1647. The party pushed on towards Hampshire, and ultimately reached Lymington. Berkeley crossed the Solent and opened the matter to Robert Hammond, parliamentary governor of the Isle of Wight which was the king&#x27;s goal; Hammond was non-committal. The envoys then conducted Hammond to the king at Lymington, an act later much criticized. Charles felt he had no choice but saw nothing for it but to accompany Hammond to Carisbrooke Castle. After this exploit, Berkeley returned to London, still bent on using his influence with the army. Being badly received by the officers, and arraigned by the parliament as a delinquent, he returned to Paris.

==In exile==
In Paris, during the absence of John Byron, 1st Baron Byron in England, he obtained, through the influence, as it would seem, of Henry Jermyn, 1st Earl of St Albans, the post of temporary governor to the Duke of York (1648), and on the death of Byron (1652) took over the position. He acquired control of the Duke&#x27;s finances and endeavoured to bring about a match between the Duke and Marie de Longueville, but the French court refused approval. Berkeley himself paid court to Anne Villiers, Countess of Morton, widowed in 1651; she turned him down, perhaps on advice from Sir Edward Hyde. Berkeley and Hyde became enemies.

Between 1652 and 1655 Berkeley served under Turenne in the campaigns against Condé, and the Spaniards in Flanders, accompanying the Duke of York as a volunteer. When the Duke placed his sword at the disposal of Spain and crossed over into the Netherlands early in 1656, he was still accompanied by Berkeley. In the spring of the next year, he made a tour with the Duke through some of the principal cities of the Netherlands, took part in the campaigns of that and the following year, and at the request of the duke was raised to the peerage as Baron Berkeley &quot;of Stratton in Cornwall&quot;, by a patent dated at Brussels 19 May 1658.

==After the Restoration==
On the Restoration Berkeley was put on the staff of the Admiralty. In 1661 he was appointed Lord President of Connaught for life, a deputy being appointed to do the work of the office in Ireland. In 1663 (17 June) Berkeley was sworn a member of the Privy Council, and in the following year was made one of the Masters of Ordinance. In January 1665 Berkeley was placed on the Committee of Tangier. In 1670 he went to Ireland as Lord Lieutenant, holding the office for two years, with a few months&#x27; leaves of absence. He was considered pro-Catholic, and to favour Archbishop Peter Talbot to the extent of allowing him to use a silver plate to add to the magnificence of a religious celebration, and expressing a desire to see a high mass at Christ Church. In December 1675 Berkeley was appointed, with Sir William Temple and Sir Leoline Jenkyns, ambassador extraordinary on the part of England at the Congress of Nijmegen then about to assemble, but bad health both delayed his departure for Nijmegen, which he finally reached in November 1676, and caused him to return the following May, before the conference finished.

==New Jersey interests==
Berkeley&#x27;s personal relationships with Charles II and the Duke of York led to his receiving an interest in New Jersey, in addition to that in Carolina previously received. Berkeley was co-proprietor of New Jersey from 1664 to 1674. In 1665, Berkeley and Sir George Carteret drafted the Concession and Agreement, a proclamation for the structure of the government for the Province of New Jersey. The document also provided freedom of religion in the colony. Berkeley sold his share to a group of Quakers because of the political difficulties between New York Governor Richard Nicolls, Carteret, and himself. This effectively split New Jersey into two colonies: East Jersey, belonging to Carteret, and West Jersey. The division remained until 1702 when West Jersey went bankrupt; the Crown then took back and subsequently re-unified the colony.

==Residences==

In 1665 he began building Berkeley House, his palatial London townhouse in the Italian style, on the north side of Piccadilly, near St James&#x27;s Palace in Westminster. It cost nearly £30,000 and was completed about 1673, upon Berkeley&#x27;s return from Ireland. The expansive grounds, today in Mayfair in Central London, are commemorated by the street names Bruton Street, Bruton Place, Bruton Lane, Stratton Street, Berkeley Street and Berkeley Square. It was renamed Devonshire House after its purchase in 1697 by William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire, and burned down in 1733 when replaced by a second Devonshire House. In 1668 Berkeley bought Twickenham Park in Middlesex, near London.

==Death and legacy==
On 26 August 1678 John Berkeley died, aged seventy-two years. He was buried on 5 September in St Mary&#x27;s Church, Twickenham. in which a memorial window commemorates him and his brother Sir William Berkeley.

Although John Berkeley held many distinguished offices, some authorities assert that, at one time, he was under a cloud, in consequence of his being detected in the selling of offices, and other corrupt practices. Samuel Pepys speaks of him as being esteemed &quot;a fortunate, though a passionate, and but weak man as to policy&quot;, and &quot;the hottest, fiery man in discourse, without any cause&quot;, he ever saw. Berkeley was notorious for spinning incredible tales of his exploits; Clarendon wrote that through constant re-telling he may have come to believe them himself.

==Family==

Berkeley married Christian or Christiana Riccard, daughter of Sir Andrew Riccard, a wealthy London merchant, in the East India Company; she had already been married first to Sir John Geare, and subsequently (14 February 1659) to Henry Rich, Lord Kensington, son of Robert Rich, 5th Earl of Warwick. He left three sons, each of whom succeeded in his turn to the title, and one daughter, Anne, who married Sir Dudley Cullum, Bart., of Hanstead, Suffolk. The title became extinct in 1773.

<doc id="234665" wikidata="Q185864" url="?curid=234665" title="Viverridae">
<text>Viverridae is a family of small to medium-sized feliform mammals, comprising 14 genera with 33 species. This family was named and first described by John Edward Gray in 1821. Viverrids occur all over Africa, southern Europe, South and Southeast Asia across the Wallace Line. The word viverridae comes from the Latin word .

The species of the subfamily Genettinae are known as genets and oyans. The viverrids of the subfamily Viverrinae are commonly called civets; the Paradoxurinae and most Hemigalinae species are called palm civets.

==Characteristics==
Viverrids have four or five toes on each foot and half-retractile claws. They have six incisors in each jaw and molars with two tubercular grinders behind in the upper jaw, and one in the lower jaw. The tongue is rough with sharp prickles. A pouch or gland occurs beneath the anus, but there is no cecum. The male&#x27;s urethral opening is directed backward.

Viverrids are the most primitive of all the families of feliform Carnivora and clearly less specialized than the Felidae. In external characteristics, they are distinguished from the Felidae by the longer muzzle and tuft of facial vibrissae between the lower jaw bones, and by the shorter limbs and the five-toed hind foot with the first digit present. The skull differs by the position of the postpalatine foramina on the maxilla, almost always well in advance of the maxillopalatine suture, and usually about the level of the second premolar; and by the distinct external division of the auditory bulla into its two elements either by a definite groove or, when rarely this is obliterated, by the depression of the tympanic bone in front of the swollen entotympanic. The typical dental formula is: , but the number may be reduced, although never to the same extent as in the Felidae.

Their flesh-shearing carnassial teeth are relatively undeveloped compared to those of other feliform carnivorans. Most viverrid species have a penis bone (a baculum).

==Classification==
===Living species===
In 1821, Gray defined this family as consisting of the genera &quot;Viverra&quot;, &quot;Genetta&quot;, &quot;Herpestes&quot;, and &quot;Suricata&quot;. Reginald Innes Pocock later redefined the family as containing a great number of highly diversified genera, and being susceptible of division into several subfamilies, based mainly on the structure of the feet and of some highly specialized scent glands, derived from the skin, which are present in most of the species and are situated in the region of the external generative organs. He subordinated the subfamilies Hemigalinae, Paradoxurinae, Prionodontinae, and Viverrinae to the Viverridae.

In 1833, Edward Turner Bennett described the Malagasy fossa (&quot;Cryptoprocta ferox&quot;) and subordinated the &quot;Cryptoprocta&quot; to the Viverridae. A molecular and morphological analysis based on DNA/DNA hybridization experiments suggests that &quot;Cryptoprocta&quot; does not belong within Viverridae, but is a member of the Eupleridae.

The African palm civet (&quot;Nandinia binotata&quot;) resembles the civets of the Viverridae, but is genetically distinct and belongs in its own monotypic family, the Nandiniidae. There is little dispute that the &quot;Poiana&quot; species are viverrids.

DNA analysis based on 29 carnivoran species, comprising 13 Viverrinae species and three species representing &quot;Paradoxurus&quot;, &quot;Paguma&quot; and Hemigalinae, confirmed Pocock&#x27;s assumption that the African linsang &quot;Poiana&quot; represents the sister group of the genus &quot;Genetta&quot;. The placement of &quot;Prionodon&quot; as the sister group of the family Felidae is strongly supported, and it was proposed that the Asiatic linsangs be placed in the monogeneric family Prionodontidae.

<doc id="234666" wikidata="Q152540" url="?curid=234666" title="Blind Guardian">
<text>Blind Guardian is a German power metal band formed in 1984 in Krefeld, West Germany. They are often credited as one of the seminal and most influential bands in the power metal and speed metal subgenres. Nine musicians have been part of the band&#x27;s lineup throughout its history, which currently includes singer Hansi Kürsch, guitarists André Olbrich and Marcus Siepen, and, since 2005, drummer Frederik Ehmke.

Blind Guardian is a key player in the German heavy metal scene that emerged in the mid-1980s. The band was formed in 1984 as Lucifer&#x27;s Heritage by Kürsch (who also played bass at the time), Olbrich, fellow guitarist Markus Dörk, and drummer Thomas Stauch. Dörk and Stauch left the following year and were replaced by Christof Theißen and Hans-Peter Frey, respectively, who also departed before the year ended. In 1987, Siepen joined the group, and Stauch returned; this lineup, which lasted 18 years (the longest in the band&#x27;s history), led the band to change their name to Blind Guardian and release their debut album, &quot;Battalions of Fear&quot;, in 1988. They have since released ten more studio albums, including an orchestral album released under the name Blind Guardian Twilight Orchestra.

Through their discography, Blind Guardian has established themselves as a notable and successful band and as pioneers of the power metal movement. In 1996, Kürsch ceased to act as the band&#x27;s bassist to focus on vocals, with various session musicians filling in, primarily Oliver Holzwarth. However, in 2005, Stauch left the band, expressing disapproval of Blind Guardian&#x27;s shift toward a more complex progressive sound with heavy backing vocals, and was replaced by Ehmke.

Most of Blind Guardian&#x27;s albums have been well received by fans and critics alike: &quot;Somewhere Far Beyond&quot; (1992), &quot;Imaginations from the Other Side&quot; (1995), and &quot;Nightfall in Middle-Earth&quot; (1998) are particularly regarded as influential works. The music is primarily composed by Kürsch and Olbrich together, while the lyrics, penned by Kürsch, draw inspiration from the works of fantasy authors such as J. R. R. Tolkien, Michael Moorcock, Stephen King, George R. R. Martin, and Robert Jordan, as well as traditional legends and epics. Over the years, a theme has developed that personifies the band members as traveling storytellers, leading fans to affectionately refer to them as &quot;The Bards.&quot; Blind Guardian has been described in one article as one of the &quot;big four&quot; bands of power metal, alongside Helloween, Sabaton, and DragonForce.

==History== 

===Formation as Lucifer&#x27;s Heritage (1984–1987)=== 
Blind Guardian was formed in 1984 in Krefeld, West Germany, by Hansi Kürsch (vocals, bass) and André Olbrich (guitar) under the name Lucifer&#x27;s Heritage, alongside Markus Dörk (guitar) and Thomen Stauch (drums). The band briefly expanded into a quintet with the addition of a second lead vocalist, Thomas Kelleners. However, after three months, Kelleners left the band by mutual agreement. Lucifer&#x27;s Heritage released two demos in 1985 and 1986, despite undergoing chaotic lineup changes: Dörk and Stauch were replaced by Christof Theißen and Hans-Peter Frey, respectively. Finally, in 1987, Marcus Siepen joined, and Stauch returned to form the lineup that would remain consistent for the next 18 years.

===Name Change and Rise to Success (1988–1996)=== 
After Lucifer&#x27;s Heritage signed a contract with No Remorse Records, the band changed their name to Blind Guardian to avoid any speculation regarding Satanism. In their biography, the band noted that they also wanted to distance themselves from the black metal movement, as their demos had been placed alongside black metal albums in local record shops. The new name was inspired by the Fates Warning album &quot;Awaken the Guardian&quot;. They released their debut album, &quot;Battalions of Fear&quot;, in 1988, which was essentially a speed metal album heavily influenced by Helloween. These two German bands had close ties, and Helloween founder Kai Hansen made a guest appearance on Blind Guardian&#x27;s second LP, &quot;Follow the Blind&quot; (1989), where the band revealed some thrash metal influences. Their third LP, &quot;Tales from the Twilight World&quot; (1990), showcased a much more melodic and &quot;epic&quot; sound, incorporating elements of choir and classical music.

Blind Guardian signed with Virgin Records in 1991 and released their fourth studio album, &quot;Somewhere Far Beyond&quot;, in 1992, followed by the live album &quot;Tokyo Tales&quot; in 1993. In 1994, Flemming Rasmussen, the former producer for Metallica, began working with the band, producing their fifth studio album, &quot;Imaginations from the Other Side&quot;, released in 1995, as well as &quot;The Forgotten Tales&quot;, an album that featured a mix of covers and original material, released in 1996.

===Later Years and Departure of Thomen Stauch (1997–2009)=== 
In 1998, Blind Guardian released their epic album &quot;Nightfall in Middle-Earth&quot;. Described by Allmusic&#x27;s Vincent Jeffries as &quot;complete with anthemic choruses, spoken word storylines, and plenty of bombastic power metal punctuating every dramatic turn,&quot; he stated that &quot;Nightfall in Middle-Earth is perhaps Blind Guardian&#x27;s most triumphant&quot; work. A concept album based on J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, the music on &quot;Nightfall&quot; demonstrated some folk rock influence while also featuring heavy use of Queen-style layered backing vocals. Following the release of &quot;Nightfall&quot;, bass duties were taken over by session member Oliver Holzwarth, allowing Hansi to focus entirely on vocals. This album also marked the last time Blind Guardian worked with producer Flemming Rasmussen.

Four years later, the band released &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot;, named after the Queen album. On this album, the band&#x27;s sound largely departed from their original speed metal influences, instead embracing power and progressive metal with over-the-top orchestral backing and consistent vocal and guitar layering throughout. While not a true concept album, many of the lyrics explored common themes of religion and the relationships between human and divine powers. This was followed by a live album in 2003 and a DVD, &quot;Imaginations Through the Looking Glass&quot;, in 2004, which was the last recorded Blind Guardian material featuring Thomen Stauch on drums. He departed from the band due to musical differences and was replaced by Frederik Ehmke. The first album with Ehmke was &quot;A Twist in the Myth&quot;, released in 2006.

Blind Guardian contributed to the soundtrack for the &quot;In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale&quot; fantasy film directed by Uwe Boll, which was released in 2008. The band also recorded a theme song for &quot;Sacred 2: Fallen Angel&quot;, a role-playing video game and the sequel to &quot;Sacred&quot;.

===At the Edge of Time and Beyond the Red Mirror (2010–2017)=== 
&quot;A Voice in the Dark&quot; was the next single from Blind Guardian, released on June 25, 2010. Following this, the album &quot;At the Edge of Time&quot; was released on July 30, 2010. To promote the album, the band embarked on &quot;The Sacred Worlds and Songs Divine Tour 2010,&quot; with opening acts including Enforcer and Steelwing for European dates, while Holy Grail and Seven Kingdoms opened for the U.S. shows. The band also announced they would perform at Wacken Open Air in 2011.

On July 21, 2011, Hansi Kürsch revealed on Blind Guardian&#x27;s official website that they were working on an orchestral album. On September 1, 2011, Oliver Holzwarth joined Rhapsody of Fire as a full-time member after 13 years as Blind Guardian&#x27;s session bassist.

On January 27, 2012, Blind Guardian released a compilation album titled &quot;Memories of a Time to Come&quot;, featuring re-recorded and remixed songs from their entire discography. Almost exactly one year later, on January 28, 2013, they released a box set titled &quot;A Traveler&#x27;s Guide to Space and Time&quot;, which included all of the band’s studio, live, and compilation albums from 1988 to 2004, along with some previously unreleased material.

On July 11, 2012, Hansi posted on the band’s official website that they would cease touring after their performance at the Rockharz festival in Ballenstedt, which occurred two days later. In his announcement, he mentioned the desire to focus on a new record before returning to the road by 2014. He also expressed a wish to perform songs they had never played live before their next tour.

In October 2013, Blind Guardian was announced as the headliner for the Out &amp; Loud Festival in Geiselwind on May 31, 2014. On October 18, 2013, Hansi shared an update via the official website, stating he expected the new record to be fully produced by May 2014. He confirmed that the album was progressing well and mentioned nine new songs by name: &quot;Irish Hill&quot; (later titled &quot;Grand Parade&quot;), &quot;Encrypted Time&quot;, &quot;Prophecies&quot;, &quot;Holy Grail&quot;, &quot;Winter&#x27;s Coming&quot;, &quot;The Throne&quot;, &quot;The Ocean&quot;, and &quot;Outcast&quot;, along with two others with uncertain titles, &quot;Song 9&quot; and &quot;Midtempo Song&quot;. 

The tenth Blind Guardian album, titled &quot;Beyond the Red Mirror&quot;, was released on January 30, 2015. The first single, &quot;Twilight of the Gods,&quot; was released on December 5, 2014. On January 28, 2015, two days before the release of &quot;Beyond the Red Mirror&quot;, Blind Guardian announced Barend Courbois as their new session/live bassist on their official Facebook page.

The band recorded live shows during the 2015 European leg of the Beyond the Red Mirror tour for a new live album, &quot;Live Beyond the Spheres&quot;, which was released on July 7, 2017.

===&quot;Legacy of the Dark Lands&quot; and &quot;The God Machine&quot; (2017–2023)===
When asked in July 2017 about the next Blind Guardian studio album, Kürsch stated, &quot;We haven&#x27;t done too much songwriting for the next regular Blind Guardian album, but still, we&#x27;ve made some steps at least, and I can sense a strong change in comparison to what we did on the last album. There&#x27;s one song called &#x27;Architect of Doom,&#x27; which is a truly heavy track. Very powerful. Very thrashy at points. And there&#x27;s another song called &#x27;American Goth,&#x27; which is kind of what you would expect from Blind Guardian, but the way we maintained the drums and the orchestra—this song features orchestral elements—makes it feel distinctly different. I&#x27;m pretty sure that you will notice a significant change when you listen to these two albums, and from that point of view, yes, &quot;Live Beyond the Spheres&quot; is the end of an era.&quot; He also mentioned that they were working on an orchestral album, which was originally scheduled to be finished and released in 2016, but was now due for release in 2019, followed by a &quot;heavy album&quot; slated for release in 2020.

The band&#x27;s long-awaited orchestral album, &quot;Legacy of the Dark Lands&quot;, was released on 1 November 2019, after Olbrich and Kürsch had conceived and written the project since 1996. It features only Kürsch as a performer, along with the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra, and is credited to the &quot;Blind Guardian Twilight Orchestra&quot; rather than the band&#x27;s regular name.

In November 2021, it was announced that a new single, &quot;Deliver Us From Evil,&quot; would be released on 3 December 2021, and that the band&#x27;s forthcoming twelfth album would be released in September 2022. Kürsch told Nuclear Blast, &quot;We know that the gap between now and the album release in late 2022 is painfully long. Neither we nor our label could defy the current worldwide economic crisis. A long story short: There is no one to blame for this situation... Talking about anticipation, even though &#x27;Violent Shadows&#x27; and &#x27;Deliver Us From Evil&#x27; are indisputably fantastic tracks, rest assured: We won&#x27;t let you wait another ten months with only two songs. I promise you, you will always be blown away—cheers to the digital era and its endless possibilities. Oh, and the album title. There is one, but I won&#x27;t tell you yet. This would be giving away far too much right now.&quot;

In July 2022, Jon Van Stratum replaced Barend Courbois as a session member. Despite persistent belief among some fans that he became a permanent member, Hansi Kürsch confirmed that he is only a live session member.

In May 2022, the title of the band&#x27;s twelfth album was announced as &quot;The God Machine&quot;, along with a release date of 2 September 2022.

===Upcoming 13th studio album (2024–present)===
In a February 2024 interview with Australia&#x27;s Subculture Entertainment, Kürsch revealed that Blind Guardian will commence &quot;real songwriting&quot; for their thirteenth studio album in 2025. When asked that same month if there would be &quot;a shorter turnaround time&quot; for the album, following a seven-year gap between &quot;Beyond the Red Mirror&quot; and &quot;The God Machine&quot;, Kürsch reiterated that the band will &quot;keep [their] focus on regular songwriting&quot; after their upcoming tour. Regarding a possible release date, he stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t know—I would be very surprised to find out that there&#x27;s no new Blind Guardian album before &#x27;27, which is an accomplishment already, but I&#x27;m hoping for either late &#x27;25 or &#x27;26.&quot;

==Musical style==
The musical style of Blind Guardian has been described as power metal, symphonic metal, progressive metal, speed metal, heavy metal, thrash metal, and neoclassical metal.

Blind Guardian&#x27;s first two albums, &quot;Battalions of Fear&quot; and &quot;Follow the Blind&quot;, were more in the style of speed metal compared to their subsequent works. Beginning with their third album, &quot;Tales from the Twilight World&quot;, Blind Guardian gradually started to write more intricate compositions, placing less emphasis on speed. By the time of their sixth album, &quot;Nightfall in Middle Earth&quot;, Hansi Kürsch ceased playing bass to concentrate solely on vocals. At this juncture, the band began to incorporate substantial orchestral arrangements and utilized the technique of overdubbing, heavily influenced by the English rock band Queen.

Blind Guardian&#x27;s music features the staccato guitars and double bass drumming characteristic of power metal, along with the use of overdubs and numerous backing vocals to create a rich and dense sound. This proved significant on all albums after the first two, but most particularly on &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot;.

Another defining feature of Blind Guardian&#x27;s music is the frequent use of folk tunes and instruments, especially in power ballads such as &quot;Lord of the Rings,&quot; &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Song,&quot; &quot;A Past and Future Secret,&quot; &quot;Skalds and Shadows,&quot; and &quot;Curse My Name,&quot; among others.

===Influences=== 
The band was initially inspired by their fellow countrymen Helloween, and in its early releases, it also displayed influences from Iron Maiden and Metallica. According to guitarist Marcus Siepen, during the songwriting for &quot;Follow the Blind&quot;, they also listened to Bay Area thrash metal bands, such as Testament and Forbidden, resulting in a somewhat heavier sound.

Starting with their third album, &quot;Tales from the Twilight World&quot;, and continuing through &quot;Somewhere Far Beyond&quot; and &quot;Imaginations from the Other Side&quot;, Blind Guardian gradually incorporated more influences from progressive and classical music. Queen had a significant impact, particularly concerning the choir arrangements and harmonies, an effect most notable on &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot;.

Singer Hansi Kürsch expressed the band&#x27;s attraction to 1970s progressive rock, citing early Genesis, Gentle Giant, and ELP as key influences. However, regarding the genre, he sees more direct influences in progressive metal bands, particularly Fates Warning, Queensrÿche, and Savatage. The folkloric influences on &quot;Nightfall in Middle-Earth&quot; primarily stem from British rock band Jethro Tull.

==Side projects== 
Along with Jon Schaffer, the leader and founder of Iced Earth, Kürsch was a member of Demons &amp; Wizards, where he served as the lead singer until its disbandment in early 2021 due to Schaffer&#x27;s involvement in the January 6 US Capitol attack.

Frederik Ehmke was a founding member of the band Sinbreed, in which Marcus Siepen was initially a session member. Later, in 2012, Marcus became a full member of the band.

Following the tsunami that struck Japan on 11 March 2011, Blind Guardian collaborated with their former record company, EMI Music, to auction an exclusive studio session for two at the Twilight Hall Studio in Grefrath, Germany, for charity. All proceeds were donated to tsunami relief efforts. The auction concluded on 22 April 2011 with a final bid of £1,171.00.

<text>Box lacrosse, also known as boxla, box, or indoor lacrosse, is an indoor version of lacrosse played mostly in North America. The game originated in the 1930s in Canada, where it is more popular than field lacrosse. Lacrosse is Canada&#x27;s official national summer sport. Box lacrosse is played between two teams of five players and one goalie each, and is traditionally played on an ice hockey rink once the ice has been removed or covered. The playing area is called a box, in contrast to the open playing field of field lacrosse. The object of the game is to use a lacrosse stick to catch, carry, and pass the ball in an effort to score by shooting a solid rubber lacrosse ball into the opponent&#x27;s goal. The highest level of box lacrosse is the National Lacrosse League.

While there are 62 total members of World Lacrosse, only fifteen have competed in international box lacrosse competition. Only Canada, the Haudenosaunee Nationals and the United States have finished in the top three places at the World Indoor Lacrosse Championships.

==History==
Lacrosse is a traditional indigenous people&#x27;s game and was first encountered by Europeans when French Jesuit missionaries in the St. Lawrence Valley witnessed the game in the 1630s. Lacrosse for centuries was seen as a key element of cultural identity and spiritual healing to the people of Turtle Island. It originated as a field game and was adopted first by Canadian, American, and English athletes as a field game, eventually settling on a 10 v 10 format.

Box lacrosse is a modern version of the game that was invented in Canada during the 1920s and 1930s. The roots of indoor lacrosse are obscure, but its invention has been attributed to one Paddy Brennan, a field lacrosse player and referee from Montreal, who, being annoyed by the constant slowing of play from balls going out of bounds in the field game, experimented with indoor games at the Mount Royal Arena during the early 1920s.

Joseph Cattarinich and Leo Dandurand, owners of the National Hockey League&#x27;s Montreal Canadiens in the 1920s, led the participating ice hockey arena owners to introduce the new sport. In the 1930s, 6 v 6 indoor lacrosse came to be played in the summer in unused hockey rinks. Canadians adopted the new version of the sport quickly. Eventually, it became the more popular version of the sport in Canada, supplanting field lacrosse. The form was also adopted as the primary version of the game played on Native American reservations in the US and Canada by Iroquois and other Native peoples. It is the only sport in which the American indigenous people are sanctioned to compete internationally, participating as the Iroquois Nationals. However, many field lacrosse enthusiasts viewed the new version of the sport with negativity.

The first professional box lacrosse games were held in 1931. That summer, the arena owners formed the &quot;International Lacrosse League&quot;, featuring four teams: the Montreal Canadiens, Montreal Maroons, Toronto Maple Leafs, and Cornwall Colts. The league lasted only two seasons. In the wake of the original &quot;International Lacrosse League&quot; opened the &quot;American Box Lacrosse League&quot; featuring six teams: two in New York City, and one each in Brooklyn, Toronto, Boston, and Baltimore. The league played to small crowds on outdoor fields such as Yankee Stadium and Fenway Park, before closing midway through its inaugural season. Lacrosse was officially declared Canada&#x27;s National Summer Sport with the passage of the (Bill C-212) on May 12, 1994.

The first box lacrosse match conducted in Australia came about as part of a fund raising appeal for the Queen Victoria Hospital, Melbourne. The Victorian Lacrosse Association was approached by the appeal committee to stage a lacrosse match as part of a multi sport carnival at the Plaza (Wattle Path Palais) ballroom at St Kilda on 1 July 1931. After a lightning six-a-side (outdoor) tournament format was successfully carried out a few weeks prior, it was decided to play six-a-side for this exhibition game between MCC and a composite team from other clubs, with players wearing rubber shoes and using a softer ball for the match. Newspaper articles at the time suggest that the sport may have even been created in Australia, with P. J. Lally of the famous Canadian lacrosse stick manufacturing company requesting a copy of the rules of the game from the VLA Secretary. By 1933, box lacrosse matches were being played in Adelaide, Brisbane, and Perth. This new version of the game however did not overtake the traditional version of lacrosse in popularity in Australia as happened in Canada.

The Canadian Lacrosse Association began sponsoring box lacrosse. In 1932, the Mann Cup, the most prestigious lacrosse trophy in Canada, was contended for under box lacrosse rules for the first time. Previously, the national senior men&#x27;s lacrosse championship, awarded since 1901, was competed for under field lacrosse rules. The Mann Cup is an annual tournament that presents the champion of the Western Lacrosse Association and Major Series Lacrosse in a best of seven national championship. A few years later, in 1937, the Minto Cup, began being awarded under box lacrosse rules to the junior men&#x27;s champions. Currently the Canadian Lacrosse Association oversees the Mann Cup, the Minto Cup, the Presidents Cup (Senior B national championship) the Founders Cup (Junior B national championship) all under box lacrosse rules.

Briefly in 1939, a professional box lacrosse league started up in California, called the &quot;Pacific Coast Lacrosse Association&quot;. This four team league also folded shortly after opening. Professional box lacrosse did not return to the United States again until 1968 when the Portland Adanacs and Detroit Olympics franchises played in the National Lacrosse Association, a circuit that folded after one summer season.

A new professional indoor lacrosse league was created in the 1970s with the formation of the original National Lacrosse League. This league opened in 1974 with teams in Montreal, Toronto, Rochester, Syracuse, Philadelphia, and Maryland. For the 1975 season, Rochester moved to Boston, Syracuse moved to Quebec City, and Toronto moved to Long Island. Thus, by its second year, the original NLL was playing in all major league arenas: the Colisée de Québec, the Montreal Forum, the Boston Garden, Nassau Coliseum, the Spectrum, and the Capital Centre. When the two wealthier &#x27;75 NLL franchises, Philadelphia and Maryland, finished out of the playoffs, and with Montreal losing access to the fabled Montreal Forum in the upcoming season due to the 1976 Montreal Olympic Games, the league folded after two seasons due to financial uncertainty.

The rebirth of professional box lacrosse in the United States came on March 13, 1986, with the formation of the Eagle Pro Box Lacrosse League, which was incorporated by Russ Cline and Chris Fritz. The league originated with four teams: the Philadelphia Wings, New Jersey Saints, Washington Wave, and Baltimore Thunder, and unlike box lacrosse generally, was played during the winter. The league rebranded itself as the Major Indoor Lacrosse League (MILL) immediately after its inaugural season, and in 1998 renamed itself again, this time to the NLL. In 1998, the NLL entered into the Canadian market for the first time with the Ontario Raiders. Although five of the league&#x27;s nine teams are based in American cities, more than two-thirds of the players are Canadian.

On June 29, 2022, a group of Lacrosse fans announced a new league the Professional Box Lacrosse Association. The league spokesperson identified nine teams which will be in cities in the United States.

==Rules==

===Players, equipment and officials===
During play, a team consists of six players: a goaltender and five &quot;runners&quot;. A runner is any non-goalkeeper position player, including forwards, transition players, and defenders. Runners usually specialize in one of these roles and substitute off the field when the ball moves from one end to the other. When the sport originated teams played with six runners. However, in 1953 the sixth runner, a position called rover, was eliminated. The goalkeeper can be replaced by another runner, often when a delayed penalty has been called on the other team or at the end of games by teams that are behind to help score goals.

A player&#x27;s lacrosse stick must be between and in length (youth levels may use shorter sticks). In most box lacrosse leagues, the use of a traditional wooden stick is allowed. However, almost no lacrosse players use wooden sticks any more, preferring aluminum or another metal, and a plastic head. In the NLL, wooden lacrosse sticks are not allowed. Besides a lacrosse stick, each player must also wear a certain amount of protective equipment, including a lacrosse helmet with face mask, lacrosse gloves, arm and shoulder pads, and back/kidney pads. Rib pads are optional in some leagues.

In some box leagues, especially the NLL, the five &quot;runners&quot; wear helmets specifically designed for box lacrosse. These helmets consist of a hockey helmet with a box lacrosse face mask attached instead of a hockey cage.

During a typical game the number of officials can range from one to three, depending on the league and level of play. In most games there are at least two referees: a lead official and a trail official. In NLL games there are three officials per game.

====Goaltender====

The goaltender&#x27;s responsibility is to prevent the opposition from scoring goals by directly defending the net. Box lacrosse goaltenders equipment includes upper body gear (measuring no more than up and out off the shoulder—much larger than similar gear for field lacrosse or ice hockey goaltenders), large shin guards that must measure no more than at the knee, at the top of the shin and at the ankle, and a field lacrosse helmet or ice hockey goalie mask.

The to radius area surrounding the net is called the &quot;crease&quot;. Players except for the goaltender may not enter the crease while playing the ball. Punishments for crease infractions include a change of possession, resetting of the time-clock, or a possible two-minute penalty depending on the infraction. Opposing players may not make contact with the goaltender while he is in the crease. Once he leaves the crease, however, he loses all goaltender privileges.

Even as box lacrosse grows in the United States, the American goalkeeper is a rarity. The skills required to be a successful field lacrosse goaltender and a successful box lacrosse goaltender are very different and do not lend well to one another.

====Defenders====
A defender is a player position whose primary responsibility is to prevent the opposing team from scoring. Unlike in field lacrosse where some defensive players carry longer sticks, all box lacrosse defenders play with a maximum long stick. Defensive tactics include cross checking (where a player uses the shaft of his stick to push the opposition player off balance), body checking (where a player makes contact with the opposition player in order to slow him down), and stick checking (where a player makes contact with the opposition player&#x27;s stick in order to knock the ball loose).

====Transition====
A transition player is a player whose responsibility is primarily to play during defensive situations with an offensive mindset. The goal of this player is to create fast breaks and scoring opportunities.

====Attack====
An attack is a player position on the field whose responsibility is primarily offensive. Typically, an Attack is dominant throwing with one hand or the other, and will primarily play on that side of the floor. Some players, known as creasemen, do not focus on one side or the other. These players instead focus their offensive attention near the crease area in front of the goaltender.

===Playing area===
The playing area of box lacrosse is typically an ice hockey rink during the summer months. The playing surface is usually the concrete floor underneath the melted ice. Generally the playing area is to in length and to in width. The NLL plays on artificial turf placed on top of the ice. Some leagues, and teams that have dedicated box lacrosse arenas (such as the Iroquois), have outfitted their playing surface with artificial turf similar to the NLL.

Box lacrosse goal dimensions are traditionally wide by tall. In the NLL, the dimensions are slightly larger at wide by tall. These nets are significantly smaller than field lacrosse nets which measure wide by tall.

===Duration and tie-breaking methods===
A traditional game played under the rules of the Canadian Lacrosse Association consists of three periods of 20 minutes each (similar to ice hockey), with the teams changing ends each period. The NLL plays four 15-minute quarters rather than three periods. If the game is tied at the end of regulation play, a 5-minute overtime (15 in NLL) can be played. Overtime may or may not be sudden victory, depending on the league.

===Ball in and out of play===

Each period, and after each goal scored, play is restarted with a face-off. If a ball travels over the boards and outside of the playing area, play is restarted by possession being awarded to the opposing team to that which last touched the ball.

During play, teams may substitute players in and out freely. Sometimes this is referred to as &quot;on the fly&quot; substitution. Substitution must occur within the designated exchange area in front of the players bench in order to be legal. The sport utilizes a shot clock and the attacking team must take a shot on goal within 30 seconds of gaining possession of the ball. In addition, players must advance the ball from their own defensive end to the offensive half of the floor within 10 seconds (8 in NLL).

===Penalties===

For most penalties, the offending player is sent to the penalty box and his team has to play without him and with one less player for a short amount of time. Most penalties last for two minutes unless a major penalty has been assessed. The team that has taken the penalty is said to be playing shorthanded while the other team is on the power play.

A two-minute minor penalty is often called for lesser infractions such as slashing, tripping, elbowing, roughing, too many players, illegal equipment, holding, or interference. Five-minute major penalties are called for especially violent instances of most minor infractions that result in intentional injury to an opponent, as well as for fighting. Players are released from the penalty box when either the penalty time expires, or the opposition scores a goal (or three goals for the instance of a major penalty).

At the officials&#x27; discretion a ten-minute misconduct penalty may be assessed. These are served in full by the penalized player, but his team may immediately substitute another player on the playing area unless a minor or major penalty is assessed in conjunction with the misconduct (a &quot;two-and-ten&quot; or &quot;five-and-ten&quot;). In that case, the team designates another player to serve the minor or major; both players go to the penalty box, but only the designee may not be replaced, and he is released upon the expiration of the two or five minutes. In addition, game misconducts are assessed for deliberate intent to inflict severe injury on an opponent. A player who receives a game misconduct is ejected and may not return to play. Receiving two major penalties in a game risks a game misconduct.
A penalty shot, where a player from the non-offending team is given an attempt to score a goal without opposition from any defending players except the goaltender, may be awarded under certain circumstances. By rule, teams must have at least three runners in play. If a team commits a third penalty resulting in a &quot;three man down&quot; situation a penalty shot is awarded in favour of having the offending player serve in the penalty box. A penalty shot may also be awarded, at the referee&#x27;s discretion, if a defensive player causes a foul to prevent a goal (by throwing his stick, holding, tripping, or by deliberately displacing the goal, or a defensive player intentionally falls and covers a ball in his own team&#x27;s crease). In the NLL, a penalty shot is awarded against any team taking a too-many-men penalty in the final two minutes of the game or overtime.

====Fighting====
Similar to fighting in ice hockey, fighting is tolerated in professional box lacrosse. Professional players are not automatically subject to ejection, but incur a five-minute major penalty. In Canadian Lacrosse Association play, players are assessed a five-minute major penalty plus a game misconduct. Fighting in youth or club level box lacrosse is typically penalized with expulsion and suspensions. In 1990, when the Six Nations created the new Mohawk lacrosse league, fighting was specifically targeted as unacceptable. Violators were ejected from the game in which the altercation occurred and given a minimum three-game suspension.

==International competition==
Box lacrosse is the most popular version of the sport in the Czech Republic. It is also played to a marginal degree in Australia, primarily by players who have played field lacrosse. Club level box lacrosse leagues in the United States have increased the number of players exposed to the sport, including the: Baltimore Indoor Lacrosse League, the Philadelphia Box Lacrosse Association, and the Metro Area Box Lacrosse League.

The first world championship of box lacrosse, &quot;The Nations in 1980&quot;, was staged in several arenas in British Columbia, Canada in July 1980 involving teams representing the United States, Australia, Canada East, Canada West and the Iroquois Nationals. Canada West (Coquitlam Adanacs) defeated the Iroquois in the nationally televised world championship game from Pacific Coliseum in Vancouver. This was the first time in history that competitors from the Indigenous peoples of the Americas represented themselves in an athletic world championship competition.

The second international box lacrosse tournament was held in 2003, with the inaugural World Indoor Lacrosse Championships. The competitors were national teams from Australia, Canada, the Czech Republic, the Iroquois Nationals, Scotland, and the United States.

The 2015 WILC was hosted by the Onondaga Nation in the United States which marks the first time an international sporting event has been held on indigenous land. Thirteen teams competed in the championship: Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, England, Finland, Germany, Iroquois Nationals, Ireland, Israel, Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United States.

Canada, Iroquois Nationals and the United States have won gold, silver, and bronze respectively in each of the World Indoor Lacrosse Championships held. Canada has yet to lose an international game in box lacrosse.

Other international tournaments have been played. Annually, the European Lacrosse Federation holds the Aleš Hřebeský Memorial tournament in Prague. This is the largest European box lacrosse tournament. In 2002 and 2004, the Heritage Cup was played between the United States and Canada featuring mostly players that were members of NLL teams.

==Women==
Historically, box lacrosse has been exclusively a men&#x27;s sport. Women who played the sport of lacrosse typically played the women&#x27;s field lacrosse version. Recently, Ontario, Alberta, Nova Scotia and British Columbia have established girls&#x27; and women&#x27;s box lacrosse leagues.

During the 2003 NLL season, goaltender Ginny Capicchioni appeared in two preseason and one regular season games to become the only woman to make an appearance in the NLL.

<doc id="234683" wikidata="Q591361" url="?curid=234683" title="Beatmania">
<text>(styled as beatmania) is a rhythm video game developed and distributed by Japanese game developer Konami and first released in December 1997. It contributed largely to the boom of music games in 1998, and the series expanded not only with arcade sequels, but also moved to home consoles and other portable devices, achieving a million unit sales. The Bemani line of music games from Konami is named after the series, was first adopted in the arcade release of &quot;Beatmania 3rdMix&quot; and kept ever since. The series came to an end with the last game being &quot;Beatmania The Final&quot;, released in 2002.

&quot;Beatmania&quot; gave birth to several spinoffs, such as the &quot;Beatmania IIDX&quot; series (a more advanced version featuring 7 keys and higher difficulty levels, and to this day still receiving new version updates) and the other being &quot;Beatmania III&quot;, a remake of the 5-key series which featured a more modern hardware platform, a pedal for optional effects and a 3.5&quot; floppy disk drive to save play records.

While the series was never ported to home computers, there have been unlicensed hard-drive copies which made it playable on a computer&#x27;s keyboard, or even with a modded PlayStation controller. Its popularity led to non-official simulators, with one of the most popular being &quot;BM98&quot;.

&quot;Beatmania&quot; and its variants have a following in Japan and all around the world. The password-based Internet Ranking service allowed competition wherever a machine is available. Today in the United States, many of the original Beatmania cabinets are in the hands of arcade collectors and Bemani enthusiasts, and consequently, are a rare sight at many arcades.

==Basic rules==

The player is a club DJ who must manipulate the controls according to the instructions on the screen to win the praise of the audience. Each game consists of a set number of songs of various difficulties, and each song must attain a certain degree of satisfaction from the audience in order to progress to the next.

The game controls consist of five plastic vertical rectangular keys that are arranged in a zigzag pattern like the letter &quot;M&quot; or in vibraphone type arranged. They resemble the layout of the keys of a piano (e.g. C, C#, D, D#, and E) and are color-coded in the same fashion, with the lower row white and the top row black. A turntable is to the right of the five keys, and is turned, or &quot;scratched&quot;.

Each key has a corresponding vertical bar onscreen, as does the turntable. The bars indicate the path which rectangular icons cascade down towards a horizontal line near the bottom of the screen. The player must hit the corresponding key or rotate the turntable when the icon matches the line, which will trigger a preset sound sample and recomposes the song properly. Players are judged for each key press for the accuracy of the timing on a scale of p-great (from &quot;perfect great&quot;; also called &quot;flashing great&quot;), great, good, bad and poor. Hitting keys/scratching when corresponding notes are absent will deplete a bar indicating the audience satisfaction. The passing range is shown on the bar as a red region on the right, and green for the failing range on the left. The game may end prematurely if the bar is completely depleted, but this depends on individual machine settings.

The unit of score in the game is &quot;money&quot;. A final grade (A – H) is given at the end of the game to indicate the player&#x27;s performance. This grade is not directly based on the &quot;money score&quot;, but is instead based on the player&#x27;s overall accuracy.

==Additional rules==
Various game modes are available, with different rule alterations that provide suitable challenges for players of various degrees of skill.

;Practice
:Featured in &quot;Beatmania 2ndMix&quot; and &quot;Beatmania&quot;, inexperienced players can go through a training stage with DJ Konami, a voice-over that walks the player through the basics of the game. After the training stage players can select songs normally and regardless of their performance won&#x27;t end a game prematurely. The voice over was not featured in any other Beatmania series game, although a similarly formatted Tutorial mode was recently added to the &quot;Beatmania IIDX&quot; games. Prior to practice mode players could choose to play a practice stage during normal games.

;Normal
:The regular mode. Players select songs and play normally. A pool of songs is available for every stage, with the next stage pool being more difficult than the last. Clearing is required to get to the next stage.

;Free
:Introduced in &quot;6thMIX&quot;, Free mode is another practice mode that follows all the rules of the Normal mode, with passing and failing scores, but allows the player to play all the predefined number of songs regardless of each song&#x27;s difficulty.

;Expert
:A mode for skilled players with courses that predefines the songs to be played. The rules for this mode have been modified throughout different versions of the game.
:*&quot;Beatmania&quot;
:*:Players must play through all the songs in a set order, with the audience bar dropping in greater degrees and increasing less. All the other rules follow the normal mode. Continues are allowed.
:*&quot;2ndMIX&quot;
:*:Different themed course are given, each running five songs long. The scoring rules follow that of the previous beatmania.
:*&quot;3rdMIX&quot;
:*:In addition to the courses format of 2ndMIX, the audience bar is now full from the beginning, and any decrease will carry onto the next stage, where good performance does not recover the bar. The audience bar is characteristically colored in red, and no continues are allowed upon game over.
:*&quot;completeMIX and after&quot;
:*:With the introduction of the Internet Ranking service, scores are now counted as 2 points for &quot;Just Great&quot; and 1 point for &quot;Great&quot;, which makes the overall EX Score. Upon completion of the course, a password is given to the player to submit to the official website for worldwide ranking. All of the Internet Ranking services have ended and are no longer available.
:*&quot;featuring &quot;Dreams Come True&quot;&quot;
:*:The Dreams Come True edition uses the same rules as CompleteMIX, but also features a minigame in between songs where a player can rapidly scratch to restore life.

;Expert+
:First offered in &quot;6thMIX&quot;, this mode is designed for the most skilled of players. A single course is provided, featuring ten of the most difficult songs in a particular version. The audience bar functions similarly to that of Expert mode, but falling to zero doesn&#x27;t result in an immediate game over. Rather, &quot;Danger&quot; is displayed on the screen, and it will take several subsequent misses to end the game. The bar is restored after each song, though the bar will be increased to just barely over &quot;Danger&quot;, should it have been in effect at the end of the song.

;Easy
:Available since &quot;3rdMIX&quot;, the Easy mode offers simplified playing sequences for songs. The selection of Easy and Hard modes were discarded altogether from &quot;6thMIX&quot; and after, with difficulty selection becoming options within the integrated Normal mode.

==Cabinet design==

Two major styles of the Beatmania cabinet were originally created, the standard cabinet, and the mini-style cabinet. The standard cabinet was taller and wider than the mini-style and included a 29&quot; screen, versus the 20&quot; screen on the mini cabinet. The 1P/2P/Effect buttons were placed on the vertical face of the cabinet on the mini, while placed between the keys, ahead of the coin drop on standard cabinets. The mini-cabinet contained 6 speakers, 4 normal mid/high range, and 2 larger subs. The standard cabinet contained 10 speakers, including the 2 subs. Functionally the game boards, HDD, and ROM chips were the same between cabinets. Finally, the mini cabinet had a smaller spacing between the turntable and the keys, and the turntable was approximately half the diameter of the standard version. Today the mini-cabinet is much more difficult to find, especially in the United States.

==Main artists==
&quot;Beatmania&quot; offers many musical genres from different disciplines of electronic music. Below are some of the artists who made frequent appearances in the series.

*dj nagureo/reo nagumo/tiger YAMATO and other aliases
*Mikio Endo
*Hiroshi Watanabe
*Hiroyuki Togo and other aliases
*Naoki Maeda and other aliases
*DJ TAKAWO
*RAM
*TAQ
*BEMANI Sound Team &quot;L.E.D, dj TAKA and TOMOSUKE&quot;

==Releases==
The &quot;Beatmania&quot; series has been released on multiple platforms in addition to its arcade releases. The majority of the games are featured on the PlayStation, but other console ports have also been featured on the Game Boy Color, and the WonderSwan.

Several key mixes were never ported to home or portable consoles, including Beatmania 7thMix and Beatmania The Final. There are many console-exclusive songs that were also never introduced in the Arcade releases—those include &quot;GOTTAMIX&quot; and &quot;THE SOUND OF TOKYO!&quot; respectively. Many songs were also released on one mix at the arcades but released in another style for the consumer versions. The best example of this was Gottamix 2, which contained consumer-exclusive songs in addition to the &quot;Complete Mix 2 Anothers&quot; that was released months earlier as an arcade exclusive.

<doc id="234684" wikidata="Q16937347" url="?curid=234684" title="KO Magazine">
<text>KO Magazine was a popular American boxing magazine. It was first published in 1980, to compete with &quot;The Ring&quot;.

It was founded by Stanley Weston, long-time publisher of numerous boxing and pro wrestling titles.

&quot;KO Magazine&quot;, nicknamed &quot;The Knockout Boxing Magazine&quot;, ran some popular features, such as a round-by-round section where the most important fights were described punch by punch, posters with the boxer&#x27;s complete records on the back, and a question and answer interview section.

Weston wanted &quot;KO&quot; to stand out above all other boxing magazines on the market, including the ones he published. It was meant to be a rival to &quot;The Ring&quot; and outsold that magazine for years. Peter King was editor from KO&#x27;s founding until his departure from the company in 1987.

Other key staff members included Steven Farhood, Richard Countis, Stu Saks, Jeff Ryan, Bill Apter and Ken Morgan.

Contributing writers included long-time boxing reporters Al Bernstein and Richard Hoffer.

Each issue contained rankings in 12 weight classes compiled by the editors.

Each issue also included letters from fans (&quot;Between Rounds&quot;), a color centerfold and an &quot;International Report&quot; which featured match results from around the world.

In September 2007, &quot;KO Magazine&quot; was acquired by Golden Boy Enterprises, along with &quot;The Ring&quot;. &quot;KO Magazine&quot; ceased publication following the acquisition.

<doc id="234685" wikidata="Q1756174" url="?curid=234685" title="Camber angle">
<text>Camber angle is one of the angles made by the wheels of a vehicle; specifically, it is the angle between the vertical axis of a wheel and the vertical axis of the vehicle when viewed from the front or rear. It is used in the creation of steering and suspension. If the top of the wheel is further out than the bottom (that is, tilted away from the axle), it is called positive camber; if the bottom of the wheel is further out than the top, it is called negative camber. 

== Effect on handling ==
Camber angle alters the handling qualities of some suspension designs; in particular, negative camber improves grip in corners especially with a short long arms suspension. This is because it places the tire at a better angle to the road, transmitting the centrifugal forces through the vertical plane of the tire rather than through a shear force across it. The centrifugal (outwards) force is compensated for by applying negative camber, which turns the contact surface of the tire outwards to match, maximizing the contact patch area. Note that this is only true for the outside tire during the turn; the inside tire would benefit most from positive camberagain, only with a short long arms system. However, due to the weight transfer inherent while turning, the outside wheels bear more of the force of turning and negative camber will improve handling overall. Caster angle will also compensate for this to a degree, as the top of the outside tire will tilt slightly inward, and the inner tire will respectively tilt outward. However, any camber affects the contact patch of the tire while driving in a straight line. Zero camber gives the best traction as it maximises the contact patch between the road and the tires and puts the tire tread flat on the road. Therefore excessive camber impairs straight driving in rain and snow and when accelerating hard. 

Proper management of camber angle is a major factor in suspension design, and must incorporate not only idealized geometric models, but also real-life behavior of the components; flex, distortion, elasticity, etc. What was once an art has become much more scientific with the use of computers, which can optimize all of the variables mathematically instead of relying on the designer&#x27;s intuition and experience. As a result, the handling of even low-priced automobiles has improved dramatically. Heavy-duty vehicles, such as tractors, trucks, etc., tend to have more positive camber angle, so that when they are loaded and the whole vehicle lowers, the wheels are almost vertical.

==Adjustability==
In cars with double wishbone suspensions, camber angle may be fixed or adjustable, but in MacPherson strut suspensions, it is normally fixed. The elimination of an available camber adjustment may reduce maintenance requirements, but if the car is lowered by use of shortened springs, the camber angle will change. Excessive camber angle can lead to increased tire wear and impaired handling. Significant suspension modifications may correspondingly require that the upper control arm or strut mounting points be altered to allow for some inward or outward movement, relative to the longitudinal centerline of the vehicle, for camber adjustment. With aftermarket plates containing slots for strut mounts instead of merely holes, this allows the entire shock absorber to be able to move back and forth, allowing for fine-tuning the camber of a vehicle. These plates are available for most of the commonly modified models of cars. Some aftermarket coilovers come with built-in camber plates already in place, and there are certain other aftermarket solutions which allow the modification of the camber angle of the wheels. Camber bolts with eccentrics allow adjustable camber on some vehicles. These bolts feature large washers that are either eccentric or offset. If the original-equipment bolts are replaced with eccentric ones, then the adjustment will engender a change of up to two degrees. Control arms (or A-arms) with adjustable ball joints represent another avenue for allowing side-by-side adjustability. With these control arms installed, tire camber can effectively be changed by simply moving the tires. After that, one tightens the bolts in order to lock the ball joint in the desired position. Yet another aftermarket solution for changing the camber angle is via control rods of adjustable length. However, this solution is only amenable to vehicles which employ control rods, not A-arms. Because control rods (in vehicles so equipped) are responsible for locating the suspension points and keeping them in place, changing the overall length of the rods influences the camber angle.

== Camber in uneven terrain ==

Off-road vehicles such as agricultural tractors generally use positive camber. In such vehicles, the positive camber angle helps achieve a lower steering effort. Also, some single-engined general-aviation aircraft that are primarily meant to operate from unimproved surfaces, such as bush planes and cropdusters, have their taildragger gear&#x27;s main wheels equipped with positive-cambered main wheels to better handle the deflection of the landing gear, as the aircraft settles on rough, unpaved airstrips.

== Camber wear ==

If excessive cambereither positive or negativeis applied, the vehicle&#x27;s tires will wear unevenly, a condition known as &quot;camber wear&quot;. 

A suspension with excessive negative camber places more load on the inboard shoulder of the tire, causing the inboard shoulder to wear out quicker than the outboard shoulder. Depending on suspension design, a minor negative camber setting may slightly improve tire wear, as during turns the vehicle&#x27;s center of gravity shifts toward the outside of the outer wheel. On a vehicle with zero camber this places load on the outboard shoulder of the tire, causing uneven wear over time. A small negative camber angle allows this load to be more evenly distributed across the tread.

Positive camber will generally place more load on the outboard shoulder, causing it to wear more quickly than the inboard shoulder. This is among the many reasons vehicles are not typically aligned with extreme positive or negative camber settings from the factory.

== Stance cars ==


Negative camber was primarily used in motor sports due to the traction increase around turns. However, it eventually became popular to use negative camber in order to be able to lower a car and fit wheels on it which would not normally fit in the fender wells. Cars with these modifications eventually were given the name &quot;stance cars&quot;. It is difficult to pinpoint when exactly this trend began, although it became mainstream in the 1970s with the &quot;bōsōzoku&quot; cars coming out of Japan. This trend began with the intent of making street cars look more like race cars by lowering their suspension and adding a little negative camber. As time went by, such cars were being customarily lowered more and more, as well as having much more negative camber than before. With the growing of stance-car culture, it also attracted criticism, since extreme amounts of negative camber and minimal ground clearance can make these cars impractical. Accordingly they sometimes became the subject of ridicule from other car enthusiasts, who enjoyed sharing videos of such cars getting stuck on speed bumps.

== Notes ==
:1.While nearly all automobiles now use &quot;negative camber&quot; on all four wheels, this convention dates from a time period when positive camber was more common.

<doc id="234687" wikidata="Q503982" url="?curid=234687" title="Battle of Mycale">
<text>The Battle of Mycale (; &quot;Machē tēs Mykalēs&quot;) was one of the two major battles (the other being the Battle of Plataea) that ended the second Persian invasion of Greece during the Greco-Persian Wars. It took place on 27 or 28 August, 479BC on the slopes of Mount Mycale, located on the coast of Ionia opposite the island of Samos. The battle was fought between an alliance of Greek city-states, including Sparta, Athens and Corinth; and the Persian Empire of Xerxes I.

The previous year, the Persian invasion force, led by Xerxes himself, had scored victories at the battles of Thermopylae and Artemisium, and conquered Thessaly, Boeotia and Attica; however, at the ensuing Battle of Salamis, the allied Greek navies had won an unlikely victory, and therefore prevented the conquest of the Peloponnese. Xerxes then retreated, leaving his general Mardonius with a substantial army to finish off the Greeks the following year.

In the summer of 479BC, the Greeks assembled an army, and marched to confront Mardonius at the Battle of Plataea. At the same time, the allied fleet sailed to Samos, where the demoralized remnants of the Persian navy were based. The Persians, seeking to avoid a battle, beached their fleet below the slopes of Mycale, and built a palisaded camp with the support of a Persian army group. The Greek commander Leotychides decided to attack the Persians anyway, landing the fleet&#x27;s complement of marines to do so.

Although the Persian forces put up a sturdy resistance, the heavily armored Greek hoplites eventually routed the Persian troops, who fled to their camp. The Ionian Greek contingents in the Persian army defected, and the camp was assailed, with a large number of Persians slaughtered. The Persian ships were then captured and burned. The complete destruction of the Persian navy, along with the destruction of Mardonius&#x27; army at Plataea, allegedly on the same day as the Battle of Mycale, decisively ended the invasion of Greece. After Plataea and Mycale, the allied Greeks would take the offensive against the Persians, marking a new phase of the Greco-Persian Wars.

==Background==
After Xerxes I was crowned the emperor of the Achaemenid Empire, he quickly resumed preparations for the invasion of Greece, including building two pontoon bridges across the Hellespont. A congress of city states met at Corinth in late autumn of 481BC, and a confederate alliance of Greek city-states was formed, generally referred to as the Allies. In August 480BC, after hearing of Xerxes&#x27; approach, a small Allied army led by the Spartan king Leonidas I blocked the Pass of Thermopylae, whilst an Athenian-dominated navy sailed to the Straits of Artemisium. Famously, the vastly outnumbered Greek army held Thermopylae against the Persians army for six days in total, before being outflanked by the Persians who used an unknown mountain path. The Persians also managed a costly naval triumph at the Battle of Artemisium, where they forced the Greek fleet to withdraw and thus captured the Euripus Strait.

After Thermopylae, the Persian army had burned and sacked the Boeotian cities which had not surrendered, namely Plataea and Thespiae, before taking possession of the now-evacuated city of Athens. The allied army, meanwhile, prepared to defend the Isthmus of Corinth. The ensuing naval Battle of Salamis ended in a decisive victory for the Allies, marking a turning point in the conflict. Following the defeat of his navy at Salamis, Xerxes retreated to Asia with a minor portion of his army.

The Persian fleet had been stationed in Samos in order to defend Ionia and avert an Ionian revolt. The Persians were not expecting the Greeks to mount a naval attack on the other end of the Aegean Sea, because the Greeks had not followed through on their victory at Salamis by chasing the Persian fleet. However, the morale of the Persian fleet was breaking, and they were anxiously awaiting new reports on the status of the land army led by Mardonius. According to historian Charles Hignett, it was clear that only the triumph of the Persian land army in Greece could sustain Persian rule in Ionia.

Xerxes left Mardonius with most of his army, and the latter decided to camp for the winter in Thessaly. The 110 ships of the Greek fleet were anchored at Aegina under the command of the Spartan king Leotychides in the spring of 479BC. Six people from Chios who had made an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow Strattis, their ruling tyrant, escaped to Sparta. They requested the Spartan ephors to free Ionia, and the latter sent them to Leotychides. They managed to persuade the Greek fleet to move to Delos. The Greeks hesitated to sail anywhere farther than Delos; because they were unfamiliar with the lands which lay there, thought they were full of armed peoples and believed the journey was too long. The Greek and Persian fleets stayed in their positions, apprehensive of moving closer to their opponent. Meanwhile, the Athenian navy under Xanthippus had joined with the Allied fleet off Delos. The historian J. B. Bury notes that it was the common position of the Athenians to make their fleet stay idle till a land battle was fought.

They were then approached by a delegation from Samos under the leadership of Hegesistratos in the month of July, who said the Ionian cities were eager to revolt. They also pointed out the poor morale and reduced seaworthiness of the Persian fleet, the latter had occurred probably due to the long time it had spent at sea. Leotychides found Hegesistratos&#x27; name to be a good omen, since it meant &quot;Army Leader&quot;. The delegation from Samos, as envoys of their nation, pledged their loyalty to the Hellenic alliance. Leotychides and the council of war decided to exploit this opportunity and sailed for Samos. The route he took probably began from the Cyclades, it then inolved sailing for approximately in the open ocean, passing Icaria and Coressia to finally land near Mount Ampelus in Samos. 

The Persians withdrew from Samos; Hignett argues that by doing so, they left to the Greeks an advantageous post which was the strongest on the Ionian coast. The Persians at Samos had control of the best harbor in all of the Aegean Sea and a great water supply. The historian John Barron argues that their retreat was not absurd: the channel was just about wide at its thinnest point, therefore, the Greeks could not send their entire fleet after the Persians. But the Persians did not force a battle and did not move to the excellent harbor at Miletus, instead choosing to land at Mycale, where Barron says they could observe the Greeks but the Greeks could not see them. Barron notes the absolute breakdown of the will to fight of the Persians at this point. 

The historians Michael Flower and John Marincola argue that the Greeks may have decided to sail to Samos only because they were told about a potential Ionian revolt and about the disrepair of the Persian fleet. Flower and Marincola note that the Greeks had previously been quite hesitant to sail beyond Delos because of the Persian fleet. The historian Marcello Lupi also notes that the Greek fleet had sailed at the insistence of the Samians and had been unwilling to chase the Persians after Salamis, hesitating to move out of Delos.

Flower and Marincola argue that the envoys from Samos were more reliable than the envoys from Chios, since the latter were &quot;conspirators on the run&quot; while the former were the representatives of their people. They note how Hegesistratos had claimed there was a chance the Persian fleet could be seized with one maneuver. They argue that Leotychides may have considered this a risk he could take. They also note that the Greek fleet had already sailed for Samos when their ambassadors reported the dismissal of the Phoenician ships from the Persian fleet. 

The historian Peter Green argues that the Phoenician ships were dismissed either to defend the shores of Thrace and the Dardanelles; or because the Persian high command could not trust the Phoenicians after Salamis. Barron argues that the Phoenicians were dismissed due to their low morale. Historian Jack Balcer observes the error of the Persians in dismissing the Phoenicians, and claims the battle would have unfolded differently had the Phoenicians not been dismissed. Hignett argues that Leotychides was taking the risk of fighting a naval battle where the location and circumstances would be picked by the Persians, who could thus maximize their advantages. Barron argues that passing over the opportunity to destroy their opponent&#x27;s fleet would be an absurd decision to make for both the Persians and the Greeks, especially since the land war was coming to a close, and because both sides would be expecting the mustering of their opponent&#x27;s flotillas. Balcer notes how the original mission of the Greek fleet was not letting the Persian fleet reinforce Mardonius, and how the fleet took a bold decision to go on the offensive.

==Opposing forces==
===Persians===
Herodotus gives the size of the Persian fleet which wintered at Cyme at 300 ships. The Phoenician ships were dismissed from the Persian fleet before the battle, which reduced its strength further. The historian Charles Hignett found the fleet size of 300 ships to be too large, even if this number included the Phoenician ships. Tigranes was the commander of the Persian land forces at Mycale. Artaÿntes was the joint commander of the Persian fleet, and he appointed his nephew, Ithamitres, as the third commander of the fleet. Herodotus states that there were 60,000 soldiers in the Persian army. 

Hignett argues that Herodotus&#x27; own narrative of the battle contradicts these numbers, and claims that Tigranes could not have had more than 10,000 soldiers in his corps. Shepherd also estimates that Tigranes had around 10,000 soldiers; with an additional 3,000 Persian infantry who had disembarked from the ships. Shepherd also notes that Tigranes notably did not have cavalry contingents among his troops. Green estimates that there were approximately just 100 ships in the Persian fleet after the Phoenicians left. Barron also arrives at an estimate of 100 ships after this dismissal. Green estimates that Tigranes had only 6,000 soldiers with him, who were joined by the 4,000 marines in the Persian fleet, for a total of 10,000 combatants. Historian Richard Evans estimates that there were around 4,000 total combatants available to the Persians. 

===Greeks===
The historian estimates the Greek fleet had 110 ships. Burn notes that the figure of 250 ships is only stated by Ephorus. The standard complement of a trireme was 200 people, including 14 marines. Flower and Marincola estimate that the Greeks had 3,300 marines, with the 110 ships having 30 marines each. They note that the complement of marines on a trireme was probably not fixed, with Plutarch stating that there were 14 marines on each trireme at Salamis. Herodotus had said the Chian ships at the Battle of Lade had carried 40 marines each. Hignett also arrives at an estimate of 3,300 marines in the Greek force. He argues that there could not have been more than 6,000 marines, even if there were hoplites employed as rowers. This suggests that a trireme could probably carry a maximum of 40 to 45 soldiers, because triremes seem to have been easily destabilized by extra weight.

Evans estimates that there were 70 Athenian, 8 Spartan, 20 Corinthian, 3 Troezenian and 8 Sicyonian ships in the Greek fleet at Mycale. Supposing each ship had 10 hoplites on board, he comes up with the following order of battle: 700 hoplites from Athens, 200 from Corinth, 80 from Sicyon, 30 from Troezen and 80 from Sparta (probably helots); for a total of 1,100 hoplites. The historian David Asheri posits that the Athenians contributed 50 ships to the Greek fleet at Mycale.

Burn notes that the Greek contingent of marines was strong, and strongly considers the possibility that some of the Greek oarsmen served as light infantry. The historian George Cawkwell argues the Greeks had only 2,000 to 3,000 marines, because their ships had mostly naval personnel onboard. Flower and Marincola argue that the Athenians did not have the numbers to provide marines for 50 triremes and 8,000 hoplites at Plataea both at the same time. They thus argue that the claim of 250 ships in the Greek fleet is not realistic. Flower and Marincola also note that Leotychides and Xanthippus probably had equal powers, and posit that the military decisions were finalized by a majority vote.

Herodotus did not give a precise order of battle for Mycale in his account. The historian William Shepherd estimates Athens provided one-third of the ships; while Sparta and the Peloponnesian poleis may have contributed 10 and 20-30 ships respectively. Shepherd estimates Aegina and Corinth sent 10 ships each, and argues the allied Greek contingent at Mycale did not have more than 25,000 soldiers. Shepherd arrives at an estimate of 3,000 marines with 30 on each ship; and argues that the remaining 22,000 people onboard served mostly as light infantry, with some of them being employed as hoplites. Green&#x27;s estimate for the number of Greek combatants was 5,000 heavy infantry and 2,000 to 3,000 sailors serving as light infantry. An epigram from an &quot;agora&quot; (public square) in Megara says Megarians fought and suffered casualties in the battle of Mycale, but they are not mentioned in any account of the battle.

==Prelude==
When the Persians heard the Allied fleet was approaching, they set sail from Samos towards Mycale in the Ionian mainland, possibly because they had decided they could not fight a naval battle. During the chaos of their retreat, the Samians freed 500 Athenian captives. Burn argues the Persian fleet had anchored at Mycale because their commanders thought it would be &quot;useless to fight at sea&quot;. Cawkwell notes that the Persian fleet had moved from Samos to Mycale for protection according to Herodotus. Green argues the Persians retreated to Mycale because they could communicate easily with Sardis and retreat without trouble. The Persians arrived on the southern shore of Mycale, near a temple dedicated to the two Potnia (female goddesses), Demeter and Kore (Persephone). Another temple dedicated to Eleusinian Demeter was nearby; three temples dedicated to these same goddesses were also present on or near the battlefield of Plataea.

The Persians took away the armor and weapons of the Samians in their army, finding them unreliable. Furthermore, they sent the Milesians to their rear to guard the mountain passes of Mycale, suspecting the Milesians of wanting to defect. Hignett argues the Persian distrust of the Milesians was invented later, and notes that the Milesians were actually guarding the lines of communication and the mountain passes the Persians could use to retreat. To the south of these passes, on the beaches on the route from Samos, the Persians moored their fleet behind the cover of rocks, and built abatis (field fortifications) with the wood they had cut recently. They put up stakes (&quot;skolopes&quot;) on the ramparts, and as a result, the place where they had camped became known as Skolopoeis by Herodotus&#x27; time. With their preparations in place, the Persians decided to defend their position, primarily expecting a siege.

The camp was located near the Gaison river. The German archaeologist Theodor Wiegand suggested Domatia (modern day :tr:Doğanbey, Söke) as the site for the camp; while the German classicist Johannes Kromayer proposed a site near the modern village of Ak Bogaz. Shepherd proposes the village of Atburgazı as the site for the Persian camp and the battlefield. The historian Jan Zacharias van Rookhuijzen suggests Güllübahçe, Söke, the modern day site of the ancient city of New Priene, as another potential location for the battlefield of Mycale. The German philologist suggested a location between Atburgazı and Yuvaca, Söke as the site for the battlefield.

The Greeks encamped at Kalamoi (the Reeds), adjacent to the Heraion of Samos and around from the city. Their opponent was inactive, and thus were planning to not fight a battle, and instead attack the Persian communications center at the Hellespont. However, they decided to attack their opponent and his fleet, and moved towards Mycale, around from Samos by the naval route. Hignett argues that this decision indicated the Greeks were sure they could fight a decisive battle. The Greeks prepared for a naval battle in the event the Persians decided to fight at sea, but they had resolved to confront the Persian land army in case there was no naval battle. The Greek fleet moved towards the shore and called on the Ionians to revolt. The Greeks then sailed farther and their soldiers landed in a location beyond the line of sight of their opponents. Shepherd estimates this location was inside the bay and to the immediate west of the city of Priene. Herodotus reports that as the Allied Greeks approached the Persian camp, rumor spread amongst them of an Allied victory at Plataea earlier on in the day.
==The battle==
The Allies probably formed into two wings. On the left were the Athenians, Corinthians, Sicyonians and Troezenians; around half of the army, who took up positions starting from the shore and ending at the foothils of Mount Mycale. On the right were the Spartans with the other contingents, deployed on the hills in uneven terrain. The battle of Mycale commenced in the afternoon on the same day as the battle of Plataea, which the historian Paul A. Rahe estimates took place on 27 or 28 August. Hignett also proposes a date in late August. The battle began when the Greek left began fighting with the Persians while their right wing was still crossing the hills. The Persians moved out from their camp and put up their shield wall. Burn argues that Tigranes wanted to vanquish half of the Greeks facing him while the other half had still not arrived on the battlefield. Green argues that sending only the flank led by the Athenians at first was actually a tactical move by Leotychides, who wanted the Persians to think they had a large advantage in numbers. Green claims the Persians fell for the ruse and rushed to attack the Greeks.

The Greek right, under heavy arrow fire, decided to fight in close quarters. Until the Persian shield wall was unbroken, the Persians defended their position. At this point, the contingents on the Greek right encouraged each other by saying the victory should belong to them and not to the Spartans. They increased their efforts, and managed to break through the wall by shoving. Tigranes and Mardontes died in the ensuing combat. The Persians fought back initially, but then broke their lines and escaped to their camp. The soldiers of the right wing followed them into the camp, and most of the Persian soldiers fled from the camp, except the ethnic Persian troops, who grouped together and fought the Allied soldiers who had entered the camp. Finally, the left wing arrived, outflanking the camp and falling on the rear of the remaining Persian forces, thereby completing the rout.

Herodotus says the disarmed Samians had joined the Allied Greeks on seeing the outcome of the battle hung in the balance. This inspired the other Ionian contingents to turn on the Persians as well. Meanwhile, the Milesians who were guarding the passes of Mycale also turned on the Persians. At first, they misdirected the fleeing Persian contingents, who then ended up back amongst the Allied troops; then, perhaps seeing the outcome of the battle was certain, they began killing the fleeing Persians. The Greeks then burned the Persian fleet after a heavily contested fight with the Persian marines, after taking out the loot from the ships and placing it on the beach. The Persian fortifications were also burnt.

Herodotus does not mention specific figures for casualties, merely saying that losses were heavy on both sides. The Sicyonians in particular suffered, also losing their general Perilaus. On the Persian side, the admiral Mardontes and the general Tigranes were both killed, though Artaÿntes and Ithamitres escaped. Green estimates the Persian casualties at 4,000. Hermolycus, an Athenian from the &quot;deme&quot; (suburb) of Scambonidae, was considered to have been the most gallant Greek soldier during the battle. The Athenians were considered the most courageous contingent on the battlefield, followed by the soldiers of Corinth, Troezen and Sicyon.

==Aftermath==

With the twin victories of Plataea and Mycale, the second Persian invasion of Greece was over. Moreover, the threat of a future invasion was abated; although the Greeks were worried Xerxes would try again, over time it was apparent that the Persian desire to conquer Greece was much diminished. The Greeks returned to Samos and discussed their next moves. The Allied fleet then moved to the Hellespont, sailed first to Lecton and then to Abydos to break down the pontoon bridges, but found them destroyed.

The Peloponnesians sailed home, but the Athenians remained to attack the Chersonesos, still held by the Persians. The Persians in the region and their allies made for Sestos, the strongest town in the region, and the Athenians laid siege to them there. After a protracted siege, Sestos fell to the Athenians, marking the beginning of a new phase in the Greco-Persian Wars, the Greek counterattack. The city-states of Chios, Lesbos and Samos joined the Hellenic alliance, and their Persian garrisons were eliminated. Strattis of Chios was overthrown, and the family of the poet Ion of Chios is highly likely to have played a role. The Greeks could not subdue Ionia entirely and could only free the Aegean islands. However, Thrace and Macedonia were able to break their alliance with the Persians because of the Greek victories at Plataea and Mycale. Also, the coastal areas of Lydia (Sparda), and the Asiatic Greek polities stretching from the Troad to Caria split off from the Persians.

After the battle, there were concerns over how the Greeks of Asia Minor could be defended against the potential Persian vengeance. The Peloponnesians suggested a population exchange, where the Greeks who did not want to live under Persian rule would be relocated in northern Greece, on the properties of the medizers who would be expelled. However, since all of northern Greece had surrendered to the Persians, this plan was abandoned. Also, Xanthippus had claimed the Greeks of Asia Minor were Athenian settlers, and thus Athens would not let their settlements be abandoned. The historian Joshua Nudell argues that this debate over the Ionians presaged the future war between Athens and Sparta, namely the Peloponnesian War.

Rahe argues the real reason Athens was trying to make its settlers stay in Ionia was because they could defend Athenian food imports from Crimea. Burn found this idea of a population exchange to have parallels with the population exchange between Greece and Turkey implemented 24 centuries later. Burn also found a repeat of the Battle of Mycale in the Battle of the Eurymedon, fought by the Athenian general Cimon against the Persians in 466BC. After Mycale, the state of Teos would create multiple imprecations to be used on people who exploited the role of the &quot;aesymnetes&quot; (elected official) to become tyrants. 

After the battle, the Persian marshal Masistes would accuse the surviving naval commanders of being cowards; Burn, however, argues they survived because they were just trying to get their non-Persian soldiers back to the battlefield. In the spring of 488BC, the tyrant of Cilicia, Xenagoras of Halicarnassus, recently appointed by emperor Xerxes, would raid the temple of Apollo at Didyma and seize the bronze idol of the deity, in revenge for the Milesians switching sides at Mycale. The historian Iain Spence argues the victory at Mycale reiterated the maritime supremacy of the Greeks. He further argues that the resultant defection of the Aegean states facilitated Greek marine campaigns, thus leading to the establishment of the naval empire of the Delian League and Athens. The Persian Empire&#x27;s borders were fixed and their numerous invasions became rare. After the Persian defeat at Mycale, the satrapy of Bactria began an armed revolt, which may have bolstered the resolve of Artabanus to assassinate Xerxes.

The historian David C. Yates notes that the states of Samos and Chios were not included on the list of states on the Serpent Column, even though they had a strong claim. He argues they were excluded because they had opposed the continued Spartan command of the Hellenic League. Yates also notes the presence of Spartan and Corinthian troops in all five battles of the Persian Wars, the only two states to have this distinction.

=== Spoils ===
Xanthippus captured the cables of the Persian bridges in Cardia after he took the town. Barron notes that the cables might have adorned the stylobates (column bases) of the newly built Temple of Athena Nike on the Acropolis of Athens. Fragments from the cables, mixed with stern decorations taken from the Persian ships at Mycale, were displayed at Delphi near the Temple&#x27;s terrace walls. An inscription near these displays said the Athenians had captured these items from the enemy, without mentioning the other Greek allies. The 4th centuryBC Athenian orator Demosthenes had thought the tall statue of Athena Promachos (Forefighter), completed and displayed on the Acropolis of Athens, was constructed with money from the loot taken at Plataea and Mycale. According to the Roman engineer Vitruvius, the &quot;masts and spars&quot; of the Persian ships were incorporated into the roof of the Odeon of Pericles at Athens.

==Analysis==

=== Strategies and tactics ===
Flower and Marincola note that the speech made by Hegesistratos has many similarities with the speech made by Aristagoras of Miletus, when the latter traveled to Sparta and Athens for gaining allies in support of the Ionian Revolt of 499BC. They observe that many of the predictions made by Hegesistratos did not materialise: the Ionians did not revolt when the Greeks arrived in Ionia, and did so only after the people of Samos and Miletus rebelled first. They note how odd it was for the Persians to not have attacked the Greeks while the latter were landing. They quote the 5th centuryBC Athenian general Demosthenes, who had said a naval landing could not be executed successfully when an opponent who held the land resolved to fight. Balcer argues the Persians should have deployed their fleet in the open sea and should not have built their fortifications. He further argues that the Persian defeats were the results of military and logistical mistakes committed by the Persians.
The historian George Cawkwell argues the major military lesson of both Mycale and Plataea was the repeated confirmation of the superiority of the hoplite over the more lightly armed Persian infantry, as demonstrated at the Battle of Marathon. As a result, after the Greco-Persian Wars, the Persian empire started recruiting and relying on Greek mercenaries. Cawkwell argues the numbers given by Herodotus are highly overstated. He further argues that the battle was a &quot;very minor affair&quot;, but its outcomes were major because it led to an Ionian revolt. Cawkwell observes that the withdrawal of the majority of the Persian fleet just before the battle of Mycale was a grave mistake. Cawkwell claims Tigranes didn&#x27;t have many soldiers with him. He argues the Persian fleet did not have the required number of soldiers to fight the Greek fleet, and sailed to Mycale only because of the presence of Tigranes&#x27; troops.Burn argues that the destruction of the Persian fleet at Mycale allowed Greek fleets absolute freedom of movement. The historian Muhammad Dandamayev agrees with this conclusion. The Persian and Median marines, as well as the Persian regiments in Tigranes&#x27; army, were almost completely massacred. In their absence, the Persian vassals had refused to fight and fled. The historian Paul A. Rahe argues the Persians had had ten months since the battle of Salamis to repair their fleet. He further argues that the Persian hesitation to fight a naval battle, despite their numerical superiority, indicated that either the morale of their commanders was shaken, or that they believed the soldiers in their army drawn from their Greek vassals would mutiny. Rahe argues that emperor Xerxes could have been the one who ordered his soldiers not to fight a naval battle and instead beach their ships.

Bury argues that the indecisiveness of the Spartans led to the Greeks of Asia Minor joining the Delian League led by Athens. He argues the Spartans left the Greeks of Asia Minor unprotected against the Persians, even though the latter had proposed the creation of a Hellenic League after Mycale. The hesitation of the Spartans to defend the Ionians and the desire of Athens to do so led to the competition and strife between the two superpowers throughout the 5th centuryBC. Till 478BC, Sparta was the only polity in Greece with numerous allies, however, Athens gained multiple allies after it become the dominant naval power.

The historian wonders why the Spartans, forever hesitant of embarking on naval campaigns to remote places, immediately agreed to sail to Samos after the visit of the envoys. Badi observes how strange it is for the Spartans to fight for the liberation of the Ionians at a time when the Greek mainland was still under Persian occupation. According to Diodorus Siculus, it was actually the Samians who had persuaded the Allied Greeks to attack the Persian fleet. Badi also questions the narrative of the allied Greek fleet mobilizing and sailing from Delos to Samos in one day, and says even a modern navy cannot move so quickly. The historian says the Greek triumph at Mycale was a strategic &quot;feat of the first order&quot;, however, it was probably not appreciated by the contemporary Greeks. He argues most members of the Greek fleet were volunteers, enticed by the spoils they could take. Wallinga argues the Persian commanders had made a reasonable decision by stowing their ships, because they could then be used in the future, instead of risking them in a one-sided battle where the Persians had the numerical advantage but the morale of their crews was broken.

=== Formations ===
Historian Richard Evans estimates the length of the beach in Mycale at during low tide. Evans argues the small beach would have restricted the deployment of a phalanx with a uniform depth of ranks. He posits that the Greeks would have used a wedge formation, with 700 Athenian hoplites deploying 50 ranks deep while the others deployed ten ranks deep. Assuming each hoplite took up of space, he estimates the Athenians deployed 14 rows and formed a line wide. Similarly, he expects the Corinthians to have deployed 20 rows, the Sicyonians and Spartans 8 rows each, and the Troezenians 3 rows. Evans then estimates the Greek line was long.

==Historiography==
The main source for the Greco-Persian Wars is the ancient Greek historian Herodotus. He gives an account of the battle of Mycale in Book Nine of his &quot;Histories&quot;. The historian noted multiple similarities in Herodotus&#x27; accounts, which he argued were arbitrary insertions by Herodotus. Fehling noted that the Spartan nauarch (fleet commander) at Mycale had used the same plan used by Themistocles at the Battle of Artemisium, and the Ionian tyrants at the Battle of Lade: calling upon the Ionians to switch sides. Fehling also notes how the shield wall fighting is always concluded by the Athenians in Herodotus&#x27; accounts, especially at Plataea and Mycale. Shepherd also notes the multiple similarities between Plataea and Mycale. However, he finds some major differences in the latter battle: the absence of cavalry; the Persian command&#x27;s lack of trust in their Greek vassal soldiers resulting in a lower force strength; and the reversal of Plataea at Mycale where the Greeks were the attackers and the Persians were the defenders. 

The historians Michael Flower and John Marincola also found these similarities between the battles of Plataea and Mycale to be suspicious, especially since the victories there gave both Sparta and Athens, respectively, similar triumphs on the same day. Flower and Marincola note that the victory at Mycale was not celebrated by any Athenian orators, who were otherwise proud of their other achievements in the Persian Wars. They argue this omission occurred because the leader at Mycale was a Spartan in what could be considered a naval battle, a domain where the Athenians believed they were better. 

Flower and Marincola note how the &quot;aristeia&quot; (heroic moment) of the Athenians takes place on Ionian lands, and wonder whether this part of Herodotus&#x27; account is structured to justify the Athenian claim to the command of the Delian League. Flower and Marincola find the account of Mycale given by Diodorus Siculus to be unreliable and mixed with arbitrary claims by Ephorus of Cyme, his primary source. Timaeus may also have been a source for Diodorus. Flower and Marincola note that in Herodotus&#x27; account, he mentions the burial of the fallen Greek soldiers after the battle of Thermopylae, but does not mention any burials after the battles of Mycale, Salamis or Marathon.The historian David Asheri found other similarities between Plataea and Mycale: the issue of defending the mountain passes, the deployment of the Athenians on the plains and the Spartans on the hills, the concluding heroic resistance of the few remaining Persian fighters and the delayed arrival of other Greek contingents on the battlefield. Asheri also noted a direct comparison between the battles of Mycale and Artemisium. Asheri argues the battle of Mycale was narrated by Herodotus from a religious perspective, and not from a strategic and military perspective. Asheri postulates that Herodotus used sources from Athens and Samos because of the biases towards these &quot;poleis&quot; in his account. Nudell argues that the Ionian betrayal of the Persians is overstated, perhaps invented to salvage the reputation of Greek states which had fought for the Persians.

The historian Henry Immerwahr posits that the battles of Plataea and Mycale are connected in a manner similar to how the battles of Thermopylae and Artemisium are connected. Badi also made note of these narrative structures, where a land battle and a naval battle are fought on the same day. Immerwahr notes how the Athenians at Mycale are shown to have been better combatants on land than the Spartans, which he believes to be a result of drawing from a pro-Athenian source. Hellanicus of Lesbos might have been the pro-Athenian and anti-Spartan source used by Herodotus. 

Immerwahr notes how the Athenian victory at Mycale offsets their defeat at Artemisium. Badi argues Herodotus clubbed his account of Mycale with Plataea because he wanted to &quot;superimpose&quot; an Athenian victory on a Spartan one. Badi argues the Athenian victory at Mycale was also given more prestige in Herodotus&#x27; account, because the victor had not been forced to retreat from their position, unlike at Plataea. Immerwahr observes how the divine was the key element in the accounts of Plataea and Mycale given by Herodotus, whose narrative of the latter battle did not focus at all on military matters. Historian Richard Evans thinks Herodotus based his account of Mycale on battle descriptions in Homer&#x27;s Iliad. Evans also notes the multiple parallels between Mycale and Thermopylae. Evans also notes Mycale to be the first battle in recorded history fought on a beach.

The historian Jan Zacharias van Rookhuijzen notes how Plutarch is the only ancient writer who described the victory at Mycale as something the Athenians took pride in. Plutarch, in his account, had also noted the Corinthian gallantry at Mycale. van Rookhuijzen notes how most ancient writers did not give the battle much thought, with Ephorus of Cyme being the only one who considered it to have some importance. Modern historians like Hignett and Cawkwell have claimed Herodotus also did not have much interest in the battle. Herodotus probably concluded his account with the battle of Mycale and the second Ionian revolt because he wanted to come full circle on the commencement of his account with the first Ionian Revolt.

Burn found Herodotus&#x27; account to be biased towards the Athenians. He also finds the battle of Mycale to have parallels with Plataea, as both battles saw only one flank engaged in combat, and both witnessed fighting at the Persian shield walls and camps. Hignett argues the similarities between the two battles are not suspicious and can naturally be expected. Burn says Mycale was a &quot;relatively small battle&quot;, and notes how Thucydides did not consider it as important as Salamis or Artemisium.

In the works of the tragic poet Phrynichus, the naval victories at Salamis and Mycale were the results of policies crafted by the Athenian commander Themistocles. The historian says Phyrnichus formed his opinions on the Persian Wars by emphasizing the two triumphs of the Greek navy at Salamis and Mycale. Stoessl notes that Aeschylus believed the Europeans and Asians should not cross the seas and intervene in each other&#x27;s countries. Stoessl says this is the reason for Aeschylus not even mentioning the battle of Mycale, precisely because it was fought in Asia Minor.

=== Ships ===
The historian Iain McDougall doubts the narrative of the Persian ships being burnt after the Greek victory at Mycale. He argues the ships would have been valuable items of loot, and notes how there is no historical precedent for such actions. The German classicist Karl Julius Beloch thought the Persians had burned their ships themselves; the Italian historian Giulio Giannelli thought the Athenians and especially Themistocles had burnt the ships, while Hignett thought only the Ionian ships in the Persian fleet were spared. McDougall argues the ships in the Persian fleet which were burnt primarily belonged to the Ionian Greeks, who he argues had contributed most of the ships present at Mycale. McDougall further argues the ships in the Persian fleet were greatly damaged and could not be salvaged, and were therefore burnt. Asheri also says the Greeks did not have the required numbers to staff the ships they could have captured from the Persian fleet; therefore, they preferred burning the ships instead of letting the Persians take them back.

McDougall and Wallinga argue the Persians had used wood from their ships to construct their field fortifications. Evans says this is not plausible, noting the statement by Herodotus, who says stones and tree trunks were used. Evans says the Persians were already quite exhausted, and stripping wood from their ships would have taken them too much time. Evans estimates there were 200 Persian ships, and says constructing a fortification to store all of them would be tough on the beach&#x27;s terrain. Assuming the ships were stored in columns of 70 and rows of three, and each ship took up of length, of width and an additional on both the top and bottom; the total length would be and the total width would be . Evans says this is too large a fort to be accommodated on beaches in the Mediterranean, where the length from the land to the water is not more than usually.

<text>USS &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; was a three-decked ship of the line of the United States Navy, rated at 130 guns, and named for the state of Pennsylvania. She was the largest United States sailing warship ever built, the equivalent of a first-rate of the British Royal Navy. Authorized in 1816 and launched in 1837, her only cruise was a single trip from Delaware Bay through Chesapeake Bay to the Norfolk Navy Yard. The ship became a receiving ship, and during the American Civil War was destroyed.

==History==

&quot;Pennsylvania&quot; was one of the &quot;nine ships to rate not less than 74 guns each&quot; authorized by the U.S. Congress on 29 April 1816. She was designed and built by Samuel Humphreys in the Philadelphia Navy Yard. Her keel was laid in September 1821, but tight budgets slowed her construction, preventing her being launched until 18 July 1837. The largest sailing warship ever built for the United States, she had three complete gun decks and a flush spar-deck and her hull was pierced for 136 guns.

Exploding shell guns were replacing solid shot by the time &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; was fitting out. A Bureau of Ordnance Gun Register for 1846 records her armament as follows:
* Spar deck: two 9-pounder (4 kg) cannons and one small brass swivel.
* Main deck: four 8 inch (203 mm) chambered cannons received from Norfolk in 1842, and thirty-two 32 pounder (15 kg) cannons.
* Middle deck: four 8 inch chambered cannons received from Norfolk in 1842, and thirty 32 pounder cannons.
* Lower deck: four 8 inch chambered cannons and 28 × 32 pounder cannons.

&quot;Pennsylvania&quot; shifted from her launching site to off Chester, Pennsylvania, on 29 November 1837 and was partially manned there the following day. Only 34 of her guns were noted as having been mounted on 3 December 1837. She stood downriver for New Castle, Delaware, 9 December, to receive gun carriages and other equippage before proceeding to the Norfolk Navy Yard (then called &quot;Gosport&quot;) for the coppering of her hull. She departed New Castle on 20 December 1837 and discharged the Delaware pilot on the 25th. That afternoon she sailed for the Virginia Capes. She came off the Norfolk dry dock on 2 January 1838. That day her crew transferred to &quot;Columbia&quot;.

A few days before 18 September 1838, &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; was driven ashore at Norfolk. She remained in ordinary until 1842 when she became a receiving ship for the Norfolk Navy Yard. She remained in the yard until 20 April 1861 when she was burned to the waterline to prevent her falling into Confederate hands. Her wreck was salvaged and broken up.

<doc id="234689" wikidata="Q438394" url="?curid=234689" title="Alternate Reality (series)">
<text>Alternate Reality (AR) is an unfinished role-playing video game series. It was created by Philip Price, who formed a development company called Paradise Programming. Published by Datasoft, &quot;AR: The City&quot; was released in 1985 and &quot;AR: The Dungeon&quot; was released in 1987. Price was unable to complete the second game in the series, and &quot;The Dungeon&quot; was finished by Ken Jordan and Dan Pinal. Gary Gilbertson created the music for both games.

==Concept==
Aliens have captured the player from Earth, and the player finds themself in front of a gate with a slot-machine-like row of rotating numbers of statistics. Stepping through the gate freezes the numbers and turns the player into a new person, putting them into an &quot;alternate reality&quot;, hence the name.

In 1988 Datasoft denied that the series would end after &quot;The Dungeon&quot;. The end of the series was to conclude with the player discovering everyone&#x27;s true bodies on the ship cocooned and effectively frozen, and that the ship is really a &quot;pleasure world&quot; of some kind for the aliens, leading to the player&#x27;s ultimate decision of what to do to the ship, to the aliens, or even whether to return to Earth. Only two games were finished and the series was never completed.

During the late 90s, Price intended to produce an MMORPG version of the game called &quot;Alternate Reality Online&quot; or &quot;ARO&quot;, and teamed with Monolith. The deal ended due to lack of funds to start serious development on the project. Monolith originally had funds, but needed the funds for existing games in the pipeline. Monolith tried to find an external publisher to fund the game, but the number of technical innovations, coupled with an unknown market for MMORPGs, made it difficult to find publishers willing to risk funding. The publication deal ended and the rights to the game were returned due to no funds. Monolith went on years later to create &quot;The Matrix Online&quot;.

==The &quot;Lost&quot; Games==
The original outline for the game series included plans for 6 games:

* The City
* The Arena
* The Palace
* The Wilderness
* Revelations
* Destiny

The first break from this outline was when Datasoft forced the release of &quot;The City&quot; early, and &quot;The Dungeon&quot; which would have been included, became its own release. Nonetheless, the design planned to allow the player to move between these games, so that, for example, when one attempted to leave the confines of &quot;The City&quot;, one was prompted to &quot;Insert disk #1 of Alternate Reality: The Wilderness&quot;. The planned seamless migration never worked out, in large part because the Datasoft developers did not implement the idea, so only the Atari 8-Bit city had the ability to boot sequels. Since the final coding of the sequels was done by Datasoft, the matching code was not put into any of the sequels, including the Atari 8-bit dungeon.

Although &quot;The Dungeon&quot; was completed and released, work on the remaining 5 installments never moved beyond theoretical outlines. A brief summary of these outlines follows:

===The City (and its sewers, which became The Dungeon)===

The player is thrust into a new environment (the city of Xebec&#x27;s Demise) and must learn to survive. While &quot;The City&quot; is mostly an open area planned to serve as the hub for the game series, &quot;The Dungeon&quot; was made up of four concentric levels, each one smaller than the one above.

===The Arena===
Slavers would be added to the City/Dungeon in order to capture new gladiators and force them into combat. This was similar to how the player was captured from Earth in the first place, causing the player to once again be thrust into a new environment. The plan also included provisions for players to enter the arena in other ways, e.g., as a spectator or a free man. A limited &quot;character vs. character&quot; mode would allow characters from other saved games to be loaded in and pitted against the current character. Lastly, there would be one or more ways to retire a character into a life of luxury, thus &quot;winning&quot;, but players would need to start a new character if they wanted to continue on in the series. Retired characters would then return as opponents faced by any new characters.

===The Palace===
Planned to feature courtly intrigue and the ability to purchase land in the city, with the capability to alter the map and building layouts if one built new sections or tore down walls. Players could climb the ladder of power and responsibility, and eventually choose to rule the city as its new king. This was intended as another way to retire a character and thus &quot;win&quot;. New characters created would be able to meet the previously crowned king, or even attempt to overthrow him.

===The Wilderness===
&quot;The Wilderness&quot; was to be a pilgrimage to find the truth concerning &quot;Alternate Reality&quot;. There would be traps, tricks to waylay the adventurer, and diversions to turn him or her away from the true quest. This expansion would feature a vast expanse of outdoor terrain and new areas to explore.

===Revelation===
With the illusion broken, the player would find his or her way onto the alien ship and out of the holo-world upon which he or she was previously trapped. There was to be a way into the ship through the bottom of &quot;The Dungeon&quot; (on the 4th level), as well as in the distant wilderness.

===Destiny===

Now armed with high tech equipment and making allies of certain alien factions sympathetic to the player&#x27;s cause, the player could take the fight to his or her captors. Searching further within this immense ship, the player would discover a chamber filled with metal cocoons. Using wits and the knowledge gained through other locations, the controls for the cocoons could be manipulated to discover what was contained within. It would be revealed that these cocoons hold bodies, the bodies of all of those captured. The machines keep the bodies physically alive and fit, but imprisoned. The minds of those entrapped are tapped and fed with images (à la &quot;The Matrix&quot;, only years earlier).

The ship&#x27;s computer can even permit the images to interact with solid/material components of the ship. The player would learn that his or her own body was itself just an image, with the actual body lying in a cocoon. The question of the nature of reality would be raised, leading to questions such as what is a soul, or what is experience. The player has experienced the entire ordeal through the illusionary image ever since the kidnapping.

In the end, the player would be left with many choices. One could continue to live on as the image body, a nearly immortal life, but knowing that these aliens have done this and can watch, feel, and experience whatever is done. In essence, the player is their entertainment. They have become jaded by luxury, power and knowledge and use lesser beings to regain some of the passions of life. Hence, one could instead cut off this channel, though the alien beings may destroy the ship, or even Earth itself. One could escape in a smaller ship (as compared to the massive &quot;Alternate Reality&quot; entertainment world) and go back to Earth. One could even destroy the planet, or bring it back to Earth to let scientists learn from it. There would be many choices (including selling out humanity), but these would be the decisions the player would have to make at the end of the journey.

==Technology==
&quot;AR&quot; worked from a 3D first-person perspective, with a small window taking up about 1/9 of the screen at the center. The player controlled one character who had an absolute minimum of visual representationthe closest to a character image to be found was when one encountered a &quot;doppelganger&quot; monster. The 3D used was not like other contemporary 3D graphics either. Most other 3D first-person games used static graphics to represent the walls, meaning the player could only move one tile at a time. In this game however the rate of travel depended on the character&#x27;s speed, and moved incrementally along the tile. Distant walls would slowly come in to focus rather than suddenly appear.

&quot;Alternate Reality&quot; has a raycasting engine similar to &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;, which came seven years later, but was recognized for popularizing the system. The design implemented right-angle movement only. While the sun is setting, the entire palette of colors changes convincingly. Distant waterfalls move, and the rain is rendered.

The first game, &quot;The City&quot;, uses a novel anti-copying technique. The program disks could be copied through the standard methods and the copy would appear to work, but not long after the player began the game, in the Atari version their character would become weaker and weaker and then die from an apparent disease. On the Apple II and Macintosh versions, repeated &quot;random&quot; encounters would occur in quick succession when wandering the town, and escaping the combat was disabled. Eventually, the character would be defeated and die. The Dungeon, if loaded with an unauthorized copy, featured two &quot;FBI agents&quot; as encounters during the beginning of the game, who attacked with &quot;the long arm of the law&quot;. The two agents were overly powerful and unbeatable, so as to kill the character before being able to play the game. Due to a bug, the other way to run into these characters was to try to transfer over a character from the city. In effect, it was impossible to actually transfer a character over from the city to the dungeon without mailing in the disks to be exchanged for a fixed version.

==Gameplay==
Character statistics (strength, intelligence, charisma, etc.) are displayed at the top of the screen. Some stats remain hidden from the player. For example, the player is not made aware of their character&#x27;s alignment (good/evil/neutral). The player comes to learn their alignment through how other characters treated them in the game. Potions, poison, drunkenness, and disease, may also alter the player&#x27;s statstemporarily or permanently. The player has to keep track of their character&#x27;s hunger, thirst, fatigue, comfort (hot or cold), and how encumbered the character is. While food and water can be carried, supplies are limited and the player will have to find or purchase new packets. The character can only sleep in an inn, so if the player was off adventuring and the character started to get hungry and tired, they would have to return to a safe area before the player could fulfill these needs.

Due to budget constraints, the first game was released, essentially, without a plot. Only in the second installment were any elements of a traditional RPG plot added in, but the player could (and probably did) spend days playing before realizing the importance of any of their actions.

The bottom of the screen alternated depending on user choice and situation between consumables like food, water, money, and torches, equipment, combat options, spells, and other things. The sides held the compass at left (when the player had one) and directional arrows at right.

The gameplay of both games is reminiscent of other RPGs but more sophisticated than its peerswhile the player wandered around gaining levels and equipment, there were things like a finite number of items in the world, and items stolen could be regained. Near overflows of memory from possessing too many items resulted in an encounter with The Devourer, a fearsome creature that sucked items from the player, and thus removed them from memory. Death was permissible and mostly uncheatable since the game cleverly marked the character as dead as soon as the user started and only let the character to become &quot;alive&quot; once they saved. It was possible to &quot;revive&quot; a lost character, but it caused a loss in one of the character&#x27;s stats.

==Ports==
The games in the &quot;Alternate Reality&quot; series were developed on the Atari 8-bit home computers, but were ported to other platforms as well.

==Reception==
In 1993, Scorpia called &quot;The City&quot; &quot;a fascinating premise that turned out rather poorly ... a game for those with great persistence and patience&quot;, and &quot;The Dungeon&quot; &quot;better than the first, but not by much&quot;.

&quot;Alternate Reality: The City&quot; and &quot;Alternate Reality: The Dungeon&quot; were both the subject of the feature review &quot;Dragon&quot; #135. The reviewers gave &quot;AR: The City&quot; 3 stars, and &quot;AR: The Dungeon&quot; stars.

&quot;Alternate Reality: The City&quot; was reviewed in Computer Gamer #12 and got a value for money rating of 5/5. It was also reviewed in &quot;Casus Belli&quot; #33 (June 1986).

<text>Jai alai ( : ) is a Basque sport involving bouncing a ball off a walled-in space by accelerating it to high speeds with a hand-held wicker, commonly referred to as a &quot;cesta&quot;. It is a variation of Basque pelota. The term &quot;jai alai&quot;, coined by Serafin Baroja in 1875, is also often loosely applied to the fronton (the open-walled playing area) where matches take place. The game, whose name means &quot;merry festival&quot; in Basque, is called &quot;zesta-punta&quot; (&quot;basket tip&quot;) in the Basque Country. The sport is played worldwide, but especially in Spain, France, the U.S. state of Florida, and Baja California.

== Rules and customs ==
The court for jai alai consists of walls on the front, back and left, and the floor between them. If the ball (called a &quot;pelota&quot; in Spanish, &quot;pilota&quot; in Standard Basque) touches the floor outside these walls, it is considered out of bounds. Similarly, there is also a border on the lower of the front wall that is also out of bounds. The ceiling on the court is usually very high, so the ball has a more predictable path. The court is divided by 14 parallel lines going horizontally across the court, with line 1 closest to the front wall and line 14 the back wall. In doubles, each team consists of a frontcourt player and a backcourt player. The game begins when the frontcourt player of the first team serves the ball to the second team. The winner of each point stays on the court to meet the next team in rotation. Losers go to the end of the line to await another turn on the court. The first team to score 7 points (or 9 in Superfecta games) wins. The next highest scores are awarded &quot;place&quot; (second) and &quot;show&quot; (third) positions, respectively. Playoffs decide tied scores.

The most common American version of the game of jai alai game is played in round robin format, usually between eight teams of two players each or eight single players, although in rare instances the teams may consist of three players each or triples. The first team to score 7 or 9 points wins the game. Two of the eight teams are in the court for each point. The server on one team must bounce the ball behind the serving line, then with the cesta &quot;basket&quot; hurl it towards the front wall so it strikes the front wall first and if it is not caught by the other team before it bounces, must
bounce between lines 4 and 7 on the floor. The ball is then in play. The ball used in jai alai is hand crafted and consists of wound virgin rubber strands tightly wound together and then wrapped in 2 layers of goat skin. Once the ball is in play, the other team must catch and return it before it bounces twice. The process of catching and throwing must be completed in one fluid motion with no &quot;juggling&quot; or &quot;holding&quot; of the ball. The ball may be caught either on the fly or after bouncing once on the floor but cannot bounce twice. A team scores a point if an opposing player:

* fails to serve the ball directly to the front wall so that upon rebound it will bounce between lines No. 4 and 7. If it does not, it is an under or over serve and the other team will receive the point.
* fails to catch the ball on the fly or after one bounce
* holds or juggles the ball
* hurls the ball out of bounds
* interferes with a player attempting to catch and hurl the ball. These interference plays are called at the judges&#x27; discretion and most times, the point is replayed.
The team scoring a point remains in the court and the opposing team rotates off the court to the end of the list of opponents. Points usually double after the first round of play, once each team has played at least one point. When a game is played with points doubling after the first round, this is called &quot;Spectacular Seven&quot; or &quot;Spectacular Nine&quot; scoring if the games are played to nine points.

The players frequently attempt a &quot;chula&quot; shot, where the ball is played off the front wall then reaches the bottom of the back wall by the end of its arc. The &quot;chula&quot; is when the ball rebounds low off the back wall with very little to no bounce, almost rolling along
the floor.

Since there is no wall on the right side, all jai alai players must play right-handed (wear the cesta on their right hand), as the spin of a left-handed throw would give a tremendous advantage to the left handed player due to the incredible amount of spin.

The Basque government promotes &quot;jai alai&quot; as &quot;the fastest sport in the world&quot; because of the speed of the ball. The sport once held the world record for ball speed with a 125–140 g ball covered with goatskin that traveled at , performed by José Ramón Areitio at the Newport, Rhode Island Jai Alai, until it was broken by Canadian 5-time long drive champion Jason Zuback on a 2007 episode of &quot;Sport Science&quot; with a golf ball speed of .

The sport can be dangerous, as the ball travels at high velocities. It has led to injuries that caused players to retire and fatalities have been recorded in some cases.

== Industry ==

Jai alai is a popular sport within the Latin American countries and the Philippines due to its Hispanic influence. It was one of the two gambling sports from Europe, the other being horse racing, in the semi-colonial Chinese cities of Shanghai and Tianjin, and was shut down after the communist victory there. The jai alai arena in Tianjin&#x27;s former Italian Concession was then confiscated and turned into a recreation center for the city&#x27;s working class.

===The Philippines===
Jai alai was played in Manila at the Manila Jai Alai Building, one of the most significant Art Deco buildings in Asia that was demolished in 2000 by the Manila city government. In 1986, &quot;jai alai&quot; was prohibited nationwide from problems with game fixing. However, the game returned to the country once again in March 2010 in the province of Pangasinan albeit was briefly paused in 2011 caused by a blanket restriction on non-traditional sports abetted by a Chinese lottery jueteng but was lifted immediately. Nowadays, Jai alai is played strictly as a competitive and entertainment sport at the Casino Español de Manila.

===United States===
In the United States, jai alai enjoyed some popularity as a gambling alternative to horse racing, greyhound racing, and harness racing, and was particularly popular in Florida and Connecticut, where the game was used as a basis for parimutuel betting.

The first jai alai fronton in the United States was located in St. Louis, Missouri, operating around the time of the 1904 World&#x27;s Fair. 

From 1988–1991, the &quot;International Jai-Alai Players Association&quot; held the longest strike in American professional sport. After the 1988 season, the players, 90% of them Basque, returned home and threatened not to come back unless the owners improved their work conditions. Spain was no longer a poor conservative country and the new generation of players were influenced by leftist Basque nationalism. The owners, however, offered the same terms and substituted with inexperienced locals, while the world-class stars picketed the courts for years. The public did not notice the change. The strike ended with an agreement, and later strikes were placated with salary rises. Meanwhile, Native American casinos and state lotteries had appeared as an alternative to jai-alai betting.

==== Florida ====
The first fronton in Florida opened at the site of Hialeah Race Course near Miami in 1924. The fronton was relocated to its present site in Miami near Miami International Airport. The Miami Jai-Alai Fronton was the biggest in the world with a record audience of 15,502 people on 27 December 1975. 

Besides the fronton in Miami, there were at one at least 10 other jai alai frontons in the state. 

The Tampa Jai Alai fronton opened in 1952 and operated until 1998. It was located on South Dale Mabry Highway on land that now hosts a Home Depot. The seating capacity of the fronton was around 4,000. 

Dania Jai Alai phased out professional jai alai in November 2021. It has a &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; that documents the best front- and back-court players. 

Jai-alai was also played at Palm Beach Jai-Alai in West Palm Beach, Orlando Jai-Alai in Casselberry, Daytona Jai-Alai at the Daytona Intl. Speedway, and Big Bend Jai-Alai in Quincy.

It was played seasonally at Fort Pierce Jai-Alai in Fort Pierce, Ocala Jai-Alai in Reddick, and Jasper Jai-Alai in Hamilton.

One Florida fronton, in Melbourne, was converted from jai alai to greyhound racing, although it later closed.

In an effort to prevent the closure of frontons in Florida, the Florida State Legislature passed HB 1059, a bill that changed the rules regarding the operation and wagering of poker in a parimutuel facility such as a jai alai fronton and a greyhound and horseracing track. The bill became law on August 6, 2003. 

===== Present status =====
In the mid-to-late 20th century, games could draw 5,000 spectators, a figure that fell to as few as 50 by 2017.

Today, only two frontons remain open in the state. One is operated by Jai Alai World at the Magic City Casino northwest of downtown Miami. The fronton offers two kinds of games: the traditional parimutuel game, in which eight contestants compete for win, place and show finishes; and &quot;battle court,&quot; in which players participate in singles and doubles matches, akin to tennis, and accumulate points as in a dual meet. Matches are played with rubber balls and streamed online from the Jai Alai World website. Jai Alai World also host special jai alai events include the U.S. Jai Alai Championship and World Super Court.

In 2022, BetRivers became a sponsor and began taking wagers from users outside Florida. 

The second operational fronton is located at The Casino @ Dania Beach will commence its next session of jai alai on November 29, 2024, with the Third Annual Dania Beach Invitational Tournament.

==== New England ====
Professional Jai-Alai frontons no longer exist in Connecticut and Rhode Island, where they first opened in the 1970s, waning as other gambling options became available. 

In Connecticut, there were frontons in Hartford, Milford, and Bridgeport all of which have permanently closed. The Milford fronton opened in May 1977 and closed in 2001. The fronton at Hartford opened in the summer of 1976 and closed in 1995 The Bridgeport fronton opened in 1976 and ended jai alai in 1995. It was converted to a greyhound race track, which struggled financially, and closed in 2005.

The fronton at Newport Jai Alai in Newport, Rhode Island was built on the site of the city dump, opening in May 1976. Jai-alai playing ended in 2003 at which point the facility was converted into Newport Grand, a slot machine and video lottery terminal parlor, which closed permanently in August 2018.

==== Las Vegas ====
Jai alai enjoyed a brief and popular stint in Las Vegas with the opening of a fronton at the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino; however, by the early 1980s, the fronton was losing money and was closed by MGM Grand owner Kirk Kerkorian. The MGM Grand in Reno also showcased jai alai for a very short period (1978–1980).

==== Amateur jai-alai====
During the late 1960s, in addition to North Miami Amateur, at least one other amateur court from International Amateur Jai-Alai in South Miami professional players emerged at World Jai-Alai, regarded as the first American pelotari who turned pro in 1968 and enjoyed a lengthy career. In the 1970s and early 1980s, Orbea&#x27;s Jai-Alai in Hialeah featured four indoor courts. Two of the courts played with hard rubber balls (&quot;pelota de goma&quot;) were shorter than a standard court (, respectively) and used for training players and amateur leagues. In addition, two courts were played with the regulation pelota (hardball / &quot;pelota dura&quot;), one short in length () and one regulation length (). Orbea&#x27;s also sold equipment such as cestas and helmets.

The first public amateur jai alai facility was in Milford CT and owned by Charlie Hernandez. Future frontons were built in the United States, including one in 2008 in St. Petersburg, Florida, with the assistance of the city of St. Petersburg and private funding from Jeff Conway (Laca).

In addition to the amateur court in St. Petersburg, The American Jai-Alai Foundation offers lessons. Its president, Victor Valcarce, was a pelotari at Dania Jai-Alai (MAGO) and was considered the best &quot;rubber ball&quot; player in the world. Sponsored in North Miami Beach, Florida which was once owned by World Jai-Alai as a school that, in 1972, produced the greatest American pelotari, Joey Cornblit.

Retired players visited and played as well as highly skilled amateurs, pros from Miami Jai-Alai and various other professional frontons operating at the time. The additions of the South Miami, North Miami, Orbea, and, later, the Milford amateur courts are generally considered to be the golden age of the amateur jai-alai player and the sport in the United States. In the late 1980s, at least one other amateur court was constructed in Connecticut.

<text>David Frawley is an American Hindutva activist and a teacher of Hinduism. 

He has written numerous books on topics spanning the Vedas, Hinduism, yoga, ayurveda and Hindu astrology. In 2015 he was honored by the government of India with the Padma Bhushan, the third-highest civilian award in India.

A prominent ideologue of the Hindutva movement, he has also been accused of practicing historical revisionism.

== Early life and education ==
David Frawley was born to a Catholic family in Wisconsin and had nine siblings. Frawley is largely an autodidact. He studied ayurveda under B. L. Vashta of Mumbai for a span of about a decade, and obtained a &quot;Doctor of Oriental Medicine&quot; degree via a correspondence course from the International Institute of Chinese Medicine, Santa Fe, New Mexico, a school for acupuncture which closed in 2003 due to &quot;administrative and governance irregularities&quot; and financial problems.&quot;

Frawley is the founder and the sole instructor at the American Institute of Vedic Studies at Santa Fe, New Mexico and is a former president of the American Council of Vedic Astrology. He also previously taught Chinese herbal medicine and western herbology.

== Views and reception ==

=== Views ===
Frawley rejects the Indo-Aryan migration theory in favor of the Indigenous Aryans theory, accusing his opponents of having a “European missionary bias”. In the book &quot;In Search of the Cradle of Civilization&quot; (1995), Frawley along with Georg Feuerstein and Subhash Kak has rejected the widely supported Indo-Aryan migration, rhetorically calling it the Aryan Invasion Theory, an outdated and inaccurate term, and supported the Indigenous Aryans theory. Frawley also criticizes the 19th-century racial interpretations of Indian prehistory, and went on to reject the theory of a conflict between invading caucasoid Aryans and Dravidians.

In the sphere of market-economics, Frawley opposes socialism, stating that such policies have reduced citizens to beggars. He is a practitioner of Ayurveda, and recommends the practice of ascetic rituals along with moral purification as indispensable parts of the Advaita tradition.

===Reception===

====Popular reception====
While being rejected by academia, he has been successful in the popular market; according to Bryant, his works are clearly directed and articulated at such audiences. He&#x27;s been a prominent voice in the introduction of Ayurvedic medicine and Vedic astrology among a western, nonmedical trained audience. According to Edwin Bryant, he is &quot;well-received&quot; by &quot;the Indian community,&quot; noting that a Westerner rejecting the Aryan Migration Theory has an obvious appeal in India and Frawley (along with Koenraad Elst) fits in it, perfectly. Frawley commands a significant following on Twitter, as well.

==== Academia ====

=====Hindutva=====
He has been described as a prominent figure of the Hindutva movement and numerous scholars have also described him as a Hindutva ideologue and apologist. He has been widely described as practicing historical revisionism. Martha Nussbaum and others consider him to be the most determined opponent to the theory of Indo-Aryan migrations.

Meera Nanda asserts Frawley to be a member of the Hindu far right, who decries Islam and Christianity as religions for the lower intellects and whose works feature a Hindu Supremacist spin. Sudeshna Guha of Cambridge University notes him to be a sectarian non-scholar and as a proponent of a broader scheme for establishing a nationalist history. Irfan Habib rejected considering Frawley as a scholar, and instead, noted him to be a Hindutva pamphleteer, who &quot;telescoped the past to serve the present&quot; and was not minimally suitable of being defined as a scholar, of any kind. Bryant notes him to be an unambiguously pro-Hindu scholar. Peter Heehs deems of him to be part of a group of reactionary orientalists, who professed an avid dislike for the Oriental-Marxist school of historiography and hence, chose to rewrite the history of India &quot;but&quot; without any training in relevant disciplines; he also accused Frawley of misappropriating Aurobindo&#x27;s nuanced stance on the Indigenous Aryans hypothesis.

Bruce Lincoln attributes Frawley&#x27;s ideas to &quot;parochial nationalism&quot;, terming them &quot;exercises in scholarship (= myth + footnotes)&quot;, where archaeological data spanning several millennia is selectively invoked, with no textual sources to control the inquiry, in support of the theorists&#x27; desired narrative. His proposed equivalence of Ayurveda with vedic healing traditions has been rejected by Indologists and David Hardiman considers Frawley&#x27;s assertion to be part of a wider Hindu-nationalist quest. Joseph Alter notes that his writings &#x27;play into the politics of nationalism&#x27; and remarks of them to be controversial from an academic locus.

===== Book reviews =====
In a review of &quot;Hymns from the Golden Age: Selected Hymns from the Rig Veda with Yogic Interpretation&quot; for the &quot;Journal of the American Oriental Society&quot;, Richard G. Salomon criticized Frawley&#x27;s &quot;fanciful&quot; approach to stand in complete contrast to the available linguistic and scholarly evidence, and perpetuated Vedic myths in what seemed to be a bid to attract readers for the recreation of the ancient spiritual kingdom of the Aryans.

A review by M. K. Dhavalikar in &quot;Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute&quot; called &quot;In Search of the Cradle of Civilization&quot; a &quot;beautifully printed&quot; contribution that made a strong case for their indigenous theory against the supposed migratory hypotheses but chose to remain silent on certain crucial aspects which need to be convincingly explained. Prema Kurien noted that the book sought to distinguish expatriate Hindu Americans from other minority groups by demonstrating their superior racial and cultural ties with the Europeans.

Dhavalikar also reviewed &quot;The Myth of the Aryan Invasion of India&quot; and found it to be unsupported by archaeological evidence. Irfan Habib criticized Frawley&#x27;s invoking the Sarasvati River in the book as an assault against common sense.

== Honors and influences ==
In 2015, the South Indian Education Society (SIES) in Mumbai, India, an affiliate of Kanchi Kamakoti Peetham, conferred upon him their special &quot;National Eminence Award&quot; as an “international expert in the fields of Ayurveda, Yoga, and Vedic Astrology.” On 26 January 2015, the Indian Government honored Frawley with the Padma Bhushan award.

Referring to his book &quot;Yoga and Ayurveda&quot;, Frawley is mentioned as one of the main yoga teachers of Deepak Chopra and David Simon in their book, the &quot;Seven Spiritual Laws of Yoga&quot; (2005). In 2015, Chopra said of Frawley&#x27;s book, &quot;Shiva, the Lord of Yoga&quot;, &quot;Vamadeva Shastri has been a spiritual guide and mentor of mine for several decades. For anyone who is serious about the journey to higher divine consciousness, this book is yet another jewel from him.&quot;
