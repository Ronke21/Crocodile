<text>Iñaki Urdangarin Liebaert (born 15 January 1968) is a retired Spanish handball player turned entrepreneur and the former husband of Infanta Cristina, younger daughter of King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofía. He was the brother-in-law of King Felipe VI. Urdangarin was convicted in the so-called Nóos case for embezzling about 6 million euros in public funds for sporting events through his nonprofit foundation beginning in 2004, and for political corruption by misusing his former courtesy title of consort Duke of Palma de Mallorca as the husband of Infanta Cristina. In June 2018 he was sentenced to 5 years and 10 months in prison; he was initially imprisoned in Ávila, but as of 2021 he was on supervised release.

==Early life and education==
Iñaki Urdangarin was born on 15 January 1968 in the town of Zumárraga, in Gipuzkoa province, within the autonomous community of Basque country in northern Spain. Urdangarin&#x27;s father, Juan María Urdangarin Berriochoa, also born in Zumarraga, was an engineer and businessman in the chemical and the banking industries. Urdangarin&#x27;s mother, Claire Françoise Liebaert Courtain, was born in Antwerp, Belgium and was of Spanish Basque and Belgian (both Walloon and Flemish) descent.

He has six siblings. His paternal grandparents Laureano de Urdangarin y Larrañaga (1898–1982) and wife Ana de Berriochoa y Elgarresta (1902–1996) came from the tiny and humble Basque village of Zumarraga.

He obtained an MBA after a &quot;tailor made study&quot;.

==Sports career==
At the age of 18, Urdangarin became a professional handball player with FC Barcelona Handbol, where he remained until his retirement in 2000. Meanwhile, he studied at the Escuela Superior de Administración y Dirección de Empresas (ESADE) in Barcelona, from which he received a master&#x27;s degree in business administration.

As a member of the Spanish handball team, he participated in the 1992, 1996, and 2000 Summer Olympics, serving as team captain in 2000. The team won the bronze medal in 1996 and 2000.

Urdangarin has been a member of the Spanish Olympic Committee since 4 April 2001, and was elected first deputy chairman on 16 February 2004. In 2001, he received the Grand Cross of the Royal Order of Sports Merit.

In September 2001, it was reported that Urdangarin had been appointed director of planning and development at Octagon Esedos, a company dedicated to sports marketing. At the same time, he retired from professional handball.

==Corruption and money laundering==

In November 2011, Urdangarin was accused of diverting public funds for his own profit through the non-profit &quot;Nóos institute&quot; in the &#x27;Palma Arena&#x27; case. The Spanish Anticorruption bureau conducted searches at the &quot;Nóos institute&quot;. The daily &quot;El País&quot; published a budget document for an international event organized by the Noos Institute. It is believed that he persuaded various Spanish public administrations (mostly regional governments) to sign agreements with the Nóos Institute for both work that was never done and work that was dramatically overstated, amounting to up to €5,800,000 of funding from public administrations.

In December 2011, the Anticorruption Bureau confirmed that Urdangarin had been sending substantial sums of public money to accounts in Belize and the United Kingdom. That same month, the Royal Household of Spain announced that Urdangarin would not participate in any official royal family activity for the foreseeable future, as a result of the scandal. In his 2011 Christmas Eve National Speech, King Juan Carlos stated that &quot;La justicia es igual para todos&quot; (&quot;Justice is the same for everyone&quot;); the following day he clarified that he was speaking generally.

On 6 February 2012, Urdangarin appeared before a judge regarding allegations of corruption. He was investigated with 14 others, including Jaume Matas, former premier of the Balearics. He appeared again on 25 February 2012 in Mallorca to answer questions before the investigating judge, José Castro.

On 26 January 2013, the Spanish royal household removed from its official website the section covering Iñaki Urdangarin.

On 10 June 2016 Prosecutor Pedro Horrach called for Urdangarin to be jailed for years and to be fined 980,000 euros. He was sentenced to six years and three months of jail and a fine of €512,000 on 17 February 2017. On 12 June 2018, the Supreme Court of Spain in appeal sentenced Urdangarin to five years and ten months imprisonment. On 18 June 2018, he reported to the prison of Brieva in Ávila. In 2021, he was put on supervised release, needing to visit prison only once a week.

==Personal life==
According to the Royal Household, Urdangarin met the Infanta Cristina, Duchess of Palma de Mallorca at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta. However Consuelo León Llorente and María Molina maintain in their book, &quot;Infanta Cristina&quot;, that they met in 1992. They married in Barcelona on 4 October 1997. The couple have four children, all born at Teknon Medical Centre in Barcelona: Juan (born 29 September 1999); Pablo (born 6 December 2000); Miguel (born 30 April 2002); and Irene (born 5 June 2005). As is social custom in Spain, Urdangarin had often been accorded the male form of his wife&#x27;s title with the courtesy title of Duke of Palma de Mallorca since his marriage. Cristina would lose this title in 2015.

The family lived in Barcelona from 1997 until 2009, where Urdangarin was director of planning and development for Motorpress Ibérica and a founding partner of Nóos Consultoría Estratégica. From 2009 to 2011, they lived in Washington, D.C., where he worked for Telefónica. In August 2013, Urdangarin remained in Barcelona to stand trial, while his wife and children moved to Geneva, Switzerland, to work with the Caixabank Foundation. On 24 January 2022, Cristina and Urdangarin announced their separation. The couple divorced in December 2023.

<doc id="237019" wikidata="Q187326" url="?curid=237019" title="Aberdeen F.C.">
<text>Aberdeen Football Club is a Scottish professional football club based in Aberdeen, Scotland. They compete in the Scottish Premiership and have never been relegated from the top division of the Scottish football league system since they were elected to the top flight in 1905. Aberdeen have won four Scottish league titles, seven Scottish Cups and six Scottish League Cups. They are also the only Scottish team to have won two European trophies, having won the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup and the European Super Cup in 1983.

Formed in 1903 as a result of the amalgamation of three clubs from Aberdeen, they rarely challenged for honours until the post-war decade, when they won each of the major Scottish trophies under manager Dave Halliday. This level of success was surpassed in the 1980s, when, under the management of Alex Ferguson, they won three league titles, four Scottish Cups and a Scottish League Cup, alongside the two European trophies. Aberdeen were the last club outside the Old Firm to win a league title, in 1984–85, and also the last Scottish team to win a European trophy. The team has enjoyed less success since this golden era, though a 19-year wait for a major trophy was ended by winning the 2013–14 Scottish League Cup, followed up by multiple second-place finishes behind Celtic in the league during the 2010s.

Aberdeen have played at Pittodrie Stadium since their inception. The ground currently has a capacity of and was the first all-seated and all-covered stadium in the United Kingdom. Pittodrie was also the first football stadium to feature a dug-out, an invention of player and coach Donald Colman.

The club&#x27;s colours have been primarily red and white since 1939; before this, they played in black and gold vertical stripes. In modern times, Aberdeen have almost exclusively played with all-red strips with white detailing. Aberdeen attract support from the city and surrounding areas, as they have no geographically close rivals. Lacking a local competitor, Aberdeen have instead developed rivalries with more distant opponents such as Dundee United (collectively known as the &quot;New Firm&quot; in the 1980s) and Rangers.

== History ==

=== Formation and early years (1903–1939) ===

The current Aberdeen F.C. was formed following the merger of three clubs based in the city—Aberdeen, Victoria United and Orion—in 1903. The new club played its first match on 15 August 1903: a 1–1 draw with Stenhousemuir. That first season produced a win in the Aberdeenshire Cup, but only a third-place finish in the Northern League. The club applied for membership of the Scottish League for the following season, and were elected to the Second Division.

In 1904, the club were managed by Jimmy Philip. At the end of its first season, despite having finished seventh out of twelve teams, Aberdeen were elected to the new, expanded First Division. They have remained in the top tier of Scottish football ever since. From 1906, the club made steady progress, with a Scottish Cup semi-final appearance in 1908 and another in 1911. In that season of 1910–11, Aberdeen recorded their first victories over the Old Firm of Celtic and Rangers, and led the league for a time, but finished the season in second place.

Wartime affected the club as much as any other; despite spending cuts and other economies, by 1917 the situation became untenable. Aberdeen dropped out of competitive football, along with Dundee and Raith Rovers. Senior football returned on 16 August 1919, and Aberdeen resumed with a fixture against Albion Rovers. Philip was still in charge, and continued to oversee a team capable of isolated good results, but never quite able to sustain a challenge long enough to win a trophy. In 1923, Aberdeen were drawn against Peterhead in the Scottish Cup, and posted their record score—a 13–0 victory. Philip retired a year later, and was replaced as manager by Paddy Travers. He presided over the team&#x27;s first Scottish Cup final in 1937.

Travers&#x27; &quot;trainer&quot;—first team coach in modern parlance—was former player Donald Colman. Colman conceived the dug-out, a covered area set slightly below the level of the playing surface to better aid his observations. Everton visited Pittodrie soon after its introduction, and exported the idea to the English leagues, from where it spread throughout the football-playing world. Travers left to become manager of Clyde in 1939.

=== Halliday to McNeill (1939–1978) ===

Travers was replaced by former Yeovil Town manager Dave Halliday, one of more than a hundred applicants for the role, and the club moved from their black and gold strip to red and white. Halliday had barely begun his work when World War II halted competitive football in the United Kingdom. For these six years, the club was temporarily taken over by then-directors Charles B Forbes and George Anderson while Halliday served in the war.

Halliday&#x27;s place in the Aberdeen Hall of Fame was secured after the war when he became the first manager to bring national trophies to Pittodrie. Aberdeen won the Southern League Cup in the 1945–46 season, defeating Rangers 3–2 at Hampden. They then reached the 1947 Scottish Cup final, defeating Hibernian 2–1 with George Hamilton, signed from Halliday&#x27;s former club Queen of the South, scoring to gain the club&#x27;s first major trophy. From this early success, Halliday&#x27;s side reached two more Scottish Cup finals, in 1953 and 1954, though they lost both. Halliday&#x27;s team were not to be denied, however, and the following season, 1954–55, Aberdeen won their first Scottish League title. Though league winners, the club did not participate in the first European Cup competition—Scotland&#x27;s place was awarded to Hibernian, who took part by special invitation.

Halliday and Hamilton left at the end of that championship-winning season, and Halliday was replaced by Davie Shaw. Aberdeen won the League Cup under his guidance, beating St Mirren in 1955–56, and reached another Scottish Cup final in 1959. However, Shaw stepped aside for another former favourite player, Tommy Pearson, in 1959. Pearson&#x27;s time in charge coincided with a high turnover of players, and yielded no trophies. He retired in 1965, making way for Eddie Turnbull.

Turnbull led Aberdeen to the 1967 Scottish Cup final, where the side was ultimately defeated by Celtic. Despite this loss, Aberdeen qualified for the European Cup Winner&#x27;s Cup in the following season thanks to their appearance in this final, the first time the club had competed in European competition. Their first tie was a 14–1 aggregate victory over KR Reykjavik, although they lost the second round tie with Standard Liège 3–2 on aggregate. Two years later, Derek &quot;Cup-tie&quot; McKay recorded the only four goals of his Aberdeen career to help his team to the 1969–70 Scottish Cup, scoring the winning goals in the quarter- and semi final, and two in the final itself. As Scottish Cup holders, Aberdeen once again qualified for the same competition, but were eliminated in the first round following a 4–4 aggregate tie with Honvéd. This tie, level after extra time and also level on away goals, was decided by the first penalty shoot-out in UEFA competition history, Honvéd winning the shootout 5–4 in Budapest.

The Aberdeen side of the 1970s regularly challenged for domestic honours. However, they rarely won trophies, with the exception of the Drybrough Cup in 1971 under Jimmy Bonthrone and the League Cup in 1976, under Ally MacLeod. During this decade, Aberdeen had five managers: Eddie Turnbull, Jimmy Bonthrone, Ally MacLeod, Billy McNeill and Alex Ferguson. They reached two more national cup finals—the Scottish Cup in 1978 under Billy McNeill and the League Cup in the following season under the new manager Alex Ferguson.

=== Alex Ferguson era (1978–1986) ===

Under Ferguson&#x27;s guidance, the club won three league championships, four Scottish Cups, one League Cup, the European Cup Winner&#x27;s Cup, the European Super Cup and a Drybrough Cup—all in the space of seven years. Players such as Jim Leighton, Willie Miller, Alex McLeish and Gordon Strachan became the backbone of the team. Aberdeen&#x27;s second League title was won in 1979–80 and this initial success was built upon with Scottish Cup wins in three successive seasons from 1982 to 1984, and two more league titles in 1983–84 and 1984–85.During the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1983, Aberdeen beat FC Sion, Dinamo Tirana and Lech Poznań to face the German Cup winners Bayern Munich. This game was won 3–2 at Pittodrie after a goalless draw in Germany, John Hewitt with the winning goal. They then faced now-defunct Belgian club Waterschei in the semi-final. Aberdeen beat them 5–1 at home, and lost for the first time in the tournament, 1–0 away, resulting in an aggregate victory which sent Aberdeen to the final. On 11 May 1983, Aberdeen beat Real Madrid 2–1 after extra time to win the cup and become only the third Scottish side to win a European trophy. The club released a song, &quot;European Song&quot;, to coincide with the appearance in the final. This was followed up with the capture of the European Super Cup in December, when Hamburger SV were beaten over two legs.
Aberdeen reached the semi-finals of the 1983–84 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, before losing to Porto 2–0 on aggregate. In the first round of the 1984–85 European Champion Club&#x27;s Cup Aberdeen lost to East Berlin side BFC Dynamo in a penalty shoot-out 4–5, following a 3–3 on aggregate in regular times. Today, both clubs enjoy friendly relations.

=== Post-Ferguson (1987–1999) ===
After Ferguson moved to England to manage Manchester United in November 1986, Aberdeen struggled to compete with Celtic and a resurgent Rangers.

Aberdeen signed new co-managers in 1989, pairing Alex Smith and Jocky Scott. A number of foreign players were signed, including Dutch internationals Theo Snelders and Hans Gillhaus. In the 1989–90 season, the club won both the Scottish Cup and the Scottish League Cup. In 1991, they lost the last game of the season, and the league title, to Rangers. Former player Willie Miller took over in 1992 and presided over two seasons where Aberdeen came close to winning the title. However, the club ended the 1994–95 season second-bottom, and had to rely on a play-off victory over Dunfermline Athletic to retain their Premier Division status. Miller was sacked in February 1995, and replaced by Roy Aitken. Despite a Scottish League Cup success in 1995, the club continued to struggle. Alex Miller and Paul Hegarty had spells in charge in the late 1990s, but with the financial burden of a new stand putting the club into debt for the first time in its history, the directors turned to Stewart Milne, a local businessman whose firm had built the stand, hiring him as the club&#x27;s chairman.

=== Skovdahl to Brown (1999–2013) ===

Aberdeen&#x27;s first foreign manager, Ebbe Skovdahl, was appointed in 1999 and his time in charge coincided with some of the heaviest defeats in the club&#x27;s history. The low point of the club&#x27;s history came in the 1999–2000 season, where they finished bottom of the table. As the Scottish Premier League (SPL) was being expanded to twelve teams, Aberdeen were due to take part in a three team play-off with the teams that finished second and third in the First Division. The play-off never happened though, as one of those clubs (Falkirk) did not meet SPL stadium requirements, and Aberdeen retained their top flight status. This was followed by an early-season defeat to Irish club Bohemians on the away goals rule in the next season&#x27;s UEFA Cup.

Steve Paterson was appointed to replace Skovdahl following his resignation in 2002, but lasted only two seasons. Paterson&#x27;s tenure with Aberdeen was marred by his addiction to alcohol. In March 2003 he failed to attend a home game against Dundee due to being too hungover after a night of drinking prior to the match.

Jimmy Calderwood took over in 2004 and Aberdeen posted more consistent results than in previous seasons. In the 2006–07 season, the club finished in third place in the league and entered the final qualifying round for the 2007–08 UEFA Cup. Aberdeen defeated Dnipro on the away goals rule to progress (the first time Aberdeen had won on away goals in European football for 40 years). They went on to beat F.C. Copenhagen 4–0, which was the biggest margin of victory and one of Pittodrie&#x27;s biggest crowds since the 1980s. This set up a meeting with German giants Bayern Munich, which they lost 7–3 on aggregate after a 2–2 draw which saw Aberdeen lead twice in the first leg. Calderwood was sacked by Aberdeen on 24 May 2009, hours after he took the club to a fourth-place finish and back into Europe. Poor domestic cup performances were thought to be the reason for Calderwood&#x27;s dismissal.

Mark McGhee of Motherwell was appointed as Calderwood&#x27;s replacement in June 2009. McGhee controversially dismissed Aberdeen legend and goalkeeping coach Jim Leighton in August 2009 and replaced him with Colin Meldrum. Aberdeen suffered a 9–0 defeat to Celtic on 6 November 2010, their heaviest ever defeat. McGhee and his assistants were eventually sacked in December of that year.

Aberdeen approached Craig Brown, who was working without a contract at Motherwell, to replace McGhee. Brown initially rebuffed an offer, but after further discussions with the club Brown resigned as manager at Motherwell to be announced as the next manager at Aberdeen two days later. The first act of the new management team of Brown and Archie Knox was to re-instate Leighton. Aberdeen failed to produce better results under Craig Brown&#x27;s tenure, and in March 2013 he announced his retirement to take up a non-executive director role on the club&#x27;s board.

=== Recent years (2013–present) ===
Derek McInnes was announced as the successor to Craig Brown in March 2013. In McInnes&#x27; first season as manager, Aberdeen won the 2013–14 Scottish League Cup after defeating Inverness 4–2 on penalties, their first trophy in 19 years. Aberdeen finished third in the Scottish Premiership, and began the next season by coming through the early rounds of the Europa League, beating Dutch club FC Groningen before eventually being eliminated by Spanish side Real Sociedad. The club ended the season in second place—their best league position since 1993–94—in 2015, 2016, and 2017. In recent seasons&#x27; Europa League competitions, they were defeated in the third qualifying round four times: In 2015–16 by FC Kairat, in 2016–17 by NK Maribor, in 2017–18 by Apollon Limassol, and in 2019–20 by HNK Rijeka.

Aberdeen were league runners-up once more in 2016–17 and reached both cup finals, but were beaten 3–0 by Celtic in the League Cup and 2–1 by the same opponents in the Scottish Cup, echoing the outcome in 1992–93 when Aberdeen had finished second to Rangers in all competitions. They were again second the following season, earning a first league win against Celtic away from home for fourteen years in the final game of the season. This qualified them for the 2018–19 UEFA Europa League, where they were defeated after extra time by Premier League side Burnley in the second qualifying round.

In November 2019, Major League Soccer side Atlanta United acquired a less than 10 percent stake in Aberdeen for £2 million (US$2.57 million) as part of a strategic alliance between the two clubs. As part of this deal, vice-chairman Dave Cormack became chairman of the club, replacing Stewart Milne. Atlanta United president Darren Eales also took a seat on Aberdeen&#x27;s board of directors. McInnes left the post of manager in March 2021 after almost eight years in charge.

Over the subsequent three years, Aberdeen went through four managers. Atlanta United 2 manager and former Aberdeen player Stephen Glass replaced McInnes but was dismissed in February 2022; subsequent hire Jim Goodwin was sacked following a surprise defeat to West of Scotland Football League side Darvel in the Scottish Cup and a 6–0 defeat by Hibernian in the same week; and Barry Robson, who become caretaker manager in January 2023 and permanent manager that May, left in January 2024. Neil Warnock briefly served as interim manager. In April 2024, the club announced that Jimmy Thelin would take the role beginning in June 2024.

== Colours and crest ==
For the first season of the club&#x27;s existence, the team played in a predominantly white strip. This is variously reported as all-white, or as white shirts with blue shorts and socks. This colour scheme was the direct descendant of the colours worn by the precursor Aberdeen club, but lasted only one season before being replaced.

For the 1904–05 season, Aberdeen adopted a black and gold striped shirt, which led to the team being nicknamed &quot;the Wasps&quot;. This strip, with only minor variations, was worn until just before the start of the Second World War. The blue shorts lasted until 1911, and then were replaced with white ones. Socks were black with gold trim, either as stripes or as a solid bar at the turndown.
In March 1939, Aberdeen changed the black and gold colours to red and white, reflecting the silver and red colours of the official City of Aberdeen arms. The first red strips were worn with white shorts, with either red or white socks from 1939 until the 1965–66 season. In 1966, Aberdeen adopted red shorts, making the official kit all-red, similar to that of Liverpool, who made a similar change at around the same time. This arrangement has continued to the present day, with several variations in design, in common with most senior clubs as the replica shirt market has expanded. In the late 1970s an Admiral strip featured five vertical white stripes on the left side of the shirt and shorts, and the early 1980s shirts—as worn at the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup final—featured white vertical pinstripes. Later design changes included significant amounts of blue, and a one-season reversion to white shorts, although the all-red scheme returned in 1997.

Shirt sponsorship began in 1987, and the initial shirt sponsor was JVC. Since then, with the club making fewer appearances on the international stage, shirt sponsors have tended to be local to Aberdeen—they have included one of the local commercial radio stations, Northsound, as well as several Aberdeen-based oil service companies. , the current shirt sponsor is TEXO.

Away colours have tended to be either white—often with black shorts—or a combination of yellow and black, referring back to the black and gold strips of the pre-war era, although for a time in the 1970s, Aberdeen sported an all-blue change strip with white socks. For the 2007–08 season, the change strip was all-white, with a third kit of yellow and black halves available if needed for European games, or in the event of a clash involving both red and white.

The club did not have an official crest before 1972, but several variations on the letters AFC had from time to time featured on the shirt, usually in some kind of cursive font. In November 1972, the club unveiled an official crest or logo, designed by Aberdonian graphic designer Donald Addison. The design represented a capital letter &quot;A&quot; as the side view of a football goal, with a ball forming the crossbar of the letter. This ball was crosshatched in such a way as to depict it as being inside the net, signifying the scoring of a goal. The logo was completed by the letters &quot;FC&quot; in smaller type at a level with the ball element. This badge was used on the shirts from around 1978, with no significant alterations until the mid-1980s when the words &quot;Aberdeen Football Club&quot; were added in a circular border, and the date of the club&#x27;s founding, 1903, was added under the goal element. The current version of the crest, which retains these elements in a unified design, was introduced at the start of the 1997–98 season. Two stars signifying the winning of the two European trophies in 1983 were introduced over the badge in the 2005–06 season.

== Stadium ==

Aberdeen have played throughout their existence at Pittodrie Stadium, the name of which comes from the Pictish for &quot;place of manure&quot;. The ground was first used by the original Aberdeen F.C. in 1899, in a 7–1 win over Dumbarton; when they merged with two other teams in 1903, the new club took over the old Aberdeen ground. On 15 August 1903, 8,000 spectators turned up to watch the new Aberdeen draw 1–1 against Stenhousemuir, the first game played at Pittodrie by its amalgamated tenants. The club initially rented the ground, but subsequently bought it in 1920. The stadium currently seats . The record attendance is 45,061, during a Scottish Cup match between Aberdeen and Hearts on 13 March 1954.

The stadium consists of four stands: the Main Stand, which also houses the club offices and players facilities; the Merkland Road Stand, also referred to as the &quot;Red Shed&quot;; the South Stand, which is opposite the main stand and holds the largest number of spectators; and the Richard Donald stand to the east, which was completed in 1993, contains hospitality suites, and is named after former chairman Dick Donald. A quarter of the South Stand is used to accommodate travelling supporters. In 1978, Pittodrie became the first all covered, all-seater stadium in Britain.

=== Training facilities ===
Aberdeen train at Cormack Park, which was opened on 31 October 2019 by former manager Alex Ferguson, who described the development as &quot;up there with the best&quot; that he had seen. As well as being a training centre for the first team, the complex is also home to the Bobby Clark Football Academy and the AFC Community Trust, as well as acting as a community sports hub. The training facilities are named after chairman Dave Cormack, due to the significant financial investment he made to realise the completion of the project.

The complex is made up of a training pavilion, groundsman&#x27;s accommodation, three full-sized training pitches, two floodlit 3G pitches and two grass pitches. There is also flexible outdoor and indoor space that can be used for sporting or recreational purposes. All the pitches are named after club legends, chosen by the fans via an online poll.

Prior to the opening of Cormack Park, the first team trained in a variety of locations around the city, including the local Gordon Barracks, Seaton Park, Aberdeen Sports Village and Countesswells, the playing fields of Robert Gordon&#x27;s College.

=== New Aberdeen Stadium ===

Since 2009, Aberdeen have been examining a move to a new stadium. Plans for a new stadium began when the club indicated that further development of Pittodrie Stadium was not possible due to the age of the ground and the restrictions from surrounding land. Aberdeen City Council approved an initial project in May 2009, to be situated near Loirston Loch in the south of the city, subject to planning permission. In August 2010, a planning application for the new stadium was submitted to the council, which was approved the following February.

The move was delayed by a year in May 2012 due to problems with land ownership, and suffered a serious setback the following August, when the council rejected a joint application by Aberdeen and Cove Rangers to build a community sports centre at nearby Calder Park. Aberdeen announced in November 2014 new plans to instead build training facilities at Balgownie, on land owned by the University of Aberdeen, but the project was ultimately scrapped in the following July.

Plans to develop a new stadium and training facilities near Westhill, close to the newly developed Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route, were announced in May 2016. The new stadium is expected to have a similar capacity to Pittodrie Stadium. Although the project overcame legal challenges from local residents, progress stalled due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Scotland. Alternative designs at the city&#x27;s beachfront close to Pittodrie were released in August 2021.

== Supporters and nicknames ==

=== Supporters ===

Aberdeen&#x27;s supporters, known as the Red Army, are listed in the team squad list as wearing the number 12 shirt.

Aberdeen are the only top-flight team in the third largest city in Scotland, a city which is relatively remote, geographically, from other large population centres, and as a result have a large catchment area of potential supporters. The average attendance in the 2022–23 Scottish Premiership was 15,636.

In the 1980s, a minority of the club&#x27;s supporters had a reputation as one of Britain&#x27;s most prominent casuals groups, the Aberdeen Soccer Casuals. The rise of the Aberdeen Casuals coincided with the most successful period in the club&#x27;s history, and has been chronicled in more than one published account. Whilst numbers have steadily declined with the introduction of Football Banning Orders preventing hooligans from travelling to games, the Aberdeen Casuals still appear at big fixtures often away from home and in the UEFA Europa League. There were clashes at both fixtures against FC Groningen in 2014, as well as 13 arrests after violent clashes with Dundee United fans at a game in December 2015.

=== Rivalries ===
Aberdeen have rarely played in the same division as their geographically closest neighbours (Cove Rangers, Peterhead, Brechin City, Montrose, Arbroath, Elgin City, and Forfar Athletic), so rivalries have tended to come from further afield. Cove Rangers from the same city entered the professional leagues for the first time in 2019, although the Aberdeen derby is yet to occur in a league meeting.

In the early 1980s, owing to the success both domestically and in Europe of Aberdeen and Dundee United, the pair were known as the New Firm. However, Dundee United have their city neighbours Dundee as close rivals, and the antagonism was not always reciprocated to the same degree.

The same situation applies to Aberdeen&#x27;s rivalry with Rangers, in that Rangers have their own much older and well-known Old Firm rivalry with Celtic. Aberdeen&#x27;s rivalry with Rangers arose after a number of incidents in matches between the two clubs in the 1980s, namely Willie Johnston&#x27;s stamp on John McMaster&#x27;s neck in the Scottish League Cup and Neil Simpson&#x27;s tackle on Ian Durrant in 1988, as well as Aberdeen&#x27;s dominance in Scottish football throughout the decade. Manager Alex Ferguson&#x27;s personal history with Rangers also played a role: a boyhood fan and once the club&#x27;s record signing, Ferguson had long believed that Rangers had frozen him out of the club after they discovered his wife was a Roman Catholic. In the 2021 documentary &quot;Sir Alex Ferguson: Never Give In&quot;, he admitted that his remarks after Aberdeen won the 1983 Scottish Cup final (where, despite Aberdeen beating Rangers 1–0, he regarded it as a &quot;disgraceful performance&quot;) were born from a desire to win by a larger margin. There are still often violent clashes between both sets of supporters within and outwith the stadium to this day.

Aberdeen developed a minor rivalry with Inverness Caledonian Thistle since Inverness were first promoted to the SPL in 2004. It is known as the North derby, since Aberdeen and Inverness are the two largest settlements in the north of Scotland.

Aberdeen&#x27;s re-emerged as one of the top teams in Scotland during the 2010s, which increased the rivalry with Celtic both competitively and between supporters. There have been minor incidents at games.

=== Nicknames ===
Aberdeen are known as &quot;The Dons&quot;, a name that has been in use since at least 1913. The origin of this nickname is unclear. One theory is that it derives from the word &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;teacher&quot;, given Aberdeen&#x27;s history as a university town. It may also be a reference to the nearby River Don, or a contraction of &quot;Aberdonians&quot;. Before the popular adoption of &quot;The Dons&quot;, the team were variously known as &quot;The Wasps&quot; or &quot;The Black and Golds&quot;, both names a reference to the yellow and black striped shirts of the time. As with many teams that play in red, Aberdeen may also be called &quot;The Reds&quot;, and are referred to by some supporters as &quot;The Dandy Dons&quot; or &quot;The Dandies&quot;.

Rival clubs occasionally refer to Aberdeen as &quot;The Sheep&quot; and their supporters as &quot;The Sheep Shaggers&quot;. The term was eventually accepted by the club&#x27;s supporters, and fans began chanting &quot;the sheep are &quot; at games. The song was originally sung by away fans poking fun at an Aberdeen fan set on fire on a train while wearing a homemade sheep costume. This in turn led to specialised merchandise being sold by the club and local businesses.

===Songs===
Chants and songs include &quot;The Northern Lights of Old Aberdeen&quot; and &quot;Stand Free&quot;, the latter of which is set to the tune of &quot;Lord of the Dance&quot;.

=== Ultras ===
Aberdeen has had a few ultras groups over its lifetime. In 1999, a group of supporters formed a fan group called the red ultras; this group came together in making displays over its lifetime such as their &quot;one love&quot; display and their &quot;red ultras&quot; display. The red ultras disbanded at the beginning of 2010.
Following the introduction of the &quot;Red Shed&quot;, a new group going by the name of &quot;Ultras Aberdeen&quot; formed in 2022 and have made displays such as the &quot;Heroes&quot; display in tribute to 1983 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup final. There was also a display at Hampden Park for the 2023 Viaplay League Cup final against Rangers. The group has also been responsible for surfing flag displays as well the use of pyrotechnics such as smoke bombs and flares.

<text>Prime Suspect is a British police procedural television series devised by Lynda La Plante. It stars Helen Mirren as Jane Tennison, one of the first female Detective Chief Inspectors in Greater London&#x27;s Metropolitan Police Service, who rises to the rank of Detective Superintendent while confronting institutionalised sexism within the police force.

==Plot==
&quot;Prime Suspect&quot; focuses on a no-nonsense female Detective Chief Inspector (DCI), Jane Tennison (played by Helen Mirren), who is an officer in the Metropolitan Police, initially at the fictional Southampton Row police station.

The series follows her constant battles to prove herself within a male-dominated profession in which many of her colleagues are determined to see her fail, though she has the support of her boss, Detective Chief Superintendent Mike Kernan (John Benfield), and the loyalty of Detective Sergeant Richard Haskons (Richard Hawley).

In later series, Tennison is reassigned to rotating duties, including a vice squad in Soho and a gang squad in Manchester. She is promoted to Detective Superintendent in series 4 and retires from policing at the end of series 7.

== Episodes ==

==Concept and development==
===Themes===
The first series features sexism in the workplace as a significant subplot and a barrier to the investigation. Sequels have tended to downplay this theme, relying on straight procedure or on other subplots, such as institutional racism in &quot;Prime Suspect 2&quot; or child sexual abuse and prostitution in &quot;Prime Suspect 3&quot;, but they continue to demonstrate the determination of some of Tennison&#x27;s male peers and those in upper echelons to see her fail.

Tennison&#x27;s difficulty in achieving a balance between her work and her life outside the job, and her difficulty in maintaining stable relationships, are recurring themes within the series. Towards the end of &quot;Prime Suspect 3&quot; she arranges to have her pregnancy terminated. As the series progresses, she increasingly relies on alcohol to help her cope. This culminates in the final episode of the series in her attending meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous, where she finally acknowledges and confronts her addiction.

===Setting===
&quot;Prime Suspect&quot; is set mostly in London and surrounding areas, but series 5 is set in Manchester.

===Production===
Every series of &quot;Prime Suspect&quot; except series 4 follows a single case and runs around 3 hours (excluding commercials). It has usually been shown in two or four parts. &quot;Prime Suspect 4&quot; is an exception at slightly over five hours, with three separate cases.

The first five series were produced annually from 1991 to 1996, until Mirren left the role, supposedly to avoid typecasting (according to a PBS interview). She returned to play the character in 2003 and again in 2006.

&quot;Prime Suspect&quot; was produced by Granada Television for the ITV network. Series four to seven were co-produced by WGBH Boston for its &quot;Masterpiece Mystery&quot; anthology series.

===Music===
The first five series were scored by the Academy Award-winning composer Stephen Warbeck, who was nominated for a BAFTA TV Award for &quot;Prime Suspect&quot; series one. Rob Lane composed the music for Series 6. Nicholas Hooper won a BAFTA TV Award for his score for Series 7.

==Reception and impact==
&quot;Prime Suspect&quot; was voted 68th in the list of 100 Greatest British Television Programmes as compiled by a poll given by the British Film Institute, and in 2007 it was listed as one of &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Best TV Shows of All-&quot;TIME&quot;.&quot; The series has won multiple BAFTA Awards, Emmy Awards, and a Peabody Award.

===Awards and nominations===
&quot;Prime Suspect&quot; won the BAFTA TV Award for Best Drama Serial over &quot;G.B.H.&quot; in 1991. Afterwards, four of the seven voting members of the jury raised a discrepancy to jury chairperson Irene Shubik, and later signed a public statement declaring that they had voted for &quot;G.B.H.&quot; to win. BAFTA Chairman Richard Price stated that the ballot papers passed on to him by Shubik had shown four votes for &quot;Prime Suspect&quot; and three for &quot;G.B.H.&quot; Price claimed that the ballot papers could not be recounted as they had subsequently been destroyed. &quot;Prime Suspect&quot; won Best Drama Serial once more for series three, and was nominated four other times. The series won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Miniseries three times, and was nominated twice more.

Mirren won three BAFTA TV Awards for Best Actress for the role, and has been nominated three other times. She won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie twice, with four additional nominations.

&quot;Prime Suspect 3&quot; was awarded a Peabody Award in 1993 for its realistic scenes and dialogue. Writer/creator Lynda La Plante received an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for series one in the category of Best TV Feature or Miniseries. The following year, Allan Cubitt won in the same category for series two. &quot;Prime Suspect&quot; was later nominated for series three and six.

===Influence on other programmes===
Many observers have viewed &quot;Prime Suspect&quot; as the inspiration for female characters in U.S. TV series, particularly noting strong similarities between this series in general—and the character of Jane Tennison in particular—and the later American series &quot;The Closer&quot;, starring Kyra Sedgwick in the role of Deputy Chief of Police Brenda Leigh Johnson. Critics noted the similarities between the series in a stronger way during the first seasons of &quot;The Closer&quot;, with one 2006 article in &quot;USA Today&quot; calling &quot;The Closer&quot; &quot;an unofficial Americanization&quot; of the British series, and a later reviewer noting that, &quot;When &quot;The Closer&quot; was first shown, critics were quick to compare it to &quot;Prime Suspect&quot;...[and] there&#x27;s something in that...&quot;

In interviews Sedgwick has acknowledged that &quot;The Closer&quot; owes &quot;a debt&quot; to &quot;Prime Suspect&quot;, and that her admiration for that show and for Mirren were factors that first interested her in the role. According to Sedgwick, &quot;Prime Suspect&quot; was one of the shows that &quot;paved the way&quot; for &quot;The Closer&quot;, and her manager got her interested in the series by saying that it was &quot;a little bit like &quot;Prime Suspect&quot;.&quot; Sedgwick is quoted as saying that the Tennison character did become her inspiration in some ways for her portrayal of Brenda Leigh Johnson.

Reviewers in U.S. papers, including the &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot;, have noted that &quot;The Closer&quot;, while not a direct remake of the British series, &quot;owes&quot; much to it, or that it &quot;echoes many of the elements&quot; of it. One &quot;The New York Times&quot; article refers to &quot;The Closer&quot; as a &quot;direct descendant&quot; of &quot;Prime Suspect&quot;, although less hard-hitting than the original:

Other reviewers have also made the point that the differences between Tennison and Johnson are as important as their similarities:

NBC picked up an adaptation of the British series for the 2011–2012 season. It was taken off the schedule after 13 episodes were produced.

===Spoofs===
In 1997 a short spoof episode &quot;Prime Cracker&quot; was produced for the BBC&#x27;s biennial Red Nose Day charity telethon in aid of Comic Relief. A crossover with ITV stablemate crime drama &quot;Cracker&quot;, the spoof starred Mirren and &quot;Cracker&quot; lead Robbie Coltrane as their characters from the respective series, sending up the perceived ultra-seriousness of both shows.

&quot;Dead Ringers&quot; featured a parody with Queen Elizabeth II in the lead role, as a reaction to Helen Mirren&#x27;s portrayal of her in the 2006 film &quot;The Queen&quot;.

==Prequel series==

A six-part prequel, &quot;Prime Suspect 1973&quot;, was announced in 2015 by ITV, based on the book &quot;Tennison&quot; by Lynda La Plante, adapted by Glen Laker. It tells the story of a 22-year-old Jane Tennison as a probationary WPC in Hackney, London, investigating her first murder case. The series began airing on 2 March 2017. The role of Tennison is played by Stefanie Martini. In June 2017, ITV confirmed that the series had not been recommissioned for a second series.

==Home media==
On 1 October 2013, Netflix made the Series 1–6 available online for streaming. On 27 August 2013, Acorn Media released the entire series in a seven-disc Blu-ray Disc set. Each disc contains the individual programme, upscaled to 1080p HD and converted to 16:9 Widescreen (apart from season 4 episode 1 which remains in 4:3 aspect ratio). Bonus material includes a 50-minute behind-the-scenes special, a 23-minute &quot;Series 6&quot; behind-the-scenes featurette, a photo gallery and cast filmographies.

The DVD format of the series was released in 2010 by ITV Studios/Global entertainment. It has an overall running time of 1,437 minutes approximately, and encompasses ten discs, with each Series set on one disc except the triple-episode Series 4, which is set over three discs. As with the Blu-ray production, the final disc contains a Behind-the-Scenes of Series 7.

<doc id="237028" wikidata="Q1421388" url="?curid=237028" title="Xcel Energy Center">
<text>Xcel Energy Center is a multipurpose arena in Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States. Completed in 2000 and often called &quot;The X&quot; by fans, it is named for its locally based corporate sponsor Xcel Energy. With an official capacity of 17,954, the arena has four spectator levels: one suite level and three for general seating. The building is home to the NHL&#x27;s Minnesota Wild and the Minnesota Frost of the PWHL.

The arena is owned by the city of Saint Paul and operated by the Wild&#x27;s parent company, Minnesota Sports &amp; Entertainment. It is on the same block of downtown St. Paul as the RiverCentre convention facility, the Roy Wilkins Auditorium, and the Ordway Center for the Performing Arts, and shares a single indoor access area with the RiverCentre and Roy Wilkins Auditorium.

==History==
The arena opened on September 29, 2000. It was built on the site of the demolished St. Paul Civic Center. The push for a new arena in Saint Paul grew after the National Hockey League&#x27;s Minnesota North Stars moved to Dallas. Saint Paul courted the Hartford Whalers and Winnipeg Jets under Mayor Norm Coleman, but the Civic Center was an obstacle to both deals. In order to get an NHL expansion team, Saint Paul needed to build a new arena. After several failed attempts to get funding, the state funded the project in April 1998. It gave Saint Paul a no-interest loan of $65 million for the $130 million project, though it forgave $17 million of that in exchange for having high school sports championships played at the arena.

The arena hosted the Vote for Change Tour on October 5, 2004, featuring performances by Bright Eyes, R.E.M. and Bruce Springsteen &amp; The E Street Band (with special guest John Fogerty and unannounced guest Neil Young).

In 2006, the Twin Cities were selected as the hosting metropolis for the 2008 Republican National Convention, and the arena was chosen as the main venue. The convention was held there on September 1-4, 2008. The manager of the Xcel Energy Center at the time was Minnesota Sports &amp; Entertainment whose owner Craig Leipold is also the owner of the Minnesota Wild and a prominent Republican and supporter of George W. Bush and Mitt Romney.

The 10 millionth person passed through its gates on July 3, 2007.

In 2010, ESPN magazine listed a Minnesota Wild game at Xcel Energy Center as the third-best stadium experience in North America.

In December 2023, Saint Paul city officials spoke on the condition of the venue, stating that it was &quot;showing its age&quot;, and said needed renovations could cost &quot;several hundred million [dollars]...based on similar renovations&quot;. The project would focus on modernizing the facility to meet demands of newer generations of visitors.

==Features==
The concourse areas contain hockey jerseys from every Minnesota high school on the walls, reflecting the &quot;State of Hockey.&quot; Surrounding the arena at all four corners are &quot;crow&#x27;s nests.&quot; One features an organ and is played during Wild games. The second features a lighthouse that houses a foghorn that is blasted when the team takes the ice before games, for all Wild and Frost goals, and after a victory. The third is used for the Wild&#x27;s drum line. The fourth provides an additional stage for various uses.

Before it opened, the arena installed an integrated scoring, video, information and advertising display system by Daktronics. The system includes a large LED circular, center-hung scoreboard with multiple displays, nearly of ribbon display technology mounted on the fascia and large video displays outside the facility. The center ice display was replaced in the summer of 2014. Of the 10 LED screens, the largest measures wide by high. In 2015 the arena began replacing every seat in the building with cushioned seating. This was finished by early 2016.

==Attendance records==

== Sustainability efforts ==
The campus of Xcel Energy Center, Saint Paul RiverCentre, and The Roy Wilkins Auditorium has three world-class certifications: 
* Green Globes Certification – November 2017
* LEED Platinum Certification – September 2019
* Event Industry Council (EIC) Sustainable Event Standards (SES) – Gold Certification – November 2020

The Xcel Energy Center and Saint Paul RiverCentre campus is the world&#x27;s first complex to receive all three of those certifications. The road to achieving them took several years. Some of the steps taken to achieve these awards are:
*60% of all waste is recycled
*40% of staff commute by bus, bike, carpool or an efficient vehicle
*90% of cleaning products meet green standards

In addition to the efforts made by staff, Xcel Energy Center has partnered with the NHL to join Change the Course, a national initiative promoting water conservation and restoration. To highlight its achievements, the Xcel Energy Center produced Exceptionally Green: Minnesota Wild, Saint Paul RiverCentre and Xcel Energy Center.

==Sports==
Xcel Energy Center is a hub for sports events in the Midwest. In 2004, ESPN named the arena the best overall sports venue in the U.S. It hosted the NCAA Frozen Four tournament in 2002, 2011, 2018, and 2024. The National Lacrosse League&#x27;s Minnesota Swarm played in the arena from January 2005 until they moved to Georgia in 2015. The Minnesota Lynx of the WNBA used Xcel Energy Center during the 2016 WNBA Playoffs and the 2017 WNBA season as their home arena, Minneapolis&#x27;s Target Center, was undergoing renovation. As of 2018, it is host venue of the NCHC Frozen Faceoff. The venue formerly hosted the Big Ten Men&#x27;s Ice Hockey Tournament, alternating with Joe Louis Arena in Detroit. The venue is used by the Minnesota State High School League (MSHSL) for its Girls Volleyball State Tournament, Wrestling State Tournament, and the Boys and Girls Hockey State Tournaments.

The Minnesota Wild played their first game at the arena on October 11, 2000, against the Philadelphia Flyers. Their first win at the arena came on October 18, 2000, when they defeated the Tampa Bay Lightning 6–5. The Wild&#x27;s first playoff game at the arena was on April 14, 2003. In that game, the Wild suffered a 3–0 loss to the Colorado Avalanche. On April 21, 2003, the Wild won their first playoff game 3–2 on an overtime game-winner by Richard Park. On April 26, 2015, the Wild clinched a playoff series at the arena for the first time, defeating the St. Louis Blues 4–1 in game six of the Western Conference Quarterfinals.

In 2023, it was announced that the Minnesota Frost of the Professional Women&#x27;s Hockey League would be based out of the arena. The team hosted its inaugural home game on January 6, 2023—a 3–0 shutout victory over the Montréal Victoire. Grace Zumwinkle scored the first home goal for the Frost, and went on to record a hat-trick; Maddie Rooney recorded the shutout. With more than 13,000 fans in attendance, the game set a new record for attendance at a professional women&#x27;s hockey game.

==Concerts==
Various music artists have held concerts at the arena since its opening in 2000. Some of these include Taylor Swift, Olivia Rodrigo, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Imagine Dragons, Elton John, Pink, Madonna, Pentatonix, Kelly Clarkson, Ariana Grande, Post Malone, Beyoncé, Shania Twain, Iron Maiden and Bruno Mars.

==Funding==
In 1998, the state made a $65 million interest-free loan toward construction of the $130 million arena, $17 million of which was forgiven when the team agreed to allow amateur and public events. That left a loan of $48 million.

In 2013, the state legislature passed an omnibus jobs, housing and commerce bill that included forgiveness of the remaining $32.7 million loan to Xcel Energy Center.

Under the terms of the forgiveness deal in this bill, St. Paul&#x27;s annual loan payment was reduced by $500,000 in 2014 and again in 2015. The balance of the loan was forgiven in 2016. The city still owes $56.8 million in bonds on the arena, of the $72.7 million it borrowed in 1998.

<text>The Toronto Arenas or Torontos were a professional men&#x27;s ice hockey team that played in the first two seasons of the National Hockey League (NHL). It was operated by the owner of the Arena Gardens, the Toronto Arena Company. As the ownership of the National Hockey Association (NHA) Toronto Blueshirts franchise was in dispute, the new NHL league was started, and a temporary Toronto franchise was operated. The NHL itself was intended to only be a one-year entity until the NHA could be reactivated, although it never was.

For the first season, 1917–18, the team operated without a formal organization separate from the Arena Company and without an official club nickname. However, the press would dub the team the &quot;Blue Shirts&quot; or &quot;Torontos&quot; as they had done with the NHA franchise. After the 1918–1919 season, the Arena Company was granted a permanent franchise in the NHL, which evolved into today&#x27;s Toronto Maple Leafs.

==History==

===1917–18 season===
By the fall of 1917, a dispute between Eddie Livingstone, owner of the Blueshirts, and the owners of the NHA&#x27;s other four clubs—the Montreal Canadiens, Montreal Wanderers, Ottawa Senators and Quebec Bulldogs had come to a boil. The other NHA owners were eager to disassociate themselves from Livingstone, but discovered that the NHA&#x27;s constitution did not allow them to simply vote Livingstone out. With this in mind, on November 22 the NHA board of directors voted to suspend operations. At the same time, the other four NHA clubs voted to create a new league—the National Hockey League. However, they did not invite Livingstone to join them, effectively leaving him in a one-team league.

However, the other club owners felt it would be unthinkable not to have a team from Canada&#x27;s second-largest city in the NHL. They also needed a fourth team to balance the schedule, since the Bulldogs were forced to suspend operations due to financial troubles (and, as it turned out, would not return until 1920). To solve the problem, NHL president Frank Calder assigned the contracts of the Blueshirt players to a &#x27;temporary&#x27; Toronto franchise to be operated by the Toronto Arena Company, who also owned the Montreal Arena. Calder had ordered Livingstone to sell the team, but Livingstone turned down several offers. The Arena Company was given a year to resolve the dispute or lose the franchise. The Arena Company did agree to compensate Livingstone for the use of the players for the season, although no suitable figure was ever reached, and the league itself disputed any claims that Livingstone had on the players.

As the Arena Gardens was the only suitable place to play at the time, the players had little choice but to play for the Arena team, if they wanted to play in the NHL. The NHL had also publicly announced that there was an agreement to buy out Livingstone, though this never took place. The team did not have an official name, but since it was made up mostly of former Blue Shirts, the media and fans called them &quot;the Torontos&quot; or even &quot;the Blue Shirts,&quot; as they had Livingstone&#x27;s former team. Many of the players signed contracts with both Livingstone and the Torontos, and often were paid in cash or personal cheques on a week-by-week basis. Despite this uncertainty, the team was successful from the start under coach Dick Carroll and general manager Charlie Querrie. The team won the second half of the 1917–18 NHL season, leading to a playoff against the Montreal Canadiens. The Torontos won the playoff and would then face off against the Vancouver Millionaires for the Stanley Cup. Toronto then won the best-of-five series 3–2. After the Cup win, the team did not engrave its name on the Stanley Cup, as would later become the custom.

Unlike the other two NHL franchises with NHA roots, the Canadiens and the Senators, the Maple Leafs do not claim the Blue Shirts&#x27; history as their own, as the NHL was formed to remove Livingstone from the NHA and that franchise was folded. As such, pre-NHL Toronto could not be part of Maple Leafs history. They do, however, claim the history of the &quot;temporary&quot; Toronto franchise of 1917–18.

===1918–1919 season===
In 1918, the NHA voted to suspend operations once again, and the other owners made plans to operate the NHL for a second season. Since the Torontos had won the Cup, even more revenue was at stake and Livingstone held out for $20,000, though the Arena offered $6,000. This led to Livingstone filing another lawsuit, this against the Arena owners. In response, instead of returning the players to Livingstone, or even paying Livingstone, the Arena Company returned their temporary franchise to the NHL and immediately formed a new club, the Toronto Arena Hockey Club, popularly known as the Toronto Arenas, with Arena Company auditor Hubert Vearncombe as president. The new club was a separate corporation that could exist separate from any legal action. This new team was readily admitted to the NHL as a member in good standing. (The Maple Leafs themselves say they were known as the Arenas during their first season, but the name &quot;Arenas&quot; was not recorded to commemorate the team&#x27;s 1918 Cup victory until 1947.) They also decided that only NHL teams would be allowed to play at the Arena Gardens, effectively foreclosing Livingstone&#x27;s efforts to resurrect the NHA.

To restate and clarify a somewhat confusing series of events: four of the five clubs that played in the NHA seceded to form the NHL in 1917. The players from the fifth club, the Blueshirts, were &quot;leased&quot; to the Arena Company and skated as a &quot;temporary&quot; Toronto NHL franchise in the league&#x27;s inaugural season. After the Torontos won the Stanley Cup, the Arena Company was granted a permanent NHL franchise, but retained the former Blueshirts players. It is this franchise that began the lineage of today&#x27;s Maple Leafs.

This year, the club was not successful, falling to 5 wins and 13 losses, finishing last in both halves of the season. Attendance was especially poor, recorded as only hundreds for a February 4, 1919 game against the Canadiens. Several players left the team, including Harry Holmes, Harry Meeking and Dave Ritchie. This was partly due to the legal status of the team; since most players were really still &quot;property&quot; of the Blueshirts, they didn&#x27;t have formal contracts and were being paid under the table in cash.

The team wrote to Calder to end the season early, and the season ended after each team had played 18 games. The Toronto Arenas then officially withdrew from the league on February 20, 1919. This left the two remaining teams, Montreal and Ottawa, to play a playoff for the league championship.

===1919–1920 season===
On December 13, 1919, the NHL approved the sale of the Arenas to a group fronted by Querrie, for the fee of $5,000. While the money was to go to Livingstone to compensate him for the loss of his NHA club, Livingstone never received the money. By all accounts, Calder pocketed the money himself. The team was renamed the Toronto St. Patricks. The incorporation date of the club was December 22, 1919. Querrie, Fred Hambly, Percy Hambly, and Paul Ciceri owned 99 shares each, while Richard Greer owned 4 shares.

<doc id="237030" wikidata="Q330318" url="?curid=237030" title="Yellow-browed warbler">
<text>The yellow-browed warbler (Phylloscopus inornatus) is a leaf warbler (family Phylloscopidae) which breeds in the east Palearctic. This warbler is strongly migratory and winters mainly in tropical South Asia and South-east Asia, but also in small numbers in western Europe. Like the rest of Phylloscopidae, it was formerly included in the Old World warbler assemblage.

It was formerly considered to comprise three subspecies, but &quot;P. i. humei&quot; and &quot;P. i. mandellii&quot; are now split as a separate species, Hume&#x27;s leaf warbler &quot;P. humei&quot;, leaving &quot;P. inornatus&quot; monotypic. The two sister species differ slightly but consistently in morphology, bioacoustics, and molecular characters. Before the species was split, the names yellow-browed willow warbler and inornate warbler were used by a few authors.

==Taxonomy==
The yellow-browed warbler was first described by the English zoologist Edward Blyth in 1842 and given the binomial name &quot;Regulus inornatus&quot;. The current genus name &quot;Phylloscopus&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;phullon&quot;, &quot;leaf&quot;, and &quot;skopos&quot;, &quot;seeker&quot; (from &quot;skopeo&quot;, &quot;to watch&quot;). The specific &quot;inornatus&quot; is Latin for &quot;plain&quot;.

==Description==
This is one of the smaller Old World warblers, at 9.5–11 cm long and weighing 4–9 g distinctly smaller than a chiffchaff but slightly larger than Pallas&#x27;s leaf warbler. Like many other leaf warblers, it has overall greenish upperparts and white underparts. It also has prominent double wing bars formed by yellowish-white tips to the wing covert feathers (a long bar on the greater coverts and a short bar on the median coverts), yellow-margined tertial feathers, and long yellow supercilium. Some individuals also have a faint paler green central crown stripe though many do not show this.

It is not shy, but its arboreal life style makes it difficult to observe. It is almost constantly in motion. Its song is a high-pitched medley of whistles; the call is piercing, often disyllabic &quot;tseeweest&quot;, strikingly loud for the bird&#x27;s small size. The only real possibility of confusion is with the similar-looking Hume&#x27;s leaf warbler (&quot;P. humei&quot;), which in the limited area of overlap has duller colours, a faint second wing bar and dark legs and lower mandible. Their songs and calls are clearly distinct, with Hume&#x27;s having a more chirping &quot;chwee&quot; call. It can easily be distinguished from Pallas&#x27;s warbler as it does not have the conspicuous yellow central crown stripe and rump patch shown by that species.

==Ecology and distribution==
Like most warblers, it is insectivorous. The nest is built in dense vegetation often at the base of a tree or old stump; two to four (occasionally more) eggs are laid, hatching after 11–14 days, with the chicks fledging when 12–13 days old.

This is an abundant bird of lowland and montane forests and woodlands; particularly in winter it may also be found in more open woods. Its breeding range extends from just west of the Ural Mountains eastwards to eastern Siberia, Mongolia and Northeast China. Its winter habitat is lowland broadleaf or coniferous forest, from West Bengal and Assam in northeastern India east through southern China to Taiwan, and through Bangladesh south to the Malay Peninsula. In summer, it occurs at altitudes of up to 2,440 m, and in winter, up to 1,525 m.

The European breeding population west of the Urals has increased westwards in recent decades; in 1950 it was described as &#x27;fairly scarce&#x27;, but &#x27;locally abundant&#x27; with 45,000–46,000 pairs in 1990.

Small numbers, most likely from the western end of the breeding range, regularly winter in western Europe. These arrive in Great Britain in late September and October after a 3,000–3,500 km migration from the Urals, a markedly shorter distance than the 5,500–6,000 km they would need to fly to reach the normal wintering areas in southeastern Asia. Exact numbers in this population are unknown, but typically several hundred are found arriving in Great Britain each autumn; given their unobtrusive behaviour, this is probably only a fraction of the total. In the past widely considered to be vagrants, these birds are now thought to be undertaking a normal regular migration, able to take advantage of the mild oceanic climate winters on the western fringes of Europe for wintering.

A common species in most of its wide range, the yellow-browed warbler is not considered threatened by the IUCN.

Hume&#x27;s leaf warbler overlaps its breeding range with yellow-browed warbler in the western Sayan Mountains, but the species apparently do not hybridise. Their lineages diverged roughly 2.5 million years ago.

<doc id="237031" wikidata="Q930414" url="?curid=237031" title="Top of the Pops">
<text>Top of the Pops (TOTP) is a British music chart television programme, made by the BBC and broadcast weekly between 1January 1964 and 30 July 2006. The programme was the world&#x27;s longest-running weekly music show. For most of its history, it was broadcast on Thursday evenings on BBC One. Each show consisted of performances of some of the week&#x27;s best-selling popular music records, usually excluding any tracks moving down the chart, including a rundown of that week&#x27;s singles chart. This was originally the Top 20, though this varied throughout the show&#x27;s history. The Top 30 was used from 1969 and the Top 40 from 1984.

Dusty Springfield&#x27;s &quot;I Only Want to Be with You&quot; was the first song featured on &quot;TOTP&quot;, while the Rolling Stones were the first band to perform with &quot;I Wanna Be Your Man&quot;. Snow Patrol were the last act to play live on the weekly show when they performed their single &quot;Chasing Cars&quot;. Status Quo made more appearances than any other artist, with a total of 106 (the first was with &quot;Pictures of Matchstick Men&quot; in 1968 and last with &quot;The Party Ain&#x27;t Over Yet&quot; in 2005).

Special editions were broadcast on Christmas Day (and usually, until 1984, a second edition a few days after Christmas), featuring some of the best-selling singles of the year and the Christmas number one. Although the weekly show was cancelled in 2006, the Christmas special continued annually. End-of-year round-up editions have also been broadcast on BBC1 on or around New Year&#x27;s Eve, albeit largely featuring the same acts and tracks as the Christmas Day shows. In a change of format, the festive specials have not returned since in 2022 and were replaced by an end-of-year review show on BBC Two. It also survives as &quot;Top of the Pops 2&quot;, which began in 1994 and features vintage performances from the &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; archives. Though &quot;TOTP2&quot; ceased producing new episodes from 2017, repeats of older episodes are still shown.

The Official Charts Company states that &quot;performing on the show was considered an honour, and it pulled in just about every major player&quot;. The show has seen seminal performances over its history. The March 1971 appearance of T. Rex frontman Marc Bolan wearing glitter and satins as he performed &quot;Hot Love&quot; is often seen as the inception of glam rock, and David Bowie&#x27;s performance of &quot;Starman&quot; inspired future musicians. In the 1990s, the show&#x27;s format was sold to several foreign broadcasters in the form of a franchise package, and at one point various versions of the show were shown in more than 120 countries. Editions of the programme from 1976 onwards started being repeated on BBC Four in 2011 and are aired on most Friday evenings – as of 2025, the repeat run has reached 1997. Episodes featuring disgraced presenters and artists such as Jimmy Savile, Dave Lee Travis, Ian Watkins, Jonathan King, Rolf Harris, Gary Glitter, R. Kelly and Diddy are no longer repeated.

==History==
Bill Cotton devised the name &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. Cotton, Johnnie Stewart and Stanley Dorfman devised the rules which governed how the show would operate: the programme would always end with the number one record, which was the only record that could appear in consecutive weeks. The show would include the highest new entry, and (if not featured in the previous week) the highest climber on the charts, and omit any song going down in the chart. Tracks could be featured in consecutive weeks in different formats. For example, if a song was played over the chart countdown or the closing credits, then it was acceptable for the act to appear in the studio the following week.

These rules were sometimes interpreted flexibly. It was originally based on the Top 20. By the 1970s, the Top 30 was being used and the show was extended from thirty to forty-five minutes duration and songs that were featured outside the charts were chosen according to Dorfman and his fellow producer&#x27;s Melvyn Cornish&#x27;s personal taste and judgement. The rules were more formally relaxed from 1997 when records descending the charts were featured more regularly, possibly as a response to the changing nature of the Top 40 (in the late 1990s and early 2000s climbers in the charts were a rarity, with almost all singles peaking at their debut position).

When the programme&#x27;s format changed in November 2003, it concentrated increasingly on the top 10. Later, during the BBC Two era, the top 20 was regarded as the main cut-off point, with the exception made for up and coming bands below the top 20. Singles from below the top 40 (within the top 75) were shown if the band were up and coming or had a strong selling album. If a single being performed was below the top 40, just the words &quot;New Entry&quot; were shown and not the chart position.

The show was originally intended to run for only a few programmes but lasted over 42 years, reaching landmark episodes of 500, 1,000, 1,500 and 2,000 in the years 1973, 1983, 1992 and 2002 respectively.

===The first show===


The first edition of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; was broadcast on Wednesday, 1January 1964 at 6:35 pm. It was produced in Studio A at Dickenson Road Studios in Rusholme, Manchester.

The first show was presented by Jimmy Savile, with a brief link to Alan Freeman in London to preview the following week&#x27;s programme. The producer Johnnie Stewart based the show&#x27;s format on Savile&#x27;s &quot;Teen and Twenty Disc Club&quot; on Radio Luxembourg. The first show featured (in order) Dusty Springfield with &quot;I Only Want to Be with You&quot;, the Rolling Stones with &quot;I Wanna Be Your Man&quot;, the Dave Clark Five with &quot;Glad All Over&quot;, the Hollies with &quot;Stay&quot;, the Swinging Blue Jeans with &quot;Hippy Hippy Shake&quot; and the Beatles with &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot;, that week&#x27;s number one. Throughout its history, the programme proper always (with very few exceptions) finished with the best-selling single of the week, although there often was a separate play-out track over the end credits.

===1960s and 1970s===
Later in 1964, the broadcast time was moved to one hour later, at 7:35 pm, and the show moved from Wednesdays to what became its regular Thursday slot. Additionally its length was extended by 5minutes to 30 minutes.

For the first three years Alan Freeman, David Jacobs, Pete Murray and Jimmy Savile rotated presenting duties, with the following week&#x27;s presenter also appearing at the end of each show, although this practice ceased from October 1964 onwards.

The show was taped 52 weeks a year with no breaks. The chart came out on Tuesday mornings and the show aired live on Thursday evenings. This led to a process of difficult weekly planning, rescheduling, booking, and rebooking, as well as pre-recording of acts, particularly of American artists who might be advancing up the chart the following weeks, to ensure that each weeks top 20 would be able to appear on the show. At the BBC in the 1960s and early 1970s, producers and directors did both jobs simultaneously. From 1964 to 1969, Stewart and Dorfman took it in turns to produce and direct, but each spent five days a week getting the show together. At the end of 1969, Stewart left, and was replaced in early 1970 by Melvyn Cornish, Stewart returned as an executive producer in 1971 until 1973. Dorfman directed and produced the series from 1964 until 1971, then continued for five years thereafter as an executive producer.

In the first few editions, Denise Sampey was the &quot;disc girl&quot;, who would be seen to put the record on a turntable before the next act played their track. However, a Mancunian model, Samantha Juste, became the regular disc girl after a few episodes, a role she performed until 1967.

Initially acts performing on the show would mime (lip-sync) to the commercially released record, but in 1966 after discussions with the Musicians&#x27; Union, miming was banned. After a few weeks during which some bands&#x27; attempts to play as well as on their records were somewhat lacking, a compromise was reached whereby a specially recorded backing track was permitted, as long as all the musicians on the track were present in the studio. As a result, Stewart hired Johnny Pearson to conduct an in-studio orchestra to provide musical backing on select performances, beginning with the 4 August 1966 edition. Later, vocal group The Ladybirds began providing vocal backing with the orchestra.

With the birth of BBC Radio 1 in 1967, new Radio1 DJs were added to the roster – Stuart Henry, Emperor Rosko, Simon Dee and Kenny Everett.

Local photographer Harry Goodwin was hired to provide shots of non-appearing artists, and also to provide backdrops for the chart run-down. He continued in the role until 1973.

After two years at the Manchester Dickenson Road Studios, the show moved to London (considered to be better located for bands to appear), initially for six months at BBC TV Centre Studio2 and then to the larger Studio G at BBC Lime Grove Studios in mid-1966 to provide space for the Top of the Pops Orchestra, which was introduced at this time to provide live instrumentation on some performances (previously, acts had generally mimed to the records). In November 1969, with the introduction of colour, the show moved to BBC TV Centre, where it stayed until 1991, when it moved to Elstree Studios Studio C.

For a while in the early 1970s, non-chart songs were played on a more regular basis, to reflect the perceived growing importance of album sales; there was an album slot featuring three songs from a new LP, as well as a &quot;New Release&quot; spot and a feature of a new act, dubbed &quot;Tip for the Top&quot;. These features were dropped after a while, although the programme continued to feature new releases on a regular basis for the rest of the decade.

During its heyday, it attracted 15 million viewers each week. The peak TV audience of 19 million was recorded in 1979, during the ITV strike, with only BBC1 and BBC2 on air.

===&quot;Christmas Top of the Pops&quot;===
A year-end Christmas show which used a &quot;The Year in Review&quot; format, was inaugurated on 24 December 1964 and has continued every year since. From 1965 until 2021, the special edition was broadcast on Christmas Day (although not in 1966) and from the same year, a second edition was broadcast in the days after Christmas, varying depending on the schedule, but initially regularly on 26 December. The first was shown on 26 December 1965. In 2022, the Christmas show was moved to BBC Two and broadcast on 24 December, with no usual studio-based live performances included in the broadcast. In 1973, there was just one show, airing on Christmas Day. In place of the traditional second show, Jimmy Savile hosted a look back at the first 10 years of &quot;TOTP&quot;, broadcast on 27 December. In 1975, the first of the two shows was broadcast prior to Christmas Day, airing on 23 December, followed by the traditional Christmas Day show two days later.

The 1978 Christmas Day show was disrupted due to industrial action at the BBC, requiring a change in format to the broadcast. The first show, due to be screened on 21 December, was not shown at all because BBC1 was off the air. For Christmas Day, Noel Edmonds (presenting his last ever edition of &quot;TOTP&quot;) hosted the show from the &#x27;TOTP Production Office&#x27; with clips taken from various editions of the show broadcast during the year and new studio footage performed without an audience. The format was slightly tweaked for the Christmas Day edition in 1981, with the Radio1 DJs choosing their favourite tracks of the year and the following edition on 31 December featuring the year&#x27;s number1 hits. The second programme was discontinued after 1984.

===1980s===
The year 1980 marked major production changes to &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; and a hiatus forced by industrial action. Steve Wright made his presenting debut on 7 February 1980. Towards the end of February 1980, facing a £40 million budget deficit, the BBC laid off five orchestras as part of £130 million in cuts. The budget cuts led to a Musicians&#x27; Union strike that suspended operations of all 11 BBC orchestras and performances of live music on the BBC; &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; went out of production between 29 May and 7 August 1980. During the Musicians&#x27; Union strike, BBC1 showed repeats of &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; in the regular &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; Thursday night time slot.

Following the strike, Nash was replaced as executive producer by Michael Hurll, who introduced more of a &quot;party&quot; atmosphere to the show, with performances often accompanied by balloons and cheerleaders, and more audible audience noise and cheering. Hurll also laid off the orchestra, as the Musicians&#x27; Union was loosening enforcement of the 1966 miming ban.

Guest co-presenters and a music news feature were introduced for a short while, but had ceased by the end of 1980. The chart rundown was split into three sections in the middle of the programme, with the final Top 10 section initially featuring clips of the songs&#x27; videos, although this became rarer over the next few years.

An occasional feature showing the American music scene with Jonathan King was introduced in November 1981, and ran every few weeks until February 1985. In January 1985, a &quot;Breakers&quot; section, featuring short video clips of new tracks in the lower end of the Top 40, was introduced, and this continued for most weeks until March 1994.

Although the programme had been broadcast live in its early editions, it had been recorded on the day before transmission for many years. However, from May 1981, the show was sometimes broadcast live for a few editions each year, and this practice continued on an occasional basis (often in the week of a bank holiday, when the release of the new chart was delayed, and for some special editions) for the rest of the decade.

The programme moved in September 1985 to a new regular half-hour timeslot of 7 pm on Thursdays, following wider reforms to BBC TV scheduling by then-controller Michael Grade. With the exception of special editions, this saw the end of its longer episodes, which had ranged between 35 and 45 minutes in previous years. Coupled with an emphasis on video clips via features such as the aforementioned &quot;Breakers&quot; section, fewer studio acts could appear due to this, leading to renewed general criticism from both viewers and performers, and occasionally putting the show at a slight disadvantage to other music television programmes (alongside later dedicated channels for music videos) such as &quot;The Tube&quot; and the revived &quot;Whistle Test&quot; (though both would end in 1987).

The end of 1988 was marked by a special 70-minute edition of the show broadcast on 31 December 1988, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the first show. The pre-recorded programme featured the return of the original four presenters (Savile, Freeman, Murray and Jacobs) as well as numerous presenters from the show&#x27;s history, anchored by Paul Gambaccini and Mike Read. Numerous clips from the history of the show were included in between acts performing in the studio, which included Cliff Richard, Engelbert Humperdinck, Lulu, the Four Tops, David Essex, Mud, Status Quo, Shakin&#x27; Stevens, the Tremeloes and from the very first edition, the Swinging Blue Jeans. Sandie Shaw, the Pet Shop Boys and Wet Wet Wet were billed in the &quot;Radio Times&quot; to appear, but none featured in the show other than Shaw in compilation clips.

Paul Ciani took over as producer in 1988. The following year, in an attempt to fit more songs in the allocated half-hour again, he restricted the duration of studio performances to three minutes, and videos to two minutes, a practice which was largely continued until May 1997. In July 1990, he introduced a rundown of the Top5 albums, which continued on a monthly basis until May 1991. Ciani had to step down due to illness in 1991, when Hurll returned as producer to cover for two months (and again for a brief time as holiday cover in 1992).

===1991: &#x27;Year Zero&#x27; revamp===
From 1967, the show had become closely associated with the BBC radio station Radio 1, usually being presented by DJs from the station, and between 1988 and 1991 the programme was simulcast on the radio station in FM stereo (that is, until BBC&#x27;s launch of NICAM stereo for TV made such simulcasts redundant). However, during the last few years of the 1980s the association became less close, and was severed completely (although not permanently) in a radical shake-up known as the &#x27;Year Zero&#x27; revamp.

Following a fall in viewing figures and a general perception that the show had become &#x27;uncool&#x27; (acts like the Clash had refused to appear in the show in previous years), incoming executive producer Stanley Appel (who had worked on the programme since 1966 as cameraman, production assistant, director and stand-in producer) introduced a radical new format on 3 October 1991, in which the Radio1 DJs were replaced by a team of relative unknowns, such as Claudia Simon and Tony Dortie who had previously worked for Children&#x27;s BBC, 17-year-old local radio DJ Mark Franklin, Steve Anderson, Adrian Rose and Elayne Smith, who was replaced by Femi Oke in 1992. A brand new theme tune (&quot;Now Get Out of That&quot;), title sequence and logo were introduced, and the entire programme moved from BBC Television Centre in London to BBC Elstree Centre in Borehamwood.

The new presenting team would take turns hosting (initially usually in pairs but sometimes solo), and would often introduce acts in an out-of-vision voiceover over the song&#x27;s instrumental introduction. Short informal interviews were also conducted on stage with the performers, and initially the Top 10 countdown was run without any voiceover. Rules relating to performance were altered, meaning acts had to forcibly sing live as opposed to the backing tracks for instruments and mimed vocals for which the show was known. To incorporate a shift towards USA artists, more use was made of out-of-studio performances, with acts in America able to transmit their song to the &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; audience &quot;via satellite&quot;. These changes were widely unpopular and much of the presenting team were axed within a year, leaving the show hosted solely by Dortie and Franklin (apart from the Christmas Day editions, when both presenters appeared) from October 1992, on a week-by-week rotation.

===1994–1997===
By 1994, much of the &#x27;Year Zero&#x27; revamp was quickly undone and the arrival of Ric Blaxill as producer in February 1994 signalled a return to presentation from established Radio1 DJs Simon Mayo, Mark Goodier, Nicky Campbell and Bruno Brookes. Blaxill expanded the use of &quot;via satellite&quot; performances, taking the acts out of studios and concert halls and setting them against landmark backdrops. As a consequence, Bon Jovi performed &quot;Always&quot; from Niagara Falls and Celine Dion beamed in &quot;Think Twice&quot; from Miami Beach.

Blaxill also increasingly experimented with handing presenting duties to celebrities, commonly contemporary comedians and pop stars who were not in the charts at that time. In an attempt to keep the links between acts as fresh as the performances themselves, the so-called &quot;golden mic&quot; was used by, amongst others, Kylie Minogue, Meat Loaf, Chris Eubank, Damon Albarn, Harry Hill, Jack Dee, Lulu, Björk, Jarvis Cocker, Stewart Lee and Richard Herring. Radio1 DJs still presented occasionally, including Lisa I&#x27;Anson, Steve Lamacq, Jo Whiley and on one show only Chris Evans. The last remnants of the Year Zero revamp were replaced on 2 February 1995, when a new set, title sequence, logo and theme tune were introduced (the logo having first appeared on the new programme &quot;Top of the Pops 2&quot;, which had debuted five months previously in mid-September 1994).

&quot;TOTP&quot; was traditionally shown on a Thursday night, but was moved to a Friday starting on 14 June 1996, originally at 7 pm, but then shifted to 7.30 pm, a change which placed the programme up against the soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot; on ITV. This began a major decline in audience figures as fans were forced to choose between &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; and an episode of the soap.

===1997–2003===
In 1997, incoming producer Chris Cowey phased out the use of celebrities and established a rotating team of former presenters from youth music magazine &quot;The O-Zone&quot; including Jayne Middlemiss and Jamie Theakston, as well as existing Radio1 DJs Jo Whiley and Zoe Ball. The team was later augmented by Kate Thornton and Gail Porter.

Cowey additionally instigated a wider set of &#x27;back to basics&#x27; changes when he took over the show. On 1 May 1998, a remixed version of the classic &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; theme tune previously used in the 1970s was introduced, accompanied by a new 1960s-inspired logo and title sequence. Cowey also began to export the brand overseas with localised versions of the show on air in Germany, France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Italy by 2003. Finally, the programme returned to its previous home of BBC Television Centre in 2001, where it remained until its cancellation in 2006.

===2003: &quot;All New Top of the Pops&quot;===
On 28 November 2003 (three months after the appointment of Andi Peters as executive producer), the show saw one of its most radical overhauls since the ill-fated 1991 &#x27;Year Zero&#x27; revamp in what was widely reported as a make-or-break attempt to revitalise the long-running series. In a break with the previous format, the show played more up-and-coming tracks ahead of any chart success, and also featured interviews with artists and a music news feature called &quot;24/7&quot;. Most editions of the show were now broadcast live, for the first time since 1991 (apart from a couple of editions in 1994).

Although the first edition premièred to improved ratings, the &quot;All New&quot; format, hosted by MTV presenter Tim Kash, quickly returned to low ratings and brought about scathing reviews. Kash continued to host the show, but Radio1 DJs Reggie Yates and Fearne Cotton (who had each presented a few shows in 2003, before the revamp) were brought back to co-host alongside him, before Kash was completely dropped by the BBC, later taking up a new contract at MTV. The show continued to be hosted by Reggie Yates and Fearne Cotton (usually together, but occasionally solo) on Friday evenings until 8July 2005.

On 30 July 2004, the show took place outside a studio environment for the first time by broadcasting outside in Gateshead. Girls Aloud, Busted, Will Young and Jamelia were among the performers that night.

===2005: The beginning of the end===
Figures had plummeted to below three million, prompting an announcement by the BBC that the show was going to move, again, to Sunday evenings on BBC Two, thus losing the prime-time slot on BBC One that it had maintained for more than forty years.

This move was widely reported as a final &quot;sidelining&quot; of the show, and perhaps signalled its likely cancellation. At the time, it was insisted that this was so the show would air immediately after the official announcement of the new top 40 chart on Radio 1, as it was thought that by the following Friday, the chart seemed out of date. The final &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; to be shown on BBC One (barring Christmas and New Year specials) was broadcast on Monday 11 July 2005, which was edition number 2,166.

The first edition on BBC Two was broadcast on 17 July 2005 at 7.00 pm with presenter Fearne Cotton. Following the move to Sundays, Cotton continued to host with a different guest presenter each week, such as Rufus Hound or Richard Bacon. On a number of occasions, however, Reggie Yates would step in, joined by female guest presenters such as Lulu, Cyndi Lauper and Anastacia. Viewing figures during this period averaged around 1 million. Shortly after the move to BBC Two, Peters resigned as executive producer. He was replaced by the BBC&#x27;s Creative Head of Music Entertainment Mark Cooper, while producer Sally Wood remained to oversee the show on a weekly basis.

===2006: Cancellation===

On 20 June 2006, the show was formally cancelled and it was announced that the last edition would be broadcast on 30 July 2006. Edith Bowman co-presented its hour-long swansong, along with Jimmy Savile (who was the main presenter on the first show), Reggie Yates, Mike Read, Pat Sharp, Sarah Cawood, Dave Lee Travis, Rufus Hound, Tony Blackburn and Janice Long.

The final day of recording was 26 July 2006 and featured archive footage and tributes, including the Rolling Stones – the very first band to appear on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; – opening with &quot;The Last Time&quot;, the Spice Girls, David Bowie, Wham!, Madonna, Beyoncé, Gnarls Barkley, the Jackson 5, Sonny &amp; Cher and Robbie Williams. The show closed with a final countdown, topped by Shakira, as her track &quot;Hips Don&#x27;t Lie&quot; (featuring Wyclef Jean) had climbed back up to number one on the UK Singles Chart earlier in the day. The show ended with Savile ultimately turning the lights off in the empty studio.

Fearne Cotton, who was the current presenter, was unavailable to co-host for the final edition due to her filming of ITV&#x27;s &quot;Love Island&quot; in Fiji but opened the show with a quick introduction recorded on location, saying &quot;It&#x27;s still number one, it&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;&quot;. BARB reported the final show&#x27;s viewing figures as 3.98 million.

As the last episode featured no live acts in the studio, the last act to actually play live on a weekly episode of &quot;TOTP&quot; was Snow Patrol, who performed &quot;Chasing Cars&quot; in the penultimate edition; the last act ever featured visually on a weekly &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; was Girls Aloud, as part of the closing sequence of bands performing on the show throughout the years. They were shown performing &quot;Love Machine&quot;.

===2006–2023: After the end===
The magazine and &quot;TOTP2&quot; have both survived despite the show&#x27;s axing, and the Christmas editions also continue. However, the &quot;TOTP&quot; website is now no longer updated.

====Calls for its return====
In October 2008, British Culture Secretary Andy Burnham and Manchester indie band the Ting Tings called for the show to return.

On 29 October 2008, Simon Cowell stated in an interview that he would be willing to buy the rights to &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; from the BBC. The corporation responded that they had not been formally approached by Cowell, and that in any case the format was &quot;not up for sale&quot;. In November 2008, it was reported by &quot;The Times&quot; and other newspapers that the weekly programme was to be revived in 2009, but the BBC said there were no such plans.

In July 2009, Pet Shop Boys singer Neil Tennant criticised the BBC for ending the programme, stating that new acts were missing out on &quot;that great moment of being crowned that week&#x27;s Kings of Pop&quot;.

In early 2015 there was increased speculation of a return of the show including rumours that Dermot O&#x27;Leary might present alongside Fearne Cotton. According to a report in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, a BBC insider stated that &quot;some at the highest level are massive supporters of the plan [of a return] and have given the go-ahead.&quot; The move of the UK charts to a Friday due to take place in summer 2015 was also said to favour the possibility of a return, making it &quot;the perfect tie-in&quot; and a &quot;perfect start to the weekend&quot;, but no weekly return has occurred.

====BBC Four reruns====
In April 2011, the BBC began to reshow &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on Thursday nights on BBC Four beginning with the equivalent show from 35 years earlier in a 7:30 pm–8:00 pm slot approximating to the time the programme was traditionally shown. The first programme shown, 1April 1976, was chosen because it was from approximately this episode onwards that most editions remain in the BBC archive. The repeat programmes come in two versions; the first is edited down to fit in the 30-minute 7:30 slot, the second is shown normally twice overnight in the following weekend, and is usually complete. However both the short and longer editions can be edited for a number of reasons. 

Potentially offensive content to modern audiences is cut (for example The Barron Knights&#x27; in-studio performance of &quot;Food For Thought&quot; on the edition of 13 December 1979 including a segment parodying Chinese takeaways using mannerisms that may now be viewed as offensive), and cinematic film footage can be truncated, replaced or removed entirely due to the costs to the BBC of reshowing such footage. The BBC also makes the repeats available on BBC iPlayer. The repeats are continuing as of 2025 with episodes from 1997, and from 28 October 2022, older episodes from 1976 to 1992 are broadcast at 8pm.

However since October 2012, episodes featuring Jimmy Savile have ceased to be broadcast due to the sexual abuse scandal and subsequent Operation Yewtree police investigation. Following the arrest of Dave Lee Travis by Operation Yewtree officers, and his subsequent conviction for indecent assault, episodes featuring Travis were also omitted. Following Gary Glitter&#x27;s conviction for sexual assault, episodes featuring him are also not included in the run, or otherwise have Glitter&#x27;s performances edited out. Episodes featuring R. Kelly are also skipped, or have his performances edited out, following his convictions for sexual abuse. John Alford&#x27;s appearance on the show, originally broadcast on 23 May 1996, has not been repeated since he was charged with sexual offences. 
Episodes featuring Diddy are also skipped from the run, following his allegations of sexual misconduct.

Mike Smith decided not to sign the licence extension that would allow the BBC to repeat the &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; episodes that he presented, with the BBC continuing to respect his wishes following his death. Adrian Rose also chose not to allow his episodes to be repeated. As a result, episodes featuring Smith and Rose are also omitted.

====&quot;Story of&quot; Specials====
Prior to the 1976 BBC reruns shown in 2011, the BBC produced a special programme, &quot;The Story of 1976&quot;. This comprised excerpts from the 1976 programmes, interspersed with new interviews with people discussing the time period.

They produced similar programmes for subsequent calendar years, each airing before or during the run of repeats from the particular year. These specials went on hiatus following &quot;The Story of 1990&quot; in October 2020, but returned in early 2022 as a weekly series, scheduled up from &quot;The Story of 1991&quot; to &quot;The Story of 1999&quot; in May 2022.

====&quot;Big Hits&quot; compilation====
A series of &quot;Big Hits&quot; compilations have been broadcast with on-screen captions about artists.In December 2016, a festive special using the format of the &quot;Big Hits&quot; programmes, &quot;Top of the Pops: Christmas Hits&quot; was broadcast on BBC Four, featuring a mix of Christmas music and non-festive songs which had been hits at Christmas time. This effectively replaced the annual Christmas edition of &quot;Top of the Pops 2&quot;, which did not run that year.

====Christmas and New Year specials====
Although the weekly &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; has been cancelled, the Christmas Specials have continued, initially hosted by Fearne Cotton and Reggie Yates. The Christmas specials were broadcast on Christmas Day afternoon on BBC One. From 2008 to 2021 (apart from 2010 and 2011), a New Year special has also been broadcast. A new logo and title sequence were introduced on the 2019 Christmas special. The BBC&#x27;s Head of Music Television, Mark Cooper, continued to oversee the programme as executive producer until 2019 when he was replaced by Alison Howe. Meanwhile, Stephanie McWhinnie, who had replaced Wood as producer with effect from Christmas 2011, was replaced by Caroline Cullen (who had previously worked as assistant producer on the show) from Christmas 2020, when both festive shows were recorded with new studio performances but no live audience physically in attendance. On 4December 2017, Yates stepped down from hosting &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; due to comments he made regarding Jewish people and rappers. The BBC later announced Clara Amfo as Yates&#x27; replacement, she continues to hold the role. Amfo was joined by Jordan North for the 2021 specials, with him replacing Cotton.

Following a change in format for 2022, the usual studio-based festive editions with new live performances did not return and was replaced by an end-of-year programme, &quot;Top of the Pops Review of the Year 2022&quot;, was aired on Christmas Eve on BBC Two with Amfo returning as host alongside fellow Radio 1 DJ Jack Saunders. This format returned in 2023 and 2024, with Amfo hosting the reviews of the respective year.

====Comic Relief specials====
The show was given a one-off revival (of sorts) for Comic Relief 2007 in the form of &quot;Top Gear of the Pops&quot;, presented by Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May. It was filmed at the &quot;Top Gear&quot; aerodrome studio in Surrey on Sunday, 11 March 2007, although it bore little resemblance to the usual &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; format.

On 13 March 2009, &quot;Top of The Pops&quot; was once again revived, this time in its usual format, for a special live Comic Relief edition, airing on BBC Two while the main telethon took a break for the &quot;BBC News at Ten&quot; on BBC One. As with the Christmas specials the show was presented by Radio1 duo Fearne Cotton and Reggie Yates with special guest presenter Noel Fielding and appearances from Dawn French, Jennifer Saunders, Claudia Winkleman, Jonathan Ross, Davina McCall (dancing in the audience and later as a Flo Rida dancer with Claudia Winkleman and French and Saunders) and David Tennant.

Live performances – interspersed with Comic Relief appeal films – included acts such as Franz Ferdinand, Oasis, Take That, U2, James Morrison and Flo Rida (that week&#x27;s Number1). Kicking off the show was a performance from Rob Brydon and Ruth Jones in their Gavin &amp; Stacey guises, feat. Tom Jones and Robin Gibb with &quot;(Barry) Islands in the Stream&quot;, the Comic Relief single.

==Performers, performances and presenters==

In its extensive history, &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; has featured many artists, many of whom have appeared more than once on the show to promote many of their records.

Green Day hold the record for the longest &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; performance: &quot;Jesus of Suburbia&quot; broadcast on 6November 2005, lasted 9minutes and 10 seconds. There is uncertainty about what was the shortest performance. In 2005, presenter Reggie Yates announced on the show that it was Super Furry Animals with &quot;Do or Die&quot;, broadcast on 28 January 2000, clocking in at 95 seconds. However, &quot;It&#x27;s My Turn&quot; by Angelic was 91 seconds on 16 June 2000 and &quot;Here Comes the Summer&quot; by the Undertones was just 84 seconds on 26 July 1979.

Cliff Richard appeared the most times on the show, with almost 160 performances. Status Quo were the most frequent group with 106 performances.

===Miming===
Throughout the show&#x27;s history, many artists mimed to backing tracks. Early on, Musicians&#x27; Union rules required that groups re-record backing tracks with union members performing when possible. However, as &quot;The Guardian&quot; recounted in 2001: &quot;In practice, artists pretended to re-record the song, then used their original tapes.&quot;

The miming policy also led to the occasional technical hitch. In an August 1967 edition, as Jimi Hendrix prepared to perform &quot;Burning of the Midnight Lamp&quot;, the song &quot;The House That Jack Built&quot; by the Alan Price Set was played in studio instead, reportedly prompting Hendrix to respond: &quot;I don&#x27;t know the words to that one, man&quot;. In August 1988, All About Eve appeared to perform &quot;Martha&#x27;s Harbour&quot; on a live edition. Although the song was being played on the television broadcast, it was not being played in studio, so lead singer Julianne Regan remained silent on a stool on stage while Tim Bricheno (the only other band member present) did not play his guitar.

The producers of the show allowed artists the option of singing live over a backing track in 1991. Miming has resulted in a number of notable moments. In 1977, The Stranglers mimed to &quot;No More Heroes&quot; – after the start of the song, bass player Jean Jacques Burnel waves a newspaper to try and clear the smoke created from the smoke machines prior to the performance and, later, during his guitar solo Hugh Cornwell removes his hand from the guitar neck for a few seconds. In 1991, Nirvana refused to mime to the pre-recorded backing track of &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; with Kurt Cobain singing in a deliberately low voice and altering lyrics in the song, and bassist Krist Novoselic swinging his bass over his head and drummer Dave Grohl playing randomly on his kit. In 1995, the Gallagher brothers of Oasis switched places while performing &quot;Roll with It&quot;. During their performance of &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Me This Way&quot; the Communards singers Jimmy Somerville and Sarah Jane Morris swapped lyrics for part of the song towards the end. Another example of whimsy was John Peel&#x27;s appearance as the mandolin soloist for Rod Stewart on &quot;Maggie May&quot;. The new practice also exposed a number of poor live singers.

In its final few years miming had become less and less common, especially for bands, as studio technology became more reliable and artists were given the freedom to choose their performance style. Former Executive Producer Andi Peters said there was no policy on miming and that it was entirely up to the performer whether they wanted to sing live or mime.

===Orchestra and backing singers===
From 1966 to 1980, &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; had an in-studio orchestra conducted by Johnny Pearson accompany select musical performances, with The Ladybirds (later Maggie Stredder Singers) providing backing vocals. Credited on the show as musical associate, Derek Warne played piano and provided musical arrangements for the orchestra. As &quot;The Telegraph&quot; recounted, Pearson and the orchestra improvised accompaniments with about 20 minutes of rehearsal time per song, and the musicians, &quot;almost all middle-aged, often struggled with the enormous range of rock and pop tunes with which they were presented.&quot; In contrast, &quot;The Times&quot; said upon Pearson&#x27;s passing in 2011 that the orchestra &quot;often elicit[ed] excellent performances with barely enough time beforehand for a couple of run-throughs.&quot;

Other notable members of the orchestra include drummer Clem Cattini, trombonist Bobby Lamb, and lead trumpeters Leon Calvert and Ian Hamer. From 1971 to 1974, Martin Briley played guitar for the orchestra before joining rock group Greenslade.

Following the 1980 Musicians Union strike, the programme resumed broadcast on 7 August 1980 without its orchestra or backing singers. However, Pearson continued to make occasional contributions as musical director until the 900th episode in the summer of 1981. Afterwards, Warne occasionally made musical arrangements through April 1982. Ronnie Hazlehurst conducted the orchestra from 1982 to 1983.

===Promotional films and music videos===

In the 1960s and 1970s, the weekly record chart was published every Tuesday morning, and the live show was broadcast on Thursday evenings. This created a need for regular studio appearances by the top artists who often had hectic touring schedules that made it difficult for them to be present. As a result, the show&#x27;s production team faced a complex weekly planning process, involving rescheduling, booking, and rebooking of acts. To ensure that the show featured the top 20 artists of each week, particularly those from America who were expected to rise in the chart, pre-recording of performances became necessary. 

When an artist or group was unavailable to perform in studio, &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; would show a music video, pre-recorded videos known as &#x27;promotional films&#x27; at that time, in the acts&#x27; place. By the time the Beatles stopped touring in late 1966, their promotional films had become highly sophisticated. In May 1966 they filmed two sets of colour promotional clips for their current single &quot;Rain&quot; (also known as &quot;Paperback Writer&quot;) to air on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on 2 June. According to Queen guitarist Brian May, the groundbreaking 1975 music video for &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; was produced so that the band could avoid miming on TOTP since they would have looked off miming to such a complex song. This established the importance of promotional film clips as a means of promoting both emerging acts and new releases by established acts, which contributed to advent of the music video genre.

==Dance troupes==
===January to October 1964 – no dance troupes===
In the era before promotional videos were routinely produced for every charting single, the BBC would frequently have neither the band themselves nor alternative footage available for a song selected for the programme. In the first few months of the show in 1964, the director would just scan across the audience dancing in the absence of any other footage, but by October 1964 a decision was made to at least occasionally bring in a dance troupe with a choreographed routine to some of the tracks.

===November 1964 to April 1968 – The Go-Jos===

An initial candidate troupe was the existing BBC TV Beat Girls, but an ex-dancer from the Beat Girls, Jo Cook, was eventually engaged to create a troupe, the all-female Go-Jos, with Cook as choreographer. The Go-Jos also worked outside of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, notably for two years on the Val Doonican show – Doonican said in 1968 &quot;I thought the Gojos were fabulous, something really new. When I got my own television series I just had to have them with me.&quot;

They were initially a three-piece (Pat Hughes for the first edition only, Linda Hotchkin and Jane Bartlett), but their number eventually grew to six (Hotchkin, Bartlett, Lesley Larbey, Wendy Hilhouse, Barbara van der Heyde and Thelma Bignell) with Cook as full-time choreographer. Lulu remembered of their costumes &quot;They mostly wore white boots to the knee and short skirts and the camera would go up the skirt and it was all very risqué.&quot;

Cook herself said of working on the Doonican show (of which she was dance director) comparing to &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, &quot;Pop steps are limited... With Val we have more scope, and we can work to get more of the feel of ballet into our numbers.&quot;

===May to June 1968 – Go-Jos/Pan&#x27;s People transition===
In April 1968, a &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; choreographer, Virginia Mason, auditioned for dancers for a routine on &quot;Top of The Pops&quot; (&quot;Simon Says&quot; by the 1910 Fruitgum Company); two of whom that were successful (Ruth Pearson and Patricia &quot;Dee Dee&quot; Wilde) were part of the existing six-female dance troupe, Pan&#x27;s People. Like the Go-Jos, this group was also partly drawn from ex-members of the Beat Girls.

Although this routine did not make it onto the programme itself, in subsequent weeks, members of Pan&#x27;s People (Louise Clarke, Felicity &quot;Flick&quot; Colby, Barbara &quot;Babs&quot; Lord, Pearson, Andrea &quot;Andi&quot; Rutherford and Wilde) started to appear on the programme separately to the Go-Jos. Pan&#x27;s People were then selected by the BBC over the Go-Jos when they chose a group to be the resident troupe. The Go-Jos&#x27; final &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; performance was in June 1968 dancing to &quot;Jumping Jack Flash&quot; by the Rolling Stones.

===July 1968 to April 1976 – Pan&#x27;s People===
As with the Go-Jos, in the first eighteen months of the Pan&#x27;s People era the dancers were not a weekly fixture on the programme. However, due to group fan mail and good viewing figures, by 1970 the group was on nearly every week. Pay was not high – they were paid the minimum Equity rate of £56 per week.

One of the original Pan&#x27;s People dancers, Colby, became the full-time choreographer in 1971.
Colby spoke of the dancing – &quot;They weren&#x27;t Broadway-standard routines... we were definitely doing watercolours, not oil paintings.&quot;

===May to October 1976 – Ruby Flipper===
In early 1976, the last remaining of the early members of Pan&#x27;s People, Ruth Pearson announced her retirement, leaving just four members all of whom who had joined within the last four years; Cherry Gillespie, Mary Corpe, Lee Ward and Sue Menhenick. Rather than continue with this line up or add additional members, it was decided by Colby and BBC production staff to replace this group with a male and female group created for the programme, Ruby Flipper, choreographed by Colby and managed by Colby with Pearson. Lee Ward left shortly after this decision was made, reportedly saying regarding the change: &quot;It&#x27;s a big mistake. Men rush home to watch sexy ladies. They do not want to see other men.&quot;

Rehearsals for this new group started in March 1976, and the group began appearing on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in May 1976. Whilst producers were aware of the switch to the new group, Bill Cotton, the then head of the light entertainment unit of which &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; was part, was not. This group started as a seven-piece with three men (Gavin Trace, Floyd Pearce and Phil Steggles) and four women (Menhenick, Gillespie, Patti Hammond and Lulu Cartwright). Corpe was not invited to join the new troupe. Trace, Pearce, Steggles and Cartwright joined following open auditions, Hammond, an established dancer, was invited to join to complete the &quot;look&quot; following a later individual audition. Colby viewed this gender-mixed group as an opportunity to develop more physical routines including lifts, more duets and generally not have the whole group at each performance.

However, by August the BBC had decided to terminate the group due to perceived unpopularity and being &quot;...out of step with viewers&quot;. Their final appearance was in October 1976.

===November 1976 to November 1981 – Legs and Co===

The group created to replace Ruby Flipper was Legs &amp; Co, reverting to an all-female line-up, and once more choreographed by Colby. Three of the six in the initial line-up (Menhenick, Cartwight and Hammond) were taken from Ruby Flipper. with Rosie Hetherington, Gill Clarke and Pauline Peters making up the six. Despite being an all-female group, on occasion one or more male dancers were brought in, including Pearce several times.

During their run, the group covered the transition from Disco to Punk, Electronic and Modern Romantic music.

===December 1981 to September 1983 – Zoo===

By late 1981, Legs &amp; Co (by this time Anita Chellamah had replaced Peters) had become more integrated into the studio audience, rather than performing set-piece routines, as a result of the &#x27;party atmosphere&#x27; brought in by Michael Hurll. Also by this time Colby was particularly keen to work once more with male dancers; feeling it time for a change, Legs &amp; Co&#x27;s stint was ended, and a twenty-member dance troupe (ten male, ten female), named Zoo was created, with a set of performers drawn from the pool of twenty each week. Colby was now credited as &quot;Dance Director&quot;. Three members of previous troupes, Menhenick, Corpe and Chellamah, made at least one appearance each during the Zoo period. The dancers now chose their own clothes, moving away from the synchronised appearance of previous troupes.

===October 1983 to 2006 – After Zoo===
By the early 1980s, record companies were offering the BBC free promotional videos, meaning dance troupes no longer fulfilled their original purpose. Zoo&#x27;s run ended in 1983, and with it the use of dance troupes on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;.

After the demise of Zoo, the audience took a more active role, often dancing in more prominent areas such as behind performing acts on the back of the stage, and on podiums. However, the show also employed cheerleaders to lead the dancing.

==Lost episodes==
Due to the then standard practice of wiping videotape, the vast majority of the episodes from the programme&#x27;s history prior to 1976 are considered lost media, including any official recording of the only live appearance by the Beatles.

Of the first 500 episodes (1964–73), only about 20 complete recordings remain in the BBC archives, and the majority of these are from 1969 onwards. The earliest surviving footage dates from 26 February 1964, and consists of performances by Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas and the Dave Clark Five. Some programmes exist only partially (largely performances that were either pre-recorded or re-used in later, surviving editions). There are also two examples of rehearsal footage, both from 1965; one which includes Alan Freeman introducing the Seekers, and another with Sandie Shaw rehearsing &quot;Long Live Love&quot;—both believed to be for the end-of-year Christmas Special. The oldest complete episode in existence was originally transmitted on Boxing Day in 1967 (only five complete recordings from the 1960s survive, two of which have mute presenter links). The most recent that is not held in any form is dated 8September 1977. Most editions after this exist in full, though a number of episodes transmitted live during the 1980s were archived with slight technical issues (e.g. missing audio, typically restored by off-air recordings in repeats). One subsequent pre-recorded episode (dated 21 March 1985) from after is now believed to only exist as an off-air recording, and another later still from the 1990s (25 August 1994, hosted by Malcolm McLaren) appears to only exist in broadcast quality in raw, unedited master tape form similar to several earlier editions; both shows have been skipped in repeat airing runs.

The last thirteen minutes of the 19 August 1965 edition of TOTP survives, and features live performances from Herman&#x27;s Hermits, Sonny &amp; Cher, Jonathan King, and The Byrds.

Some off-air recordings, made by fans at home with a microphone in front of the TV speaker, exist in varying quality, including the Jimi Hendrix Experience performing a live version of &quot;Hey Joe&quot; in December 1966.

Some segments of &quot;TOTP&quot; which were not retained do survive in some form owing to having been included in other programmes, either by the BBC itself or by foreign broadcasters. What was thought to be the only surviving footage of the Beatles on the programme, for instance, comes from its re-use in episode one of 1965 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;The Chase&quot;. Additionally a number of recordings are believed to exist in private collections. However, in 2019, an 11-second clip of the group&#x27;s only live appearance on &quot;TOTP&quot;, from 16 June 1966, was unearthed – this was recorded by a viewer using an 8mm camera to film the live transmission on their television. Other individual but complete clips that have surfaced over recent years include The Hollies performing &quot;Bus Stop&quot;, and The Jimi Hendrix Experience playing both &quot;Purple Haze&quot; and &quot;The Wind Cries Mary&quot;.

Thanks to a deal between the BBC and German television network ZDF around the turn of the 1970s, several TOTP clips were sent over to be shown on &quot;Disco&quot;, a similar-styled chart show. This meant that performances from the likes of The Kinks (&quot;Apeman&quot;), The Who (&quot;The Seeker&quot;) and King Crimson (&quot;Cat Food&quot;) still exist in German archives.

Two complete episodes from 1967 were discovered in a private collection in 2009, having been recorded at home on an early available open reel to reel video recorder. Whilst the tapes suffered from major damage and degradation of both sound and picture quality, one show featured Pink Floyd with original leader Syd Barrett performing &quot;See Emily Play&quot;, whilst the second contained Dave Davies singing his solo hit &quot;Death of a Clown&quot;.

The programme was forced off the air for several weeks by industrial action by the Musicians&#x27; Union in both 1974 and 1980.

==Spin-offs==
&quot;Top of the Pops&quot; had a sister show called &quot;TOTP2&quot; which used archive footage from as early as the late 1960s. It began on 17 September 1994. The early series were narrated by Johnnie Walker, before Steve Wright took over as narrator. In summer 2004 BBC Two&#x27;s controller, Roly Keating, announced that it was being &quot;rested&quot;. Shortly after UKTV G2 began showing re-edited versions of earlier programmes with re-recorded dialogue. Finally after a two-year break &quot;TOTP2&quot; returned to the BBC Two schedules for a new series on Saturday, 30 September 2006, in an evening timeslot. It was still narrated by Steve Wright and featured a mixture of performances from the &quot;TOTP&quot; archive and newly recorded performances. The first edition of this series featured new performances by Razorlight and Nelly Furtado recorded after the final episode of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. In 2009 Mark Radcliffe took over as narrator. &quot;TOTP2&quot; continued to receive sporadic new episodes from this point onwards, most notably Christmas specials, until 2017 when the show ceased producing new episodes, though previous episodes are still repeated on both BBC Two and BBC Four.

Aired on BBC Radio 1 between the mid-1990s and late 2001 was &quot;Top of the Pops: The Radio Show&quot; which went out every Sunday at 3 pm just before the singles chart, and was presented by Jayne Middlemiss and Scott Mills. It later reappeared on the BBC World Service in May 2003 originally presented by Emma B, where it continues to be broadcast weekly in an hourly format, now presented by Kim Robson and produced by former BBC World Service producer Alan Rowett.

The defunct channel Play UK created two spin offs; &quot;TOTP+ Plus&quot; and &quot;TOTP@Play&quot; (2000–2001) (until mid-2000, this show was called &quot;The Phone Zone&quot; and was a spin-off from BBC Two music series &quot;The O-Zone&quot;). BBC Choice featured a show called &quot;TOTP The New Chart&quot; (5 December 1999 – 26 March 2000) and on BBC Two &quot;TOTP+&quot; (8 October 2000 – 26 August 2001) which featured the &quot;TOTP @ Play&quot; studio and presenters. This is not to be confused with the UK Play version of the same name. A more recent spin-off (now ended) was &quot;Top of the Pops Saturday&quot; hosted originally by Fearne Cotton and Simon Grant, and its successor &quot;Top of the Pops Reloaded&quot;. This was shown on Saturday mornings on BBC One and featured competitions, star interviews, video reviews and some &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; performances. This was aimed at a younger audience and was part of the CBBC Saturday morning line-up. This was to rival &quot;&quot; at the same time on ITV.

==Send-ups==
A number of performers have sent up the format in various ways. This was often by performers who disliked the mime format of the show, as a protest against this rather than simply refusing to appear.
* When the Smiths appeared on the show to perform their single &quot;This Charming Man&quot;, lead singer Morrissey was unhappy about having to lip-sync and so held a bunch of gladioli on the stage instead of a microphone.
* While performing their 1982 hit &quot;Jackie Wilson Said (I&#x27;m in Heaven When You Smile)&quot;, the band Dexys Midnight Runners were seen performing in front of a projection of the darts player with a similar sounding name (Jocky Wilson instead of soul singer Jackie Wilson). Dexys&#x27; frontman Kevin Rowland later said in an interview that the use of the Jocky Wilson picture was his idea and not a mistake by the programme makers as is sometimes stated.
* Frankie Goes To Hollywood performed one of the many 1984 performances of their hit &quot;Two Tribes&quot; with bassist Mark O&#x27;Toole playing drums whilst drummer Ped Gill played bass.
* In 1997 American band Eels appeared on the show, performing their hit &#x27;Novocaine For The Soul&#x27;. The band all mimed along with tiny miniature instruments, before smashing them up before the song had ended.
* When Oasis mimed to &quot;Whatever&quot; on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in 1994, one of the cello players from the symphony was replaced by rhythm guitarist Bonehead, who clearly had no idea how the instrument should be played. Towards the end of the song, he gave up the pretence and started using the bow to conduct. A woman plays his rhythm guitar.
* During Faith No More&#x27;s performance of &quot;From Out Of Nowhere&quot; in 1990, lead singer Mike Patton dribbles his lips during sections of the song instead of miming along.
* Singer Les Gray of Mud went on stage to perform with a ventriloquist dummy during the performance of &quot;Lonely This Christmas&quot; and had the dummy lip-synch to the voice-over in the middle of the song.
* EMF appeared on the show with one of the guitarists strumming along while wearing boxing gloves.
* In Blur&#x27;s performance of &quot;Charmless Man&quot; in 1996, Dave Rowntree decided to play with oversized drumsticks, while Graham Coxon played a mini guitar.
* In Green Day&#x27;s first &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; appearance in 1994, the band played the song &quot;Welcome to Paradise&quot;. Frontman Billie Joe Armstrong wore an otherwise plain white T-shirt with the phrase &quot;Who am I fooling anyway?&quot; handwritten on it, most likely a reference to his own miming during the performance. He could also be seen not playing his guitar during the instrumental bridge in the song.
* The performance of &quot;Maggie May&quot; by Rod Stewart and the Faces featured John Peel miming on mandolin. Near the end of the song, Rod and the Faces begin to kick around a football. This is despite the fact that the music can be still heard playing in the background.
* Ambient house group the Orb sat and played chess while an edited version of their 39:57-minute single &quot;Blue Room&quot; played in the background.
* Depeche Mode&#x27;s performance of &quot;Barrel of a Gun&quot; in 1997 featured Dutch photographer and director Anton Corbijn who mimed playing the drums. Also Tim Simenon (who produced the album the song appeared on) mimed playing keyboards along with Andy Fletcher.
* When the Cuban Boys performed &quot;Cognoscenti vs. Intelligentsia&quot; at the end of 1999, a performance which was reportedly unbroadcast, the band wearing labcoats, covered in cobwebs.

==International versions==
===Europe===

The &quot;TOTP&quot; format was sold to RTL in Germany in the 1990s, and aired on Saturday afternoons. It was very successful for a long time, with a compilation album series and magazine. However, in 2006 it was announced that the German show would be ending. The Italian version (first broadcast on Rai 2 and later on Italia 1) also ended in 2006. In February 2010 the show returned on Rai 2, and was broadcast for two seasons before being cancelled again in October 2011. The French version of the show ended by September 2006 on France 2. The short-lived Turkish version was aired on atv in 2000.

In the Netherlands, &quot;TopPop&quot; was broadcast by AVRO 1970–1988, and a version of the show continued to run on BNN until the end of December 2006. BBC Prime used to broadcast re-edited episodes of the BBC version, the weekend after it was transmitted in the UK. Ireland began transmitting &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in November 1978 on RTÉ2. This was the UK version being transmitted at the same time as on BBC. The broadcasts ceased in late 1993.

===United States===
&quot;Top of the Pops&quot; had short-lived fame in the United States. In October 1987, the CBS television network decided to try an American version of the show. It was hosted by Nia Peeples and even showed performances from the BBC version of the programme (and vice versa). The show was presented on late Friday nights as part of &quot;CBS Late Night&quot;, and lasted almost half a year. It was originally slated to be a first-run syndicated series, but it was changed when Lionheart Television, the show&#x27;s producers signed up with the network.

In 2002, BBC America presented the BBC version of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; as part of their weekend schedule. The network would get the episodes one week after they were transmitted in the UK. BBC America then tinkered with the show by cutting a few minutes out of each show and moving it to a weekday time slot.

On 23 January 2006, Lou Pearlman made a deal to bring &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; back to the airwaves in the United States. It was expected to be similar to the 1987 version, but it would also utilise the Billboard magazine music charts, most notably the Hot 100 chart. It was supposed to be planned for a possible 2006 or 2007 launch, but with several lawsuits against Lou and his companies (which resulted in his conviction in 2008), as well as the cancellation of the UK version, the proposed US project never went forward. On 19 August 2006, VH1 aired the UK series&#x27; final episode.

The United States had its own similar series, &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, which aired nationally on ABC from 1957 to 1987 (although it would continue in first-run syndication until 1988 and end its run on USA in 1989). Similar series also included &quot;Soul Train&quot; (1970–2006, featuring R&amp;B artists), &quot;Club MTV&quot; (1986–92, featuring dance music acts; hosted by Downtown Julie Brown, an alumnus of TOTP as part of the show&#x27;s last dance troupe Zoo) and &quot;Solid Gold&quot; (1980–88; like the early TOTP, it also used dance troupes).

===New Zealand===
The &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; brand has also been exported to New Zealand. Although the British show has been broadcast intermittently in New Zealand, the country historically relied on music video-based shows to demonstrate its own Top 20, as the major international acts, who dominated the local charts, considered New Zealand too small and remote to visit regularly. This changed to an extent in 2002, when the New Zealand government suggested a voluntary New Zealand music quota on radio (essentially a threat that if the stations did not impose a quota themselves then one would be imposed on them). The amount of local music played on radio stations increased, as did the number of local songs in the top 20. Therefore, a new local version of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; became feasible for the first time, and the show was commissioned by Television New Zealand.

The hour-long show (as opposed to the 30-minute UK version) which was broadcast at 5 pm on Saturdays on TV2 contained a mixture of performances recorded locally on a sound stage in the Auckland CBD, as well as performances from the international versions of the show. The New Zealand Top 20 singles and Top 10 albums charts were also featured. Despite having a sizeable fan base, in 2006 TVNZ announced that &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; had been cancelled.

Free-to-air music channel C4 then picked up the UK version of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; and aired it on Saturdays at 8 pm with a repeat screening on Thursdays. However, since the weekly UK version was discontinued itself, this arrangement also ended.

===Africa, Asia and the Middle East===
An edited version of the UK show was shown on BBC Prime, the weekend after UK transmission.

In addition, a licensed version was shown on the United Arab Emirates-based MBC1 television channel. This version consisted of parts of the UK version, including the Top 10 charts, as well as live performances by Arabic pop singers.

===Latin America===
A complete version of the UK show was shown on People+Arts, two weeks after the UK transmission.

==Compilation albums==
A number of compilation albums using the &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; brand have been issued over the years. The first one to reach the charts was &quot;BBC TV&#x27;s The Best of Top of the Pops&quot; on the Super Beeb record label in 1975, which reached number 21 and in 1986 the BBC released &quot;The Wizard&quot; by Paul Hardcastle (the 1986–1990 &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; theme tune) on vinyl under the BBC Records and Tapes banner.

Starting in 1968 and carrying on through the 1970s a rival series of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; albums were produced, however these had no connection with the television series except for its name. They were a series of budget cover albums of current chart hits recorded by anonymous session singers and musicians released on the Hallmark record label. They had initially reached the charts but were later disallowed due to a change in the criteria for entering the charts. These albums continued to be produced until the early 1980s, when the advent of compilation albums featuring the original versions of hits, such as the &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music!&quot; series, led to a steep decline in their popularity.

In the 1990s, the BBC &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; brand was again licensed for use in a tie-in compilation series. Starting in 1995 with Sony Music&#x27;s Columbia Records label, these double disc collections moved to the special marketing arm of PolyGram / Universal Music Group TV, before becoming a sister brand of the &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music!&quot; range in the EMI / Virgin / Universal joint venture.

Similarly to the roles of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on BBC One and BBC Two in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the compilation albums range featured current hits for the main series and classic hits (such as &#x27;70s Rock) for the &quot;Top of the Pops 2&quot; spin-offs.

The &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; brand has now been licensed by EMI who released a compilation series in 2007–08, with one CD for each year that &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; was running. The boxset for the entire series of 43 discs was released 7July 2008. A podcast supporting the release of the boxset featuring interviews with Mark Goodier, Miles Leonard, Malcolm McLaren and David Hepworth is available.

===Number One in the Compilation Charts===
These albums in the series reached No. 1:
* Top of the Pops 1 (Columbia Records, 1995)
* Top of the Pops &#x27;99 – Volume 2 (Universal Music TV, 1999)
* Top of the Pops 2000 – Volume Two (BBC Music / Universal Music TV, 2000)

==&quot;Top of the Pops&quot; magazine==
&quot;Top of the Pops&quot; magazine has been running since February 1995, and filled the void in the BBC magazine portfolio where &quot;Number One&quot; magazine used to be. It began much in the mould of &quot;Q&quot; magazine, then changed its editorial policy to directly compete with popular teen celebrity magazines such as &quot;Smash Hits&quot; and &quot;Big&quot;, with free sticker giveaways replacing Brett Anderson covers.

A July 1996 feature on the Spice Girls coined the famous &quot;Spice&quot; nicknames for each member (Baby, Ginger, Posh, Scary and Sporty) that stayed with them throughout their career as a group and beyond.

The BBC announced that the magazine would continue in publication despite the end of the television series, and is still running.

An earlier &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; magazine appeared briefly in the mid-1970s. Mud drummer Dave Mount sat reading an edition throughout a 1975 appearance on the show.

==&quot;Top of the Pops&quot; Awards==
The &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; Awards (also known as TOTP Awards) was an annual awards ceremony, with winners chosen by BBC One viewers, from 2001 to 2005. Hosted at the Manchester Arena, the awards was a collaboration between BBC and BBC Worldwide.

==In popular culture==

* The Number 6 track of the Kinks&#x27; 1970 eighth studio album &quot;Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One&quot; is called &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; and narrates the path to stardom by reaching Number1 in the music charts.
* Benny Hill performed a parody of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in January 1971 called &quot;Top of the Tops&quot;. It featured satires of many music acts at the time as well as impersonations and spoofed versions of both Jimmy Savile and Tony Blackburn.
* An episode of Emu&#x27;s Broadcasting Company featured a parody of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; called &quot;Top of the Flops&quot;, with Rod Hull, Emu and other cast members performing a song called &quot;Do the Emu&quot;.
* The Scottish punk band the Rezillos lampooned the show in their song &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. The band performed the song on the programme twice when it entered the charts in 1978.
* In 1984, British Rail HST power car 43002 was named Top of the Pops, by Jimmy Savile. This followed an edition which was broadcast live on a train, which 43002 was one of the power cars for. The nameplates were removed in 1989.
* The Smashie and Nicey 1994 TV special &quot;Smashie and Nicey: The End of an Era&quot; featured doctored and recreated footage of the two fictional DJs hosting a montage of 1970s editions of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, including a &quot;Black music&quot; edition, which the pair presented in Blackface.
* In the opening credits of the Spice Girls&#x27; 1997 feature film &quot;&quot;, the girls perform their hit single &quot;Too Much&quot; on a fictional episode of the show. They also performed it on the show in real life when it became their second Christmas number one in the UK that same year.
* A 2001 episode of &quot;Tweenies&quot; featured a parody of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, complete with Max imitating Jimmy Savile. The episode was unintentionally repeated in January 2013, and received 216 complaints.
* A &quot;Newzoids&quot; sketch has the Twelfth Doctor (and a future version of himself) escape the new era of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, and travel back to the 1970s. However, the two Doctors are soon horrified to realize that being at the BBC in the 1970s means that they are next door to the &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; studio, and flee into the future. A terrified Dalek begs them to &quot;Take me with you. Take me with you&quot;.

==Licensing==
In May 2006, following a special Red Hot Chili Peppers concert recorded in the car park of BBC Television Centre, Hammersmith and Fulham Council (which governs the area the centre is located) informed the BBC that it lacked the necessary public entertainment licence (as required by the Licensing Act 2003). Until the BBC could obtain the licence, BBC staff stood-in as audience members for live music programmes.

==VHSs and DVDs==
In 2002, a crossover direct-to-video VHS was released between &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; and &quot;Tweenies&quot;, containing footage taken from the episodes where the Tweenies themselves had performed on the show, which the characters watched on a TV screen at their playgroup.

In 2004 there was a DVD released called &quot;Top of the Pops 40th Anniversary 1964–2004 DVD&quot;. It features live performances, containing one song for each year, except 1966. (Two tracks from 1965 are featured instead). Also included as extras are seven opening titles, most notably the one with the flying coloured LP&#x27;s from 1981. This title sequence had Phil Lynott&#x27;s song &quot;Yellow Pearl&quot; as the theme. The 1986 and 1989 titles are also featured, with Paul Hardcastle&#x27;s hit &quot;The Wizard&quot; as the theme. This DVD was to celebrate 40 years since the show started.

There was also a DVD quiz released in 2007 called &quot;The Essential Music Quiz&quot;. There was also a DVD in 2001 called &quot;Summer 2001&quot;, a sister DVD to the album of the same name.

<text>Eiffel 65 is an Italian Eurodance group formed in 1997 in the studios of the Turin based record company Bliss Corporation. The group consists of Jeffrey Jey, Maurizio Lobina, and formerly Gabry Ponte. They gained global popularity with their singles &quot;Blue (Da Ba Dee)&quot; and &quot;Move Your Body&quot; from their 1999 debut studio album &quot;Europop&quot;. The singles reached number one in many countries, while the album peaked at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. Their following two albums, &quot;Contact!&quot; (2001) and their self-titled &quot;Eiffel 65&quot; (2003), did not gain international success, but still managed to gain success in Italy.

Throughout their career, the group won a World Music Award in 2000 for the World Best Selling Italian Group, and a B.M.I USA in Los Angeles, rewarding the most-broadcast song on radio in the United States. They were also nominated at the Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording for &quot;Blue (Da Ba Dee)&quot;.

Eiffel 65 also produced remixes of numerous popular songs, and they recorded &quot;One Goal&quot;, one of the official songs of the UEFA Euro 2000, and &quot;Living in My City&quot; for the 2006 Winter Olympics. With more than 20 million copies sold and many gold, platinum and diamond records, it is one of Italy&#x27;s most popular electronic groups.

In 2005, Ponte focused on his solo career, and then Jey and Lobina collaborated as a duo called Bloom 06. In 2010, the original group reunited, although Ponte no longer participates.

==History==
===1992: Formation===
Randone, Ponte and Lobina met at Bliss Corporation, which was founded in 1992 by Massimo Gabutti. A computer chose the name &quot;Eiffel&quot; randomly from a group of words the three had selected but the number &quot;65&quot; was added to it by mistake: the producer had written a phone number on a piece of paper and two digits of it ended up on the label copy. The graphic artist who received it assumed that it had been added afterwards so he just fused it to the band name for their first release.

===1992–2000: Breakthrough with &quot;Europop&quot;===
Eiffel 65 became famous for their international chart-topping hits &quot;Blue (Da Ba Dee)&quot; and &quot;Move Your Body&quot;. Both songs were featured singles on their debut album &quot;Europop&quot;, which was released on 22 November 1999.

The band achieved considerable success in Italy and the rest of Europe, in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Brazil. &quot;Europop&quot; peaked in the top five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Canadian Albums chart. &quot;Blue (Da Ba Dee)&quot; peaked at number 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, reached No. 1 in the UK and in Germany and number 3 in Italy.

=== 2001–2005: Follow-up albums ===
Their second album, &quot;Contact!&quot;, was released in 2001, with &quot;&#x27;80s Stars&quot; peaking at No. 9 in Italy. A self-titled &quot;Eiffel 65&quot; album was released in 2003.

Eiffel 65 also remixed, between 1999 and 2002, other artists&#x27; tracks like the Bloodhound Gang&#x27;s &quot;The Bad Touch&quot;, Nek&#x27;s &quot;La vita è&quot;, S Club 7&#x27;s &quot;Reach&quot; and in early 2005, a remix of Yo Yo Mundi&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;ultimo testimone&quot;.

===2005–2010: Bloom 06 and &quot;Crash Test 01&quot;===

In early March 2005, the group&#x27;s DJ, Gabry Ponte, went on to focus on his solo career. On 16 May 2005, the other two members, Maurizio Lobina and Jeffrey Jey, decided to leave Bliss Corporation to continue with their own production company. Since the name &quot;Eiffel 65&quot; was a property of Bliss Corporation, the duo decided to continue under a new name, as announced in June 2005, Bloom 06.

Eiffel 65&#x27;s long-anticipated fourth album, under the working title &quot;Crash Test&quot;, had already finished production by the time of Maury and Jeffrey&#x27;s departure from Bliss Corporation. It was renamed &quot;Crash Test 01&quot; and was released by Bloom 06 on 13 October 2006. The album contains lyrics in English and Italian.

===2010–present: Reunion and recent work===

Bliss Corporation confirmed that a new Eiffel 65 lineup would make their debut in the summer of 2007 but the debut was postponed. In 2009, Bliss Corporation began to promote work from older bands by subtitling music videos and releasing &quot;unseen&quot; video footage from Eiffel 65. In June 2010, it was announced on the Bloom 06 website that Eiffel 65 would reunite once again to produce new music as well as touring. In an April 2012 interview, Jeffrey Jey commented on the progress of the new album:


In the meantime, they toured Europe with their New Planet Tour, a multimedia show with wide screens, and in the summer of 2012, they announced a mini tour in Australia on their site.

On 2 April 2016, a demo of Eiffel 65&#x27;s new single &quot;Panico&quot; was posted on Bliss Corporation&#x27;s YouTube channel. &quot;Panico&quot; and its English version &quot;Critical&quot; were officially released on iTunes on 1 June 2016. However, their fourth album release date is still unknown.

In late February 2023, the group appeared on the list of artists who will compete in &quot;Una Voce Per San Marino&quot;, a song contest where the winning song will represent San Marino at the Eurovision Song Contest 2023 in Liverpool.

In May 2024, they released a new single &quot;Bestiale&quot; with Italian singer Loredana Bertè.

==Zorotl==
Zorotlekuykauo &quot;Zorotl&quot; Sushik IV is a character created by the Bliss Corporation and featured in the videos of &quot;Blue (Da Ba Dee)&quot;, &quot;Move Your Body&quot; and &quot;Lucky (In My Life)&quot;. Zorotl was supposed to be a malicious character but since he was designed with a funny round body, the authors of the &quot;Blue (Da Ba Dee)&quot; video decided to portray it as tender, changing the script and giving it a happy ending. In 2000, Bliss Corporation made a video for the unreleased Eiffel 65 song &quot;I Wanna Be&quot;. An alpha version of the video appeared as enhanced content for Eiffel 65&#x27;s single &quot;Too Much of Heaven&quot;. The song is credited to Zorotl even though it was recorded by members of Eiffel 65, so Zorotl is considered a virtual group.

<text>Advanced Video Coding (AVC), also referred to as H.264 or MPEG-4 Part 10, is a video compression standard based on block-oriented, motion-compensated coding. It is by far the most commonly used format for the recording, compression, and distribution of video content, used by 91% of video industry developers . It supports a maximum resolution of 8K UHD.

The intent of the H.264/AVC project was to create a standard capable of providing good video quality at substantially lower bit rates than previous standards (i.e., half or less the bit rate of MPEG-2, H.263, or MPEG-4 Part 2), without increasing the complexity of design so much that it would be impractical or excessively expensive to implement. This was achieved with features such as a reduced-complexity integer discrete cosine transform (integer DCT), variable block-size segmentation, and multi-picture inter-picture prediction. An additional goal was to provide enough flexibility to allow the standard to be applied to a wide variety of applications on a wide variety of networks and systems, including low and high bit rates, low and high resolution video, broadcast, DVD storage, RTP/IP packet networks, and ITU-T multimedia telephony systems. The H.264 standard can be viewed as a &quot;family of standards&quot; composed of a number of different profiles, although its &quot;High profile&quot; is by far the most commonly used format. A specific decoder decodes at least one, but not necessarily all profiles. The standard describes the format of the encoded data and how the data is decoded, but it does not specify algorithms for encoding video that is left open as a matter for encoder designers to select for themselves, and a wide variety of encoding schemes have been developed. H.264 is typically used for lossy compression, although it is also possible to create truly lossless-coded regions within lossy-coded pictures or to support rare use cases for which the entire encoding is lossless.

H.264 was standardized by the ITU-T Video Coding Experts Group (VCEG) of Study Group 16 together with the ISO/IEC JTC 1 Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG). The project partnership effort is known as the Joint Video Team (JVT). The ITU-T H.264 standard and the ISO/IEC MPEG-4 AVC standard (formally, ISO/IEC 14496-10 – MPEG-4 Part 10, Advanced Video Coding) are jointly maintained so that they have identical technical content. The final drafting work on the first version of the standard was completed in May 2003, and various extensions of its capabilities have been added in subsequent editions. High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC), a.k.a. H.265 and MPEG-H Part 2 is a successor to H.264/MPEG-4 AVC developed by the same organizations, while earlier standards are still in common use.

H.264 is perhaps best known as being the most commonly used video encoding format on Blu-ray Discs. It is also widely used by streaming Internet sources, such as videos from Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Vimeo, YouTube, and the iTunes Store, Web software such as the Adobe Flash Player and Microsoft Silverlight, and also various HDTV broadcasts over terrestrial (ATSC, ISDB-T, DVB-T or DVB-T2), cable (DVB-C), and satellite (DVB-S and DVB-S2) systems.

H.264 is restricted by patents owned by various parties. A license covering most (but not all) patents essential to H.264 is administered by a patent pool formerly administered by MPEG LA. Via Licensing Corp acquired MPEG LA in April 2023 and formed a new patent pool administration company called Via Licensing Alliance. The commercial use of patented H.264 technologies requires the payment of royalties to Via and other patent owners. MPEG LA has allowed the free use of H.264 technologies for streaming Internet video that is free to end users, and Cisco paid royalties to MPEG LA on behalf of the users of binaries for its open source H.264 encoder openH264.

== Naming ==
The H.264 name follows the ITU-T naming convention, where Recommendations are given a letter corresponding to their series and a recommendation number within the series. H.264 is part of &quot;H-Series Recommendations: Audiovisual and multimedia systems&quot;. H.264 is further categorized into &quot;H.200-H.499: Infrastructure of audiovisual services&quot; and &quot;H.260-H.279: Coding of moving video&quot;. The MPEG-4 AVC name relates to the naming convention in ISO/IEC MPEG, where the standard is part 10 of ISO/IEC 14496, which is the suite of standards known as MPEG-4. The standard was developed jointly in a partnership of VCEG and MPEG, after earlier development work in the ITU-T as a VCEG project called H.26L. It is thus common to refer to the standard with names such as H.264/AVC, AVC/H.264, H.264/MPEG-4 AVC, or MPEG-4/H.264 AVC, to emphasize the common heritage. Occasionally, it is also referred to as &quot;the JVT codec&quot;, in reference to the Joint Video Team (JVT) organization that developed it. (Such partnership and multiple naming is not uncommon. For example, the video compression standard known as MPEG-2 also arose from the partnership between MPEG and the ITU-T, where MPEG-2 video is known to the ITU-T community as H.262.) Some software programs (such as VLC media player) internally identify this standard as AVC1.

== History ==
=== Overall history ===
In early 1998, the Video Coding Experts Group (VCEG – ITU-T SG16 Q.6) issued a call for proposals on a project called H.26L, with the target to double the coding efficiency (which means halving the bit rate necessary for a given level of fidelity) in comparison to any other existing video coding standards for a broad variety of applications. VCEG was chaired by Gary Sullivan (Microsoft, formerly PictureTel, U.S.). The first draft design for that new standard was adopted in August 1999. In 2000, Thomas Wiegand (Heinrich Hertz Institute, Germany) became VCEG co-chair.

In December 2001, VCEG and the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG – ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29/WG 11) formed a Joint Video Team (JVT), with the charter to finalize the video coding standard. Formal approval of the specification came in March 2003. The JVT was (is) chaired by Gary Sullivan, Thomas Wiegand, and Ajay Luthra (Motorola, U.S.: later Arris, U.S.). In July 2004, the Fidelity Range Extensions (FRExt) project was finalized. From January 2005 to November 2007, the JVT was working on an extension of H.264/AVC towards scalability by an Annex (G) called Scalable Video Coding (SVC). The JVT management team was extended by Jens-Rainer Ohm (RWTH Aachen University, Germany). From July 2006 to November 2009, the JVT worked on Multiview Video Coding (MVC), an extension of H.264/AVC towards 3D television and limited-range free-viewpoint television. That work included the development of two new profiles of the standard: the Multiview High Profile and the Stereo High Profile.

Throughout the development of the standard, additional messages for containing supplemental enhancement information (SEI) have been developed. SEI messages can contain various types of data that indicate the timing of the video pictures or describe various properties of the coded video or how it can be used or enhanced. SEI messages are also defined that can contain arbitrary user-defined data. SEI messages do not affect the core decoding process, but can indicate how the video is recommended to be post-processed or displayed. Some other high-level properties of the video content are conveyed in video usability information (VUI), such as the indication of the color space for interpretation of the video content. As new color spaces have been developed, such as for high dynamic range and wide color gamut video, additional VUI identifiers have been added to indicate them.

=== Fidelity range extensions and professional profiles ===
The standardization of the first version of H.264/AVC was completed in May 2003. In the first project to extend the original standard, the JVT then developed what was called the Fidelity Range Extensions (FRExt). These extensions enabled higher quality video coding by supporting increased sample bit depth precision and higher-resolution color information, including the sampling structures known as Y′CBCR 4:2:2 (a.k.a. YUV 4:2:2) and 4:4:4. Several other features were also included in the FRExt project, such as adding an 8×8 integer discrete cosine transform (integer DCT) with adaptive switching between the 4×4 and 8×8 transforms, encoder-specified perceptual-based quantization weighting matrices, efficient inter-picture lossless coding, and support of additional color spaces. The design work on the FRExt project was completed in July 2004, and the drafting work on them was completed in September 2004.

Five other new profiles (see version 7 below) intended primarily for professional applications were then developed, adding extended-gamut color space support, defining additional aspect ratio indicators, defining two additional types of &quot;supplemental enhancement information&quot; (post-filter hint and tone mapping), and deprecating one of the prior FRExt profiles (the High 4:4:4 profile) that industry feedback indicated should have been designed differently.

=== Scalable video coding ===
The next major feature added to the standard was Scalable Video Coding (SVC). Specified in Annex G of H.264/AVC, SVC allows the construction of bitstreams that contain &quot;layers&quot; of sub-bitstreams that also conform to the standard, including one such bitstream known as the &quot;base layer&quot; that can be decoded by a H.264/AVC codec that does not support SVC. For temporal bitstream scalability (i.e., the presence of a sub-bitstream with a smaller temporal sampling rate than the main bitstream), complete access units are removed from the bitstream when deriving the sub-bitstream. In this case, high-level syntax and inter-prediction reference pictures in the bitstream are constructed accordingly. On the other hand, for spatial and quality bitstream scalability (i.e. the presence of a sub-bitstream with lower spatial resolution/quality than the main bitstream), the NAL (Network Abstraction Layer) is removed from the bitstream when deriving the sub-bitstream. In this case, inter-layer prediction (i.e., the prediction of the higher spatial resolution/quality signal from the data of the lower spatial resolution/quality signal) is typically used for efficient coding. The Scalable Video Coding extensions were completed in November 2007.

=== Multiview video coding ===
The next major feature added to the standard was Multiview Video Coding (MVC). Specified in Annex H of H.264/AVC, MVC enables the construction of bitstreams that represent more than one view of a video scene. An important example of this functionality is stereoscopic 3D video coding. Two profiles were developed in the MVC work: Multiview High profile supports an arbitrary number of views, and Stereo High profile is designed specifically for two-view stereoscopic video. The Multiview Video Coding extensions were completed in November 2009.

=== 3D-AVC and MFC stereoscopic coding ===
Additional extensions were later developed that included 3D video coding with joint coding of depth maps and texture (termed 3D-AVC), multi-resolution frame-compatible (MFC) stereoscopic and 3D-MFC coding, various additional combinations of features, and higher frame sizes and frame rates.

=== Versions ===

== Applications ==

The H.264 video format has a very broad application range that covers all forms of digital compressed video from low bit-rate Internet streaming applications to HDTV broadcast and Digital Cinema applications with nearly lossless coding. With the use of H.264, bit rate savings of 50% or more compared to MPEG-2 Part 2 are reported. For example, H.264 has been reported to give the same Digital Satellite TV quality as current MPEG-2 implementations with less than half the bitrate, with current MPEG-2 implementations working at around 3.5 Mbit/s and H.264 at only 1.5 Mbit/s. Sony claims that 9 Mbit/s AVC recording mode is equivalent to the image quality of the HDV format, which uses approximately 18–25 Mbit/s.

To ensure compatibility and problem-free adoption of H.264/AVC, many standards bodies have amended or added to their video-related standards so that users of these standards can employ H.264/AVC. Both the Blu-ray Disc format and the now-discontinued HD DVD format include the H.264/AVC High Profile as one of three mandatory video compression formats. The Digital Video Broadcast project (DVB) approved the use of H.264/AVC for broadcast television in late 2004.

The Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) standards body in the United States approved the use of H.264/AVC for broadcast television in July 2008, although the standard is not yet used for fixed ATSC broadcasts within the United States. It has also been approved for use with the more recent ATSC-M/H (Mobile/Handheld) standard, using the AVC and SVC portions of H.264.

The closed-circuit-television and video-surveillance markets have included the technology in many products.

Many common DSLRs use H.264 video wrapped in QuickTime MOV containers as the native recording format.

=== Derived formats ===
AVCHD is a high-definition recording format designed by Sony and Panasonic that uses H.264 (conforming to H.264 while adding additional application-specific features and constraints).

AVC-Intra is an intraframe-only compression format, developed by Panasonic.

XAVC is a recording format designed by Sony that uses level 5.2 of H.264/MPEG-4 AVC, which is the highest level supported by that video standard. XAVC can support 4K resolution (4096 × 2160 and 3840 × 2160) at up to 60 frames per second (fps). Sony has announced that cameras that support XAVC include two CineAlta cameras—the Sony PMW-F55 and Sony PMW-F5. The Sony PMW-F55 can record XAVC with 4K resolution at 30 fps at 300 Mbit/s and 2K resolution at 30 fps at 100 Mbit/s. XAVC can record 4K resolution at 60 fps with 4:2:2 chroma sampling at 600 Mbit/s.

=== Features ===

H.264/AVC/MPEG-4 Part 10 contains a number of new features that allow it to compress video much more efficiently than older standards and to provide more flexibility for application to a wide variety of network environments. In particular, some such key features include:

* Multi-picture inter-picture prediction including the following features:
** Using previously encoded pictures as references in a much more flexible way than in past standards, allowing up to 16 reference frames (or 32 reference fields, in the case of interlaced encoding) to be used in some cases. In profiles that support non-IDR frames, most levels specify that sufficient buffering should be available to allow for at least 4 or 5 reference frames at maximum resolution. This is in contrast to prior standards, where the limit was typically one; or, in the case of conventional &quot;B pictures&quot; (B-frames), two.
** Variable block-size motion compensation (VBSMC) with block sizes as large as 16×16 and as small as 4×4, enabling precise segmentation of moving regions. The supported luma prediction block sizes include 16×16, 16×8, 8×16, 8×8, 8×4, 4×8, and 4×4, many of which can be used together in a single macroblock. Chroma prediction block sizes are correspondingly smaller when chroma subsampling is used.
** The ability to use multiple motion vectors per macroblock (one or two per partition) with a maximum of 32 in the case of a B macroblock constructed of 16 4×4 partitions. The motion vectors for each 8×8 or larger partition region can point to different reference pictures.
** The ability to use any macroblock type in B-frames, including I-macroblocks, resulting in much more efficient encoding when using B-frames. This feature was notably left out from MPEG-4 ASP.
** Six-tap filtering for derivation of half-pel luma sample predictions, for sharper subpixel motion-compensation. Quarter-pixel motion is derived by linear interpolation of the halfpixel values, to save processing power.
** Quarter-pixel precision for motion compensation, enabling precise description of the displacements of moving areas. For chroma the resolution is typically halved both vertically and horizontally (see 4:2:0) therefore the motion compensation of chroma uses one-eighth chroma pixel grid units.
** Weighted prediction, allowing an encoder to specify the use of a scaling and offset when performing motion compensation, and providing a significant benefit in performance in special cases—such as fade-to-black, fade-in, and cross-fade transitions. This includes implicit weighted prediction for B-frames, and explicit weighted prediction for P-frames.
* Spatial prediction from the edges of neighboring blocks for &quot;intra&quot; coding, rather than the &quot;DC&quot;-only prediction found in MPEG-2 Part 2 and the transform coefficient prediction found in H.263v2 and MPEG-4 Part 2. This includes luma prediction block sizes of 16×16, 8×8, and 4×4 (of which only one type can be used within each macroblock).
* Integer discrete cosine transform (integer DCT), a type of discrete cosine transform (DCT) where the transform is an integer approximation of the standard DCT. It has selectable block sizes and exact-match integer computation to reduce complexity, including:
** An exact-match integer 4×4 spatial block transform, allowing precise placement of residual signals with little of the &quot;ringing&quot; often found with prior codec designs. It is similar to the standard DCT used in previous standards, but uses a smaller block size and simple integer processing. Unlike the cosine-based formulas and tolerances expressed in earlier standards (such as H.261 and MPEG-2), integer processing provides an exactly specified decoded result.
** An exact-match integer 8×8 spatial block transform, allowing highly correlated regions to be compressed more efficiently than with the 4×4 transform. This design is based on the standard DCT, but simplified and made to provide exactly specified decoding.
** Adaptive encoder selection between the 4×4 and 8×8 transform block sizes for the integer transform operation.
** A secondary Hadamard transform performed on &quot;DC&quot; coefficients of the primary spatial transform applied to chroma DC coefficients (and also luma in one special case) to obtain even more compression in smooth regions.
* Lossless macroblock coding features including:
** A lossless &quot;PCM macroblock&quot; representation mode in which video data samples are represented directly, allowing perfect representation of specific regions and allowing a strict limit to be placed on the quantity of coded data for each macroblock.
** An enhanced lossless macroblock representation mode allowing perfect representation of specific regions while ordinarily using substantially fewer bits than the PCM mode.
* Flexible interlaced-scan video coding features, including:
** Macroblock-adaptive frame-field (MBAFF) coding, using a macroblock pair structure for pictures coded as frames, allowing 16×16 macroblocks in field mode (compared with MPEG-2, where field mode processing in a picture that is coded as a frame results in the processing of 16×8 half-macroblocks).
** Picture-adaptive frame-field coding (PAFF or PicAFF) allowing a freely selected mixture of pictures coded either as complete frames where both fields are combined for encoding or as individual single fields.
* A quantization design including:
** Logarithmic step size control for easier bit rate management by encoders and simplified inverse-quantization scaling
** Frequency-customized quantization scaling matrices selected by the encoder for perceptual-based quantization optimization
* An in-loop deblocking filter that helps prevent the blocking artifacts common to other DCT-based image compression techniques, resulting in better visual appearance and compression efficiency
* An entropy coding design including:
** Context-adaptive binary arithmetic coding (CABAC), an algorithm to losslessly compress syntax elements in the video stream knowing the probabilities of syntax elements in a given context. CABAC compresses data more efficiently than CAVLC but requires considerably more processing to decode.
** Context-adaptive variable-length coding (CAVLC), which is a lower-complexity alternative to CABAC for the coding of quantized transform coefficient values. Although lower complexity than CABAC, CAVLC is more elaborate and more efficient than the methods typically used to code coefficients in other prior designs.
** A common simple and highly structured variable length coding (VLC) technique for many of the syntax elements not coded by CABAC or CAVLC, referred to as Exponential-Golomb coding (or Exp-Golomb).
* Loss resilience features including:
** A Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) definition allowing the same video syntax to be used in many network environments. One very fundamental design concept of H.264 is to generate self-contained packets, to remove the header duplication as in MPEG-4&#x27;s Header Extension Code (HEC). This was achieved by decoupling information relevant to more than one slice from the media stream. The combination of the higher-level parameters is called a parameter set. The H.264 specification includes two types of parameter sets: Sequence Parameter Set (SPS) and Picture Parameter Set (PPS). An active sequence parameter set remains unchanged throughout a coded video sequence, and an active picture parameter set remains unchanged within a coded picture. The sequence and picture parameter set structures contain information such as picture size, optional coding modes employed, and macroblock to slice group map.
** Flexible macroblock ordering (FMO), also known as slice groups, and arbitrary slice ordering (ASO), which are techniques for restructuring the ordering of the representation of the fundamental regions (&quot;macroblocks&quot;) in pictures. Typically considered an error/loss robustness feature, FMO and ASO can also be used for other purposes.
** Data partitioning (DP), a feature providing the ability to separate more important and less important syntax elements into different packets of data, enabling the application of unequal error protection (UEP) and other types of improvement of error/loss robustness.
** Redundant slices (RS), an error/loss robustness feature that lets an encoder send an extra representation of a picture region (typically at lower fidelity) that can be used if the primary representation is corrupted or lost.
** Frame numbering, a feature that allows the creation of &quot;sub-sequences&quot;, enabling temporal scalability by optional inclusion of extra pictures between other pictures, and the detection and concealment of losses of entire pictures, which can occur due to network packet losses or channel errors.
* Switching slices, called SP and SI slices, allowing an encoder to direct a decoder to jump into an ongoing video stream for such purposes as video streaming bit rate switching and &quot;trick mode&quot; operation. When a decoder jumps into the middle of a video stream using the SP/SI feature, it can get an exact match to the decoded pictures at that location in the video stream despite using different pictures, or no pictures at all, as references prior to the switch.
* A simple automatic process for preventing the accidental emulation of start codes, which are special sequences of bits in the coded data that allow random access into the bitstream and recovery of byte alignment in systems that can lose byte synchronization.
* Supplemental enhancement information (SEI) and video usability information (VUI), which are extra information that can be inserted into the bitstream for various purposes such as indicating the color space used the video content or various constraints that apply to the encoding. SEI messages can contain arbitrary user-defined metadata payloads or other messages with syntax and semantics defined in the standard.
* Auxiliary pictures, which can be used for such purposes as alpha compositing.
* Support of monochrome (4:0:0), 4:2:0, 4:2:2, and 4:4:4 chroma sampling (depending on the selected profile).
* Support of sample bit depth precision ranging from 8 to 14 bits per sample (depending on the selected profile).
* The ability to encode individual color planes as distinct pictures with their own slice structures, macroblock modes, motion vectors, etc., allowing encoders to be designed with a simple parallelization structure (supported only in the three 4:4:4-capable profiles).
* Picture order count, a feature that serves to keep the ordering of the pictures and the values of samples in the decoded pictures isolated from timing information, allowing timing information to be carried and controlled/changed separately by a system without affecting decoded picture content.

These techniques, along with several others, help H.264 to perform significantly better than any prior standard under a wide variety of circumstances in a wide variety of application environments. H.264 can often perform radically better than MPEG-2 video—typically obtaining the same quality at half of the bit rate or less, especially on high bit rate and high resolution video content.

Like other ISO/IEC MPEG video standards, H.264/AVC has a reference software implementation that can be freely downloaded. Its main purpose is to give examples of H.264/AVC features, rather than being a useful application &quot;per se&quot;. Some reference hardware design work has also been conducted in the Moving Picture Experts Group.
The above-mentioned aspects include features in all profiles of H.264. A profile for a codec is a set of features of that codec identified to meet a certain set of specifications of intended applications. This means that many of the features listed are not supported in some profiles. Various profiles of H.264/AVC are discussed in next section.

=== Profiles ===
The standard defines several sets of capabilities, which are referred to as &quot;profiles&quot;, targeting specific classes of applications. These are declared using a profile code (profile_idc) and sometimes a set of additional constraints applied in the encoder. The profile code and indicated constraints allow a decoder to recognize the requirements for decoding that specific bitstream. (And in many system environments, only one or two profiles are allowed to be used, so decoders in those environments do not need to be concerned with recognizing the less commonly used profiles.) By far the most commonly used profile is the High Profile.

Profiles for non-scalable 2D video applications include the following:

;Constrained Baseline Profile (CBP, 66 with constraint set 1): Primarily for low-cost applications, this profile is most typically used in videoconferencing and mobile applications. It corresponds to the subset of features that are in common between the Baseline, Main, and High Profiles.
;Baseline Profile (BP, 66): Primarily for low-cost applications that require additional data loss robustness, this profile is used in some videoconferencing and mobile applications. This profile includes all features that are supported in the Constrained Baseline Profile, plus three additional features that can be used for loss robustness (or for other purposes such as low-delay multi-point video stream compositing). The importance of this profile has faded somewhat since the definition of the Constrained Baseline Profile in 2009. All Constrained Baseline Profile bitstreams are also considered to be Baseline Profile bitstreams, as these two profiles share the same profile identifier code value.
;Extended Profile (XP, 88): Intended as the streaming video profile, this profile has relatively high compression capability and some extra tricks for robustness to data losses and server stream switching.
;Main Profile (MP, 77): This profile is used for standard-definition digital TV broadcasts that use the MPEG-4 format as defined in the DVB standard. It is not, however, used for high-definition television broadcasts, as the importance of this profile faded when the High Profile was developed in 2004 for that application.
;High Profile (HiP, 100): The primary profile for broadcast and disc storage applications, particularly for high-definition television applications (for example, this is the profile adopted by the Blu-ray Disc storage format and the DVB HDTV broadcast service).
;Progressive High Profile (PHiP, 100 with constraint set 4): Similar to the High profile, but without support of field coding features.
;Constrained High Profile (100 with constraint set 4 and 5): Similar to the Progressive High profile, but without support of B (bi-predictive) slices.
;High 10 Profile (Hi10P, 110): Going beyond typical mainstream consumer product capabilities, this profile builds on top of the High Profile, adding support for up to 10 bits per sample of decoded picture precision.
;High 422 Profile (Hi422P, 122): Primarily targeting professional applications that use interlaced video, this profile builds on top of the High 10 Profile, adding support for the 4:2:2 chroma sampling format while using up to 10 bits per sample of decoded picture precision.
;High 444 Predictive Profile (Hi444PP, 244): This profile builds on top of the High 4:2:2 Profile, supporting up to 4:4:4 chroma sampling, up to 14 bits per sample, and additionally supporting efficient lossless region coding and the coding of each picture as three separate color planes.

For camcorders, editing, and professional applications, the standard contains four additional Intra-frame-only profiles, which are defined as simple subsets of other corresponding profiles. These are mostly for professional (e.g., camera and editing system) applications:

;High 10 Intra Profile (110 with constraint set 3): The High 10 Profile constrained to all-Intra use.
;High 422 Intra Profile (122 with constraint set 3): The High 4:2:2 Profile constrained to all-Intra use.
;High 444 Intra Profile (244 with constraint set 3): The High 4:4:4 Profile constrained to all-Intra use.
;CAVLC 444 Intra Profile (44): The High 4:4:4 Profile constrained to all-Intra use and to CAVLC entropy coding (i.e., not supporting CABAC).

As a result of the Scalable Video Coding (SVC) extension, the standard contains five additional &quot;scalable profiles&quot;, which are defined as a combination of a H.264/AVC profile for the base layer (identified by the second word in the scalable profile name) and tools that achieve the scalable extension:

;Scalable Baseline Profile (83): Primarily targeting video conferencing, mobile, and surveillance applications, this profile builds on top of the Constrained Baseline profile to which the base layer (a subset of the bitstream) must conform. For the scalability tools, a subset of the available tools is enabled.
;Scalable Constrained Baseline Profile (83 with constraint set 5): A subset of the Scalable Baseline Profile intended primarily for real-time communication applications.
;Scalable High Profile (86): Primarily targeting broadcast and streaming applications, this profile builds on top of the H.264/AVC High Profile to which the base layer must conform.
;Scalable Constrained High Profile (86 with constraint set 5): A subset of the Scalable High Profile intended primarily for real-time communication applications.
;Scalable High Intra Profile (86 with constraint set 3): Primarily targeting production applications, this profile is the Scalable High Profile constrained to all-Intra use.

As a result of the Multiview Video Coding (MVC) extension, the standard contains two &quot;multiview profiles&quot;:

;Stereo High Profile (128): This profile targets two-view stereoscopic 3D video and combines the tools of the High profile with the inter-view prediction capabilities of the MVC extension.
;Multiview High Profile (118): This profile supports two or more views using both inter-picture (temporal) and MVC inter-view prediction, but does not support field pictures and macroblock-adaptive frame-field coding.

The Multi-resolution Frame-Compatible (MFC) extension added two more profiles:

;MFC High Profile (134): A profile for stereoscopic coding with two-layer resolution enhancement.
;MFC Depth High Profile (135):

The 3D-AVC extension added two more profiles:

;Multiview Depth High Profile (138): This profile supports joint coding of depth map and video texture information for improved compression of 3D video content.
;Enhanced Multiview Depth High Profile (139): An enhanced profile for combined multiview coding with depth information.

==== Feature support in particular profiles ====
=== Levels ===
As the term is used in the standard, a &quot;level&quot; is a specified set of constraints that indicate a degree of required decoder performance for a profile. For example, a level of support within a profile specifies the maximum picture resolution, frame rate, and bit rate that a decoder may use. A decoder that conforms to a given level must be able to decode all bitstreams encoded for that level and all lower levels.

The maximum bit rate for the High Profile is 1.25 times that of the Constrained Baseline, Baseline, Extended and Main Profiles; 3 times for Hi10P, and 4 times for Hi422P/Hi444PP.

The number of luma samples is 16×16=256 times the number of macroblocks (and the number of luma samples per second is 256 times the number of macroblocks per second).

=== Decoded picture buffering ===
Previously encoded pictures are used by H.264/AVC encoders to provide predictions of the values of samples in other pictures. This allows the encoder to make efficient decisions on the best way to encode a given picture. At the decoder, such pictures are stored in a virtual &quot;decoded picture buffer&quot; (DPB). The maximum capacity of the DPB, in units of frames (or pairs of fields), as shown in parentheses in the right column of the table above, can be computed as follows:

Where is a constant value provided in the table below as a function of level number, and and are the picture width and frame height for the coded video data, expressed in units of macroblocks (rounded up to integer values and accounting for cropping and macroblock pairing when applicable). This formula is specified in sections A.3.1.h and A.3.2.f of the 2017 edition of the standard.


For example, for an HDTV picture that is 1,920 samples wide () and 1,080 samples high (), a Level 4 decoder has a maximum DPB storage capacity of = 4 frames (or 8 fields). Thus, the value 4 is shown in parentheses in the table above in the right column of the row for Level 4 with the frame size 1920×1080.

The current picture being decoded is &quot;not included&quot; in the computation of DPB fullness (unless the encoder has indicated for it to be stored for use as a reference for decoding other pictures or for delayed output timing). Thus, a decoder needs to actually have sufficient memory to handle (at least) one frame &quot;more&quot; than the maximum capacity of the DPB as calculated above.

== Implementations ==

In 2009, the HTML5 working group was split between supporters of Ogg Theora, a free video format which is thought to be unencumbered by patents, and H.264, which contains patented technology. As late as July 2009, Google and Apple were said to support H.264, while Mozilla and Opera support Ogg Theora (now Google, Mozilla and Opera all support Theora and WebM with VP8). Microsoft, with the release of Internet Explorer 9, has added support for HTML 5 video encoded using H.264. At the Gartner Symposium/ITXpo in November 2010, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer answered the question &quot;HTML 5 or Silverlight?&quot; by saying &quot;If you want to do something that is universal, there is no question the world is going HTML5.&quot; In January 2011, Google announced that they were pulling support for H.264 from their Chrome browser and supporting both Theora and WebM/VP8 to use only open formats.

On March 18, 2012, Mozilla announced support for H.264 in Firefox on mobile devices, due to prevalence of H.264-encoded video and the increased power-efficiency of using dedicated H.264 decoder hardware common on such devices. On February 20, 2013, Mozilla implemented support in Firefox for decoding H.264 on Windows 7 and above. This feature relies on Windows&#x27; built in decoding libraries. Firefox 35.0, released on January 13, 2015, supports H.264 on OS X 10.6 and higher.

On October 30, 2013, Rowan Trollope from Cisco Systems announced that Cisco would release both binaries and source code of an H.264 video codec called OpenH264 under the Simplified BSD license, and pay all royalties for its use to MPEG LA for any software projects that use Cisco&#x27;s precompiled binaries, thus making Cisco&#x27;s OpenH264 &quot;binaries&quot; free to use. However, any software projects that use Cisco&#x27;s source code instead of its binaries would be legally responsible for paying all royalties to MPEG LA. Target CPU architectures include x86 and ARM, and target operating systems include Linux, Windows XP and later, Mac OS X, and Android; iOS was notably absent from this list, because it doesn&#x27;t allow applications to fetch and install binary modules from the Internet. Also on October 30, 2013, Brendan Eich from Mozilla wrote that it would use Cisco&#x27;s binaries in future versions of Firefox to add support for H.264 to Firefox where platform codecs are not available. Cisco published the source code to OpenH264 on December 9, 2013.

Although iOS was not supported by the 2013 Cisco software release, Apple updated its Video Toolbox Framework with iOS 8 (released in September 2014) to provide direct access to hardware-based H.264/AVC video encoding and decoding.

=== Software encoders ===
=== Hardware ===

Because H.264 encoding and decoding requires significant computing power in specific types of arithmetic operations, software implementations that run on general-purpose CPUs are typically less power efficient. However, the latest quad-core general-purpose x86 CPUs have sufficient computation power to perform real-time SD and HD encoding. Compression efficiency depends on video algorithmic implementations, not on whether hardware or software implementation is used. Therefore, the difference between hardware and software based implementation is more on power-efficiency, flexibility and cost. To improve the power efficiency and reduce hardware form-factor, special-purpose hardware may be employed, either for the complete encoding or decoding process, or for acceleration assistance within a CPU-controlled environment.

CPU based solutions are known to be much more flexible, particularly when encoding must be done concurrently in multiple formats, multiple bit rates and resolutions (multi-screen video), and possibly with additional features on container format support, advanced integrated advertising features, etc. CPU based software solution generally makes it much easier to load balance multiple concurrent encoding sessions within the same CPU.

The 2nd generation Intel &quot;Sandy Bridge&quot; Core i3/i5/i7 processors introduced at the January 2011 CES (Consumer Electronics Show) offer an on-chip hardware full HD H.264 encoder, known as Intel Quick Sync Video.

A hardware H.264 encoder can be an ASIC or an FPGA.

ASIC encoders with H.264 encoder functionality are available from many different semiconductor companies, but the core design used in the ASIC is typically licensed from one of a few companies such as Chips&amp;Media, Allegro DVT, On2 (formerly Hantro, acquired by Google), Imagination Technologies, NGCodec. Some companies have both FPGA and ASIC product offerings.

Texas Instruments manufactures a line of ARM + DSP cores that perform DSP H.264 BP encoding 1080p at 30fps. This permits flexibility with respect to codecs (which are implemented as highly optimized DSP code) while being more efficient than software on a generic CPU.

== Licensing ==

In countries where patents on software algorithms are upheld, vendors and commercial users of products that use H.264/AVC are expected to pay patent licensing royalties for the patented technology that their products use. This applies to the Baseline Profile as well.

A private organization known as MPEG LA, which is not affiliated in any way with the MPEG standardization organization, administers the licenses for patents applying to this standard, as well as other patent pools, such as for MPEG-4 Part 2 Video, HEVC and MPEG-DASH. The patent holders include Fujitsu, Panasonic, Sony, Mitsubishi, Apple, Columbia University, KAIST, Dolby, Google, JVC Kenwood, LG Electronics, Microsoft, NTT Docomo, Philips, Samsung, Sharp, Toshiba and ZTE, although the majority of patents in the pool are held by Panasonic ( patents), Godo Kaisha IP Bridge ( patents) and LG Electronics (990 patents).

On August 26, 2010, MPEG LA announced that royalties won&#x27;t be charged for H.264 encoded Internet video that is free to end users. All other royalties remain in place, such as royalties for products that decode and encode H.264 video as well as to operators of free television and subscription channels. The license terms are updated in 5-year blocks.

Since the first version of the standard was completed in May 2003 ( years ago) and the most commonly used profile (the High profile) was completed in June 2004 ( years ago), some of the relevant patents are expired by now, while others are still in force in jurisdictions around the world and one of the US patents in the MPEG LA H.264 pool (granted in 2016, priority from 2001) lasts at least until November 2030.

In 2005, Qualcomm sued Broadcom in US District Court, alleging that Broadcom infringed on two of its patents by making products that were compliant with the H.264 video compression standard. In 2007, the District Court found that the patents were unenforceable because Qualcomm had failed to disclose them to the JVT prior to the release of the H.264 standard in May 2003. In December 2008, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court&#x27;s order that the patents be unenforceable but remanded to the District Court with instructions to limit the scope of unenforceability to H.264 compliant products.

In October 2023 Nokia sued HP and Amazon for H.264/H.265 patent infringement in USA, UK and other locations.

<doc id="237037" wikidata="Q1725874" url="?curid=237037" title="Cartesian closed category">
<text>In category theory, a category is Cartesian closed if, roughly speaking, any morphism defined on a product of two objects can be naturally identified with a morphism defined on one of the factors. These categories are particularly important in mathematical logic and the theory of programming, in that their internal language is the simply typed lambda calculus. They are generalized by closed monoidal categories, whose internal language, linear type systems, are suitable for both quantum and classical computation.

==Etymology==
Named after René Descartes (1596–1650), French philosopher, mathematician, and scientist, whose formulation of analytic geometry gave rise to the concept of Cartesian product, which was later generalized to the notion of categorical product.

== Definition ==
The category C is called Cartesian closed iff it satisfies the following three properties:
* It has a terminal object.
* Any two objects &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; of C have a product &quot;X&quot; ×&quot;Y&quot; in C.
* Any two objects &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; of C have an exponential &quot;ZY&quot; in C.

The first two conditions can be combined to the single requirement that any finite (possibly empty) family of objects of &quot;C&quot; admit a product in &quot;C&quot;, because of the natural associativity of the categorical product and because the empty product in a category is the terminal object of that category.

The third condition is equivalent to the requirement that the functor – ×&quot;Y&quot; (i.e. the functor from C to C that maps objects &quot;X&quot; to &quot;X&quot; ×&quot;Y&quot; and morphisms φ to φ×id&quot;Y&quot;) has a right adjoint, usually denoted –&quot;Y&quot;, for all objects &quot;Y&quot; in C. 
For locally small categories, this can be expressed by the existence of a bijection between the hom-sets
:formula_1
which is natural in &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, and &quot;Z&quot;.

Take care to note that a Cartesian closed category need not have finite limits; only finite products are guaranteed.

If a category has the property that all its slice categories are Cartesian closed, then it is called &quot;locally cartesian closed&quot;. Note that if C is locally Cartesian closed, it need not actually be Cartesian closed; that happens if and only if C has a terminal object.

== Basic constructions ==

=== Evaluation ===

For each object &quot;Y&quot;, the counit of the exponential adjunction is a natural transformation 
:formula_2
called the (internal) evaluation map. More generally, we can construct the partial application map as the composite
:formula_3

In the particular case of the category Set, these reduce to the ordinary operations:
:formula_4

=== Composition ===

Evaluating the exponential in one argument at a morphism &quot;p&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; gives morphisms
:formula_5
:formula_6
corresponding to the operation of composition with &quot;p&quot;. Alternate notations for the operation &quot;p&quot;&quot;Z&quot; include &quot;p&quot;* and &quot;p&quot;∘-. Alternate notations for the operation &quot;Z&quot;&quot;p&quot; include &quot;p&quot;* and -∘&quot;p&quot;.

Evaluation maps can be chained as
:formula_7
the corresponding arrow under the exponential adjunction 
:formula_8
is called the (internal) composition map.

In the particular case of the category Set, this is the ordinary composition operation:
:formula_9

=== Sections ===

For a morphism &quot;p&quot;:&quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot;, suppose the following pullback square exists, which defines the subobject of &quot;X&quot;&quot;Y&quot; corresponding to maps whose composite with &quot;p&quot; is the identity:
:formula_10
where the arrow on the right is &quot;p&quot;&quot;Y&quot; and the arrow on the bottom corresponds to the identity on &quot;Y&quot;. Then Γ&quot;Y&quot;(&quot;p&quot;) is called the object of sections of &quot;p&quot;. It is often abbreviated as Γ&quot;Y&quot;(&quot;X&quot;).

If Γ&quot;Y&quot;(&quot;p&quot;) exists for every morphism &quot;p&quot; with codomain &quot;Y&quot;, then it can be assembled into a functor Γ&quot;Y&quot; : &quot;C&quot;/&quot;Y&quot; → &quot;C&quot; on the slice category, which is right adjoint to a variant of the product functor:
: formula_11
The exponential by &quot;Y&quot; can be expressed in terms of sections:
: formula_12

== Examples ==
Examples of Cartesian closed categories include:
* The category Set of all sets, with functions as morphisms, is Cartesian closed. The product &quot;X&quot;×&quot;Y&quot; is the Cartesian product of &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;, and &quot;Z&quot;&quot;Y&quot; is the set of all functions from &quot;Y&quot; to &quot;Z&quot;. The adjointness is expressed by the following fact: the function &quot;f&quot; : &quot;X&quot;×&quot;Y&quot; → &quot;Z&quot; is naturally identified with the curried function &quot;g&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Z&quot;&quot;Y&quot; defined by &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)(&quot;y&quot;) = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) for all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot; and &quot;y&quot; in &quot;Y&quot;.
* The subcategory of finite sets, with functions as morphisms, is also Cartesian closed for the same reason.
* If &quot;G&quot; is a group, then the category of all &quot;G&quot;-sets is Cartesian closed. If &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; are two &quot;G&quot;-sets, then &quot;Z&quot;&quot;Y&quot; is the set of all functions from &quot;Y&quot; to &quot;Z&quot; with &quot;G&quot; action defined by (&quot;g&quot;.&quot;F&quot;)(&quot;y&quot;) = &quot;g&quot;.F(&quot;g&quot;−1.&quot;y&quot;) for all &quot;g&quot; in &quot;G&quot;, &quot;F&quot;:&quot;Y&quot; → &quot;Z&quot; and &quot;y&quot; in &quot;Y&quot;. 
* The subcategory of finite &quot;G&quot;-sets is also Cartesian closed.
* The category Cat of all small categories (with functors as morphisms) is Cartesian closed; the exponential &quot;C&quot;&quot;D&quot; is given by the functor category consisting of all functors from &quot;D&quot; to &quot;C&quot;, with natural transformations as morphisms.
* If &quot;C&quot; is a small category, then the functor category Set&quot;C&quot; consisting of all covariant functors from &quot;C&quot; into the category of sets, with natural transformations as morphisms, is Cartesian closed. If &quot;F&quot; and &quot;G&quot; are two functors from &quot;C&quot; to Set, then the exponential &quot;F&quot;&quot;G&quot; is the functor whose value on the object &quot;X&quot; of &quot;C&quot; is given by the set of all natural transformations from to &quot;F&quot;.
** The earlier example of &quot;G&quot;-sets can be seen as a special case of functor categories: every group can be considered as a one-object category, and &quot;G&quot;-sets are nothing but functors from this category to Set
** The category of all directed graphs is Cartesian closed; this is a functor category as explained under functor category.
** In particular, the category of simplicial sets (which are functors &quot;X&quot; : Δop → Set) is Cartesian closed.
* Even more generally, every elementary topos is Cartesian closed.
* In algebraic topology, Cartesian closed categories are particularly easy to work with. Neither the category of topological spaces with continuous maps nor the category of smooth manifolds with smooth maps is Cartesian closed. Substitute categories have therefore been considered: the category of compactly generated Hausdorff spaces is Cartesian closed, as is the category of Frölicher spaces.
* In order theory, complete partial orders (&quot;cpo&quot;s) have a natural topology, the Scott topology, whose continuous maps do form a Cartesian closed category (that is, the objects are the cpos, and the morphisms are the Scott continuous maps). Both currying and &quot;apply&quot; are continuous functions in the Scott topology, and currying, together with apply, provide the adjoint. 
* A Heyting algebra is a Cartesian closed (bounded) lattice. An important example arises from topological spaces. If &quot;X&quot; is a topological space, then the open sets in &quot;X&quot; form the objects of a category O(&quot;X&quot;) for which there is a unique morphism from &quot;U&quot; to &quot;V&quot; if &quot;U&quot; is a subset of &quot;V&quot; and no morphism otherwise. This poset is a Cartesian closed category: the &quot;product&quot; of &quot;U&quot; and &quot;V&quot; is the intersection of &quot;U&quot; and &quot;V&quot; and the exponential &quot;U&quot;&quot;V&quot; is the interior of .
* A category with a zero object is Cartesian closed if and only if it is equivalent to a category with only one object and one identity morphism. Indeed, if 0 is an initial object and 1 is a final object and we have formula_13, then formula_14 which has only one element.
**In particular, any non-trivial category with a zero object, such as an abelian category, is not Cartesian closed. So the category of modules over a ring is not Cartesian closed. However, the functor tensor product formula_15 with a fixed module does have a right adjoint. The tensor product is not a categorical product, so this does not contradict the above. We obtain instead that the category of modules is monoidal closed.

Examples of locally Cartesian closed categories include:
* Every elementary topos is locally Cartesian closed. This example includes Set, &quot;FinSet&quot;, &quot;G&quot;-sets for a group &quot;G&quot;, as well as Set&quot;C&quot; for small categories &quot;C&quot;.
* The category &quot;LH&quot; whose objects are topological spaces and whose morphisms are local homeomorphisms is locally Cartesian closed, since &quot;LH&quot;/&quot;X&quot; is equivalent to the category of sheaves . However, &quot;LH&quot; does not have a terminal object, and thus is not Cartesian closed.
* If &quot;C&quot; has pullbacks and for every arrow &quot;p&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot;, the functor &quot;p&quot;* : &quot;C/Y&quot; → &quot;C/X&quot; given by taking pullbacks has a right adjoint, then &quot;C&quot; is locally Cartesian closed.
* If &quot;C&quot; is locally Cartesian closed, then all of its slice categories &quot;C&quot;/&quot;X&quot; are also locally Cartesian closed.

Non-examples of locally Cartesian closed categories include:
* Cat is not locally Cartesian closed.

== Applications ==
In Cartesian closed categories, a &quot;function of two variables&quot; (a morphism &quot;f&quot; : &quot;X&quot;×&quot;Y&quot; → &quot;Z&quot;) can always be represented as a &quot;function of one variable&quot; (the morphism λ&quot;f&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Z&quot;&quot;Y&quot;). In computer science applications, this is known as currying; it has led to the realization that simply-typed lambda calculus can be interpreted in any Cartesian closed category.

The Curry–Howard–Lambek correspondence provides a deep isomorphism between intuitionistic logic, simply-typed lambda calculus and Cartesian closed categories.

Certain Cartesian closed categories, the topoi, have been proposed as a general setting for mathematics, instead of traditional set theory.

Computer scientist John Backus has advocated a variable-free notation, or Function-level programming, which in retrospect bears some similarity to the internal language of Cartesian closed categories. CAML is more consciously modelled on Cartesian closed categories.

== Dependent sum and product ==

Let &quot;C&quot; be a locally Cartesian closed category. Then &quot;C&quot; has all pullbacks, because the pullback of two arrows with codomain &quot;Z&quot; is given by the product in &quot;C&quot;/&quot;Z&quot;.

For every arrow &quot;p&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot;, let &quot;P&quot; denote the corresponding object of &quot;C/Y&quot;. Taking pullbacks along &quot;p&quot; gives a functor &quot;p&quot;* : &quot;C&quot;/&quot;Y&quot; → &quot;C&quot;/&quot;X&quot; which has both a left and a right adjoint.

The left adjoint formula_16 is called the dependent sum and is given by composition formula_17.

The right adjoint formula_18 is called the dependent product.

The exponential by &quot;P&quot; in &quot;C&quot;/&quot;Y&quot; can be expressed in terms of the dependent product by the formula formula_19.

The reason for these names is because, when interpreting &quot;P&quot; as a dependent type formula_20, the functors formula_21 and formula_22 correspond to the type formations formula_23 and formula_24 respectively.

== Equational theory ==
In every Cartesian closed category (using exponential notation), (&quot;X&quot;&quot;Y&quot;)&quot;Z&quot; and (&quot;X&quot;&quot;Z&quot;)&quot;Y&quot; are isomorphic for all objects &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;Z&quot;. We write this as the &quot;equation&quot;

:(&quot;x&quot;&quot;y&quot;)&quot;z&quot; = (&quot;x&quot;&quot;z&quot;)&quot;y&quot;.

One may ask what other such equations are valid in all Cartesian closed categories. It turns out that all of them follow logically from the following axioms:
*&quot;x&quot;×(&quot;y&quot;×&quot;z&quot;) = (&quot;x&quot;×&quot;y&quot;)×&quot;z&quot;
*&quot;x&quot;×&quot;y&quot; = &quot;y&quot;×&quot;x&quot;
*&quot;x&quot;×1 = &quot;x&quot; (here 1 denotes the terminal object of &quot;C&quot;)
*1&quot;x&quot; = 1
*&quot;x&quot;1 = &quot;x&quot;
*(&quot;x&quot;×&quot;y&quot;)&quot;z&quot; = &quot;x&quot;&quot;z&quot;×&quot;y&quot;&quot;z&quot;
*(&quot;x&quot;&quot;y&quot;)&quot;z&quot; = &quot;x&quot;(&quot;y&quot;×&quot;z&quot;)

===Bicartesian closed categories===
Bicartesian closed categories extend Cartesian closed categories with binary coproducts and an initial object, with products distributing over coproducts. Their equational theory is extended with the following axioms, yielding something similar to Tarski&#x27;s high school axioms but with a zero:
*&quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot; = &quot;y&quot; + &quot;x&quot;
*(&quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot;) + &quot;z&quot; = &quot;x&quot; + (&quot;y&quot; + &quot;z&quot;)
*&quot;x&quot;×(&quot;y&quot; + &quot;z&quot;) = &quot;x&quot;×&quot;y&quot; + &quot;x&quot;×&quot;z&quot;
*&quot;x&quot;(&quot;y&quot; + &quot;z&quot;) = &quot;xy×xz&quot;
*0 + &quot;x&quot; = &quot;x&quot;
*&quot;x&quot;×0 = 0
*&quot;x&quot;0 = 1

Note however that the above list is not complete; type isomorphism in the free BCCC is not finitely axiomatizable, and its decidability is still an open problem.

<text>Detmold () is a city in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, with a population of . It was the capital of the small Principality of Lippe from 1468 until 1918 and then of the Free State of Lippe until 1947. Today it is the administrative center of the district of Lippe and of the Regierungsbezirk Detmold. The Church of Lippe has its central administration located in Detmold. The Reformed Redeemer Church is the preaching venue of the state superintendent of the Lippe church.

==History==

===Iron Age===
About to the southwest of Detmold is the hill with a prehistoric circular rampart and the Hermann monument (). The monument commemorates the so-called Battle of the Teutoburg Forest, a battle in 9 AD which may or may not have been fought close to the present location of Detmold. In this encounter, Germanic tribes led by Hermann () defeated Roman legions under the command of Publius Quinctilius Varus.

===Middle Ages===
Detmold was first mentioned as &quot;Theotmalli&quot; in 783, the year of a battle between the Saxons and Charlemagne&#x27;s forces nearby. This was an event in the Saxon Wars. In 1005 a Tietmelli or Theotmalli region (&quot;Gau&quot;) is referred to in documents.

In 1263, Bernard III of Lippe fortified the settlement at the crossing of the trade route from Paderborn to Lemgo over the Werre River with stone walls and granted it a municipal charter. Its population was reported in 1305 as 305. Market rights granted in 1265 led to rapid economic development. Its defenses were greatly strengthened after severe damage had been inflicted on the town during the conflict with Soest in 1447. A major fire in 1547 destroyed more than 70 houses.

In 1550, Detmold became the permanent residence of Count Simon III of Lippe. The counts were elevated to princes in 1789, and Detmold remained the capital of the small Principality of Lippe until the end of the World War I in 1918, when all princely states in Germany were abolished. Today, Stephan, Prince of Lippe is the owner of Detmold Castle.

===Modern era===
Street lighting was introduced in 1809, with oil-fired lanterns. By 1835, the town had become the most populous in Lippe, with over 4,000 residents. It grew to 12,000 in 1900 and over 30,000 in 1950.

From 1919 to 1947, Detmold was the capital of the Free State of Lippe. The &#x27; started in 1878 and, in co-operation with other reginal papers, is still published today. The competing &#x27; was published in Detmold from 1896 until 1938. During the Nazi years (1933–1945), the was the official party and government publication. When Lippe was incorporated into the new German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, the town became the seat of the Lippe district, and since 1972 it has been the seat of the district administration of Lippe. With the administrative reform of 1970, 25 nearby villages were incorporated into the city.

The former Hobart Barracks is nearby.

<doc id="237052" wikidata="Q208580" url="?curid=237052" title="Entoprocta">
<text>Entoprocta (), or Kamptozoa , is a phylum of mostly sessile aquatic animals, ranging from long. Mature individuals are goblet-shaped, on relatively long stalks. They have a &quot;crown&quot; of solid tentacles whose cilia generate water currents that draw food particles towards the mouth, and both the mouth and anus lie inside the &quot;crown&quot;. The superficially similar Bryozoa (Ectoprocta) have the anus outside a &quot;crown&quot; of hollow tentacles. Most families of entoprocts are colonial, and all but 2 of the 150 species are marine. A few solitary species can move slowly.

Some species eject unfertilized ova into the water, while others keep their ova in brood chambers until they hatch, and some of these species use placenta-like organs to nourish the developing eggs. After hatching, the larvae swim for a short time and then settle on a surface. There they metamorphose, and the larval gut rotates by up to 180°, so that the mouth and anus face upwards. Both colonial and solitary species also reproduce by cloning — solitary species grow clones in the space between the tentacles and then release them when developed, while colonial ones produce new members from the stalks or from corridor-like stolons.

Fossils of entoprocts are very rare, and the earliest specimens that have been identified with confidence date from the Late Jurassic. Most studies from 1996 onwards have regarded entoprocts as members of the Trochozoa, which also includes molluscs and annelids. However, a study in 2008 concluded that entoprocts are closely related to bryozoans. Other studies place them in a clade Tetraneuralia, together with molluscs.

==Names==
&quot;Entoprocta&quot;, coined in 1870, means &quot;anus inside&quot;. The alternative name &quot;Kamptozoa&quot;, meaning &quot;bent&quot; or &quot;curved&quot; animals, was assigned in 1929. Some authors use &quot;Entoprocta&quot;, while others prefer &quot;Kamptozoa&quot;.

==Description==
Most species are colonial, and their members are known as &quot;zooids&quot;, since they are not fully independent animals. Zooids are typically long but range from long.

===Distinguishing features===
Entoprocts are superficially like bryozoans (ectoprocts), as both groups have a &quot;crown&quot; of tentacles whose cilia generate water currents that draw food particles towards the mouth. However, they have different feeding mechanisms and internal anatomy, and bryozoans undergo a metamorphosis from larva to adult that destroys most of the larval tissues; their colonies also have a founder zooid which is different from its &quot;daughters&quot;.


===Zooids===

The body of a mature entoproct zooid has a goblet-like structure with a calyx mounted on a relatively long stalk that attaches to a surface. The rim of the calyx bears a &quot;crown&quot; of 8 to 30 solid tentacles, which are extensions of the body wall. The base of the &quot;crown&quot; of tentacles is surrounded by a membrane that partially covers the tentacles when they retract. The mouth and anus lie on opposite sides of the atrium (space enclosed by the &quot;crown&quot; of tentacles), and both can be closed by sphincter muscles. The gut is U-shaped, curving down towards the base of the calyx, where it broadens to form the stomach. This is lined with a membrane consisting of a single layer of cells, each of which has multiple cilia.

The stalks of colonial species arise from shared attachment plates or from a network of stolons, tubes that run across a surface. In solitary species, the stalk ends in a muscular sucker, or a flexible foot, or is cemented to a surface. The stalk is muscular and produces a characteristic nodding motion. In some species it is segmented. Some solitary species can move, either by creeping on the muscular foot or by somersaulting.

The body wall consists of the epidermis and an external cuticle, which consists mainly of criss-cross collagen fibers. The epidermis contains only a single layer of cells, each of which bears multiple cilia (&quot;hairs&quot;) and microvilli (tiny &quot;pleats&quot;) that penetrate through the cuticle. The stolons and stalks of colonial species have thicker cuticles, stiffened with chitin.

There is no coelom (internal fluid-filled cavity lined with peritoneum) and the other internal organs are embedded in connective tissue that lies between the stomach and the base of the &quot;crown&quot; of tentacles. The nervous system runs through the connective tissue and just below the epidermis, and is controlled by a pair of ganglia. Nerves run from these to the calyx, tentacles and stalk, and to sense organs in all these areas.

==Vegetative functions==
A band of cells, each with multiple cilia, runs along the sides of the tentacles, connecting each tentacle to its neighbors, except that there is a gap in the band nearest the anus. A separate band of cilia grows along a groove that runs close to the inner side of the base of the &quot;crown&quot;, with a narrow extension up the inner surface of each tentacle. The cilia on the sides of the tentacles create a current that flows into the &quot;crown&quot; at the bases of the tentacles and exits above the center of the &quot;crown&quot;. These cilia pass food particles to the cilia on the inner surface of the tentacles, and the inner cilia produce a downward current that drives particles into and around the groove, and then to the mouth.

Entoprocts generally use one or both of: ciliary sieving, in which one band of cilia creates the feeding current and another traps food particles (the &quot;sieve&quot;); and downstream collecting, in which food particles are trapped as they are about to exit past them. In entoprocts, downstream collecting is carried out by the same bands of cilia that generate the current; trochozoan larvae also use downstream collecting, but use a separate set of cilia to trap food particles.

In addition, glands in the tentacles secrete sticky threads that capture large particles. A non-colonial species reported from around the Antarctic Peninsula in 1993 has cells that superficially resemble the cnidocytes of cnidaria, and fire sticky threads. These unusual cells lie around the mouth, and may provide an additional means of capturing prey.

The stomach and intestine are lined with microvilli, which are thought to absorb nutrients. The anus, which opens inside the &quot;crown&quot;, ejects solid wastes into the outgoing current after the tentacles have filtered food out of the water; in some families it is raised on a cone above the level of the groove that conducts food to the mouth. Most species have a pair of protonephridia which extract soluble wastes from the internal fluids and eliminate them through pores near the mouth. However, the freshwater species &quot;Urnatella gracilis&quot; has multiple nephridia in the calyx and stalk.

The zooids absorb oxygen and emit carbon dioxide by diffusion, which works well for small animals.

==Reproduction and life cycle==
Most species are simultaneous hermaphrodites, but some switch from male to female as they mature, while individuals of some species remain of the same sex all their lives. Individuals have one or two pairs of gonads, placed between the atrium and stomach, and opening into a single gonopore in the atrium. The eggs are thought to be fertilized in the ovaries. Most species release eggs that hatch into planktonic larvae, but a few brood their eggs in the gonopore. Those that brood small eggs nourish them by a placenta-like organ, while larvae of species with larger eggs live on stored yolk. The development of the fertilized egg into a larva follows a typical spiralian pattern: the cells divide by spiral cleavage, and mesoderm develops from a specific cell labelled &quot;4d&quot; in the early embryo. There is no coelom at any stage.

In some species the larva is a trochophore which is planktonic and feeds on floating food particles by using the two bands of cilia round its &quot;equator&quot; to sweep food into the mouth, which uses more cilia to drive them into the stomach, which uses further cilia to expel undigested remains through the anus. In some species of the genera &quot;Loxosomella&quot; and &quot;Loxosoma&quot;, the larva produces one or two buds that separate and form new individuals, while the trochophore disintegrates. However, most produce a larva with sensory tufts at the top and front, a pair of pigment-cup ocelli (&quot;little eyes&quot;), a pair of protonephridia, and a large, cilia-bearing foot at the bottom. After settling, the foot and frontal tuft attach to the surface. Larvae of most species undergo a complex metamorphosis, and the internal organs may rotate by up to 180°, so that the mouth and anus both point upwards.

All species can produce clones by budding. Colonial species produce new zooids from the stolon or from the stalks, and can form large colonies in this way. In solitary species, clones form on the floor of the atrium, and are released when their organs are developed.

==Taxonomy==

The phylum consists of about 150 recognized species, grouped into 4 families:

==Evolutionary history==

===Fossil record===

Since entoprocts are small and soft-bodied, fossils have been extremely rare. In 1977, Simon Conway Morris provided the first description of &quot;Dinomischus&quot;, a sessile animal with calyx, stalk and holdfast, found in Canada&#x27;s Burgess Shale, which was formed about . Conway Morris regarded this animal as the earliest known entoproct, since its mouth and anus lay inside a ring of structures above the calyx, but noted that these structures were flat and rather stiff, while the tentacles of modern entoprocts are flexible and have a round cross-section.

In 1992 J.A. Todd and P.D. Taylor concluded that &quot;Dinomischus&quot; was not an entoproct, because it did not have the typical rounded, flexible tentacles, and the fossils showed no other features that clearly resembled those of entoprocts. In their opinion, the earliest fossil entoprocts were specimens they found from Late Jurassic rocks in England. These resemble the modern colonial genus &quot;Barentsia&quot; in many ways, including: upright zooids linked by a network of stolons encrusting the surface to which the colony is attached; straight stalks joined to the stolons by bulky sockets with transverse bands of wrinkles; overall size and proportions similar to that of modern species of &quot;Barentsia&quot;.

Another species, &quot;Cotyledion tylodes&quot;, first described in 1999, was larger than extant entoprocts, reaching 8–56 mm in height, and unlike modern species, was &quot;armored&quot; with sclerites, scale-like structures. &quot;C. tylodes&quot; did have a similar sessile lifestyle to modern entoprocts. The identified fossils of &quot;C. tylodes&quot; were found in 520-million-year-old rocks from southern China. This places early entoprocts in the period of the Cambrian explosion.

===Family tree===
When entoprocts were discovered in the nineteenth century, they and bryozoans (ectoprocts) were regarded as classes within the phylum Bryozoa, because both groups were sessile animals that filter-fed by means of a &quot;crown&quot; of tentacles that bore cilia. However, from 1869 onwards, increasing awareness of differences, including the position of the entoproct anus inside the feeding structure and the difference in the early pattern of division of cells in their embryos, caused scientists to regard the two groups as separate phyla. &quot;Bryozoa&quot; then became just an alternative name for ectoprocts, in which the anus is outside the feeding organ. However, studies by one team in 2007 and 2008 argue for sinking Entoprocta into Bryozoa as a class, and resurrecting &quot;Ectoprocta&quot; as a name for the currently identified bryozoans.

The consensus of studies from 1996 onwards has been that entoprocts are part of the Trochozoa, a protostome &quot;superphylum&quot; whose members are united in having as their most basic larval form the trochophore type. The trochozoa also include molluscs, annelids, flatworms, nemertines and others. However, scientists disagree about which phylum is mostly closely related to enctoprocts within the trochozoans. An analysis in 2008 re-introduced the pre-1869 meaning of the term &quot;Bryozoa&quot;, for a group in which entoprocts and ectoprocts are each other&#x27;s closest relatives.

==Ecology==

===Distribution and habitats===
All species are sessile. While the great majority are marine, two species live in freshwater: &quot;Loxosomatoides sirindhornae&quot;, reported in 2004 in central Thailand, and &quot;Urnatella gracilis&quot;, found in all the continents except Antarctica. Colonial species are found in all the oceans, living on rocks, shells, algae and underwater buildings. The solitary species, which are marine, live on other animals that feed by producing water currents, such as sponges, ectoprocts and sessile annelids. The majority of species live no deeper than 50 meters, but a few species are found in the deep ocean.

===Interaction with other organisms===
Some species of nudibranchs (&quot;sea slugs&quot;), particularly those of the genus &quot;Trapania&quot;, as well as turbellarian flatworms, prey on entoprocts.

Small colonies of the freshwater entoproct &quot;Urnatella gracilis&quot; have been found living on the aquatic larvae of the dobsonfly &quot;Corydalus cornutus&quot;. The ectoprocts gain a means of dispersal, protection from predators and possibly a source of water that is rich in oxygen and nutrients, as colonies often live next to the gills of the larval flies. In the White Sea, the non-colonial entoproct &quot;Loxosomella nordgaardi&quot; prefers to live attached to bryozoan (ectoproct) colonies, mainly on the edges of colonies or in the &quot;chimneys&quot;, gaps by which large bryozoan colonies expel water from which they have sieved food. Observation suggests that both the entoprocts and the bryozoans benefit from the association: each enhances the water flow that the other needs for feeding; and the longer cilia of the entoprocts may help them to capture different food from that caught by the bryozoans, so that the animals do not compete for the same food.

Entoprocts are small and have been little studied by zoologists. Hence it is difficult to determine whether a specimen belongs to a species that already occurs in the same area or is an invader, possibly as a result of human activities.

<text>Distributed web crawling is a distributed computing technique whereby Internet search engines employ many computers to index the Internet via web crawling. Such systems may allow for users to voluntarily offer their own computing and bandwidth resources towards crawling web pages. By spreading the load of these tasks across many computers, costs that would otherwise be spent on maintaining large computing clusters are avoided.

==Types==
Cho and Garcia-Molina studied two types of policies:

===Dynamic assignment===
With this type of policy, a central server assigns new URLs to different crawlers dynamically. This allows the central server to, for instance, dynamically balance the load of each crawler.

With dynamic assignment, typically the systems can also add or remove downloader processes. The central server may become the bottleneck, so most of the workload must be transferred to the distributed crawling processes for large crawls.

There are two configurations of crawling architectures with dynamic assignments that have been described by Shkapenyuk and Suel:
* A small crawler configuration, in which there is a central DNS resolver and central queues per Web site, and distributed downloaders.
* A large crawler configuration, in which the DNS resolver and the queues are also distributed.

===Static assignment===
With this type of policy, there is a fixed rule stated from the beginning of the crawl that defines how to assign new URLs to the crawlers.

For static assignment, a hashing function can be used to transform URLs (or, even better, complete website names) into a number that corresponds to the index of the corresponding crawling process. As there are external links that will go from a Web site assigned to one crawling process to a website assigned to a different crawling process, some exchange of URLs must occur.

To reduce the overhead due to the exchange of URLs between crawling processes, the exchange should be done in batch, several URLs at a time, and the most cited URLs in the collection should be known by all crawling processes before the crawl (e.g.: using data from a previous crawl).

==Implementations==
As of 2003, most modern commercial search engines use this technique. Google and Yahoo use thousands of individual computers to crawl the Web.

Newer projects are attempting to use a less structured, more &quot;ad hoc&quot; form of collaboration by enlisting volunteers to join the effort using, in many cases, their home or personal computers. LookSmart is the largest search engine to use this technique, which powers its Grub distributed web-crawling project. Wikia (now known as Fandom) acquired Grub from LookSmart in 2007. 

This solution uses computers that are connected to the Internet to crawl Internet addresses in the background. Upon downloading crawled web pages, they are compressed and sent back, together with a status flag (e.g. changed, new, down, redirected) to the powerful central servers. The servers, which manage a large database, send out new URLs to clients for testing.

==Drawbacks==
According to the FAQ about Nutch, an open-source search engine website, the savings in bandwidth by distributed web crawling are not significant, since &quot;A successful search engine requires more bandwidth to upload query result pages than its crawler needs to download pages...&quot;.

<doc id="237076" wikidata="Q1587893" url="?curid=237076" title="Battle of Tinchebray">
<text>The Battle of Tinchebray (alternative spellings: Tinchebrai or Tenchebrai) took place on 28 September 1106, in Tinchebray (today in the Orne &quot;département&quot; of France), Normandy, between an invading force led by King Henry I of England, and the Norman army of his elder brother Robert Curthose, the Duke of Normandy. Henry&#x27;s knights won a decisive victory: they captured Robert, and Henry imprisoned him in England (in Devizes Castle) and then in Wales until Robert&#x27;s death (in Cardiff Castle) in 1134.

==Prelude==
Henry invaded Normandy in 1105 in the course of an ongoing dynastic dispute with his brother. He took Bayeux and Caen, but broke off his campaign because of political problems arising from an investiture controversy. With these settled, he returned to Normandy in the spring of 1106. After quickly taking the fortified abbey of Saint-Pierre-sur-Dives (near Falaise), Henry turned south and besieged Tinchebray Castle, on a hill above the town. Tinchebray is on the border of the county of Mortain, in the southwest of Normandy, and was held by William, Count of Mortain, who was one of the few important Norman barons still loyal to Robert. Duke Robert then brought up his forces to break the siege. After some unsuccessful negotiations, Duke Robert decided that a battle in the open was his best option.

==Battle==
Henry&#x27;s army was organized into three groups. Ranulf of Bayeux, Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester, and William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey, commanded the two primary forces. A reserve, commanded by Elias I of Maine, remained out of sight on the flank. Alan IV, Duke of Brittany, William, Count of Évreux, Ralph of Tosny, Robert of Montfort, and Robert of Grandmesnil also fought alongside Henry. William, Count of Mortain, and Robert of Bellême, 3rd Earl of Shrewsbury, supported Robert Curthose.

The battle lasted an hour. Henry dismounted and ordered most of his knights to dismount. This was unusual given Norman battle tactics, and meant the infantry played a decisive role. William, Count of Évreux, charged the front line, with men from Bayeux, Avranches and the Cotentin. Henry&#x27;s reserve proved decisive.

==Aftermath==
Most of Robert&#x27;s army was captured or killed. Those captured included Robert, Edgar Ætheling (uncle of Henry&#x27;s wife), and William, Count of Mortain. Robert de Bellême, commanding the Duke&#x27;s rear guard, led the retreat, saving himself from capture or death. Most of the prisoners were released, but Robert Curthose and William of Mortain spent the rest of their lives in captivity. Robert Curthose had a legitimate son, William Clito (1102–1128), whose claims to the duchy of Normandy led to several rebellions which continued through the rest of Henry&#x27;s reign.

This battle was seen by early historians as revenge for the defeat of the Anglo-Saxons at Hastings. Normandy was conquered by the Medieval England.

<text>Latchford is a suburb and electoral ward of Warrington, in the ceremonial county of Cheshire, England. It is around one mile south-east of Warrington town centre and has a total resident population of 7,856.

Latchford is a predominantly residential area, Latchford lies between the River Mersey and the Manchester Ship Canal, and broadly consists of 19th-century terraced housing and some open space. The canal is crossed here by a swing bridge, a high-level road bridge and the now disused Latchford railway viaduct.

Its name came from Anglo-Saxon &quot;Læccford&quot; meaning &quot;boggy-stream ford&quot;.

==History==
Latchford was originally a township and chapelry in the ancient parish of Grappenhall, in Cheshire. It was also part of Bucklow Hundred, and was close to the border with Lancashire.

In 1866 Latchford became a separate civil parish, on 30 September 1898 the parish was abolished and merged with Warrington. In 1891 the parish had a population of 6225. Between 1894 and 1974, part of Latchford was placed within the County Borough of Warrington, and the registration county of Lancashire, whilst the rest of Latchford became a civil parish named Latchford Without and was transferred to Lancashire.

With the local government reforms of 1974, as part of the newly formed Cheshire borough of Warrington, Latchford was transferred back to Cheshire.

===Latchford Railway Viaduct===
Latchford viaduct was opened on 8 July 1893 to carry the London and North Western Railway&#x27;s Stockport to Warrington line over the Manchester Ship Canal. The wrought iron viaduct, with a span of , weighed more than 1,200 tonnes. The last passengers service ran in 1962, but the line continued to carry freight. It finally closed to all traffic in July 1985, when it was deemed too expensive to make extensive repairs to keep Latchford viaduct operational.

===Latchford Locks===

Latchford was chosen as the location of intermediate locks on the Manchester Ship Canal. These comprise a larger lock for ocean-going vessels and a smaller lock to its south for coasters, tugs and barges. A ship mooring area was provided on the canal&#x27;s south bank and enabled two large vessels to pass each other at this point. The locks are still used, but less often than before, as hardly any ships now go to the terminal docks at Manchester and Salford.

==Geography==
Latchford is bounded to the south by the Manchester Ship Canal and Stockton Heath and to the north by the River Mersey and Howley.

==Communal facilities==
===Victoria Park===

Victoria Park is an open space beside the Mersey, with a modern sports stadium and a skateboard park. It contains a large Georgian manor house, previously the Old Warps maternity hospital, subsequently converted into flats. Nearby is a narrow Victorian suspension bridge, Howley Bridge, which provides pedestrian access between Howley and Latchford.

Victoria Park is on the site of the Old Warps Estate. In 1897 the local council bought the estate from the owners and converted it into a park to provide an amenity for the local working-class people of the terraced housing of industrial Latchford. To mark the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria the park was named &quot;Victoria Park&quot;. The Georgian manor house &quot;Old Warps&quot; still stands and has been converted to a restaurant.

Before work on the Mersey commenced, Victoria Park was under the River Mersey, in an area that was considered dangerous by even the most experienced seamen. In 1724 various new weirs were built along the course of the River Mersey due to its often treacherous nature. The course of the Mersey was then altered and the land was converted into the Old Warps Estate. A weir was built and is still monitored 24 hours a day by a &quot;weir man&quot; from a wooden building situated about the weir, which is the tidal limit of the Mersey. The Mersey is so improved now that salmon and trout are often seen, as are herons, kingfishers and cormorants, especially in the wide pool on the river bend below the weir.

Access to Howley is provided by a suspension bridge for pedestrians, recently renovated by Warrington Borough Council.

Victoria Park has a large running track which is the home of Warrington Athletic Club, and has bowling greens, a skate-park and various other leisure facilities. A 5 km run against the clock is organised by the group Parkrun most Saturday mornings. Old Manor Lock marks the northern end of the park.

Victoria Park has also been used for the past 2 years for a new festival called Neighbourhood Weekender, which is an extended, larger version of the Neighbourhood inner-city festival in Manchester, and has taken place on May bank holiday, in 2018 and 2019.

===Black Bear Park===
Black Bear Canal, now infilled and used as Black Bear Park, once ran from docks on the Manchester Ship Canal near Wilderspool Causeway (to the west of Latchford) to the Mersey at Manor Lock in Howley, providing a shortcut for shipping, avoiding a large river bend and weir.

In 1804, an eight-mile long canal was built between Latchford and Runcorn. It was named the Old Quay Canal. Once the Manchester Ship Canal was dug, in the 1890s, it was shortened to one mile, from Stockton Heath to the River Mersey, at Manor Lock. It was renamed the Black Bear Canal. The Black Bear Canal remained in use for the transport of South American hides to tanneries, until the 1960s, when it fell into disuse.

Warrington Borough Council bought the land. After a local boy drowned in the late 1960s, it was converted in 1981 into a parkland forming a line from Victoria Park and the banks of the River Mersey, through to Stockton Heath. The park also forms a part of the Trans Pennine Trail.

<doc id="237080" wikidata="Q737236" url="?curid=237080" title="Mystique (character)">
<text>Mystique is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Chris Claremont and artist David Cockrum, the character first appeared in &quot;Ms. Marvel&quot; #16 (April 1978). A member of a subspecies of humanity known as mutants who are born with superhuman abilities, Mystique is a shapeshifter who can perfectly mimic the appearance and voice of any person. Her natural appearance includes blue skin, red hair, and yellow eyes.

Typically portrayed as a foe of the X-Men, Mystique has been both a supervillain and an antiheroine, founding her own Brotherhood of Mutants and assassinating several important people involved in mutant affairs. Stated to be over 100 years old, she commonly lives under the assumed name Raven Darkhölme, having previously used [[Sherlock Holmes]]. Mystique is the wife of Destiny / Irene Adler, the mother of the villain Graydon Creed, adoptive mother of the X-Men heroine Rogue, and the biological father of the X-Men hero Nightcrawler; conceived with her wife Destiny while in one of her male forms. Mystique has been described as one of Marvel&#x27;s most notable and powerful female antiheroes.

In live-action, Mystique appears in seven of 20th Century Fox&#x27;s &quot;X-Men&quot; films. The character was played by Rebecca Romijn in &quot;X-Men&quot; (2000), &quot;X2: X-Men United&quot; (2003), and &quot;X-Men: The Last Stand&quot; (2006), while Jennifer Lawrence played a younger version in &quot;X-Men: First Class&quot; (2011), &quot;X-Men: Days of Future Past&quot; (2014), &quot;X-Men: Apocalypse&quot; (2016), and &quot;X-Men: Dark Phoenix&quot; (2019). Romijn also cameod as Mystique in &quot;First Class&quot;.

==Publication history==
Mystique was created by David Cockrum. Chris Claremont saw Cockrum&#x27;s design, dubbed the character &quot;Mystique&quot;, and, with Cockrum&#x27;s permission, set her in &quot;Ms. Marvel&quot; #16 (May 1978). The character&#x27;s true appearance was revealed in &quot;Ms. Marvel&quot; #18 (June 1978) and first cover appearance in &quot;The Avengers&quot; Annual #10 (1981).

In July 2006, Claremont, a former &quot;X-Men&quot; writer, has said that he intended Mystique and Destiny to be Nightcrawler&#x27;s biological parents (with Mystique having morphed into a male body for the act of conception), but Marvel didn&#x27;t agree, because at that time the Comics Code Authority prohibited the explicit portrayal of gay or bisexual characters. This storyline would then be made canon in November 2023.

==Fictional character biography==
Mystique&#x27;s origins remain unknown: her shapeshifting powers mean that her true age remains enigmatic. Her earliest attested appearance dates back to the years around 1900, when she lived in a male guise as a &quot;consulting detective&quot; who established a romantic relationship with her reality&#x27;s version of Irene Adler, biographical details which imply she is in fact Sherlock Holmes, an implication confirmed by 2022.

=== Sabretooth ===
While in her Raven persona, Mystique adopts the identity of deceased German secret agent Leni Zauber. Both Leni and Victor Creed, A.K.A. Sabretooth, had been assigned with the assassination of a scientist in East Berlin. Mystique completes the mission in place of Leni, and then she and Victor have to hide in a safe location for a while. They become lovers, but she soon fakes her death to leave him.

The result of this short-lived affair is reportedly the birth of Graydon Creed. A number of stories report that soon after his birth, Mystique gives him up for adoption. Others depict Mystique making arrangements for him from a distance. Raven keeps track of his activities until he reaches adolescence. Despite being the child of two mutants, Graydon is not a mutant himself. Mystique is disappointed and soon abandons him. Graydon grows to hate his parents, and eventually extends his hatred to all mutants. He becomes leader of the mutant-hating organization Friends of Humanity, and then a politician. At the height of his political ascension, Graydon is assassinated by an unknown shooter. The shooter is later revealed to be a time traveling version of Mystique as part of a convoluted time paradox involving Jean Grey, Iceman, Toad, and Juggernaut.

===Nightcrawler===
Still masquerading as Raven, Mystique is married to Baron Christian Wagner (older sources give his name as Count Eric Wagner), an affluent German noble. He proves to be a loving husband, but disappointing as a lover. His infertility adds to their marital problems. Mystique starts using her shapeshifting powers to secretly have sexual encounters with others. From early on, Irene Adler also joined the household as a common housekeeper, secretly Mystique&#x27;s true lover.

Mystique begins an affair with fellow mutant Azazel, pretending to be seduced. Azazel states that he is ruler of &quot;an island nation off the coast of Bermuda: La Isla des Demonas&quot;, The Island of Demons. He is later revealed to be immortal and the father of an ancient race of mutants known as the Neyaphem, active since at least 2000 BC.

Mystique appears to become pregnant, but her husband becomes suspicious and his own father suggests a blood test to verify whether the child is his. Mystique uses a dagger to murder him and then buries him after he discovered the truth. It is revealed that she was using her mutant abilities to simulate a pregnancy in sympathy with Destiny, who was actually the one pregnant. Mystique had in fact, as a deeper function of her powers, replicated the genetics of Azazel and Christian, as well as possibly other men, to become functionally male and impregnate Destiny (after the pair discussed wanting to start a family).

Destiny gives birth to their baby with black hair, yellow eyes, blue skin, and a pointed tail. After showing her true form to him, the locals consider Mystique and the child to be demons and attempt to kill them. Mystique escapes but hides her son briefly, intending to help Destiny escape then return for him. Destiny had escaped on her own, however, and by the time Mystique returned for their son, he is missing. He is found and raised by Roma sorceress Margali Szardos and named Kurt Wagner.

Mystique learned that conceiving Kurt was in part a manipulation by Destiny to produce a child Azazel would assume was his own. Destiny foresaw that Kurt would sabotage Azazel&#x27;s attempt for world domination, which involved gathering several of his children. This would have been successful and catastrophic otherwise. The pain of loss and the stress to their relationship prompted them to seek Professor Charles Xavier some time before his formation of the X-Men for help erasing their memories of Kurt.

Mystique opted to maintain knowledge that she had a son somewhere out there, against Xavier&#x27;s advice. He warned that unlike a fully removed memory, the mind would weave stories to fill the gaps of a perforated one, and the resulting false memories could be uglier than the truth. This turns out to be the reason Mystique herself believed a different sequence of events, believing Azazel to be the father, her to be the mother, and that she had either abandoned Kurt to save herself or dropped him off a cliff to spite Azazel who was just interested in her for childbearing.

Those beliefs apparently also drove her continued coldness towards Kurt despite being reunited for a significant amount of time, fully aware he was her lost son. It may have also had other effects on her psyche. This is also why Destiny is unaware she gave birth to Kurt; and even Xavier is unaware of these events because he considered this a private matter and supposedly also deleted his memory of this encounter.

Mystique revealed the true events to Nightcrawler after her true memories reasserted themselves some time after resisting a psychic push by Xavier and falling off a cliff at the third Hellfire Gala. The experience left her mentally unstable, until she was aided by Nightcrawler&#x27;s &#x27;Hopesword&#x27;, which undid Xavier&#x27;s modifications.

===Rogue===
Mystique becomes the adoptive mother of the fourteen-year-old girl Rogue. Rogue had run away from her home in rural Caldecott County, Mississippi. The girl was living alone in a wooded area, brandishing a shotgun and trusting no one, when Mystique found her. Destiny foresees that Rogue will be important to them and Mystique seeks her out, gains her trust, and takes her in. She and Destiny raise the girl, and Mystique grows to be protective of her.

Mystique, as Raven Darkhölme, rises rapidly through the United States Civil Service to the trusted position of Deputy Director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in the United States Department of Defense. This position gives her access to military secrets and advanced weaponry, both of which she uses for her own criminal and subversive purposes. In this position, she attempts the theft of the Centurion weaponry from S.H.I.E.L.D. As Destiny had predicted that Ms. Marvel was a danger to Rogue, she spied on Carol Danvers and Ms. Marvel for some time prior to beating her lover Michael Barnett to death, and sought to kill Ms. Marvel.

To help her in her criminal activities, Mystique organizes her own incarnation of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, consisting of herself, Avalanche, Blob, Destiny, and Pyro. The Brotherhood attempts to assassinate Senator Robert Kelly, a notoriously anti-mutant politician. The X-Men thwart the assassination attempt, and all of the Brotherhood except Mystique herself are incarcerated.

Rogue is trained by Mystique and eventually joins the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. Her mutant power is the ability to absorb the memories, personality, and skills or powers of whomever she touches. To free the other members of the Brotherhood, Mystique concocts a plan involving Rogue absorbing the powers of Ms. Marvel and the Avengers. Though the plan is successful, the Avengers ultimately defeat the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, capturing all of them except Rogue and Mystique. Moreover, Rogue finds that she has absorbed Ms. Marvel&#x27;s memories, personality, and powers permanently. In a further humiliation, a confrontation at the Pentagon ends with Mystique being defeated and turned over to the authorities by a powerless Ms. Marvel.

The Brotherhood of Evil Mutants eventually escape, and battle against Dazzler. In an act of revenge against Mystique, Mastermind unbalances Rogue&#x27;s psyche with the one she absorbed from Ms. Marvel, which prompts her to defect to the X-Men. Because Rogue left without a word, Mystique assumes that Professor X, the X-Men&#x27;s mentor, brainwashed her. The Brotherhood of Evil Mutants accordingly launches an attempt to kill Professor X. Rogue stops Mystique, and explains that she joined the X-Men because Professor X, as the world&#x27;s most powerful telepath, is her best hope of healing for her fragmented psyche. Mystique reluctantly relinquishes her guardianship of Rogue.

===Freedom Force===
Anti-mutant sentiment rises and the federal government launches its own covert anti-mutant program, Project Wideawake. Believing that the times have become too dangerous for the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants to continue, Mystique goes to Valerie Cooper, special assistant to the head of the National Security Council, and offers the Brotherhood&#x27;s services to the government. In return for entering government service, Mystique and her team receive a presidential pardon for all criminal charges, to be revoked if any member of Freedom Force is found committing a crime. Cooper agrees to convey the offer to the President on the condition that the Brotherhood arrests their founder, Magneto. The Brotherhood, now reincarnated as Freedom Force, are defeated by Magneto and the X-Men. When Magneto learns that Freedom Force are official federal agents, he voluntarily surrenders to them.

Mystique leads Freedom Force in capturing the Avengers on behalf of the federal government. She clashes with X-Factor in seeking to arrest Rusty Collins. With Freedom Force, she fights the X-Men in Dallas, and witnesses her foster daughter&#x27;s apparent demise. With Freedom Force, she battles Cyclops and Marvel Girl. With Freedom Force she seeks to arrest Rusty Collins again, and battles the New Mutants. She finally succeeds in capturing Collins as well as Skids. She leads Freedom Force against the Reavers on Muir Island. On this particularly disastrous mission, Freedom Force loses two of its members, Stonewall and Mystique&#x27;s lover Destiny. The death of her lover leaves Mystique psychologically scarred.

Mystique is later nearly killed by Valerie Cooper, who is under the Shadow King&#x27;s control. She then impersonates Cooper. Mystique is eventually discovered and saves Xavier by killing the Shadow King&#x27;s human host, Jacob Reisz. She finally reconciles with Rogue. In time, she comes to terms with Destiny&#x27;s death. She teams with Spiral and Wolverine in thwarting Mojo&#x27;s near-destruction of the universe. Mystique later briefly stays as a guest at Xavier&#x27;s mansion. She begins going insane, and leaves the mansion under the care of Forge.

===X-Factor===
Mystique resurfaces several months later, in a failed attempt to kill Legion for his murdering of Destiny. Mystique has an implant put in her skull by Forge for the government to be able to keep track of her. She is then forced to become a member of the government-sponsored team X-Factor after being arrested for trying to blow up a dam. In truth, Mystique had been trying to save the dam, which the U.S. Government wanted to destroy so that they could blame it on mutants. Her membership leads to tension with her teammates when Sabretooth is added to the team months later as a sleeper agent, for the main purpose of killing Mystique before she can uncover the truth about the conspiracy. She slowly develops a romantic relationship with team-leader Forge (though he later thought that she was just using him).

Part of the conspiracy involves Mystique&#x27;s son Graydon Creed running for President, under an anti-mutant platform.

At the same time, both Graydon and Mystique learn that Destiny married and had children during one of the couple&#x27;s separations. Destiny/Irene&#x27;s children are now adults with their own children, one of which is a mutant. Graydon has the mutant teen savagely beaten by members of the Friends of Humanity, as a warning towards his mother. Mystique is furious and wants to kill her son, but stops when she is given a message that Graydon&#x27;s backers want her to kill him and turn her son into a martyr.

Mystique then seeks to save her son from being betrayed by his backers, but fails. Graydon&#x27;s death ushers in a new wave of anti-mutant violence. Sabretooth acts on his orders to kill the members of X-Factor as &quot;Operation Zero Tolerance&quot; is activated. Mystique distracts Sabretooth long enough to keep him from finishing off the team. Mystique then flees the scene after arranging for X-Factor to receive medical treatment for the wounds Sabretooth inflicted.

Mystique goes into hiding, taking the identity of the senator&#x27;s wife Mallory Brickman, using her husband&#x27;s influence to set the FBI on Sabretooth. She prevents Rogue from giving up her mutant powers and continues her investigation of the U.S. Government over her son&#x27;s death, leading to her aiding Toad and his most recent incarnation of the Brotherhood of Mutants on a mission to raid a government base. The mission fails thanks to Machine Man, who fights the Brotherhood and forces the team to flee. Mystique flees to Europe. While taking the form of a blonde haired woman, Mystique is confronted by a famous photographer who proposes to make her a big fashion model.

Amused, Mystique accepts and quickly becomes the fashion industry&#x27;s newest top model. Using her money, Mystique moves back to New York and into an expensive penthouse apartment. There, Skrulls staying in a nearby building frame Mystique for the murder of a Japanese diplomat. With help from Shadowcat and Rogue, Mystique is cleared and leaves town. Before she leaves, Shadowcat finds one of Destiny&#x27;s diaries, left there by Destiny herself before she died.

===Breakdown===
While gaining critical intelligence on the identity of those who were involved in her son&#x27;s death and the attempt to kill her using Sabretooth, Mystique suddenly loses her powers while pretending to be a man in a busy office workplace.

Mystique is arrested. The U.S. Government acts on their intelligence regarding Mystique, and destroys all of the alternate identities that she established over the years and confiscate the money she and Destiny had hidden away. The loss of her powers and her freedom causes her to lash out at everyone around her. Rogue has no sympathy for Mystique&#x27;s plight. The relationship sours when Rogue refuses to tell Mystique that the X-Men are going to fight the High Evolutionary, who was responsible for depowering all mutants, to restore everyone&#x27;s powers. The X-Men defeat the High Evolutionary and restore everyone&#x27;s powers, allowing Mystique to escape jail.

Mystique is sent back in time by the original X-Factor&#x27;s sentient ship. Raven finds that she is destined to be part of a great time paradox, where she finds herself with a time delay weapon, which she is about to program to kill Graydon. After some deliberation, she decides to activate the weapon to kill Graydon. Mystique&#x27;s sanity is further damaged by the revelation that Destiny was one of the founding members of the anti-mutant conspiracy Mystique had dedicated countless years to fighting, and had willfully withheld medical treatment to mutant children that would have resulted in them not growing up deformed due to their mutations.

This leads to Raven again going mad. She reforms the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants for another assassination attempt on Senator Kelly, and kidnaps Moira MacTaggert and impersonates her to access her research on the Legacy Virus. Mystique uses samples of the Legacy Virus to create a cure as well as biological weapon that would infect humans and not mutants.

The assassination attempt on Kelly ends in failure when Pyro betrays his teammates. Mystique blows up MacTaggert&#x27;s research facility, fatally injuring the doctor. Mystique then shoots Moira&#x27;s foster daughter Wolfsbane with a prototype of Forge&#x27;s neutralizer gun, depowering her. The X-Men confront Mystique and she is seriously wounded. She tells the X-Men that Destiny had predicted a dark future for mutant-kind, and that the future Destiny foretold kept on unfolding despite all that Mystique had done to prevent it. She believes that the only way to save them is to eradicate all humans.

Mystique is sent to prison, but quickly escapes. She allies with Martinique Jason in an attempt to wrest control of the X-Corps from its founder, Banshee. Outfitted with a device that gives her the ability to generate an electrical charge, Mystique creates the identity of a supervillain named Surge and joins the X-Corps. While Jason mind-controls the other members of the organization, Mystique brings Banshee&#x27;s organization down and slits his throat, leaving him in critical condition.

===Double agent===
Professor X is forced to make Mystique his secret agent, as his previous one, Prudence Leighton, has died and Mystique is the only one suitable to complete the missions. Xavier poses as Magneto to rescue Mystique from the Department of Homeland Security and from execution at the hands of Johny Kitano, Special Magistrate for Homo Superior crimes against humanity, and a mutant himself. At this time, Mystique claims that there is an imposter out to frame her, taking control over the Brotherhood and sending them on their recent missions (the assassination of Moira and the infiltration of X-Corps). As long as Mystique completes the missions without killing anybody, Xavier, working with Forge, keeps her safe from the authorities, who are out to execute her.

One of Xavier&#x27;s enemies, the Quiet Man, who is actually Prudence Leighton inhabiting the body of her assassin, contacts Mystique and offers to give her an interference transmitter which would keep her safe from the authorities if she kills Xavier. Creating a plan that would free her from both men, Mystique pretends to try killing Xavier while secretly working with the mutant thief Fantomex, after alerting Forge to stop her at the last moment. Her plan is to have the Quiet Man see this and believe that she really has attempted to kill Xavier and is still working for him. The other X-Men believe that Mystique has tried killing Xavier and seek her out.

Rogue tracks her down. Distraught with rage, she attacks her foster mother. Mystique escapes by blowing up the house and going through the window, changing her form to shield her fall.

Mystique goes to the Quiet Man, who is planning on having her killed. After a battle, Mystique kills the Quiet Man, saves her former field-handler Shortpack, and discovers the Quiet Man&#x27;s interference transmitter was a fake. She tries to steal Forge&#x27;s interference transmitter but is caught. After some angry words, he smashes it and tells her he never wants to see her again. The two share a sad goodbye kiss and Mystique leaves. After Mystique is gone, Forge realizes that she had already switched his transmitter for the fake one.

===Joining the X-Men===
Mystique later infiltrates the X-Men, posing as a young girl named Foxx and joining Gambit&#x27;s training squad, the Chevaliers. She attempts to seduce Rogue&#x27;s boyfriend Gambit to break them up so she can set her daughter up with a young mutant named Augustus, but Gambit resists. Mystique ultimately reveals herself to him, telling him that she is trying to relieve the tension between him and Rogue (because of the two being unable to touch due to her ability to absorb someone&#x27;s essence upon skin-to-skin contact). Mystique then metamorphoses into Rogue and tells Gambit that he would not be cheating on Rogue if he had sex with her in Rogue&#x27;s form.

When the telepath Emma Frost discovers who Foxx really is, the X-Men confront Mystique. Mystique tells them that she had been lonely and wants to join the X-Men. Mystique uses Rogue&#x27;s doubts about what happened between her and Gambit to sow further discord in Rogue&#x27;s relationship with Gambit, but he still refuses. The X-Men vote and decide to have Mystique join them on a probationary status (though Rogue is one of the ones who vote against her joining). Nightcrawler asks her to leave for a while regardless of the vote, saying that he needs more time adjusting to the idea of her being a member. Mystique agrees and leaves. After M-Day, she joins the X-Men and brings Augustus (Pulse) along with her. Both have been crucial in the downfall of Apocalypse.

===Marauders===
After the Hecatomb battle on Providence, Rogue&#x27;s team returns to Rogue&#x27;s childhood home in Caldecott County, Mississippi, which Mystique owns, for some downtime. Mystique alerts the X-Men, who come to treat Rogue&#x27;s illness, that there are intruders in the area. Only after Lady Mastermind drops her illusions do the X-Men realize that it is an all-out attack, and that both Lady Mastermind and Omega Sentinel (the latter being possessed by Malice) have defected sides. During the Marauders&#x27; initial ambush, Mystique prevents Scalphunter from shooting Rogue. She then reveals herself as a traitor as well, shoots her adopted daughter, and orders the remaining Marauders to kill the X-Men.

Mystique remains with the Marauders during the hunt for the first new mutant baby, but is revealed to have murdered Mister Sinister in a plot involving the baby and Rogue&#x27;s killing touch. She also appears to be working with Gambit, who, like her, has ulterior motives to want to betray Mister Sinister. When Sinister approaches Mystique as she is with the comatose Rogue, Mystique shoves Sinister onto Rogue, killing him through fatal skin-to-skin contact. Then, in keeping with the words of the Destiny Diaries, she touches the baby&#x27;s face to Rogue&#x27;s. The baby&#x27;s touch purges her of the Strain 88 virus and all the residual psyches she had absorbed over her life, including Hecatomb. Rogue is sickened by Mystique&#x27;s manipulations, and leaves.

Wolverine tracks Mystique to the Middle East and then into Afghanistan. It is hinted at that Mystique&#x27;s recent betrayal is not the only reason Logan is out to kill her, as they have a common history of friendship, love, and ultimately, betrayal. After a heated fight, Wolverine wounds Mystique, but denies her the Coup de grâce.

===&quot;Manifest Destiny&quot;===
Mystique shows up again, posing as Bobby Drake&#x27;s ex-girlfriend Opal Tanaka. She sets off a bomb inside of Bobby&#x27;s Blackbird before shooting him and kicking him out of the plane. Later, she follows Iceman to the hospital and injects him with a fatal dose of a toxin created by Mister Sinister. Hospital staff try to get to Iceman, but they are held back by Mystique while Iceman expels the toxin from his system. Afterward, Mystique attacks Iceman in a truck and sets the truck ablaze with Iceman in it. Iceman steps out of the fire unharmed and disarms and immobilizes Mystique, but she escapes after turning her body into her child form. Mystique impersonates Iceman and stands on top of the Golden Gate bridge threatening to blow it up. Iceman arrives and discovers the reason for Mystique doing this is Wolverine telling her that she will die alone. After a heated conversation, Iceman freezes the bomb. Mystique jumps off the bridge into the water. Iceman tells Cyclops and Hank McCoy that he knows that she is not dead and thanks her for what she did for him.

===Dark X-Men===
Mystique joins Norman Osborn&#x27;s Dark X-Men, posing as Professor Charles Xavier for P.R. purposes. Osborn has her injected with nanites and kept on a short leash; should she try anything, Osborn would turn her into a human bomb. After Emma Frost, Namor, and Cloak and Dagger defect from the team, Mystique leads the remaining members under the public guise of Jean Grey, as no one could prove Jean had actually died, but mainly to hurt those who had caused her great harm.

Wolverine, having returned from hell and retrieved his possessed body from a demonic force, targets Mystique after finding out she was responsible for sending his soul there at the behest of The Red Right Hand. Mystique is shot by a hit-man named Lord Deathstrike. Badly wounded, Mystique patches herself and escapes on a motorcycle. Wolverine and Lord Deathstrike are in hot pursuit of Mystique throughout the San Francisco streets simultaneously. Mystique ultimately confronts Wolverine, who stabs her with his claws, killing her. Lord Deathstrike collects Mystique&#x27;s body and auctions it off. Her corpse is sold for 5 million to group of ninjas. It is implied these are agents of The Hand.

===Revival===
Mystique is seen alive again posing as Sabretooth at Los Angeles International Airport. In the form of Sabretooth she has agreed to assist the Hellfire Club in their destruction of the Jean Grey School. Mystique, as Sabretooth, was a faculty member of The Hellfire Academy. When the Hand revived Mystique, her powers were enhanced and she is now capable of changing her scent to match the forms she takes.

Receiving word that the original X-Men are in the present day, Mystique seeks out young Scott Summers to manipulate him into thinking she has his and mutantkind&#x27;s best interests at heart. She uses Lady Mastermind and Sabretooth to commit robberies and frame the X-Men. Viper shows up. Mystique explains to her that she wants to buy Madripoor from HYDRA and control the crime in the area. Before this transaction is completed, the X-Men raid the place. Lady Mastermind and Mystique are captured, but Mystique escapes in a S.H.I.E.L.D. helicopter.

Mystique is attacked by Iceman, who is possessed by the Apocalypse fragment. After Iceman is shattered into pieces by Thor, Mystique takes the Apocalypse fragment and swallows it to inherit its powers.

To help move her plans along, Mystique drugs and replaces Dazzler, who&#x27;s now became SHIELD&#x27;s mutant liaison, allowing her to set up her New Brotherhood under Maria Hill&#x27;s nose. She sets up operations in Madripoor, allowing her to regularly visit to &#x27;investigate&#x27; the mutant uprising there, while secretly being the one in charge of it. She offers Magneto a place in her New Brotherhood after he leaves the Uncanny X-Men team, but he rejects it on the grounds of her financing her operation via drug money from Mutant Growth Hormone sales, attacking and defeating her Brotherhood and stealing her chopper to find his own place in the new world.

===Uncanny Avengers===
Mystique appears as a member of Magneto&#x27;s unnamed supervillain group during the fight against Red Skull&#x27;s Red Onslaught form. When the heroes and villains present undergo a moral inversion due to a flawed spell cast by the Scarlet Witch and Doctor Doom, Mystique joins the other inverted villains in the &#x27;Astonishing Avengers&#x27; as they go up against the inverted X-Men and Avengers, also working to prevent the inverted Nightcrawler from killing those who were involved in the riot that nearly killed him before his first meeting with Professor X. During the final fight, Mystique briefly poses as Professor X to try to get through to the &#x27;reborn&#x27; Apocalypse (Actually the now-adult clone of Apocalypse known as Evan Sabahnur that the X-Men had been trying to raise away from his template&#x27;s influence), but is converted back to her usual villainous attitude at the conclusion of the storyline.

===Krakoan Era===
Mystique is sent in with a team of X-Men to stop the launch by the anti-mutant organization Orchis to activate Mother Mold, an incredibly powerful Master Mold made to make other Master Molds that will lead to the Nimrod generation. While they succeed, the whole team is killed in the raid, to then be resurrected on Krakoa.

Mystique is sent on a last-ditch mission to detonate a singularity bomb inside the Orchis base before Orchis leader Alia Gregor completes her own Nimrod prototype, in exchange for moving the resurrection of Destiny to the front. The mission ends in failure, with only the Nimrod containing Alia&#x27;s husband&#x27;s mind being destroyed. A back-up Nimrod is nevertheless still functioning. This leads to Magneto and Professor X forbidding Destiny&#x27;s resurrection—it is heavily implied they had no intention of ever doing this due to her being a threat to Moira McTaggert—and Mystique remembering a promise Destiny made to burn down Krakoa if such an event occurred.

==Powers and abilities==
Mystique is a mutant shapeshifter with the ability to molecularly shift the formation of her biological cells at will to change her appearance and thereby assume the form of other humans and animals. She can also alter her voice to duplicate exactly that of another person. It was recently expanded upon that Mystique achieves shapeshifting by an ability to &quot;rewrite every disgusting trace of sapiens code if she has to&quot; and does not merely shift skin. Mystique has an instinctive command over cells, hormones and ribosomes, which qualifies her as a gene-shaper.

Originally, it was clearly stated that Mystique&#x27;s powers were limited to appearances only; she could not assume the powers of the people she morphed into or alter her body to adapt to different situations. Additionally, she could not change her overall body mass when taking on the appearance of a person larger or smaller, but due to subsequent enhancements she has stated that her body mass is not fixed and can change when she does. It is unclear if some of the unknowns about her abilities were because she is secretive, or because memory tampering affected her understanding of some of them; especially because she admittedly does not claim to know the science behind them all.

Her body is not limited to purely organic appearances: She also has the ability to create the appearance of clothes and other materials out of her own body, including items such as glasses, zippers, identity cards, handbags and even test tubes. Mystique is shown in at least one instance transforming a metallic part of her costume into a functioning blaster pistol.

As a shape-shifter, Mystique is able to constantly alter and rejuvenate her body&#x27;s cells and thereby retain her youthful appearance despite having lived for over one hundred years.

Mystique received her first power enhancement in the &quot;X-Men Forever&quot; miniseries, in which she was exposed to dangerous levels of radiation to save the life of Toad. The process boosted her powers so that she can now morph her body into taking certain desired physical traits depending on her situation at the time. Examples of these new abilities include night vision, wings on her back, talons in her fingers or toes, and natural body armor. She can compress into nearly two-dimensions (like a sheet of paper) to glide on air currents in a fashion similar to that of Mister Fantastic. She has moved her vital organs out of place to survive gunshots to her torso and head, and can make herself virtually invisible via camouflage. She has even, with strain, given herself two heads and four arms to facilitate a gun fight on two fronts, as well as shapeshifted into herself as a small child. She is also now able to hold a shape when knocked unconscious and can conceal items in shapeshifted pouches under her skin.

Following her death and resurrection by the Hand, her powers have been further enhanced. She can now alter and conceal her scent from those with enhanced senses, and is capable of changing her shape to a greater degree, including altering her limbs to form tentacles and bladed weapons, and compressing herself into a dog.

Damage to her biological tissue is known to heal at a relatively fast rate and she can form a resistance to poisons upon contacting them. Her enhancements have allowed her to rapidly regrow severed limbs, and rapidly recover from near fatal injury. Her powers grant her immunity to diseases, enhanced agility and strength, and agelessness.

Mystique is a cunning strategist in terrorist and commando operations, and adept at martial arts and information technology. She has a talent for finding, stealing, and understanding cutting edge weaponry. She is a talented actress and a polyglot, being fluent in over fourteen languages. Her mind is naturally unreadable owing to changing grey matter and she wears devices to prevent telepathic intrusion. Furthermore, with over a century&#x27;s experience in posing as other people she has picked up the unusual skill of being able to identify people posing as others based on body language and changes in behavioral cues.

Having lived for at least a century, Mystique has built up considerable resources, one of her aliases being the billionaire B Byron Biggs who owns a number of safehouses around the world which are often protected by sophisticated security systems. She also controls a variety of weaponry and gadgets, including the &quot;Changeling&quot;, a highly advanced stealth ship capable of cloaking and flying at very high speed. The ship had sophisticated weapons and surveillance systems, with an on-board analysis computer and power-suppressing containment cells.

== Reception ==

=== Critical reception ===
Shoshana Kessock of &quot;Tor.com&quot; called Mystique &quot;one of the most impactful mutant villains in the comics,&quot; writing, &quot;With several independent movies suggested for the ongoing X-Men franchise, we&#x27;ll just have to wait and see if our favorite blue shapeshifter appears beside Gambit and Magneto as a possibility. Fox would really be losing out if they overlooked their opportunity for a kick-ass, sexy, heartfelt and powerful action movie with Mystique.&quot; Peter Eckhardt of &quot;CBR.com&quot; stated, &quot;The shape-shifting Mystique is one of the X-Men&#x27;s most compelling characters. Mystique is primarily motivated by self-interest and is capable enough to get what she wants, be it through espionage, combat, or manipulation. One of the most dynamic figures in the Marvel Universe, Mystique has remained a central player since her introduction.&quot; Richard Chachiwski of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; wrote, &quot;One of the most recognizable villains in all of X-Men comics, Mystique is a blue-skinned, red-haired mutant shapeshifter able to take any physical form she wishes. A frequent adversary to the X-Men, she has also been portrayed as an unlikely anti-heroine in later years. The founding member of her own Brotherhood of Mutants, Mystique is characterized not only by her memorable physical appearance, but also by the various personal relationships she maintains with several X-Men team members.&quot; &quot;IGN&quot; asserted, &quot;Not every great villain has to be a world-conquering, war-mongering, super-powered bad ass. Some of them are simply great at manipulating events to their liking, bending the world to their desire and getting away with it. Mystique is one of those villains, and is absolutely one of the greatest female villains ever created. [...] In essence, over the years X-fans have been treated to a kick ass femme fatale who has found herself at several key turning points in the history of the mutant race. Princess Weekes of &quot;The Mary Sue&quot; said, &quot;One of my biggest issues with the X-Men film franchise is how they have underserved their actresses/female characters. Despite Mystique being known for her pragmatism, spy-craft, intelligence, queerness, and complex family history, all of that, in adaptation, gets chiseled down to spy-craft and that&#x27;s it. The character has a lot more to offer audiences, and considering we, as comic fans, have been denied the entire majesty of Mystique, and how amazing Romijn was in delivering the very basic bones and elevating it to a masterclass, with writers who care, she could be the amazing antagonist we deserve.&quot; Evan Valentine of &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; stated, &quot;Marvel&#x27;s Mystique is about to play a major role in Marvel&#x27;s comics with the upcoming comic book event, &quot;Inferno&quot;, acting as one of the biggest story arcs of Jonathan Hickman&#x27;s X-Men run. While no one knows when the Marvel Cinematic Universe will introduce the blue-skinned villain to its roster, she was definitely a fan-favorite mutant within Fox&#x27;s X-Men titles.&quot;

==== Sexuality ====
Benjamin Riley of &quot;Special Broadcasting Service&quot; referred to Mystique as one of the &quot;queer superheroes who changed the face of comics,&quot; writing, &quot;You could argue that shapeshifting, femme-fatale Mystique&#x27;s bisexuality makes her another negative example of the &#x27;bisexual villain&#x27; trope in popular culture, but given she&#x27;s one of comics&#x27; most interesting superhero characters I think she pulls it off. Brutally intelligent and morally opaque, Raven Darkholme has a prominent X-Men villain, and occasional ally, for decades. Her co-creator Chris Claremont has said Mystique was always meant to have been in a romantic, same-sex relationship with her long-time partner Destiny, but Marvel Comics&#x27; then-edict on same-sex romance meant this had to be revealed in hindsight, years after Destiny&#x27;s character had been killed off.&quot; Matthew Kang of &quot;MovieWeb&quot; described Mystique an &quot;allegory for the LGBTQ+ experience,&quot; saying, &quot;Some mutants choose to hide that they are a mutant. Others publicly embrace that aspect of themselves. While the Marvel universe is not the most welcoming towards mutants, Raven Darkholme (Mystique) chooses to accept herself and declares that she is &quot;mutant and proud.&quot; In the real world, allies and members of the LGBTQ+ community wave the rainbow flag. June is Pride Month, a time when people celebrate the freedom to be themselves.&quot; Samantha Puc of &quot;Newsarama&quot; called Mystique and Destiny&#x27;s relationship one of the &quot;most iconic LGBTQIA+ comics romances,&quot; writing, &quot;Though it remains to be seen whether it&#x27;s a good thing or a bad thing, longtime villains-turned-Krakoan politicians Mystique and Destiny are mutantkind&#x27;s current power couple, following Destiny&#x27;s resurrection and their upending of the Quiet Council&#x27;s status quo in the recent Inferno limited series. And they&#x27;ve certainly earned their place as mutant matriarchs.&quot; Sara Century of &quot;Syfy&quot; said, &quot;Mystique has been a hypersexualized seducer of men in many of her comic book appearances since Destiny&#x27;s death, and while that isn&#x27;t inherently a bad thing, it has a tendency to distract writers and readers away from other interesting aspects of her character. Her stories have distanced her from the discussion of her queerness and her potential status as a non-binary character so much as to render it non-existent. Mystique has seldom been given the deeper focus she deserves, even after years of stories in which she appeared as a prominent character. Her relationship with Destiny is still referred to in the context of close friendship in most stories.&quot; Mark Young of &quot;BuzzFeed&quot; wrote, &quot;The shapeshifting mutant not only has a strong history of being with any and all people, she also defies gender on a daily basis. Her onscreen portrayals have been very straight and as a sort of lackey/underling figure, but her comic history shows the queer woman has very much been her own amazing figure.&quot; Beat Staff of &quot;ComicsBeat&quot; stated, &quot;Mystique and Destiny have been written as lovers from the beginning. From their first appearances, the love and loyalty they felt for each other was so palpable that it has to date inspired fanfiction and critical commentary that takes their status as one of comics&#x27; most epic love stories as text. Wherever their story might go, Mystique and Destiny have always had the kind of love that transcends the thoughts, desires, and expectations of the outside world.&quot; Jude Dry of &quot;IndieWire&quot; asserted, &quot;While she&#x27;s only been depicted in her many movie appearances as being interested in men such as Charles Xavier or Magneto, Mystique has been canonically bisexual since 1981. The character has been romantically connected to her companion Destiny ever since their first appearance in X-Men together. The characters are shown dancing together, and the ancient power known as the Shadow King refers to Destiny as Mystique&#x27;s &quot;leman&quot;, an archaic term for &quot;lover&quot;. The antiquated word was likely a ruse to slip past the comic [censors] of the time. Mystique is one of the most famous and beloved X-Men, and making her bisexual would certainly be a boon for the MCU.&quot;

== Literary reception ==

=== Volumes ===

==== &quot;Mystique&quot; - 2003 ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Mystique&quot; #1 was the 25th best selling comic book in April 2003.

==== &quot;X-Men: Black - Mystique&quot; - 2018 ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;X-Men: Black - Mystique&quot; #1 was the 42nd best selling comic book in October 2018. &quot;X-Men: Black - Mystique&quot; #1 was the 400th best selling comic book in 2018.

Mike Fugere of &quot;CBR.com&quot; described &quot;X-Men: Black - Mystique&quot; #1 as a &quot;great villain spotlight&quot;, writing, &quot;Other than that one quibble, from a narrative standpoint the issue is fun and gives a strong voice to Raven. Her inner monologue reads like a character screed written for new readers, telling you everything you need to know about Mystique while still keeping everyone at arm&#x27;s length, which plays to the character&#x27;s strengths brilliantly. If Mystique were to get her own miniseries, or even an ongoing series, we would love to see McGuire take the reins. She has a wonderful understanding of the character, and conveys this fact in a single issue. The artwork is solid as well. Marco Failla (&quot;Ms. Marvel&quot;) is a talent to watch. His panel layout and story beat transitions are smooth and easy to follow (which makes those pesky character tags even more frustrating), and his line work is crisp and reminds us of the works of Oscar Bazaldua. And while the coloring in this issue isn&#x27;t exactly next level, Jesus Aburtov brings enough to the table to keep things aesthetically pleasing. Next to the Mojo issue, this is the best offering from &quot;X-Men: Black&quot; so far. It&#x27;s fast-paced and leaves you wanting more of Mystique, and reminds us that Raven is more than just Jennifer Lawrence in blue makeup. Mystique is a powerhouse of a character, one who, when in the right hands, can drive noir and espionage narratives with ease. Just like the previous entries in &quot;X-Men: Black&quot; this is one to add to your stack if you have even the slightest interest in the character.&quot; Peyton Hinckle of &quot;ComicsVerse&quot; gave &quot;X-Men: Black - Mystique&quot; #1 a score of 91%, saying, &quot;In &quot;X-Men: Black - Mystique&quot; #1, McGuire finally gives Mystique some definitive titles that go beyond &quot;villain&quot; or &quot;X-Man&quot;. We see her not just as a thief but as someone who truly feels as though stealing and committing crimes is a form of art. Her ease and calm demeanor show us a master at work. Her willingness to release the young captured mutant shows what may be the beginning of morals. Of course, the senseless slaughter of an entire office building full of people shows us the exact opposite. Mystique doesn&#x27;t learn some grand lesson or show true emotion, like in Magneto and Mojo&#x27;s X-MEN BLACK issues. But, someone who&#x27;s been around for as long as Mystique has doesn&#x27;t need those things. She just needs the things that make her who she is. [...] &quot;X-Men: Black - Mystique&quot; #1 is the kind of issue that is undoubtedly a good read but definitely could have said more. A few hints about Mystique&#x27;s future could have gone a long way and would&#x27;ve given readers something to look forward to. Still, I thoroughly enjoyed learning more about Mystique&#x27;s personal motives and identity. If you&#x27;re not a fan of Mystique, this issue probably isn&#x27;t for you, since it&#x27;s absolutely focused on her character. If you are a fan, or perhaps used to be a fan, this one is definitely worth a buy.&quot;

==Other versions==
===Absorbed by Rogue===
A copy of Mystique&#x27;s mind, including her memories and personality, exists within the mind of Rogue ever since the events of &quot;X-Men: Messiah Complex&quot;. She converses with Rogue. She also requests that Rogue turn over control of their body. Eventually she is erased by Professor Xavier.

===Age of Apocalypse===
In the Age of Apocalypse timeline, she gave up her adopted daughter Rogue to Magneto and his X-Men. Years later, Mystique is the ferrywoman to Avalon. It is her task to meet the refugees and make sure they meet the guide to Avalon, Cain. Though she works against Apocalypse, she is not much of a hero. She charges a heavy tariff to ferry the refugees to Avalon, taking all of their valuables. This plagues her conscience and she is reluctant to go to Avalon, as she feels that she is not fit to enter. Ultimately, she gets past her guilt to guide her son, Nightcrawler, to Avalon and find Destiny. She and her son form X-Calibre to defeat Apocalypse&#x27;s agents, the Pale Riders and the Shadow King.

===Battle of the Atom===
Mystique&#x27;s future is shown, where she is revealed to be the mother of Charlie Xavier II, the son of Charles Xavier, possessing his father&#x27;s powers and appearance. While disguised as Moira MacTaggert she gives birth to Charlie, but upon birth she tearfully abandons her child. Later she raised her son Raze (conceived by Wolverine, with his mother&#x27;s shape-shifting skills and his father&#x27;s healing ability), who eventually killed her and took her appearance to rule Madripoor.

===Cable&#x27;s Future===
Mystique inquires of Cable &quot;How does [history] judge the part we play here and now in protecting the remnants of mutant-kind?&quot; He says &quot;History is short on specifics&quot; and that it only remembers broad movements, not individuals. She hints at wanting to know how she is remembered, and he comments that her name did survive in a database of his time. Her name is synonymous with traitor, comparing her name to Judas Iscariot. He adds that the information from his time is part of his history, as it was 2,000 years old.

===Earth-14412===
A Mystique from Earth-14412 first appears in the form of unidentified woman in a dark robe and golden skin. In addition, she possesses the powers of her reality&#x27;s Phoenix Force and operates as the Dark Phoenix. She is a member of the Multiversal Masters of Evil and is in charge of the Berserkers consisting of Hound (a version of Wolverine from an alternate reality) and an unidentified version of Thor. Dark Phoenix and Hound accompanied King Killmonger in attacking Echo&#x27;s Phoenix form, Iron Man, and Thor in Asgard where Dark Phoenix summoned her Thor to her side. After briefly engaging Echo, Dark Phoenix, Hound, and King Killmonger retreated after Dark Phoenix&#x27;s Thor was killed by Thor. They alongside the rest of the Multiversal Masters of Evil left Earth-616 to get back to work.

On one Earth that she rules, the Dark Phoenix kills any flying animal that comes her way so that she would be the only one that flies. The Hellfire Church that works for her have their slaves collect the dead flying animals.

Dark Phoenix and Hound were with the Multiversal Masters of Evil when they take over another Earth before they can return to Earth-616. Just then, Ghost Rider arrives to fight them. After using the Hell Charger to knock down Hound and Kid Thanos, Ghost Rider chains up Dark Phoenix and has the Hell Charger drag it. By the time Ant-Man of Earth-818 and Ghost Rider&#x27;s Deathlok companion arrive where the former shrinks Doom Supreme, Dark Phoenix goes on the attack. Deathlok buys Ant-Man of Earth-818 time to get away as Dark Phoenix manages to kill him. After the Hell Charger leaves with Ghost Rider and Ant-Man of Earth-818, Dark Phoenix states that she is starting to hate that car. Doom Supreme tells Dark Phoenix and the rest of the Multiversal Masters of Evil that they need to regroup as he knows where they are going. They will make one more stop before they can return to Earth-616 as Doom Supreme states that &quot;No Avenger gets out alive&quot;.

Dark Phoenix and Hound accompany the Multiversal Masters of Evil in fighting the Avengers and the Prehistoric Avengers where Hound is killed by Prehistoric Ghost Rider. After being repelled where most of her teammates are either dead or defeated, Dark Phoenix returns to her Mystique form and goes to find Doom Supreme where she accuses him of abandoning them when they were getting their butts kicked. She ended up attacking a hologram of Doom Supreme. In a flashback, it was shown that Mystique took on the powers of the Phoenix Force and blasted apart Old Man Phoenix.

Dark Phoenix later appears at the God Quarry and attacks Doom Supreme for abandoning her as he claims that he awaited her arrival. While Dark Phoenix claims that he lied and plans to place her searing lips on his tongue, Doom Supreme removes his mask and kisses her while daring her to try. She later confronts Old Man Phoenix and tries to attack him only to be attacked by the Prehistoric Phoenix Firehair. When Thor meets Firehair, they do a combo attack to knock down Dark Phoenix. Dark Phoenix in the form of a phoenix attacks Echo and Firehair in order to claim the ancient Multiverse energies for herself. They break free and slay Dark Phoenix.

===Exiles===
In the Earth-797 reality, Mystique is apparently a man and goes by the name of Raphael-Raven Darkhölme (and his alias is Mystiq). Much like the main Mystique, he has a relationship with Destiny but due to his gender has a child with her (Claremont&#x27;s original plan for Nightcrawler&#x27;s origin). They are both killed in unknown circumstances and Raphael often goes to their grave sites. On such an occasion, he is about to be attacked by soldiers when the Exiles&#x27; Sabretooth, who had been stranded on this Earth, saves his life. Saying he is in his debt, he joins the Exiles when they come to pick up their teammate.

===House of M===
In the House of M, Mystique is an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. and a member of its elite unit, the Red Guard, alongside Jessica Drew,Toad, and her children Rogue and Nightcrawler. She&#x27;s also involved in an affair with Wolverine, the Red Guard&#x27;s leader. When this unit, in pursuit of their former leader, attacks the heroes &#x27;awakened&#x27; by Layla Miller, the entire squad is restored. With all of reality against them, any personal history is set aside, and Mystique fights alongside the rest of the &#x27;awakened&#x27; without incident.

===&quot;Infinity Wars&quot;===
Deathstrique, a fusion of Mystique and Lady Deathstrike created by the Infinity Gems, appears in the &quot;Infinity Wars&quot; storyline.

===Marvel Mangaverse===
In &quot;X-Men Mangaverse&quot;, Mystique teams up with Nightcrawler and other Brotherhood members. Storm later kills her with a lightning bolt.

===Marvel Zombies===
Mystique appears as a zombie twice in the Marvel Zombies universe. She is first shown disguised as Scarlet Witch to get close to and bite Quicksilver, thus becoming directly responsible for the fast spread of the zombie virus throughout the world. She is also shown fighting alongside zombie versions of Avalanche, Blob, and Pyro taking a direct blast from Cyclops right to the face.

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the Ultimate Marvel universe, Mystique is the former lover of Charles Xavier. During their stay in the Savage Land with Magneto, the young Emma Frost comes under the tutelage of Xavier, and shortly thereafter he dumps Mystique for Frost. Ever since then, Mystique has held great resentment toward Xavier, which in turn makes her loyal to Magneto. She teams up with Forge and helps Magneto escape the Triskelion by taking his place in the prison cell, before she is replaced by Mastermind and Stacy X and given a new assignment. She is hinted to be one of the few who actually knows how Xavier&#x27;s darker side operates, stating &quot;We all bought into Xavier&#x27;s dream until we got a look at the sick brain behind it.&quot; It is later revealed that Emma Frost named Xavier&#x27;s cat after Mystique, after the feline partially destroyed the decor of his office. She briefly appears in &quot;Ultimates 3&quot;, impersonating the Black Widow to distract Tony Stark until knocked out by the Wasp. She is later seen with the few surviving Brotherhood members still stationed in Wundagore.

===Ultimate Universe===
An alternate universe variant of Mystique from Earth-6160 appears in the &quot;Ultimate Universe&quot; imprint. This version is a member of a resistance against the Rasputin family.

===&quot;X-Men: The End&quot;===
In the trilogy book series &quot;X-Men: The End&quot; Mystique is posing as Dark Beast and pretending to work with Mister Sinister. When Sinister murders Rogue she kills him. Gambit later asks her to look after his and Rogue&#x27;s children when he goes off into space.

===&quot;X-Men Fairy Tales&quot;===
Mystique appears briefly in the &quot;X-Men Fairy Tales&quot; limited series&#x27; first issue. She is leading a group of thieves who attack the old monk/Professor X.

<text>Alum Bay is a bay near the westernmost point of the Isle of Wight, England, within close sight of the Needles rock formation. Of geological interest and a tourist attraction, the bay is noted for its multi-coloured sand cliffs. The waters and adjoining seabed form part of the Needles Marine Conservation Zone and the shore and heath above are part of the Headon Warren and West High Down Site of Special Scientific Interest.

==Geology==
Alum Bay is the location of a classic sequence of upper Paleocene and Eocene beds of soft sands and clays, separated by an unconformity from the underlying Cretaceous Chalk Formation that forms the adjoining headland of West High Down. Due to geological folding of the Alpine orogeny, the strata in the main section of the bay are near vertical, with younger rocks with progressively lower dips to the west. The sands are coloured due to oxidised iron compounds formed under different conditions.

Alum Bay Chine begins as a small wooded valley descending eastward from the junction of the B3322 and the road to Headon Hall. It soon broadens into the clay ravine through which the path and chairlift from Needles Park descend to the beach.

==Tourism==

On the clifftop there is an amusement park with fairground rides, souvenir shops and a cafe. During the summer season a chair lift takes tourists to and from the pebble beach below. Alternatively, a footpath leads to the beach via Alum Bay Chine. From the beach boat trips frequently leave to tour the Needles.

==Alum Bay sands==

A traditional product of Alum Bay, and a fixture of Isle of Wight tourist shops, was the creation of ornaments using the coloured sands layered in vials and jars. The sands were also used for sand painting pictures, a popular craft in Victorian times known as marmotinto.

In the past, visitors to the bay could climb the foot of the cliffs and dig out the sand themselves. The removal of minerals from the site is now prohibited by law under provisions laid out in notices attached to the Headon Warren and West High Down SSSI designation.

The Needles Park has a facility where people could make bottles of sand, using sand gathered from the frequent rockfalls. In the past it was possible to buy Alum Bay coloured sand by mail order and make one&#x27;s own sand pictures and bottles at home.

==Transport==
Southern Vectis run bus services from Alum Bay, including two summer-only open top services – the Needles Breezer and the Island Coaster.

==History==

On a map of the area produced around 1590, the bay is named Whytfylde Chine. It is possible that Alum Bay was once fed by a Chine by this name, which has long since eroded away.

Alum Bay sand includes extremely pure white silica, which was once extracted for glass and pottery manufacture.

Guglielmo Marconi moved to Alum Bay in 1897 to experiment with radio. He installed a 40-metre radio antenna outside the Needles Hotel in Alum Bay. Initially establishing communication with ships offshore, by early 1898 he had successfully communicated with stations at Madeira House, Bournemouth and the Haven Hotel, Poole 20 miles away.

<text>The Needles are a row of three stacks of chalk that rise about out of the sea off the western extremity of the Isle of Wight in the English Channel, United Kingdom, close to Alum Bay and Scratchell&#x27;s Bay, and part of Totland, the westernmost civil parish of the Isle of Wight. The Needles Lighthouse stands at the outer, western end of the formation. Built in 1859, it has been automated since 1994. The waters and adjoining seabed form part of the Needles Marine Conservation Zone and the Needles along with the shore and heath above are part of the Headon Warren and West High Down Site of Special Scientific Interest.

The formation takes its name from a fourth needle-shaped pillar called Lot&#x27;s wife, which collapsed in a storm in 1764. The remaining rocks are not at all needle-like, but the name has stuck.

The Needles were featured on the BBC Two TV programme &quot;Seven Natural Wonders&quot; (2005) as one of the wonders of Southern England.

During Storm Eunice on 18 February 2022, the highest recorded wind gust in England was provisionally recorded at The Needles, at .

LB&amp;SCR H2 class 4-4-2 no. 423 (later no. B423 and 2423) was named &quot;The Needles&quot; after this landmark.

==Tourism==
The Needles lie just to the southwest of Alum Bay, and are a tourist draw. Scenic boat trips operate from Alum Bay that offer close-up views of the Needles and the lighthouse. They have become icons of the Isle of Wight, often photographed by visitors, and are featured on many of the souvenirs sold throughout the island.

The main tourist attractions of the headland itself are the two gun batteries, the experimental rocket testing station, and the four coastguard cottages owned by the National Trust. A branch of the National Coastwatch Institution is also based at the Needles, sited near the New Battery and Rocket Testing Site on High Down. The Needles – Landmark Attraction (previously known as The Needles Pleasure Park) situated at the top of the cliff at Alum Bay is a small amusement park. A chairlift operates between the park and the beach.

==Military use==

The Needles were a site of a long-standing artillery battery, from the 1860s to 1954, which was eventually decommissioned.

A nearby site on High Down was employed in the testing of rockets for the British ICBM programme. The headland at High Down was used for Black Knight and Black Arrow rocket engine tests from 1956 to 1971. During the peak of activity in the early 1960s some 240 people worked at the complex, while the rockets were built in nearby East Cowes. These rockets were later used to launch the Prospero X-3 satellite. The site is now owned by the National Trust, and is open to the public. Concrete installations remain, but the buildings that were less durable have either been demolished or were torn down by the elements.

In 1982, Prince Charles officially opened the restored Needles Old Battery facility. Underground rocket testing rooms are currently being restored for exhibition. The first phase of restoration was completed in 2004.

===Access===

The batteries are accessible by car, foot, bicycle, and bus. Though there is a paved road up to The Old and The New batteries, access is on foot, from a car park. The battery site becomes dangerous in high winds and is closed to the public in winds above force 8.

In the spring and summer, the Southern Vectis bus company sends open-top buses along a route called &quot;The Needles Breezer&quot;. This route approaches the Battery along the cliff edge, using a road reserved for bus traffic. &quot;The Needles Breezer&quot; also has stops in Alum Bay, Totland, Colwell Bay, Fort Victoria, Yarmouth, and Freshwater Bay. &quot;Breezer&quot; buses are the only vehicles allowed on the road from Alum Bay, apart from those owned by National Trust staff or, by prior appointment, vehicles transporting disabled visitors. This is because the single track road&#x27;s position close to the cliff edge is considered dangerous for multiple car use.

The Isle of Wight Coast Path has its westernmost point at the Coastguard Cottages.

==Geology==

The Needles&#x27; pointed shape is a result of their unusual geology. The strata have been so heavily folded during the Alpine Orogeny that the chalk is near vertical. This chalk outcrop runs through the centre of the Island from Culver Cliff in the east to the Needles in the west, and then continues under the sea to the Isle of Purbeck, forming Ballard Cliff (near Swanage), Lulworth Cove and Durdle Door. At Old Harry Rocks (east of Studland and north of Swanage) these strata lines moving from horizontal to near vertical can be seen from the sea.

The shape of the lost &quot;Lot&#x27;s Wife&quot; stone column, recorded as collapsing in 1764, is subject to some speculation. A drawing of The Needles by Dutch landscape artist Lambert Doomer (1624–1700), made in 1646, depicts a rock formation with much stouter shape than that shown in Isaac Taylor&#x27;s 1759 &quot;one inch&quot; map of Hampshire. The Doomer etching is contained in Atlas Blaeu-Van der Hem (published ca. 1662), which is in the Austrian National Library in Vienna. It is not clear from this drawings what transpired and whether Doomer was exercising artistic license. Doomer&#x27;s painting shows three stacks when there should have been four, prior to the collapse of &quot;Lot&#x27;s Wife&quot;.

Just off the end of The Needles formation is the Shingles, a shifting shoal of pebbles just beneath the waves. The Shingles is approximately three miles in length. Many ships have been wrecked on the Shingles and three notable vessels on The Needles themselves: HMS &quot;Assurance&quot; in the 18th century, HMS &quot;Pomone&quot; in the 19th, and SS &quot;Varvassi&quot; in 1947.

<text>The Minnesota Lynx are an American professional basketball team based in Minneapolis. The Lynx compete in the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA) as a member of the Western Conference. The team won the WNBA title in 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2017.

Founded prior to the 1999 season, the team is owned by Glen Taylor, who is also the majority owner of the Lynx&#x27; NBA counterpart, the Minnesota Timberwolves. The franchise has been home to players such as Katie Smith, Seimone Augustus, native Minnesotan Lindsay Whalen, Maya Moore, Rebekkah Brunson, and Sylvia Fowles.

The Lynx have qualified for the WNBA playoffs in 15 of their 26 years.

==History==
===Joining the league (1998–2004)===
On April 22, 1998, the WNBA announced they would add two expansion teams (Minnesota and the Orlando Miracle) for the 1999 season. The team was officially named the Minnesota Lynx on December 5, 1998. The Lynx started their inaugural season in 1999 with 12,122 fans in attendance to watch the first regular-season game against the Detroit Shock at Target Center. The Lynx defeated Detroit 68 – 51 in the franchise&#x27;s first game. They finished their first season 15–17 overall and held the same record in 2000.

In 2001, the Lynx took a turn for the worse as they posted a 12–20 record.

The Lynx&#x27; first head coach, Brian Agler, was released during the 2002 season after compiling a 47–67 record in three-plus seasons. Heidi VanDerveer became the interim head coach for the remainder of the season. The team finished the 2002 season with a 10–22 record, worst in franchise history (until 2006).

In 2003, the Lynx hired Suzie McConnell-Serio as head coach. She led the team to finish with a franchise-best 18–16 record and advanced to the WNBA Playoffs for the first time. They matched both of these feats in the 2004 season.

===Seimone Augustus joins the team (2005–2007)===

The 2005 season was one of transition for the franchise. Leading scorer Katie Smith was dealt to Detroit in July and the team stumbled down the stretch, missing the playoffs for the first time in three years. The poor finish did pay off however, as the team won the draft lottery and selected All-American guard Seimone Augustus of Louisiana State University with the first overall pick in the 2006 WNBA draft.

The Lynx began the 2006 season as the youngest team in the WNBA. On May 31, the team set the WNBA single-game scoring record (at the time), routing the Los Angeles Sparks by a score of 114–71. Despite this victory and with her team floundering to an 8–15 record, head coach McConnell-Serio resigned on July 23. She was replaced by assistant Carolyn Jenkins, who piloted the squad to a 2–9 finish. The team&#x27;s 24 losses set a franchise record.

Following the season, Augustus was named the 2006 WNBA Rookie of the Year. Her 21.9 points per game is still a WNBA rookie record. The 22-year-old was the second player in team history to win the award.

On December 13, 2006, the Lynx named veteran NBA assistant Don Zierden their fifth head coach.

In the 2007 WNBA draft, the Lynx traded center Tangela Smith, whom they acquired in the dispersal draft from the Charlotte Sting, to the Phoenix Mercury for point guard Lindsey Harding, who had been selected first overall.

The Lynx began the 2007 season 0–7, lost ten straight in July and failed to get into the playoff race. They finished tying a league-worst 10–24 record. On November 1, 2007, assistant coach and former head coach Carolyn Jenkins was named Director of Player Personnel of the WNBA.

===Hot starts without results (2008–2009)===
The 2008 season started out much different for the Lynx than in previous years. They came flying out of the gates, going 7–1 in the first five weeks of the season. The Lynx then cooled off. They managed to play competitive basketball all season, but lost many key games down the stretch. The Lynx finished with a 16–18 record in a tough Western Conference where every team was in the playoff chase until the final week of the season. The Lynx however, did not qualify. After two consecutive 10–24 seasons, the 2008 Lynx was a step in the right direction.

In 2009, Zierden resigned just days before the start of the season. Jennifer Gillom who replaced Teresa Edwards as an assistant coach the previous year, was promoted to head coach. Another Zierden Lynx assistant, former NBA player Jim Petersen stayed with Gillom during the season, working with post players Charde Houston and Nicky Anosike. The Lynx saw similar results in 2008. They started with a good run (7–3), but lost many key games, including a six-game losing streak, and finished 14–20, out from the playoffs for the fifth straight season.

===A new team and the first championship (2010–2011)===

After five disappointing seasons, the off-season brought much more impact to the franchise. The team hired former Detroit Shock assistant coach Cheryl Reeve as their new head coach, parting ways with Jennifer Gillom, who took the head coaching job of the Los Angeles Sparks. The Lynx also made some moves in the off-season by selecting Rebekkah Brunson in the Sacramento Monarchs dispersal draft, and trading their first overall pick of the 2010 WNBA draft and Renee Montgomery to the Connecticut Sun for former Minnesota Gopher Lindsay Whalen and the second overall pick. They added free agent Hamchétou Maïga to the lineup, and selected University of Virginia guard Monica Wright with the second pick in the 2010 Draft. With these off-season transactions, the Lynx looked forward to a much improved 2010 season, which was echoed by the eighth annual WNBA general manager poll – 45% of the general managers declared the Lynx the most-improved team as the 2010 season began.

The selection of Maya Moore during the 2011 WNBA draft led many people to believe the Lynx to be championship contenders for the 2011 season. The team finally lived up to expectations in 2011, behind stellar play from Seimone Augustus, Rebekkah Brunson, Moore, and Whalen, all of whom were named to the 2011 Western Conference All-Star Team. The Lynx went into the All-Star break with a 10–4 record, good for first place in the conference. After losing to Phoenix in a 112–105 contest at Target Center on July 13, the Lynx went on a nine-game winning streak, at the time a franchise record and the longest in the league for 2011. The team finished with a 27–7 record, best in the WNBA and in team history.

The Lynx earned the top overall seed in the 2011 WNBA Playoffs. In the first round, they defeated the San Antonio Silver Stars two-games-to-one in the best of three series. The Lynx then swept the Phoenix Mercury in two games to win their first conference championship. In the Finals, the Lynx trailed at halftime in each game, but rallied each time to sweep the Atlanta Dream in three games, securing their first WNBA title, and the first professional championship for the state of Minnesota since the Minnesota Twins won the World Series in 1991. Seimone Augustus was named Finals MVP.

===Road to more championships (2012–2017)===

In 2012, the team began the season 10–0, a franchise and league record. They clinched a playoff berth on August 19, 2012, just 21 games into the season. The team fell to the Indiana Fever in the 2012 WNBA Finals.

The Lynx used both the loss in the Finals and prognosticators&#x27; pre-season focus on the Phoenix Mercury&#x27;s new phenom, Brittney Griner, to motivate themselves for the 2013 season. The Lynx once again had the best record in the West. They completed their comeback, sweeping through the playoffs en route to their second championship in three years, once again defeating the Atlanta Dream. Maya Moore, showing why she&#x27;s now a superstar in the WNBA, won the 2013 WNBA Finals MVP. In doing so, the Lynx became the second WNBA team and fifth major professional sports franchise to sweep through the postseason.

In 2014, the Lynx again had a successful regular season, claiming the second best record in the league, second only to Griner and the Mercury. However, in the playoffs, the Mercury bested them 2-1 in a three-game series, and the Lynx failed to make the finals for the first time since the 2010 season.

In 2015, two-time Defensive Player of the Year Sylvia Fowles of the Chicago Sky held out of her contract until her wish was granted in July to play for Minnesota. The Lynx would go on to win their third franchise title, all three of them in a five-year span dating back to 2011. Fowles proved herself to be a crucial addition, earning finals MVP honors.

After winning the WNBA title in 2015, the Lynx qualified to the 2016 WNBA Playoffs as the top seed with a franchise record 28–6 finish, only entering in the semi-finals to face the Phoenix Mercury. Due to the Target Center entering a renovation, the team moved to the Xcel Energy Center in Saint Paul, where the Lynx played the 2017 regular season. A sweep of the Mercury qualified the Lynx for their fifth finals in six years, with the adversary being the Los Angeles Sparks. The Lynx would not repeat their title, as the Sparks edged out the Lynx in a five-game series, eventually winning game 5 by 1 point.

On August 18, 2017, the Lynx set two WNBA records in their 111–52 defeat of the Indiana Fever: largest margin of victory (59 points) and longest unanswered scoring run (37 consecutive points). The Lynx finished as the top seed in the league, finishing 27–7. In the semi-finals, the Lynx defeated the Washington Mystics in a three-game sweep to advance to the WNBA Finals for the sixth time in seven years. The Lynx avenged 2016&#x27;s Finals loss to the Sparks by defeating them in five games to win their fourth championship in seven seasons and tying the now-defunct Houston Comets for most WNBA championship titles.

===The end of a dynasty (2018–2022)===
In 2018, with back-up point guard Renee Montgomery leaving in free agency to sign with the Atlanta Dream and a now aging roster intact, the Lynx would start falling way short of championship contention. Although Moore, Fowles, Augustus and Brunson made All-Star appearances, the Lynx finished as the number 7 seed in the league with an 18–16 record. This was the first time in 8 years where the Lynx did not finish as a top 2 seed. Lindsay Whalen also announced her retirement prior to the playoffs. The Lynx started off their playoff run against the rival Los Angeles Sparks in the first round elimination game. They lost 75–68, ending their run of three consecutive Finals appearances, and it was Whalen&#x27;s final career game.

In 2019 and 2020, however, the Lynx would produce players that won WNBA Rookie of the Year with Napheesa Collier and Crystal Dangerfield, respectively.

Sylvia Fowles was the last of the Lynx&#x27;s dynastic five starters (Augustus, Whalen, Moore, Brunson, and Fowles) to retire when she did so after the 2022 season. 

=== Collier era (2023–present) ===
Napheesa Collier became the new leader of the Lynx in her fifth season in the league when she returned for the 2023 season and was named the sole captain, the first time Reeve had done so while coaching the Lynx. Reeve told Winsdr about the rebuild around Collier: &quot;“Phee is the epitome of what we want to see. A selfless person, emotionally mature, and handles ups and downs in a way that’s just really impressive... We’re trying to make sure we’re giving her a team that she wants to play with and there’s a clear direction with our team and who we’re putting around her. That’s important to us.”

With their June 11, 2024, win against the Las Vegas Aces in Vegas, the Lynx became the first WNBA team to have all five starting players each score 14+ points, 4+ rebounds, and 1+ 3 pointers.

With a score of 94-89, the Lynx won the 2024 WNBA Commissioner&#x27;s Cup championship against the Liberty in their June 25, 2024, game playing in New York. Napheesa Collier was named the MVP for the championship. Collier said Bridget Carleton deserved the award for her performance in the game.

The team&#x27;s 90-80 win against the Indiana Fever on August 24, 2024, clinched a playoff spot for the franchise. The game set a record for the franchise single game regular season attendance with 19,023; this is the second best attendance for any Lynx home game overall, behind only Game 5 of the 2016 WNBA Finals (19,423). The Lynx retired Maya Moore&#x27;s jersey in a ceremony after the game.

===Uniforms===
The home uniforms are white with blue and silver trim. The team jerseys bear the logo of the team&#x27;s jersey sponsor, the Mayo Clinic, in blue. The road uniforms are blue with silver and white trim and the sponsor logo written in silver. The Lynx previously used an Adidas uniform that was standard throughout the league, but the WNBA partnered with Nike, Inc. for eight years beginning in 2018. The Lynx are also one of 11 WNBA teams sponsored by Verizon, whose logo is also prominently featured on their uniforms.

During the 2016 season, the white uniforms were temporarily replaced by a new silver uniform. This was part of a league-wide initiative for its 20th season, in which all games featured all-color uniform matchups.

In 2021, the WNBA worked with Nike to redesign team uniforms. For the Lynx, this resulted in three versions, dubbed as Heroines, Explorers, and Rebels. The Heroine version was white with blue and green stripes and blue numbers. The Explorer uniform was blue with green and black trim and white numbers. The Rebel edition was black with black stars, white and silver trim, and white numbers. The team was abbreviated to MINN on the front of this jersey, which was inspired by the adjacent legendary music club First Avenue.

In 2023, the team unveiled updated Rebel versions of its uniform, which is black with green trim and white and green letters and numbers. This design includes &quot;Change starts with us&quot; down the side of the jerseys and on the front of the shorts. This refers back to 2016 when the team wore warm ups with that phrase to call for social justice and protest the murders of two Black men by police. The four stripes on the side of the uniforms represent the team&#x27;s four championships.

===Lynx Foundation===
The Minnesota Lynx Foundation holds an annual &quot;Catwalk for a Cure&quot; event at the Mall of America during the WNBA&#x27;s Breast Health Awareness Week to raise funds for breast cancer related charities. The 2011 event was held Aug 5 and raised $5,000 for Susan G. Komen for the Cure.

In 2012, the Lynx hosted the Catwalk for a Cure at the Mall of America rotunda for the first time, occupying the largest staging area inside the country&#x27;s biggest mall. In addition to displaying outfits, Lynx players ended the show with a dance based on the song &quot;Background&quot; by Lecrae and Andy Mineo. The Lynx Foundation donated a $5,000 grant to the SAGE program, run by the Minnesota Department of Health.

During the WNBA&#x27;s 2013 Breast Health Awareness Week and in partnership with the Edith Sanford Breast Cancer Foundation, the Lynx game against the Indiana Fever on August 25 was a &quot;Pink Out&quot; game at Target Center and on August 29, the 5th annual &quot;Catwalk for a Cure&quot; event was held at the Mall of America. The Lynx donated a $10,000 grant to the Edith Sanford Breast Cancer Foundation.

<text>Flavius Julius Crispus (; 300 – 326) was the eldest son of the Roman emperor Constantine I, as well as his junior colleague (&quot;caesar&quot;) from March 317 until his execution by his father in 326. The grandson of the &quot;augustus&quot; Constantius I, Crispus was the elder half-brother of the future &quot;augustus&quot; Constantine II and became co-&quot;caesar&quot; with him and with his cousin Licinius II at Serdica, part of the settlement ending the Cibalensean War between Constantine and his father&#x27;s rival Licinius I. Crispus ruled from Augusta Treverorum (Trier) in Roman Gaul between 318 and 323 and defeated the navy of Licinius I at the Battle of the Hellespont in 324, which with the land Battle of Chrysopolis won by Constantine forced the resignation of Licinius and his son, leaving Constantine the sole &quot;augustus&quot; and the Constantinian dynasty in control of the entire empire. It is unclear what the legal status of the relationship Crispus&#x27;s mother Minervina had with Constantine was; Crispus may have been an illegitimate son.

Crispus&#x27;s tutor in rhetoric was the Late Latin historian of Early Christianity Lactantius. After his elevation to imperial rank, at which point he was also entitled &quot;princeps iuventutis&quot; (&quot;Prince of Youth&quot;), the Latin rhetorician Nazarius composed a panegyric preserved in the &quot;Panegyrici Latini&quot;, which honoured Crispus&#x27;s military victories over the Franks in . Crispus was three times Roman consul, for the years 318, 321, and 324.

According to the Latin histories of Ammianus Marcellinus and Aurelius Victor, after a trial whose real circumstances are mysterious, Constantine executed Crispus at Pola (Pula) in 326. His stepmother Fausta was also put to death, and the Late Greek historian Zosimus and the Byzantine Greek writer Joannes Zonaras wrote that Constantine had accused Crispus of incest with her. After his death, Crispus was subjected to &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot;.

==Early life==
While Crispus’ year of birth is nowhere outright stated, he must have been born before 307. By that time, his mother Minervina was either dead or set aside, as his father Constantine was married to Maximian’s daughter Fausta. 

Constantine entrusted his eldest son’s education to Lactantius, one of the most important Christian teachers of that time.
== Career==
By 313, there were two remaining &quot;augusti&quot; in control of the Roman Empire—Constantine in the west and his brother-in-law Licinius in the east. On 1 March 317, the two co-reigning &quot;augusti&quot; jointly proclaimed three new &quot;caesares&quot;: Crispus, alongside his younger half-brother Constantine II, and his first cousin Licinius Junior. Constantine appointed Crispus as Commander of Gaul. The new &quot;caesar&quot; soon held residence in Augusta Treverorum (modern Trier), regional capital of Germania.

By October 322, Crispus was already married to a woman named Helena, as she bore him a child, a son Flavius, in that month. The Codex Theodosianus recorded Constantine’s celebration of the event.

Crispus was leader in victorious military operations against the Franks and the Alamanni in 318, 320 and 323. Thus he secured the continued Roman presence in the areas of Gaul and Germania. The soldiers adored him thanks to his strategic abilities and the victories to which he had led the Roman legions.

Crispus spent the following years assisting Constantine in the war against by then hostile Licinius. In 324, Constantine appointed Crispus as the commander of his fleet which left the port of Piraeus to confront Licinius&#x27; fleet. The subsequent Battle of the Hellespont was fought at the straits of Bosporus. The 200 ships under the command of Crispus managed to decisively defeat the enemy forces, which were at least double in number. Thus Crispus achieved his most important and difficult victory which further established his reputation as a brilliant general.

Following his navy activities, Crispus was assigned part of the legions loyal to his father. The other part was commanded by Constantine himself. Crispus led the legions assigned to him in another victorious battle outside Chrysopolis against the armies of Licinius.

The two victories were his contribution to the final triumph of his father over Licinius. Constantine was the only &quot;augustus&quot; left in the Empire. He honoured his son for his support and success by depicting his face in imperial coins, statues, mosaics, cameos, etc. Eusebius of Caesaria wrote for Crispus that he is &quot;an Imperator most dear to God and in all regards comparable to his father,” going as far as to compare their relationship to God the Father and God the Son.

==Execution==

In 326, Crispus&#x27; life came to a sudden end. On his father&#x27;s orders he was executed, apparently without trial, at Pola, Istria, in the Augustan &quot;regio&quot; of Venetia et Histria. According to Sidonius Apollinaris and Gregory of Tours, Crispus died through poison. Soon afterwards, Constantine had his wife Fausta killed also, according to several sources in a hot bath or bathroom. Both Crispus and Fausta suffered &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot;, their names being erased from inscriptions.

The reason for these deaths remain unclear. The accounts of Zosimus and Zonaras say that Crispus was executed due to suspicions that he was involved in an illicit relationship with Fausta, but some scholars have been skeptical of this explanation. For instance, T. D. Barnes argues that as Crispus was based at Trier, and Fausta at Constantinople, they would not have had the opportunity to have an affair. While Hans Pohlsander considers Barnes’ argument to be invalid on the basis that Crispus was in the East for long enough, he suggests that the similarity of Zosimus&#x27; story to the myth of Phaedra and Hippolytus makes its veracity doubtful. He does, however, note that Constantine passed multiple laws on adultery in the same year, which may have been related to the deaths of Crispus and Fausta. On the other hand, David Woods accepts the belief that the two were thought to have had a relationship, while suggesting that they were not actually executed. According to his theory, Crispus was exiled to Pola as a punishment for his adultery and committed suicide by poison there, and Fausta&#x27;s death was caused by an attempt to induce abortion to get rid of an unwanted pregnancy that resulted from her affair.

Pohlsander observed that Crispus “must have committed, or at least must have been suspected of having committed, some especially shocking offense to earn him a sentence of death from his own father.” J. W. Drijvers concludes that the true explanation will never be known.

==In literature==
Crispus became a popular tragic hero after the success of Bernardino Stefonio&#x27;s neo-Latin tragedy &quot;Crispus&quot;, which was performed at the Jesuit Collegio Romano in 1597. Closely modelled on Seneca&#x27;s &quot;Phaedra&quot;, this became a model of Jesuit tragedy and one of the main bases for Alessandro Donati&#x27;s 1631 &quot;Ars Poetic&quot; and Tarquinio Galluzzi&#x27;s 1633 &quot;Defense of Crispus&quot;. The play was adapted for the French stage by François de Grenaille as &quot;L&#x27;Innocent malhereux&quot; (1639) and by Tristan l&#x27;Hermite as &quot;La Morte de Chrispe ou les maleurs du grand Constantine&quot; (1645). It was performed as an opera in Rome (1720) and London (1721), where it was entitled, &quot;Crispo: drama&quot;, not to mention Donizetti&#x27;s 1832 opera &quot;Fausta&quot;. The story is also retold and embellished in chapter 31 of Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s novel &quot;Count Robert of Paris&quot;. When Evelyn Waugh reworks the story in his novel &quot;Helena&quot; (1950), Crispus is innocent.

<text>The Detroit Shock were a Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA) team based in Auburn Hills, Michigan. They were the 2003, 2006, and 2008 WNBA champions.

Debuting in 1998, the Shock were one of the league&#x27;s first expansion franchises. They were also the first WNBA expansion franchise to win a WNBA Championship. The team was the sister team of the Detroit Pistons and from 2002 to 2009 was coached by Pistons legend Bill Laimbeer.

In October 2009, it was announced that the Shock would be moving to Tulsa, Oklahoma to play in the new downtown arena, the BOK Center. Former men&#x27;s college coach Nolan Richardson was named the team&#x27;s new head coach. The Shock roster and history was retained along with the Shock name, but the team colors were changed to black, red, and gold. The franchise is currently known as Dallas Wings.

==History==

=== The early years (1998–2002) ===

The Detroit Shock were one of the first WNBA expansion teams and began play in 1998. The Shock quickly brought in a blend of rookies and veterans. The Shock&#x27;s first head coach was Hall of Famer Nancy Lieberman. The Shock started out their inaugural season 0–4, but would put together an amazing expansion season, and finish 17–13, missing out on the postseason by one game.

In 1999, the Shock finished at 15–17, which put them in a three-way tie for the playoffs with the Orlando Miracle and the Charlotte Sting. The Shock and Sting played a one-game playoff, which the Shock lost 60–54.

In 2000, the Shock finished with a 14–18 record and ended up tied for the last seed. This time, the Shock did not qualify for the playoffs as they lost the tiebreaker to the Washington Mystics. Lieberman was fired after the season and replaced by Greg Williams.

In the 2001 WNBA Draft, the Shock selected Deanna Nolan with the sixth overall pick, who later developed into a star. The 2001 Shock finished the season with a 10–22 record, this time tying three teams for last place in the Eastern Conference.
The Shock started the 2002 season 0–10, at which point Williams was fired and replaced by former Detroit Pistons legend Bill Laimbeer. The team finished the season 9–23, but Laimbeer&#x27;s ideas influenced the front office, which included bringing over some new players that he felt were necessary for the Shock to become a contender.

===From worst to champions (2003)===

After massive changes to the roster, Bill Laimbeer predicted before the 2003 season that the Shock would be league champions. The Shock dominated the East in the regular season, posting a 25–9 record and winning the #1 seed by seven games. In the playoffs, the Shock defeated the Cleveland Rockers 2–1 for their first playoff series win in franchise history. In the Conference Finals, the Shock swept the Connecticut Sun 2–0 to reach the WNBA Finals. Despite the achievements, the Shock were viewed as huge underdogs to the two-time defending champion Los Angeles Sparks, who were looking for a three-peat. The Shock emerged victorious in the series, winning a thrilling Game 3 83–78. That game drew the largest crowd in WNBA history. Ruth Riley was named WNBA Finals MVP. With the win, the Shock became the first American pro sports team to go from having the worst overall record in the league to being champions in the following season.

===Return to mediocrity (2004–2005)===
The Shock stumbled after their championship season and played mediocre basketball in the 2004 season. The Shock posted a 17–17 record, qualifying for the playoffs as the #3 seed. The Shock took the series against the New York Liberty the full three games, but fell in the end 2–1.

In the offseason, former Pistons star Rick Mahorn was hired as an assistant coach. Much like the previous season, the Shock played mediocre basketball, posting a 16–18 record, which was good enough to secure the #4 seed. In the playoffs, the Shock got swept by the Connecticut Sun.

===Back to the top (2006–2008)===

The Shock performed well during the regular season, posting a 23–11 record to secure the #2 seed in the playoffs. The Shock went on to make quick work of the Indiana Fever, sweeping them in the first round. In the Conference Finals, the Shock matched up against the Connecticut Sun. This time, the Shock emerged victorious from the hard-fought series, winning it 2–1. In the WNBA Finals, which were now best-of-five, the Shock faced the defending champion Sacramento Monarchs. The Shock lost Game 1, getting handily defeated 95–71 at home. The Shock rallied in Game 2 to even up the series 1–1. Going to Sacramento, the Shock were defeated in Game 3 89–69. With their backs against the wall, the Shock dominated the Monarchs in Game 4, 72–52, setting up the crucial Game 5 in Detroit. Due to a scheduling conflict, Game 5 was played at Joe Louis Arena. At halftime in Game 5, the Shock found themselves down 44–36. However, in the third quarter, the Shock outscored the Monarchs 22–9, taking a 58–53 lead going into the fourth quarter. The Shock held off the Monarchs, 80–75, to win the championship in five games. Deanna Nolan was named WNBA Finals MVP.

In 2007, the Shock sought to defend their title. The Shock finished with a WNBA-best 24–10 regular season record, and captured the #1 seed in the playoffs for the first time in franchise history. In the first round, the Shock were heavily favored against a New York Liberty team that was not predicted to make the postseason. However in Game 1, the Shock came out flat and were defeated 73–51. In Game 2, the Shock won 76–73 to force a Game 3. Game 3 was a battle, as the game went into overtime. In the end, the Shock emerged the victors by the score of 71–70. In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Shock faced the Indiana Fever, with whom the Shock were bitter rivals. In Game 1, the Shock lost by the score of 75–65. The Shock rallied to win Games 2 and 3 by the scores of 77–63 and 81–65, respectively. In the WNBA Finals, the Shock faced the Phoenix Mercury, who had dominated the Western Conference all year long. The Shock won Game 1 108–100 at home. The Mercury evened the series up in Game 2, defeating the Shock 98–70. The series shifted to Phoenix for Games 3 and 4. The Shock won a rough Game 3 88–83.

In Game 5, the Shock were dominated as they lost 108–92. With the loss, the Shock became the first team to lose the championship at home in WNBA history.

The following season, the Shock went 22–12, which was the best record in the East. In the first round against the Indiana Fever, the Shock defeated the Fever in three games. Due to the scheduling of other events at the Palace, the Shock had to play their remaining home games at Eastern Michigan University&#x27;s Convocation Center in Ypsilanti. In the Conference Finals against the New York Liberty, the Shock defeated the Liberty in three games to move on to the WNBA Finals against the league best San Antonio Silver Stars. Although the Silver Stars had the best record in the league in 2008, the Shock swept them to capture their third championship in franchise history. Katie Smith was named WNBA Finals MVP.

===The final season in Detroit (2009)===

Three games into the 2009 season, Bill Laimbeer announced his resignation as head coach. He was succeeded by Rick Mahorn. The Shock struggled in the first half of the season. However, they bounced back in the second half to ultimately finish with a 18–16 record, which was good enough to clinch a playoff berth for the seventh straight year. In the first round, the Shock swept the Atlanta Dream to advance to their fourth straight Eastern Conference Finals against the Indiana Fever. In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Shock were defeated by the Indiana Fever in three games, missing the WNBA Finals for the first time since 2005.

===The end of the Detroit era===
On October 19, 2009, the Associated Press reported that a Shock official stated that the team would be relocating to Tulsa. The following day, the decision was officially announced at a press conference in Tulsa.

==Team identity==
===Logo and uniforms===
From 2002 to 2009, the Shock&#x27;s home uniforms were white with the stylized Shock name in red on the front, while road jerseys were blue with the word &quot;Detroit&quot; across the front in red and white. From 1998 to 2001, a more complex color scheme of teal, yellow and red was used.

<doc id="237119" wikidata="Q692191" url="?curid=237119" title="Arne Carlson">
<text>Arne Helge Carlson (born September 24, 1934) is an American politician who served from 1991 to 1999 as the 37th governor of Minnesota. Carlson is considered a liberal Republican. Before his governorship, he served as the Minnesota State Auditor from 1979 to 1991, and is the most recent Auditor to have served more than two terms as of 2025.

Born into poverty in New York City, he attended the Choate Rosemary Hall preparatory school on a scholarship. After graduating from Williams College, he went to graduate school at the University of Minnesota. In his first race for elected office, Carlson was elected to the Minneapolis City Council in 1965 as a Republican. He served until 1967. With the Republicans in the majority, Carlson also served as city council majority leader. In 1967, he ran for mayor of Minneapolis against incumbent Democratic mayor Arthur Naftalin. Carlson lost the close election.

Carlson served in the Minnesota House of Representatives from 1971 until 1979, then as the Minnesota State Auditor from 1979 until 1991. He launched a bid for the Republican nomination for governor of Minnesota in 1990. He lost the primary election to businessman Jon Grunseth, but Grunseth became embroiled in a scandal weeks before the election and withdrew from the race, whereupon Carlson became the nominee. He defeated incumbent governor Rudy Perpich. In 1994, he easily won reelection to a second term. Since his return to private life in 1999, he has actively and exclusively supported Democratic (DFL) candidates while remaining a Republican.

==Early years, education and family==
Born in New York City, Carlson is the son of Swedish immigrants from Gothenburg and Visby. He attended New York City public schools P.S. 36 and DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx before gaining a scholarship to attend The Choate School (now Choate Rosemary Hall) in Wallingford, Connecticut. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in history from Williams College in 1957 before taking graduate courses at the University of Minnesota.

==Career==

===Early career===
Carlson served one term on the Minneapolis City Council from 1965 to 1967, and was the Republican nominee for mayor in 1967, losing to Democratic-Farmer-Labor incumbent Arthur Naftalin. He was a member of the Minnesota House of Representatives from 1971 to 1979. In 1978, he ran for and was elected state auditor. He was reelected in 1982 and 1986. As state auditor, Carlson worked to create uniform accounting for cities, counties, townships, and special districts, making Minnesota a leader in uniform accounting. He also overhauled the state&#x27;s multi-billion-dollar pension investment portfolio to allow private sector management, which significantly improved the rate of return.

===Election in 1990===

Carlson&#x27;s long tenure as auditor, in addition to his noted speaking abilities, made him a leading contender for the Republican nomination in 1990. But although he initially led in public opinion surveys, his status as a moderate or even liberal Republican made him unpopular among party activists. They instead backed Carlson&#x27;s primary rival, businessman Jon Grunseth, a younger and more right-wing candidate who had never held elected office.

Grunseth defeated Carlson in the primary. In the general election polling, Grunseth was the favorite to defeat the incumbent governor and DFL nominee, Rudy Perpich, the state&#x27;s longest-serving governor. But a scandal arose in mid-October, three weeks before the election, after the &quot;Star Tribune&quot; published a front-page article with an account that, in 1981, Grunseth had invited three then-teenaged friends of his stepdaughter, as well as his stepdaughter herself, to go skinny-dipping in the pool at his home. Although three of the four girls corroborated the report, Grunseth denied any improper conduct, and suggested that Perpich had orchestrated the allegations.

On October 15, 1990, with 15 days of campaigning left before Election Day, Carlson revived his campaign for governor as a write-in candidate, and took part in an unusual three-way debate broadcast by Twin Cities Public Television, which became the highest-rated locally produced program in the station&#x27;s history. Grunseth initially refused to drop out, thus splitting the Republican vote and providing an opportunity for Perpich to win reelection. But nine days before the election—after vacillating for days and after another &quot;Star Tribune&quot; article reported that Grunseth had a lengthy extramarital affair—Grunseth withdrew. As the runner-up in the primary, the Independent-Republican Party Executive Committee declared Carlson the Republican nominee. Five days before the election, in a 5–2 decision, the state Supreme Court ruled that Carlson was eligible to appear on the ballot. In the November 6 general election, Carlson defeated Perpich by 3.3 percentage points, 50% to 47%.

===Tenure===

Carlson was elected the 37th governor of Minnesota and served from January 7, 1991, to January 4, 1999. He won as a member of the Independent-Republican Party. In September 1995, the party changed its name to, simply, the &quot;Republican Party.&quot;

During his administration, Carlson worked to solve an inherited $2 billion state budget deficit. By the end of his term, the state had surpluses of $2.3 billion in FY1997 and $1.9 billion in FY1998. His administration restored the AAA bond rating from all three Wall Street major bond houses. Minnesota was the first state to receive such an upgrade in 25 years.

Carlson increased funding for elementary and secondary education by 9%, created a top-level Children&#x27;s Cabinet to develop a single integrated agenda and budget for all state children&#x27;s programs and initiatives, laid the groundwork for the first light rail in Minneapolis with state and federal funding of $160 million, and got school choice funded, which &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; hailed as a model for the rest of the country.

In 1993, Carlson served as chairman of the Midwestern Governors Association. That same year he signed into law the Minnesota Human Rights Act, which banned LGBT discrimination in housing, employment, and education.

In June 1994, delegates to the Minnesota Republican Party State Convention viewed Carlson, who supported gay rights and abortion rights, as liberal. The party&#x27;s right wing dominated the selection of convention delegates, and Carlson won only 29% of the vote at the convention, with Allen Quist, a figure popular among grassroots Christian right activists, winning 69%. Carlson called Quist a &quot;cult leader with a Messianic complex&quot;, and in the September primary, Carlson and running mate Joanne Benson won renomination by a 2:1 margin, with the endorsement of business groups, every major newspaper in the state, and the Teamsters union. Carlson won the November 1994 general election by a large margin, 63% to 34%, over Democratic nominee John Marty.

As governor, Carlson was known as a fan of the University of Minnesota and its sports teams; his official portrait in the Minnesota State Capitol shows him wearing a letter jacket from the school. He worked closely with the university&#x27;s president, Mark Yudof, on improving its physical plant, and in 1998 proposed and secured passage of a capital improvement package for all higher education with $206 million earmarked for the University of Minnesota. That led to projects ranging from building a molecular and cellular Biology Center to major renovations and upgrades to Walter Library.

=== Post-governorship ===
In 1999, after leaving office, Carlson was appointed to the board of directors of the IDS Mutual Fund Group, which was part of the American Express Financial Advisors, a Minneapolis-based company. He was named chairman and CEO of the board the next year.

Carlson has remained politically active in retirement. In 2010, he announced that he would embark on a &quot;Paul Revere&quot; tour of Minnesota to bring attention to the state&#x27;s fiscal problems. During the 2011 Minnesota state government shutdown, which occurred after Governor Mark Dayton and state legislative leaders could not agree on a budget, Carlson collaborated with Walter Mondale and several other prominent political and business leaders to propose a nonpartisan budget commission.

In a 2001 MPR-St. Paul Pioneer Press poll Carlson ranked second (behind Hubert Humphrey) among prominent Minnesota political figures for their contributions to the state. Fifty-seven percent of those surveyed said Carlson made a &quot;great or major contribution&quot; to the state.

In retirement, Carlson has often endorsed Democratic candidates over Republicans. He endorsed Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election, Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump in 2016, Joe Biden over Trump in 2020, and Kamala Harris over Trump in 2024. He also endorsed Tim Walz over Randy Demmer in the 2010 U.S. House of Representatives election, and the same year broke with his party to endorse Independence Party candidate Tom Horner in the gubernatorial race. In December 2010, as part of a post-election party purge of moderates, the Minnesota Republican Party Central Committee narrowly voted to ban Carlson and 17 others from participating in party events for two years.

Carlson was an outspoken critic of Joan Gabel&#x27;s performance as president of the University of Minnesota.

Carlson and Mondale also teamed to oppose a voter identification amendment to the state constitution in the 2012 election. The amendment was defeated.

Carlson is a longtime campaign finance reform proponent. He is a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One, and has criticized the impacts of the Supreme Court&#x27;s &quot;Citizens United&quot; decision. In 2012, he teamed up with his former rival, John Marty, to support legislation that would prohibit corporations with more than 20% foreign ownership from donating to political campaigns, and to require board of directors or executive councils to approve political contributions made by the corporation or union, rather than allowing executives or presidents to make such contributions unilaterally.

Carlson has been fighting PolyMet, a massive mining conglomerate that used sulfide mining, which can pollute water. He asked why Minnesota was doing business with Glencore. He considers PolyMet an example of the Minnesota government&#x27;s corruption and influence by &quot;monied interests&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Carlson was married to Barbara Carlson (née Duffy) from 1965 to 1977. After their divorce she became known in her own right as a Minneapolis city councilwoman and talk show personality. They had three children. Carlson&#x27;s second wife was Joanne Chabot. They had no children. After their divorce, he married Susan Shepard, with whom he has a daughter. Susan served as First Lady of Minnesota from 1991 to 1999.

<doc id="237121" wikidata="Q160181" url="?curid=237121" title="Tim Pawlenty">
<text>Timothy James Pawlenty ( ; born November 27, 1960) is an American attorney, businessman, and politician who served from 2003 to 2011 as the 39th governor of Minnesota. A member of the Republican Party, Pawlenty served in the Minnesota House of Representatives from 1993 to 2003, and as House Majority Leader from 1999 to 2003. He unsuccessfully ran for the Republican presidential nomination in the 2012 presidential election.

Pawlenty graduated from the University of Minnesota, becoming a labor law attorney and the vice president of a software company. In 1992 he was elected to represent District 38B, a district in suburban Dakota County, in the Minnesota House of Representatives. He was reelected four times and was elected majority leader in 1998. After securing the Republican endorsement, Pawlenty won the three-way 2002 Minnesota gubernatorial election. He campaigned on a conservative platform with a pledge not to raise taxes. He worked to lower the state&#x27;s deficit by cutting funds from state programs and instituting &quot;user fees&quot;. He was reelected in 2006 by a margin of less than one percent. Although Pawlenty eliminated the budget deficit in his first term, the deficit returned as a result of the Great Recession in 2007. The effectiveness of Pawlenty&#x27;s economic policy as governor is disputed.

As governor, Pawlenty also reformed Minnesota&#x27;s education system, passed a concealed carry law, and codified a 24-hour wait period before receiving an abortion. His administration advocated for numerous notable public works projects, including the construction of the Northstar Commuter Rail Line and Target Field. From 2007 to 2008, Pawlenty chaired the National Governors Association.

Pawlenty was rumored to be a contender for both the Republican presidential and vice-presidential nominations in the 2008 presidential election. He went on to co-chair John McCain&#x27;s unsuccessful 2008 presidential campaign. Pawlenty ran for president in the 2012 Republican presidential primary. His campaign fell short of expectations by failing to gain traction. After withdrawing from the race, Pawlenty became a finalist to join Mitt Romney on the 2012 ticket as the vice presidential candidate. He was not selected, but he served as co-chair of Romney&#x27;s campaign until his departure two months before the election. Pawlenty sought a third term as governor of Minnesota in the 2018 election with Michelle Fischbach as his running mate. He lost the Republican primary to Jeff Johnson. As of 2025, Pawlenty is the most recent Republican governor of Minnesota.

==Early life, education, and early career==
Pawlenty was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota, to Eugene Joseph Pawlenty, and his wife, Virginia Frances (née Oldenburg). His father, who drove a milk delivery truck, was of Polish descent, while his mother was of German ancestry. She died of cancer when he was 16. Pawlenty grew up in South St. Paul, where he played ice hockey on his high school&#x27;s junior varsity squad.

Intending to become a dentist, Pawlenty enrolled in the University of Minnesota, the only one in his family to go beyond high school. But he changed his plans and spent the summers of 1980 and 1982 working as an intern at the office of U.S. Senator David Durenberger. In 1983, he graduated with a B.A. in political science. He received a Juris Doctor from the University of Minnesota Law School in 1986. There, he met his wife, Mary Anderson, whom he married in 1987.

Pawlenty first worked as a labor law attorney at the firm Rider Bennett (formerly Rider, Bennett, Egan &amp; Arundel), where he had interned while a law student. He later became vice president of a software as a service company, Wizmo Inc.

Having moved to Eagan, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis–Saint Paul, Pawlenty was appointed to the city&#x27;s Planning Commission by Mayor Vic Ellison. One year later, at age 28, he was elected to the City Council.

Pawlenty entered state politics in 1990 as a campaign advisor for Jon Grunseth&#x27;s campaign for governor. After becoming engulfed in a scandal, Grunseth dropped out of the race just weeks before the general election. After Pawlenty himself became governor, he appointed Grunseth&#x27;s ex-wife, Vicky Tigwell, to the board of the Minneapolis−Saint Paul International Airport, which was called out as an ethics and accountability issue in 2003.

==Minnesota House of Representatives==
Pawlenty was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 1992, winning 49.1% of the vote in District 38B (suburban Dakota County). In the House, he authored bills instituting term limits for committee chairmen, funding for infant parenting classes, minimum sentences for repeat domestic violence offenders, and community notification for sex offenders. In response to a state budget surplus, he advocated reducing taxes rather than increasing education funding. He was reelected four times and was chosen House Majority Leader when Republicans gained the majority in the State Legislature in 1998.

==Governorship==
===2002 election===

In 2002, Pawlenty wanted to run for governor, but party leaders made it clear they favored businessman Brian Sullivan. Pawlenty then decided on the U.S. Senate, but abandoned those plans when Vice President Dick Cheney asked him to step aside and allow former St. Paul mayor Norm Coleman to challenge Senator Paul Wellstone without Republican primary opposition. Pawlenty returned to his original ambition and won a hard-fought and narrow race against Sullivan in the Republican primary.

In the general election, Pawlenty faced two strong opponents. His main rival was veteran Democratic–Farmer–Labor (DFL) state senator Roger Moe. Former Democratic Congressman Tim Penny ran on the Independence Party ticket (incumbent governor Jesse Ventura, a member of the Independence Party, chose not to seek reelection). Until mid-October 2002, all three were essentially tied in the polls. Pawlenty&#x27;s major campaign stances included a pledge not to raise taxes to balance the state&#x27;s budget deficit (while allowing increases in license and user fees); that visa expiration dates be required to be printed on driver&#x27;s licenses; that women seeking an abortion be required to wait 24 hours; enactment of a concealed carry gun law; and reform of the state&#x27;s education requirements. He won the election with 43.8% of the vote. His largest gains after the tied polling were reportedly among voters in the suburbs of Minneapolis–St. Paul.

===2006 reelection===

Pawlenty ran for reelection in 2006. Conservatives criticized him on funding issues, in particular two pieces of legislation for stadiums for the Gophers and Minnesota Twins, and bond issues for public transit, including the Northstar commuter rail line.

The race included Minnesota Attorney General Mike Hatch, of the DFL; Peter Hutchinson of the Independence Party; and Ken Pentel of the Green Party. Pawlenty won, defeating Hatch by less than one percent, though both the state House and Senate gained DFL majorities.

===State budget===
Pawlenty was elected in 2002 on a platform of balancing the state&#x27;s budget without raising taxes. He emphasized his campaign and first term with the Taxpayers League of Minnesota slogan &quot;no new taxes&quot;. His governorship was characterized by a historically low rate of spending growth. According to the Minnesota Management and Budget Department, general-fund expenditures from 2004 to 2011 increased an average of 3.5% per two-year term, compared to an average of 21.1% from 1960 to 2003 (these numbers are not inflation-adjusted). University of Minnesota political science professor Larry Jacobs said that slowing state spending and opposing tax increases were Pawlenty&#x27;s signature issues.

In his first year as governor, Pawlenty inherited a projected two-year budget deficit of $4.3 billion, the largest in Minnesota&#x27;s history. After a contentious budget session with a Democrat-controlled Senate, he signed a package of fee increases, spending reductions, and government reorganization that eliminated the deficit. It reduced the rate of funding increases for state services, including transportation, social services, and welfare, and enacted a perennial proposal to restructure city aid based on immediate need rather than historical factors. Pawlenty agreed to several compromises, abandoning a public employee wage freeze and property tax restrictions.

During his second term, Pawlenty erased a $2.7-billion deficit by cutting spending, shifting payments, and using one-time federal stimulus money. His final budget (2010–11) was the state&#x27;s first two-year period since 1960 in which net government expenditures decreased. Pawlenty has claimed this as &quot;the first time in 150 years&quot; that spending was cut, but fact-checkers disputed this claim as no public budget records before 1960 are known to exist.

Some criticized Pawlenty for providing a short-term budget solution but coming up short in his long-term strategy as governor. The state department of Management and Budget reported that the two-year budget starting in July 2011 was projected to come up $4.4 billion short. Former Minnesota Governor Arne Carlson, a Republican, criticized Pawlenty&#x27;s budget strategy: he borrowed more than $1 billion from the tobacco settlement (money set aside for health care), more than $1.4 billion from K-12 education funding, and more than $400 million from the Health Care Access Fund for low-income families, among other short-term shifts in accounting. The result was a $5-billion deficit, the seventh largest in the United States. Minnesota property taxes rose $2.5 billion, more than the previous 16 years combined, and Moody&#x27;s lowered the state&#x27;s bond rating. Carlson told &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;I don&#x27;t think any governor has left behind a worse financial mess than [Pawlenty] has.&quot; Pawlenty responded, &quot;My friend governor Arne Carlson is, of course, now an Obama and John Kerry supporter.&quot;

====Minnesota Supreme Court case====

While Pawlenty said he was &quot;confident&quot; in his right to use unallotment, the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled against him, 4 to 3, in a May 2010 decision. His budget had been the subject of a lawsuit in Ramsey County District Court, which was decided against him. Judge Kathleen Gearin ruled that Pawlenty had exceeded his constitutional authority in making unilateral spending cuts to a $5.3-million special dietary program that he had unalloted. Attorney David Lillehaug said initially, &quot;This is, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s understating this to say, this is one of the most important court cases in Minnesota legal history.&quot; Pawlenty announced the following day that he would appeal; he filed his brief in February, and arguments were heard on March 15. In May, the Supreme Court affirmed Gearin&#x27;s ruling, writing, &quot;Because the legislative and executive branches never enacted a balanced budget for the 2010–2011 biennium, use of the unallotment power to address the unresolved deficit exceeded the authority granted to the executive branch by the statute.&quot; Pawlenty responded:

I will fight to reduce spending and taxes in Minnesota and that battle continues. My commitment to the people of Minnesota remains the same: we will balance the budget without raising taxes.

After the ruling, as the 2010 legislative session drew to a close, Pawlenty vetoed a budget that would have fixed a $2.9-billion deficit by adding a new tax bracket for six-figure incomes. In response to the proposal, he criticized Democrats for attempting to raise taxes during an extremely difficult economic situation. Eventually, due in part to the efforts of House Speaker Margaret Kelliher, who was running for the 2010 Democratic nomination for governor of Minnesota, the legislature passed legislation approving nearly all the original unallotments.

===Funding projects===
Since the Minnesota Constitution prohibits state-run gambling outside of Native territory, Pawlenty proposed negotiating with Minnesota&#x27;s 11 tribes over profit-sharing of their casinos. Legislators also pushed a proposal to turn Canterbury Park horse track into a racino. The plan was poorly received by Northern Tribes who would operate part of the racino, citing reluctance to compete with other tribes. Tribes with casinos opposed the expanded gambling and some legislators objected on moral grounds that the state shouldn&#x27;t exploit problem gamblers. Politicians in heavy tribal areas feared losing campaign-finance sources if they supported the plan. Delays by the Legislature ended with the bill being pulled from committee. Tribes spent millions lobbying legislatures in 2004.

Pawlenty worked throughout 2006 to fund a Minnesota Twins baseball stadium in Minneapolis. The resulting Minnesota Twins-Hennepin County ballpark bill called for an increased county sales tax, which passed the state legislature and was symbolically signed in at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome. The majority of Hennepin County commissioners did not feel a referendum was necessary to approve the sales tax because of the delay it would cause. Pawlenty and the legislature agreed, citing 10 years of debate, and exempted the county from state law requiring one in the bill.

In June 2006, Pawlenty signed a $999.9-million public works bill that included funding for additional work on the Northstar Commuter rail line (a change in position from reservations about the idea he initially expressed), an expanded Faribault prison, a bioscience building at the University of Minnesota, and science facilities at Minnesota State University in Mankato. The bill also funded a $26-million expansion of the University of Minnesota&#x27;s Carlson School of Management.

In 2011, Pawlenty shut down an Islamic finance program that was part of a larger program to increase home ownership in Minnesota. His spokesperson said the program accommodated the Muslim ban on interest. Adam Sorensen from &quot;Time&quot; questioned whether this was a case of double standards, pointing out New York&#x27;s kosher food regulations, Blue Laws that prohibit alcohol sales on Sundays, and Pawlenty&#x27;s own creation of &quot;The Governor&#x27;s Council On Faith-Based And Community Initiatives&quot;.

===Education===
In the budget process, Pawlenty made an effort to preserve education funding while cutting other government spending. In 2009, he bolstered education funding with federal stimulus grants. Despite this, education funding fell from $9,700 to $8,400 per student (adjusted for inflation) during his tenure. Pawlenty was an advocate of charter schools and was praised by the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools for his education policies. In 2010, the organization rated Minnesota #1 in the country for charter school promotion.

Pawlenty oversaw the repeal of the &quot;Profile of Learning&quot; kindergarten through 12th grade graduation requirements and sought to reinstate them. Renamed the &quot;Minnesota Academic Standards,&quot; they were guided by Department of Education commissioner Cheri Pierson Yecke. The bill&#x27;s first draft raised concern among the education review boards about the amount of content, its age-appropriateness, and a Eurocentric social sciences portion. Yecke revised and expanded material based on the response. Both legislative houses passed the Academic Standards bill, but her confirmation as commissioner was rejected by the DFL-majority Minnesota Senate. She was seen as an outsider coming from Virginia and became unpopular for having pushed the academic reforms during a tight budget session as well as her critical view of Minnesota public schools. In her confirmation hearing, DFLers also expressed concern over her conservative viewpoints.

In June 2006, Pawlenty proposed the &quot;ACHIEVE&quot; program for the top 25% of high school graduates. The program would pay for tuition for the first 2 years (4 years for selected fields such as science, technology, engineering and math) and would cost the state an estimated $112 million per 2-year cycle. The program was not included in the 2007 higher education bill.

Pawlenty used an accounting change called a tax shift to balance the state deficit without raising taxes. School districts statewide unexpectedly lost $58 million in interest and reserve revenue.

In 2010, Pawlenty vetoed a bill that the legislature had passed 110 to 20 (HF 3164), calling for Minnesota State Colleges &amp; Universities (MnSCU) to revamp its credit-transferring system within five years to fix &quot;minimal loss of credits for transferring students&quot; who had been losing between 10 and 30 percent of their credits. Pawlenty found it &quot;unnecessary&quot; because MnSCU was fixing its system already &quot;through internal actions and policy changes&quot;.

===Transportation===

During Pawlenty&#x27;s first term, urban traffic congestion was a significant concern of voters. He appointed his lieutenant governor, Carol Molnau, as transportation commissioner, and the legislature approved the appointment in May 2004. Molnau attempted to reform the transportation department, Mn/DOT, using concepts such as &quot;design-build&quot;. Legislators criticized her performance as transportation commissioner, citing ineffective leadership and management, and removed her from that role in February 2008, a decision Pawlenty said was motivated by partisanship.

Pawlenty favored raising fees and imposing toll lanes on roads as the primary means of discouraging excessive traffic. During his term, the carpool lanes of Interstate 394 leading into downtown Minneapolis were converted into high-occupancy toll lanes. Pawlenty used or threatened vetoes in 2005, 2007 and 2008 on legislation funding proposed highway expansion, infrastructure repairs, road maintenance, and mass transit. The 2008 veto was in spite of Pawlenty&#x27;s announcement that he would consider reversing his opposition to a state gas-tax increase for funding road and bridge repairs in the wake of the collapse of the I-35W Mississippi River bridge.

Pawlenty had opposed the Northstar Commuter Rail as a legislator, but changed his position in 2004, announcing a funding plan to jump-start the project, when the Bush administration determined the rail line was deemed cost-effective and time-saving for commuters.

In April 2008, during the budget bonding bill signing, Pawlenty used his line-item veto on $70 million for building the Central Corridor light-rail project intended to connect Minneapolis and Saint Paul. In vetoing the expenditure, he did not consult Metro Council head Peter Bell, the project leader. Pawlenty said he vetoed the bill in order to send a message to the legislature, which had exceeded his initial budget request, that they needed to &quot;stay focused, be fiscally disciplined, set priorities and solve this budget crisis in a fiscally disciplined way.&quot; But he supported the project and had requested the money in the bonding bill he submitted to the legislature. The veto disappointed some of Minnesota&#x27;s U.S. representatives, including Republican Senator Norm Coleman, who pledged to &quot;raise my voice as strong as I can, as loud as I can. The federal commitment is there.&quot; Pawlenty&#x27;s veto might have delayed the state&#x27;s ability to receive federal matching funds for the project, but Bell said the project was not derailed. The Central Corridor funding issue was resolved on May 19, 2008, with the state pledging the original amount for the project after legislators compromised with Pawlenty&#x27;s budget requests.

There were Republican state legislators who supported other cuts of the bonding bill, including Doug Magnus, the ranking Republican on the House Transportation Finance Division, who praised Pawlenty&#x27;s &quot;fiscal responsibility&quot;. Critics, including Saint Paul Mayor Chris Coleman, called Pawlenty&#x27;s veto &quot;political gamesmanship&quot;, seeing it as retribution for the legislature&#x27;s override of Pawlenty&#x27;s veto of a transportation bonding bill. They noted that cuts overwhelmingly targeted Democratic districts, and Democratic stronghold Saint Paul most heavily.

===Crime===
Crime in Minnesota was a high-profile political issue during Pawlenty&#x27;s governorship. When crime rates in Minneapolis spiked up 16% from 2004 to 2005, city officials blamed Pawlenty for large cuts to state aid, which they said restricted public safety resources. He in turn criticized the city for poorly allocating its funding.

Pawlenty made two large efforts to expand penalties for sexual offenders. In response to his first proposal in 2005, the state legislature passed a large package of sentencing reforms. One new instrument was the possibility of a life sentence without parole for serious offenders. Pawlenty expressed disapproval of the courts&#x27; reluctance to use this option: only seven people received such a sentence in its first two years of implementation. He pushed for even harsher sentences in 2010, increasing the presumptive sentence for first-degree sex offenses from 12 years to 25 and increasing it further for repeat offenders. At the same time he advocated a $90-million expansion of the state&#x27;s civil commitment program for sexual offenders, maintaining that the increased criminal sentences would keep the commitment program&#x27;s cost under control. According to the &quot;Star Tribune&quot;, &quot;A report on Minnesota&#x27;s sex-offender program delivered to legislators in the final days of the Pawlenty administration was heavily edited by a top political appointee to reflect the former governor&#x27;s skepticism about the effectiveness of treatment and to delete arguments for expanded community resources for offenders.&quot;

Early in 2006, after issuing a study that estimated the cost of illegal immigration to the state as approximately $188 million, Pawlenty announced a program for changing the way the state dealt with persons who were in the United States illegally. Pawlenty said that the economic benefits of illegal immigration did not justify the illegal behavior. Pawlenty&#x27;s extensive proposal included the designation of 10 state law enforcement officials as the Minnesota Illegal Immigration Enforcement Team, &quot;trained to question, detain and arrest suspected illegal immigrants&quot; with a focus on &quot;such crimes as human trafficking, identity theft, methamphetamine distribution and terrorism&quot;. He rounded out his proposal with tougher penalties for false identification and instituting a fine of up to $5,000 for employers of illegal immigrants. His proposal was challenged by DFL senators who preferred increased legal immigration to punitive action.

===Energy policy===

Minnesota has mandated a 10% mixture of gasoline and ethanol (gasohol) since 1997. Pawlenty has also lobbied the Governors&#x27; Ethanol Coalition to mandate higher ethanol use nationwide.

Conservative Republican governors were not supportive of Pawlenty&#x27;s presentation on clean energy to the governor&#x27;s association, which he gave in cooperation with Ed Rendell, who was the governor of Pennsylvania and the National Governors Association&#x27;s Democratic vice-chairman. With Kathleen Sebelius of Kansas, Pawlenty was co-chair of the association&#x27;s energy committee. The effort received &quot;adamant opposition&quot; from governors of oil producing states.

In 2007, Governor Pawlenty signed the Next Generation Energy Act of 2007 into law and, along with six other Midwestern governors, the Midwestern Greenhouse Gas Accord. These directed state agencies to develop a plan to reduce greenhouse gases, and &quot;develop a market-based and multi-sector cap-and-trade mechanism&quot;. However, by 2009 Pawlenty had reversed his position and called cap-and-trade &quot;overly bureaucratic&quot; and a potential &quot;disaster&quot;. By 2011, Pawlenty&#x27;s position had changed sufficiently to state &quot;the weight of the evidence is that most of it, maybe all of it, is because of natural causes.&quot;

===Health===
In 2004, Minnesota&#x27;s &quot;Star Tribune&quot; newspaper opined that the credibility of Pawlenty&#x27;s commissioner of health, Dianne Mandernach, suffered when a website posting by the department suggested that abortion might have a role in breast cancer. She also angered many when it was learned she had delayed releasing government research on cancer in miners. In 2007, Mandernach resigned.

In 2005, Pawlenty asked a U.S. Senate subcommittee to allow his MinnesotaCare health plan to expand and continue allowing state residents and employees to import cheaper Canadian prescription drugs.

In 2007, Pawlenty signed into law the 2007 Omnibus Health and Human Services Appropriations Bill, which provided funding for the Health Care Transformation Task Force, a panel of health care experts charged with exploring ways to reduce health care spending, improve quality, and ensure that Minnesota develops a universal health care plan by 2011.

Later in his tenure he used health care funding cuts as a mechanism to balance the state budget. After years of assuring doctors that the state &quot;sick tax&quot; would be used only to fund health welfare programs, in 2009 Pawlenty recommended a 3% cut in physician reimbursements from the state and asked that the sick tax be put instead into the state&#x27;s general budget. Pawlenty used a line-item veto to remove $381 million from health and human services funding, a removal which could lead to 35,000 Minnesotans&#x27; losing their General Assistance Medical Care (GAMC) health insurance in 2011. Hennepin County Medical Center—the largest provider of health care to Minnesota&#x27;s poor and uninsured—closed two clinics, reduced its staff and reduced access to non-emergency services. State Senator Linda Berglin wrote a bill that would extend GAMC funding.

In 2010, he refused federal health care funds including more than $1 billion to expand the number of Minnesotans covered by Medicaid, $68 million for a high-risk insurance pool, $1 million to help set up an insurance exchange where consumers could shop for health coverage, and $850,000 for teenage pregnancy prevention. Pawlenty accepted a $500,000 abstinence-only sex-education grant that would require $350,000 in matching state money. Pawlenty said, &quot;It doesn&#x27;t say we have to apply for all of them.&quot;

===Foreign relations===

Pawlenty&#x27;s first term coincided with the deployment of National Guardsmen from numerous states, connected with the War on Terror and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. During his two terms Pawlenty made trips to Iraq, Afghanistan, Bosnia, Kosovo, and Kuwait visiting Minnesota troops.

Pawlenty was visited in 2004 by Mexican President Vicente Fox in talks to strengthen trade. Fox announced that his country would open a consulate in Minnesota the next year, removing the need for Mexican residents in the state to travel out of state for identification papers and other materials. In mid-2006, in response to illegal immigration, Pawlenty sent Minnesota National Guardsmen to the U.S.–Mexico border at the request of the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

Pawlenty took a delegation of nearly 200 Minnesotan business, government, academic and civic leaders on a weeklong trip to China in mid-November 2005. The stated objectives were to provide a forum for companies to acquire market information, assess market potential, evaluate market entry strategies and identify potential business partners, as well as to promote Chinese investment in Minnesota. Pawlenty also led Minnesota trade delegations to Canada in 2003, Poland and the Czech Republic in 2004, India in 2007, and Israel in 2008.

===Other activities===
Throughout his eight-year tenure, Pawlenty hosted a weekly one-hour radio show on WCCO-AM, a tradition he inherited from his predecessor as governor, Jesse Ventura. Pawlenty was the chairman of the National Governors Association for the 2007–2008 term. He also served as Chair of the Midwestern Governors Association in 2006.

Beginning in 2005, Pawlenty was rumored in the press as a potential candidate for president of the United States. When formally announcing his candidacy for a second term as Governor of Minnesota on May 31, 2006, Pawlenty said, &quot;As to my future, if I run for governor and win, I will serve out my term for four years as governor.&quot; On January 15, 2007, after being reelected, Pawlenty said, &quot;I am committed to serving out my term as governor. That&#x27;s what I am going to do.&quot;

In 2007, it was announced that Pawlenty would be serving in a lead role for McCain as a national co-chair of his presidential exploratory committee which led to Pawlenty&#x27;s becoming co-chairman of McCain&#x27;s campaign (along with Phil Gramm and Tom Loeffler). In January 2008, a reporter for the Minneapolis &quot;Star Tribune&quot; suggested Pawlenty&#x27;s renewed focus on his proposed immigration reform plans might be politically motivated as counterbalance to McCain&#x27;s less favorable guest worker program.

For many weeks, Pawlenty was widely considered to be a leading candidate for the vice-presidential nomination on the Republican ticket with John McCain in the 2008 presidential election. In a surprise, McCain chose Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. In the aftermath of the running mate selection, Pawlenty was regarded as a potential contender for the position of Secretary of Transportation in a possible McCain presidency.

In 2008, Pawlenty expressed support for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). But in 2010, he claimed that he had made those statements solely as a surrogate for presidential nominee McCain and never actually supported the idea himself. On May 23, 2011, Pawlenty formally announced he&#x27;d run for the Republican presidential nomination, saying, &quot;politicians are often afraid that if they&#x27;re too honest, they might lose an election. I&#x27;m afraid that in 2012, if we&#x27;re not honest enough, we may lose our country.&quot;

==2012 presidential campaign==
===Early steps===
In February 2005, ABC News identified him as a potential candidate for president. Pawlenty decided not to seek a third consecutive term as governor, and so was not a candidate in the November 2010 gubernatorial election. In July 2009, Public Policy Polling conducted a poll that showed that President Obama was favored to win against Pawlenty in his home state of Minnesota by more than 10 points. In October 2009, a CNN article suggested that Pawlenty was contemplating a 2012 White House bid. Among those advising him in preparation for a potential presidential run was lobbyist and former Congressman Vin Weber.

In late 2009, Pawlenty began taking steps that many saw as leading to a 2012 presidential bid. He visited Iowa in November 2009 and April 2010, making political speeches. In January 2011, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that &quot;Few Americans, in fact, even know his name.&quot; In January 2011, Pawlenty told the College Republicans group at The George Washington University &quot;If I decide to run it would be for president, not vice president.&quot;

===Book tour and political positions===

Pawlenty went on tour for his book &quot;Courage to Stand&quot;, and as of January 18, his book had reached #1,979 on Amazon.com&#x27;s list of bestsellers. Pawlenty calls himself a social conservative. In his extended interview with Jon Stewart on &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, he said he thinks United States Social Security and Medicare need to be cut to balance the federal budget. Pawlenty believes that state governments should outlaw abortion, except for cases of rape, incest, and to save a woman&#x27;s life. He thinks the United States Supreme Court decided &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; wrongly, abortion being a state, not a federal, matter. He opposes same-sex marriage and civil unions, and said on talk radio &quot;... I have been a public supporter of maintaining Don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell and I would support reinstating it as well&quot;.

In December 2010, Pawlenty was one of three U.S. governors who publicly declared solidarity with the Christian-right group Family Research Council.

Pawlenty&#x27;s tour was in Minneapolis, San Francisco and Dallas, and it ended January in Iowa where the Iowa Caucuses were scheduled for February 6, 2012. &quot;That will come up fast,&quot; he said, &quot;if I do run.&quot; In Minneapolis, speaking to Pat Kessler of WCCO-TV who asked about his feelings regarding a potential run for president by Representative Michele Bachmann, &quot;I have a lot of respect for Michele Bachmann … Whether she runs or not, it&#x27;s gonna be a big field. There&#x27;s gonna be five, six, seven, eight people running … Whoever wants to run can run. The more, the merrier.&quot;

In a December 2010 column in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, Pawlenty argued in favor of the historical benefits of &quot;private sector&quot; labor unions and strongly against &quot;public sector&quot; labor unions, whose collective bargaining rights he would like to see curbed: &quot;The rise of the labor movement in the early 20th century was a triumph for America&#x27;s working class. In an era of deep economic anxiety, unions stood up for hard-working but vulnerable families, protecting them from physical and economic exploitation.&quot; He also criticized modern unions: &quot;The moral case for unions—protecting working families from exploitation—does not apply to public employment... Unionized public employees are making more money, receiving more generous benefits, and enjoying greater job security than the working families forced to pay for it with ever-higher taxes, deficits and debt.&quot;

===Candidacy===
On March 21, 2011, Pawlenty announced via Facebook that he had formed an exploratory committee in preparation for a potential run for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination.

On April 12, 2011, Pawlenty said on CNN&#x27;s &quot;Piers Morgan Tonight&quot; that he was &quot;running for president&quot; and not for vice president, adding that a formal announcement would be given in several weeks. On Twitter, his spokesman said CNN took his comments out of context.

On May 23, 2011, Pawlenty launched his candidacy for president in a speech in Iowa stating: &quot;I&#x27;m going to try something a little unusual in politics. I&#x27;m just going to tell the truth.&quot; A YouTube video appeared a day before. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; wrote of his candidacy, and the luck he experienced in the GOP&#x27;s field, that Pawlenty has a &quot;golden chance to become the chief rival to... Mitt Romney&quot;.

Pawlenty finished third in the Ames Straw Poll on August 13, 2011, behind the winner Michele Bachmann and the runner-up Ron Paul. Before the Ames debate, he took a more aggressive stance against Romney, including the coining the term &quot;Obamneycare&quot;. When pressed by John King during CNN&#x27;s June 13, 2011, debate to address why he used the word, he backed off. However, he denied that he backed off. The following day he announced his decision to withdraw from the presidential race. On September 12, 2011, Pawlenty announced his endorsement of former Governor Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, as well as his position as national co-chair for Romney&#x27;s campaign. Romney retired over $400,000 of Pawlenty&#x27;s campaign debt.

==Financial Services Roundtable==
On September 20, 2012, Pawlenty&#x27;s advisor Brian McClung announced to Associated Press that Pawlenty would resign as the co-chairman of Mitt Romney&#x27;s electoral campaign. He was to head the Financial Services Roundtable (FSR), a financial service industry lobby group in Washington, D.C. He would not be running in the 2014 gubernatorial election in Minnesota nor in the state&#x27;s 2014 senatorial election. He assumed the positions of President &amp; CEO. He replaced Steve Bartlett, a former U.S. Representative from Texas who had held the positions since 1999.

In November 2012, Pawlenty said that &quot;Republicans and Democrats will have to reconcile their differences on spending and taxes because the &#x27;walls of reality are closing in on them&#x27;&quot; relative to the federal government&#x27;s looming &quot;fiscal cliff&quot;. Presenting himself as not from Wall Street or from Washington and, having previously criticized &quot;entrenched financial interests&quot;, he said he could &quot;bring a fresh and new voice to those debates&quot;. He also &quot;refuted assertions that implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act, legislation enacted roughly 27 months [earlier] in response to the financial crisis, ha[d] been delayed because of lobbying&quot;.

===2018 gubernatorial campaign===

In February 2018, Pawlenty began considering running for a third term as governor of Minnesota and started meeting with Republican donors and advisors. He announced his candidacy on April 5. Pawlenty lost the Republican primary to Hennepin County Commissioner Jeff Johnson. His campaign was affected by disparaging statements he made about then presidential candidate Donald Trump. Pawlenty eventually declared his support for Trump before running for governor, but said after his defeat that the &quot;Republican party has shifted&quot; and that he was not a &quot;Trump-like politician&quot; in the &quot;era of Trump&quot;. He said he was ending his career in politics.

==Personal life==

Pawlenty and his wife Mary have two daughters, Anna and Mara. Mary was appointed as a judge of the Dakota County District Court in Hastings, Minnesota, in 1994. After he was elected governor in 2002, the family remained at their Eagan home instead of moving into the Governor&#x27;s residence because his wife was required to live in her judicial district. In 2007, she left her judicial position to become General Counsel of the National Arbitration Forum, a dispute-resolution company based in Minneapolis. She stayed only briefly before departing for another dispute-resolution company, the Gilbert Mediation Center.

Pawlenty was raised a Roman Catholic. His conversion to Evangelical Protestantism has been attributed to Mary, who is a member of Wooddale Church in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, a member congregation of the Minnesota Baptist Conference. In a January 2011 interview, Pawlenty said, &quot;I love and respect and admire the Catholic Church. I still attend Mass once in a while there. The church I now attend is an interdenominational church which has got many former Catholics in it, and so we share the Christian faith and the Bible. I had to reconcile my faith life with my wife so we could have a consistent, integrated family faith life.&quot;

Pawlenty frequently uses (and is called by) the mononym &quot;TPaw&quot; or &quot;T-Paw&quot;.

Pawlenty ran the 2004 Twin Cities Marathon, finishing with a time of 3 hours, 57 minutes, and 52 seconds. He was the first sitting governor to run the race.

===Political views===
Pawlenty is generally considered a conservative on the American political spectrum. With regard to his economic record, he has drawn mixed reviews from fiscally conservative interest groups. The lobbying group Taxpayers League of Minnesota gave Pawlenty an average approval score of 80% during his years as a state legislator, while the Cato Institute think-tank gave him scores ranging from C to A across his eight years as governor. In February 2008, &quot;Washington Post&quot; columnist Robert Novak wrote that Pawlenty was the most conservative Minnesota governor since Governor Theodore Christianson in the 1920s. A 2011 white paper by the Club for Growth, analyzing Pawlenty as a presidential candidate, found his political stance difficult to identify. The group praised him for reduced growth in spending and taxation, but found that he &quot;has some simply inexcusable tax hikes in his record&quot; and questioned his support of proposals such as &quot;mandatory vegetable oil in gasoline, cap and trade, and a statewide smoking ban&quot;. Chris Edwards, a director at Cato, speculated that Pawlenty&#x27;s rightward tack in his second term was related to his impending presidential run. In Pawlenty&#x27;s 2018 Minnesota gubernatorial campaign, he received an A rating from the National Rifle Association of America, supported permit-to-carry laws, and was open to an optional background check for private firearm sales.

Pawlenty voted for President Donald Trump and &quot;support[s] most of what&#x27;s he&#x27;s doing, nearly all of what he&#x27;s doing on a policy level.&quot; In 2016, Pawlenty had expressed disapproval of Trump&#x27;s &quot;comments and language and behavior&quot;, calling the president &quot;unsound, uninformed, unhinged and unfit&quot; during his campaign. Pawlenty stated that since the election, &quot;he&#x27;s made a lot of great progress as leader of our country and president of the United States in terms of policy priorities and the outcomes.&quot;

===Approval ratings===
In April 2009, 46% of Minnesotans approved of Pawlenty, while 40% disapproved. Among registered Republicans nationwide in July 2009, 38% had a favorable view of him while 33% didn&#x27;t, according to a Rasmussen Reports survey. In March 2010, 42% of Minnesotans approved of Pawlenty, while 52% disapproved.

In October 2010, a Rasmussen report showed that Pawlenty had a 49% approval rating among Minnesotans, with 49% disapproving. A March 2011 survey by Gallup stated that Pawlenty began his presidential run with only 41% name recognition in the GOP. Also in March 2011, the Public Policy Polling (PPP) agency found that nationwide voters had a net negative view of Pawlenty, with 15% viewing him favorably versus 33% unfavorably. In a 2011 PPP poll of registered Minnesota voters conducted from May 27–30, 42% of Minnesotans had a favorable opinion of Pawlenty, while 52% had an unfavorable opinion of him. In the presidential race, President Obama lead Pawlenty by 51% to 43%, suggesting Pawlenty could lose his home state to President Obama were he the 2012 GOP nominee.

<text>An arcade is a succession of contiguous arches, with each arch supported by a colonnade of columns or piers. Exterior arcades are designed to provide a sheltered walkway for pedestrians; they include many loggias, but here arches are not an essential element. An arcade may feature arches on both sides of the walkway. Alternatively, a blind arcade superimposes arcading against a solid wall.

Blind arcades are a feature of Romanesque architecture that influenced Gothic architecture. In the Gothic architectural tradition, the arcade can be located in the interior, in the lowest part of the wall of the nave, supporting the triforium and the clerestory in a cathedral, or on the exterior, in which they are usually part of the walkways that surround the courtyard and cloisters.

A different, related meaning is &quot;a covered passage with shops on one or both sides&quot;. Many medieval open arcades housed shops or stalls, either in the arcaded space itself, or set into the main wall behind. From this, &quot;arcade&quot; has become a general word for a group of shops in a single building, regardless of the architectural form.

The word &quot;arcade&quot; comes from French &quot;arcade&quot; from Provençal &quot;arcada&quot; or Italian &quot;arcata&quot;, based on Latin &quot;arcus&quot;, ‘bow’ (see arc and arch).

A related but ambiguous term is , which is either a small arcade or a blind arcade.

==History==
Arcades go back to at least the Ancient Greek architecture of the Hellenistic period, and were much used by the Romans, for example at the base of the Colosseum. Church cloisters very often use arcading. Islamic architecture very often uses arcades in and outside mosques in particular. In Renaissance architecture elegant arcading was often used as a prominent feature of facades, for example in the Ospedale degli Innocenti (commissioned 1419) or the courtyard of the Palazzo Bardi, both by Filippo Brunelleschi in Florence.

==Shopping arcades==


The French architect, Bertrand Lemoine, described the period, 1786 to 1935, as &quot;l’Ère des passages couverts&quot; (the Arcade Era). He was referring to the grand shopping &quot;arcades&quot; that flourished across Europe during that period. A shopping arcade refers to a multiple-vendor space, operating under a covered roof. Typically, the roof was constructed of glass to allow for natural light and to reduce the need for candles or electric lighting. The 18th and 19th century arcades were designed to attract the genteel middle classes. In time, these arcades came to be the place to shop and to be seen. Arcades offered shoppers the promise of an enclosed space away from the chaos that characterised the noisy, dirty streets; a warm, dry space away from the harsh elements, and a safe haven where people could socialise and spend their leisure time. As thousands of glass covered arcades spread across Europe, they became grander and more ornately decorated. By the mid-nineteenth century, they had become prominent centres of fashion and social life. Promenading in these arcades became a popular nineteenth-century pastime for the emerging middle classes.

The inspiration for the grand shopping arcades may have derived from the fashionable open loggias of Florence however medieval vernacular examples known as &#x27;butterwalks&#x27; were traditional jettied colonnades in British and North European marketplaces; examples remain for example in Totnes and Dartmouth in Devon. During the 16th-century, a pattern of market trading using mobile stalls under covered arcades was established in Florence, from where it spread throughout Italy. Examples of the earliest open loggias include: Mercato Nuovo (1547) by Giovanni Battista del Tasso (and funded by the Medici family); Mercato Vecchio, Florence by Giorgio Vasari (1567) and Loggia del Grano (1619) by Giulio Parigi.

Arcades soon spread across Europe, North America and the antipodes. Examples of these grand shopping arcades include: Palais Royal in Paris (opened in 1784); Passage de Feydeau in Paris (opened in 1791); London&#x27;s Piccadilly Arcade (1810) and Milan&#x27;s Galleria Vittorio Emanuele (1878). Some examples of arcades in North America include New York&#x27;s Paddock Arcade (1850), Ohio&#x27;s Dayton Arcade (1904), and Rhode Island&#x27;s Westminster Arcade (1828). Other notable nineteenth century grand arcades include the Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert in Brussels which was inaugurated in 1847 and Istanbul&#x27;s Çiçek Pasajı opened in 1870. Shopping arcades were the precursor to the modern shopping mall, and the word &quot;arcade&quot; is now often used for malls which do not use the architectural form at all.

The Palais-Royal, which opened in 1784 and became one of the most important marketplaces in Paris, is generally regarded as the earliest example of the grand shopping arcades. Originally, a royal palace, the complex consisted of gardens, shops and entertainment venues situated under the original colonnades. The area boasted some 145 boutiques, cafés, salons, hair salons, bookshops, museums, and numerous refreshment kiosks as well as two theatres. The retail outlets specialised in luxury goods such as fine jewellery, furs, paintings and furniture designed to appeal to the wealthy elite. Retailers operating out of the Palais complex were among the first in Europe to abandon the system of bartering, and adopt fixed-prices thereby sparing their clientele the hassle of bartering. Stores were fitted with long glass exterior windows which allowed the emerging middle-classes to window shop and indulge in fantasies, even when they may not have been able to afford the high retail prices. Thus, the Palais-Royal became one of the first examples of a new style of shopping arcade, frequented by both the aristocracy and the middle classes. It developed a reputation as being a site of sophisticated conversation, revolving around the salons, cafés, and bookshops, but also became a place frequented by off-duty soldiers and was a favourite haunt of prostitutes, many of whom rented apartments in the building.

One of the earliest British examples of a shopping arcade, the Covered Market, Oxford, England was officially opened on 1 November 1774 and is still active today. The Covered Market was started in response to a general wish to clear &quot;untidy, messy and unsavoury stalls&quot; from the main streets of central Oxford. John Gwynn, the architect of Magdalen Bridge, drew up the plans and designed the High Street front with its four entrances. In 1772, the newly formed Market committee, half of whose members came from the town and half from the university, accepted an estimate of nine hundred and sixteen pounds ten shillings, for the building of twenty butchers&#x27; shops. Twenty more soon followed, and after 1773 meat was allowed to be sold only inside the market. From this nucleus the market grew, with stalls for garden produce, pig meat, dairy products and fish.

Gostiny Dvor in St Petersburg, Russia is another early shopping arcade. Sprawling at the intersection of Nevsky Prospekt and Sadovaya Street for over one kilometer and embracing the area of , the indoor complex of more than 100 shops took twenty-eight years to construct. Building commenced in 1757 to an elaborate design by Bartolomeo Rastrelli, but that subsequently was discarded in favour of a less expensive and more functional Neoclassical design submitted by Jean-Baptiste Vallin de la Mothe (1729–1800).

Throughout the following century, Gostiny Dvor was augmented, resulting in ten indoor streets and as many as 178 shops by the 20th century. During the post-World War II reconstructions, its inner walls were demolished and a huge shopping mall came into being. This massive 18th-century structure got a face-lift recently and entered the 21st century as one of the most fashionable shopping centres in Eastern Europe.

An early French arcade is the Passage du Caire created in 1798 as a tribute to the French campaign in Egypt and Syria. It was appreciated by the public for its protection from the weather, noise and filth of the streets. A year later American architect William Thayer created the Passage des Panoramas with a row of shops passing between two panorama paintings. Shopping arcades increasingly were built in the second Bourbon Restoration. Upper levels of arcades often contained apartments and sometimes brothels.

<text>Albert Harold &quot;Al&quot; Quie ( ; September 18, 1923 – August 18, 2023) was an American politician and farmer. Quie served as a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1958 to 1979 and as Governor of Minnesota from 1979 to 1983.

Regarded as a moderate Republican, Quie was considered by Ronald Reagan for his choice of a running mate for the office of Vice President of the United States during the 1980 presidential election. He was also on Gerald Ford&#x27;s list for possible vice presidents following the resignation of Richard Nixon in 1974.

==Early life==
The third of four children, Quie was born on September 18, 1923, on his family&#x27;s farm in Wheeling Township near Dennison, Minnesota, in Rice County. Three of his grandparents were Norwegian immigrants. The farm on which he was born and grew up on had been purchased by his grandfather upon returning to Minnesota from fighting in the Civil War. A third-generation farmer, Quie grew up on the farm learning to ride horses and milk cows.

Quie graduated from Northfield High School in Northfield, Minnesota, in 1942. He served in the United States Navy during World War II as a fighter pilot, finishing flight school just as the war ended. Quie never saw active combat. Following his military service, he graduated from St. Olaf College in 1950, with a degree in political science. It was during this time that he met his future wife Gretchen Hansen.

==State and national government service==
Like his great-grandfather, grandfather, and father before him, Quie became a dairy farmer. A Republican, Quie ran a campaign as a write-in candidate to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 1952, but lost. He served in the Minnesota State Senate from 1955 to 1958, representing the old 18th District.

=== Congress ===

U.S. Representative August Andresen died in January 1958 and Quie ran in the special election to succeed him as the representative for . Quie won the Republican nomination at a party convention and then defeated Democratic-Farmer-Labor nominee Eugene Foley by 655 votes in the February special election. He defeated Foley in the November 1958 general election to win a full term. Quie was a member of the 85th, 86th, 87th, 88th, 89th, 90th, 91st, 92nd, 93rd, 94th, and 95th Congresses. He served on the House Agriculture Committee and the House Education and Labor Committee.

Quie voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1960, 1964, and 1968, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

Quie was briefly considered for Vice President of the United States in 1974 after Gerald Ford became president upon the resignation of Richard Nixon. The position was eventually taken by Nelson Rockefeller.

=== Governor ===
 Quie ran for governor of Minnesota in 1978 against incumbent Rudy Perpich, Quie won the election by 111,775 votes. During his term, he grappled with a budget crisis. Cash-flow problems soon overtook the state government. The old surplus turned into a deficit, estimated at between $600 million and $700 million. A strike by state employees that year symbolized Minnesota’s newfound economic woes. The state had not previously run a deficit since World War II.

Minnesota’s fiscal troubles gave Jim Florio, a Democratic politician running for governor in New Jersey, ammunition for attacking supply-side economics, the theory, then growing in popularity among Republicans, which holds that cutting taxes, spending and regulations fosters economic growth.

After having promised not to raise taxes, Quie was finally forced to do so, “causing much of his political support to evaporate,” . He did not run for re-election in 1982..

In November 1979, 5 foreign students were arrested for allegedly plotting to kidnap Quie, they were later released due to a lack of evidence.

== Later years ==
After leaving politics, Quie became involved with a nonprofit prison ministry. He sold the family farm and traveled extensively, including horseback riding excursions.

==Personal life and death==
Quie&#x27;s grandfather joined the newly founded Republican Party and supported Abraham Lincoln for president in the 1860 United States presidential election.

Quie was a devout Lutheran. He married artist Gretchen Quie, whom he met at St. Olaf, on June 5, 1948. She died of Parkinson&#x27;s disease on December 13, 2015, at age 88.

Quie lived in a senior living community in Wayzata, Minnesota for the last 10 years of his life. Although his health had been declining for months into 2023, he was reportedly healthy in his last few days. He died from natural causes on August 18, 2023 in Wayzata at the age of 99, a month before his 100th birthday.

At the time of his death, he was both the oldest living former American governor and the oldest living former U.S. representative. Quie lay in state in the Rotunda of the Minnesota State Capitol on Saturday, September 9.

<text>The American white ibis (Eudocimus albus) is a species of bird in the ibis family, Threskiornithidae. It is found from the southern half of the US East Coast (from southern New Jersey, Virginia, the Carolinas and Georgia), along the Gulf Coast states (Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas) and south through most of the Caribbean coastal regions of Central America. This particular ibis species is a medium-sized wading bird, possessing an overall white plumage with black wing-tips (usually only visible in flight), and having the typical downward-curving bill of the ibises, though of a bright red-orange color, the same hue as its long legs. Males are larger and have longer bills than females. The breeding range runs along the Gulf and Atlantic Coast, and the coasts of Mexico and Central America. Outside the breeding period, the range extends further inland in North America and also includes the Caribbean. It is also found along the northwestern South American coastline in Colombia and Venezuela. Populations in central Venezuela overlap and interbreed with the scarlet ibis. The two have been classified by some authorities as a single species.

Their diet consists primarily of small aquatic prey, such as insects and small fishes. Crayfish are its preferred food in most regions, but it can adjust its diet according to the habitat and prey abundance. Its main foraging behavior is probing with its beak at the bottom of shallow water to feel for and capture its prey. It does not see the prey.

During the breeding season, the American white ibis gathers in huge colonies near water. Pairs are predominantly monogamous and both parents care for the young, although males tend to engage in extra-pair copulation with other females to increase their reproductive success. Males have also been found to pirate food from unmated females and juveniles during the breeding season.

Human pollution has affected the behavior of the American white ibis via an increase in the concentrations of methylmercury, which is released into the environment from untreated waste. Exposure to methylmercury alters the hormone levels of American white ibis, affecting their mating and nesting behavior and leading to lower reproduction rates.

==Taxonomy==
The American white ibis was one of the many bird species originally described by Carl Linnaeus in the 1758 10th edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, where it was given the binomial name of &quot;Scolopax albus&quot;. The species name is the Latin adjective &quot;white&quot;. Alternative common names that have been used include Spanish curlew and white curlew. English naturalist Mark Catesby mistook immature birds for a separate species, which he called the brown curlew. Local creole names in Louisiana include &quot;bec croche&quot; and &quot;petit flaman&quot;.

Johann Georg Wagler gave the species its current binomial name in 1832 when he erected the new genus &quot;Eudocimus&quot;, whose only other species is the scarlet ibis (&quot;E. ruber&quot;). There has long been debate on whether the two should be considered subspecies or closely related species, and the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union considers the two to be a superspecies as they are parapatric. The lack of observed hybrids was a large factor in the view that the species were separate.

However, in a field study published in 1987, researchers Cristina Ramo and Benjamin Busto found evidence of interbreeding in a population where the ranges of the scarlet and white ibises overlap along the coast and in the Llanos region of Colombia and Venezuela. They observed individuals of the two species mating and pairing, as well as hybrid ibises with pale orange plumage, or white plumage with occasional orange feathers; their proposal that these birds be classified as a single species, has been followed by least one field guide. Hybrid ibises have also been recorded in Florida, where the scarlet ibis has been introduced into wild populations of American white ibis. Birds of intermediate to red plumage have persisted for generations.

Ornithologists James Hancock and Jim Kushlan also consider the two to be a single species, with the differences in plumage, size, skin coloration and degree of bill darkening during breeding season forming the diagnostic characters. They have proposed the populations recontacted in northwestern South America after a period of separation, and that the color difference is likely due to the presence of an enzyme that allows uptake of pigment in the diet. They have questioned whether white-plumaged birds of South America are in fact part of the &quot;ruber&quot; rather than the &quot;albus&quot; taxon, and acknowledge that more investigation is needed to determine this.

==Description==
The white plumage and pink facial skin of adult American white ibises are distinctive. Adults have black wingtips that are usually only visible in flight. In non-breeding condition the long downcurved bill and long legs are bright red-orange. During the first ten days of the breeding season, the skin darkens to a deep pink on the bill and an almost purple-tinted red on the legs. It then fades to a paler pink, and the tip of the bill becomes blackish. It is difficult to determine the sex of an adult American white ibis from its external appearance, since the sexes have similar plumage. However, there is sexual dimorphism in size and proportion as males are significantly larger and heavier than females and have longer and stouter bills. This species is moderately large for an ibis but is relatively short legged, compact and bulky for a large wader. A study of the American white ibis in southern Florida yielded weight ranges of for males and for females, with average weights of for males and for females. The length of adult female and male birds ranges from with a wingspan. Among standard measurements, American white ibis measure along each wing, have a tail measurement of , a tarsus of and a culmen of .

The newly hatched American white ibis is covered with violet down feathers, deepening to dark brown or black on the head and wings. The chest is often bare and there can be a white tuft on the head. The irises are brown. The exposed skin is pinkish initially, apart from the tip of the bill which is dark gray, but turns gray within a few days of hatching. The bill is short and straight at birth and has an egg tooth which falls off between days five and nine, and develops three black rings from around day six, before turning gray by around six weeks of age. The gray to sandy gray brown juvenile plumage appears between weeks two and six, and face and bill become pink a few weeks later, while the legs remain gray. The irises have turned slate-gray by this stage. Once fledged, the juvenile American white ibis has largely brown plumage and only the rump, underwing and underparts are white. The legs become light orange. As it matures, white feathers begin appearing on the back and it undergoes a gradual molt to obtain the white adult plumage. This is mostly complete by the end of the second year, although some brown feathers persist on the head and neck until the end of the third year. Juvenile birds take around two years to reach adult size and weight.

Like other species of ibis, the American white ibis flies with neck and legs outstretched, often in long loose lines or V formations—a 1986 field study in North Carolina noted over 80% of adult ibis doing so, while juveniles rapidly took up the practice over the course of the summer. The resulting improvement in aerodynamics may lower energy expenditure. These lines fly in an undulating pattern as they alternately flap and glide. Soaring in a circular pattern is also seen. Heights of may be reached as birds glide over flights of or more. More commonly, birds fly between above the ground, gliding or flapping at a rate of around 3.3 wingbeats a second.

The main call of the American white ibis is a honking sound, transcribed as &quot;urnk, urnk&quot;, or &quot;hunk, hunk&quot;. The call is used in flight, courtship or when disturbed. Birds also utter a muted &quot;huu-huu-huu&quot; call while foraging, and make a squealing call in courtship. Young in the nest give a high-pitched &quot;zziu&quot; as a begging call.

===Similar species===
Immature American white and scarlet ibises are very difficult to tell apart, although scarlet ibises tend to have darker legs and bare skin around the face. An immature American white ibis could be mistaken for an immature glossy ibis, but the latter is wholly dark brown and lacks the white belly and rump. The adult is distinguishable from the wood stork, which is much larger and its wings have more black on them.

==Distribution and habitat==
The American white ibis is most common in Florida, where over 30,000 have been counted in a single breeding colony. It also occurs throughout the Caribbean, on both coasts of Mexico (from Baja California southwards) and Central America, and as far south as Colombia and Venezuela. The non-breeding range extends further inland, reaching north to Virginia, and west to eastern Texas. The species is known to wander, and has been sighted, sometimes in small flocks, in states far out of its usual range.

In North America, breeding takes place along the Atlantic coast, from the southern New Jersey south to Florida and thence west along the Gulf Coast. Laguna Cuyutlán is an isolated and regionally important wetland in the state of Colima on México&#x27;s west coast where a breeding colony has been recorded. American white ibises are not faithful to the sites where they breed, and large breeding colonies composed of ten thousand birds or more can congregate and disband in one or two breeding seasons. Breeding populations across its range have fluctuated greatly with wholesale movement between states.

Until the 1940s, the species bred only in large numbers in Florida, mostly within the Everglades. Drought conditions elsewhere in the United States led to more than 400,000 American white ibis breeding there in the 1930s. In the 1950s and 1960s, large colonies appeared in Alabama, Louisiana, and then North and South Carolina and the Gulf Coast of Florida, and finally Texas in the 1970s. Between the 1970s and early 1990s, breeding colonies declined and disappeared in South Carolina and Florida, and greatly increased in North Carolina and Louisiana. Colonies last between one and seventeen years, their longevity related to size and quality of nearby wetlands. The longest-lasting are associated with wetlands over in size. Degradation of wetland or breeding sites are reasons for abandonment. The population of American white ibises in a colony at Pumpkinseed Island in Georgetown County, South Carolina, dropped from 10,000 to zero between 1989 and 1990 as Hurricane Hugo had inundated nearby freshwater foraging areas with salt water.

The American white ibis is found in a variety of habitats, although shallow coastal marshes, wetlands and mangrove swamps are preferred. It is also commonly found in muddy pools, on mudflats and even wet lawns. Populations that are away from the coast and shoreline, particularly in southern Florida, often reside in other forms of wetlands such as marshes, ponds and flooded fields. In summer, these move to more coastal and estuarine habitats as inland waterways become flooded with summer rains and the ibis find the water levels too deep to forage effectively.

===Fossil record===
Remains similar to the American white ibis have been found in Middle Pliocene deposits of the Bone Valley formation in central Florida, and Lower Pliocene deposits of the Yorktown Formation at Lee Creek in North Carolina. Two species, one living and one extinct, have been recovered from the Talara Tar Seeps in northern coastal Peru. &quot;Eudocimus peruvianus&quot; was described from a tarsometatarsus that differed slightly from &quot;E. albus&quot;, whose remains were also found there. Remains of neither species are common in the beds. The tar seeps have been dated at 13,900 years old. The American white ibis is still found in Peru.

==Behavior==
A field study late in the Florida nesting season revealed that on an average day, adult American white ibis spent 10.25 hours looking for food, 0.75 hours flying, 13 hours resting, roosting, and attending to their nests. Much of the time roosting is spent preening, biting and working their feathers with their long bills, as well as rubbing the oil glands on the sides of their heads on back plumage. American white ibis generally only preen themselves, not engaging in allopreening unless part of courtship behavior. Bathing often takes place before preening; ibis squat in water deep and flick water over themselves with each wing in succession. Hundreds of birds may bathe together around the time of courtship.

The American white ibis is territorial, defending the nesting and display sites against intruders. Agonistic or threat displays include lunging forward with the bill in a horizontal posture, and standing upright and snapping the bill opposite another bird engaging in the same display. Birds also lunge and bite, often holding onto an opponent&#x27;s head or wings.

===Breeding and lifespan===

The American white ibis pairs up in spring and breeds in huge colonies, often with other waterbird species. Nesting begins as soon as suitable foraging and nesting habitat is available. The female selects the site, usually in the branches of a tree or shrub, which is often over water, and builds the nest, and males assist by bringing nest material. Anywhere from one to five eggs are typically laid, with two or three being the most common. The eggs are matte pale blue-green in color with brown splotches, measure , and weigh on average . Clutch sizes are usually lower in coastal colonies as compared to inland colonies, although there are no statistically significant differences in the fledging rate of both colonies. Throughout the mating and incubation period, the male undergoes a period of starvation to stay close to the nest and aggressively defend his nest and mate from both predators and other ibises in preference to foraging for food. In the 2006 breeding season, a non-breeding adult female was observed to be tending to multiple nests that belonged to other American white ibises—the first time the behavior has been documented for this species.

Although the American white ibis is predominantly monogamous and both sexes provide parental care to their young, the male often flies off to engage in extra-pair copulation with other nesting females after mating with its primary female partner. These extra-pair copulations are usually done after the within-pair copulations, and make up about 45% of all total matings, although only about 15% of all extra-pair copulations are successful. By not restricting the number of females it copulates with, the male is able to increase its reproductive success considerably. Although females are receptive towards extra-pair copulations, male mate-guarding greatly reduces the rate of successful female involvement in attempted extra-pair copulations by other males.
The breeding success of the American white ibis is sensitive to the hydrological conditions of the ecosystem such as rainfall and water levels. Low and decreasing water levels predict good prey accessibility. Water level reversals, where levels rise in the breeding season, disperse prey and impact on foraging success. Nest numbers and average clutch sizes are smaller in periods of reduced prey availability. The success rate of parents raising one or more young to 20 days of age ranges widely from 5 to 70% of nests, and varies greatly between nearby colonies. American white ibis parents have been known to supplement their chicks&#x27; diet with items such as cockroaches and rotting food from human garbage in poorer years, when fish and crayfish are more scarce. Studies have also shown that years with higher nesting numbers had significantly faster spring drying rates of water bodies than years with low nesting numbers. This is because faster drying rates means that there are fewer fish and increased available area where crayfish can be hunted. This highlights the fact that American white ibises do not use probability of nesting failure as a key factor in determining nesting sites but instead, rely on other criteria such as prey availability and nest-site predation rates. The draining of wetlands in south Florida has also impacted on species that forage in shallow water such as the American white ibis, and its increase in numbers is a key indicator of restoration of habitat within the Everglades.

The main cause of nest failure among the species is due to nest abandonment, the leading cause of which is inundation from extremely high tides. Parents abandoned 61% of all nesting starts either during or immediately after extremely high tides. The eggs float out of the flooded nests, or get washed out into the sea by wave action. Incubating parents usually abandon the nest when the water or tidal levels reaches above the bottom of the nest cup. Nevertheless, there have been instances where the parents have been observed to transport their eggs to another nest in an attempt to salvage some eggs. However, despite the fact that some nesting sites face high chance of tidal damage every breeding season, American white ibises still continue to nest in these areas because of other favorable conditions such as abundant nearby food sources and low egg predation rates.
The eggs hatch after about three weeks and the young are attended by both parents. Males are present around the nest for most of the day, and females most of the night. The parents exchange nest duties in the morning and in the evening. Most of the feeding of the chicks occurs during the period where they swap nesting duties. Little feeding is done in the period of the day that is between the two duty swaps and no feeding is done between midnight and 6 a.m. Chick mortality is highest in the first twenty days post hatching, with anywhere from 37 to 83% of hatchlings surviving to three weeks of age in the Everglades. During periods of food limitations and starvation events, the American white ibis tends to exhibit sex-dependent pre-fledgling mortality. For many bird species that have sexually dimorphic nestlings, mortality rates are higher for larger-sized male nestlings as a result of the parents&#x27; inability to meet its greater nutritional needs. However, in the case of the American white ibis, the male nestlings actually have a lower mortality rate as compared to the females despite being on average 15% greater in mass as compared to its female counterparts. Although current research has yet to discover the underlying factors to why the males tend to have better survival rates under such conditions, it is suspected that the parents tend to feed the larger male nestlings first because they are either perceived by the parents to have a higher chance of survival, or, being generally larger, the male nestlings simply out-compete the small females for food.

Bird predators may seize anywhere from 7% to 75% of the progeny in a breeding colony. The fish crow (&quot;Corvus ossifragus&quot;) is common raider of American white ibis nests, accounting for up to 44% of egg loss in a field study at Battery Island, North Carolina. Other predators of eggs and young include the boat-tailed grackle (&quot;Quiscalus major&quot;), black-crowned night heron (&quot;Nycticorax nycticorax&quot;), gulls, and possibly vultures, as well as the common opossum (&quot;Didelphis marsupialis&quot;), raccoon (&quot;Procyon lotor&quot;), and rat snakes (&quot;Elaphe&quot; species). Egg predation rates of the American white ibis decline with nest age owing to increased nest attentiveness by the parents, especially during the last week of incubation. High nest densities and reduced synchrony increase egg predation rates because of the increased opportunities afforded by the longer incubation times, as well as the greater availability of nests available for predation.

The American white ibis begins breeding in its third summer, although birds in captivity may breed as young as nine or ten months of age. The oldest member of the species recorded in captivity was over 20 years of age, and a wild bird has been picked up 16 years and 4 months after being banded.

===Diet===

The American white ibis prefers to eat crayfish and other crustaceans, but also takes aquatic insects and small fish. Outside the nesting season, the diet is highly variable, as abundance and types of prey depend on both the region and the habitat. In the Llanos, located in Colombia and Venezuela, the most frequent prey are insects, such as fly larvae and beetles. Generally in North America the main prey are crustaceans, mostly crayfish. In the Everglades and cypress swamps, the diet is primarily made up of crayfish, while those that feed in willow ponds eat predominantly fish. American white ibises that feed in mangrove swamps focus on crabs. The tactile nature of the ibis&#x27;s probing for food in mud means that it catches prey that are too slow to evade the ibis once located by its bill. In the Everglades, this means that crayfish make up a large part of the diet, but a more diverse array of invertebrates are taken in coastal areas. Although crayfish are sought by foraging ibises, prey switching to fish does occur if fish are found in great abundance. It is unclear whether the fish are more easily caught if overcrowded, or whether sheer numbers of fish mean that ibises are catching them instead of crayfish—normally, fish are more agile than crayfish and hence elude the ibis&#x27;s bill more easily. Fish are a more energy-rich source of food for the American white ibis. In the breeding season, American white ibises in a colony at Pumpkinseed Island travelled further to forage in freshwater wetlands and catch crayfish, than nearby saltwater areas where fiddler crabs predominated, indicating their benefit was worth the extra energy expended in fetching them for their young. This travel results in the wholesale transport of nutrients across the landscape by the colony; in a successful breeding year the colony at Pumpkinseed Island was estimated to have contributed a third as much phosphorus to the neighboring estuary as other environmental processes.

The American white ibis is found in mixed-species foraging flocks with the glossy ibis (&quot;Plegadis falcinellus&quot;) in flooded fields, and the two species select different food items with little overlap; the former foraging for crabs and aquatic insects and the latter feeding mainly on grain. The wood stork is also found in the same habitat in Florida, but hunts larger prey and a higher percentage of fish, so there is little overlap. In the Llanos, where American white ibis coexist with the scarlet ibis, their diets differ, the former consuming more bugs, fish and crustaceans, while the latter eat a much higher proportion of beetles. The willet (&quot;Tringa semipalmata&quot;) has been observed trailing American white ibis and catching prey disturbed by them, and even kleptoparasitizing (stealing) from them, in J. N. &quot;Ding&quot; Darling National Wildlife Refuge on Sanibel Island in Florida. An isolated event of predation in juvenile American white ibis has been observed, where a juvenile attacked and consumed a chick from another nest.

===Foraging===
During the summer, the American white ibis roams along the coast of tidal flats and mangrove swamps as the inland marshes are usually flooded. However, as the water level recedes in the fall, populations at the coast shift their foraging area inland, to inland marshes and swamplands. It has become more common in urban landscapes in Florida since the late 1990s, and is one of a number of wetland-dependent bird species which forages in man-made ponds on golf courses in the southwest of the state.

The American white ibis is a tactile, nonvisual forager, which limits its ability to choose from a wide variety of prey. For the most part, the American white ibis forages for food by tactile probing. It wades slowly through shallow water and sticks its long, downcurved bill into the substrate of the water body with its bill held at around agape at the tip, and sweeps its long bill back and forth across the bottom to pick out suitable food items. Birds may also probe when standing still. Groping with a wide open bill is a technique used by ibis in deeper water when alone, as is head swinging, in which the ibis swings its wide open bill widely in open water. Others copy this type of foraging if they see one ibis doing it. On land, the American white ibis locates prey by sight and pecks, and does not have to insert its bill into the substrate. The American white ibis seeks small prey when other birds are around, as it needs time to break up larger food items into smaller pieces to eat, and other predators such as herons and egrets often take the opportunity to rob the ibis of its catch. Along with the scarlet ibis, the species coexists with another five species of ibis in the Llanos in Venezuela. American white ibis males are aggressive to and take prey items from smaller ibises, but the smaller females are more often the victims of this behavior.

Juveniles have lower foraging efficiency compared to adults and in most feeding flocks, the juveniles are usually outnumbered by the adults. They usually tend to stay close to one another and forage for food together at the peripheral region of the group. During the breeding season, adult male ibises have been recorded raiding other parent ibises who are feeding their young in the colony. The raiders force their bill down the throat of the victim—either the parent about to disgorge their food or recently fed young—and extract the ball of food. This behavior allows the otherwise starving adult males to obtain food without having to spend long periods of time away from the nest, and prevent its female mate copulating with another male ibis, which would reduce its own reproductive success. Females and juveniles almost never try to drive off the larger and more aggressive pirating males, but instead try to avoid or move away from them. This pirating behavior is less common between two male ibises as the males will actively fight off the pirate. The explanation of the species&#x27; sexual dimorphism of body size is unclear, because no differences between the sexes in feeding success rates or the foraging behavior have been observed and, as males are larger, they need more food than females.

==Parasites and mortality==
Causes of death of adult ibis are not well known. Alligators could feasibly prey on nesting ibises but there has been little research in the area. A flock of fifty adult American white ibis were killed in a fire in the Everglades. The corpses were found in a dense swathe of cattail (&quot;Typha angustifolia&quot;), which suggested they had taken shelter there. It is unclear why they had not been able to fly away from the fire, but one hypothesis was that they had been foraging for insects disturbed by the fire.

A total of 51 species of parasitic worm have been recovered from the American white ibis, predominantly from the gastrointestinal system and particularly the small intestine. These include Cestoda (tapeworms), Acanthocephala (thorny headed worms), Nematoda (roundworms), Digenea and Spirurida. Several roundworm and spirurid species have been found in the lining of the gizzard. Nematodes are more prevalent in American white ibis from freshwater habitats, and cestodes more frequent in those from saltwater areas. One nematode found in adult birds, &quot;Skrjabinoclavia thapari&quot;, is borne in the fiddler crab as an intermediate host, while the thorny headed worm species &quot;Southwellina dimorpha&quot; is carried in crayfish and infests both adult and juvenile ibis.

Parasitic protozoa of the genus &quot;Sarcocystis&quot; have been recovered from the smooth muscles of adult American white ibis, and another species, &quot;Haemoproteus plataleae&quot;, has been recovered from the blood of adults and nestlings, and can hence be transmitted before the young leave the nest. The larvae of two species of mite of the family Hypoderidae, &quot;Phalacrodectes whartoni&quot; and &quot;Neoattialges eudocimae&quot;, have been recovered from under the skin. Two species of the louse suborder Mallophaga, &quot;Plegadiphilus eudocimus&quot; and &quot;Ardeicola robusta&quot;, also parasitise the bird.

==Status==
The American white ibis is classed as being of least concern on the IUCN Red List. The population consists of 150,000 mature adults, and is stable, although some populations have unknown trends. A partial survey of under 50% of the North American population published in 2007 found an almost six-fold increase in the last four decades. The estimated breeding range is huge, at . Fluctuating breeding populations and high mobility of colonies make estimating the population difficult. Attempted censuses of breeding colonies across Texas, Louisiana, Florida, and the Carolinas yielded a count of 166,000 breeding birds in 2001, and 209,000 in 2004. The conservation status has been listed in two states—it is a &quot;Species of Special Concern&quot; in Florida, and a species of &quot;Moderate Conservation Concern&quot; in Alabama. The preservation of colony sites and freshwater foraging areas is important to maintaining populations; however, the highly mobile nature of breeding colonies makes this challenging.

===Human impact===
John James Audubon reported that the American white ibis was hunted and sold in Louisiana, and mainly eaten by American Indians. It had orange flesh and a strong fishy taste. Elsewhere, the flesh has been described as appealing on account of the crayfish diet, and both members of the genus &quot;Eudocimus&quot; have been hunted, which has been responsible for decline, across their range. Crawfish farmers in Louisiana have also shot them for foraging in crawfish ponds. Overall, the impact of hunting is not thought to be major.

The pollutant methylmercury is a globally distributed neurotoxin and an endocrine system disruptor. In the Everglades ecosystem, human pollution has led to increased concentrations of methylmercury, which have impacted the behaviors of the American white ibis. Hormone levels in males are affected, leading to a decrease in the rates of key courtship behavior, and fewer approaches by females during the mating season. In addition, methylmercury also increased male-male pairing behaviors by 55%. Both the chemically induced &quot;homosexual&quot; behavior and the diminished ability to attract females by males have reduced reproduction rates in affected populations. Exposure of American white ibises to methylmercury causes reduced foraging efficiency and it also makes them more likely to abandon nests owing to the disruptive effect of the pollutant on the bird&#x27;s hormone systems, which in turn affects parental care behavior. Tests on captive birds have not shown a decreased survival of American white ibis exposed to methylmercury.

==In culture==

Native American folklore held that the bird was the last to seek shelter before a hurricane, and the first to emerge afterwards. The bird was thus a symbol for danger and optimism. For this reason, the University of Miami adopted the American white ibis as its official athletics mascot in 1926, and the yearbook was known as &quot;The Ibis&quot; from that year. The mascot was initially known as Ibis before adopting the name Sebastian in 1957. It was named after San Sebastian Hall, a residence hall on campus, which sponsored an Ibis entry in the college&#x27;s homecoming celebration.

<text>Ribozymes (ribonucleic acid enzymes) are RNA molecules that have the ability to catalyze specific biochemical reactions, including RNA splicing in gene expression, similar to the action of protein enzymes. The 1982 discovery of ribozymes demonstrated that RNA can be both genetic material (like DNA) and a biological catalyst (like protein enzymes), and contributed to the RNA world hypothesis, which suggests that RNA may have been important in the evolution of prebiotic self-replicating systems.

The most common activities of natural or &quot;in vitro&quot; evolved ribozymes are the cleavage (or ligation) of RNA and DNA and peptide bond formation. For example, the smallest ribozyme known (GUGGC-3&#x27;) can aminoacylate a GCCU-3&#x27; sequence in the presence of PheAMP. Within the ribosome, ribozymes function as part of the large subunit ribosomal RNA to link amino acids during protein synthesis. They also participate in a variety of RNA processing reactions, including RNA splicing, viral replication, and transfer RNA biosynthesis. Examples of ribozymes include the hammerhead ribozyme, the VS ribozyme, leadzyme, and the hairpin ribozyme.

Researchers who are investigating the origins of life through the RNA world hypothesis have been working on discovering a ribozyme with the capacity to self-replicate, which would require it to have the ability to catalytically synthesize polymers of RNA. This should be able to happen in prebiotically plausible conditions with high rates of copying accuracy to prevent degradation of information but also allowing for the occurrence of occasional errors during the copying process to allow for Darwinian evolution to proceed.

Attempts have been made to develop ribozymes as therapeutic agents, as enzymes which target defined RNA sequences for cleavage, as biosensors, and for applications in functional genomics and gene discovery.

==Discovery==

Before the discovery of ribozymes, enzymes—which were defined [solely] as catalytic proteins—were the only known biological catalysts. In 1967, Carl Woese, Francis Crick, and Leslie Orgel were the first to suggest that RNA could act as a catalyst. This idea was based upon the discovery that RNA can form complex secondary structures. These ribozymes were found in the intron of an RNA transcript, which removed itself from the transcript, as well as in the RNA component of the RNase P complex, which is involved in the maturation of pre-tRNAs. In 1989, Thomas R. Cech and Sidney Altman shared the Nobel Prize in chemistry for their &quot;discovery of catalytic properties of RNA&quot;. The term &quot;ribozyme&quot; was first introduced by Kelly Kruger &quot;et al.&quot; in a paper published in &quot;Cell&quot; in 1982.

It had been a firmly established belief in biology that catalysis was reserved for proteins. However, the idea of RNA catalysis is motivated in part by the old question regarding the origin of life: Which comes first, enzymes that do the work of the cell or nucleic acids that carry the information required to produce the enzymes? The concept of &quot;ribonucleic acids as catalysts&quot; circumvents this problem. RNA, in essence, can be both the chicken and the egg.

In the 1980s, Thomas Cech, at the University of Colorado Boulder, was studying the excision of introns in a ribosomal RNA gene in &quot;Tetrahymena thermophila&quot;. While trying to purify the enzyme responsible for the splicing reaction, he found that the intron could be spliced out in the absence of any added cell extract. As much as they tried, Cech and his colleagues could not identify any protein associated with the splicing reaction. After much work, Cech proposed that the intron sequence portion of the RNA could break and reform phosphodiester bonds. At about the same time, Sidney Altman, a professor at Yale University, was studying the way tRNA molecules are processed in the cell when he and his colleagues isolated an enzyme called RNase-P, which is responsible for conversion of a precursor tRNA into the active tRNA. Much to their surprise, they found that RNase-P contained RNA in addition to protein and that RNA was an essential component of the active enzyme. This was such a foreign idea that they had difficulty publishing their findings. The following year, Altman demonstrated that RNA can act as a catalyst by showing that the RNase-P RNA subunit could catalyze the cleavage of precursor tRNA into active tRNA in the absence of any protein component.

Since Cech&#x27;s and Altman&#x27;s discovery, other investigators have discovered other examples of self-cleaving RNA or catalytic RNA molecules. Many ribozymes have either a hairpin – or hammerhead – shaped active center and a unique secondary structure that allows them to cleave other RNA molecules at specific sequences. It is now possible to make ribozymes that will specifically cleave any RNA molecule. These RNA catalysts may have pharmaceutical applications. For example, a ribozyme has been designed to cleave the RNA of HIV. If such a ribozyme were made by a cell, all incoming virus particles would have their RNA genome cleaved by the ribozyme, which would prevent infection.

==Structure and mechanism==
Despite having only four choices for each monomer unit (nucleotides), compared to 20 amino acid side chains found in proteins, ribozymes have diverse structures and mechanisms. In many cases they are able to mimic the mechanism used by their protein counterparts. For example, in self cleaving ribozyme RNAs, an in-line SN2 reaction is carried out using the 2’ hydroxyl group as a nucleophile attacking the bridging phosphate and causing 5’ oxygen of the N+1 base to act as a leaving group. In comparison, RNase A, a protein that catalyzes the same reaction, uses a coordinating histidine and lysine to act as a base to attack the phosphate backbone.

Like many protein enzymes, metal binding is also critical to the function of many ribozymes. Often these interactions use both the phosphate backbone and the base of the nucleotide, causing drastic conformational changes. There are two mechanism classes for the cleavage of a phosphodiester backbone in the presence of metal. In the first mechanism, the internal 2’- OH group attacks the phosphorus center in a SN2 mechanism. Metal ions promote this reaction by first coordinating the phosphate oxygen and later stabling the oxyanion. The second mechanism also follows a SN2 displacement, but the nucleophile comes from water or exogenous hydroxyl groups rather than RNA itself. The smallest ribozyme is UUU, which can promote the cleavage between G and A of the GAAA tetranucleotide via the first mechanism in the presence of Mn2+. The reason why this trinucleotide (rather than the complementary tetramer) catalyzes this reaction may be because the UUU-AAA pairing is the weakest and most flexible trinucleotide among the 64 conformations, which provides the binding site for Mn2+.

Phosphoryl transfer can also be catalyzed without metal ions. For example, pancreatic ribonuclease A and hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozymes can catalyze the cleavage of RNA backbone through acid-base catalysis without metal ions. Hairpin ribozyme can also catalyze the self-cleavage of RNA without metal ions, but the mechanism for this is still unclear.

Ribozyme can also catalyze the formation of peptide bond between adjacent amino acids by lowering the activation entropy.

==Activities==

Although ribozymes are quite rare in most cells, their roles are sometimes essential to life. For example, the functional part of the ribosome, the biological machine that translates RNA into proteins, is fundamentally a ribozyme, composed of RNA tertiary structural motifs that are often coordinated to metal ions such as Mg2+ as cofactors. In a model system, there is no requirement for divalent cations in a five-nucleotide RNA catalyzing &quot;trans&quot;-phenylalanation of a four-nucleotide substrate with 3 base pairs complementary with the catalyst, where the catalyst/substrate were devised by truncation of the C3 ribozyme.

The best-studied ribozymes are probably those that cut themselves or other RNAs, as in the original discovery by Cech and Altman. However, ribozymes can be designed to catalyze a range of reactions, many of which may occur in life but have not been discovered in cells.

RNA may catalyze folding of the pathological protein conformation of a prion in a manner similar to that of a chaperonin.

== Ribozymes and the origin of life ==
RNA can also act as a hereditary molecule, which encouraged Walter Gilbert to propose that in the distant past, the cell used RNA as both the genetic material and the structural and catalytic molecule rather than dividing these functions between DNA and protein as they are today; this hypothesis is known as the &quot;RNA world hypothesis&quot; of the origin of life. Since nucleotides and RNA (and thus ribozymes) can arise by inorganic chemicals, they are candidates for the first enzymes, and in fact, the first &quot;replicators&quot; (i.e., information-containing macro-molecules that replicate themselves). An example of a self-replicating ribozyme that ligates two substrates to generate an exact copy of itself was described in 2002.
The discovery of the catalytic activity of RNA solved the &quot;chicken and egg&quot; paradox of the origin of life, solving the problem of origin of peptide and nucleic acid central dogma. According to this scenario, at the origin of life, all enzymatic activity and genetic information encoding was done by one molecule: RNA.

Ribozymes have been produced in the laboratory that are capable of catalyzing the synthesis of other RNA molecules from activated monomers under very specific conditions, these molecules being known as RNA polymerase ribozymes. The first RNA polymerase ribozyme was reported in 1996, and was capable of synthesizing RNA polymers up to 6 nucleotides in length. Mutagenesis and selection has been performed on an RNA ligase ribozyme from a large pool of random RNA sequences, resulting in isolation of the improved &quot;Round-18&quot; polymerase ribozyme in 2001 which could catalyze RNA polymers now up to 14 nucleotides in length. Upon application of further selection on the Round-18 ribozyme, the B6.61 ribozyme was generated and was able to add up to 20 nucleotides to a primer template in 24 hours, until it decomposes by cleavage of its phosphodiester bonds.

The rate at which ribozymes can polymerize an RNA sequence multiples substantially when it takes place within a micelle.

The next ribozyme discovered was the &quot;tC19Z&quot; ribozyme, which can add up to 95 nucleotides with a fidelity of 0.0083 mutations/nucleotide. Next, the &quot;tC9Y&quot; ribozyme was discovered by researchers and was further able to synthesize RNA strands up to 206 nucleotides long in the eutectic phase conditions at below-zero temperature, conditions previously shown to promote ribozyme polymerase activity.

The RNA polymerase ribozyme (RPR) called tC9-4M was able to polymerize RNA chains longer than itself (i.e. longer than 177 nt) in magnesium ion concentrations close to physiological levels, whereas earlier RPRs required prebiotically implausible concentrations of up to 200 mM. The only factor required for it to achieve this was the presence of a very simple amino acid polymer called lysine decapeptide.

The most complex RPR synthesized by that point was called 24-3, which was newly capable of polymerizing the sequences of a substantial variety of nucleotide sequences and navigating through complex secondary structures of RNA substrates inaccessible to previous ribozymes. In fact, this experiment was the first to use a ribozyme to synthesize a tRNA molecule. Starting with the 24-3 ribozyme, Tjhung et al. applied another fourteen rounds of selection to obtain an RNA polymerase ribozyme by &quot;in vitro&quot; evolution termed &#x27;38-6&#x27; that has an unprecedented level of activity in copying complex RNA molecules. However, this ribozyme is unable to copy itself and its RNA products have a high mutation rate. In a subsequent study, the researchers began with the 38-6 ribozyme and applied another 14 rounds of selection to generate the &#x27;52-2&#x27; ribozyme, which compared to 38-6, was again many times more active and could begin generating detectable and functional levels of the class I ligase, although it was still limited in its fidelity and functionality in comparison to copying of the same template by proteins such as the T7 RNA polymerase.

An RPR called t5(+1) adds triplet nucleotides at a time instead of just one nucleotide at a time. This heterodimeric RPR can navigate secondary structures inaccessible to 24-3, including hairpins. In the initial pool of RNA variants derived only from a previously synthesized RPR known as the Z RPR, two sequences separately emerged and evolved to be mutualistically dependent on each other. The Type 1 RNA evolved to be catalytically inactive, but complexing with the Type 5 RNA boosted its polymerization ability and enabled intermolecular interactions with the RNA template substrate obviating the need to tether the template directly to the RNA sequence of the RPR, which was a limitation of earlier studies. Not only did t5(+1) not need tethering to the template, but a primer was not needed either as t5(+1) had the ability to polymerize a template in both 3&#x27; → 5&#x27; and 5&#x27; 3 → 3&#x27; directions.

A highly evolved RNA polymerase ribozyme was able to function as a reverse transcriptase, that is, it can synthesize a DNA copy using an RNA template. Such an activity is considered to have been crucial for the transition from RNA to DNA genomes during the early history of life on earth. Reverse transcription capability could have arisen as a secondary function of an early RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ribozyme.

An RNA sequence that folds into a ribozyme is capable of invading duplexed RNA, rearranging into an open holopolymerase complex, and then searching for a specific RNA promoter sequence, and upon recognition rearrange again into a processive form that polymerizes a complementary strand of the sequence. This ribozyme is capable of extending duplexed RNA by up to 107 nucleotides, and does so without needing to tether the sequence being polymerized. 

A short 20-nucleotide RNA variant ribozyme was identified that self-reproduces via template directed ligation of two 10 nucleotide oligomers. This minimal kind of RNA self-reproduction was discovered in a random pool of oligmers, and may represent an early step in the emergence of an RNA based genetic system from primordial components.

==Ribozyme based origin of sexual reproduction==

Sexual reproduction might have been present in the RNA world that preceded DNA cellular life forms. Early cellular life forms having genomes with single copies of essential RNA ribozyme molecules would likely have been vulnerable to environmental damaging conditions that could block replication of an essential ribozyme thus causing cell death. Merger of two such damaged early cells (sexual interaction) would allow undamaged combinations of RNA segments to come together, thus facilitating formation of a functional genome and allowing survival of the cell and ability to reproduce.

==Artificial ribozymes==
Since the discovery of ribozymes that exist in living organisms, there has been interest in the study of new synthetic ribozymes made in the laboratory. For example, artificially produced self-cleaving RNAs with good enzymatic activity have been produced. Tang and Breaker isolated self-cleaving RNAs by &quot;in vitro&quot; selection of RNAs originating from random-sequence RNAs. Some of the synthetic ribozymes that were produced had novel structures, while some were similar to the naturally occurring hammerhead ribozyme.

In 2015, researchers at Northwestern University and the University of Illinois Chicago engineered a tethered ribosome that works nearly as well as the authentic cellular component that produces all the proteins and enzymes within the cell. Called Ribosome-T, or Ribo-T, the artificial ribosome was created by Michael Jewett and Alexander Mankin. The techniques used to create artificial ribozymes involve directed evolution. This approach takes advantage of RNA&#x27;s dual nature as both a catalyst and an informational polymer, making it easy for an investigator to produce vast populations of RNA catalysts using polymerase enzymes. The ribozymes are mutated by reverse transcribing them with reverse transcriptase into various cDNA and amplified with error-prone PCR. The selection parameters in these experiments often differ. One approach for selecting a ligase ribozyme involves using biotin tags, which are covalently linked to the substrate. If a molecule possesses the desired ligase activity, a streptavidin matrix can be used to recover the active molecules.

Lincoln and Joyce used &quot;in vitro&quot; evolution to develop ribozyme ligases capable of self-replication in about an hour, via the joining of pre-synthesized highly complementary oligonucleotides.

Although not true catalysts, the creation of artificial self-cleaving riboswitches, termed &quot;aptazymes&quot;, has also been an active area of research. Riboswitches are regulatory RNA motifs that change their structure in response to a small molecule ligand to regulate translation. While there are many known natural riboswitches that bind a wide array of metabolites and other small organic molecules, only one ribozyme based on a riboswitch has been described: &quot;glmS&quot;. Early work in characterizing self-cleaving riboswitches was focused on using theophylline as the ligand. In these studies, an RNA hairpin is formed which blocks the ribosome binding site, thus inhibiting translation. In the presence of the ligand, in these cases theophylline, the regulatory RNA region is cleaved off, allowing the ribosome to bind and translate the target gene. Much of this RNA engineering work was based on rational design and previously determined RNA structures rather than directed evolution as in the above examples. More recent work has broadened the ligands used in ribozyme riboswitches to include thymine pyrophosphate. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting has also been used to engineering aptazymes.

== Applications ==

Ribozymes have been proposed and developed for the treatment of disease through gene therapy. One major challenge of using RNA-based enzymes as a therapeutic is the short half-life of the catalytic RNA molecules in the body. To combat this, the 2’ position on the ribose is modified to improve RNA stability. One area of ribozyme gene therapy has been the inhibition of RNA-based viruses.

A type of synthetic ribozyme directed against HIV RNA called &quot;gene shears&quot; has been developed and has entered clinical testing for HIV infection.

Similarly, ribozymes have been designed to target the hepatitis C virus RNA, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Adenovirus and influenza A and B virus RNA. The ribozyme is able to cleave the conserved regions of the virus&#x27;s genome, which has been shown to reduce the virus in mammalian cell culture. Despite these efforts by researchers, these projects have remained in the preclinical stage.

<text>Paris, Texas is a 1984 neo-Western drama road film directed by Wim Wenders, co-written by Sam Shepard and L. M. Kit Carson, and produced by Don Guest. It stars Harry Dean Stanton, Nastassja Kinski, Dean Stockwell, Aurore Clément, and Hunter Carson. In the film, disheveled recluse Travis Henderson (Stanton) reunites with his brother Walt (Stockwell) and son Hunter (Carson). Travis and Hunter embark on a trip through the American Southwest to track down Travis&#x27;s missing wife, Jane (Kinski).

The film is a co-production between companies in France and West Germany, but it is English-spoken and was filmed primarily in West Texas, which also serves as its major setting. Cinematography was handled by Robby Müller, while the musical score was composed by Ry Cooder.

At the 1984 Cannes Film Festival, it won the &quot;Palme d&#x27;Or&quot; from the official jury, as well as the FIPRESCI Prize and the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury. It went on to other honors and widespread critical acclaim praising mainly direction, acting, cinematography, emotional resonance and musical score.

==Plot==

Travis Henderson is wandering through the West Texas desert, bewildered and holding an empty gallon water jug. He wanders into a convenience store, opens a freezer, and starts eating ice before losing consciousness. A doctor examines Travis and believes that he is mute. The doctor goes through Travis&#x27;s wallet and finds a card with a phone number on it. He calls the number, which belongs to Walt Henderson, Travis&#x27;s brother.

Walt travels from Los Angeles to Terlingua, Texas, to pick up Travis, whom he had presumed was dead after not hearing from him for four years. Walt&#x27;s wife, Anne, is worried since she and Walt had adopted Travis&#x27;s son, Hunter, as Hunter&#x27;s biological mother, Jane, had been out of his life for years. Walt finds Travis wandering miles down the road from the clinic.

The brothers begin their road trip back to Los Angeles. Walt grows increasingly frustrated with Travis&#x27;s muteness and confronts him about his disappearance and abandonment of Hunter. At the mention of Hunter, Travis begins to cry but still does not speak. The following day, Travis finally begins to speak and produces a photo of a plot of land, explaining that he purchased a property in Paris, Texas.

The brothers arrive in Los Angeles, where Walt and Anne own a house in the Verdugo Hills overlooking the Burbank Airport. There Travis is reunited with Hunter who has little recollection of his father and is initially timid around him. Walt shows Hunter old home videos of them and Jane, and, after persistence by Travis, Hunter grows comfortable around his father. Anne tells Travis in confidence that Jane deposits monthly payments into a bank account for Hunter, and that the bank is in Houston. Anne pays particular attention to Travis, often seeking his attention around the house. Restless, Travis becomes determined to find Jane and tells Hunter that he must leave the following night. Hunter tells Travis that he wants to accompany him, though they do not have Walt and Anne&#x27;s permission.

Travis and Hunter embark on a road trip to Houston, with the two of them bonding and growing closer. They arrive at the bank on the day of the expected deposit and plan to locate Jane&#x27;s car. Hunter spots Jane making a drive-in deposit, and they follow her car to a peep show club where she works. Travis goes inside while Hunter waits in the car. The peep show is designed so that customers sit on one side of a one-way mirror with a telephone intercom to the performer. When Jane enters the room, Travis becomes angry and berates her, then apologizes and leaves.

The following day, Travis leaves Hunter at a hotel and goes to Jane&#x27;s workplace. In Jane&#x27;s room, he turns his chair so it faces away from her. On the phone, he tells her a vague story about a man and a younger woman who met, quickly fell in love with each other, got married, and had a child. Jane is initially confused but soon realizes that it is Travis. He tells her that after the child was born, the wife became irritable and enraged, and yearned for an escape. She would have dreams about running naked down a highway, but just as she was about to finally leave, he would appear and stop her. The now-alcoholic husband, fearing his wife&#x27;s departure, tied a cowbell to her foot so he would be able to hear if she left in the night. On one night, the wife—having stuffed socks in the cowbell to muffle the sound—successfully snuck out, though the husband caught her and dragged her back home. He tied her to a stove with his belt and went to bed. When he woke up, the house was on fire, and the wife and child were gone.

Jane turns the light off on her side and finally sees Travis. She expresses pain and regret over missing Hunter&#x27;s childhood. Travis tells Jane that Hunter is in Houston waiting for her and gives her Hunter&#x27;s room number. Jane and Hunter are reunited while Travis watches from the parking lot. Travis drives away, crying.

==Production==
===Development===

West German director Wim Wenders had travelled to the United States and stated he wished &quot;to tell a story about America&quot;. The film is named for the Texas city of Paris, but not set there in any scene. Paris is where Travis thinks he was conceived and where he owns a vacant lot, seen only in a photograph, in which he intended to build a house and live happily with his family. It is used as a metaphor for that ideal life. Wenders had taken photographs like it while location scouting in the Western United States earlier in his career, photographing locations such as Las Vegas and Corpus Christi, Texas.

Screenwriter Sam Shepard met Wenders to discuss writing and/or acting for Wenders&#x27; project &quot;Hammett&quot;. Shepard said he was uninterested in writing &quot;Hammett&quot;, but they considered loosely adapting Shepard&#x27;s &quot;Motel Chronicles&quot;, and developed a story of brothers, one having lost his memory. Their script grew to 160 pages, as the brother-brother relationship lessened in importance, and numerous endings were considered. Little of the funding for the project originated from Germany.

The film shares similar traits to Wenders&#x27; 1974 film &quot;Alice in the Cities&quot; (&quot;Alice in den Städten&quot;).

===Casting===

Harry Dean Stanton had appeared in 100 films before &quot;Paris, Texas&quot;, with small roles in &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot; and a large part in &quot;Repo Man&quot;, which came out the same year as &quot;Paris, Texas&quot;. He embraced the leading part of Travis, saying &quot;After all these years, I finally got the part I wanted to play&quot;. However, Wenders also said Stanton was unsure of his part, and the age disparity between himself and the younger Nastassja Kinski (he was 34 years older). Wenders stated he had discovered Dean Stockwell as he was prepared to quit acting, finding no desirable roles and considering beginning a career in real estate. Hunter Carson was the son of co-screenwriter L. M. Kit Carson, and agreed to act while accompanied by his mother, Karen Black, who helped him memorize the dialogue.

Kinski wrote a diary for the character Jane to develop her backstory, imagining her emigrating from Europe, and getting more affection from Travis than she had from anyone.

According to Stockwell, his character in early drafts was intended to travel with Hunter, Travis and Anne before Anne turned back to Los Angeles and Walt became lost in the desert, paralleling Travis in the first scene. Stockwell and Aurore Clément&#x27;s parts were later reduced.

===Filming===
Wenders said the film, shot in only four to five weeks, with only a small group working the last weeks, was very short and fast. There was a break in shooting during which time the script was completed. Filmmaker Allison Anders worked as a production assistant on the film, while Claire Denis served as assistant director. Filming largely occurred in Fort Stockton and Marathon in the Trans-Pecos region of West Texas. The film marked Wenders&#x27; first time avoiding storyboarding completely, going straight to rehearsals on location before shooting.

Shooting had already started in 1983 when the screenplay was still incomplete, with the objective of filming in the order of the story. Shepard planned to base the rest of the story on the actors&#x27; observations and their understanding of the characters. However, when Shepard moved on to another job, he sent Wenders notes on how the screenplay should end instead. Shepard credited Wenders and L. M. Kit Carson with the idea of a peep show and the story&#x27;s final acts. At the request of Wenders, Shepard composed Travis&#x27;s climactic monologue to Jane, and dictated it over the phone to a secretary working on the film. The filmmakers opted not to portray a realistic peep show, as they needed a format that allowed for more communication between the characters. Kinski could not see anyone, only a mirror, in the peep show scenes, and said this created a genuine feeling of solitude.

Challenges arose when the film ran short of finances, but Wenders was encouraged when they completed the scene with Kinski, remarking, &quot;it dawned on me that we were going to touch people in a big way. I was a little scared by the idea&quot;.

==Themes and interpretation==

Robert Phillip Kolker and Peter Beickene wrote the film presents the United States as &quot;a fantasyland, a place of striking images, a mise-en-scène of desert and city&quot;. Aside from the landscape, there are references to U.S. culture and film, and similarities to John Ford&#x27;s 1956 film &quot;The Searchers&quot;. Academic Roger Cook argued there is a connection between the character of Travis and his surroundings observable on the ride to California. The character gradually moves from the &quot;desolate&quot; to civilization, and Travis continually tries to break away from this difficult transition. His vehicles of choice possibly also reflect his characterization, as his preferred rental car has a bump, and he switches to a clearly used 1958 Ford Ranchero for his return to Texas.

Thomas Elsaesser observed that many of the journeys in Wenders&#x27; filmography are in search of a woman. In the case of &quot;Paris, Texas&quot;, this is with the aim of &quot;escaping her &#x27;now&#x27; in order to find her as she was &#x27;then. Kolker and Beickene commented on the lack of touch, or even &quot;emotional fulfillment&quot; between Travis and Jane at the end, aside from their faces merging in the glass and their discussions of their emotions.

Marc Silberman examined how personal identity is also a theme in the film, as the name &quot;Paris&quot; is deceptive, conjuring images of France but referring to Texas. This is evident in what Travis refers to as &quot;Daddy&#x27;s joke&quot; about Travis&#x27; mother being from Paris, and his belief that he was conceived there causes him to believe going there will achieve self-realization. Elsaesser believed the ending signified Travis sending Hunter in his stead to reunite with Jane. Elsaesser found this to be an example of a complicated system in which various characters see each other through fantasy, and remake each other as they desire. Travis&#x27; father had seen his mother as a Parisian, and this became &quot;a sickness&quot;.

Cook opined that returning to the sanctuary of the road is Travis&#x27; response to having suffered the worst modern American experience, turning his son over to the boy&#x27;s mother. Stan Jones suggested that the story involves a &quot;European way of seeing&quot;, as Travis evolves from being a perceiver, to being a driving force, then back to being a perceiver, before finally withdrawing. Wenders said that the final scene, where Travis leaves Jane and Hunter behind, marked the beginning of the next chapter in his own filmography: &quot;This scene for me had a liberating effect ... I let him disappear in my own way, and all my previous male characters went with him. They have all taken up residence in a retirement home on the outskirts of Paris, Texas.&quot;

&quot;Paris, Texas&quot; belongs in the road movie genre, while &quot;Guardian&quot; critic Guy Lodge suggested it could also be considered a Western. Stan Jones noted Mark Luprecht had classified &quot;Paris, Texas&quot; as a tragedy and had detected Oedipal themes in its depiction of family.

==Style==
&quot;Paris, Texas&quot; is notable for its images of the Texas landscape and climate. Wenders had emphasized roads in his earlier works, particularly his Road Movie trilogy, to depict &quot;characters&#x27; journeys&quot;, with the setting of Texas removing the cultural boundaries of Europe. The opening gives an aerial perspective of the dry desert. Critic Emanuel Levy noted the shots that follow of &quot;billboards, placards, graffiti, rusty iron carcasses, old railway lines, neon signs, motels&quot;. The film&#x27;s production design was by Kate Altman. Cinematographer Robby Müller had frequently worked with Wenders, and the photography in &quot;Paris, Texas&quot; is characteristic of Müller&#x27;s style, which director Steve McQueen defined as &quot;a visual language to capture what appear to be men falling to their deaths in slow motion&quot;. &quot;Senses of Cinema&quot; critic Lee Hill also compared it to the art of Edward Hopper and Edward Ruscha.

The film is accompanied by a slide-guitar score by Ry Cooder, employing Blind Willie Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground&quot;, which Cooder hailed as &quot;the most transcendent piece in all American music&quot;. &quot;Screen International&quot; editor Nick Roddick wrote the music gives &quot;a quality of yearning to the bleakness of the landscape&quot;. In 2018, Cooder revealed a specific source of inspiration during an interview on BBC Radio 4: &quot;[Wenders] did a very good job at capturing the ambience out there in the desert, just letting the microphones ... get tones and sound from the desert itself, which I discovered was in the key of E♭ ... that&#x27;s the wind, it was nice. So we tuned everything to E♭&quot;.

==Release==

&quot;Paris, Texas&quot; competed at the 1984 Cannes Film Festival, with Wenders claiming that Stanton was so anxious about Cannes that they hired Sean Penn to assist with Stanton&#x27;s preparations for the screening. Roddick remarked on how the film&#x27;s affectionate portrayal of the U.S. was well received by European filmmakers at Cannes at a time of high anti-Americanism, given the presidency of Ronald Reagan.

Conflicts between Wenders&#x27; Road Movies company and distributor Filmverlag over how many copies of &quot;Paris, Texas&quot; should be released in West Germany following Cannes caused it to be initially denied a theatrical release there, so bus tours were launched to transport German viewers to Zürich for showings. Road Movies launched a lawsuit to sever ties with Filmverlag, and the film reached West German theatres eight months later.

It was screened at the Sundance Film Festival in 1985 and again in 2006 as part of the &quot;Sundance Collection&quot; category. It returned to Cannes for the Cannes Classics section of the 2014 Festival, after being restored by Cinepost. The film has been released on DVD and Blu-ray in Region 1 by The Criterion Collection.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
Roger Ebert gave the film four stars, writing &quot;&quot;Paris, Texas&quot; is a movie with the kind of passion and willingness to experiment that was more common fifteen years ago than it is now. It has more links with films like &quot;Five Easy Pieces&quot; and &quot;Easy Rider&quot; and &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot;, than with the slick arcade games that are the box-office winners of the 1980s. It is true, deep, and brilliant&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot;″s Holly Willis praised the cinematography, and credited Wenders for a worthy European portrait of the U.S. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; explained, &quot;The film is wonderful and funny and full of real emotion as it details the means by which Travis and the boy become reconciled. Then it goes flying out the car window when father and son decide to take off for Texas in search of Jane&quot;. David Denby criticized &quot;Paris, Texas&quot; in &quot;New York&quot;, calling it &quot;lifeless&quot; and a &quot;fiasco&quot;. &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; boasted Paris, Texas was &quot;The hottest Texas town in France&quot;, noting &quot;Le Monde&quot; placed a rave review of the film on its first page.

It has had an enduring legacy among critics and film aficionados as a cult classic. In 2015, Guy Lodge of &quot;The Guardian&quot; named it a favorite &quot;Palme d&#x27;Or&quot;-winner, while &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; included it in its Best Texas Movies list for its depiction of Marathon, Texas. During the same year, &quot;Paris, Texas&quot; appeared on a posthumous list of Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s 100 favorite movies. In 2016, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; also included it in The 25 Best Texas Movies, while &quot;The Texas Observer&quot; critic Michael Agresta credited it with creating &quot;a certain flavor of Texas cool&quot;. However, that year &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; argued its prestige had lessened somewhat, naming it the 44th best &quot;Palme d&#x27;Or&quot;-winner to date.

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Paris, Texas&quot; holds an approval rating of 95% based on 58 reviews, with an average rating of 8.3/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;A quiet yet deeply moving kind of Western, &quot;Paris, Texas&quot; captures a place and people like never before (or after).&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 81 out of 100, based on 13 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

===Accolades===
At Cannes, the film won three prizes: the &quot;Palme d&#x27;Or&quot;, the FIPRESCI Prize, and the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury. The decision from the main jury on the &quot;Palme d&#x27;Or&quot; was unanimous, with one of the members being French cinematographer Henri Alekan, who would later work with Wenders on &quot;Wings of Desire&quot;.

==Legacy==
The Irish rock group U2 cited &quot;Paris, Texas&quot; as an inspiration for their album &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;. Scottish rock bands Travis and Texas both took their names from the film. The hip hop duo Paris Texas also took their name from the film. The name of the 2024 album &quot;paris paris&quot;, &quot;texas texas&quot; by More Eaze, Glass, and pardo serves as a reference to the film as well. Musicians Kurt Cobain and Elliott Smith have said this was their favorite film of all time.

The film has also influenced later directors, including David Robert Mitchell, who made &quot;It Follows&quot; (2014), saying the aesthetics in its framing and composition were instructive. Wes Anderson was also inspired by Wenders&#x27; home movie scene with the photographs of the dead wife in &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot; (2001). Sam Mendes, director of &quot;American Beauty&quot; (1999), &quot;Skyfall&quot; (2012), and &quot;1917&quot; (2019), also cited it as a major inspiration for his films, describing it as one of his &quot;seminal film moments&quot;.

In 1986, the photography Wenders took on his location scout for &quot;Paris, Texas&quot; was exhibited at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, France, under the title &quot;Written in the West&quot;. In 2000, these were published in a book also titled &quot;Written in the West&quot;, with additional material in &quot;Written in the West, Revisited&quot; in 2015.

<text>The scarlet ibis, sometimes called red ibis (Eudocimus ruber), is a species of ibis in the bird family Threskiornithidae. It inhabits tropical South America and part of the Caribbean. In form, it resembles most of the other twenty-seven extant species of ibis, but its remarkably brilliant scarlet coloration makes it unmistakable. It is one of the two national birds of Trinidad and Tobago, and its Tupi–Guarani name, guará, is part of the name of several municipalities along the coast of Brazil.

This medium-sized wader is a hardy, numerous, and prolific bird, and it has protected status around the world. Its IUCN status is Least Concern. The legitimacy of &quot;Eudocimus ruber&quot; as a biological classification, however, is in dispute. Traditional Linnaean taxonomy classifies it as a unique species, but some scientists have moved to reclassify it as a subspecies of a more general American ibis species, along with its close relative, the American white ibis (&quot;Eudocimus albus&quot;).

==Taxonomy==
The species was first classified by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. Initially given the binomial nomenclature of &quot;Scolopax rubra&quot; (the name incorporates the Latin adjective &quot;ruber&quot;, &quot;red&quot;), the species was later designated &quot;Guara rubra&quot; and ultimately &quot;Eudocimus ruber&quot;.

Biologically the scarlet ibis is very closely related to the American white ibis (&quot;Eudocimus albus&quot;) and is sometimes considered conspecific with it, leaving modern science divided over their taxonomy. The two birds each have exactly the same bones, claws, beaks, feather arrangements and other features – their one marked difference lies in their pigmentation. Traditional taxonomy has regarded the two as separate and distinct.

Early ornithological field research revealed no natural crossbreeding among the red and white, lending support to the two-species viewpoint. More recent observation, however, has documented significant crossbreeding and hybridization in the wild. Researchers Cristina Ramo and Benjamin Busto found evidence of interbreeding in a population where the ranges of the scarlet and white ibises overlap along the coast and in the Llanos in Colombia and Venezuela. They observed individuals of the two species mating and pairing, as well as hybrid ibises with pale orange plumage, or white plumage with occasional orange feathers, and have proposed that these birds be classified as a single species. Hybridization has been known to occur frequently in captivity. However, the two color forms persist in the wild despite overlapping ranges and hybrid offspring having a distinctive color type, so according to the cohesion species concept they would be functionally different species.

Some biologists now wish to pair them with &quot;Eudocimus albus&quot; as two subspecies of the same American ibis. Others simply define both of them as one and the same species, with &quot;ruber&quot; being a color variation of &quot;albus&quot;.

==Description==

Adult plumage is virtually all scarlet. The feathers may show various tints and shades, but only the tips of their wings deviate from their namesake color. A small but reliable marking, these wingtips are a rich inky black (or occasionally dark blue) and are found only on the longest primaries – otherwise the birds&#x27; coloration is &quot;a vivid orange-red, almost luminous in quality.&quot; Scarlet ibises have red bills and feet however the bill is sometimes blackish, especially toward the end. They have a long, narrow, decurved bill. Their legs and neck are long and extended in flight.

A juvenile scarlet ibis is a mix of grey, brown, and white. As it grows, a heavy diet of red crustaceans produces the scarlet coloration. The color change begins with the juvenile&#x27;s second moult, around the time it begins to fly: the change starts on the back and spreads gradually across the body while increasing in intensity over a period of about two years. The scarlet ibis is the only shorebird with red coloration in the world.

Adults are long, and the males, slightly larger than females, typically weigh about . Their bills are also on average around 22% longer than those of females. The life span of the scarlet ibis is approximately sixteen years in the wild and twenty years in captivity. An adult scarlet ibis has a wingspan of around . Though it spends most of its time on foot or wading through water, the bird is a very strong flyer: they are highly migratory and easily capable of long-distance flight. They move as flocks in a classic V formation.

==Distribution and habitat==

The range of the scarlet ibis is very large, and colonies are found throughout vast areas of South America and the Caribbean islands. Native flocks exist in Brazil; Colombia; French Guiana; Guyana; Suriname; and Venezuela, as well as the islands of the Netherlands Antilles, and Trinidad and Tobago. Flocks gather in wetlands and other marshy habitats, including mud flats, shoreline and rainforest. Outlying colonies have been identified in the coastal areas of the states of Espírito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo (for example in the Santos-Cubatão mangroves of the Baixada Santista district), Paraná and Santa Catarina. In recent years, bird colonies can be seen as far south as in the coastal areas of Joinville and the island of São Francisco do Sul.

The highest concentrations are found in the Llanos region of western Venezuela and eastern Colombia. The fertile and remote tropical grassland plain of the Llanos provides a safe haven far from human encroachment. Together with its relative the bare-faced ibis, the scarlet ibis is remarkably prolific and conspicuous in the region.

Scarlet ibis vagrants have been identified in Belize, Ecuador, and Panama; Aruba, Cuba, Dominica, Grenada, and Jamaica; sightings have even been made in the United States. The species may well have been a natural vagrant to the Gulf Coast in the 19th century or earlier – in &quot;The Birds of America&quot;, John James Audubon made brief remarks regarding three &quot;rubra&quot; specimens he encountered in Louisiana. However, virtually all modern occurrences of the species in North America have been introduced or escaped birds. In one notable example from 1962, scarlet ibis eggs were placed in white ibis nests in Florida&#x27;s Greynolds Park, and the resulting population hybridised easily, producing &quot;pink ibises&quot; that are still occasionally seen.

==Behavior==

===Breeding===

Mating pairs build nests in a simple style, typically &quot;loose platforms of sticks&quot; of a quality described as &quot;artless&quot;. They roost in leaf canopies, mostly preferring the convenient shelter of young waterside mangrove trees. Scarlet ibises like wet, muddy areas such as swamps, but for safety they build their nests in trees well above the water. If they can, they nest on islands, where their eggs and chicks are less likely to be in danger from predators.

To attract a female, the male will perform a variety of mating rituals such as &quot;preening, shaking, bill popping, head rubbing, and high flights. As with most birds, mating does not involve any coupling or insertion: instead, a transfer of seminal fluids occurs during external contact between the cloacal openings. After a gestation period of five to six days, the female lays a clutch of three to five smooth, matte eggs which typically incubate for 19–23 days. After a successful courtship, pairs remain faithful and cohabitant, sharing parental responsibilities for the young.

In southeastern Brazil, the ibises gather in colonies in mid-September and build nests at the beginning of November. Egg laying within the colony was synchronous, with female birds laying eggs in three waves in early November, late December and late January.

===Feeding===
Their distinctive long, thin bills are used to probe for food in soft mud or under plants. Popularly imagined to be eating only shrimp, a recent study in the Llanos has found that much of their diet consists of insects, of which the majority were scarabs and ground beetles. One species in particular, a scarab beetle &quot;Dyscinetus dubius&quot;, formed a large part of the diet. Other insect prey include water beetles and water bugs. In contrast, the diet of the co-occurring American white ibis there differed, the latter consuming more bugs, fish and crustaceans.
They do, however, eat much shrimp and other similar fare like ragworms (&quot;Nereis&quot;), mollusks (such as &quot;Melampus&quot;), small crabs (&quot;Aratus&quot;, &quot;Uca&quot; and &quot;Ucides&quot;) and other crustaceans, such as crayfish. The large quantity of shrimp and other red shellfish produces a surfeit of astaxanthin, a carotenoid which is the key component of the birds&#x27; red pigmentation. Frogs, small snakes, small fish (Cichlidae), fruits and seeds are also occasional prey items for scarlet ibises. When kept in zoos, the birds&#x27; diet often contains beetroot and carrot supplement to maintain color vibrancy in their plumage.

The Llanos are notable in that these wetland plains support seven species of ibis in the one region. Here, scarlet ibis are the most aggressive, and attack other species to steal their food. They have also been observed trailing white-faced whistling ducks (&quot;Dendrocygna viduata&quot;) and domestic livestock, and catching insects disturbed by them.

===Social behavior===
The scarlet ibis is a sociable and gregarious bird, and very communally-minded regarding the search for food and the protection of the young. They live in flocks of thirty or more. Members stay close, and mating pairs arrange their nests in proximity to other pairs in the same tree.

For protection, flocks often congregate in large colonies of several thousand individuals. They also regularly participate in mixed flocks, gaining additional safety through numbers: storks, spoonbills, egrets, herons and ducks are all common companions during feedings and flights.

==Status==
The species has protected status throughout the world, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has classified the scarlet ibis as a species of Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. Though several local populations appear to be in decline, global totals remain relatively large and the current rate of losses is not considered a threat to the species&#x27; survival. Nonetheless, recent losses by established populations in French Guiana have become a concern for conservationists, and in Brazil the bird has been included on a national list of endangered species.

===Relationship with humans===
The scarlet ibis and the rufous-vented chachalaca, popularly known as the cocrico, are the national birds of Trinidad and Tobago respectively. Both birds are featured on the coat of arms of Trinidad and Tobago. The cocrico is found on Tobago, Venezuela and Colombia. The scarlet ibis is associated with Trinidad; there are not documented records of the scarlet ibis on Tobago for the last fifteen years.

An important local habitat for the scarlet ibis is the wildlife sanctuary of Caroni Swamp of Trinidad, a wetland reserve first designated in 1953 specifically to provide a habitat for the scarlet ibis.

Using the bird as a literary symbol, American author James Hurst composed a popular short story, &quot;The Scarlet Ibis&quot; (1960). A more recent short story, &quot;Scarlet Ibis&quot; by Margaret Atwood, is included in &quot;Bluebeard&#x27;s Egg&quot; (1983). The name also belongs to a book of verse by American poet Susan Hahn.

<doc id="237137" wikidata="Q1933884" url="?curid=237137" title="What would Jesus do?">
<text>The phrase &quot;What would Jesus do?&quot;, often abbreviated to WWJD, became particularly popular in the United States in the early 1900s, following the 1896 novel &quot;In His Steps: What Would Jesus Do?&quot; by Charles Sheldon. The phrase saw a resurgence in the 1990s as a personal motto for Christians, who used it as a reminder of their belief in the moral imperative in a way that demonstrated the love of Jesus through their actions. The resurgence of the motto in the 1990s stemmed from the WWJD abbreviation on wristbands that became popular among Christian youth groups.

==History==

===Theological background===

The concept is based on the Epistle to the Galatians chapter 2 verse 20, where Paul of Tarsus says that Christ lives in Christians and was developed with the doctrine of &quot;Imitatio Christi&quot; (imitation of Christ) by Augustine of Hippo in 400.

The Roman Catholic Church emphasizes the concept of &quot;Imitatio Christi&quot; (imitation of Christ), which is summarized in the English phrase &quot;What Would Jesus Do?&quot;

===Earliest use of the phrase===
Charles Spurgeon, a well-known evangelical Baptist preacher in London, used the phrase &quot;what would Jesus do&quot; in quotation marks several times in a sermon he gave on June 28, 1891. In his sermon he cites the source of the phrase as a book written in Latin by Thomas à Kempis between 1418 and 1427, &quot;Imitatio Christi&quot; (The Imitation of Christ).

The Rev. A.B. Simpson, founder of the Christian and Missionary Alliance Church, wrote both the lyrics and music of a Gospel Hymn &quot;What Would Jesus Do&quot; with a copyright date of 1891. It can be found at #669 in &quot;Hymns of the Christian Life&quot;.

===1896 novel===
Charles Sheldon&#x27;s 1896 book &quot;In His Steps&quot; was subtitled &quot;What Would Jesus Do?&quot; Sheldon&#x27;s novel grew out of a series of sermons he delivered in his Congregationalist church in Topeka, Kansas. Unlike the previous nuances mentioned above, Sheldon&#x27;s theology was shaped by a commitment to Christian socialism. The ethos of Sheldon&#x27;s approach to the Christian life was expressed in this phrase &quot;What Would Jesus Do&quot;, with Jesus being a moral example as well as a Saviour figure. Sheldon&#x27;s ideas coalesced with those that formed into the Social Gospel espoused by Walter Rauschenbusch. Indeed, Rauschenbusch acknowledged that his Social Gospel owed its inspiration directly to Sheldon&#x27;s novel, and Sheldon himself identified his own theology with the Social Gospel.

Due to a mistake by the original publisher, the copyright for Sheldon&#x27;s novel was never established and multiple publishers were able to print and sell the novel. This caused the novel to be easily affordable and it sold 30 million copies worldwide, making it one of the top 50 bestselling novels ever.

In this popular novel (it had been translated into 21 languages by 1935), Rev. Henry Maxwell encounters a homeless man who challenges him to take seriously the imitation of Christ. The homeless man has difficulty understanding why, in his view, so many Christians ignore the poor:

&lt;poem&gt;I heard some people singing at a church prayer meeting the other night,

&quot;All for Jesus, all for Jesus,
All my being&#x27;s ransomed powers,
All my thoughts, and all my doings,
All my days, and all my hours.&quot;

and I kept wondering as I sat on the steps outside just what they meant by it. It seems to me there&#x27;s an awful lot of trouble in the world that somehow wouldn&#x27;t exist if all the people who sing such songs went and lived them out. I suppose I don&#x27;t understand. But what would Jesus do? Is that what you mean by following His steps? It seems to me sometimes as if the people in the big churches had good clothes and nice houses to live in, and money to spend for luxuries, and could go away on summer vacations and all that, while the people outside the churches, thousands of them, I mean, die in tenements, and walk the streets for jobs, and never have a piano or a picture in the house, and grow up in misery and drunkenness and sin.&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

This leads to many of the novel&#x27;s characters asking, &quot;What would Jesus do?&quot; when faced with decisions of some importance. This has the effect of making the characters embrace Christianity more seriously and to focus on what they see as its corethe life of Christ.

In 1993, Garrett W. Sheldon (great-grandson of the original author) and Deborah Morris published &quot;What Would Jesus Do? : a contemporary retelling of Charles M. Sheldon&#x27;s classic In His Steps&quot;. Garrett Sheldon states that his updated version &quot;is based on many actual events in the lives of believers.&quot;

It is possible that Sheldon was familiar with either Spurgeon or Thomas, or that he was independently inspired.

===1990s===
At Calvary Reformed Church, in Holland, Michigan, a youth group leader named Janie Tinklenberg began a grassroots movement to help the teenagers in her group remember the phrase; it spread worldwide in the 1990s among Christian youth, who wore bracelets bearing the initials WWJD. Later, a sequel bracelet was generated with the initials &quot;FROG,&quot; to provide an answer to &quot;WWJD.&quot; FROG was an acronym for &quot;Fully Rely On God.&quot;

===2000s===
In 2005, Garry Wills wrote &quot;What Jesus Meant&quot;, in which he examined &quot;What Would Jesus Really Do&quot; (also a book review in &quot;Esquire Magazine&quot;).

===2010s===
A trio of films were released under the &quot;WWJD&quot; moniker. The first, starring John Schneider and Adam Gregory, was released in 2010. The 2012 film &quot;The Woodcarver&quot; used the moniker &quot;WWJD II&quot;, with similar themes but different characters. Schneider returned for the 2015 film, subtitled &quot;The Journey Continues&quot;. 

==Snowclones==
The expression has become a snowclone with the promotion of phrases such as &quot;What would Lincoln do?&quot;, &quot;What would Reagan do?&quot;, and &quot;What Would Brian Boitano Do?&quot;

<doc id="237138" wikidata="Q178811" url="?curid=237138" title="Glossy ibis">
<text>The glossy ibis (Plegadis falcinellus) is a water bird in the order Pelecaniformes and the ibis and spoonbill family Threskiornithidae. The scientific name derives from Ancient Greek &quot;plegados&quot; and Latin, &quot;falcis&quot;, both meaning &quot;sickle&quot; and referring to the distinctive shape of the bill.

==Distribution==

This is the most widespread ibis species, breeding in scattered sites in warm regions of Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and the Atlantic and Caribbean regions of the Americas. It is thought to have originated in the Old World and spread naturally from Africa to northern South America in the 19th century, from where it spread to North America. The glossy ibis was first documented in the New World in 1817 (New Jersey). Audubon saw the species just once in Florida in 1832. It expanded its range substantially northwards in the 1940s and to the west in the 1980s. This species is migratory; most European birds winter in Africa, and in North America birds from north of the Carolinas winter farther south. Though generally suspected to be a migratory species in India, the glossy ibis is resident in western India. Birds from other populations may disperse widely outside the breeding season. It is increasing in Europe. It disappeared as a regular breeding bird in Spain in the early 20th century, but re-established itself in 1993 and has since rapidly increased with thousands of pairs in several colonies. It has also established rapidly increasing breeding colonies in France, a country with very few breeding records before the 2000s. An increasing number of non-breeding visitors are seen in northwestern Europe, a region where glossy ibis records historically were very rare. For example, there appears to be a growing trend for birds to winter in Britain and Ireland, with at least 22 sightings in 2010. In 2014, a pair attempted to breed in Lincolnshire, the first such attempt in Britain. The first successful breeding in Britain was a pair which fledged one young in Cambridgeshire in 2022. A few birds now spend most summers in Ireland, but there is no present evidence of breeding. In New Zealand, a few birds arrive there annually, mostly in the month of July; recently a pair bred amongst a colony of royal spoonbill. Glossy ibis have been a breeding species in Australia since the 1930s. In India, they are now a breeding species with colonies now seen in agricultural areas, in forested areas with bamboo thickets and breeding alongside other colonially nesting waterbirds. Year-long studies have also shown Glossy ibises to be foraging in agricultural wetlands and flooded farmlands in western India. 

==Behaviour==
Glossy ibises undertake dispersal movements after breeding and are highly nomadic. The more northerly populations are fully migratory and travel on a broad front, for example across the Sahara Desert. Glossy ibis ringed in the Black Sea seem to prefer the Sahel and West Africa to winter, those ringed in the Caspian Sea have been found to move to East Africa, the Arabian peninsula and as far east as Pakistan and India. Numbers of glossy ibis in western India varied dramatically seasonally with the highest numbers being seen in the winter and summers, and drastically declining in the monsoon likely indicating local movements to a suitable area to breed. Populations in temperate regions breed during the local spring, while tropical populations nest to coincide with the rainy season. Nesting is often in mixed-species colonies. When not nesting, flocks of over 100 individuals may occur on migration, and during the winter or dry seasons the species is usually found foraging in small flocks. Glossy ibises often roost communally at night in large flocks, with other species, occasionally in trees which can be some distance from wetland feeding areas.

==Habitat==
Glossy ibises feed in very shallow water and nest in freshwater or brackish wetlands with tall dense stands of emergent vegetation such as reeds, papyrus (or rushes) and low trees or bushes. They show a preference for marshes at the margins of lakes and rivers but can also be found at lagoons, flood-plains, wet meadows, swamps, reservoirs, sewage ponds, paddies and irrigated farmland. When using farmlands in western India, glossy ibis exhibited strong scale-dependent use of the landscape seasonally. They preferred using areas with &gt;200 ha of wetlands during the summer, and using areas that had intermediate amounts of wetlands (50-100 ha) in the other seasons, though did not necessarily forage in the wetlands. It is less commonly found in coastal locations such as estuaries, deltas, salt marshes and coastal lagoons. Preferred roosting sites are normally in large trees which may be distant from the feeding areas. When human persecution is absent they roost in cities, even using trees beside busy highways and other roads.

==Breeding==

The nest is usually a platform of twigs and vegetation positioned at least above water, sometimes up to high, in dense stands of emergent vegetation, low trees, or bushes. 3 to 4 eggs (occasionally 5) are laid, and are incubated by both male and female birds for between 20 and 23 days. The young can leave the nest after about 7 days, but the parents continue to feed them for another 6 or 7 weeks. The young fledge in about 28 days.
==Diet==
The diet of the glossy ibis is variable according to the season and is very dependent on what is available. Prey includes adult and larval insects such as aquatic beetles, dragonflies, damselflies, grasshoppers, crickets, flies and caddisflies, Annelida including leeches, molluscs (e.g. snails and mussels), crustaceans (e.g. crabs and crayfish) and occasionally fish, amphibians, lizards, small snakes and nestling birds.

==Description==
This species is a mid-sized ibis. It is long, averaging around with an wingspan. The culmen measures in length, each wing measures , the tail is and the tarsus measures . The body mass of this ibis can range from . Breeding adults have reddish-brown bodies and shiny bottle-green wings. Non-breeders and juveniles have duller bodies. This species has a brownish bill, dark facial skin bordered above and below in blue-gray (non-breeding) to cobalt blue (breeding), and red-brown legs. Unlike herons, ibises fly with necks outstretched, their flight being graceful and often in V formation. It also has shiny feathers.

Sounds made by this rather quiet ibis include a variety of croaks and grunts, including a hoarse &quot;grrrr&quot; made when breeding.
==Gallery==
==Conservation==
The glossy ibis is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies. Glossy ibises can be threatened by wetland habitat degradation and loss through drainage, increased salinity, groundwater extraction and invasion by exotic plants.

The common name black curlew may be a reference to the glossy ibis and this name appears in Anglo-Saxon literature. Yalden and Albarella do not mention this species as occurring in medieval England.

<doc id="237140" wikidata="Q6910972" url="?curid=237140" title="More Joy in Heaven">
<text>More Joy in Heaven is a novel written by Canadian author Morley Callaghan and published in 1937.
The central figure, Kip Caley, was inspired by Norman Ryan (1895-1936), a criminal who had committed a number of robberies in Quebec, Ontario and the United States. The title derives from the biblical quote &quot;&quot;I say to you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repents, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance&quot;.&quot; Luke 15:7.

Callaghan&#x27;s friend Ernest Hemingway had also considered writing a novel based on Ryan&#x27;s life. As a reporter for &quot;The Toronto Daily Star&quot;, Hemingway had covered the criminal in 1925. Dramatised as a radio play by Donald Jack for CBC Theatre 10:30.

==Plot introduction==
Powerful and moving Story of an Ex-Criminal&#x27;s struggle for rehabilitation.

==Synopsis==
The story of Kip Caley, an ex-criminal, intent on becoming a useful and honourable human being. His struggle with himself and with a society which will not let him regain his human dignity.

==List of Main Characters==
Kip Caley-protagonist, Kip was in jail for 10 years for robbing banks all around the six. Kip was let out around Christmas( a time for new beginnings). He tries to have a normal and simple life after he is out but is glamorized by local reporters and journalists.

Other important characters in the book are Julie, Father Butler, Senator Maclean, Kip&#x27;s mother, Harvey Jenkins, Judge Ford, Foley and Kerrmann.

<doc id="237141" wikidata="Q5264322" url="?curid=237141" title="Design choice">
<text>A design choice describes the planned way to satisfy an engineering development requirement in a way that could be satisfied differently. Often, there are multiple ways to satisfy a requirement, which necessitates making choices to select from possible design options. Selection is often based on financial considerations, often resulting in the least expensive option.

In civil engineering, design choices typically derive from basic principles of materials science and structural design. A suspension bridge, for example, uses the fact that steel is extremely efficient in tension, while a prestressed concrete bridge takes advantage of concrete&#x27;s relatively low cost by weight and its ability to sustain high compressive loading (see compression).

<doc id="237143" wikidata="Q746696" url="?curid=237143" title="White-faced ibis">
<text>The white-faced ibis (Plegadis chihi) is a wading bird in the ibis family, Threskiornithidae.

This species breeds colonially in marshes, usually nesting in bushes or low trees. Its breeding range extends from the western United States south through Mexico, as well as from southeastern Brazil and southeastern Bolivia south to central Argentina, and along the coast of central Chile. Its winter range extends from southern California and Louisiana south to include the rest of its breeding range.

==Description==
In its non-breeding plumage, the white-faced ibis is very similar to the glossy ibis except that it tends to be slightly smaller and its plumage has a somewhat warmer color. Breeding adults have a pink, bare face bordered with white feathers (rather than a bluish bare face with no bordering feathers), a grey bill, and brighter-colored, redder legs. Adults have red eyes year-round, whereas glossy ibises have dark eyes. Juveniles of the two species are nearly identical.

Measurements:

* Length: 18.1-22.1 in (46-56 cm)
* Weight: 15.9-18.5 oz (450-525 g)
* Wingspan: 35.4-36.6 in (90-93 cm)
==Distribution==
The white-faced ibis occurs in Canada, the United States, and Central America, and a second subspecies inhabits the southern half of South America, east of the Andes Mountains. In 2012, the total population size was estimated to be 1.2 million individuals, and increasing. The IUCN rates it as being of Least Concern.

Migration and interchange between North and South American subspecies does not occur. Within North America, birds breeding in northern areas of the range move south to wintering areas. For example, breeders in northern California and southern Oregon move to wintering areas in southern California and México or Central America. Some birds breeding in Yellowstone in Wyoming will overwinter in areas such as Texas and coastal Gulf of Mexico regions.
==Origin==
The white-faced ibis bears a strong resemblance to the related glossy ibis, and in the past was sometimes considered to be a subspecies of the glossy ibis. Another theory was that a small population of glossy ibis dispersed to the Americas, which became isolated and evolved into a separate species. However, recent molecular phylogenetic studies show that the white-faced ibis may actually be paraphyletic. In fact, members of the white-faced ibis populations in the United States appear to be more closely related to glossy ibises than to members of white-faced ibis populations in Southern Brazil.

==Feeding==
The white-faced ibis eats a variety of organisms, including many invertebrates such as insects, leeches, snails, crayfish and earthworms. It may also eat vertebrates such as fish, newts, and frogs. Its feeding style is to use its bill to probe for prey.
==Breeding and nesting==

This species breeds colonially in marshes, usually nesting in bushes or low trees. Its breeding range extends from the western United States south through Mexico, as well as from southeastern Brazil and southeastern Bolivia south to central Argentina, and along the coast of central Chile. Its winter range extends from southern California and Louisiana south to include the rest of its breeding range.
The white-faced ibis chooses to nest in the parts of a marsh with dense vegetation such as bulrush, cattails, shrubs, and short trees. It will then build a nest from reeds. The white-faced ibis usually lays three or four blue-green eggs at a time.

==Lifespan==
White-faced ibises in captivity live up to fourteen years on average. In the wild, white-faced ibises usually live for nine years; however, the oldest recorded wild white-faced ibis lived for fourteen years and six months.

==Threats==
In the past, the white-faced ibis faced many threats from humans. Studies completed in Utah in the 1960s (before this species was added to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act) showed that 82.9% of recorded deaths in banded birds were a result of being shot. However, the main causes of the decline of this species previously were pesticides and habitat destruction. The pesticide DDT caused eggshells to be so thin and fragile that parent white-faced ibises crushed the eggs when they were incubating them. Also, since this species is so dependent on wetlands and marshes for both feeding and nesting, changes to water systems such as pollution and man-made draining of water habitats had devastating impacts on members of this species in the past. In order to correct these damages, DDT was banned in 1970 and various programs were created to better maintain and protect wetland nesting habitats. Yet, there is still some debate whether populations of white-faced ibises in all geographic areas are recovered and growing.
