<text>Ross Robinson (born February 13, 1967) is an American record producer who discovered acts such as Korn, Glassjaw, The Blood Brothers, Slipknot, and Limp Bizkit. Robinson has also worked with Tech N9ne, The Cure, Sepultura, and many others.

==Biography==
The son of Bob Robinson and inspirational speaker Byron Katie, Robinson began as a thrash metal guitarist for the bands Detente and Murdercar and picked up his knowledge of producing from the studios where his band recorded demos and also worked at Blackie Lawless&#x27;s studio, Fort Apache, in Burbank, CA. Robinson received his first production job for the 1991 Fear Factory album &quot;Concrete&quot;. Robinson would use the album as a showcase of sorts in helping him land producing slots with other acts, particularly the up-and-coming band Korn.

Robinson is regarded as &quot;The Godfather of Nu Metal&quot;, along with Korn frontman Jonathan Davis, despite denouncing the nu metal movement later on for becoming complacent and the newer bands for not expanding on the style that he helped create with Korn&#x27;s first album, &quot;Korn&quot; (1994).

Robinson has also been successful in the post-hardcore genre, producing At the Drive-In&#x27;s album, &quot;Relationship of Command&quot; in 2000, as well as Glassjaw&#x27;s albums, &quot;Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence&quot; (2000) and &quot;Worship and Tribute&quot; (2002). Robinson has also worked with the likes of The Cure on their eponymous album (2004) and From First to Last on their album &quot;Heroine&quot; (2006).

In 2003 he produced The Blood Brothers&#x27; &quot;...Burn, Piano Island, Burn&quot;, which was a departure for both the band and Robinson. In contrast to The Blood Brothers&#x27; previously raw, often under-produced songs (which lasted as short as 90 seconds at times), &quot;...Burn, Piano Island, Burn&quot; featured much longer and more complex compositions.

Robinson was the owner of the IAM: Wolfpack label. In 2007 it was announced that he was starting a new label IAM: Wolfpack, which released the debut CD from Black Light Burns titled &quot;Cruel Melody&quot;. He is a co-owner of semi-private NY nightclub The Plumm, along with David Wells, Jesse Bradford, Noel Ashman and others.

From 2008, Robinson decided to produce new talents he discovered via Myspace. He recorded and mixed a young French trio called My Own Private Alaska, which mixes classical piano and scream based vocals. Their &quot;Amen&quot; album was released on March 1, 2010, through his label I Am Recordings.

He worked with the Slovenian band Siddharta on their new project Saga. He also produced Repeater&#x27;s second album, &quot;We Walk from Safety&quot;.

Robinson has been producing indie rock bands such British bands Klaxons and Dananananaykroyd. In late 2008, the Luxembourgish dance rock band INBORN! were approached by Robinson. Having heard the band on the net, he offered to record their first official long player. The band entered Robinson&#x27;s studio on October 1, 2010.

In 2010, Robinson returned to produce Korn&#x27;s ninth album, 14 years after last working with band. Korn wanted to recapture the raw energy of the first two albums which Robinson produced.

In 2013, Robinson produced Tech N9ne&#x27;s rock EP &quot;Therapy&quot;.

Robinson also worked with Sepultura for their 2013 album &quot;The Mediator Between Head and Hands Must Be the Heart&quot;.

As of 2017, he has recently worked with The Used, Suicide Silence, and Frank Iero and the Patience among others.

Robinson had a minor role in producing Limp Bizkit&#x27;s sixth studio album, then titled &quot;Stampede of the Disco Elephants&quot;, however such contributions were later discarded after the album&#x27;s refactoring and 2021 release.

<text>This is a list of monarchs of Württemberg, containing the Counts, Dukes, Electors, and Kings who reigned over different territories named Württemberg from the beginning of the County of Württemberg in the 11th century to the end of the Kingdom of Württemberg in 1918.

== Counts and Dukes of Württemberg ==
===House of Württemberg===

====Partitions of Württemberg under Württemberg rule====

====Table of monarchs====

== Elector of Württemberg, 1803–1806 ==
In 1803, the Duke of Württemberg was raised to the rank of Elector of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1806, the Empire was dissolved, and the Elector of Württemberg became an independent monarch with the title of King.


== Kings of Württemberg, 1806–1918 ==
The Holy Roman Empire came to an end in 1806. The Elector of Württemberg, allied to Napoleon, anticipated its dissolution by becoming the ruler of an independent Kingdom of Württemberg in 1806.
Because of a lack of male heirs under Salic law, on the death of Wilhelm II in 1921 the royal house had to reach back to the descendants of Friedrich II Eugen (ruled 1795–97). The line of the Duke of Urach was excluded because of a morganatic marriage back in 1800 by its forebear Duke William, and so the succession devolved to the younger branch of Altshausen.

Another morganatic descendant of Friedrich II Eugen was Mary of Teck (1867–1953), who married the British king George V when he was Duke of York.

<doc id="236774" wikidata="Q3443410" url="?curid=236774" title="Lori Piestewa">
<text>Lori Ann Piestewa ( ; December 14, 1979 – March 23, 2003) was a United States Army soldier killed during the Iraq War. A member of the Quartermaster Corps, she died in the same Iraqi attack in which fellow soldiers Shoshana Johnson and Piestewa&#x27;s friend Jessica Lynch were injured. A Hopi, Piestewa was the first Native American woman to die in combat while serving in the U.S. military and the first woman in the U.S. military killed in the Iraq War. Arizona&#x27;s Piestewa Peak is named in her honor.

==Early life and education==
Piestewa was born in Tuba City, Arizona, to Terry Piestewa and Priscilla &quot;Percy&quot; Baca. Her father is Hopi Native American and her mother is Mexican-American. The couple first met in 1964 and married in November 1968.

The Piestewa family had a long military tradition; her paternal grandfather served in the U.S. Army in the European Theatre of World War II, and her father Terry Piestewa was drafted in the U.S. Army in September 1965 and served a tour of duty in the Vietnam War before he returned home in March 1967.

The Piestewa family resided in Tuba City, a town located on the Navajo Indian Reservation in Coconino County. As a child, she was given the Hopi name &quot;Qötsa-Hon-Mana&quot; (; &quot;White Bear Girl&quot;). Her surname is derived from a Hopi language root meaning &quot;water pooled on the desert by a hard rain&quot;; thus, &quot;Piestewa&quot; () translates loosely as &quot;the people who live by the water.&quot;

==Ambush in Nasiriyah, Iraq==
Piestewa was a member of the US Army&#x27;s 507th Maintenance Company, a support unit of maintenance and repair personnel. Her company was traveling in a convoy through the desert and was meant to bypass Nasiriyah, in southern Iraq, during the opening days of the war; but the convoy got lost and ran into an ambush in Nasiriyah on March 23, 2003.

As Piestewa came under &quot;a torrent of fire&quot; (in the words of an Army investigation of the battle) she drove at high speed, evading enemy fire until a rocket-propelled grenade hit her Humvee. The explosion sent her vehicle into the rear of a disabled tractor-trailer. Piestewa, Johnson, and Lynch all survived the crash with injuries, while three other soldiers in the Humvee died. They were taken prisoner along with four others, with Piestewa dying of her wounds soon after. A video of some of the American prisoners of war, including Piestewa (filmed shortly before she died in an Iraqi hospital), was later shown around the world on Al Jazeera television. According to Jessica Lynch&#x27;s book—&quot;I&#x27;m a Soldier, Too: The Jessica Lynch Story&quot;—Piestewa was wounded in the head, and performing delicate neurosurgery in an Iraqi civilian hospital was impossible in wartime conditions (due to limitations such as intermittent electric power).

The families of soldiers in the 507th heard almost right away of the ambush and fatalities in the unit. The Piestewa family saw people in her unit being interviewed by Iraqi TV, and for more than a week, families of the two women waited for news. All around Tuba City, signs were hung out telling people: &quot;Put your porch light on, show Lori the way home.&quot; They used white stone to spell her name on a 200-foot-high mesa just outside the town.

==Legacy==
Piestewa was awarded the Purple Heart and Prisoner of War Medal. The U.S. Army posthumously promoted her from private first class to specialist.

Lynch has repeatedly stated that Piestewa was the true heroine of the ambush and named her daughter Dakota Ann in honor of her fallen comrade. In addition, many entities have honored her memory with memorials. When Arizona&#x27;s state government was deciding what to rename Squaw Peak in the Phoenix Mountains near Phoenix due to the former name&#x27;s offensive nature, it was decided to rename it as Piestewa Peak to honor the Arizona native. This was codified by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names on April 10, 2008; the freeway that passes near this mountain was also renamed in her honor. In addition, Senator Tom Daschle honored her, as did Indian Nations across the United States. Since her death, the Grand Canyon State Games organizers have held an annual Lori Piestewa National Native American Games, which brings participants from across the country. A plaque bearing her name is also located at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, and Fort Bliss, Texas. She has also been memorialized with a plaque and ceremony at Mount Soledad Veterans Memorial in La Jolla, California. On November 10, 2011, American Legion Post No. 80 on the Hopi Reservation was renamed the Lori Piestewa Post # 80. On November 30, 2011, the Directorate of Training Sustainment headquarters at Fort Moore, Georgia was named Piestewa Hall in her honor.

Her death led to a rare joint prayer gathering between members of the Hopi and Navajo tribes, which have had a centuries-old rivalry.

In May 2005, Piestewa&#x27;s parents and children had a brand-new home built by Ty Pennington and his crew on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Extreme Makeover: Home Edition&quot; accompanied by Jessica Lynch. They also built a new veterans&#x27; center on the Navajo reservation.

In 2018, Piestewa became one of the inductees in the first induction ceremony held by the National Native American Hall of Fame.

<doc id="236780" wikidata="Q57180" url="?curid=236780" title="Frederick William IV of Prussia">
<text>Frederick William IV (; 15 October 1795 – 2 January 1861), the eldest son and successor of Frederick William III of Prussia, was King of Prussia from 7 June 1840 until his death on 2 January 1861. Also referred to as the &quot;romanticist on the throne&quot;, he was deeply religious and believed that he ruled by divine right. He feared revolutions, and his ideal state was one governed by the Christian estates of the realm rather than a constitutional monarchy.

In spite of his conservative political philosophy, he initially pursued a moderate policy of easing press censorship, releasing political prisoners and reconciling with the Catholic population of the kingdom. During the German revolutions of 1848–1849, he was initially forced to accommodate the people&#x27;s revolutionary sentiments, although he rejected the title of Emperor of the Germans offered by the Frankfurt Parliament in 1849, believing that it did not have the right to make such an offer. In December 1848, he dissolved the Prussian National Assembly when he found its constitutional proposals too radical. At the urging of his ministry, which wanted to prevent a renewal of unrest, he imposed a constitution with a parliament and a strong monarch. He then used the Prussian military to help put down revolutionary forces throughout the German Confederation.

Frederick William IV had an artistic nature and an interest in architecture. He extended the building ensembles of the Berlin-Potsdam Residence Landscape, Museum Island, and the cultural landscape of the Upper Middle Rhine Valley, and he supported the completion of the Cologne Cathedral. All are now UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

From 1857 to 1861, he suffered several strokes and was left incapacitated until his death. His brother and heir presumptive William served as regent after 1858 and then succeeded him as king.

==Crown Prince==
Born to Frederick William III and his wife Queen Louise, Frederick William was his mother&#x27;s favourite son. He was educated by private tutors, including the historian and statesman Friedrich Ancillon. When Queen Louise died in 1810 when Frederick William was 14, he saw it as a punishment from God and linked it directly to his outlook on life. He believed that only by leading a life more pleasing to God would he be able to absolve himself of the guilt he felt for her death.

Frederick William&#x27;s early childhood fell during a period in which the European monarchies were confronted with the revolutionary challenge of the French Revolution. By calling the dynastic tradition into question, the execution of Louis XVI in 1793 helped create the conditions for Frederick William&#x27;s later political orientation towards historical continuity and tradition. Since there was a danger that he and his younger brother William might be captured by the French after the Prussians lost the Battle of Jena–Auerstedt on 14 October 1806, they were taken to Königsberg in East Prussia on 17 October 1806. After their parents arrived on 9 December 1806, they fled together from the advancing troops to Memel.After Prussia&#x27;s defeat and the family&#x27;s return to Berlin, Frederick William&#x27;s education was adapted more to prepare him for governing. He was generally dismissive of the Prussian reforms that were then underway with the aim of modernising the state from within. His tutor Friedrich Delbrück had instilled in him a disgust of revolutionaries, so that he had no sympathy for Karl August von Hardenberg&#x27;s insistence that Prussia be reorganised through a &quot;revolution from above&quot;. For Friedrich Wilhelm, the &quot;bureaucratic absolutism of a Hardenberg&quot; meant moving away from the &quot;principle of the estates&quot; that he advocated.

The high point of Frederick William&#x27;s youth was his participation in the campaigns against Napoleon in the Wars of Liberation of 1813/1814 that pushed the French out of Germany. In his experience with war, which showed him to be an indifferent soldier, the boundaries between patriotism and religious fervour became blurred. He saw the conflict as a crusade against the ideas of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution. In many pieces of correspondence from the period, the Crown Prince wrote about religious experiences using elements of the Pietist revivalist movement, including the subjective experience of God, the power of personal prayer and individual striving for salvation and redemption.

Frederick William was a Romanticist, and his devotion to the movement, which in the German states featured nostalgia for the Middle Ages, played a part in his developing a conservative worldview at an early age. In 1815, when he was twenty, the Crown Prince exerted his influence to structure the proposed new constitution of 1815, which was never enacted, in such a way that the landed aristocracy would hold the greatest power. He was against the liberalisation of Germany and aspired to unify its many states within what he viewed as a historically legitimate framework, inspired by the ancient laws and customs of the Holy Roman Empire, which had been dissolved under Napoleon in 1806.

He was a draftsman interested in both architecture and landscape gardening and was a patron of several great German artists, including architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel and composer Felix Mendelssohn. In 1823 he married Elisabeth Ludovika of Bavaria. Since she was a Roman Catholic, the preparations for the marriage included difficult negotiations which ended with her conversion to Lutheranism. There were two wedding ceremonies – one in Munich by proxy according to the Catholic rite, and the other in person in Berlin. The couple had a harmonious marriage, but after Louise had a miscarriage in 1828, it remained childless.

== Early reign ==
Frederick William became king of Prussia on the death of his father in 1840. Through a personal union, he was also the sovereign prince of the Principality of Neuchâtel (1840–1857), which at the same time was a canton in the Swiss Confederation and the only one that was a principality. In 1842, he gave his father&#x27;s menagerie at Pfaueninsel to the new Berlin Zoo, which opened its gates in 1844 as the first of its kind in Germany. Other projects during his reign – often involving his close collaboration with the architects – included the &quot;Alte Nationalgalerie&quot; (Old National Gallery) and the &quot;Neues Museum&quot; in Berlin, the Orangery Palace at Potsdam as well as the reconstruction of Stolzenfels Castle on the Rhine and Hohenzollern Castle, in the ancestral homelands of the dynasty which became part of Prussia in 1850. He also enlarged and redecorated his father&#x27;s Erdmannsdorf manor house.

In 1842, on the advice of Alexander von Humboldt, he founded the separate civil class of the Pour le Merite, the Order Pour le Mérite for Sciences and Arts (&quot;Orden Pour le Mérite für Wissenschaften und Künste&quot;). The civil order is still being awarded today.

Frederick William IV&#x27;s accession to the throne came with great expectations among liberals and nationalists. By beginning his reign with a policy of reconciliation, the new king fulfilled their hopes during his first six months on the throne. Through an amnesty enacted on 10 August 1840, all &quot;political criminals&quot; were released, politically motivated investigations and court proceedings were discontinued, and press censorship was eased.

As a result of the concessions, liberals initially overlooked the fact that Frederick William IV was not of one mind with them. The King intended his policy of reconciliation to restore trust in a medieval-feudal relationship of loyalty between the Prussian people and the monarch, making the liberal reform of the state along the lines of the French constitutional-parliamentary model superfluous. He believed that he derived his close ties to his people from the divine right of grace, which gave him a &quot;sacred insight into the needs of his subjects&quot;. Any restriction of his de facto absolutist power seemed to him to be an irresponsible obstruction of his divinely ordained mission.

=== Religious policy ===
Frederick William IV was deeply religious. Influenced by Romanticism and the Pietist revivalist movement, he envisioned a Christian state and believed that only Christianity could protect his subjects from revolutionary utopias and reverse the secularisation, growing materialism and other processes of modernisation that he considered harmful. For Friedrich Wilhelm, religion and politics were inextricably linked.

In contrast to his father, Frederick William was sympathetic to Catholicism. Under Frederick William III in 1825, the Archbishop of Cologne was arrested in a conflict over the law on mixed marriages. In order to reconcile with the Catholic population, Frederick William IV authorised the founding of the Cologne Cathedral Building Association in 1840 to promote and finance the completion of the Cologne Cathedral. Half of the funding for it came from the Prussian state treasury. For negotiations with the Roman Curia, the King announced in June 1840 that within the Ministry of Culture he would set up a department for Catholic affairs which was to consist exclusively of Catholic councillors.

With the founding of the Protestant Church in Prussia in 1817, in which Calvinists and Lutherans were united, Friedrich Wilhelm&#x27;s father had created an institution for all Protestants in his kingdom that was directly dependent on the sovereign as the &quot;summus episcopus&quot; (high bishop). In response, the Old Lutherans formed their own church in 1830, claiming to represent the &quot;true&quot; Lutheran Church, and were consequently subjected to state persecution. In 1845 Frederick William lifted the ban on the formation of Old Lutheran churches and released imprisoned pastors.

=== The constitutional question ===
As part of his policy of reconciliation, Frederick William IV was interested in finding a solution to the question of a constitution for Prussia. At the core of his political philosophy was the doctrine of the organic nation of the estates of the realm, which was based on philosophers such as Friedrich Schlegel, who wrote in 1805: &quot;The only lasting constitution is the monarchy of the estates, tempered by priests and nobility, and it is also the oldest and best.&quot; In the view of the &quot;political romantics&quot;, the structure of the estates took the natural inequality of man into account. Individuals should fulfil the tasks and duties that serve the good of society as a whole in the place assigned to them by God. In the Prussian constitutional question, Frederick William IV was not striving for the realisation of a constitutional monarchy but rather a state governed by the Christian estates. He made this clear to the governor of the province of Prussia not long after his coronation:
I feel myself [to be king] entirely by the grace of God and will feel that way with His help until the end. Without envy I leave splendour and artifice to so-called constitutional princes, who have become a fiction, an abstract concept to the people through a piece of paper [a constitution]. 

As his alternative to parliamentary-style popular legislatures, Frederick William IV focussed his attention on the Provincial Estates, the representative bodies of the eight Prussian provinces, which had been founded in 1823. In 1847 he summoned all representatives of the Prussian provincial parliaments to Berlin. He was prepared to give the United Parliament the right to discuss the financing of railways, canals and roads – specifically a request for a 25 million thaler bond for building the Berlin to Königsberg railway. He did not want to levy new taxes or take out loans without the United Parliament&#x27;s consent, envisioning that their approval would not restrict his power but strengthen it by eliminating future constitutional demands.

In his opening speech, Frederick William reiterated that he did not want a &quot;piece of paper&quot; to come between himself and the people and replace the &quot;old, sacred loyalty with it&quot;. He told the deputies of the limits he saw on their duties: &quot;... it is not your job to represent opinions, to want to bring the opinions of the times to the fore. ... That is completely un-German and, beyond that, completely impractical.&quot;

The majority of the deputies nevertheless did not see themselves as representatives of the estates but of the Prussian people. On 20 April 1847, the parliament sent an address to the King calling for a regular convocation. Laws, they wrote, should only come into force with the consent of the United Parliament. Discrimination based on the estates should be abolished and the citizenry guaranteed legal protection against arbitrary measures by the state. If their demands were not fulfilled, they concluded, the parliament would be forced to reject the King&#x27;s spending plans. Frederick William stopped attending parliamentary sessions and on 26 June 1847 dissolved the United Parliament.

With the failure of the First United Parliament, the government not only lost its ability to act on fiscal policy – the Prussian National Debt Act of January 1820 stipulating that the government could only take on new debt if it was co-guaranteed by the &quot;imperial estates&quot; remained in force – but also faced increased doubts within Prussia about the legitimacy of the existing state order.

=== The Industrial Revolution ===
During the reign of Frederick William IV, the Ruhr region, Silesia and Berlin slowly developed into centres of industrialisation. In spite of his politically backward-looking attitude, Frederick William supported the technological progress brought about by the Industrial Revolution, notably by using government bonds to promote the expansion of the railway network. The rapid industrial growth was accompanied by social tensions to which the King did not respond with any significant policies beyond donations to private social associations. In 1844, for example, he provided the Association for the Welfare of the Working Class with 15,000 thalers. The next year he issued a General Prussian Industrial Code that included a ban on strikes and prison sentences of up to a year for conspiring to encourage one.

== The Revolution of 1848/1849 ==
=== Outbreak ===
The overthrow of the French July Monarchy on 24 February 1848 triggered a revolutionary movement throughout Europe. Frederick William IV called for a congress of German states that was to meet in Dresden on 25 March. By discussing reform of the German Confederation, the King hoped to appease the people&#x27;s revolutionary sentiments, but before he could implement his plans, they were overtaken by the events of the revolution in Berlin.
The sound of the fighting could be heard in the Berlin Palace. Although the Berlin barricade battle was one of the most costly incidents of the March Revolution, with 300 casualties among the demonstrators at the hands of Prussian troops, the King rejected any responsibility and instead spread the false report of a foreign conspiracy in his manifesto &#x27;To my dear Berliners&#x27;: &quot;A gang of villains, mostly consisting of foreigners, ... has become the ghastly author of bloodshed.&quot;

On 21 March 1848, the King, or rather his camarilla, initiated an apparent change of course by placing Frederick William IV at the head of the revolution, whereas the truth was that he lacked the means to pursue a policy independent of the citizens&#x27; movement. The King announced that he would support the formation of an all-German parliament, one of the revolution&#x27;s key demands. On 21 March 1848, he rode through the city wearing a black, red and gold armband – the colours of the revolution – and had an officer dressed in civilian clothes carry a similarly coloured flag in front of him. The King repeatedly stopped to make improvised speeches to affirm his alleged support for German unity.

The next day he secretly wrote to his brother William: &quot;I had to voluntarily raise the Reich colours yesterday in order to save everything. If the gamble is successful ... I will take them down again!&quot;

On 29 March 1848, Frederick William appointed a liberal government led by Minister President Ludolf Camphausen and Finance Minister David Hansemann. The following day, the King founded a secret secondary cabinet, the , as a counter to Camphausen&#x27;s government. The courtly interest group, which included General Leopold von Gerlach, his brother Ernst Ludwig von Gerlach and Count Anton of Stolberg-Wernigerode, talked the King out of his short-term plans to abdicate. Otto von Bismarck, the future chancellor of a united Germany, joined the group towards the end of 1848.

=== Prussian National Assembly and the Frankfurt Parliament ===

The second United Parliament called by Frederick William on 2 April 1848 announced elections to form a Prussian National Assembly, which convened in Berlin on 22 May. Frederick William IV submitted a draft constitution in which the balance of power continued to favour the king&#x27;s dominant position in the state. It stipulated that the army and bureaucracy were answerable to the king and not the National Assembly. It also enshrined his view that he was &quot;King by the grace of God&quot; and that the constitution was merely an &quot;agreement between the crown and the people&quot;.

At the beginning of April, a national pre-parliament sitting at Frankfurt-am-Main decided to work with the Federal Convention of the German Confederation to form a national constitutional assembly which would write a new constitution for the Confederation. Elections were held for it on 1 May 1848. Of the 379 members who attended the Frankfurt Parliament&#x27;s first session on 18 May, 132 were from Prussia.

== Counter-revolution ==

=== End of the National Assembly and imposed constitution ===
The Prussian National Assembly rejected the Camphausen government&#x27;s draft constitution on 20 June 1848. Left-wing forces then began to assert themselves more and more clearly. The words &quot;by the grace of God&quot; were removed from the draft on 12 October, openly calling into question the divine right of kings. The break with the crown culminated on 31 October when the Assembly abolished nobility, titles and privileges. Frederick William IV then launched a political counterattack. On 1 November he appointed his uncle Frederick William of Brandenburg, who came from the conservative military camp, as minister president of Prussia. Unlike previous minister presidents during the revolutionary period, Brandenburg was closer to the King than to the National Assembly. The National Assembly sent 25 deputies to the King on 2 November to protest against Brandenburg&#x27;s appointment. He cancelled the audience after the deputies had read out their request.
Under the pretext of removing the National Assembly from the pressure of the Berlin streets, the King told the deputies that they would be moved to Brandenburg an der Havel on 9 November and adjourned until 27 November. After the majority refused to comply, the King ordered General Friedrich von Wrangel to march through the Brandenburg Gate at the head of 13,000 soldiers and sixty guns. That Wrangel met with no resistance was due in part to the disillusionment of the craftsmen and industrial workers with the revolution. It had done nothing to change their economic hardship, which had led to isolated riots. Although the middle and upper classes sympathised with the workers, they did not want a violent social upheaval and sided with the King.

On 5 December the King dissolved the Prussian National Assembly and imposed the Constitution of 1848. Although Frederick William IV personally opposed the idea of introducing a constitution, the majority of his ministry urged him to take the step in order to prevent protests from flaring up again. The first Parliament of Prussia then modified the constitution with the King&#x27;s cooperation, and on 31 January 1850, the Constitution of 1850 was promulgated. The Parliament had two chambers – an aristocratic upper house and a lower house elected by all male Prussians over 25 years of age using a three-class franchise that weighted votes based on the amount of taxes paid, with the result that the wealthy had far more influence than the poor. The constitution reserved to the king the power of appointing all ministers, re-established the conservative district assemblies and provincial diets and guaranteed that the civil service and the military remained firmly under control of the king. It also contained a number of liberal elements such as jury courts and a catalogue of fundamental rights that included freedom of religion, speech and the press. It was a more liberal system than had existed in Prussia before 1848, but it was still a conservative form of government in which the monarch, the aristocracy, and the military retained most of the power. The constitution of 1850 remained in effect, with numerous amendments, until the dissolution of the Prussian kingdom in 1918.

=== Refusal of the imperial title ===
Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria had made it clear in November 1848 that he would not accept the title of &quot;Emperor of the Germans&quot; from the Frankfurt National Assembly because the Frankfurt Constitution would have required German-speaking Austria to have a separate constitution, government and administration from the rest of the Empire. On 28 March 1849, the Assembly elected Frederick William IV as Emperor of the Germans, but he refused the crown. In a letter to a confidant, he wrote: &quot;I can call God to witness that I do not want it, for the simple reason that Austria will then be separated from Germany.&quot;

The exclusion of Austria would have ruined Frederick William IV&#x27;s vision of the renewal of a Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation, of which Austria had been part for centuries. Accepting the imperial dignity would also have meant an open foreign policy snub of Austria and probably have provoked a war. Even more important was the fact that, in the King&#x27;s opinion, the imperial dignity could only be conferred by the princes or a college of electors, as had been the case until 1806. As a representative of the principle of monarchical legitimacy, he detested the idea of a unilateral taking of power that would have violated the historical rights of other German monarchs. The crown offered by representatives of the people was furthermore unacceptable to Frederick William, whose monarchical self-image was based on the traditional idea of divine right and who rejected the idea of popular sovereignty. In a letter dated 13 December 1848, Frederick William stated to the Prussian ambassador to England, Christian Charles Josias von Bunsen: 
Such an imaginary hoop [the crown] baked from dirt and weeds – should a legitimate king of Prussia be pleased with it? [...] I tell you bluntly: If the thousand-year-old crown of the German nation, which has been dormant for 42 years, is to be awarded once again, it is I and those like me who will award it.

=== The Erfurt Union ===
King Frederick Augustus II of Saxony provoked an uprising in Dresden in May 1849 by refusing to accept the Frankfurt Constitution. He wrote a letter to the Prussian king urging him to put down the uprising by force. On 5 May 1849, Frederick William sent Prussian troops to Dresden under Colonel Friedrich von Waldersee, who took control of the city on 9 May. Seven hundred revolutionaries were taken prisoner and 250 killed in the fighting. The suppression of the uprising in Saxony strengthened Prussia&#x27;s negotiating position in its attempt to establish a united German federal state of princes under Prussian leadership.

The basis for the union was the Three Kings&#x27; Alliance of 26 May 1849 between Prussia, the Kingdom of Saxony and the Kingdom of Hanover. The three monarchs committed themselves for a period of one year to work together to realise a conservative imperial constitution based on the Prussian three-class electoral system. Ernst August I of Hanover and Friedrich August II of Saxony, however, only heeded the King&#x27;s request while absolutist Austria was tied up with uprisings in Hungary.

Since eight individual German states, including the Kingdom of Bavaria and the Kingdom of Württemberg, did not participate in the Erfurt Union from the outset, Frederick William IV began to lose interest in the project. By the winter of 1849, the Kingdoms of Hanover and Saxony had withdrawn their consent as well.

In contrast to Prussia, Austria wanted to restore the German Confederation and opposed Prussia&#x27;s Erfurt Union plans. Saxony, Hanover, Bavaria and Württemberg sided with Austria in the Four Kings&#x27; Alliance. With the backing of the conservative opponents of the Erfurt Union in the Prussian government, Austria was able to revive the German Confederation, which had been inactive since the 1848 revolutions. In the Punctation of Olmütz, Prussia declared its willingness to return to the German Confederation without Austria having assured it of legal equality in the leadership of the Confederation.

== Other political events ==
In addition to the 1848 revolution and the constitutional question that dominated Frederick William IV&#x27;s reign, there were a number of other notable political events during his time on the throne:
* The Rhine Crisis of 1840 arose when French Prime Minister Adolphe Thiers demanded that the Rhine be reinstated as France&#x27;s eastern border. The ensuing diplomatic crisis stoked German nationalism and led the German Confederation to improve its defences in the west. The tension ended when Thiers resigned.
* The First Schleswig War in 1848 was a conflict between German forces and Denmark over control of Schleswig and Holstein. Prussia led troops into Denmark but had to back down under pressure from the European great powers.
* The Province of Hohenzollern in southern Germany, the ancestral home of the Hohenzollerns, was created and annexed to Prussia in 1850.
* In the Jade Treaty of 1853, Prussia, which until then had had access to the sea only on the Baltic, purchased land on the North Sea, where the city of Wilhelmshaven was built.
* The Neuchâtel Crisis (1856–1857) was dispute over control of the Principality of Neuchâtel in the Swiss Confederation that led to Prussia cede its historic claim.

== Later years ==

In his final years, the King was affected by a serious illness, the symptoms of which, from the perspective of the medical knowledge of the era, appeared to be a &quot;mental illness&quot;. According to current medical knowledge, Friedrich Wilhelm suffered from a &quot;cerebral vascular disease&quot;, a &quot;cerebral arteriosclerosis&quot;, which &quot;could not be described as a mental illness&quot;. It is likely that psychopathological abnormalities occurred before the strokes he suffered, making him barely able to perform his government offices.

The strokes, which began on 14 July 1857, affected his speech centre. After Prince William&#x27;s term acting as deputy for the King had been extended three times, the ailing Frederick William signed a regency charter for him on 7 October 1858, based on an expert opinion from the royal personal physicians. The charter included the formal possibility of a resumption of official duties.

The signing of the Regency Charter heralded the New Era in Prussia, marking the end of Frederick William IV&#x27;s idea of government. Prince Regent William dismissed the reactionary minister president Otto von Manteuffel and recruited Karl Anton von Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen from the liberal-nationalist camp. He also dismissed the courtiers who had belonged to Frederick William IV&#x27;s camarilla.

=== Death and burial ===

On 24 November 1859, the king suffered a stroke that paralysed his left side. Since he was no longer able to be transported, the court remained at Sanssouci. On 4 November 1860, he lost consciousness after another stroke, and on 2 January 1861 he died. In accordance with his testamentary instructions from 1854, the King was buried in the Friedenskirche in Potsdam after his heart had been removed and buried separately alongside his parents in the mausoleum in Charlottenburg Palace Park.

<doc id="236782" wikidata="Q3775923" url="?curid=236782" title="Kaiser window">
<text>The Kaiser window, also known as the Kaiser–Bessel window, was developed by James Kaiser at Bell Laboratories. It is a one-parameter family of window functions used in finite impulse response filter design and spectral analysis. The Kaiser window approximates the DPSS window which maximizes the energy concentration in the main lobe but which is difficult to compute.

==Definition==

The Kaiser window and its Fourier transform are given by:
:formula_1   .&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* is the zeroth-order modified Bessel function of the first kind,
* is the window duration, and
* is a non-negative real number that determines the shape of the window. In the frequency domain, it determines the trade-off between main-lobe width and side lobe level, which is a central decision in window design.
* Sometimes the Kaiser window is parametrized by , where .

For digital signal processing, the function can be sampled symmetrically as:

:formula_2

where the length of the window is formula_3 and N can be even or odd. (see A list of window functions)

In the Fourier transform, the first null after the main lobe occurs at formula_4 which is just formula_5 in units of N (DFT &quot;bins&quot;). As &quot;α&quot; increases, the main lobe increases in width, and the side lobes decrease in amplitude.   = 0 corresponds to a rectangular window. For large the shape of the Kaiser window (in both time and frequency domain) tends to a Gaussian curve.  The Kaiser window is nearly optimal in the sense of its peak&#x27;s concentration around frequency formula_6
==Kaiser–Bessel-derived (KBD) window==

A related window function is the Kaiser–Bessel-derived (KBD) window, which is designed to be suitable for use with the modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT). The KBD window function is defined in terms of the Kaiser window of length &quot;N&quot;+1, by the formula:
:formula_7

This defines a window of length 2&quot;N&quot;, where by construction &quot;d&quot;&quot;n&quot; satisfies the Princen-Bradley condition for the MDCT (using the fact that ): (interpreting &quot;n&quot; and &quot;n&quot; + &quot;N&quot; modulo 2&quot;N&quot;). The KBD window is also symmetric in the proper manner for the MDCT: &quot;d&quot;&quot;n&quot; = &quot;d&quot;2&quot;N&quot;−1−&quot;n&quot;.

===Applications===
The KBD window is used in the Advanced Audio Coding digital audio format.

<doc id="236786" wikidata="Q328987" url="?curid=236786" title="List of Hessian monarchs">
<text>This is a list of monarchs of Hesse () during the history of Hesse on west-central Germany. These monarchs belonged to a dynasty collectively known as the [[House of Hesse]] and the House of Brabant, originally the Reginar. Hesse was ruled as a landgraviate, electorate and later as a grand duchy until 1918.

The title of all of the following monarchs was &quot;landgrave&quot; () unless otherwise noted.

==Landgraviate of Hesse==
In the early Middle Ages the Hessengau territory (named after the Germanic Chatti tribes) formed the northern parts of the German stem duchy of Franconia along with the adjacent Lahngau. Upon the extinction of the ducal Conradines, these Rhenish Franconian counties were gradually acquired by Landgrave Louis I of Thuringia and his successors.

After the War of the Thuringian Succession upon the death of Landgrave Henry Raspe in 1247, his niece Duchess Sophia of Brabant secured the Hessian possessions for her minor son Henry the Child, who would become the first landgrave of Hesse and founder of the House of Hesse in 1246. The remaining Thuringian landgraviate fell to the Wettin margrave Henry III of Meissen. Henry I of Hesse was raised to princely status by King Adolf of Germany in 1292.

<doc id="236792" wikidata="Q13646199" url="?curid=236792" title="Mallard (band)">
<text>Mallard was the name of an American band featuring ex-members of Captain Beefheart&#x27;s Magic Band.

In early 1974, after the recording of the uncharacteristically mainstream &quot;Unconditionally Guaranteed&quot; album, the tensions between Captain Beefheart and bandmembers Bill Harkleroad (Zoot Horn Rollo), Mark Boston (Rockette Morton) and Art Tripp III (Ed Marimba) had finally reached a breaking point, and the three members left Beefheart&#x27;s Magic Band. Together, they formed Mallard, with Sam Galpin as vocalist and Rabbit Bundrick on keyboards, releasing their eponymous debut album in 1975, with logistical support from Ian Anderson (of Jethro Tull fame), who financed the recording using his mobile recording unit on his English estate. The debut included a version of the Captain Beefheart instrumental &quot;Peon&quot;, as Harkleroad felt the group could improve on the original. Anderson&#x27;s involvement with Mallard included recording with the group, but Harkleroad later destroyed these recordings. John French (Drumbo) was originally involved with the band, and co-wrote some songs.

In 1976, they released their second and last album, &quot;In a Different Climate&quot;, and performed some concerts in the United Kingdom. George Dragotta now had been recruited as their drummer, and after Beefheart fired John Thomas, he too joined on keyboards. Thomas was briefly involved in the Magic Band and in the early 1970s had been in a band called Rattlesnakes and Eggs with John French.

Despite the principal members&#x27; years together and unique musical abilities, as well as support from the British musical press, Mallard never achieved commercial success.

In 1994, both LPs by Mallard were re-released on CD by Virgin Records in the UK and in the US.

<text>Crush is a 2001 romantic comedy film written and directed by John McKay and starring Andie MacDowell, Imelda Staunton, Anna Chancellor, Kenny Doughty, and Bill Paterson.

==Plot==
Forty-something schoolmistress Kate and her two best friends, police superintendent Janine and doctor Molly, live in rural Britain and share their single lives and dating exploits in weekly chats. Kate has recovered from ovarian cyst disease and fears a relapse; she hasn&#x27;t been dating much. By chance, she meets Jed, a former student of hers, now a handsome twenty-something church organist. To her surprise, she ends up sleeping with him and the two embark on an unlikely relationship that&#x27;s looked on with suspicion by Janine and Molly. Janine comes to believe in Kate and Jed&#x27;s feelings for each other. But Molly is still dubious, showing Jed&#x27;s criminal record and medical history to Kate, bringing adult dates to their dinner parties and taking her and Janine to Paris so that she will go off Jed. Conversely, this brings Kate and Jed closer together and they plan their wedding.

Molly eventually attempts to prove Jed&#x27;s faithlessness by seducing him, which fails but angers Kate to the extreme. After an argument about how Kate has kept their engagement quiet, Jed is thrown out of Kate&#x27;s house. He is struck and killed by a passing truck; this unexpected tragedy breaks the three women up, as Kate is inconsolable and Janine blames Molly. Depressed at her home, due to her inhability to continue her work as a schoolmistress, Kate is not even capable of using the bathroom without crying and thinking about Jed. Kate reluctantly embarks on a mild romance with local vicar Gerald who has always been in love with her, but when she finally agrees to marry him, she becomes ill at the altar. Molly and Janine take her away, and discover that she is pregnant with Jed&#x27;s child. She decides to have the baby and raise it on her own, while Gerald meets a woman who is actually excited about him. Also, Janine starts going out with Bill (a robbery suspect) and Molly falls for a pediatrician named Eleanor. The three friends reconcile and continue to share their lives and experiences.

==Debated title==

As told by John McKay, the film combines two plot lines which eventually came together. At first he wrote a play which was named &quot;Crush&quot; about an older woman and a younger man.

Later, he met &quot;a set of women doctors who were working too hard to get a date on Friday nights and so would get together instead, drink cheap liquor, eat chocolate, smoke cigarettes and have a competition to decide who was the saddest fucker of the week&quot;. This influenced the original play as it &quot;sprouted more female characters&quot; and became a movie script.

McKay, who both wrote the screenplay and directed the film in 1999, wanted to name the film &quot;The Sad Fuckers Club&quot;, a name which he felt fit the plot line - and which, according to him, Andie MacDowell approved of when offered the role in the film. This, however, was changed after resistance from the financiers and distributors and uneasiness on the part of test audiences, eventually reverting to the original name, &quot;Crush&quot;.

&quot;Crush&quot; met with generally mixed reviews, and has scored an average of 5 out of 10 on review aggregate site, Rotten Tomatoes.

<text>In numerical analysis, the Newton–Cotes formulas, also called the Newton–Cotes quadrature rules or simply Newton–Cotes rules, are a group of formulas for numerical integration (also called &quot;quadrature&quot;) based on evaluating the integrand at equally spaced points. They are named after Isaac Newton and Roger Cotes.

Newton–Cotes formulas can be useful if the value of the integrand at equally spaced points is given. If it is possible to change the points at which the integrand is evaluated, then other methods such as Gaussian quadrature and Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature are probably more suitable.

== Description ==
It is assumed that the value of a function defined on formula_1 is known at formula_2 equally spaced points: formula_3. There are two classes of Newton–Cotes quadrature: they are called &quot;closed&quot; when formula_4 and formula_5, i.e. they use the function values at the interval endpoints, and &quot;open&quot; when formula_6 and formula_7, i.e. they do not use the function values at the endpoints. Newton–Cotes formulas using formula_8 points can be defined (for both classes) as
formula_9
where
*for a closed formula, formula_10, with formula_11,
*for an open formula, formula_12, with formula_13.

The number is called &quot;step size&quot;, formula_14 are called &quot;weights&quot;. The weights can be computed as the integral of Lagrange basis polynomials. They depend only on formula_15 and not on the function . Let formula_16 be the interpolation polynomial in the Lagrange form for the given data points formula_17, then
formula_18

== Instability for high degree ==
A Newton–Cotes formula of any degree can be constructed. However, for large a Newton–Cotes rule can sometimes suffer from catastrophic Runge&#x27;s phenomenon where the error grows exponentially for large . Methods such as Gaussian quadrature and Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature with unequally spaced points (clustered at the &quot;endpoints&quot; of the integration interval) are stable and much more accurate, and are normally preferred to Newton–Cotes. If these methods cannot be used, because the integrand is only given at the fixed equidistributed grid, then Runge&#x27;s phenomenon can be avoided by using a composite rule, as explained below.

Alternatively, stable Newton–Cotes formulas can be constructed using least-squares approximation instead of interpolation. This allows building numerically stable formulas even for high degrees.

== Closed Newton–Cotes formulas ==
This table lists some of the Newton–Cotes formulas of the closed type. For formula_19, let formula_10 where formula_11, and formula_22.


Boole&#x27;s rule is sometimes mistakenly called Bode&#x27;s rule, as a result of the propagation of a typographical error in Abramowitz and Stegun, an early reference book.

The exponent of the step size &quot;h&quot; in the error term gives the rate at which the approximation error decreases. The order of the derivative of &quot;f&quot; in the error term gives the lowest degree of a polynomial which can no longer be integrated exactly (i.e. with error equal to zero) with this rule. The number formula_23 must be taken from the interval , therefore, the error bound is equal to the error term when &lt;math&gt;f(\xi) = \max(f(x)), a&lt;x.

== Open Newton–Cotes formulas ==
This table lists some of the Newton–Cotes formulas of the open type. For formula_19, let formula_12 where formula_13, and formula_22.

== Composite rules ==
For the Newton–Cotes rules to be accurate, the step size needs to be small, which means that the interval of integration formula_1 must be small itself, which is not true most of the time. For this reason, one usually performs numerical integration by splitting formula_1 into smaller subintervals, applying a Newton–Cotes rule on each subinterval, and adding up the results. This is called a &quot;composite rule&quot;. See Numerical integration.

<doc id="236796" wikidata="Q4915125" url="?curid=236796" title="Biomedical model">
<text>The biomedical model of medicine care is the medical model used in most Western healthcare settings, and is built from the perception that a state of health is defined purely in the absence of illness. The biomedical model contrasts with sociological theories of care. 

Forms of the biomedical model have existed since before 400 BC, with Hippocrates advocating for physical etiologies of illness. Despite this, the model did not form the dominant view of health until the nineteenth century during the Scientific Revolution.

Criticism of the model generally surrounds its perception that health is independent of the social environment in which it occurs, and can be defined one way across all populations. The model is also criticised for its view of the health system as socially and politically neutral, and not as a source of social and political power or as embedded into the structure of society.

== Features ==
In their book &quot;Society, Culture and Health: an Introduction to Sociology for Nurses&quot;, health sociologists Karen Willis and Shandell Elmer outline eight &#x27;features&#x27; of the biomedical model&#x27;s approach to illness and health:
* doctrine of specific aetiology: that all illness and disease is attributable to a specific, physiological dysfunction
*body as a machine: that the body is formed of machinery to be fixed by medical doctors
*mind-body distinction: that the mind and body are separate entities that do not interrelate
*reductionism
*narrow definition of health: that a state of health is always the absence of a definable illness
*individualistic: that sources of ill health are always in the individual, and not the environment which health occurs
*treatment versus prevention: that the focus of health is on diagnosis and treatment of illness, not prevention
*treatment imperative: that medicine can &#x27;fix the broken machinery&#x27; of ill-health
*neutral scientific process: that health care systems and agents of health are socially and culturally detached

<doc id="236797" wikidata="Q204442" url="?curid=236797" title="Fernie, British Columbia">
<text>Fernie is a city in the Elk Valley area of the East Kootenay region of southeastern British Columbia, Canada, located on BC Highway 3 on the western approaches to the Crowsnest Pass through the Rocky Mountains. Founded in 1898 and incorporated as the City of Fernie in July 1904, the municipality has a population of over 5,000 with an additional 2,000 outside city limits in communities under the jurisdiction of the Regional District of East Kootenay. A substantial seasonal population swells the city during the winter months.

Fernie lies on the Elk River, along Canada&#x27;s southernmost east-west transportation corridor through the Rockies that crosses the range via the Crowsnest Pass, to the east. As the largest and longest-established community between Cranbrook and Lethbridge, Fernie serves as a minor regional centre, particularly for its fellow Elk Valley communities.

==Geography==

Fernie is the only city-class municipality in Canada that is fully encircled by the Rocky Mountains. The townsite was laid out in the crook of a doglegged glacial valley that today is drained by the Elk River. Three tributaries of the Elk—Coal, Lizard, and Fairy Creeks—rise in its side valleys and join the Elk either within or in close proximity to the townsite.

To the north of the city lie Mount Fernie, Mount Klauer, The Three Sisters and Mount Proctor. To the northeast is Mount Hosmer, to the east is Fernie Ridge, to the southeast is Morrissey Ridge and to the southwest are the various peaks of the Lizard Range. Fernie gives the name to the Jurassic-Age Fernie Formation. The Lizard Range is home to Fernie Alpine Resort, one of the largest ski resorts in Canada, and Island Lake Catskiing, a resort.

==History==

While the slopes of the mountains are the present focus of economic activity, until comparatively recently residents of the area were more interested in the mountains&#x27; innards. The vast Crowsnest Coal Field lies just to the east of the city, and Fernie owes its origins to nineteenth-century prospector William Fernie, who established the coal industry that continues to exist to this day. Acting on pioneer Michael Phillips&#x27; twin discoveries of coal and the Crowsnest Pass a few years earlier, Fernie founded the Crows Nest Pass Coal Company in 1897 and established a temporary encampment near Coal Creek. The Canadian Pacific Railway arrived in the valley the following year, and a townsite emerged parallel to the railway line slightly north of the initial encampment, or &quot;Old Town.&quot;

On May 23, 1902, a coal mine explosion killed 109 miners at the Crow&#x27;s Nest Coal Mining Company. The disaster, one of the worst mining accidents in Canadian history, is largely forgotten in Fernie and overlooked by local historians after more than a century. During World War One, an internment camp for prisoners of war was set up at rented premises in Fernie from June 1915 to October 1918.

Underground coal mines were dug away from the townsite in the narrow Coal Creek valley and until 1960 a small satellite community was known as Coal Creek stood adjacent to them. A variety of other mines were sunk into the coal fields in a radius in the following two decades. No mining was ever carried out in Fernie proper; coking of Coal Creek coal was carried out at the townsite, but otherwise, the town developed into an administrative and commercial centre for the burgeoning industry. Forestry played a smaller role in the local economy and a local brewery produced Fernie Beer from Brewery Creek (mountain spring water).

Like most single-industry towns, Fernie endured several boom-and-bust cycles throughout the twentieth century, generally tied to the global price of coal. The mines at Coal Creek closed permanently by 1960 and the focus of mining activity shifted to Michel and Natal about upriver, which sat on a more productive portion of the Crowsnest Coal Field. Kaiser Resources opened immense open-pit mines there in the 1970s to meet new metallurgical coal contracts for the Asian industrial market, predominantly for use in blast furnaces. Fernie would remain an important residential base for mine labour, along with the new communities of Sparwood and Elkford that sprang up much closer to these new mines. Today, Teck Resources operates four open-pit mines, shipping out unit trains (often with more than 100 cars) along the Canadian Pacific Railway through Fernie to the Pacific Coast, where the coal is loaded onto freighters at Roberts Bank Superport in Delta.

=== Flathead Valley avalanches ===
The Flathead Valley avalanches were two avalanches that buried 11 snowmobilers near Fernie on December 28, 2008. The avalanches ultimately claimed the lives of eight of the riders.

==Architectural heritage==
After a disastrous fire levelled much of the downtown core in 1904, the fledgling municipal government passed an ordinance requiring all buildings in the area to be built of &#x27;fireproof&#x27; materials like brick and stone. Consequently, a new city centre rose from the ashes sporting brick buildings along broad avenues that would have looked more at home in a sedate and refined Victorian city than a rough-and-tumble frontier coal town. They were short-lived, however, as a second, larger inferno swept through the city on August 1, 1908. Whipped up by sudden winds, a nearby forest fire burnt its way into a lumber yard on the edge of the community and sparked a Dresden-style firestorm that melted brick and mortar and essentially erased the entire city in an afternoon. There were few casualties however and for a second time, a stately brick downtown core rose from the ashes. Today, these historic buildings, most of which still stand, are a treasured and distinctive feature of the community.

==Sports==
Summer in Fernie is generally far quieter than the winter months, though mountain biking, fly fishing and golf are increasingly important tourist draws.

===Fernie Memorial Arena disaster===
On October 17, 2017, there was an ammonia leak at the Fernie Memorial Arena which killed three workers (two City of Fernie employees and one CIMCO refrigeration employee from Calgary) during the Ghostriders&#x27; regular season. Because of this tragedy, the City of Fernie declared a state of emergency and people had to evacuate the area for days. The &#x27;Riders were relocated because of this to the Elk Valley Leisure Centre in Sparwood, British Columbia during the 2017–18 KIJHL season until the City of Fernie decided what to do. The City of Fernie decided to replace ammonia for a synthetic refrigerant prior to the 2018–19 KIJHL season and moved the team back to the Fernie Memorial Arena.

<doc id="236798" wikidata="Q451667" url="?curid=236798" title="Roger Cotes">
<text>Roger Cotes (10 July 1682 – 5 June 1716) was an English mathematician, known for working closely with Isaac Newton by proofreading the second edition of his famous book, the &quot;Principia&quot;, before publication. He also devised the quadrature formulas known as Newton–Cotes formulas, which originated from Newton&#x27;s research, and made a geometric argument that can be interpreted as a logarithmic version of Euler&#x27;s formula. He was the first Plumian Professor at Cambridge University from 1707 until his death.

==Early life==
Cotes was born in Burbage, Leicestershire. His parents were Robert, the rector of Burbage, and his wife, Grace, &quot;née&quot; Farmer. Roger had an elder brother, Anthony (born 1681), and a younger sister, Susanna (born 1683), both of whom died young. At first Roger attended Leicester School, where his mathematical talent was recognised. His aunt Hannah had married Rev. John Smith, and Smith took on the role of tutor to encourage Roger&#x27;s talent. The Smiths&#x27; son, Robert Smith, became a close associate of Roger Cotes throughout his life. Cotes later studied at St Paul&#x27;s School in London and entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1699. He graduated BA in 1702 and MA in 1706.

==Astronomy==
Roger Cotes&#x27;s contributions to modern computational methods lie heavily in the fields of astronomy and mathematics. Cotes began his educational career with a focus on astronomy. He became a fellow of Trinity College in 1707, and at age 26 he became the first Plumian Professor of Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy. On his appointment to professor, he opened a subscription list in an effort to provide an observatory for Trinity. Unfortunately, the observatory was still unfinished when Cotes died, and was demolished in 1797.

In correspondence with Isaac Newton, Cotes designed a heliostat telescope with a mirror revolving by clockwork. He recomputed the solar and planetary tables of Giovanni Domenico Cassini and John Flamsteed, and he intended to create tables of the moon&#x27;s motion, based on Newtonian principles. Finally, in 1707 he formed a school of physical sciences at Trinity in partnership with William Whiston.

==The &quot;Principia&quot;==
From 1709 to 1713, Cotes became heavily involved with the second edition of Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia&quot;, a book that explained Newton&#x27;s theory of universal gravitation. The first edition of &quot;Principia&quot; had only a few copies printed and was in need of revision to include Newton&#x27;s works and principles of lunar and planetary theory. Newton at first had a casual approach to the revision, since he had all but given up scientific work. However, through the vigorous passion displayed by Cotes, Newton&#x27;s scientific hunger was once again reignited. The two spent nearly three and half years collaborating on the work, in which they fully deduce, from Newton&#x27;s laws of motion, the theory of the moon, the equinoxes, and the orbits of comets. Only 750 copies of the second edition were printed although pirated copies from Amsterdam were also distributed to meet the demand for the work. As a reward to Cotes, he was given a share of the profits and 12 copies of his own. Cotes&#x27;s original contribution to the work was a preface which supported the scientific superiority of Newton&#x27;s principles over the then popular vortex theory of gravity advocated by René Descartes. Cotes concluded that the Newton&#x27;s law of gravitation was confirmed by observation of celestial phenomena that were inconsistent with the vortex theory.

==Mathematics==
Cotes&#x27;s major original work was in mathematics, especially in the fields of integral calculus, logarithms, and numerical analysis. He published only one scientific paper in his lifetime, titled &quot;Logometria&quot;, in which he successfully constructs the logarithmic spiral. After his death, many of Cotes&#x27;s mathematical papers were edited by his cousin Robert Smith and published in a book, &quot;Harmonia mensurarum&quot;. Cotes&#x27;s additional works were later published in Thomas Simpson&#x27;s &quot;The Doctrine and Application of Fluxions&quot;. Although Cotes&#x27;s style was somewhat obscure, his systematic approach to integration and mathematical theory was highly regarded by his peers. Cotes discovered an important theorem on the &quot;n&quot;-th roots of unity, foresaw the method of least squares, and discovered a method for integrating rational fractions with binomial denominators. He was also praised for his efforts in numerical methods, especially in interpolation methods and his table construction techniques. He was regarded as one of the few British mathematicians capable of following the powerful work of Sir Isaac Newton.

==Death and assessment==
Cotes died from a violent fever in Cambridge in 1716 at the early age of 33. Isaac Newton remarked, &quot;If he had lived we would have known something.&quot;

<text>Porthos, Baron du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds is a fictional character in the novels &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1844), &quot;Twenty Years After&quot; (1845), and &quot;The Vicomte de Bragelonne&quot; (1847–1850) by Alexandre Dumas, père. He and the other two musketeers, Athos and Aramis, are friends of the novel&#x27;s protagonist, d&#x27;Artagnan. Porthos is a highly fictionalized version of the historical musketeer Isaac de Porthau.

==Name==
In &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;, his family name is du Vallon. In &quot;Twenty Years After&quot;, having made a financially advantageous marriage, his surname is du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds. He eventually earns the title of Baron. His real first name is never given; &quot;Porthos&quot; is a nom de guerre, assumed upon joining the Musketeers.

==Personality==
Porthos, honest and slightly gullible, is the extrovert of the group, enjoying wine, women and song. Though he is often seen as the comic relief, he is also extremely dedicated and loyal toward his friends and fellow Musketeers and stands out for his physical strength and size. His eating abilities even impress King Louis XIV during a banquet at Fontainebleau. As the story advances, he looks more and more like a giant, and his death is that of a titan.

At the time of &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (ca. 1627), he apparently has few lands or other resources to draw from. He is finally able to extract sufficient funds from an elderly lawyer&#x27;s somewhat younger wife (whom he was romancing and later married) to equip himself for the Siege of La Rochelle.

The fictional Porthos is very loosely based on the historical musketeer Isaac de Porthau.

<text>In statistics, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a class of algorithms used to draw samples from a probability distribution. Given a probability distribution, one can construct a Markov chain whose elements&#x27; distribution approximates it – that is, the Markov chain&#x27;s equilibrium distribution matches the target distribution. The more steps that are included, the more closely the distribution of the sample matches the actual desired distribution.

Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are used to study probability distributions that are too complex or too highly dimensional to study with analytic techniques alone. Various algorithms exist for constructing such Markov chains, including the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm.

== Applications ==
MCMC methods are primarily used for calculating numerical approximations of multi-dimensional integrals, for example in Bayesian statistics, computational physics, computational biology and computational linguistics.

In Bayesian statistics, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are typically used to calculate moments and credible intervals of posterior probability distributions. The use of MCMC methods makes it possible to compute large hierarchical models that require integrations over hundreds to thousands of unknown parameters.

In rare event sampling, they are also used for generating samples that gradually populate the rare failure region.

== General explanation ==
Markov chain Monte Carlo methods create samples from a continuous random variable, with probability density proportional to a known function. These samples can be used to evaluate an integral over that variable, as its expected value or variance.

Practically, an ensemble of chains is generally developed, starting from a set of points arbitrarily chosen and sufficiently distant from each other. These chains are stochastic processes of &quot;walkers&quot; which move around randomly according to an algorithm that looks for places with a reasonably high contribution to the integral to move into next, assigning them higher probabilities.

Random walk Monte Carlo methods are a kind of random simulation or Monte Carlo method. However, whereas the random samples of the integrand used in a conventional Monte Carlo integration are statistically independent, those used in MCMC are autocorrelated. Correlations of samples introduces the need to use the Markov chain central limit theorem when estimating the error of mean values.

These algorithms create Markov chains such that they have an equilibrium distribution which is proportional to the function given.

==Reducing correlation==
While MCMC methods were created to address multi-dimensional problems better than generic Monte Carlo algorithms, when the number of dimensions rises they too tend to suffer the curse of dimensionality: regions of higher probability tend to stretch and get lost in an increasing volume of space that contributes little to the integral. One way to address this problem could be shortening the steps of the walker, so that it does not continuously try to exit the highest probability region, though this way the process would be highly autocorrelated and expensive (i.e. many steps would be required for an accurate result). More sophisticated methods such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and the Wang and Landau algorithm use various ways of reducing this autocorrelation, while managing to keep the process in the regions that give a higher contribution to the integral. These algorithms usually rely on a more complicated theory and are harder to implement, but they usually converge faster.

== Examples ==

=== Random walk ===
* Metropolis–Hastings algorithm: This method generates a Markov chain using a proposal density for new steps and a method for rejecting some of the proposed moves. It is actually a general framework which includes as special cases the very first and simpler MCMC (Metropolis algorithm) and many more recent alternatives listed below.
**Gibbs sampling: When target distribution is multi-dimensional, Gibbs sampling algorithm updates each coordinate from its full conditional distribution given other coordinates. Gibbs sampling can be viewed as a special case of Metropolis–Hastings algorithm with acceptance rate uniformly equal to 1. When drawing from the full conditional distributions is not straightforward other samplers-within-Gibbs are used (e.g., see ). Gibbs sampling is popular partly because it does not require any &#x27;tuning&#x27;. Algorithm structure of the Gibbs sampling highly resembles that of the coordinate ascent variational inference in that both algorithms utilize the full-conditional distributions in the updating procedure.
** Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm and other methods that rely on the gradient (and possibly second derivative) of the log target density to propose steps that are more likely to be in the direction of higher probability density.
** Hamiltonian (or hybrid) Monte Carlo (HMC): Tries to avoid random walk behaviour by introducing an auxiliary momentum vector and implementing Hamiltonian dynamics, so the potential energy function is the target density. The momentum samples are discarded after sampling. The result of hybrid Monte Carlo is that proposals move across the sample space in larger steps; they are therefore less correlated and converge to the target distribution more rapidly.
**Pseudo-marginal Metropolis–Hastings: This method replaces the evaluation of the density of the target distribution with an unbiased estimate and is useful when the target density is not available analytically, e.g. latent variable models.
* Slice sampling: This method depends on the principle that one can sample from a distribution by sampling uniformly from the region under the plot of its density function. It alternates uniform sampling in the vertical direction with uniform sampling from the horizontal &#x27;slice&#x27; defined by the current vertical position.
* Multiple-try Metropolis: This method is a variation of the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm that allows multiple trials at each point. By making it possible to take larger steps at each iteration, it helps address the curse of dimensionality.
* Reversible-jump: This method is a variant of the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm that allows proposals that change the dimensionality of the space. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods that change dimensionality have long been used in statistical physics applications, where for some problems a distribution that is a grand canonical ensemble is used (e.g., when the number of molecules in a box is variable). But the reversible-jump variant is useful when doing Markov chain Monte Carlo or Gibbs sampling over nonparametric Bayesian models such as those involving the Dirichlet process or Chinese restaurant process, where the number of mixing components/clusters/etc. is automatically inferred from the data.

=== Interacting particle methods ===
Interacting MCMC methodologies are a class of mean-field particle methods for obtaining random samples from a sequence of probability distributions with an increasing level of sampling complexity. These probabilistic models include path space state models with increasing time horizon, posterior distributions w.r.t. sequence of partial observations, increasing constraint level sets for conditional distributions, decreasing temperature schedules associated with some Boltzmann–Gibbs distributions, and many others. In principle, any Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler can be turned into an interacting Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler. These interacting Markov chain Monte Carlo samplers can be interpreted as a way to run in parallel a sequence of Markov chain Monte Carlo samplers. For instance, interacting simulated annealing algorithms are based on independent Metropolis–Hastings moves interacting sequentially with a selection-resampling type mechanism. In contrast to traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, the precision parameter of this class of interacting Markov chain Monte Carlo samplers is &quot;only&quot; related to the number of interacting Markov chain Monte Carlo samplers. These advanced particle methodologies belong to the class of Feynman–Kac particle models, also called Sequential Monte Carlo or particle filter methods in Bayesian inference and signal processing communities. Interacting Markov chain Monte Carlo methods can also be interpreted as a mutation-selection genetic particle algorithm with Markov chain Monte Carlo mutations.

=== Quasi-Monte Carlo ===

The quasi-Monte Carlo method is an analog to the normal Monte Carlo method that uses low-discrepancy sequences instead of random numbers. It yields an integration error that decays faster than that of true random sampling, as quantified by the Koksma–Hlawka inequality. Empirically it allows the reduction of both estimation error and convergence time by an order of magnitude. Markov chain quasi-Monte Carlo methods such as the Array–RQMC method combine randomized quasi–Monte Carlo and Markov chain simulation by simulating formula_1 chains simultaneously in a way that better approximates the true distribution of the chain than with ordinary MCMC. In empirical experiments, the variance of the average of a function of the state sometimes converges at rate formula_2 or even faster, instead of the formula_3 Monte Carlo rate.

== Convergence ==
Usually it is not hard to construct a Markov chain with the desired properties. The more difficult problem is to determine how many steps are needed to converge to the stationary distribution within an acceptable error. A good chain will have rapid mixing: the stationary distribution is reached quickly starting from an arbitrary position. A standard empirical method to assess convergence is to run several independent simulated Markov chains and check that the ratio of inter-chain to intra-chain variances for all the parameters sampled is close to 1.

Typically, Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling can only approximate the target distribution, as there is always some residual effect of the starting position. More sophisticated Markov chain Monte Carlo-based algorithms such as coupling from the past can produce exact samples, at the cost of additional computation and an unbounded (though finite in expectation) running time.

Many random walk Monte Carlo methods move around the equilibrium distribution in relatively small steps, with no tendency for the steps to proceed in the same direction. These methods are easy to implement and analyze, but unfortunately it can take a long time for the walker to explore all of the space. The walker will often double back and cover ground already covered.

Further consideration of convergence is at Markov chain central limit theorem. See for a discussion of the theory related to convergence and stationarity of the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm.

<text>Recall in memory refers to the mental process of retrieving information from the past. Along with encoding and storage, it is one of the three core processes of memory. There are three main types of recall: free recall, cued recall and serial recall. Psychologists test these forms of recall as a way to study the memory processes of humans and animals.
Two main theories of the process of recall are the two-stage theory and the theory of encoding specificity.

==Theories==
===Two-stage theory===
The &quot;two-stage theory&quot; states that the process of recall begins with a search and retrieval process, and then a decision or recognition process where the correct information is chosen from what has been retrieved. In this theory, recognition only involves the latter of these two stages, or processes, and this is thought to account for the superiority of the recognition process over recall. Recognition only involves one process in which error or failure may occur, while recall involves two. However, recall has been found to be superior to recognition in some cases, such as a failure to recognize words that can later be recalled.

Another two stage theory holds that free recall of a list of items begins with the content in working memory and then moves to an associative search.

===Encoding specificity===
The theory of &quot;encoding specificity&quot; finds similarities between the process of recognition and that of recall. The &quot;encoding specificity principle&quot; states that memory utilizes information from the memory trace, or the situation in which it was learned, and from the environment in which it is retrieved. In other words, memory is improved when information available at encoding is also available at retrieval. For example, if one is to learn about a topic and study it in a specific location, but take their exam in a different setting, they would not have had as much of a successful memory recall as if they were in the location that they learned and studied the topic in. Encoding specificity helps to take into account context cues because of its focus on the retrieval environment, and it also accounts for the fact recognition may not always be superior to recall.

==History==
Philosophical questions regarding how people acquire knowledge about their world spurred the study of memory and learning. Recall is a major part of memory so the history of the study of memory in general also provides a history of the study of recall.
In 1885, Hermann Ebbinghaus created nonsense syllables, combinations of letters that do not follow grammatical rules and have no meaning, to test his own memory. He would memorize a list of nonsense syllables and then test his recall of that list over varying time periods. He discovered that memory loss occurred rapidly over the first few hours or days, but showed a more steady, gradual decline over subsequent days, weeks, and months. Furthermore, Ebbinghaus discovered that multiple learning, over-learning, and spacing study times increased retention of information. Ebbinghaus&#x27; research influenced much of the research conducted on memory and recall throughout the twentieth century.

Frederic Bartlett was a prominent researcher in the field of memory during the mid-twentieth century. He was a British experimental psychologist who focused on the mistakes people made when recalling new information. One of his well-known works was &quot;Remembering: A Study in Experimental and Social Psychology&quot;, which he published in 1932. He is well known for his use of North American Native folk tales, including &quot;The War of the Ghosts&quot;. He would provide participants in his study with an excerpt from a story and then asked them to recall it as accurately as they could. Retention intervals would vary from directly after reading the story to days later. Bartlett found that people try to understand the overall meaning of the story. Since the folk tale included supernatural elements, people would rationalize them to make them fit better with their own culture. Ultimately, Bartlett argued that the mistakes that the participants made could be attributed to &quot;schematic intrusions&quot; - current knowledge interfering with recall.

In the 1950s there was a change in the overall study of memory that has come to be known as the cognitive revolution. This included new theories on how to view memory, often likening it to a computer processing model. Two important books influenced the revolution: &quot;Plans and Structures of Behavior&quot; by George Miller, Eugene Galanter, and Karl H. Pribram in 1960 and &quot;Cognitive Psychology&quot; by Ulric Neisser in 1967. Both provided arguments for an information-processing view of the human mind. Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon constructed computer programs that simulated the thought processes people go through when solving different kinds of problems.

In the 1960s, interest in short-term memory (STM) increased. Before the 1960s, there was very little research that studied the workings of short-term memory and rapid memory loss. Lloyd and Margaret Peterson observed that when people are given a short list of words or letters and then are distracted and occupied with another task for few seconds, their memory for the list is greatly decreased.
Atkinson and Shiffrin (1973) created the short-term memory model, which became the popular model for studying short-term memory.

The next major development in the study of memory recall was Endel Tulving&#x27;s proposition of two kinds of memory: episodic and semantic. Tulving described episodic memory as a memory about a specific event that occurred at a particular time and place, for example what you got for your 10th birthday. Semantic memories are abstract words, concepts, and rules stored in long-term memory. Furthermore, Endel Tulving devised the encoding specificity principle in 1983, which explains the importance of the relation between the encoding of information and then recalling that information. To explain further, the encoding specificity principle means that a person is more likely to recall information if the recall cues match or are similar to the encoding cues.

The 1960s also saw a development in the study of visual imagery and how it is recalled. This research was led by Allan Paivio, who found that the more image-arousing a word was the more likely it would be recalled in either free recall or paired associates.

There has been a considerable amount of research into the workings of memory, and specifically recall since the 1980s. The previously mentioned research was developed and improved upon, and new research was and still is being conducted.

==Types==
===Free recall===

Free recall describes the process in which a person is given a list of items to remember and then is tested by being asked to recall them in any order. Free recall often displays evidence of primacy and recency effects. Primacy effects are displayed when the person recalls items presented at the beginning of the list earlier and more often. The recency effect is when the person recalls items presented at the end of the list earlier and more often. Free recall often begins with the end of the list and then moves to the beginning and middle of the list.

===Cued recall===
Cued recall is when a person is given a list of items to remember and is then tested with cues to remember material. Researchers have used this procedure to test memory. Participants are given pairs, usually of words, A1-B1, A2-B2...An-Bn (n is the number of pairs in a list) to study. Then the experimenter gives the participant a word to cue the participant to recall the word with which it was originally paired. The word presentation can either be visual or auditory.

There are two basic experimental methods used to conduct cued recall, the study-test method and the anticipation method. In the study-test method participants study a list of word pairs presented individually. Immediately after or after a time delay, participants are tested in the study phase of the experiment on the word pairs just previously studied. One word of each pair is presented in a random order and the participant is asked to recall the item with which it was originally paired. The participant can be tested for either forward recall, Ai is presented as a cue for Bi, or backward recall, Bi is presented as a cue for Ai. In the anticipation method, participants are shown Ai and are asked to anticipate the word paired with it, Bi. If the participant cannot recall the word, the answer is revealed. During an experiment using the anticipation method, the list of words is repeated until a certain percentage of Bi words are recalled.

The learning curve for cued recall increases systematically with the number of trials completed. This result has caused a debate about whether or not learning is all-or-none. One theory is that learning is incremental and that the recall of each word pair is strengthened with repetition. Another theory suggests that learning is all-or-none, that is one learns the word pair in a single trial and memory performance is due to the average learned pairs, some of which are learned on earlier trials and some on later trials. To examine the validity of these theories researchers have performed memory experiments. In one experiment published in 1959, experimental psychologist Irvin Rock and colleague Walter Heimer of the University of Illinois had both a control group and an experimental group learn pairs of words. The control group studied word pairs that were repeated until the participants learned all the word pairs. In the experimental group, the learned pairs remained in the list while unlearned pairs were substituted with recombinations of previous words. Rock believed that associations between two items would be strengthened if learning were incremental even when pairs are not correctly recalled. His hypothesis was that the control group would have a higher correct recall probability than the experimental group. He thought that repetition would increase the strength of the word pair until the strength reaches a threshold needed to produce an overt response. If learning were all or none, then the control group and the experimental group should learn the word pairs at the same rate. Rock found experimentally there was little difference in learning rates between the two groups. However, Rock&#x27;s work did not settle the controversy because in his experiment he rearranged replaced word pairs that could be either easier or harder to learn than the original words in the word- digit pair. In further experiments that addressed the question, there were mixed results. The incremental learning hypothesis is supported by the notion that awhile after Ai-Bi pairs are learned, the recall time to recall Bi decreases with continued learning trails.

Another theory that can be tested using cued recall is symmetry of forward and backward recall. Forward recall is generally assumed to be easier than backward recall, i.e. forward recall is stronger than backward recall. This is generally true for long sequences of word or letters such as the alphabet. In one view, the independent associations hypothesis, the strength of forward and backward recall are hypothesized to be independent of each other. To confirm this hypothesis, Dr. George Wolford tested participants&#x27; forward and backward recall and found that forward and backward recall are independent of each other. The probability of correct forward recall was .47 for word pair associations and the probability of correct backward recall of word pair associations was .25. However, in another view, the associative symmetry hypothesis, the strengths of forward and backward recall are about equal and highly correlated. In S.E Asch from Swarthmore College and S. M Ebenholtz&#x27;s experiment, participants learned pairs of nonsense syllables by anticipation recall. After reaching a certain threshold of learning, the participants were tested by free recall to determine all pairs and single items they could remember. These researchers found that backward association was greatly weaker than forward association. However, when the availability of forward and backward recall were basically the same, there was little difference between forward and backward recall. Some scientists including Asch and Ebenholtz believe in the independent association hypothesis think that the equal strengths of forward and backward recall are compatible with their hypothesis because forward and backward recall could be independent but with equal strengths. However associative symmetry theorists interpreted the data to mean that the results fit their hypothesis.

Another study done using cued recall found that learning occurs during test trials. Mark Carrier and Pashler (1992) found that the group with a study-only phase makes 10% more errors than the group with a test-study phase. In the study-only phase, participants were given Ai-Bi, where Ai was an English word and Bi was a Siberian Eskimo Yupik word. In the test study phase, participants first attempted to recall Bi given Ai as a cue then they were shown Ai-Bi pair together. This result suggests that after participants learn something, testing their memory with mental operations helps later recall. The act of recalling instead of restudying creates new and longer lasting connection between Ai and Bi. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as the testing effect.

Another study showed that when lists are tested immediately after study, the last couple of pairs are remembered best. After a five-second delay, the recall of recently studied words diminishes. However, word pairs at the beginning of a list still show better recall. Moreover, in a longer list, the absolute number of word pairs recalled is greater but in a shorter list of word pairs, the percentage of word pairs recalled is greater.

Sometimes, when recalling word pairs, there is an intrusion. An intrusion is an error that participants make when they attempt to recall a word based on a cue of that word pair. Intrusions tend to have either semantic attributes in common with the correct word not recalled or have been previously studied in another word pair on the current list or a previously studied list or were close in time to the cue item. When two items are similar, an intrusion may occur. Professor Kahana and Marieke Vugt at the University of Pennsylvania examined the effects of face similarity for face-name associations. In the first experiment, they wanted to determine if performance of recall would vary with the number of faces in the study set that were similar to the cue face. Faces were similar if the radius of the faces were within a range. The number of faces within a radius is called a neighborhood density. They found that the recall of a name to face exhibited a lower accuracy and slower reaction time for faces with a greater neighborhood density. The more similarity that two faces have, the greater the probability for interference between the two faces. When cued with face A, name B may be recalled if face A and B are similar, which would signify that an intrusion has occurred. The probability of correct recall came from the number of faces that had other similar faces.

Cues act as guides to what the person is supposed to remember. A cue can be virtually anything that may act as a reminder, e.g. a smell, song, color, place etc. In contrast to free recall, the subject is prompted to remember a certain item on the list or remember the list in a certain order. Cued recall also plays into free recall because when cues are provided to a subject, they will remember items on the list that they did not originally recall without a cue. Tulving explained this phenomenon in his research. When he gave participants associative cues to items that they did not originally recall and that were thought to be lost to memory, the participants were able to recall the item.

===Serial recall===
Serial recall is the ability to recall items or events in the order in which they occurred. The ability of humans to store items in memory and recall them is important to the use of language. Imagine recalling the different parts of a sentence, but in the wrong order. The ability to recall in serial order has been found not only in humans, but in a number of non-human primate species and some non-primates. Imagine mixing up the order of phonemes, or meaningful units of sound, in a word so that &quot;slight&quot; becomes &quot;style.&quot; Serial-order also helps us remember the order of events in our lives, our autobiographical memories. Our memory of our past appears to exist on a continuum on which more recent events are more easily remembered in order.

Serial recall in long-term memory (LTM) differs from serial recall in short-term memory (STM). To store a sequence in LTM, the sequence is repeated over time until it is represented in memory as a whole, rather than as a series of items. In this way, there is no need to remember the relationships between the items and their original positions. In STM, immediate serial recall (ISR) has been thought to result from one of two mechanisms. The first refers to ISR as a result of associations between the items and their positions in a sequence, while the second refers to associations between items. These associations between items are referred to as chaining, and is an unlikely mechanism, according to research. Position-item relationships do not account for recency and primacy effects, or the phonological similarity effect. The Primacy Model moves away from these two assumptions, suggesting that ISR results from a gradient of activation levels where each item has a particular level of activation that corresponds to its position. Research has supported the fact that immediate serial recall performance is much better when the list is homogenous (of the same semantic category) than when they are heterogeneous (of different semantic category). This suggests that semantic representations are beneficial to immediate serial recall performance. Short-term serial recall is also affected by similar-sounding items, as recall is lower (remembered more poorly) than items that do not sound alike. This is true when lists are tested independently (when comparing two separate lists of similar-sounding and not similar-sounding items) as well as when tested using a mixed list. Alan Baddeley first reported such an experiment in which items within a list were either mutually dissimilar or highly similar.

There is evidence indicating that rhythm is highly sensitive to competing motor production. Actions such as paced finger tapping can have an effect on recall as the disruptive impact of paced finger tapping, but lack of consistent effect of paced irrelevant sound, is indicative of motor feedback from the tapping task disrupting rehearsal and storage.

Eight different effects are generally seen in serial recall studies with humans:

; 1. List length effect: Serial recall ability decreases as the length of the list or sequence increases.

; 2. Primacy and recency effects: Primacy effects refer to better recall of items earlier in the sequence, while recency effects refer to better recall of the last few items. Recency effects are seen more with auditory stimuli rather than verbal stimuli as auditory presentation seems to protect the end of lists from output interference.

; 3. Transposition gradients: Transposition gradients refer to the fact that recall tends to be better to recognize what an item is rather than the order of items in a sequence.

; 4. Item confusion errors: When an item is incorrectly recalled, there is a tendency to respond with an item that resembles the original item in that position.

; 5. Repetition errors: These occur during the recall of a sequence when an item from an earlier position in the sequence is given again in another position. This effect is fairly rare in humans.

; 6. Fill-in effects: If an item is recalled incorrectly at an earlier position than its original place, there is a tendency for the next item recalled to be the item that was displaced by this error. For example, if the sequence is &#x27;1234&#x27; and recall began &#x27;124&#x27;, then the next item is likely to be &#x27;3&#x27;.

; 7. Protrusion effects: These occur when an item from a previous list or test is accidentally recalled on a new list or test. This item is likely to be recalled at its position from the original trial.

; 8. Word-length effects: Short words are recalled more accurately than longer words.

==Neuroanatomy==
The anterior cingulate cortex, globus pallidus, thalamus, and cerebellum show higher activation during recall than during recognition which suggests that these components of the cerebello-frontal pathway play a role in recall processes that they do not in recognition. Although recall and recognition are considered separate processes, they are both most likely constitute components of distributed networks of brain regions.


According to neuroimaging data, PET studies on recall and recognition have consistently found increases in regional cerebral blood flow (RCBF) in the following six brain regions: (1) the prefrontal cortex, particularly on the right hemisphere; (2) the hippocampal and parahippocampal regions of the medial temporal lobe; (3) the anterior cingulate cortex; (4) the posterior midline area that includes posterior cingulate, retrosplenial (see retrosplenial region), precuneus, and cuneus regions; (5) the inferior parietal cortex, especially on the right hemisphere; and (6) the cerebellum, particularly on the left.
The specific role of each of the six main regions in episodic retrieval is still unclear, but some ideas have been suggested. The right prefrontal cortex has been related to retrieval attempt; the medial temporal lobes to conscious recollection; the anterior cingulate to response selection; the posterior midline region to imagery; the inferior parietal to awareness of space; and the cerebellum to self-initiated retrieval .
In recent research, a group of subjects was faced with remembering a list of items and then measured when trying to recall said items. The evoked potentials and hemodynamic activity measured during encoding were found to exhibit reliable differences between subsequently recalled and not recalled items. This effect has been termed the subsequent memory effect (SME). This difference in these specific brain regions determines whether or not an item is recalled. A study by Fernandez et al. has shown that the differences that predict recall appear both as a negative deflection in the rhinal cortex of an event-related potential (ERP) 400 ms after stimulus exposure, and as a positive hippocampal ERP beginning 800 ms after stimulus onset. This means that recall only occurs if these two brain regions (rhinal cortex and hippocampus) are activated in synchrony.

==Factors that affect recall==
===Attention===
The effect of attention on memory recall has surprising results. It seems that the only time attention largely affects memory is during the encoding phase. During this phase, performing a parallel task can severely impair retrieval success. It is believed that this phase requires much attention to properly encode the information at hand, and thus a distractor task does not allow proper input and reduces the amount of information learned.

One&#x27;s attention to words is impacted by emotion grasping vocabulary. Negative and positive words are better recalled than neutral words that are spoken. Many different ways that attention is focused on hearing what the speaker has to say are the inflection of the presenter&#x27;s voice in a sad, content, or frustrated sound or in the use of words that are close to the heart. A study was conducted to observe if the use of emotional vocabulary was a key receptor of recall memory. The groups were put into the same lecture halls and given the same speakers, but the results came back to determine that the inflection and word choice recalled by the listeners concluded that emotional words, phrases, and sounds are more memorable than neutral speakers.

Recall memory is linked with instincts and mechanisms. In order to remember how an event happened, to learn from it or avoid an agitator, connections are made with emotions. For instance, if a speaker is very calm and neutral, the effectiveness of encoding memory is very low and listeners get the gist of what the speaker is discussing. On the other hand, if a speaker is shouting and/or using emotionally driven words, listeners tend to remember key phrases and the meaning of the speech. This is full access of the fight or flight mechanism all people have functioning in the brain, but based on what triggers this mechanism will lead to better recall of it. People tend to focus their attention on cues that are loud, very soft, or something unusual. This makes the auditory system pick up the differences in regular speaking and meaningful speech, when something significant is spoken in the discussion people home in on the message at that part of the speech but tend to lose the other part of the discussion. Our brains sense differences in speech and when those differences occur the brain encodes that part of speech into memory and the information can be recalled for future reference.

===Motivation===
Motivation is a factor that encourages a person to perform and succeed at the task at hand. In an experiment done by Roebers, Moga and Schneider (2001), participants were placed in either forced report, free report or free report plus incentive groups. In each group, they found that the amount of correct information recalled did not differ, yet in the group where participants were given an incentive they had higher accuracy results. This means that presenting participants with an encouragement to provide correct information motivates them to be more precise. However, this is only true if the perception is that success is providing correct information. When it is believed that success is the completion of the task rather than the accuracy of that completion, the number of responses is higher, yet its accuracy is lowered. This shows that the results are dependent on how success is defined to the participant. In the referred experiment, the participants that were placed in the forced response group had the lowest overall accuracy; they had no motivation to provide accurate responses and were forced to respond even when they were unsure of the answer. Another study done by Hill RD, Storandt M, and Simeone C tested the impact of memory skills training and external reward on free recall of serial word lists. Effects similar to those reported in the previous study were seen in children—in contrast to older learners.

===Interference===
In the absence of interference, there are two factors at play when recalling a list of items: the recency and the primacy effects. The recency effect occurs when the short-term memory is used to remember the most recent items, and the primacy effect occurs when the long-term memory has encoded the earlier items. The recency effect can be eliminated if there is a period of interference between the input and the output of information extending longer than the holding time of short-term memory (15–30 seconds). This occurs when a person is given subsequent information to recall preceding the recall of the initial information. The primacy effect, however, is not affected by the interference of recall. The elimination of the last few items from memory is due to the displacement of these items from short-term memory, by the distracting task. As they have not been recited and rehearsed, they are not moved into long-term memory and are thus lost. A task as simple as counting backwards can change memory recall; however an empty delay interval has no effect. This is because the person can continue to rehearse the items in their working memory to be remembered without interference. Cohen (1989) found that there is better recall for an action in the presence of interference if that action is physically performed during the encoding phase. It has also been found that recalling some items can interfere and inhibit the recall of other items. Another stream of thought and evidence suggests that the effects of interference on recency and primacy are relative, determined by the ratio rule (retention interval to inter item presentation distractor rate) and they exhibit time-scale invariance.

===Context===
Context-dependency effects on recall are typically interpreted as evidence that the characteristics of the environment are encoded as part of the memory trace and can be used to enhance retrieval of the other information in the trace. In other words, you can recall more when the environments are similar in both the learning and recall phases. Context cues appear to be important in the retrieval of newly learned meaningful information. In a classic study by Godden and Baddeley (1975), using free recall of wordlist demonstrated that deep-sea divers had better recall when there was a match between the learning and recalling environment. Lists learned underwater were recalled best underwater and lists learned on land were recalled best on land.&quot; An academic application would be that students may perform better on exams by studying in silence, because exams are usually done in silence.

===State-dependent memory===
State-dependent retrieval is demonstrated when material learned under one State is best recalled in that same state. A study by Carter and Cassady (1998) showed this effect with antihistamine. In other words, if you study while on hay fever tablets, then you will recall more of what you studied if you test yourself while on antihistamines in comparison to testing yourself while not on antihistamines after having studied on antihistamines.

A study by Block and Ghoneim (2000) found that, relative to a matched group of healthy, non-drug-using controls, heavy marijuana use is associated with small but significant impairments in memory retrieval.cannabis induces loss of internal control and cognitive impairment, especially impairment of attention and memory, for the duration of the intoxication period.

Stimulants, such as cocaine, amphetamines or caffeine are known to improve recall in humans. However, the effect of prolonged use of stimulants on cognitive functioning is very different from the impact on one-time users. Some researchers have found stimulant use to lower recall rates in humans after prolonged usage. The axons, dendrites, and neurons wear out in many cases. Current research illustrates a paradoxical effect. The few exceptions undergo mental hypertrophy. Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) users are found to exhibit difficulties encoding information into long-term memory, display impaired verbal learning, are more easily distracted, and are less efficient at focusing attention on complex tasks. The degree of executive impairment increases with the severity of use, and the impairments are relatively long-lasting. Chronic cocaine users display impaired attention, learning, memory, reaction time and cognitive flexibility. Whether or not stimulants have a positive or negative effect on recall depends on how much is used and for how long.

===Gender===
Consistently, females perform better than males on episodic memory tasks including delayed recall and recognition. However, males and females do not differ on working, immediate and semantic memory tasks. Neuro-psychological observations suggest that, in general, previous injuries cause greater deficits in females than in males. It has been proposed that the gender differences in memory performance reflect underlying differences in the strategies used to process information, rather than anatomical differences. However, gender differences in cerebral asymmetry received support from morphometric studies showing a greater leftward asymmetry in males than in females, meaning that men and women use each side of their brain to a different extent. There is also evidence for a negative recall bias in women, which means females in general are more likely than males to recall their mistakes. In an eyewitness study by Dan Yarmey in 1991, he found that women were significantly more accurate than men in accuracy of recall for weight of suspects.

Studies have tested the difference between what men and women can recall after a presentation. Three speakers were involved, one being female and two being male. Men and women were put into the same lecture hall and had the same speaker talk to them. The results suggested that information presented by the women speaker was more easily recalled by all the members of the study. Researchers believe this to be a significant difference between genders because women&#x27;s voices have better acoustics, ranging from low tones to high tones. Since their voices have this range, semantic encoding is increased for the pitches that stimulate the auditory component of the brain; this resonates better in the ear function. Since pitch ranges from low tones to high tones, it draws people&#x27;s attention to the words attributed with the tone. As the tone changes, words stand out and from these differences memories can be stored. Recall is made easier since the association the brain can make is between words and sounds spoken.

A distinguishing feature is how males and females process information and then recall what was presented to them. Females tend to remember nonverbal cues and associate the meaning of a discussion with gestures. Since males follow verbal cues they react more to the facts and actual words within a discussion to recall what was said, but fluctuations in the speaker&#x27;s voice helps them maintain the memories. Another difference that sets males and females apart is recalling someone&#x27;s voice. They tend to recall information they have read, for instance, lists of objects are better recalled for men than women. The only similarity they have is that when emotional words are used or an emotional tone is produced, males and females tend to recall those changes.

===Food consumption===

There has been much research on whether eating prior to a cognitive recall test can affect cognitive functioning. One example was a study of the effect of breakfast timing on selected cognitive functions of elementary school students. Their results found that children who ate breakfast at school scored notably higher on most of the cognitive tests than did students who ate breakfast at home and also children who did not eat breakfast at all.

In a study of women experiencing Premenstrual Syndrome, they were either given a placebo beverage or a carbohydrate-rich one. The patients were tested at home; their moods, cognitive performance, and food craving were measured before the consumption of the beverage and 30, 90, and 180 minutes after consumption. The results showed that the carbohydrate-rich beverage significantly decreased self-reported depression, anger, confusion, and carbohydrate craving 90 to 180 minutes after consumption. Memory word recognition also improved significantly.

===Physical activity===

Studies have indicated that children who are inactive have poor health, but they also have poor cognitive health also. With low fitness there is a relationship to decreased cognitive functioning; for instance there are different types of cognitive problems like perception, memory, cognitive control, and there is lower academic achievement. Many tests have been conducted to identify what exactly is the reduction when children do not have physical activity. One test selected children to be in two different groups, one group was physically active the other group was not. After a while of monitoring the children the researchers tested the children in learning and recall memory to see what they were retaining and to observe the difference if available of low physical activity versus high physical activity. The results came back indicating that the children without physical activity have a later recall process than the children with physical activity. The learning part of the experiment was equally distributed on both spectrums for each group, but recall memory was the only variable that did not match both of the groups. 
Physical activity has a significant influence on the hippocampus, since this is the part of the brain that is responsible for encoding information into memory. With physical activity having such an impact on the hippocampus this can regulate other parts of the body as well like weight, memory, daily function, and many more processes that are necessary for the body to work. Since physical activity impacts all of these important parts of the brain, this form of exercise keeps the neural networks functioning well. Neural networks allow information to process and pass to the hippocampus in order to retain memory. This lets the brain be more efficient in processing and more memories are stored this way.

===Trauma and brain exposure===

There is barely any recalled memory in cases of fear and trauma exposure, brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, pain, or anxiety. Recall memory is very limited, since the only memory people with these problems have is the flash backs of what happened when the event took place. People can only recall the memory that happened on that day when they hear or see something that brings the memory into existence. They cannot recall how they felt or what they saw, but through images or audio people can recall that tragic event. For example, the day of September 11, 2001, first responders remember the day and what it was like; but the feelings they could not recall. The only way to recall the feelings they had were when sirens of police vehicles, fire trucks, and ambulances drove by their house they feel the exact feelings that were in effect on that day. 
Recall memory is active when a familiar sound triggers a feeling of pain from a past event, but most of the recall is shut out from traumatic event. It is similar to classical conditioning, when a dog hears a bell it begins to react to the noise rather than an exterior variable like food or an electric shock. The use of therapy is constructed for a person with this problem to help avoid the fear associated with sounds or objects, and be able to then recall other pieces of information that happened during the event.

==Phenomena==
The phenomenological account of recall is referred to as metacognition, or &quot;knowing about knowing&quot;. This includes many states of conscious awareness known as feeling-of-knowing states, such as the tip-of-the-tongue state. It has been suggested that metacognition serves a self-regulatory purpose whereby the brain can observe errors in processing and actively devote resources to resolving the problem. It is considered an important aspect of cognition that can aid in the development of successful learning strategies that can also be generalized to other situations.

===Mnemonics and cognitive strategies===
A key technique in improving and helping recall memory is to take advantage of Mnemonic devices and other cognitive strategies. Mnemonic devices are a type of cognitive strategy that enables individuals to memorize and recall new information in an easier fashion, rather than just having to remember a list of information that is not related to one another. An example of mnemonic devices are PEMDAS or Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally; this is a device for arithmetic when solving equations that have parenthesis, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, or subtraction and what order to do each calculation. Words or an acronym can stand for a process that individuals need to recall. The benefits of using these types of strategies to perform tasks are that encoding becomes more organized and it is easier to remember and process information. Also this device reduces the need of intentional resources at the point of retrieval, which means that recall does not need outside sources helping an individual remember what happened yesterday. Cognitive strategies can leverage semantic connections that will allow the brain to process and work more efficiently than just having to process the information as whole parts. By using the strategies the information becomes related to each other and the information sticks. 
Another type of device people use to help their recall memory become efficient is chunking. Chunking is the process of breaking down numbers into smaller units to remember the information or data, this helps recall numbers and math facts. An example of this chunking process is a telephone number; this is chunked with three digits, three digits, then four digits. People read them off as such when reciting a phone number to another person. There has been research done about these techniques and an institution tested two groups of people to see if these types of devices work well for real people, the results came back determining a significant performance difference between the group who did not use cognitive strategies and the group who did. The group using the techniques immediately performed better than the other group and when taking a pre-test and post-test the results indicated that the group using the techniques improved while the other group did not.

The Method of Loci (MOL) refers to an individual visualizing a spatial environment to improve later recall of information. Instead of merely reading a list of items, individuals mentally walk along a path, placing things that subsequently need to be remembered. This elaborate rehearsal provides the opportunity to manipulate information during the encoding process. For example, from the store, you need peanut butter, toothpaste, dog food, and laundry detergent. Instead of repeating the list, imagine yourself eating a peanut butter sandwich, afterwards walking to the bathroom to brush your teeth, then walking by your dog on the way to the laundry room. This improving recall method does not appear to be limited to merely recalling a list of items. Research demonstrated that this cognitive strategy improved student performance on assessments. Participants were divided into two groups, each receiving the same medical lectures, followed by either self-learning or using the Method of Loci. Each group was subsequently given the same assessment on the learned information and the Method of Loci group performed better, as measured by the number of correct responses.

===Tip-of-the-tongue===
A tip-of-the-tongue (TOT) state refers to the perception of a large gap between the identification or knowledge of a specific subject and being able to recall descriptors or names involving said subject. This phenomenon is also referred to as &#x27;presque vu&#x27;, a French term meaning &quot;almost seen&quot;. There are two prevalent perspectives of TOT states: the psycholinguistic perspective and the metacognitive perspective.

Psycholinguistics views TOT states as a failure of retrieval from lexical memory (see Cohort Model) being cued by semantic memory (facts). Since there is an observed increase in the frequency of TOT states with age, there are two mechanisms within psycholinguistics that could account for the TOT phenomenon. The first is the degradation of lexical networks with age, where degrading connections between the priming of knowledge and vocabulary increases difficulty of successfully retrieving a word from memory. The second suggests that the culmination of knowledge, experience, and vocabulary with age results in a similar situation where many connections between a diverse vocabulary and diverse knowledge also increases the difficulty of successful retrieval of a word from memory.

The metacognitive perspective views TOT states simply as the awareness felt when such an event occurs and the perception of the experience involved. Mainly being aware of a TOT state can result in the rapid devotion of cognitive resources to resolving the state and successfully retrieving the word from memory. Such an explanation leaves much to be desired; however, the psycholinguistic perspective and the metacognitive perspective on TOT states are not mutually exclusive and both are used to observe TOT states in a laboratory setting.

An incubation effect can be observed in TOT states, where the passage of time alone can influence the resolution of the state and result in successful recall. Also, the presence of a TOT state is a good predictor that the problem can be resolved correctly, although this has been shown to occur more frequently with older-young-adults than young-adults or seniors. This is evidence for both the metacognitive perspective as well as the psycholinguistic perspective. It demonstrates the devotion of resources to searching memory, a source of cumulative information, for the desired correct information, and it also shows that we are aware of what information we know or do not know. This is why the current debate between the psycholinguistic view of TOTs as retrieval failure and the metacognitive view of TOTs as a tool for learning continues.

Similar phenomena include déjà vu (already seen), jamais vu (never Seen), and déjà entendu (already heard).
These occur rarely and are more prevalent in patients with traumatic head injuries, and brain disorders including epilepsy.

===Involuntary memory retrieval===
Until recently, research on this phenomenon has been relatively rare, with only two types of involuntary memory retrieval identified: involuntary autobiographical memory retrieval, and involuntary semantic memory retrieval. Both of these phenomena can be considered emergent aspects of otherwise normal and quite efficient cognitive processes.
&quot;Involuntary autobiographical memory&quot; (IAM) retrieval occurs spontaneously as the result of sensory cues as well as internal cues, such as thought or intention. These cues influence us in our day-to-day lives by constantly and automatically activating unconscious memories through priming. It has been demonstrated in many studies that our specific goals and intentions will most frequently result in the retrieval of related IAM, while the second most frequent IAM retrievals result from physical cues in the surrounding context. Autobiographical memories that are unrelated to any specific cues, whether internal or external, are the least frequent to occur. It has been suggested that in this case, an error in self-regulation of memory has occurred that results in an unrelated autobiographical memory reaching the conscious mind. These findings are consistent with metacognition as the third type of experience is often identified as the most salient one.

Involuntary semantic memory retrieval (ISM), or &quot;semantic-popping&quot;, occurs in the same fashion as IAM retrieval. However, the elicited memory is devoid of personal grounding and often considered trivial, such as a random word, image, or phrase. ISM retrieval can occur as a result of spreading activation, where words, thoughts, and concepts activate related semantic memories continually. When enough related memories are primed that an interrelated concept, word, thought, or image &quot;pops&quot; into consciousness and you are unaware of the extent of its relatedness within your memory. Spreading activation is thought to build over a period of many hours, days, or even weeks before a random semantic memory &quot;pops&quot;.

===False memories===
False memories result from persistent beliefs, suggestions via authority figures, or statements of false information. Repeated exposure to these stimuli influence the reorganization of a person&#x27;s memory, affecting its details, or implanting vivid false accounts of an event. This is usually accounted for by source-monitoring error, where a person can recall specific facts, but cannot correctly identify the source of that knowledge because of apparent loss of the association between the episodic (specific experience, or source) and semantic (concept-based, or gist) accounts of the stored knowledge. An example of this is cryptomnesia, or inadvertent plagiarism, where one duplicates a work that they have previously encountered believing it to be their original idea. False memories can also be accounted for by the generation effect, which is an observable phenomenon where repeated exposure to a belief, suggestion, or false information is better remembered with each subsequent generation. This can be seen with the misinformation effect, where an eye-witness account of an event can be influenced by a bystander account of the same event, or by suggestion via an authority figure. It is also believed to influence the recovery of repressed shocking or abusive memories in patients under hypnosis, where the recovered memory, although possibly a vivid account, could be entirely false, or have specific details influenced as the result of persistent suggestion by the therapist.

===Focal retrograde amnesia===
Retrograde amnesia is typically the result of physical or psychological trauma which manifests itself as the inability to remember information preceding the traumatic event. It is usually accompanied by some type of anterograde amnesia, or inability to acquire new knowledge. Focal retrograde amnesia (FRA), sometimes known as functional amnesia, refers to the presence of retrograde amnesia while knowledge acquisition remains intact (no anterograde amnesia). Memory for how to use objects and perform skills (implicit memory) may remain intact while specific knowledge of personal events or previously learned facts (explicit memory) become inaccessible or lost. Amnesia can result from a number of different causes, including encephalitis, severe traumatic brain injury, vitamin B1 deficiency as seen in Korsakoff&#x27;s Syndrome, and psychotic episodes, or by witnessing an emotionally traumatic event (Dissociative amnesia). Dysfunction of the temporal and frontal lobes have been observed in many cases of focal retrograde amnesia, whether metabolic or the result of lesions. However, this evidence only appears to correlate with the symptoms of retrograde amnesia as cases have been observed where patients with minor concussions, showing no visible brain damage, develop FRA. It has been suggested that FRA could represent a variety of different disorders, cognitive deficits, or conditions that result in disproportionate loss of explicit memory, hence Disproportionate Retrograde Amnesia.

===The Face Advantage===
The Face Advantage allows information and memories to be recalled easier through the presentation of a person&#x27;s face rather than a person&#x27;s voice. Faces and voices are very similar stimuli that reveal similar information and result in similar processes of memory recall. During face perception, there are three stages of memory recall that include recognition, followed by the remembering of semantic memory and episodic memory, and finally name recall. The Face Advantage is shown through an experiment where participants are presented with faces and voices of unfamiliar faces and recognizable celebrity faces. The stimuli are presented with a between-group design. The participants are asked to say if the face or voice is familiar. If the answer is yes, they are asked to recall semantic and episodic memories and finally the name of the face or voice. It was much easier for those presented with a celebrity&#x27;s face to recall information than for those presented with a voice. The results show that in the second stage of face perception when memories are recalled, information is recalled faster and more accurate after a face is perceived, and slower, less accurate and with less detail after a voice is perceived. A possible explanation is that the connections between face representations and semantic and episodic memory are stronger than that of voices.

==In popular culture==
Memory phenomena are rich sources of storylines and novel situations in popular media. Two phenomena that appear regularly are total recall abilities and amnesia.

===Total recall===
The Argentinean author, Jorge Luis Borges wrote the short story &quot;Funes the Memorious&quot; in 1944. It depicts the life of Ireneo Funes, a fictional character who falls off his horse and experiences a head injury. After this accident, Funes has total recall abilities. He is said to recall an entire day with no mistakes, but this feat of recall takes him an entire day to accomplish. It is said that Borges was ahead of his time in his description of memory processes in this story, as it was not until the 1950s and research on the patient HM that some of what the author describes began to be understood. A more recent instance of total recall in literature is found in 
is in Stieg Larsson&#x27;s books &quot;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&quot;, in which the lead character, Lisbeth Salander remembers anything she reads, indicating she has total recall ability. Another example is in Dan Brown&#x27;s books &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; and &quot;Angels &amp; Demons&quot;, in which the main character, Dr. Robert Langdon, a religious iconography and symbology professor at Harvard University, has almost total recall ability. In &quot;The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime&quot; by Mark Haddon, the main character, Christopher Boone, is a 15-year-old autistic boy with total recall abilities.

Total recall is also popular in television. It can be seen in Season 4 of the television show &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;, in which the character Dr. Spencer Reid claims to have total recall ability. Agent Fox Mulder from the television show &quot;The X-Files&quot; has a photographic memory, a popular term for total recall. Also, the character of hospital resident Lexie Grey on the television show &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; has total recall ability.

===Amnesia===
Amnesia which is the damage or disruption of memory processes, has been a very popular subject in movies since 1915. Although its portrayal is usually inaccurate, there are some exceptions. &quot;Memento&quot; (2000) is said to be inspired by the condition of the famous amnesic patient known as HM. The main character Leonard has anterograde amnesia after a traumatic attack in which his wife dies. He maintains his identity and shows very little retrograde amnesia. He also displays some of the daily memory problems that are experiences by most amnesics, such as forgetting names or where he is going. Another fairly accurate portrayal of memory disturbances is the non-human character Dory in &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; (2003). This fish, like Leonard, shows memory problems faced by most amnesics where she forgets names, has difficulty storing and recalling information, and often forgets what she is doing, or why she is doing something.

Movies tend to show amnesia as a result of head injury from accidents or attacks. The loss of identity and autobiographical memory shown in &quot;Santa Who?&quot; (2000) in which Santa has amnesia that destroys his identity and memory of himself is very unlikely in the real world. This is also portrayed in &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; (2002) and &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; (2004) where the main character forgets he is a trained assassin. Another misrepresentation of the reality of memory loss in the movies can be seen in Clean Slate (1994) and 50 First Dates (2004) where the characters are able to encode memory during the day but lose all memory of that day at night, while sleeping.

Movies often restore affected person&#x27;s memory through a second trauma, or through a kind of cued recall when they revisit familiar places or see familiar objects. The phenomenon of the second trauma can be seen in &quot;Singing in the Dark&quot; (1956) where the affected individual experiences the onset of amnesia because of the trauma of the Holocaust, but memory is restored with a blow to the head. Although neurosurgery is often the cause of amnesia, it is seen as a solution in some movies, including &quot;Deluxe Annie&quot; (1918) and &quot;Rascals&quot; (1938).

Memory erasure is portrayed in &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; (2004) and in the &quot;Men in Black&quot; movies. &quot;Men in Black&quot; features a device to erase the potentially harmful memories of extraterrestrial interactions in members of the general public. &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; describes a process that targets and erases memories of interpersonal relationships the patients would rather forget so that they are no longer able to recall the experience. In &quot;Paycheck&quot; (2003) and &quot;Total Recall&quot; (1990) memory suppression is used to control and the characters are able to overcome the attempts and recall pieces of their memory.

==Consequences==
===Improving subsequent memory===
By repeating (or recalling [?]) an item over and over again, memory can improve. This process is also known as rehearsal.

===Impairing subsequent memory===
Retrieval-induced forgetting is a process by which retrieving an item from long-term memory impairs subsequent recall of related items.

<doc id="236811" wikidata="Q1649854" url="?curid=236811" title="Athos (character)">
<text>Athos, Count de la Fère, is a fictional character in the novels &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1844), &quot;Twenty Years After&quot; (1845) and &quot;The Vicomte de Bragelonne&quot; (1847–1850) by Alexandre Dumas, père. He is a highly fictionalised version of the historical musketeer Armand d&#x27;Athos (1615–1643).

==In the novels==
In &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis are friends of the novel&#x27;s protagonist, d&#x27;Artagnan. Athos has a mysterious past connecting him with the villain of the novel, Milady de Winter. The oldest of the group by some years, Athos is described as noble and handsome but also taciturn and melancholy, drowning his secret sorrows in drink. He is very protective of d&#x27;Artagnan, the youngest, whom he eventually treats as his brother. By the end of the novel, it is revealed that he is the Count de la Fère. He was once married to Milady de Winter and attempted to kill her after discovering that she was a criminal on the run, an event which left him bitter and disillusioned. However, during the course of this novel, he is able to get his revenge on Milady.

In the second novel, &quot;Twenty Years After&quot;, he has retired from the Musketeers and abandoned his nom-de-guerre of Athos. He has fathered an illegitimate son, Raoul, with Marie de Rohan (Aramis&#x27;s former mistress) and then adopted the boy, making him the vicomte de Bragelonne. Fatherhood makes Athos a much happier man, but after launching Raoul into a military career, Athos looks for new causes to occupy his life. He embraces the Fronde and then a doomed mission to rescue Charles I of England. He is uncharacteristically terrified by the appearance of Mordaunt, Milady&#x27;s son, who is attempting to avenge the death of his mother. Athos, despite his reluctance to engage with the son of his ex-wife, ends up forced to slay him in an underwater fight in the English Channel.

In the third novel, &quot;The Vicomte de Bragelonne&quot;, Athos takes a major behind-the-scenes part in historical events, first helping with the restoration of Charles II to the throne of England and then being entrusted with the diplomatic task of arranging the wedding of Henrietta of England and Philippe I, Duke of Orléans. Athos eventually falls out with King Louis XIV of France, who has seduced his son Raoul&#x27;s fiancée and is briefly thrown into the Bastille for voicing his contempt. After being pardoned at d&#x27;Artagnan&#x27;s instigation, Athos withdraws to his home, where he dies of sorrow after Raoul is killed at war.

Athos&#x27;s first name is never told in the novels. However, in Dumas&#x27;s play &quot;The Youth of the Musketeers,&quot; the young Milady, then named Charlotte, calls him &quot;Olivier.&quot;

==Sources==
The fictional Athos is named after the historical musketeer Armand, Seigneur de Sillègue, d&#x27;Athos, et d&#x27;Autevielle (&quot;Lord of Sillègue, Athos, and Autevielle&quot;), better known as Armand d&#x27;Athos, though they have little in common beyond the name. His birthplace is the commune of Athos-Aspis in the Pyrénées-Atlantiques department. The name also resembles Mount Athos; in chapter 13 of &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;, a Bastille guard says, &quot;But that is not a man&#x27;s name; that is the name of a mountain.&quot; His title, Count de la Fère, while invented, is tied to the domains of La Fère which were once owned by Anne of Austria, Queen of France in these novels and in the historical period in which they are set.

<doc id="236817" wikidata="Q1773077" url="?curid=236817" title="Aramis">
<text>René d&#x27;Herblay, alias Aramis, is a fictional character in the novels &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1844), &quot;Twenty Years After&quot; (1845), and &quot;The Vicomte de Bragelonne&quot; (1847–1850) by Alexandre Dumas, père. He and the other two musketeers, Athos and Porthos, are friends of the novels&#x27; protagonist, d&#x27;Artagnan.

The fictional Aramis is loosely based on the historical musketeer Henri d&#x27;Aramitz.

==Personality==
Aramis loves and courts women, which fits well with the opinions of the time regarding Jesuits and abbots. He is portrayed as constantly ambitious and unsatisfied; as a musketeer, he yearns to become an abbé; but as an abbé, he wishes for the life of the soldier. In &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;, it is revealed that he became a musketeer because of a woman and his arrogance; as a young man in training for the priesthood, he had the misfortune to be caught (innocently or not) reading to a young married woman and thrown out of her house. For the next year, he studied fencing with the best swordsman in town to get his revenge. He then challenged the man who had mistreated him to a duel and thanks to his newly learned fencing skills, killed him almost at once. Because duels were forbidden by royal edict and Aramis was a novice, he had to disappear and adopt a very low profile. He enlisted in the Musketeers under the assumed name of &quot;Aramis&quot;. There he met Athos, Porthos and later d&#x27;Artagnan. Together, they worked to protect the king and to keep the queen&#x27;s affair with the Duke of Buckingham from being revealed by Cardinal Richelieu.

Aramis meets with great success, thanks to his Machiavellian plans and his audacity. He sees every victory as a step to climb to even greater power. Eventually, he is named Superior General of the Jesuits, which is precisely what saves his life at the end of &quot;Le Vicomte De Bragelonne&quot;, after he is betrayed by Nicolas Fouquet.

Despite his ruthless personal ambition, Aramis is an extremely loyal friend: in fact, his only mistakes come when he refuses to harm or offend his friends. In &quot;Twenty Years After&quot;, he follows Athos&#x27;s pleas to spare the life of the villain Mordaunt, and in &quot;Le Vicomte De Bragelonne&quot;, he refuses to suppress d&#x27;Artagnan&#x27;s discovery of the truth about Belle-Île-en-Mer. Aramis even tells his friend Porthos the true identity of the Man in the Iron Mask, despite fearing that this will lead Porthos to kill him (Aramis). Friendship is so important to Aramis that, at the end of &quot;Le Vicomte De Bragelonne&quot;, it is strongly implied that he cries - for the first and only time in his life - after causing the death of one of his friends.

==Mistresses==
Aramis&#x27; political intrigues are matched by (and usually connected with) his amorous intrigues, as Dumas casts him in the role of the lover of politically powerful women of his time. In &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; ca. 1627, he is the lover of the Duchesse de Chevreuse, the confidante of the queen. In &quot;Twenty Years After&quot; he is the lover of the Duchesse de Longueville and, it is broadly implied, the father of her son.

==Names==
In contrast to the other musketeers, Aramis is twice referred to by his first name René. This first happens when d&#x27;Artagnan stumbles upon Aramis and his mistress in the chapter &quot;Les Deux Gaspard&quot; of the second book, and again when Bazin is talking about Aramis in the third book. In &quot;Twenty Years After&quot;, Aramis is a Jesuit known as the Abbé d&#x27;Herblay or Chevalier d&#x27;Herblay. In &quot;The Vicomte de Bragelonne&quot; he is the Bishop of Vannes, a title given to him by Nicolas Fouquet, and later becomes the Superior General of the Jesuits. When he comes back from exile, he is a Spanish noble and ambassador known as Duke of Alameda.

<text>Piggyback transportation refers to the transportation of goods where one transportation unit is carried on the back of something else. It is a specialised form of intermodal transportation and combined transport.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Piggyback&quot; is a corruption of &quot;pickaback&quot;, which is likely to be a folk etymology alteration of &quot;pick pack&quot; (1560s), which perhaps is from &quot;pick&quot;, a dialectal variant of the verb &quot;pitch&quot;.

== Examples ==
=== Human locomotion ===

A person carrying someone else on their back is most commonly seen in the modern day in the form of a parent carrying an underage child, either for travelling or for children&#x27;s games. It can involve the carrier crawling on hands and knees with the child straddling over the back like riding a horse, or with the carrier standing upright with the child hugging or cradled behind the back, often with the child&#x27;s arms leaning over the carrier&#x27;s shoulders and legs wrapping around the flanks. 

Piggybacking may also feature in the context of play or sport, and evidence of this dates back to Ancient Greece where games involving piggyback riding were combined with the requirement of catching or throwing a ball. In the modern era, wife carrying competitions, where the female participants ride on the back of their male partners running the race, are popular in some countries.

=== Rail ===

In rail transport, the practice of carrying trailers or semi-trailers in a train atop a flatcar is referred to as &quot;piggybacking&quot;. Early drawings of the Liverpool &amp; Manchester Railway c1830 show road coaches being piggybacked on railway flat wagons.

The rail service provided for trucks which are carried on trains for part of their journey is referred to as a rolling road, or rolling highway. A related transportation method is the rail transport of semi-trailers, without road tractors, sometimes referred to as &quot;trailer on flatcar (TOFC)&quot;. In the United States, TOFC traffic grew from 1% of freight in 1957 to 5% in 1964 and 15% in 1986.

A railway wagon of one track gauge can be carried on a flat wagon (transporter wagon or rollbock) of another gauge. In addition, an entire train of coupled wagons of one gauge can be carried on continuous rails on a train of flat wagons of another gauge. This was achieved by the Commonwealth Railways on the Marree railway line in South Australia between Telford Cut and Port Augusta in the mid-1950s. Japan Railways planned a similar &quot;Train on Train&quot; scheme, but at much higher speeds, to operate from 2016.

=== Trucking ===

For semi trucks the trucks can be stacked 4 deep if it is just a day-cab truck and only 3 deep if it has a sleeper-cab. The trucks drive up a ramp or are lifted into place by a tow hook on the front bumper, from a heavy-duty tow truck or overhead crane. A saddle is placed on the fifth-wheel, that the front axel of the next truck is attached to, which is called decking. The mirrors are folded in on the trucks being hauled for width requirements and safety. For undecking the trucks, a tow truck or overhead crane is used again. It is typically used to transport newly built or purchased trucks.

=== Marine ===
Small ships of all kinds can be piggybacked on larger ships. Examples include lifeboats, landing craft, and minesweepers on motherships, as well as midget submarines on larger submarines, such as those used for the 1942 Japanese submarine attack on Sydney.

=== Air transport ===
The 1930s British Short Mayo Composite, in which a smaller, four-engine floatplane aircraft named Mercury was carried aloft on the back of a larger four-engine flying boat named Maia, enabled the Mercury to achieve a greater range than would have been possible had it taken off under its own power. The American Space Shuttle was carried on top of specially-modified Boeing 747 Shuttle Carrier Aircraft when the shuttle landed at places other than Kennedy Space Center.

=== Space ===
In space transportation systems, a smaller satellite that is carried as a secondary payload on a launch is said to be &quot;piggybacked&quot; on the main launch. It is often the case of small satellites and cubesats, since they can not usually afford accessing space on a dedicated launch and they choose instead to take profit of the remaining payload capacity in a big satellite launch. However, this is usually at the cost of not being able to fly to their desired orbit and having to remain on a similar orbit to that of the big satellite.

=== Military ===
The metal caterpillar treads of a tank wear out quickly when travelling long distances on ordinary roads. Also, tracked vehicles seriously damage the tarmac layer of ordinary roads (unless the caterpillar treads are specially fitted with rubber pads to avoid this). It is therefore necessary to provide tank transporters, which have rubber tires, to the battlefield.

<text>The new Israeli shekel (, ; ; sign: [[Shekel sign|₪]]; ISO code: ILS; unofficial abbreviation: NIS), also known as simply the Israeli shekel (; ), is the currency of Israel and is also used as a legal tender in the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The new shekel is divided into 100 agorot. The new shekel has been in use since 1 January 1986, when it replaced the hyperinflated old shekel at a ratio of 1000:1.

The currency sign for the new shekel is a combination of the first Hebrew letters of the words &quot;shekel&quot; () and &quot;ẖadash&quot; () (new). When the shekel sign is unavailable the abbreviation &quot;NIS&quot; ( and ) is used.

== History ==

The origin of the name &quot;shekel&quot; () is from the ancient Biblical currency by the same name. An early Biblical reference is Abraham being reported to pay &quot;four hundred shekels of silver&quot; to Ephron the Hittite for the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron (). Shekel is any of several ancient units of weight or of currency in ancient Israel, from the Hebrew root ש-ק-ל (š-q-l) meaning &#x27;weigh&#x27; (שָׁקַל šaqal &#x27;to weigh&#x27;, שֶׁקֶל šeqel &#x27;a standard weight&#x27;), common with other Semitic languages like Akkadian (resp. šaqālu and šiqlu) and Aramaic (resp. תְּקַל teqal and תִּקְלָא tiqla). Initially, it may have referred to a weight of barley. In ancient Israel, the shekel was known to be about 180 grains (11 grams or 0.35 troy ounces).

From the formation of the modern State of Israel on 14 May 1948 through 1952 banknotes continued to be issued by the Anglo-Palestine Bank as the Palestine pound which was pegged at £P1 = £1 sterling. In 1952, the &quot;Anglo-Palestine Bank&quot; changed its name to &quot;Bank Leumi Le-Yisrael&quot; (National Bank of Israel) and the currency name became the Israeli pound.

=== Israeli pound (1952–1980) ===

The Israeli pound (, &quot;lira yisraelit&quot;) was the currency of the State of Israel from June 1952 until it was replaced with the shekel on 24 February 1980. From 1955, after the Bank of Israel was established and took over the duty of issuing banknotes, only the Hebrew name was used, along with the symbol &quot;IL&quot;. The pegging to sterling was abandoned on 1 January 1954, and in 1960, the sub-division of the Israeli pound was changed from 1,000 prutot to 100 agorot.

Because &quot;lira&quot; () was a loanword from Latin, a debate emerged in the 1960s over the name of the Israeli currency due to its non-Hebrew origins. This resulted in a law ordering the Minister of Finance to change the name from &quot;lira&quot; to the Hebrew name &quot;shekel&quot; (). The law allowed the minister to decide on the date for the change. The law came into effect in February 1980, when the Israeli government introduced the &#x27;Israeli shekel&#x27; (now called old Israeli shekel), at a rate of IL10 = IS 1.

=== Shekel (1980–1985) === 

The original shekel, now known as the &quot;old shekel&quot;, was the currency of the State of Israel between 24 February 1980 and 31 December 1985. Both it and its predecessor, the Israeli pound, experienced frequent devaluations against foreign currencies during the 1960s and 1970s. This trend culminated in the old shekel experiencing hyperinflation in the early 1980s. After inflation was contained as a result of the 1985 Economic Stabilization Plan, the new shekel was introduced, replacing the old shekel on 1 January 1986 at a rate of to 

=== New shekel (1985–present) ===

Since the economic crisis of the 1980s and the subsequent introduction of the new shekel in 1985, the Bank of Israel and the government of Israel have maintained much more careful and conservative fiscal and monetary policies, and have gradually introduced various market-based economic reforms. In addition, the signing of free trade agreements helped the Israeli economy become more competitive, while heavy investment in its industrial and scientific base allowed the country to take advantage of opportunities associated with the rise of the global knowledge economy, thus greatly increasing exports and opening new markets for its products and services. As a result of these factors, inflation has been relatively low and the country now maintains a positive balance of payments, with a current account surplus equivalent to about 3% of its GDP in 2010. Consequently, its currency has strengthened though less so than an exceptional rise in the Euro and Swiss Franc, rising approximately 20% in value relative to the US dollar from 2001 to 2011, contrasting to weakening in prior decades.

Since 1 January 2003, the new shekel has been a freely convertible currency. Since 7 May 2006, new shekel derivative trading has also been available on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. This makes the new shekel one of only twenty or so world currencies for which there are widely available currency futures contracts in the foreign exchange market. It is also a currency that can be exchanged by consumers in many parts of the world. On 26 May 2008, CLS Bank International announced that it would settle payment instructions in new shekels, making the currency fully convertible.

== Coins ==
In 1985, coins in denominations of 1 agora, 5 agorot, 10 agorot, ₪, and ₪1 were introduced. In 1990, ₪5 coins were introduced, followed by ₪10 coins in 1995. Production of 1 agora pieces ceased in 1990, and they were removed from circulation on 1 April 1991. A ₪2 coin was introduced on 9 December 2007. The 5 agorot coin, last minted in 2007, was removed from circulation on 1 January 2008.

In April 2011, it was reported that new coins would be minted that would use less metal and thus lower costs. Counterfeiting would also be harder. The Bank of Israel is considering dropping the word &quot;new&quot; on the planned coins series. If approved, this would be the first replacement of all coins since the introduction of the new shekel coins in September 1985. The coins are minted by the Korea Minting and Security Printing Corporation (KOMSCO).

In 2022, the Bank of Israel announced a new series of coins featuring updated inscriptions for its coins, with &quot;new shekels&quot; replacing &quot;new sheqalim&quot;. The 5 and 10 new shekel coins will be the first to feature the new inscriptions, and the 10 agorot and new shekel coins will feature its unit names rendered in Arabic.
* Note that all dates on Israeli coins are given in the Hebrew calendar and are written in Hebrew numerals.

== Banknotes ==

=== Series A (1985–1999)===
Beginning on 4 September 1985. banknotes are introduced in denominations of ₪10, and ₪50. An note followed on 8 May 1986 and the note issued on 19 August 1986. On 2 April 1988, the note issued and the note issued on 16 February 1992 completing the family. The ₪5 and ₪10 notes used the same basic designs as the earlier 5000, and notes but with the denominations altered.

The ₪5 and ₪10 notes were later replaced by coins. A number of these coins, in their first minting, had the images of the individuals on the notes engraved on them.

=== Series B (1999–2017) ===
The Second series of bank notes was released in 1999, replacing the first series by 2005. A plan to issue a banknote, carrying the portrait of Yitzhak Rabin, was announced shortly after Rabin&#x27;s assassination in 1995. However, due to low inflation rates, there was no need for such a banknote and it was never issued.


=== Series C (2014–present) ===
The committee proposed that the new series would bear the portraits of prominent Hebrew poets, among them Rachel Bluwstein, Shaul Tchernichovsky, Leah Goldberg and Nathan Alterman. In December 2010, it was announced that the series would feature portraits of Menachem Begin, Yitzhak Rabin, Rachel, and Shmuel Yosef Agnon. When Begin&#x27;s family opposed the decision, the committee&#x27;s original proposal was readopted.

On 14 November 2012, the Bank of Israel announced that the new series of banknotes is in the final stages of design. The first of the new banknotes to begin circulation was in the ₪50 denomination on 16 September 2014, followed by the ₪200 note on 23 December 2015. The final two denominations, ₪20 and ₪100, were issued on 23 November 2017, completing the &quot;Series C&quot; banknote series.

With the issuing of the third series, the Bank of Israel has adopted the standard English spelling of &quot;shekel&quot; and plural &quot;shekels&quot; for its currency. Previously, the Bank had formally used the Hebrew transcriptions of &quot;sheqel&quot; and &quot;sheqalim&quot; (from ). The new notes also used the Arabic &quot;(šaykal)&quot; rather than &quot;(šayqal)&quot;, which had been used on all banknotes previously.

The banknotes are printed by Orell Füssli Security Printing of Switzerland.

<doc id="236826" wikidata="Q1054437" url="?curid=236826" title="Yamata no Orochi">
<text>, or simply , is a legendary eight-headed and eight-tailed Japanese dragon/serpent.

==Mythology==
Yamata no Orochi legends are originally recorded in two ancient texts about Japanese mythology and history. The 712 AD transcribes this dragon name as and the 720 AD writes it as . In both versions of the Orochi myth, the Shinto storm god Susanoo (or &quot;Susa-no-O&quot;) is expelled from Heaven for tricking his sister Amaterasu, the sun goddess.
After expulsion from Heaven, Susanoo encounters two near the head of the , now called the , in Izumo Province. They are weeping because they were forced to give the Orochi one of their daughters every year for seven years, and now they must sacrifice their eighth, , who Susanoo transforms into a for safekeeping. The tells the following version:

The also describes Yamata no Orochi: &quot;It had an eight-forked head and an eight-forked tail; its eyes were red, like the winter-cherry; and on its back firs and cypresses were growing. As it crawled it extended over a space of eight hills and eight valleys.&quot; The botanical names used to describe this Orochi are or (winter cherry or Japanese lantern, &quot;Physalis alkekengi&quot;), (club moss, &quot;Lycopodiopsida&quot;), (Japanese cypress, &quot;Chamaecyparis obtusa&quot;), and (Japanese cedar, &quot;Cryptomeria&quot;).

The legendary sword , which came from the tail of Yamata no Orochi, along with the mirror and jewel, became the three sacred Imperial Regalia of Japan.

==Etymology==

The Japanese name derives from Old Japanese with a regular from shift, but its etymology is enigmatic. Besides this ancient reading, the kanji, , are commonly pronounced , &quot;big snake; large serpent&quot;.

Carr notes that Japanese scholars have proposed &quot;more than a dozen&quot; &lt; etymologies, while Western linguists have suggested loanwords from Austronesian, Tungusic, and Indo-European languages. The most feasible native etymological proposals are Japanese from , (which is where Susanoo discovered the sacred sword), , or ; and , meaning &quot;god; spirit&quot;, cognate with the river-dragon. Benedict originally proposed &quot;large snake&quot; was suffixed from Proto-Austro-Japanese *&quot;(w)oröt-i&quot; acquired from Austronesian , &quot;snake; worm&quot;; which he later modified to from . Miller criticized Benedict for overlooking Old Japanese &quot; &#x27;tail&#x27; + suffix – as well as an obvious Tungus etymology, [Proto-Tungus] *&quot;xürgü-či&quot;, &#x27;the tailed one&#x27;&quot;, and notes &quot;this apparently well-traveled has now turned up in the speculation of the [Indo-European] folklorists.&quot; Littleton&#x27;s hypothesis involves the 3-headed monster Trisiras or Viśvarūpa, which has a mythological parallel because Indra killed it after giving it soma, wine, and food, but lacks a phonological connection.

==Mythological parallels==
Polycephalic or multi-headed animals are rare in biology, but commonly feature in mythology and heraldry. Multi-headed dragons, like the eight-headed Yamata no Orochi and three-headed Trisiras above, are a common motif in comparative mythology. For instance, multi-headed dragons in Greek mythology include the 9-headed Lernaean Hydra and the 100-headed Ladon, both slain by Heracles.

Two other Japanese examples derive from Buddhist importations of Indian dragon myths. Benzaiten, the Japanese form of Saraswati, supposedly killed a five-headed dragon at Enoshima in 552. Kuzuryū (, &quot;nine-headed dragon&quot;), deriving from the nagarajas (snake-kings) Vasuki and Shesha, is worshipped at Togakushi Shrine in Nagano Prefecture. Compare the Nine-headed Bird () in Chinese mythology.

Comparing folklore about polycephalic dragons and serpents, eight-headed creatures are less common than seven- or nine-headed ones. Among Japanese numerals, or () can mean &quot;many; varied&quot; (e.g., , &quot;greengrocer; jack-of-all-trades&quot;). De Visser says the number 8 is &quot;stereotypical&quot; in legends about kings or gods riding dragons or having their carriages drawn by them. The slaying of the dragon is said to be similar to the legends of Cambodia, India, Persia, Western Asia, East Africa and the Mediterranean area. Smith identifies the mythic seven- or eight-headed dragons with the seven-spiked Pteria shell or eight-tentacled octopus.

The myth of a storm god fighting a sea serpent is itself a popular mythic trope potentially originating with the Proto-Indo-European religion and later transmitted into the religions of the ancient Near East most likely initially through interaction with Hittite speaking peoples into Syria and the Fertile Crescent. This motif, known as (German for &quot;struggle against chaos&quot;), represents the clash between order and chaos. Often as these myths evolve from their source, the role of the storm god (often the head of a pantheon) is adopted by culture heroes or a personage symbolizing royalty. In many examples, the serpent god is often seen as multi-headed or multi-tailed.

<text>A shekel or sheqel (; , , plural , ) is an ancient Mesopotamian coin, usually of silver. A shekel was first a unit of weight—very roughly 11 grams (0.35 ozt)—and became currency in ancient Tyre, Carthage and Hasmonean Judea.

==Name==
The word is based on the triliteral Proto-Semitic root , cognate to the Akkadian or , a unit of weight equivalent to the Sumerian . Use of the word was first attested in under the reign of Naram-Sin of Akkad, and later in in the Code of Hammurabi. The Hebrew reflex of the root is found in the Hebrew words for &quot;to weigh&quot; (), &quot;weight&quot; () and &quot;consideration&quot; (). It is cognate to the Aramaic root and the Arabic root (ث ق ل, in words such as &quot;weight&quot;, &quot;heavy&quot; or , a unit of weight). The famous writing on the wall in the Book of Daniel includes a cryptic use of the word in Aramaic: &quot;&quot;.

Shekel came into the English language via the Hebrew Bible, where it is first used in Genesis 23.

The term &quot;shekel&quot; has been used for a unit of weight, around 9.6 or 9.8 grams (0.31 or 0.32 ozt), used in Bronze Age Europe for balance weights and fragments of bronze that may have served as money.

==History==
The earliest shekels were a unit of weight, used as other units such as grams and troy ounces for trading before the advent of coins. The shekel was common among western Semitic speakers. Moabites, Edomites, and Phoenicians used the shekel, although proper coinage developed very late. Carthaginian coinage was based on the shekel and may have preceded its home town of Tyre in issuing proper coins.

Coins were used and may have been invented by the early Anatolian traders who stamped their marks to avoid weighing each time used. Herodotus states that the first coinage was issued by Croesus, King of Lydia, spreading to the golden Daric (worth 20 or shekel), issued by the Achaemenid Empire and the silver Athenian obol and drachma. Early coins were money stamped with an official seal to certify their weight. Silver ingots, some of them with markings, were issued. Later authorities decided who designed coins.

As with many ancient units, the shekel had a variety of values depending on the era, government and region; weights between 7 and 17 grams and values of 11, 14, and 17 grams are common. A two-shekel weight recently recovered near the temple area in Jerusalem and dated to the period of the First Temple weighs 23 grams, giving a weight of 11.5 grams per shekel in Israel during the monarchy. When used to pay labourers, recorded wages in the ancient world range widely. The Code of Hammurabi (circa 1800 BC) sets the value of unskilled labour at approximately ten shekels per year of work, confirmed in Israelite law by comparing with . Later, records within the Achaemenid Empire (539–333 BC) give ranges from a minimum of two shekels per month for unskilled labour, to as high as seven to ten shekels per month in some records. A subsistence wage for an urban household during the Persian period would have required at least 22 shekels of income per year.

===Israelites===
 notes that the measures of the ingredients for the holy anointing oil were to be calculated using the &quot;Shekel of the Sanctuary&quot; (see also , and similarly at for payment for the redemption of 273 first-born males and at for the offerings of the leaders of the tribes of Israel), suggesting that there were other common measures of a shekel in use, or at least that the Temple authorities defined a standard for the shekel to be used for Temple purposes.

According to Levitical law, whenever a census of the Israelites was to be conducted, every person that was counted was required to pay the &quot;half-shekel&quot; for his atonement ().

The Aramaic , similar to the Hebrew , used during the feast of Belshazzar according to the Book of Daniel and defined as weighed, shares a common root with the word shekel and may even additionally attest to its original usage as a weight.

===Second Temple period half-Shekel Temple tax===

During the Second Temple period, it was customary among Jews to annually offer the &quot;half-Shekel&quot; into the Temple treasury, for the upkeep and maintenance of the Temple precincts, as also used in purchasing public animal offerings. This practice not only applied to Jews living in the Land of Israel, but also to Jews living outside the Land of Israel. Archaeological excavations conducted at Horvat &#x27;Ethri in Israel from 1999 to 2001 by Boaz Zissu and Amir Ganor of the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) have yielded important finds, the most-prized of which being a &quot;half-Shekel&quot; coin minted in the 2nd century CE, upon which are embossed the words &quot;Half-Shekel&quot; in paleo-Hebrew (). The same coin possesses a silver content of 6.87 grams. According to the Jewish historian Josephus, the annual monetary tribute of the half-Shekel to the Temple at Jerusalem was equivalent to two Athenian drachmæ, each Athenian or Attic drachma weighing a little over 4.3 grams.

===Jewish–Roman wars===
The First Jewish Revolt coinage was issued from AD 66 to 70 amid the First Jewish–Roman War as a means of emphasizing the independence of Judea from Roman rule and replacing the Tyrian shekel with its image of a foreign god which had previously been minted to pay the temple tax.

The Bar Kochba shekel was issued from AD 132 to 135 amid the Bar Kokhba revolt for similar reasons.

===Carthage===

The Punic or Carthaginian shekel was typically around 7.2 grams in silver and 7.5 grams in gold (suggesting an exchange rate of 12:1). It was apparently first developed in Sicily during the mid-4th century BC. It was associated with the payment of Carthage&#x27;s mercenary armies and was repeatedly devalued over the course of each of the Punic Wars. The amount and quality of this currency however increased as a result of the Carthaginian Empire&#x27;s expansion into Spain under the Barcid dynasty before the Second Punic War and recovery under Hannibal before the Third Punic War. Throughout, it was more common for Carthage&#x27;s holdings in North Africa to employ bronze or no coinage except when paying mercenary armies and for most of the coins to circulate in Iberia, Sardinia, and Sicily.

===Tyre===

The Tyrian shekel began to be issued . Owing to the relative purity of its silver, it became the preferred medium of payment for the Temple tax in Jerusalem, despite its royal and pagan imagery. The money changers expelled by Jesus in the four canonical gospels are those who exchanged worshippers&#x27; baser common currency for such shekels. The “30 pieces of silver” paid by the chief priests to Judas Iscariot in exchange for his betrayal of Jesus may be a reference to the Tyrian shekel.

==Present==
===Israel===

The shekel ( in direct transcription) replaced the Israeli pound (, &quot;lira&quot;) in 1980. Its currency symbol was , although it was more commonly notated as ש or IS. It was subdivided into 100 new agorot (אגורות חדשות). It was replaced in 1985 by the new shekel, due to hyperinflation. Its currency symbol is although it is often notated as ש״ח or NIS. It is subdivided into 100 agorot. Both Israeli shekels are solely units of fiat currency, and not related to the weight of any precious metal. With the 2014 series of notes, the Bank of Israel abandoned the transcriptions and in favor of the standard English forms &quot;Shekel&quot; and &quot;Shekels&quot;.

<text>Ilm al-kalam or ilm al-lahut, often shortened to kalam, is the scholastic, speculative, or rational study of Islamic theology (&quot;aqida&quot;). It can also be defined as the science that studies the fundamental doctrines of Islamic faith (&quot;usul al-din&quot;), proving their validity, or refuting doubts regarding them. Kalām was born out of the need to establish and defend the tenets of Islam against the philosophical doubters. A scholar of &quot;kalam&quot; is referred to as a mutakallim (plural mutakallimun), a role distinguished from those of Islamic philosophers and jurists.

After its first beginnings in the late Umayyad period, the Kalām experienced its rise in the early Abbasid period, when the Caliph al-Mahdi commissioned Mutakallimūn to write books against the followers of Iranian religions, and the Barmakid vizier Yahya ibn Khalid held Kalām discussions with members of various religions and confessional groups in his house. Until the 10th century, the Muʿtazilites were considered the real &quot;masters of the Kalām&quot;. Later, two important Sunni Kalām schools emerged: the Ashʿariyya and the Maturidiyya. They positioned the Kalām particularly against the growing Neoplatonic and Aristotelian philosophy and elevated the &quot;Kalām science&quot; (ʿilm al-kalām) to the highest ranking science in Islam. Some of the arguments of the Mutakallimūn also found their way into Jewish and Christian theological discussions in the Middle Ages. After the Kalām science in the early modern period was essentially limited to the study of manuals and commentaries, from the late 19th century onwards various reform thinkers appeared in British India and the Ottoman Empire who called for the founding of a &quot;new Kalām&quot;.

==Definition==
=== Definitions of Kalām in chronological order ===
===Kalām as apologetics===
According to several of the definitions given above, kalām has an apologetic function: it serves to defend one&#x27;s own religious views. This apologetic function is particularly evident in the philosophers al-Farabi (d. 950) and Abu al-Hassan al-Amiri (d. 992). The former sees it as a mental ability through which man can refute everything that contradicts the views and actions established by the founder of the religion, the latter as &quot;the defence of religion with the tongue&quot;. In the definitions of the Ashʿarite scholar Adud al-Din al-Iji (d. 1355), the Ottoman scholar Taşköprüzade (d. 1561) and the Indian scholar at-Tahānawī (around 1745), who worked in Iran, kalām has the task of averting doubts from religious dogmas or truths. Against the background of such definitions, the French orientalist Louis Gardet judged that the function of kalām as a defensive &quot;apology&quot; could not be overestimated. The view that the &quot;fundamental character&quot; of the Kalām consists of &quot;defensive apology&quot; is also the declared leitmotif of the French handbook &quot;Introduction à la théologie musulmane&quot;, co-authored by Gardet and M.M Anawati in 1948.

The Indian scholar ʿAbd an-Nabī al-Ahmadnagarī (d. 1759) even believed that the value of the Kalam was limited to this apologetic function alone. The great Mutakallimūn, he explains in his encyclopedia Dustūr al-ʿulamā, never justified or authenticated their doctrines with arguments from the Kalam, since the sole purpose of the Kalam was to silence the adversary and bring the stubborn to their knees. The great Mutakallimūn, on the other hand, drew their doctrines solely from the &quot;lamp of prophethood&quot;. Such statements can also be found in al-Ghazali. Thus, in his work &quot;Jawahir al-Qur&#x27;an&quot; (The Jewels of the Qur&#x27;an ), he judged that the purpose of the science of kalam was &quot;to protect the beliefs of the masses from disruption by innovators&quot;. On the other hand, this science was never about &quot;revealing the truths&quot;.

=== Kalām as the science of religious foundations or dogmas ===
Several Muslim authors defined kalām by its relationship to the &quot;fundamentals of religion&quot; (Uṣūl al-Dīn). For example, Abu Hayyan al-Tawhidi (d. 1023) described the science of kalām as &quot;a way of contemplating the fundamentals of religion in which deliberation is based on reason alone.&quot; Abu al-Yusr al-Bazdawi (d. 1099) defined it as &quot;the explanation of those questions which constitute the fundamentals of religion, which it is an individual duty to learn.&quot;

Ibn al-Athir (d. 1233) in his book &quot;al-Lubāb fī Tahḏīb al-Ansāb&quot; was the first to define kalām science as &quot;the science of the foundations of religion&quot; (ʿilm Uṣūl al-Dīn). Ibn Khallikan (d. 1282) and Siraj al-Din Urmavi (d. 1283) even equated kalām science with the foundations of religion itself. The equation of ʿilm al-kalām and ʿilm uṣūl al-dīn is also found in the catalogue of the Ottoman Palace Library from the beginning of the 16th century, where the section containing the books on kalām was entitled &quot;Section of the Books of the Science of the Foundations of Religion, i.e. the Science of Kalām&quot;. This classification probably also influenced the Ottoman scholars Taşköprüzade and Saçaklızāde (d. 1732), who also equated kalām science and the &quot;science of the foundations of religion&quot; in their Arabic scientific encyclopedias. At-Tahānawī explains this equation by saying that the Kalām is the basis of the religious legal sciences and that they are based on it.

Some later scholars defined the kalām science of dogmas. For Adud al-Din al-Iji (d. 1355), kalām is &quot;the science of proving religious dogmas by citing arguments and removing doubts.&quot; In a slightly modified form, this definition was also adopted by the Ottoman scholar Tashköprüzāde (d. 1561) and the Indian scholar at-Tahānawī (c. 1745). For al-Taftazani (d. 1390), Kalām is &quot;the knowledge of religious dogmas based on certain evidence&quot;, for Ibn Khaldun (d. 1406) &quot;a science that includes the disputation of the dogmas of faith with rational arguments&quot; and for Morteza Motahhari (d. 1979) &quot;a science that discusses the Islamic dogmas [...] in such a way that it explains, proves and defends them&quot;.

==Linguistic==
===Theories about the origin of the term===
In Arabic , the term Kalām generally means &quot;speech, conversation, debate.&quot; There are different theories as to why this term came to be used to describe the discipline that deals with the rational justification of one&#x27;s own religious doctrines:

* Al-Shahrastani (d. 1153) suggested that the name was coined by the Mu&#x27;tazila. They called this science by this name either because the speech of God was the main question around which their disputations and controversies revolved, so that the whole science was called by it.
* Ibn at-Tilimsanī (d. 1260) considered three different possibilities: 1. the name Kalām comes from the fact that the Mutakallimūn began the chapters in their books with the phrase: &quot;Chapter of speech about...&quot; ( bāb al-kalām fī... ); 2. When the Zahirites were asked about one of the problems of this science, they replied: &quot;That is that about which we are forbidden to speak&quot;. This happened repeatedly, so that after a time it was called &quot;the science of (forbidden) speech&quot;, with the expression &quot;forbidden&quot; eventually being dropped; 3. Science was called ʿilm al-kalām because its learning is one of the most important means of bringing out the intellectual power of speech by which man is distinguished from other living beings.
* Al-Taftazani (d. 1390) gives a total of eight explanations for the name Kalām in his commentary on the confession of an-Nasafī , including the one that this science takes place solely in discussion ( mubāḥaṯa ) and exchange of speech ( idārat al-kalām ) and thus differs from other sciences that can also be practiced in the form of reflection ( taʾammul ) and reading of books ( muṭālaʿat al-kutub ). Another possibility that he discusses is that this science was considered to be speech par excellence because of the strength of its evidence, just as one says of the stronger of two statements: &quot;This is the speech&quot;.
* Ibn Khaldun (d. 1406) suggested that the science of kalām was so called either because the fight against innovations did not require action, but was achieved solely through &quot;speech&quot; (kalām).
* Morteza Motahhari (d. 1979) stated the reason why the name originated from the habit of its scholars speaking (kalām), which is the opposite of silence and the Kalām scholars made statements on questions of faith where silence would have been necessary, imitating the Companions of the Prophet and the Muslims of the second generation, who had also remained silent on the matter.

According to Josef van Ess, the many explanations given by Arab scholars &quot;clearly demonstrate the perplexity of native philologists and theologians when faced with the term kalām &quot;. As for Western scholarship, Tjitze de Boer and Duncan Black MacDonald suggested that the term kalām was derived from the Greek word logos. Arent Jan Wensinck, on the other hand, rejected the view that the term kalām could have anything to do with logos or its derivatives in 1932, and argued that it had arisen &quot;through the development of Arabic terminology itself&quot;. Louis Gardet and M.-M. Anawati considered the first possibility of derivation mentioned by Ibn at-Tilimsānī to be the most likely and suspected that kalām initially meant &quot;speech about...&quot; and then, through antonomasia, became &quot;discourse&quot; per se (about the things of God). W. Montgomery Watt took a similar path of explanation to Ibn Taymiyyah when he wrote about the term mutakalli : &quot;Undoubtedly this was once a derisive name, perhaps creating the image of people &#x27;who talk forever.&#x27; Eventually, however, it became accepted as a neutral term.&quot;

==History==
===The question of origin===

# Maimonides (d. 1204) believed that the Kalām was actually of Christian origin and only later became known to Muslims through translations. Franz August Schmölders rejected this theory as implausible as early as 1840 in his &quot;Essai sur les écoles philosophiques chez les Arabes&quot;. 
# According to Ibn Khaldūn (d. 1406), the science of kalam arose from the fact that disagreements about the details of the doctrines of faith arose in the period after the first Muslims. Most of these disagreements were, in his opinion, caused by ambiguous Quranic verses (Muḥkam and Mutashabih). They led to dispute, disputation and rational argumentation.
# Mohammed Abed al-Jabri (d. 2010) assumes that the Kalam arose in the middle of the 7th century, immediately after the arbitration that ended the war between Ali ibn Abi Talib and Mu&#x27;awiya. During this period, Arab political discourse began to use religion as a mediator. The various parties sought religious legitimacy for their positions, which was the first step in the theoretical formation of what was later called the science of Kalam. Thus, in its historical reality, this science is not just a discourse on the doctrine of faith, but a &quot;practice of politics in religion&quot;.

In fact, the origins of the kalām are obscure. This is also due to the fact that the specifically theological meaning of the words kalām and mutakallim was very slow to gain acceptance. Mutakallim initially only referred to a &quot;speaker with a specific function&quot;.

In the anonymous &quot;Aḫbār al-ʿAbbās wa-waladihī&quot;, which dates from the eighth century, it is reported that when Abu Muslim (d. 755) wanted to establish himself in Merv, he sent mutakallimūn from his followers into the city to win the population over to their cause and make it clear to them that they were following the Sunnah and acting according to the truth. Shlomo Pines has concluded that the term originally arose in Abū Muslim&#x27;s army and referred to political and religious propagandists such as the Dawah.

However, there are reports that indicate that the culture of kalām existed before this. The Arab historian Abu Zakariya al-Azdi (d. 945) cites a report according to which the Umayyad caliph Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz (r. 717–720) is said to have said: &quot;I have argued and spoken with the people. Indeed, I love to speak with the Shia.&quot; The fact that the verb kallama is used here for &quot;to speak with&quot;, from which the word kalām is derived, is seen by Josef van Ess as an indication that the specifically theological meaning of the kalām concept may have already developed at this time.

According to a report quoted in the &quot;Kitab al-Aghani&quot; by Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani (d. 967), there were six representatives of the Kalam (aṣḥāb al-kalām) in Basra: the two Muʿtazilites Amr ibn Ubayd and Wasil ibn Ata, the poet Bashshar ibn Burd, Salih ibn Abd al-Quddus and Abdul Karim bin Abi Al-Awja&#x27;, and a man from the tribe of Azd who was inclined towards Sumanīya, an Indian doctrine, and who made his house available to the group for their meetings. Since Wāsil died around 748, the Kalām must have existed in the late Umayyad period if this report is authentic.

In two narrations cited by Abdullah Ansari (d. 1089), Amr ibn Ubayd is identified as the one who &quot;invented these innovations of kalām&quot;. Abu Hanifa is said to have cursed ʿAmr ibn ʿUbaid for &quot;opening the way for people to speak (kalām) about what it is not their business to speak about.&quot; Ibn Taymiyya (d. 1328), on the other hand, believed that the special type of argumentation that characterizes the Kalam first appeared at the beginning of the second Islamic century with Jaʿd ibn Dirham (d. 724) and Jahm bin Safwan (d. 746). From them it then reached Amr ibn Ubayd and Wasil ibn Ata. According to the Ottoman scholar Taşköprüzade (d. 1561), the spread of the Kalam began as early as the year 100 of the Hijra (= 718/19 AD) through the Muʿtazila and the Qadariya, with Wasil ibn Ata again playing the decisive role. However, neither Wasil ibn Ata nor any other persons mentioned here have recorded book titles or sayings that indicate that they themselves used the term kalām as a name for a particular science or knowledge culture.

According to a report quoted by al-Masudi (d. 956) in his work &quot;The Meadows of Gold&quot;, the Abbasid caliph al-Mahdi (r. 775–785) was the first ruler to commission Mutakallimūn representing Islam to write books against Mulhid from the circle of the Manichaeans, Bardesanites and Marcionites and to refute their arguments. The reason for this was that at that time writings of these groups had spread and were being translated from New Persian and Middle Persian into Arabic.

===Formative years===
In early Islam, the &quot;Ahl al-Kalām&quot; or &quot;Kalamites&quot; essentially referred to the Muʿtazila. Historian Daniel W. Brown describes &quot;Ahl al-Kalām&quot; as one of three main groups engaged in polemical disputes over sources of authority in Islamic law during the second century of Islam: the &quot;Ahl al-Ra&#x27;y&quot; and &quot;Ahl al-Hadith&quot; being the other two. (Brown also describes the Muʿtazila as &quot;the later &quot;ahl al-Kalām&quot;&quot;, suggesting the &quot;ahl al-Kalām&quot; were forerunners of the Muʿtazilites.)

In the times of the Abbasid Caliphate (750–1258 CE), the discipline of Kalām arose in an &quot;attempt to grapple&quot; with several &quot;complex problems&quot; early in the history of Islam, according to historian Majid Fakhry. One was how to rebut arguments &quot;leveled at Islam by pagans, Christians and Jews&quot;. Another was how to deal with (what some saw as the conflict between) the predestination of sinners to hell on the one hand and &quot;divine justice&quot; on the other (some asserting that to be punished for what is beyond someone&#x27;s control is unjust). Also Kalam sought to make &quot;a systematic attempt to bring the conflict in data of revelation (in the Quran and the Traditions) into some internal harmony&quot;. Other factors that might have led the establishment of kalam was an effort by some Islamic scholars to oppose the thoughs of &quot;Zandaqa&quot; in the Islamic world.

Later schools of Kalam like the Kullabis, Asharites and Matuiridis representing as Sunni Islam would develop systems that would defend the core orthodox creedal points of Islam completely on rational grounds, and were open to engaging in kalam in accordance to the Quran and Sunnah. This was unlike the Mutazilites, whose kalam instead prioritised reason over revelation to the point where the Quran and hadith would only be accepted if it aligned with their interpretation of rationalism. The Hanbali school and followers of Ahmed Ibn Hanbal would generally avoid kalam and philosophical talk all together, seeing it as an innovation, and only address it out of necessity. However, Ahmad ibn Hanbal also provided an episode of long feud of Mu&#x27;tazila Quran creationism doctrine opposed by the scripturalists (Atharism) doctrine that Quran as &quot;shifat&quot; (attribution) of God which championed by Ahmad ibn Hanbal, the founder of Hanbali school. Ibn Battah has recorded in his work, &quot;Al-Ibāna &quot;, that Ahmad ibn Hanbal has instructed his students of total academic boycott against the scholars of kalam. Furthermore, Ahmad ibn Hanbal also recorded engaged in long debates against the leading Mu&#x27;tazilite and qadi of caliphate, Ahmad ibn Abi Du&#x27;ad regarding the said matter about the nature of Quran. The Hanbali scholars and followers of Ahmad ibn Hanbal rarely mention about kalam in their teaching, as they consider it as bid&#x27;ah (heresy). After the longtime persecution of Mihna towards the Ahl a-Hadith since the time of his great-grandfather, caliph al-Mutawakkil changed the caliphate policy by restoring them to favor, while abandoning Mu&#x27;tazilites led by Ahmad ibn Abi Du&#x27;ad. The caliph also attempted to reconcile with Ahmad ibn Hanbal, and finally, in March 852, he ordered that all prisoners held on account of the innquisition against the Sunnis be released.

===The heyday under the early Abbasids===
According to Al-Shahrastani, the golden age of the science of kalam began with the caliphs Harun al-Rashid (r. 786–809), al-Ma&#x27;mun (r. 813–833), al-Mu&#x27;tasim (r. 833–842), al-Wathiq (r. 842–847) and al-Mutawakkil (r. 847–861) and ended in the time of Sahib ibn Abbad, who served as vizier of the Buyids of Ray from 979 to 995.

One of the most important promoters of kalam discussions in the early Abbasid period was the Barmakid Yahya ibn Khalid, who served as vizier under Harun al-Rashid. Al-Yaʿqūbī (d. after 905) reports that he loved kalam and discussion (Naẓar), and that in his days the mutakallimūn became numerous and they debated with each other and wrote books. Al-Yaʿqūbī cites Hisham ibn al-Hakam and Dirar ibn Amr (d. 815) as examples of mutakallimīn of this period. According to a report quoted by Ibn Babawayh, Yahya ibn Khalid used to hold a discussion group (maǧlis) at his place on Sundays, in which mutakallimūn from every sect (firqa) and religious community (milla) participated, who then debated with each other about their religions and put forward arguments against each other. This discussion group is also mentioned by al-Masʿūdī . According to his report, many Islamic mutakallimūn participated in this discussion, including Muʿtazilites such as Abu l-Hudhail, Ibrahim al-Nazzam and Bishr ibn al-Muʿtamir, Imamites such as Hisham ibn al-Hakam, one Kharijite and one Murjite each, as well as representatives of other worldviews and faiths, including the Mobed of the Zoroastrians.

The Caliph al-Ma&#x27;mun also distinguished himself by promoting the Kalam. Al-Yaʿqūbī reports that he openly professed the &quot;People of Monotheism and Justice&quot; (Ahl al-Tawhid wal &#x27;Adl), that is, the Muʿtazila, attracted Mutakallimūn to his court and paid them maintenance so that their numbers increased. Each one, explains al-Yaʿqūbī, wrote books to defend his own doctrine and to refute his opponents.

Al-Jahiz (d. 869), who wrote one of the first treatises on the kalam, praised the art of the kalam as a &quot;precious jewel&quot; (juhar tamīn), as &quot;the treasure that never perishes&quot; (al-kanz allaḏī lā yafnā wa-lā yablā) and as the &quot;companion who does not bore and does not deceive&quot;. It is the standard for every other art, the rein for every expression, the scales with which one can clarify the lack or excess of every thing, and the filter with which one can recognize the purity or impurity of every thing. All scholars depend on it, and it is the tool and model for every acquisition. What could be more important than something without which one cannot prove the glory of God or prophethood, and without which one cannot distinguish the true argument from the false argument and the proof from the false proof. The kalam makes it possible to distinguish the community (jama&#x27;a) from the sect (firqa) and the Sunnah from the Bid&#x27;ah. Al-Jahiz also compares the kalam to a border fortress, the defence of which requires great personal commitment. It is like a border fortress because all people are hostile towards its followers. Whoever gives this science its due can expect a corresponding reward. [ 85 ] Al-Jāhiz praises the Mutakallimūn for remaining loyal to their discipline out of conviction of its high value, despite the rejection that their discipline experiences in society, and for even being willing to accept the sacrifice of poverty and lack of career opportunities as a Qadi.

In another writing, al-Jahiz stated that without the Kalam, there would be no religion for God and no one would be distinguished from the heretics . There would be no difference between falsehood and truth and no separation between a prophet and a mere pretender to prophethood. Argument could not be distinguished from deceit and proof could not be distinguished from apparent proof. The art of the Kalam was preferable to every other art and education , which is why it was made the standard for all philosophical speculation and the basis of every syllogism . It was only held in such high esteem because every scholar needed it and could not do without it.

===10th and 11th centuries: Spread from Iraq to the east and west===
Until the early 10th century, the Kalam was essentially limited to Iraq and Greater Khorasan . A very important center of the Kalam culture was the Muʿtazilite stronghold of ʿAskar Mukram in Khuzistan, the place of work of Al-Jubba&#x27;i and his son Abu Hashim al-Jubba&#x27;i. The geographer Ibn Hauqal (d. 977) reports that members of the common people also practiced the Kalam method here and achieved such mastery that they could compete with scholars from other cities. Ibn Hawqal reports in his book &quot;Surat Al-Ard&quot; that he saw two porters in the city who were carrying heavy loads on their heads or backs and at the same time arguing about the interpretation of the Quran and questions of the Kalam.

During the course of the 10th century, the Kalam also spread more widely to the eastern regions of the Islamic Empire. One of the early Kalam scholars representing the Mu&#x27;tazila in Khorasan was Abū al-Qāsim al-Balkhī (d. 931). Other Kalam scholars such as Al-Qadi Abd al-Jabbar (d. 1024) settled in Rayy. In the late 10th century, the two renowned Ash&#x27;ari Kalam scholars, Ibn Furak and Abu Ishaq al-Isfarayini (d. 1027) having studied in Baghdad arrived to teach in Khurasan at this time. Some of the prominent Shafi&#x27;i families in Nishapur took up the cause of Ash&#x27;arism and it became well-established in the city, which developed into the main hub of Shafi&#x27;ite learning in the East. Ash&#x27;arism swiftly proliferated throughout Iran&#x27;s other Shafi&#x27;ite communities. It developed into the mainstream Shafi&#x27;ite ideology in the Islamic world during the Seljuk era.

In the Maghreb and al-Andalus, on the other hand, the Kalam was not yet a topic of discussion until the early 11th century. Al-Baqillani a Maliki jurist contributed to the propagation of Ash&#x27;arism within the Maliki circles in North Africa. One of his students, Abu Dharr al-Harawi was the first to introduce the Ash&#x27;ari doctrine to the Holy Sanctuary of Mecca. Among the hundreds of Andalusi and Maghrebi pupils that Abu Dharr al-Harawi trained to become jurists and judges, and who helped Ash&#x27;arism expand to their home countries are Abu al-Walid al-Baji and Abu Imran al-Fasi. However, research shows that his students weren&#x27;t the first to introduce Ash&#x27;arism as there were already known Ash&#x27;ari presence in the Tunisia such as Ibn Abi Zayd al-Qayrawani and Abu al-Hassan al-Qabisi. In al-Andalus, Ash&#x27;arism was flourishing since the time of the theologian-philosopher Ibn Hazm (d. 1064). The theologian Abu Bakr al-Baqillani&#x27;s works were widely circulated in the region, which helped fostered the growth of Ash&#x27;arite theology and sparked debates. Eventually, Mu&#x27;tazilite beliefs in the region were subdued. Shortly after, the Ash&#x27;ari theology became the mainstream doctrine of the Maliki school.

The Mu&#x27;tazila, also known as the Ahl al-Tawhid wal-&#x27;Adl, or the &quot;People of Divine Unity and Justice,&quot; were originally the dominant school of kalam, but by the tenth century, two madhabs—the Ash&#x27;ariyya and the Maturidiyya—rose in fierce opposition to the Mu&#x27;tazila. Each school bore the names of its founders, Abu Hasan al-Ash&#x27;ari and Abu Mansur al-Maturidi, and represented Ahl al-Sunnah (People of Prophetic ways). In the tenth and eleventh centuries, the Maturidites flourished in Khurasan and Central Asia, while the Ash&#x27;arites posed a threat to Mu&#x27;tazila hegemony in central Iraq and Iran. Both schools use kalam to defend what we now refer to as &quot;orthodox Islam&quot; or traditionalist Islamic theological doctrine. Mu&#x27;tazalism would eventually fall because of this. This is noted by Western historians, who label the Mu&#x27;tazila as a heterodox theological movement and extreme rationalists. The group would continue to exist and primarily follow Shia and Ibadi.

===Post-classical period and “conservatism”===

The most influential work of the post-classical Kalām was the &quot;Kitāb al-Mawāqif&quot; by the Iranian Shafi&#x27;i theologian Adud al-Din al-Iji (d. 1355). It received a total of five commentaries and 32 supercommentaries and became part of the Dars al-Nizāmī curriculum in the South Asian madrasas. The book also played an important role in Ottoman schools. The Ottoman scholar Sāčaqlızāde recommended it to scholars in the Kalām section of his encyclopedia &quot;Tartīb al-ʿulūm&quot;, together with the &quot;Kitāb al-Maqāṣid&quot; by Saʿd ad-Dīn at-Taftāzānī, as a basis for teaching. The work contains an introductory chapter at the beginning in which the author discusses the definition, subject, utility, rank, problems and naming of the science of Kalām.

At the end of the 14th century, Ibn Khaldun believed that the science of Kalam was no longer necessary for students of his time, because the heretics and innovators had since perished and it was sufficient to study what the Sunni imams had written to defend themselves against them. However, the science of Kalam experienced a revival in the 17th and 18th centuries in what is now Mauritania. A particularly zealous follower of the Kalam was the Ash&#x27;arite scholar Muhammad ibn &#x27;Umar al-Bartallī (d. 1696) in Walatah. A West African biography collection reports that he was one of the famous Mutakallimūn and was constantly busy reading, copying and teaching Kalam books. The Kalām was also promoted among the Volga-Ural Tatars in Russia . At the end of the 18th century, it became an integral part of madrasa scholarship in villages and small towns, even if it was limited to commentaries and glosses.

However, the early modern period was a phase of &quot;frozen conservatism&quot; for Kalām science, as Louis Gardet writes. Muslim scholars also diagnosed a decline in this discipline. The Ottoman-Turkish scholar İsmail Hakkı İzmirli (d. 1946), for example, complained that in his time there were very few people who really knew the Kalām problems and understood the Kalām riddles. There is hardly a Kalam scholar who understands more than the Kalam questions of a book, and the science of Kalam is limited to the study of the commentary on the ʿAqāʾid of Najm al-Dīn Abū Hafs an-Nasafī (d. 1142) and on the ʿAqāʾid of ʿAdud al-Dīn al-Īji (d. 1355).

===Modern attempts at revival===
Mulla Sadra, 17th AD Twelver Shia philosopher and mystic; has felt that he owed to the greek philosophy, for the development of kalam as Islamic discourse. Modern philosopher Federico Campagna has suspected the similarity between the unique cosmological kalam philosophy taught by Mulla Sadra with Hindu Vedic Upanishads philosophy. In retrospect, Muhammad Kamal from Islamic studies at the Melbourne institute has stated Mulla Sadra philosophy was influenced by Avicenna and Ibn Arabi.

Ruhollah Khomeini, Iranian Islamic revolutionary, politician, religious leader who served as the first Supreme Leader of Iran, founder of modern day Islamic Republic of Iran and the main leader of the Iranian Revolution; has used kalam to facilitate his socio-religious revival of moral spirit of the masses. As he formulate the revolutionary system on his states building, Khomeini&#x27;s political thoughts was closely linked with kalam discourse.

== As an Islamic discipline ==

Although seeking knowledge in Islam is considered a religious obligation, the study of kalam is considered by Muslim scholars to fall beyond the category of necessity and is usually the preserve of qualified scholars, eliciting limited interest from the masses or common people.

The early Muslim scholar al-Shafi&#x27;i held that there should be a certain number of men trained in kalam to defend and purify the faith, but that it would be a great evil if their arguments should become known to the mass of the people.

Similarly, the Islamic scholar al-Ghazali held the view that the science of kalam is not a personal duty on Muslims but a collective duty. Like al-Shafi&#x27;i, he discouraged the masses from studying it and that only the most able do so.

==Criticism==
Despite the dominance of kalam as an intellectual tradition within Islam, some scholars were critical of its use. For example, Hanbali school and followers of Ahmed Ibn Hanbal would generally avoid kalam and philosophical talk all together, seeing it as an innovation. The same sentiments is also found within the Zahiri school.; The modern Wahhabi and Salafi movements generally consider kalam to be an innovation and reject its usage.

The Hanbali Sufi, Khwaja Abdullah Ansari wrote a treatise entitled &quot;Dhamm al-Kalam&quot; where he criticized the use of kalam.

Ibn al-Jawzi, 12th AD Hanbali scholar; has explained that that Ulama and Fiqh of his contemporary have considered kalam as &quot;..useless discipline..&quot;. He described the kalam scholars progression was at first &quot;because they were exposed to foreign literatures about philosophy...&quot;, then in the end they established kalam, which in practice damaged their creed of Islam.

Ibn Qudama, 13th AD Hanbali scholar; harshly criticized kalam as one of the worst of all heresies. He characterized their scholars, the &quot;mutakallimūn&quot;, as innovators and heretics who had betrayed and deviated from the simple and pious faith of the early Muslims.

Al-Dhahabi, 14th AD Hanbali scholar and historian; has made his derogatory statement towards kalam scholar by comparing them with Abu Jahl, the reviled figure in Islam during the time of Muhammad.

Ibn Taymiyya, 14th AD Hanbali scholar; was notable for his bold stance against the doctrines of Mutakallimin in his works such as &quot;ar-Radd &#x27;ala al-mantiqiyyın&quot; (Refutation of the Rationalists), and &quot;bayan muwafaqat al-&#x27;aql al-sarih li al-Naql as-Sahiha&quot;. Ibn Taymiyya even further criticize Ash&#x27;arite rationalists such as al-Ghazali, Fakhr al-Din al-Razi, and al-Shahrastani for their method in discourses by abandoning the scripturalism way. In general, Ibn Taymiyya has detailed his criticism in &quot;Ar-Radd &#x27;ala al-Mantiqiyyin&quot;. Regarding al-Ghazali in particular, Through the seventh chapter of his book, &quot;Mi&#x27;yar Al-&#x27;Ilm&quot;, Ibn Taymiyyah wrote that although he recognized that al-Ghazali&#x27;s intention are not inherently bad in his attempt to describe the limit of human&#x27;s mind in metaphysical and esoterical concepts, as it was aimed to oppose the core idea of kalam scholars that everything must be grasped by logic; although he still held that such discourse are moot as it only distract al-Ghazali from the important aspect of literal meanings, while it kept al-Ghazali busy with irrelevant semantic argumentations.

Al-Shawkani, a 18th AD Atharism, Zahiri scholar, early Salafi movement figure, and Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab contemporary; has expressed his view for literal theological interpretation and opposition to kalam (speculative theology).

Siddiq Hasan Khan, 19th AD North Indian Salafi scholar, co-founder of Ahl-i Hadith movement, and also Nawab (viceroy) of Bhopal State; has rejected kalam as he regards it as &quot;full of speculations&quot;. It was stated by himself that his opposition towards kalam were influenced by the thoughts of Al-Shawkani, Al-San&#x27;ani and Ibn Taymiyya.

Rashid Rida, 19th century AD reformer of Islamics school; in his later years of life has perceived the Athari theology as more rational than Kalam and actively condemning Kalam, as he view the Athari methodology had stronger religious foundations of Islam. Furthermore, he also saw the Ash&#x27;arite theology as ineffective against philosophical doubts.

Al-Albani, prominent figure of Salafism and modern era Hadith scholar; considered kalam doctrine as misguided in the Islamic creed due to their Ta&#x27;til methodology, which consequently divesting the Names of God in Islam. Al-Albani stated the notable example was the rejection of kalam scholars of the &quot;al-ʿAliyy&quot; (Most highest) attribute of God.

Manzoor Elahi, 21th century AD Bangladeshi Salafi scholar and academic; has stated in his book &quot;The Importance of Right Aqeedah in Reforming Society&quot; edited by Abubakar Muhammad Zakaria says about Ilmul Kalam,
Similar sentiment were also stated by ʻUthmān ibn Jumʻah Ḍumayrīyah, an Islamic theology professor of University of Sharjah and Umm al-Qura University; that kalam science inherently contradicts the Islamic creed of al-Burooj chapter regarding the attribute of God&#x27;s name as omnipotent (al-Jabbār); which contain the attribute of capability to perform any wills (yurīd). ʻUthmān views that kalam&#x27;s doctrine omitted such attribute by human&#x27;s logic only.

==History of the building==

===Hospital===
The building is on the site of the first General Hospital of Madrid. King Philip II centralised all the hospitals that were scattered throughout the court. In the eighteenth century, King Ferdinand VI decided to build a new hospital because the facilities at the time were insufficient for the city. The building was designed by architect José de Hermosilla and his successor Francisco Sabatini who did the majority of the work. In 1805, after numerous work stoppages, the building was to assume its function that it had been built for, which was being a hospital, although only one-third of the proposed project by Sabatini was completed. Since then it has undergone various modifications and additions until, in 1969, it was closed down as a hospital.

===Art museum===
Extensive modern renovations and additions to the old building were made starting in 1980. The central building of the museum was once an 18th-century hospital. The building functioned as the Centro del Arte (Art Centre) from 1986 until established as the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía in 1988. In 1988, portions of the new museum were opened to the public, mostly in temporary configurations; that same year it was decreed by the Ministry of Culture as a national museum. Its architectural identity was radically changed in 1989 by Ian Ritchie with the addition of three glass circulation towers.

===Expansion===
An 8000 m2 (86,000 ft2) expansion costing €92 million designed by French architect Jean Nouvel opened in October 2005. The extension includes spaces for temporary exhibitions, an auditorium of 500 seats, and a 200-seat auditorium, a bookshop, restaurants and administration offices. ducks scéno was consultant for scenographic equipment of auditoriums and Arau Acustica for acoustic studies.

===Other facilities===
Reina Sofía has other two places where several exhibitions usually take place. These are the Crystal Palace and the Velázquez Palace, both in Retiro Park.
==Notable works==
*&quot;Guernica&quot; by Pablo Picasso
*&quot;The Great Masturbator&quot; by Salvador Dalí
*&quot;Equal-Parallel/Guernica-Bengasi&quot; by Richard Serra
*&quot;6 TV Dé-Coll/age&quot; by Wolf Vostell

==Popular culture ==
The museum features, as a major protagonist, in Jim Jarmusch&#x27;s &quot;The Limits of Control&quot; (2009).

In the 2003 Spanish film &quot;Noviembre&quot;, the school entrance scenes and some performance scenes were shot in the square in front of the museum.

<doc id="236836" wikidata="Q560461" url="?curid=236836" title="Jersey Joe Walcott">
<text>Arnold Raymond Cream (January 31, 1914 – February 25, 1994), best known as Jersey Joe Walcott, was an American professional boxer who competed from 1930 to 1953. He held the New York State Athletic Commission (NYSAC), National Boxing Association (NBA), and &quot;The Ring&quot; heavyweight titles from 1951 to 1952, and broke the record for the oldest man to win the title, at the age of 37. That record would hold for over three decades until it was eventually broken in 1994 by 45-year-old George Foreman. Despite holding the world heavyweight title for a relatively short period of time, Walcott was regarded among the best heavyweights in the world during the 1940s and 1950s.

After retiring from boxing, Walcott did some acting, playing small parts in a few movies and television shows. He also refereed several boxing matches, but after the controversial ending to the second fight between Muhammad Ali and Sonny Liston, Walcott was not asked to referee again. From 1971 to 1974, Walcott held the elected position of Sheriff of Camden County, New Jersey, the first African-American to do so. From 1975 to 1984, he was the chairman of the New Jersey State Athletic Commission.

==Early life==
Walcott was born in Pennsauken Township, New Jersey. His father was an immigrant from St. Thomas, Danish West Indies. His mother was from Jordantown (Pennsauken Township), New Jersey. Walcott was only 15 years old when his father died. He quit school and worked in a soup factory to support his mother and 11 younger brothers and sisters. Later he married Lydia Cream, and the two had six children together.

From a relatively young age Walcott began training as a boxer. He took the name of his boxing idol, Joe Walcott, a welterweight champion from Barbados. He added &quot;Jersey&quot; to distinguish himself and show where he was from.

==Boxing career==
Walcott debuted as a professional boxer at the young age of 16 on September 9, 1930, fighting Eddie &quot;Cowboy&quot; Wallace and winning by a knockout in round one.
After this first victory, Walcott fought on and off throughout the rest of the decade (Walcott lacked professional management and a regular training routine, causing him to struggle during his early career). Although he defeated a young Elmer Ray, he lost two bouts to Tiger Jack Fox and was knocked out by heavyweight contender Abe Simon in 1940. After losing to Simon, Walcott was inactive for over four years. During World War II, Walcott secured a wartime job, and did not fight again until 1944, winning two matches against local fighters Felix Del Paoli and Ellis Singleton.It was during these fights that Walcott was noticed by local boxing manager Felix Bocchicchio, who saw great potential in the fighter. Although Bocchicchio had a criminal history, he was well connected in the boxing scene and was able to provide Walcott and his family with financial stability, so that Walcott could now focus on fighting full time. He also got Walcott professional trainers, Nick and Dan Florio (two brothers who worked with several world champions). Together they got Walcott on a professional routine and diet, while improving his footwork and counter punching to turn him into a very crafty fighter.

Now under professional management, Walcott resumed his boxing career in 1945. He quickly rose through the heavyweight ranks, defeating top contenders including Joe Baksi, Jimmy Bivins, Lee Oma and Tommy Gómez. Despite closing out 1946 with losses to future light heavyweight champion Joey Maxim and a rematch with top ranked heavyweight contender Elmer Ray, he promptly avenged both of those defeats in 1947 and rose to the rank of #1 heavyweight contender.

=== Walcott vs Louis ===
Now the top contender, Walcott fought heavyweight champion Joe Louis on December 5, 1947. At 33 years of age Walcott broke the record as the oldest man to fight for the world heavyweight title, although he was only four months older than Louis at the time. At this point, Louis had been champion for over ten years and this would be his 24th title defense.

Walcott fought very well, dropping Louis in round one and again in round four, but lost a highly controversial 15-round split decision. Most boxing writers felt Walcott deserved the win; a debate ensued, and sportswriters carried the topic throughout America. The lone official to vote for Walcott, referee Ruby Goldstein, was cast as a hero. Letters and telegrams poured in to the Goldstein household, praising his judgment. There was talk of an investigation being assembled for rule revisions in judging. Louis went into seclusion for a couple of days, then quieted dissent with the following: &quot;I know Ruby. He calls them as he sees them and that should be good enough for anybody.&quot;

What controversy remained was the kind that builds the gate, and Jersey Joe was rightfully granted a rematch on June 25, 1948. The heavily anticipated fight proved to also be competitive. Walcott dropped Louis once again, this time in the third round, but Louis went on to rally, and ultimately prevailed, scoring a knockout in round 11. The bout was Louis&#x27; record 25th and final title defense before announcing his first retirement. The rematch was also the world&#x27;s first closed-circuit telecast (CCTV) sports broadcast, distributed via theatre television.

=== Walcott vs Charles ===

On June 22, 1949, Walcott got another chance to become a world champion when he faced the highly skilled Ezzard Charles for the NBA heavyweight title left vacant by Louis. Charles prevailed, winning a unanimous decision over 15 rounds. Walcott, disappointed but eager to see his dream of being a champion come true, fought on, and in 1950 he won four of his five bouts, including a third-round knockout of future world light heavyweight champion Harold Johnson.

On March 7, 1951, he and Charles fought another title fight. Charles had defeated Louis the previous year, and was now the undisputed heavyweight champion. Walcott fought well, but was hurt in the ninth round when he was dropped by a sharp left hook. Walcott survived the round but once again Charles won a 15-round decision to retain his world title.

Despite losing four title shots, only four months later, Walcott joined a small handful of boxers who claimed the world title on their fifth try. Charles fought Walcott in another title fight on July 18, 1951, in Pittsburgh. This time Walcott gave his best performance of their entire series of fights, winning most of the rounds and knocking out Charles in the seventh round to finally become world heavyweight champion at the age of 37. This made him the oldest man ever to win the world heavyweight crown, a distinction he would hold until George Foreman won the title at age 45 in 1994. Walcott retained his title in a fourth and final fight with his arch-rival Charles on June 5, 1952, this time winning a close 15-round decision.

=== Losing the Title ===
On September 23, 1952, Wacott put his title on the line for the second time, and this time his opponent was the undefeated Rocky Marciano. In the first round, Walcott floored Marciano with a left hook; the first time in his career that Rocky had ever been down. After twelve intense rounds, Walcott stood well ahead on two of the three official scorecards, leaving Marciano needing a knockout to win. In the thirteenth round, with Marciano pressuring Walcott against the ropes, simultaneously each threw a right hand. Marciano landed first and flush on Walcott&#x27;s jaw with a devastating right hook and a powerful left followup. The title changed hands in an instant. Walcott collapsed with his left arm hanging over the ropes, slowly sinking to the canvas, where he was counted out. An immediate rematch was set for May 15, 1953 in Chicago. The second time around Walcott was again defeated by Marciano by a knockout, this time in the first round. It would be Walcott&#x27;s last bout.

==Life after boxing==
Walcott did not go away from the celebrity scene after boxing. In 1956, he co-starred with Humphrey Bogart and Max Baer in the boxing drama &quot;The Harder They Fall&quot;. In 1963, he tried professional wrestling, losing to Lou Thesz. Thesz pinned Walcott in the fifth round, but has stated that Walcott knocked him (Thesz) down and most likely out in that fifth round. As he fell to the floor, he relied on instinct, grabbing Walcott&#x27;s knees, taking him down with him and stretching him out for the pin.

Walcott also refereed several notable fights, but in 1965 he oversaw the controversial world heavyweight championship rematch between Muhammad Ali and Sonny Liston. Walcott lost the count as Ali circled around a floored Liston and Walcott tried to get him back to a neutral corner. Walcott then looked outside of the ring (presumably to the ringside count keeper) as Ali and Liston went at each other, before Walcott instructed them to keep on fighting. Walcott then approached the fighters and abruptly stopped the fight. This incident effectively ended his career as a referee, although he eventually returned to officiate two more fights in the late 1970s.

===Political career===
After retiring, Walcott worked for the Camden County corrections department. In 1968, he ran for Sheriff of Camden County, New Jersey, but lost in the Democratic primary to Spencer H. Smith Jr. That same year he was named director of community relations for Camden.

In 1971, he ran again for Camden County Sheriff. He defeated Republican William Strang in the general election. He was the first African-American to serve as Sheriff in Camden County.

He served as chairman of the New Jersey State Athletic Commission from 1975 until 1984, when he stepped down at the mandatory retirement age of 70. Walcott was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in Canastota, New York.

==Honors==
In 2013, Walcott was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame.

<doc id="236839" wikidata="Q13650" url="?curid=236839" title="Calabarzon">
<text>Calabarzon (officially stylized in all caps; ; ), sometimes referred to as Southern Tagalog () and designated as Region IVA, is an administrative region in the Philippines. It is situated southeast of Metro Manila and is bordered by Manila Bay and the South China Sea to the west, Lamon Bay and the Bicol Region to the east, Tayabas Bay and the Sibuyan Sea to the south, and Central Luzon to the north. Comprising five provinces—Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, and Quezon (hence the acronym)—and one highly urbanized city, Lucena, it is the most populous region in the Philippines, according to the 2020 census (PSA), with over 16.1 million inhabitants. It is also the country&#x27;s second most densely populated region, after the National Capital Region. Calamba in Laguna serves as the regional center, while Antipolo in Rizal is the most populous city in the region.

Before its creation as a separate region, Calabarzon, along with the Mimaropa region, the province of Aurora, and parts of Metro Manila, comprised the historical region known as Southern Tagalog until they were separated in 2002 through Executive Order No. 103.

The history of the area now known as Calabarzon dates back to early historic times. Local historians believe that three of the 10th century place-names mentioned in the Philippines&#x27; earliest known written document, the Laguna Copperplate Inscription, pertain to regions or polities (&quot;bayan&quot;) along the shores of Laguna de Bay; and some Filipino-Chinese scholars believe the 10th century trading polity known as Ma-i may actually have been the predecessor of the present day town of Bay, Laguna. Since the Spanish colonial period of the Philippines, the region has served as home to some of the most important Philippine historical figures, including the Philippine national hero, José Rizal, who was born in Calamba.

==Etymology==
The name of the region is an acronym of its five component provinces: Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal and Quezon.

==History==
On June 5, 1901, a convention was called on whether or not the province of Manila should annex the district of Morong, which was found to be unable to be self-sufficient as a province. Eventually, on June 11, &quot;Act No. 137&quot; of the First Philippine Commission abolished Morong and created a new province, named after the Philippines&#x27; national hero, Jose Rizal, who, coincidentally, was a native of Laguna. The new province comprised 29 municipalities, 17 from Manila and 12 from Morong. In 1902, Macario Sakay, a veteran Katipunan member, established the Tagalog Republic in the mountains of Rizal. Ultimately, Sakay&#x27;s Tagalog Republic ended in 1906 when he and his men were betrayed under the guise of holding a national assembly aimed at the self-determination of the Filipino people.

On September 7, 1946, the Third Philippine Republic enacted &quot;Republic Act No. 14&quot;, which renamed the province of Tayabas to &quot;Quezon&quot;, in honor of Manuel Quezon, the second President of the Philippines and elected governor of Tayabas in 1906 and congressman of 1st district of Tayabas in 1907 and a native of Baler (now part of Aurora), formerly one of the towns of Quezon Province. In 1951, the northern part of Quezon became the sub-province Aurora, named after Quezon&#x27;s wife, also a native of Baler. One obvious reason for creating the sub-province was the area&#x27;s isolation from the rest of Quezon Province: there were no direct links to the rest of the province and much of the terrain was mountainous and heavily forested, which made the area relatively isolated, and its distance from Quezon&#x27;s capital Lucena. 

On September 24, 1972, President Ferdinand Marcos enacted &quot;Presidential Decree No. 1&quot;, which organized the provinces into 11 regions as part of Marcos&#x27; Integrated Reorganization Plan. The IRP created Region IV, known as the Southern Tagalog region, and was the largest region in the Philippines. At this time, Region IV consisted of Batangas, Cavite, Laguna, Marinduque, Oriental Mindoro, Occidental Mindoro, Quezon, Rizal, Romblon, and Palawan. In 1979, Aurora formally became a province independent of Quezon and was also included in Region IV.

On May 17, 2002, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo signed &quot;Executive Order No. 103&quot;, which reorganized the Southern Tagalog region. Due to its size, Region IV was split into two separate regions, Region IV-A (Calabarzon) and Region IV-B (Mimaropa). Aurora was transferred to Region III, Central Luzon, the province&#x27;s geographic location; the total separation of Aurora from Quezon &amp; transfer of Aurora to Central Luzon were the fulfillment of the wishes of the residents of the original Municipalities of Baler and Casiguran to be truly independent from the Quezon Province for the first time &amp; the result of original formation of Pampanga since the Spanish occupation. Many residents and government leaders of Aurora objected to the change, as Aurora maintains strong historical and cultural connections to the rest of Southern Tagalog, particularly Quezon Province, thus also of the memory of Manuel Quezon, and with that, Aurora residents self-identified with Quezon; but Aurora&#x27;s transfer to Central Luzon means that geographically, the province is more accessible by land from Nueva Ecija and of course, San Fernando, Pampanga, the regional capital of Central Luzon. The next year, Arroyo signed &quot;Executive Order No. 246&quot;, which declared Calamba as the regional center of the region. On the other hand, Lucena is home to most of the branches of governmental agencies, businesses, banks and service facilities in the region.

==Geography==
The region is the 12th largest region in the Philippines, with an area of . The region itself is relatively flat, but also consists of coastal areas and highlands. It is bordered by Manila Bay in the west, Metro Manila, Bulacan, and Aurora in the north, Lamon Bay and Bicol in the east, and the Isla Verde Passage in the south. Each province in the region is composed of different environments, ranging from low coastal areas to rugged mountainous ones.

Cavite is characterized by rolling hinterlands punctured by hills, with a shoreline bordering Manila Bay and a rugged portion bordering Batangas near Mount Pico de Loro. Tagaytay is located in Cavite, bordering Alfonso, Silang, Calamba, and Santa Rosa. Mount Sungay is the highest peak in the province and can be found in Tagaytay. There are nine islands in Cavite, most notable of which is the island of Corregidor. Historically a site of great strategic importance, Corregidor is found at the mouth of Manila Bay and is under the jurisdiction of Cavite City.

Laguna has rugged terrain, with narrow plains near the shores of Laguna de Bay and mountainous ranges further inland. Laguna de Bay is the largest lake in the Philippines, and is named after the town of Bay. Laguna is also home to Mount Makiling, a dormant volcano near Los Baños reputed for its mystical properties. There are also a lot of hot springs near the Makiling area, especially in San Pablo. Another famous landmark in Laguna are the Pagsanjan Falls, in Cavinti. The water from the Pagsanjan Falls comes from the Bumbungan River. Mount Banahaw borders Laguna and Quezon, and is similarly considered to be a holy mountain like Makiling.
The Batangas area is mostly elevated, with small low flat lands and scattered mountain areas. Batangas is also home to the Taal Volcano, a complex volcano and one of the 16 Decade Volcanoes. The Taal Volcano is situated within Taal Lake, making Taal a third-order island, and possibly one of the largest in the world. Other islands in Batangas are Verde Island, near the Isla Verde Passage, and Fortune Island in Nasugbu. Batangas borders Cavite via Mount Pico de Loro, known for the views that could be found in its summit. Mount Macolod and Mount Batulao can also be found in Batangas.

Rizal is situated north of Laguna de Bay, and consists of a mixture of valleys and mountain ranges, with flat low-lying areas in the western portion of the province near Manila. The eastern portion of Rizal has hills and ridges which form part of the Sierra Madre range. Talim Island, the largest island in Laguna de Bay, is under the jurisdiction of the province of Rizal.

Quezon province is mountainous, with few plains and swamps, and the tail-end of the Sierra Madre running through it. Quezon is a narrow province, with the Tayabas Isthmus comprising the southern part of the province and connecting it to the Bicol Peninsula. The southern part also consists of the Bondoc Peninsula, sandwiched between the Tayabas Bay and Ragay Gulf. 
The largest islands in Quezon are the Alabat and Polillo islands, which are both located in Lamon Bay, connecting to Calauag Bay of the town of Calauag. Laguna shares a border with Quezon via Mount Banahaw.

==Administrative divisions==
===Provinces===

Calabarzon comprises five provinces, 1 &quot;highly urbanized&quot; city, 21 &quot;component&quot; cities and 4,019 barangays.

===Cities===

Antipolo is the most populous city in the region, as well as the 6th most populous city of the whole Philippines, while Bacoor and San Pedro is the most densely populated cities in the whole region. A large section of Calabarzon is considered part of the Greater Manila Area; while Batangas City is the center of the Batangas metropolitan area. The region has a gross regional product of ₱1.65 trillion (at current prices), which accounts for 17% of the national GDP.

On August 7, 2000, the municipality of Los Baños, Laguna, was declared as a &quot;Special Science and Nature City of the Philippines&quot; through Presidential Proclamation No. 349 in recognition of its importance as a center for science and technology, being home to many prestigious educational, environmental and research institutions. This proclamation does not convert the municipality to a city or give it corporate powers that are accorded to other cities.

Notes
==Demographics==

Calabarzon has a population of 16.1 million people, the largest of all the regions of the Philippines. The population growth rate between 2000 and 2010 of 3.07% decreased from the growth rate between 1990 and 2000 of 3.91%, a trend which coincided with the rest of the nation. Life expectancy in Calabarzon is 68.9 years for men and 75.2 years for women. There are an estimated 356,000 Overseas Filipino Workers originating from Calabarzon.

A vast majority of people living in Calabarzon are Tagalogs. It is estimated that around 5.8 million Tagalogs live in Region IV-A. Taal, in particular, is considered the &quot;Heartland of Tagalog Culture&quot; and is currently the &quot;center&quot; of the Tagalog culture and people. Calabarzon is also home to a sizable number of people with Chinese and Spanish ancestry on account of Chinese immigration and Spanish colonization, respectively.

===Languages===
Because of the large majority of Tagalog natives, the majority of people living in Calabarzon speak the Tagalog language. Filipino, being a version of Tagalog, is predominant in the region, which is spoken as a lingua franca of Tagalog speakers of different dialects. English is also used in Calabarzon. In Cavite, Chavacano, a creole language, was once commonly spoken; however, its usage is now in steep decline, and it is now only spoken by a handful of elderly residents in the province. The other native language spoken in Calabarzon is Hatang Kayi, also named as Sinauna, a Central Luzon language spoken in Tanay, Rizal and General Nakar, Quezon; this is related to Kapampangan and Sambalic languages. Other native languages spoken in the region are the &quot;Manide language&quot; in east Quezon and a small portion in north Quezon, the &quot;Umiray Dumaget language&quot; in north Quezon and a small area in central Quezon, the &quot;Inagta Alabat language&quot; on Alabat Island, and the &quot;Tagabulós language&quot; in Infanta.

It is then followed up by the (3.06%) , Philippine Independent Church (0.066%) and the Jesus is Lord Church (0.4%). A small Muslim population also exists, accounting for 0.4% of the regional population.


==Economy==
Calabarzon is the second largest contributor to the national GDP, accounting for 17% of the gross domestic product. The region boasts a 2.1% inflation rate, lower than the national average of 3%. The region has a 9.2% unemployment rate which is higher than the national average of 7%. Calabarzon, much like the rest of the country, is caught in the middle of being an industrial and an agricultural economy.

Due to the region&#x27;s proximity to Metro Manila, a large amount of urbanization has taken place over the years. Cavite and Laguna in particular are sites of manufacturing and high-tech industries, with companies like Intel and Panasonic setting up plants in the region. Santa Rosa, Laguna, is home to a host of semi-conductor and automotive companies such as Amkor and Toyota, while General Trias is home to Cavite&#x27;s largest economic development zone, the PEC Industrial Park.

The region still has a large agricultural base. As of 2002, the region had 282,700 farms, covering , or 36.3% of the region&#x27;s total land area. Cavite alone has almost of agricultural land. Laguna is home to the International Rice Research Institute, which can be found within the University of the Philippines Los Baños, whose main goal is to find sustainable ways to help rice farmers. Batangas, meanwhile, is home to a large pineapple and coconut industry, which is used to make barong tagalogs and lambanog. Quezon is the country&#x27;s leader in coconut products such as coconut oil and copra. Quezon&#x27;s towns such as Tayabas City, Mauban and Infanta are also known producers of commercialized native liqueurs such as lambanog and tuba. Rizal is known for its piggeries. Region IV-A&#x27;s agricultural base, however, is slowly decreasing. Due to their proximity to large bodies of water, Laguna and Batangas also have sizable fishing industries. Taal Lake is a large source of fresh water fishes for the country.

==Tourism==

Due to the region&#x27;s history and natural resources, tourism plays a major role in the regional economy. Cavite and Laguna are homes to various historical sites, such as the Rizal Shrine in Calamba, and the Aguinaldo Shrine in Kawit. San Pablo is famous for its seven lakes, Pagsanjan for its majestic waterfalls and both Taal Lake and the historic Taal town in Batangas. Tayabas is known as the City of Festivals, Rest and Recreation Destination of Quezon and famous for &quot;lambanog&quot;.

The Minor Basilica of Saint Michael Archangel is the religious testaments of the Tayabenses and declared as National Cultural Treasures of the Philippines, the Casa Comunidad de Tayabas, the former office of the then President Manuel Luis Quezon and the place where Hermano Pule was sentenced to death, and the Malagonlong Bridge and the 9 other century-old Spanish arch type and National Cultural Treasure bridges. Local festivals include the Taytsinoy Festival, Mayohan Festival, Pa&#x27;yas Festival Hagisan Festival, Baliskog Festival, Angel Festival, Aguyod Festival and the Turumba Festival every Holy Week.

Lucban is most famous for its annual Pahiyas Festival or locally known as Pahiyas, an event not only visited by local tourists but also by international tourists as well. Devotees and pilgrims also visit Lucban&#x27;s Kamay ni Hesus Shrine, which has a 50-foot statue of the Ascending Christ on top of a hill. Batangas is also famous for its scenic beaches in Nasugbu and Calatagan. Antipolo is another major tourist spot, found in Rizal. The region is also home to a multitude of baroque churches.

Being an industrialized region, Calabarzon is dotted with expressways and highways to serve the people traveling to factories and industries, as well as to accommodate traffic that comes to and from Metro Manila, as it is located just east and south of the region. The Pan-Philippine Highway is an important road that crosses through Laguna, Cavite, Batangas, and Quezon, serving as a gateway to the southern parts of Luzon.

The South Luzon Expressway and Southern Tagalog Arterial Road link the port of Batangas to Metro Manila, while the Cavite–Laguna Expressway and Manila–Cavite Expressway (also known as CAVITEX) seamlessly link industrial towns and cities that dot around Cavite and Laguna. All the aforementioned expressways also help accommodate the inter-modal traffic between Calabarzon and Metro Manila, serving as a faster, more viable alternative compared to primary highways that directly cross municipal and city centers.

The Laguna Lake Highway, a joint project of DPWH NCR and Region IV-A, is the widening/rehabilitation at Taytay, Rizal segment, a 3.34-kilometer road.

Currently, there are two more bridges being built - Barkadahan Bridge and Napindan Bridge - which will provide additional 2 lanes crossing over Manggahan Floodway and Pasig River, respectively.

<text>Ardour is a free and open-source digital audio workstation and hard disk recorder that runs on Linux, macOS, FreeBSD and Microsoft Windows. Its primary author is Paul Davis, who is also responsible for the JACK Audio Connection Kit. Released under the GNU General Public License, it is intended to be suitable for professional use.

== Features ==

=== Recording ===
Ardour&#x27;s recording abilities are limited by only the hardware it is run on; there are no built-in limits on the number of tracks the user can record to. When recording on top of existing media, it can perform latency compensation, positioning recorded material where it was intended to be when recording it. Monitoring options include self-monitoring, external hardware support (dependent on sound card support), and specialized hardware support (e.g. JACK Audio Connection Kit). Self-monitoring makes it possible to apply plug-in effects while recording. Using the JACK audio, Ardour can record concurrently from both the audio card and compatible software.

=== Mixing ===
Ardour supports an arbitrary number of tracks and buses through an &quot;anything to anywhere&quot; routing system. All gain, panning and plug-in parameters can be automated. All sample data is mixed and maintained internally in 32-bit floating point format.

=== Editing ===
Ardour supports dragging, trimming, splitting and time-stretching recorded regions with sample-level resolution, and supports layer regions. It includes a crossfade editor and beat detection, unlimited undo/redo, and a &quot;snapshot&quot; feature for saving the current state of a session to a file.

=== Mastering ===
Ardour can be used as an audio mastering environment. Its integration with the JACK Audio Connection Kit makes it possible to use mastering tools such as JAMin. Its mixer&#x27;s output can be sent to third-party audio processing software for processing and/or recording. It can also export TOC and CUE files for creating audio CDs.

== Compatibility ==
Ardour attempts to adhere to industry standards, such as SMPTE/MTC, Broadcast Wave Format, MIDI Machine Control and XML.

It has been tested on Linux, x86-64, x86, PowerPC and ARM (for at least version 3) architectures; Solaris, macOS on Intel and PowerPC, Windows on Intel architectures and FreeBSD. It takes advantage of all of these systems&#x27; multiprocessor, multicore SMP and real-time features.

Pre-built binaries of Ardour are available for purchase for Linux, macOS and Windows. It is also possible to build Ardour yourself for free from the freely available source code.

=== Plug-ins ===
Ardour relies on plug-ins for many features, from audio effects processing to dynamic control. It supports the following plugin format and platform combinations: LV2 on Linux, FreeBSD, macOS and Windows; Audio Units on macOS; Steinberg&#x27;s VST2 on Linux, macOS and Windows; LADSPA on Linux, FreeBSD, macOS and Windows. It is theoretically possible to use plugins created for Windows in the VST2 format on Linux with the help of Wine, but the project team does not recommend it.
Since version 6.5, it also supports VST3 plugins on all supported platforms. Unlike most modern 64-bit DAW&#x27;s, Ardour does not run 32bit VST&#x27;s natively.

=== Import and export ===
Ardour can import audio clips into sessions from many common audio file formats, including WAV, FLAC, Vorbis, AIFF, CAF, W64, BWF and MP3; SMF files are supported for MIDI import.

Ardour can export whole sessions or parts of sessions, and import audio clips into sessions, using its built-in audio file database manager, or directly from an ordinary file browser.

== Supporting companies and future ==
The SAE Institute provided corporate support for Ardour until February 2009, an initiative for providing a more integrated experience on Mac OS X and the development of a simpler version for students and others new to audio processing.

Solid State Logic employed Paul Davis to work full-time on Ardour during the development of version 2, until the end of 2006.

Harrison Audio has supported the Ardour project since early 2005. Harrison&#x27;s Mixbus DAW, LiveTrax front-of-house multi-track recorder, and their destructive film dubber, the Xdubber, are based on Ardour. Mixbus extends Ardour to add Harrison&#x27;s own proprietary DSP and a more console-like workflow. The Xdubber was a customizable platform for enterprise-class digital audio workstation (DAW) users.

Waves Audio privately supported Ardour development in 2009. It also developed the Waves Track Live software in collaboration with Ardour developers, with most of the source code changes becoming part of Ardour&#x27;s codebase.

<doc id="236841" wikidata="Q372071" url="?curid=236841" title="Probability-generating function">
<text>In probability theory, the probability generating function of a discrete random variable is a power series representation (the generating function) of the probability mass function of the random variable. Probability generating functions are often employed for their succinct description of the sequence of probabilities Pr(&quot;X&quot; = &quot;i&quot;) in the probability mass function for a random variable &quot;X&quot;, and to make available the well-developed theory of power series with non-negative coefficients.

==Definition==

=== Univariate case ===
If &quot;X&quot; is a discrete random variable taking values &quot;x&quot; in the non-negative integers {0,1, ...}, then the &quot;probability generating function&quot; of &quot;X&quot; is defined as
formula_1
where formula_2 is the probability mass function of formula_3. Note that the subscripted notations formula_4 and formula_5 are often used to emphasize that these pertain to a particular random variable formula_3, and to its distribution. The power series converges absolutely at least for all complex numbers formula_7 with formula_8; the radius of convergence being often larger.

=== Multivariate case ===
If is a discrete random variable taking values in the -dimensional non-negative integer lattice , then the &quot;probability generating function&quot; of is defined as
formula_9
where is the probability mass function of . The power series converges absolutely at least for all complex vectors formula_10 with formula_11

==Properties==

===Power series===

Probability generating functions obey all the rules of power series with non-negative coefficients. In particular, formula_12, where formula_13, x approaching 1 from below, since the probabilities must sum to one. So the radius of convergence of any probability generating function must be at least 1, by Abel&#x27;s theorem for power series with non-negative coefficients.

===Probabilities and expectations===

The following properties allow the derivation of various basic quantities related to formula_3:
# The probability mass function of formula_3 is recovered by taking derivatives of formula_16, formula_17
# It follows from Property 1 that if random variables formula_3 and formula_19 have probability-generating functions that are equal, formula_20, then formula_21. That is, if formula_3 and formula_19 have identical probability-generating functions, then they have identical distributions.
# The normalization of the probability mass function can be expressed in terms of the generating function by formula_24 The expectation of formula_3 is given by formula_26 More generally, the formula_27factorial moment, formula_28 of formula_3 is given by formula_30 So the variance of formula_3 is given by formula_32 Finally, the -th raw moment of X is given by formula_33
# formula_34 where &quot;X&quot; is a random variable, formula_35 is the probability generating function (of formula_3) and formula_37 is the moment-generating function (of formula_3).

===Functions of independent random variables===

Probability generating functions are particularly useful for dealing with functions of independent random variables. For example:

* If formula_39 is a sequence of independent (and not necessarily identically distributed) random variables that take on natural-number values, and
formula_40 where the formula_41 are constant natural numbers, then the probability generating function is given by
formula_42
* In particular, if formula_3 and formula_19 are independent random variables:
formula_45 and
formula_46
* In the above, the number formula_47 of independent random variables in the sequence is fixed. Assume formula_47 is discrete random variable taking values on the non-negative integers, which is independent of the formula_49, and consider the probability generating function formula_50. If the formula_49 are not only independent but also identically distributed with common probability generating function formula_52, then
formula_53 This can be seen, using the law of total expectation, as follows:
formula_54
This last fact is useful in the study of Galton–Watson processes and compound Poisson processes.
* When the formula_49 are not supposed identically distributed (but still independent and independent of formula_47), we have
formula_57 where formula_58 For identically distributed formula_49s, this simplifies to the identity stated before, but the general case is sometimes useful to obtain a decomposition of formula_60 by means of generating functions.

==Examples==

* The probability generating function of an almost surely constant random variable, i.e. one with formula_61 and formula_62 is formula_63
* The probability generating function of a binomial random variable, the number of successes in formula_64 trials, with probability formula_2 of success in each trial, is formula_66 Note: it is the formula_64-fold product of the probability generating function of a Bernoulli random variable with parameter formula_2. So the probability generating function of a fair coin, is formula_69
* The probability generating function of a negative binomial random variable on formula_70, the number of failures until the formula_71 success with probability of success in each trial formula_2, is formula_73 which converges for formula_74. Note that this is the formula_75-fold product of the probability generating function of a geometric random variable with parameter formula_76 on formula_77.
* The probability generating function of a Poisson random variable with rate parameter formula_78 is formula_79
==Related concepts==

The probability generating function is an example of a generating function of a sequence: see also formal power series. It is equivalent to, and sometimes called, the z-transform of the probability mass function.

Other generating functions of random variables include the moment-generating function, the characteristic function and the cumulant generating function. The probability generating function is also equivalent to the factorial moment generating function, which as formula_80 can also be considered for continuous and other random variables.

Co-produced by Lennon, his wife Yoko Ono and Phil Spector, the album&#x27;s elaborate sound contrasts the basic, small-group arrangements of his first album, &quot;John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band&quot; (1970). The opening title track is widely considered to be his signature song.

Lennon recorded the album from early to mid-1971 at his Ascot Sound Studios, EMI Recording Studios and the Record Plant in New York City, with musicians that included his ex-Beatles bandmate George Harrison, keyboardist Nicky Hopkins, bassist Klaus Voormann and drummers Alan White and Jim Keltner. The lyrics reflect peace, love, politics, Lennon&#x27;s experience with primal scream therapy and, following a period of high personal tensions, an attack on his former writing partner Paul McCartney in &quot;How Do You Sleep?&quot;. Extensive footage from the sessions was recorded for a scrapped documentary; parts were released on the documentary film &quot;&quot; (1988). The documentary &quot;John &amp; Yoko: Above Us Only Sky&quot;, based on that footage, was released in 2018.

&quot;Imagine&quot; was a critical and commercial success, reaching number one on both the UK Albums Chart and US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Along with &quot;John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band&quot;, it is considered one of Lennon&#x27;s finest solo albums. In 2012, it was voted 80th on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. The album has been reissued several times, including in 2018 as &quot;The Ultimate Collection&quot;, a six-disc box set containing previously unreleased demos, studio outtakes, &quot;evolution documentaries&quot; for each track, and isolated track elements along with surround mixes.

==Background==
While in New York, former Beatles John Lennon and George Harrison had a short jam session, during which Lennon asked Harrison to perform on Lennon&#x27;s next album. Recording was scheduled to begin in a week&#x27;s time at Lennon&#x27;s Ascot Sound Studios, at his Tittenhurst Park residence. Harrison agreed, and invited their friend, bassist Klaus Voormann.

==Recording and structure==
Recording for the album started on 24 May at Ascot Sound Studios. The first songs recorded were &quot;It&#x27;s So Hard&quot; and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Be a Soldier&quot; in February 1971 at Ascot Sound Studios, during sessions for Lennon&#x27;s single &quot;Power to the People&quot;. A cover of the Olympics&#x27; 1958 song &quot;Well (Baby Please Don&#x27;t Go)&quot;, later released on &quot;John Lennon Anthology&quot;, was recorded on 16 February. Lennon chose to remake &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Be a Soldier&quot; on 24 May 1971, the opening day of the main album sessions.

Lennon enlisted help from Nicky Hopkins, members of the Apple band Badfinger, Alan White and Jim Keltner. Harrison contributed lead guitar parts on various songs. Lennon showed the musicians a song that he had recently written, &quot;Imagine&quot;. Also recorded was a demo of the future Lennon track &quot;Aisumasen (I&#x27;m Sorry)&quot;, the unreleased song &quot;San Francisco Bay Blues&quot;, and a demo of &quot;I&#x27;m the Greatest&quot;.

Lennon and his wife Yoko Ono flew to New York on 3 July to continue sessions for the album the next day, at the Record Plant. Many instrumental parts were re-recorded there, and strings and saxophone by King Curtis were also added. The tracks that were finished at Record Plant were &quot;It&#x27;s So Hard&quot;, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Be a Soldier&quot; and &quot;How Do You Sleep?&quot; As on Lennon&#x27;s last album, Phil Spector joined him and Ono as co-producer on &quot;Imagine&quot;. The string arrangements for the album were written by Torrie Zito.

Extensive footage of the sessions, showing the evolution of some of the songs, was originally filmed and titled &quot;Working Class Hero&quot; before being shelved. Footage of &quot;Gimme Some Truth&quot; aired as part of the BBC TV show &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot; on 12 December 1972. Portions were released as part of the documentary film &quot;&quot;.

==Music and lyrics==
&quot;Imagine&quot; was written and recorded during a period of particularly bad feeling between Lennon and former bandmate Paul McCartney, following the Beatles&#x27; break-up the year before and McCartney winning his case in the High Court to have their legal partnership dissolved. Harrison guested on half of &quot;Imagine&quot;&#x27;s ten tracks, including &quot;How Do You Sleep?&quot; – a song written in retaliation against McCartney&#x27;s alleged personal attacks on Lennon and Ono, on his recent &quot;Ram&quot; album. Lennon said in 1980: &quot;I used my resentment against Paul ... to create a song ... not a terrible vicious horrible vendetta ... I used my resentment and withdrawing from Paul and The Beatles, and the relationship with Paul, to write &#x27;How Do You Sleep?&#x27;. I don&#x27;t really go &#x27;round with those thoughts in my head all the time ...&quot;

The track &quot;Imagine&quot; became Lennon&#x27;s signature song and was written as a plea for world peace. Years later he acknowledged Ono&#x27;s role in the song&#x27;s creation and stated his regret that he had not credited her as a co-writer. &quot;Jealous Guy&quot; has also had enduring popularity; it was originally composed as &quot;Child of Nature&quot; during the songwriting sessions in India in 1968 that led to the Beatles&#x27; double album &quot;The Beatles&quot;. &quot;Oh My Love&quot; and the song &quot;How?&quot; were influenced by his experience with primal therapy.

Lennon also indulged his love of rock and roll with &quot;Crippled Inside&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s So Hard&quot;. &quot;Gimme Some Truth&quot;, first heard during the &quot;Let It Be&quot; sessions in early 1969, appears on the album with a new bridge. The politically themed &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Be a Soldier&quot; closes the first half of &quot;Imagine&quot; in a cacophonous manner. The last song on the album was &quot;Oh Yoko!&quot;; EMI pushed for this track to be issued as a single, but Lennon thought it was too &quot;pop&quot;.

==Packaging==
The photographs on the front and back covers were taken by Ono, using a Polaroid camera. It was previously believed that the front cover photo was taken by Andy Warhol. The back cover includes a quote (&quot;Imagine the clouds dripping. Dig a hole in your garden to put them in.&quot;) from Ono&#x27;s book &quot;Grapefruit&quot;, which UK re-release the Lennons were promoting at the time. The album&#x27;s original release also included a poster of Lennon at the piano and two postcards. In lieu of sporting the typical full green apple picture on most Apple record labels, a black and white photograph of Lennon&#x27;s face was presented on Side A instead.

==Release==

Apple Records issued &quot;Imagine&quot; on 9 September 1971 in the United States and a month later, on 8 October, in the UK. Early editions of the LP record included a postcard featuring a photo of Lennon holding a pig, in mockery of McCartney&#x27;s similar pose with a sheep on the cover of &quot;Ram&quot;.

Even though Spector championed a &quot;Back to Mono&quot; aesthetic starting in the 1980s, monophonic sound was out of style in the 1970s. Instead, the album was released in stereo and in the then new four channel quadraphonic technology. In the US, the four channel mix was only available on a quad 8-track tape with some copies marketed as &quot;Quadrasonic&quot;. In the UK and Australia, the quad mix was issued on LP record using CBS&#x27;s SQ matrix system along with a quad 8-track version in the UK. In Japan, the quad mix was issued on LP using the QS Regular Matrix system; and also, a discrete quad reel-to-reel tape.

&quot;Imagine&quot;, backed with &quot;It&#x27;s So Hard&quot;, was released as a single in the US on 11 October 1971. The album went to number one worldwide and became an enduring seller, with the title track reaching number three in the US. &quot;Imagine&quot; was not issued as a single in the UK until four years later, to coincide with the release of Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Shaved Fish&quot; singles collection.

===Promotional film===

In 1972, Lennon and Ono released a 70-minute film to accompany the &quot;Imagine&quot; album which featured footage of them at their Berkshire property at Tittenhurst Park and in New York City. It included many of the tracks from the album and some additional material from Ono&#x27;s 1971 album &quot;Fly&quot;. Several celebrities appeared in the film, including Andy Warhol, Fred Astaire, Jack Palance, Dick Cavett and George Harrison. Derided by critics as &quot;the most expensive home movie of all time&quot;, it premiered to an American audience on TV on 23 December 1972.

==Critical reception==

Reviewing the album for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1971, Ben Gerson said it &quot;contains a substantial portion of good music&quot; but considered Lennon&#x27;s previous LP to be superior. He also warned of the possibility that Lennon&#x27;s &quot;posturings will soon seem not merely dull but irrelevant&quot;. Alan Smith of the &quot;NME&quot; lauded the album as &quot;superb&quot;, &quot;beautiful&quot; and &quot;one step away from the chill of his recent total self-revelation, and yet a giant leap towards commerciality without compromise&quot;. He said it was Lennon &quot;showing McCartney how to tighten up the flab in his music, and its worth&quot;, and concluded: &quot;Lennon rides high!&quot; In &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Roy Hollingworth named &quot;Imagine&quot; the best album of the year and Lennon&#x27;s finest work up to that point.

&quot;Imagine&quot; was voted the fifth best record of 1971 in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Pazz &amp; Jop, an annual poll of American critics nationwide. It was voted &quot;Album of the Year&quot; in polls conducted by Radio Luxembourg and &quot;Record World&quot;.
Robert Christgau, who ranked it fifth in his Pazz &amp; Jop ballot, appraised the album as &quot;primal goes pop – personal and useful&quot; in the 1981 book &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot;.

Reviewing for &quot;Mojo&quot; in 2000, Jon Savage said the preponderance of mid-tempo tracks partly explained the album&#x27;s popularity among Britrock bands, yet this quality made some of the songs drag. He admired Harrison&#x27;s slide guitar playing in the &quot;sinuous and spacy&quot; soundscape, but found that the album &quot;contains both the best and the worst of [Lennon] – the idealist and the ranter, the righteous and the vindictive anger – and as such remains more patchy than its iconic status might allow&quot;. Writing for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine finds the lyrics to be &quot;only marginally less confessional&quot; than on Lennon&#x27;s previous album, adding: &quot;If &quot;Imagine&quot; doesn&#x27;t have the thematic sweep of &quot;Plastic Ono Band&quot;, it is nevertheless a remarkable collection of songs that Lennon would never be able to better again.&quot; 

In 2012, &quot;Imagine&quot; ranked at number 80 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. It dropped to number 223 in the 2020 edition of the list.

==Legacy==
Lennon later expressed his displeasure with the more commercial sound of the album, saying that the title track was &quot;an anti-religious, anti-nationalistic, anti-conventional, anti-capitalistic song, but because it&#x27;s sugar-coated, it&#x27;s accepted&quot;. In a November 1971 interview for &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, McCartney spoke positively of &quot;Imagine&quot;, considering it to be less political than Lennon&#x27;s previous solo albums. In a subsequent edition of the same publication, Lennon rebuked his former bandmate, saying, &quot;So you think &#x27;Imagine&#x27; ain&#x27;t political? It&#x27;s &#x27;Working Class Hero&#x27; with sugar on it for conservatives like yourself!!&quot; and likened McCartney&#x27;s politics to those of the staunchly traditional Mary Whitehouse.

After Lennon&#x27;s death, &quot;Imagine&quot;, along with seven other Lennon albums, was reissued by EMI as part of a box set, which was released in the UK on 15 June 1981. Like its title track, Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Imagine&quot; became a posthumous hit worldwide after his death in December 1980. The album re-entered the charts during 1981, peaking at number three in Norway, five in the United Kingdom, 34 in Sweden, and 63 in the United States. In 2000, Yoko Ono supervised the remixing of &quot;Imagine&quot; for its remastered reissue. In February 2000, the remastered and remixed edition reached number 11 on the Japanese chart. It was reissued in 2003 by Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab on gold CD and on 180 gram half-speed mastered LP. The Record Plant piano on which Lennon re-recorded some of the album&#x27;s keyboard parts was sold at auction in 2007.

In October 2010, another remastered version of the album was released, and the album re-entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number 88. On 23 November 2010, &quot;Imagine&quot; became available on the &quot;Rock Band 3&quot; video game, exploiting the music game&#x27;s use of a keyboard. On Record Store Day 2011, in honour of the album&#x27;s 40th anniversary, it was re-released on 180-gram LP with an additional 12&quot; white LP record entitled &quot;Imagine Sessions&quot;, featuring tracks taken from the &quot;John Lennon Anthology&quot;. In January 2014, the album was released by Universal Music on the High Fidelity Pure Audio Blu-ray format, featuring PCM, DTS HD and Dolby Tru HD audio tracks, based on the 2010 remaster. In 2018, the album was remixed yet again and titled &quot;Imagine: The Ultimate Collection&quot;. A six-disc box set, spread over four CDs and two Blu-ray discs, features previously unheard demos, rare studio outtakes, and isolated track elements along with a 5.1 surround mix and the original four channel quadraphonic mix.

<text>Batangas, officially the Province of Batangas ( ), is a first class province of the Philippines located in the southwestern part of Luzon in the Calabarzon region. Its capital is the city of Batangas, and is bordered by the provinces of Cavite and Laguna to the north, and Quezon to the east. Across the Verde Island Passages to the south is the island of Mindoro and to the west lies the South China Sea. Poetically, Batangas is often referred to by its ancient name, Kumintáng.

The province of Batangas was billed as the second richest province in the Philippines by the Commission on Audit by the year 2020. It has been the second richest province in the country for two consecutive years. In 2020, its provincial government posted a record high of ₱25.2 billion worth of assets, the largest in Calabarzon and the whole Luzon.

Batangas is one of the most popular tourist destinations near Metro Manila. It is home to the well-known Taal Volcano, one of the Decade Volcanoes, and the small nearby town of Taal which keeps ancestral houses, churches, and other architecture dating back to the 19th century. The province also has numerous beaches and diving spots including Anilao in Mabini, Sombrero Island in Tingloy, Ligpo Island and Sampaguita Beach in Bauan, Matabungkay in Lian, Punta Fuego in Nasugbu, the municipality of Calatagan, and Laiya in San Juan. All of the marine waters of the province are part of the Verde Island Passage, the center of the world&#x27;s marine biodiversity.

Batangas City has the second largest international seaport in the Philippines after Metro Manila. The identification of the city as an industrial growth center in the region and being the focal point of the Calabarzon program is seen in the increasing number of business establishments in the city&#x27;s Central Business District (CBD) as well as numerous industries operating in the province&#x27;s industrial parks. Lipa City has passed Batangas City as the most populous city in the province.

==Etymology==
The name Batangas is derived from the term &quot;batangan&quot;, which has two definitions: a log found in the Calumpang River, and rafts used to fish in Taal Lake.

The Batangas dialect of Tagalog closely resembles the Old Tagalog spoken before the arrival of the Spanish. This is why the Summer Institute of Linguistics calls this province the center of the Tagalog language. The strong presence of Tagalog culture is evident to this day.

Batangas also has one of the highest literacy rates in the country at 96.5%, with men having a slightly higher literacy rate at 97.1% compared to women at 95.9%. The combined average literacy rate is 96%.

=== Historical precedents ===
The first recorded name of the province was &quot;Kumintáng&quot;, whose political center was the present-day municipality (town) of Taal, prior to moving to the municipality of Balayan. Balayan was considered the most progressive town of the region. An eruption of Taal Volcano destroyed a significant portion of the town, causing residents to transfer to &quot;Bonbon&quot; (now Taal), the name eventually encompassing the bounds of the modern province.

==History==

=== Early history ===
Large centers of population already thrived along the coasts and rivers of present-day Batangas. Barangays lined the Pansipit River draining Bombon Lake (now Taal), a major waterway. The area was a major site for the Maritime Jade Road, one of the most extensive sea-based trade networks of a single geological material in the prehistoric world, operating for ~3,000 years from ~2000 BCE to ~1000 CE. Trading relations with other Philippine peoples, Borneo, Chinese, Japanese, among others were maintained.

Archaeological findings and written accounts by the Spanish explorers in the mid-16th century show that pre-colonial Tagalogs have long histories in complex, stratified societies with trade networks encompassing Southeast and East Asia. This was shown by certain jewelry, made from a chambered nautilus shell, where tiny holes were created by a drill-like tool. The ancient peoples of present-day Batangas were influenced by trade with Indianized states and to a lesser degree China, as shown in many loanwords from Sanskrit and unearthed tradeware ceramics primarily from China and present-day Vietnam and Thailand. A Buddhist image unearthed in Calatagan was reproduced in mould on a clay medallion in bas-relief. According to experts, the image in the pot strongly resembles the iconographic portrayal of Buddha in Siam, India, and Nepal. The pot shows Buddha Amithāba in the tribhanga pose inside an oval nimbus. Scholars also noted that there is a strong Mahāyānic orientation in the image, since the Boddhisattva Avalokiteśvara was also depicted.

One of the major archaeological finds was in January 1941, where two crude stone figures were found in Palapat, also in Calatagan. They were later donated to the National Museum. One of them was destroyed during World War II.

Eighteen years later, a grave was excavated in nearby Punta Buaya. Pieces of brain coral were carved behind the heads of the 12 remains that were found. The site was named &quot;Likha&quot; (meaning &quot;create&quot;). The remains were accompanied by furniture that could be traced as early as the 14th century. Potteries, as well as bracelets, stoneware, and metal objects were also found in the area, suggesting that the people who lived there had extensive contact with people from as far as China.

The presence of dining utensils such as plates or &quot;chalices&quot; found with the remains also suggest that prehistoric Batangueños believed in the idea of life-after-death. Thus, the Batangueños, like their neighbors in other parts of Asia, have similar customs of burying furniture with the dead.

Like the nearby tribes, the Batangan or the early Batangueños were a non-aggressive people. Partly because most of the tribes in their immediate environment were related to them by blood. Some weapons Batangans used included the &quot;bakyang&quot; (bows and arrows), the &quot;bangkaw&quot; (spears), and the &quot;suwan&quot; (bolo).

Being highly superstitious, the use of &quot;agimat&quot; (amulet or talisman) showed that these people believed in the presence of higher beings and other things unseen. The natives believed that forces of nature were a manifestation these higher beings.

The term &#x27;Tagalog&#x27; may have been derived from the word &quot;taga-ilog&quot; or &quot;river dwellers&quot; referring to the Pasig River located further up north of the region. However, Wang Teh-Ming in his writings on Sino-Filipino relations points out that Batangas was the real center of the Tagalogs, which he then identified as &quot;Ma-yi&quot; or &quot;Ma-i&quot;. According to the Chinese Imperial Annals, Ma-yi had its center in the province and extends to as far as present-day Cavite, Laguna, Rizal, Quezon, Bataan, Bulacan, Mindoro, Marinduque, Nueva Ecija, some parts of Zambales, and Tarlac. However, many historians interchangeably use the term Tagalog and Batangueño.

Henry Otley Beyer, an American archaeologist, also showed in his studies that the early Batangueños had a special affinity with the precious stone known as the jade. He named the Late Paleolithic Period of the Philippines as the &quot;Batangas Period&quot; in recognition of the multitude of jade found in the excavated caves in the province. Beyer identified that the jade-cult reached the province as early as 800 B.C. and lasted until 200 B.C.

=== Precolonial period ===

During the precolonial era, there were many prominent settlements (bayan) in Batangas, including that of Balayan, Bonbon (Taal) and Kumintang. Kumintang was a large polity around the Calumpang River in modern-day Batangas ruled by the legendary figure Gat Pulintan according to local tradition, was the paramount datu in the region who refused to be Christianized continued resistance against Spanish occupation in the hills.

===Spanish colonial period===

In 1570, Spanish generals Martin de Goiti and Juan de Salcedo explored the coast of Batangas on their way to Manila and came upon a settlement at the mouth of Pansipit River. In 1572, the town of Taal was founded and its convent and stone church were constructed later.

Officially, the &quot;Province of Bonbon&quot; was founded by Spain in 1578, through Fr. Estaban Ortiz and Fr. Juan de Porras. It was named after the name that was given to it by the Muslim natives who inhabited the area.

In 1581, the Spanish government abolished Bonbon Province and created a new province which came to be known as Balayan Province. The new province was composed of the present provinces of Batangas, Mindoro, Marinduque, southeast Laguna, southeast Quezon, and Camarines. After the devastating eruption of Taal Volcano in 1754, the old town of &quot;Taal&quot;, present day San Nicolas, was buried. The capital was eventually transferred to Batangas (now a city) for fear of further eruptions where it has remained to date.

In the same years that de Goiti and Salcedo visited the province, the Franciscan missionaries came to Taal, which later became the first Spanish settlement in Batangas and one of the earliest in the Philippines. In 1572, the Augustinians founded Taal in the place of &quot;Wawa&quot;, now San Nicolas, and from there began preaching in Balayan and in all the big settlements around the lake of &quot;Bombon&quot; (Taal). The Augustinians, who were the first missionaries in the diocese, remained until the revolution against Spain. Among the first missionaries were eminent men, which included Alfonso de Albuquerque, Diego Espinas, Juan de Montojo, and others.

During the first ten years, the whole region around the Lake of Bombon was completely Christianized. It was done through the preaching of men who had learned the first rudiments of the language of the people. At the same time, they started writing manuals of devotion in Tagalog, such as novenas, and had written the first Tagalog grammar that served other missionaries who came.

Foundation of important parishes followed throughout the years: 1572, the Taal Parish was founded by the Augustinians; 1581, the Batangas Parish under Fray Diego Mexica; 1596, Bauan Parish administered by the Augustinian missionaries; 1605, Lipa Parish under the Augustinian administration; 1774, Balayan Parish was founded; By the end of the 1700s, Batangas had 15,014 native families and 451 Spanish Filipino families; 1852, Nasugbu Parish was established; and 1868, Lemery Parish too.

The town of Nasugbu became an important centre of trade during the Spanish occupation of the country. It was the site of the first recorded battle between two European Forces in Asia in Fortune Island, Nasugbu, Batangas. In the late part of the 20th century, the inhabitants of Fortune Island discovered a sunken galleon that contained materials sold in the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade.

Batangas was also among the first of the eight Philippine provinces to revolt against Spain and one of the provinces placed under Martial Law by Spanish Governor-General Ramon Blanco on August 30, 1896. This event was given distinction when Marcela Agoncillo, also a native of the province, made the Philippine Flag, which bears a sun with eight rays to represent these eight provinces.

===American colonial era===

When the Americans forbade the Philippine flag from being flown anywhere in the country, Batangas was one of the places where the revolutionaries chose to propagate their propaganda. Many, especially the revolutionary artists, chose Batangas as the place to perform their plays. In an incident recorded by Amelia Bonifacio in her diary, the performance of &quot;Tanikalang Ginto&quot; in the province led not only to the arrest of the company but all of the audience. Later, the play was banned from being shown anywhere in the country.

General Miguel Malvar is recognized as the last Filipino general to surrender to the United States in the Philippine–American War.

=== Japanese occupation ===
After the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the Japanese sent their planes to attack the Philippines, launching major air raids throughout the country. The bombings resulted in the destruction of the Batangas Airport located in Batangas City, of which nothing remains today. Batangas was also a scene of heavy fighting between the Philippine Army Air Corps and the Japanese A6M Zero Fighter Planes. The most notable air combat battle took place at the height of 3,700 metres (12,000 ft) on December 12, 1941, when 6 Filipino fighters led by Capt. Jesús Villamor engaged the numerically superior enemy of 54 Japanese bombers and fighter escorts which raided the Batangas Airfield. Capt. Jesús Villamor won the battle, suffering only one casualty, Lt. César Basa who was able to bail out as his plane was shot down, only to be strafed by the Zeroes.

When Gen. Douglas MacArthur ordered the overall retreat of the American-Filipino Forces to Bataan in 1942, the province was ultimately abandoned and later came under direct Japanese occupation. During this time, the Imperial Japanese Army committed many crimes against civilians including the massacre of 328 people in Bauan, 320 in Taal, 300 in Cuenca, 107 in San Jose, and 39 in Lucero.

==== Liberation ====

As part of the Philippines Campaign (1944–45), the province&#x27;s liberation began on January 31, 1945, when elements of the 11th Airborne Division, part of the U.S. Eighth Army went ashore at Nasugbu, Batangas. However, Batangas was not the main objective of the invasion force. Instead, most of its units headed north to capture Manila, and by March 3, the capital was completely secured.

Liberation of Batangas proper by American forces began in March 1945 by the 11th Airborne Division and the 158th Regimental Combat Team (RCT). The 158th, stationed in Nasugbu, was tasked to secure the shores and nearby towns of Balayan and Batangas. The 11th Airborne, from the Tagaytay Ridge, would attack the Japanese defenses north of Taal Lake and open the Lipa corridor. By March 11 the 158th RCT had reached Batangas City. In order to secure the two bays, the 158th needed to capture the entire Calumpang Peninsula near the town of Mabini, which was still held by some elements of the Japanese 2nd Surface Raiding Base Force. Fighting continued until March 16 when the whole peninsula was finally liberated.

Afterwards, the 158th RCT turned northward to meet the Japanese Fuji Force defenses at Mt. Maculot in Cuenca on March 19. The 158th disengaged from the Japanese on March 23 and were relieved by the 11th Airborne&#x27;s 187th Glider Infantry Regiment. Another 11th Airborne Division task force, the 188th Infantry was ordered to dispatch troops around Batangas City and its remaining frontiers. Meanwhile, the 11th Airborne&#x27;s 511th Parachute Infantry Regiment had begun the opening of the Lipa corridor at Santo Tomas and Tanauan before being relieved by the 1st Cavalry Division and moving via Tagaytay to Bauan and San Jose.
The last major offensive for the capture of the Lipa Corridor began when 188th Infantry Task Force from Batangas City left for Lipa on March 24. The same that day, the 187th Infantry Task Force launched an attack against the remaining Japanese positions in Mt. Maculot. Heavy fighting continued until April 17. The final capture of Mt. Maculot came by April 21.

The 188th Infantry met stiff resistance from Fuji Force&#x27;s 86th Airfield Battalion on March 26. To the north, the 1st Cavalry attacked the remaining Japanese defenses in the towns of Santo Tomas and Tanauan and succeeded in linking up with the advancing 187th and 188th task forces from the south. Lipa was captured by the 1st Cavalry on March 29. The final defeat of the Fuji Force came at Mt. Malepunyo at the hands of the 511th on May 2.

With the capture of Lipa and Mt. Malepunyo, organized resistance ended in the province. Some elements of the 188th Infantry Task Force were left to clear the Batangas mountains located southeast of the province from the remaining Japanese.

Throughout the battle, recognized Filipino guerrilla fighters played an important key role in the advancement of the combined American and Philippine Commonwealth troops, providing key roads and intelligence on the location of Japanese defenses and movements. The 11th Airborne and attached Filipino guerrillas had 390 casualties, of which 90 were killed. The Japanese, however, lost 1,490 men. By the end of April 1945, Batangas was liberated and fully secured under Allied control, thus ending all hostilities.

The movements of the military general headquarters and military camps of the Philippine Commonwealth Army happened from January 3, 1942, to June 30, 1946, and included the province of Batangas. During the engagements of the Anti-Japanese Imperial Military Operations in Manila, southern Luzon, Mindoro, and Palawan from 1942 to 1945, (including the provinces of Rizal, Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Mindoro, and Palawan), units of the Philippine Constabulary, with the local guerrilla resistance joined with the U.S. liberation military forces against the Imperial Japanese armed forces.

Under the Southern Luzon Campaign, local Filipino soldiers of the 4th, 42nd, 43rd, 45th, and 46th Infantry Divisions of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and 4th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary joined the battle for the liberation of Batangas.

===Philippine independence===
After Douglas MacArthur made his famous landing in the Island of Leyte, he came next to the town of Nasugbu to mark the liberation of Luzon. This historic landing is remembered by the people of Batangas every last day of January, a holiday for the Nasugbugueños.

After the United States of America relinquished control of the Philippines, statesmen from Batangas featured prominently in the government. These include the legislators Felipe Agoncillo, Galicano Apacible (who later became the Secretary of Agriculture), Ramon Diokno, Apolinario R. Apacible, Expedito Leviste, Gregorio Katigbak, Teodoro Kalaw, Claro M. Recto, and José Laurel, Jr.

It is also notable that when President Manuel L. Quezon left the Philippines during the Japanese Occupation, the Japanese government in the Philippines chose the Batangueño José Laurel, Sr. to be the president of the Japanese-sponsored Second Philippine Republic.

=== Under the Marcos Presidency ===
Batangueños were not spared the social and economic turmoil that began during the second term of President Ferdinand Marcos, including his 1971 suspension of the writ of habeas corpus, his 1972 declaration of martial law, and his continued hold on power from the lifting of martial law in 1981 until his ouster under the People Power Revolution of 1986.

Prominent Batangueño Senator Jose W. Diokno was one of the first people Marcos imprisoned without charges, because according to then-Defense Secretary Juan Ponce Enrile, the regime found it necessary to &quot;emasculate the voices of the opposition.&quot;

In 1981, Marcos used his Presidential “power of eminent domain” to convert 167 hectares of agricultural lands in San Rafael, Calaca, for industrial use, paving the way for the construction of the Semirara Calaca power plant regardless of its health and environmental impact.

Among the later victims of the regime were student leaders Ismael Umali, Noel Clarete, and Aurelio Magpantay from Western Philippine Colleges in Batangas City, along with their friend Ronilo &quot;Nilo&quot; Evangelio of the Justice for Aquino, Justice for All (JAJA) chapter in Batangas. The four who disappeared after a protest rally in March 1984, and their mangled bodies were later discovered abandoned in nearby Cavite province.

=== Contemporary ===
After the ouster of Ferdinand Marcos and the creation of the Fifth Philippine Republic, numerous Batanguenos took up prominent positions in government - most prominently Salvador Laurel, who became Vice President of the Philippines under the first Aquino administration, and Renato Corona, who became Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines.

== Geography ==


Batangas&#x27; landscape is largely of plains dotted by mountains, including one of the world&#x27;s smallest volcanoes, Mt. Taal, with an elevation of , located in the middle of the Taal Lake. Other important peaks are Mount Macolod with an elevation of , Mt. Banoy with , Mt. Talamitam with , Mt. Pico de Loro with , Mt. Batulao with , Mt. Manabo with , and Mt. Daguldol with .

Batangas has several islands, including Tingloy, Verde Island (&quot;Isla Verde&quot;), and Fortune Island of Nasugbu.

According to Guinness World Records, the &quot;largest island in a lake on an island&quot; is situated in Batangas (particularly at Vulcan Point in Crater Lake, which rests in the middle of Taal Island in Lake Taal, on the island of Luzon).

=== Flora and fauna ===

The &quot;malabayabas&quot;, or Philippine teak, is endemic to Batangas. The province is also home to the &quot;kabag&quot; (&quot;Haplonycteris fischeri&quot;), one of the world&#x27;s smallest fruit bats. In the municipality of Nasugbu, wild deer still inhabit the remote areas of barangays Looc, Papaya, Bulihan, and Dayap.

In the second half of 2006, scientists from the United States discovered that the Coral Triangle has its centre at the Isla Verde Passage, a part of the province. According to the study made by American marine biologist Kent Carpenter, Batangas seas host more than half of the world&#x27;s species of coral. It is also home to dolphins and once in a while, the passage of the world&#x27;s biggest fish: the whale shark or the &quot;butanding&quot;, as the locals call it may be observed. The municipality of San Juan has a resident marine turtle or &quot;pawikan&quot;. Pawikans like the Olive ridley sea turtle, leather back sea turtle, and green sea turtle can be seen in Nasugbu up to the present.

=== Administrative divisions ===
Batangas comprises 29 municipalities and 5 cities. In land terms, Nasugbu is the largest municipality in Batangas with over 278.51km² while San Nicolas is the smallest municipality with 22.61 km². In population density, Taal is the most densely populated with over 2,066 people per km² but Lobo is the least densely populated with over 230 people per km².



===Climate===
Batangas falls under two climates: the tropical savanna climate (&quot;As&quot;/&quot;Aw&quot;) and the bordering tropical monsoon climate (&quot;Am&quot;), under the Köppen climate classification. The same geographical divide is also labelled as Type I and Type III, respectively, under the PAGASA climate classification. Most of the province belongs to the tropical former, with well-defined dry and wet seasons, while parts lying to the east belong to the latter, with unpronounced dry and wet seasons influenced by the monsoons. Batangas City, the provincial capital, belongs to the tropical savanna climate, but is strongly influenced by the bordering monsoon climate, characterized by short dry seasons and longer wet seasons. Typhoons are a periodic occurrence especially during the southwest monsoon (&quot;habagat&quot;).

The population of Batangas in the 2020 census was 2,908,494 people, with a density of .

Tagalogs are the predominant people in Batangas, being the native settlers in the province, distantly followed by Bicolanos, Visayans, Kapampangans, Pangasinenses, and Ilocanos, as well as Maguindanaons, Maranaos, Tausugs and other ethnolinguistic groups from Mindanao.

Batangas also has one of the highest literacy rates in the country at 96.5%, with males having a slightly higher literacy rate at 97.1% than females with 95.9%. Combined average literacy rate is 96%.

=== Language ===
The dialect of Tagalog spoken in the province closely resembles the Old Tagalog spoken before the arrival of the Spanish. Hence, the Summer Institute of Linguistics called this province the heartland of the Tagalog language. A strong presence of the Tagalog culture is visible up to the present day. Many educated Batangueños speak a version of Tagalog from the Spanish colonial era but with English terms, as in modern Filipino or standard Tagalog, because of mass media and modern versions of the Tagalog Bible.

Linguistically, Batangueños are also known for their unique affectation of often placing the particles &quot;eh&quot; or &quot;ga&quot; (equivalent to the particle &quot;ba&quot; in Filipino), usually as a marker of stress on the sentence, at the end of their spoken sentences or speech; for example: &quot;Ay, oo nga, eh!&quot; (&quot;Aye, yes, indeed!&quot;). Some even prolong the particle &#x27;eh&#x27; into &#x27;ala eh&#x27;, though this has no meaning in itself.

English is widely understood in the province. Spanish is also understood to some extent, especially by older-generation people in the towns of Nasugbu, Taal, and Lemery, which still have Spanish-speaking minorities. Bicolano, Kapampangan, Ilocano, Visayan, Maguindanaon, Maranao and Tausug are also spoken by a minority due to the influx of migrants from the Bicol Region, Ilocos Region, Cordillera Administrative Region, Cagayan Valley, Central Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao.

== Economy ==

The province of Batangas was billed as the second richest province in the Philippines by the Commission on Audit by year 2020. It has been the second richest province in the country for two consecutive years. In 2020, its provincial government posted a record high of ₱25.2 billion worth of assets, the largest in Calabarzon and the whole Luzon.

=== Products ===

Batangas is known for its butterfly knives, locally known as &quot;balisong&quot;, with its manufacture also becoming an industry in the province.

===Agriculture and fisheries===

Pineapples are also common in Batangas. Aside from the fruit, the leaves are also useful such that an industry has been created from it. Pineapple leaves fibers are processed to form a silk-like fabric known as piña, from which the barong tagalog, the national costume of the Philippines is made.

Livestock as an industry also thrives in Batangas. The term &quot;bakang Batangas&quot; (literally &quot;Batangas cow&quot;) is associated with the country&#x27;s best species of cattle, and are widely sought throughout the country. Cattle raising is widely practiced in Batangas such that every Saturday is an auction day in the municipalities of San Juan, Bauan and Padre Garcia.

Fishing plays a very important part of the economy of the province. Although the tuna industry in the country is centered in General Santos, Batangas is also known for the smaller species of the said fish. The locals even have their own names for it. Some of them are bigeye tuna (&quot;tambakol&quot;), yellowfin tuna (&quot;berberabe&quot;), &quot;tambakulis&quot;, Pacific bluefin tuna (&quot;tulingan&quot;), bullet tuna (&quot;bonito&quot;) and another species also called &quot;bonito&quot; but actually Gymnosarda unicolor. There is also an important industry for the wahoo (&quot;tanigi&quot;).

Aside from the South China Sea, Taal Lake also provides a source of freshwater fishes to the country. The lake is home to &quot;Sardinella tawilis&quot; or simply &quot;tawilis&quot;, a species of freshwater sardine that is endemic to the lake. Taal Lake also provides farmed &quot;Chanos chanos&quot; or &quot;bangus&quot;. There is also a good volume of &quot;Oreochromis niloticus niloticus&quot; and &quot;Oreochromis aureus&quot;, both locally called &quot;tilapia&quot;. It is ecologically important to note that neither &quot;bangus&quot; nor &quot;tilapia&quot; are native to the lake, and are considered an invasive species.

Sugar is also a major industry. After Hacienda Luisita, the country&#x27;s former largest sugar producer, was broken-up for land reform, the municipality of Nasugbu has been the home of the current largest sugar producing company, the Central Azucarera de Don Pedro. Rice cakes and sweets are also a strong industry.

Some towns (those adjacent to Laguna) have a prosperous bamboo based industry, where several houses and furniture are made of bamboo. Natives say that food cooked in bamboo has an added scent and flavor. &quot;Labong&quot;, or bamboo shoots, is cooked with coconut milk or with other ingredients to make a Batangas delicacy.

===Industries===
Batangas houses 5 industrial parks registered under the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA), which are concentrated along the route of STAR Tollway and Jose P. Laurel Highway. The largest of those industrial parks are LIMA Technology Center, a commercial and industrial zone oriented to tech companies at Lipa and Malvar, and the First Philippine Industrial Park (FPIP), with over at Santo Tomas and Tanauan, and Light Industry and Science Park IV (LISP IV), a live-work community with 170-hectare industrial area located at the heart of Malvar, Batangas.

Batangas City and the nearby municipalities of San Pascual, Bauan, and Mabini also have large-scale industrial activity connected with their seaside location, including power generation, oil and gas processing and transhipment, and ship repairs.

== Government ==
With the provinces in the island of Panay, Ilocos Sur and Pampanga, Batangas was one of the earliest provinces established by the Spaniards who settled in the country. It was headed by Martin de Goiti and since then has become one of the most important regions of the Philippines. Batangas first came to be known as &quot;Bonbon&quot;. It was named after Taal Lake, which was also originally called Bonbon. Some of the earliest settlements in Batangas were established in the vicinity of Taal Lake. In 1534, Batangas became the first practically organized province in Luzon. Balayan was the capital of the province for 135 years from 1597 to 1732. In 1732, it was moved to Taal, then the flourishing and most progressive town in the province, it wasn&#x27;t until 1754 that the capital was destroyed by the Great Taal Eruption of 1754. It was in 1889 that the capital was moved to the present, Batangas City.

Batangas has been called by some Philippine historians as the &quot;Cradle of Noble Heroes&quot;, citing the notable number of people from it who were declared Philippine national heroes and those who became leaders of the country. Among them are Teodoro M. Kalaw, Apolinario Mabini, Jose Laurel, and Felipe Agoncillo.

===Transportation===

====Roads====
Batangas has a total of of national roads, mostly paved. The Southern Tagalog Arterial Road (STAR Tollway, officially numbered E2), Maharlika Highway (N1 and AH26) and Jose P. Laurel Highway (N4) forms the highway backbone of the province, and a network of secondary and tertiary national roads links most of the municipalities. The provincial government maintains a network of provincial roads to supplement the national roads and connect municipalities and barangays not connected directly to the main highway network.

Batangas Laguna Tayabas Bus Company Incorporated (BLTBCo.) is one of the oldest bus transport companies in the Philippines has routes within Southern Tagalog region. The company has historical roots in Batangas and has been founded in 1918. At present, the routes have been incorporated with Del Monte Land Transport Bus Company (DLTBCo).

The Cavite-Tagaytay-Batangas (CTBEX) is a proposed expressway from the municipality of Silang, Cavite up to the town of Nasugbu. CTBEX is to connect with the Cavite–Laguna Expressway (CALAEX). Once opened, this will provide motorists a faster route to the resort towns of Nasugbu, Lian and Calatagan in the western part of the province.

====Water transport====

Batangas Port in Batangas City is the principal port for ferry access to Mindoro, Tablas, Romblon, and other islands. Montenegro Lines is the largest of a number of passenger shipping companies operating out of Batangas. Condensate tankers offload at Batangas in sizeable quantity. Batangas Port is expanded in 2008 to house facilities for container ships.

Being an entry point to the rest of the archipelago, Batangas has roll-on/roll-off (RoRo) ferry connections with Mindoro and Visayas. The western portion of the Nautical Highway starts at Batangas, and connects with Calapan, Oriental Mindoro. Batangas Port serves as another principal port, along with the Manila International Port for inter-island and international cargo shipping, as well as interisland passenger shipping.

===Electricity===


Electric power in Batangas is mostly distributed by electric cooperatives, namely the Batangas I Electric Cooperative (BATELEC-I) and Batangas II Electric Cooperative (BATELEC-II). The former serves the western part of Batangas, like Nasugbu, Calatagan, Balayan, Lemery, and Taal, while the latter serves the eastern part, like Lipa, Tanauan, Talisay, San Jose, and Rosario. The municipalities of Bauan and Ibaan, and LIMA Technology Center are served by local utility companies. Santo Tomas, the First Philippine Industrial Park (FPIP) in Tanauan, San Pascual and Batangas City, however, are served by the Metro Manila-based electric company, Meralco. Some large industrial customers are supplied by the 69,000 volt grid, operated by National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP), BATELEC-II, and Meralco.

Batangas houses three power plants that provide the bulk of power used in Luzon. Power plants include the 600-megawatt (MW) Calaca Coal Fired Power Plant in Calaca, the 500 MW, 1000 MW, and 414 MW San Lorenzo-Santa Rita-San Gabriel Combined Cycle Power Plant, and the 1251 MW Ilijan Power Plant, both in Batangas City. The Calaca Power Plant is originally built with nameplate capacity of 600 MW, is being expanded to generate 1300 MW, with an addition of 2x350 MW (700 MW) capacity in a second power plant, constructed under an agreement between Semirara Mining and Meralco.

Most power plants in Batangas, however, use fossil fuels, such as coal and natural gas, and are the subjects of environmental grievances because of their effects on ecosystems. One power plant to be built at Mabacong, Batangas City, is facing opposition from environmentalists and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lipa, owing to its effect on residents and the aquatic ecosystem on Verde Island Passage.

== Culture ==
===Way of life===
Maria Kalaw Katigbak, a Filipino historian, was quoted to call the Batangueños the &quot;Hybrid-Tagalogs&quot;. One particular custom in the Batangas culture is the so-called &quot;Matanda sa Dugo&quot; (lit. &quot;older by blood&quot;) practice wherein one expresses respect not because of age but because of consanguinity. During the early times, the custom of having very large families were very common. Thus, a particular person&#x27;s uncle could be of the same age, or even younger than himself. Because of the custom, the older person would still address the younger one with an honorary title such as &quot;tiyo&quot;/&quot;tio&quot; or simply &quot;kuya&quot; if they can no longer establish the actual relationship or add the honorific &quot;ho&quot; / &quot;po&quot; in their sentences when addressing the younger instead of the other way around. This often draws confusion from the other provinces who are not accustomed to such practices. This practice exists until today.

Batangueños are very &quot;regionalistic&quot;. When one learns that another in the room is also from Batangas, the two would be together until the end of the event. In workplace settings, a Batangueno may also express preference for another Batangueno as long as the workplace regulations allow. Thus, the running joke on the &quot;Batangas Mafia&quot;.

Batangueños are also known for high-toned conversations that seemingly sound like a heated argument to non-Batangueños but in fact, they are not always the case, as they are just normal conversations.

They also tend to live in a large extended family. It has been observed that a piece of land remains undivided until the family connection becomes too difficult to establish actual blood relations. Marriages between relatives of the fifth generation is still restrained in the Batangan culture even if Philippine laws allow it.

Batangueños have been known for their religious practices, where devotees of the Catholic religion perform rituals such as dances (subli) and chants (luwa/lua) to express their faith. One of these is the ritual called &quot;Pasión&quot;/&quot;Pasyon&quot; based on the passion of Jesus Christ in which religious chants are recited during the Lenten season. In May, the people of Bauan and Alitagtag celebrate the feast day of the &quot;Mahal na Poon ng Santa Cruz&quot; (lit. Lord of the Holy Cross), a ritual dance called the Subli is made to honor the Poon. In the town of Taal, they celebrate the feast day of Our Lady of Caysasay and San Martin de Tours a two-day celebration where a procession begins from the shrine of the Virgin going towards the Pansipit River from which the fluvial procession and another procession towards the Basilica are made in honor of the Virgin Mary. Fiestas in other towns usually start in the month of May and last up to the first day of June, usually the plaza near the church becomes the center of activities.

=== Mythology and literature ===

Scholars also identified that the ancient Batangueños, like the rest of the Tagalogs, worship the Supreme Creator, known as Bathala. Lesser gods like Mayari, the goddess of the moon and her honorary brother Apolake, god of the sun, were also present. Dambana practices are also present in the province.

For literature, Padre Vicente Garcia came to be known when he wrote an essay to defend José Rizal&#x27;s Noli Me Tangere.

In 2004, the province of Batangas gave Domingo Landicho (familiarly called Inggo by Batangueños) who was born in the province the &quot;Dangal ng Batangas&quot; (Pride of Batangas) Award for being the &quot;Peoples&#x27; Poet&quot;.

=== Art ===

==== Music ====
Musicologists identified Batangas as the origin of the &quot;kumintang&quot;, an ancient war song, which later evolved to become the signature of Filipino love songs the &quot;kundiman&quot;. From the ancient kumintang, another vocal music emerged, identified as the &quot;awit&quot;. The &quot;huluna&quot;, a psalm-like lullaby, is also famous in some towns, especially Bauan.

During the Lenten Season, the Christian passion-narrative, called &quot;Pasyon&quot; by the natives, is expected in every corners of the province. In fact according to scholars, the very first printed version of the pasyon was authored by a layman from Rosario named Gaspar Aquino de Belen. Although de Belen&#x27;s version was printed in 1702, it is still debated whether there were earlier versions.

Debates may also be done while singing. Batangueños are known for the &quot;duplo&quot; (a sung debate where each line of the verse must be octosyllabic) and the &quot;karagatan&quot; (a sung debate where each line of the verse must be dodecasyllabic.) The latter, whose literal meaning is &quot;ocean&quot;, got its name from the opening lines. Always, the karagatan is opened by saying some verses that alludes the depth of the sea and comparing it to the difficulty of joining the debate. And as mentioned above, the debate must be sung.

Batangas is also the origin of the &quot;balitao&quot;. Aside from being a form of vocal music, the &quot;balitao&quot; is also a form of dance music. Together with the &quot;subli&quot;, it is the most famous form of dance native to Batangas.

==== Architecture and sculpture ====

As shown in its ancient churches, Batangas is home to some of the best preserved colonial architectures in the country, especially evident in the municipality of Taal.

Though not as popular as the carving industry of Paete, Taal is still known for the sculptures engraved in furniture. Sometimes, altar tables coming from Taal were called the &quot;friars&#x27; choice&quot;.

According to Milagros Covarubias-Jamir, another Filipino scholar, the furniture that came from Taal during the colonial times was comparable to equivalent quality furniture from China. The build of the furniture was so exquisite, nails of glues were never used. Still, the Batangueños knew how to maximize the use of hardwoods. As a result, furniture made about a hundred years ago are still found in many old churches and houses even today.

<text>Madurai Shanmukhavadivu Subbulakshmi (16 September 1916 – 11 December 2004) was an Indian Carnatic singer. She was the first musician ever to be awarded the Bharat Ratna, India&#x27;s highest civilian honour and also the first Indian musician to receive the Ramon Magsaysay award in 1974. She was the first Indian to perform at the United Nations General Assembly in 1966.

== Biography ==

=== Early years ===
Subbulakshmi (Kunjamma to her family) was born on 16 September 1916 in Madurai, Madras Presidency, to veena player Shanmukavadiver Ammal and Subramania Iyer. Her grandmother Akkammal was a violinist.

She started learning Carnatic music at an early age and trained in Carnatic music under the tutelage of Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer and subsequently in Hindustani music under Pandit Narayanrao Vyas.

Her mother, from the devadasi community, was a music exponent and a regular stage performer, and Subbulakshmi grew up in an environment very conducive to musical learning. Her musical interests were also shaped by regular interactions with Karaikudi Sambasiva Iyer, Mazhavarayanendal Subbarama Bhagavathar and Ariyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar.

Subbulakshmi gave her first public performance, at the age of eleven, in the year 1927, in the 100-pillar hall inside the Rockfort Temple, Tiruchirappalli; with Mysore Chowdiah on the violin and Dakshinamurthy Pillai on the mridangam. This was organised by the Tiruchirappalli-based Indian National Congress leader F. G. Natesa Iyer.

=== Move to Madras ===
In 1936 Subbulakshmi moved to Madras (now Chennai). She also made her film debut in &quot;Sevasadan&quot; in 1938. Her debut to the world of cinema was again opposite F. G. Natesa Iyer.

== Musical style and performance ==
=== Singing career ===

M.S. Subbulakshmi began her Carnatic classical music training under her mother Shanmukhavadivu; and later in Hindustani classical training under Pandit Narayan Rao Vyas. Subbulakshmi first recording was released when she was 10 years old.

Subbalakshmi gave her first performance at the prestigious Madras Music Academy in 1929, when she was 13 years old. The performance consisted of singing bhajans (Hindu hymns). The academy was known for its discriminating selection process, and they broke tradition by inviting a young girl as a key performer. Her performance was described as spellbinding and earned her many admirers and the moniker of musical genius from critics. Soon after her debut performances, Subbulakshmi became one of the leading Carnatic vocalists.

By the age of seventeen, Subbulakshmi was giving concerts on her own, including major performances at the Madras Music Academy.

She travelled to London, New York, Canada, the Far East, and other places as India&#x27;s cultural ambassador. Her concerts at Edinburgh International Festival of Music and Drama in 1963; Carnegie Hall, New York; the UN General Assembly on UN day in 1966; Royal Albert Hall, London in 1982; and Festival of India in Moscow in 1987 were significant landmarks in her career.

In 1969 she was accompanied by Indian Railways Advisor SN Venkata Rao to Rameswaram, where she sang several songs in front of each idol in the Ramanathaswamy Temple. She shared a very cordial relation with Sree Ramaseva Mandali at Bengaluru for whom she performed 36 concerts.

After the death of her husband Kalki Sadasivam in 1997, she stopped all her public performances. Her last performance was in 1997, before her retirement from public concerts.

M. S. Subbulakshmi died on 11 December 2004, at her home in Kotturpuram, Chennai.

=== Films ===
M.S. also acted in a few Tamil films in her youth. Her first movie, &quot;Sevasadanam&quot;, was released on 2 May 1938. F.G. Natesa Iyer was the lead actor, opposite Subbulakshmi, in this film, directed by K. Subramanyam. It was a critical and commercial success. Ananda Vikatan favourably reviewed the film on 8 May 1938:
Sevasadanam is one of the early Tamil films to be set in a contemporary social setting and to advocate reformist social policies. The film is an adapted version of Premchand&#x27;s novel &quot;Bazaar-e-Husn&quot;. Veteran Marxist leader N. Sankaraiah, has described Sevasadanam as an &quot;unusual film&quot; for choosing the subject of marriages between young girls and old men (which had social sanction). According to him, the film successfully broughtout the &quot;sufferings of the girl&quot; (Subbalakshmi) and the &quot;mental agony of the aged husband&quot; (F.G. Natesa Iyer). Tamil film critic and historian Aranthai Narayanan observes in his book, &quot;Thamizh Cinemavin Kathai&quot; (The Story of Tamil Cinema) that &quot;Seva Sadhanam proved a turning point in the history of Tamil cinema. In the climax, the aged husband, now a totally changed man, was shown as casting aside with utter contempt his &#x27;sacred thread&#x27;, which symbolises his Brahmin superiority. It came as a stunning blow to the then Brahmin orthodoxy.&quot;

MS Subbulakshmi also played the male role of Narada in &quot;Savitri&quot; (1941) to raise money for launching &quot;Kalki&quot;, her husband&#x27;s nationalist Tamil weekly. Her title role of the Rajasthani saint-poetess Meera in the eponymous 1945 film gave her national prominence. This movie was re-made in Hindi in 1947.

== Filmography ==
== Awards and honours ==
Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru had this to say about M.S. Subbulakshmi- &quot;Who am I, a mere Prime Minister before a Queen, a Queen of Music&quot;. While Lata Mangeshkar called her &quot;Tapaswini&quot; (the Renunciate), Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan termed her &quot;Suswaralakshmi&quot; (the goddess of the perfect note), and Kishori Amonkar labelled her the ultimate eighth note or &quot;Aathuvaan Sur&quot;, which is above the seven notes basic to all music. The great national leader and poet Sarojini Naidu called her &quot;Nightingale of India&quot;. Her many famous renditions of bhajans include the chanting of Meenakshi Pancharatnam, Bhaja Govindam, Vishnu sahasranama (1000 names of Vishnu), Hari Tuma Haro and the Venkateswara Suprabhatam (musical hymns to awaken Lord Balaji early in the morning).

She was widely honoured, praised and awarded. Some of the popular ones include:
* Padma Bhushan in 1954
* Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in 1956
* Sangita Kalanidhi in 1968
* Ramon Magsaysay Award (often considered Asia&#x27;s Nobel Prize) in 1974
* Padma Vibhushan in 1975
* Sangeetha Kalasikhamani in 1975 by The Indian Fine Arts Society, Chennai
* Kalidas Samman in 1988
* Indira Gandhi Award for National Integration in 1990
* Bharat Ratna in 1998

She was honoured as a resident artist Asthana Vidhwan of Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams. Tirupati Urban Development Authority (TUDA) has installed a bronze statue of M.S. Subbulakshmi at the Poornakumbham circle in the temple town. It was unveiled by Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy on 28 May 2006.

The Kancheepuram Saree shade known as MS Blue was named after her by the well-known Congress party member and philanthropist, Sri Muthu Chettiyar when they met at the residence of Sri R. Aiyadurai and Smt. Thangam Aiyadurai at Lady Desikachari Road, Madras, who were close friends of MS and Sadasivam.

A commemorative postage stamp on her was issued on 18-December-2005. United Nations decided to issue the stamp to mark the birth centenary of M.S. Subbulakshmi. She was bestowed with enormous prize money along with the awards, most of which she donated to charity. She has given more than 200 charity concerts and raised well over Rs. 10,000,000. She was awarded honorary degrees from several Universities. She was an ardent devotee of Kanchi Mahaswamigal and she rendered his composition &quot;Maithreem Bhajatha&quot; (O World! Cultivate peace) in her concert at the UN in 1966. She made a 20-minute recording of &quot;Venkatesa Suprabhatam&quot; for HMV, the royalty from which goes to the Veda Patasala run by the Tirupati Tirumala Devasthanam. She donated many of the royalties on several best sold records to many charity organisations.

<text>The FAMAS (French: &quot;Fusil d&#x27;Assaut de la Manufacture d&#x27;Armes de Saint-Étienne&quot;, &#x27;Assault rifle from the Saint-Étienne Weapon Factory&#x27;) is a bullpup assault rifle designed and manufactured in France by MAS in 1978. It is known by French troops as &quot;Le Clairon&quot; (The Bugle) due to its distinctive shape.

The FAMAS is known for its high rate of fire of around 900–1,100 rounds per minute.

Beginning in 2017, the FAMAS was replaced in most frontline units in the French Army by the HK416F, and the FAMAS is expected to remain in limited service until 2028.

==History==
The first French bullpup rifles were developed between 1946 and 1950 at the AME (&quot;Atelier Mécanique de Mulhouse&quot;) and MAS, testing rounds such as .30 US Carbine, 7.92×33mm Kurz, 7.65×38mm (Made by &quot;Cartoucherie de Valence&quot;) and some other intermediate calibres. Since France was engaged in the First Indochina War at the time, and was also the second-largest contributor to NATO, the research budgets for new types of weapons were limited and priority was given to the modernisation and production of existing service weapons. Nevertheless, approximately forty different 7.62×51mm NATO calibre prototype rifles were developed between 1952 and 1962, most notably the FA-MAS Type 62. However, the United States adoption of the M16 rifle and 5.56×45mm cartridge caused the French to rethink their approach, and consequently the Type 62 was not adopted.

In the 1960s, MAS began to manufacture under licence the Heckler &amp; Koch G3 battle rifle and later on the Heckler &amp; Koch HK33 assault rifle as temporary substitutes. At the same time, the French embraced the idea of developing a new 5.56 mm automatic rifle. However, adopting the German-designed HK33 was considered unsatisfactory for many members of the French high command. General Marcel Bigeard was also against the idea of relying on foreign weapons; while visiting the Manufacture d&#x27;Armes de Saint-Étienne, he asked the engineers to develop a homemade French 5.56 mm automatic rifle, which subsequently led to the creation and adoption of the FAMAS.

The FAMAS project began in 1967 under the direction of General Paul Tellié (1919-2014) and the first prototype was completed in 1971, with French military evaluation of the rifle beginning in 1972. When production problems delayed the general issue of the new rifles, and with the 1978 Battle of Kolwezi showing an immediate need for a more modern weapon to be comparable with the assault rifles of enemy forces, the French Army began searching for an emergency temporary rifle until the FAMAS came into full production.

While the Heckler &amp; Koch HK33 was considered, with a batch of 1,200 examples tested, it was ultimately turned down in favour of the SIG SG 540, made under licence by Manurhin (&quot;Manufacture de Machines du Haut Rhin&quot;) as a temporary resort, until enough domestically-built FAMAS were produced to issue to French forces. In late 1978, the French military accepted the FAMAS as their standard-issue rifle, the FAMAS F1.

=== Service ===
The FAMAS first saw service in Chad during Operation Manta and again in desert operations during Operation Desert Storm and in other various missions. Officially, operational conditions proved the weapon to be reliable and trustworthy under combat conditions. The FAMAS is affectionately known by French-speaking troops as &quot;le Clairon&quot; (&quot;the Bugle&quot;) because of its shape.

Senegal and the United Arab Emirates received a small number of FAMAS F1 rifles from France, though it was unknown when they received them. Djibouti uses this weapon in its military and the gendarmerie as the standard infantry weapon. The Philippines also received a limited number and is used by the Philippine National Police Special Action Force.

=== Replacement ===

In 2017, the French armed forces began the retirement of the FAMAS in favour of the German-made HK416.

When the Manufacture d&#x27;Armes de Saint-Etienne (MAS) factory closed in 2002, no more domestic rifles could be made. The last batch of newly produced FAMAS, built in 2002, saw more than a decade of heavy service by 2016. As of 2014, the French armed forces currently use an estimated 400,000 FAMAS F1 and G2 rifles still stored in their arsenal. The military also ceased manufacture of special steel-case ammunition for the FAMAS. Because the FAMAS did not function properly with NATO standard brass-cased ammunition (chamber fluting can allow the F1 to use brass cases but only G2 rifles can use common STANAG magazines), and coupled with concern over the age of existing weapons, the French military sought a replacement for the FAMAS. 

In May 2014, the French Ministry of Armed Forces announced a European Union-wide tender for a minimum of 90,000 rifles and carbines to be issued across the entire French armed forces. In August 2016, the Ministry selected Heckler and Koch&#x27;s HK416 to replace the FAMAS as the new general-issue service rifle. Under the contract, the new rifle was designated as the HK416F, with &#x27;F&#x27; standing for French version. 16,000 rifles will be annually purchased until a final total of 90,000 to 102,000 rifles are delivered. The new rifles are expected to remain in active French service for at least 30 years.

The FAMAS will be issued to the French National Guard and domestic police units, and will continue to serve in reserve and non-combat units until 2028, when a phaseout of the FAMAS with the HK416 can occur.

==Design details==
===Action===

The FAMAS is a bullpup assault rifle, where the ammunition feed is behind the trigger. The receiver housing is made of a special steel alloy, and the rifle furniture is made of fiberglass. The rifle uses a lever-delayed blowback action, an action type also used in the French AA-52 machine gun derived from the prototypes built during Army Technical Department tests having taken place between the First and Second World Wars.

===Ergonomics===

Fire mode is controlled by a selector within the trigger guard, with three settings: safe (central position), single shot (to the right), and automatic fire (to the left). Automatic fire can be in three-shot bursts (&quot;rafale&quot;) or fully automatic; this is determined by another selector, located under the housing and behind the magazine.

The FAMAS G2 weighs . The G1 and G2 have a large, grip-length trigger-guard like that of the Steyr AUG to allow easy access to the trigger when wearing gloves.

Both F1 and G2 models of the FAMAS feature a bipod attached to the upper hand-guard.

The FAMAS-G2 and some F1 sport a &quot;polyvalent hand-guard&quot; which features a standard NATO Accessory Rail, allowing a variety of sights to be mounted, notably red dot sights and night vision units.

===Ammunition===
The FAMAS uses a delayed blowback operating system that functions best with French-specified steel-casing 5.56×45mm ammunition. Using standard brass-casing 5.56×45mm NATO ammunition employed by other armies can create over-pressure and case ruptures in the FAMAS during extraction, which can lead to severe malfunctions. Using incorrectly built ammunition also results in approximately two minor injuries for every million rounds fired from a FAMAS. As a result, the French military has discreetly banned the use of foreign-produced ammunition in all French-issued FAMAS. However, fluting the chamber will completely remove these malfunctions, although the brass casings will still be deformed and will not be able to be reloaded without reshaping.

The FAMAS F1 uses a proprietary 25-round magazine. It has a chrome-lined barrel with 1 turn in 12 inch (1:12 inch) rifling and functions best with the (M193 type) ammunition. When using the French made 5.56 mm ammo it has a muzzle velocity of .

The FAMAS G2 uses M16-type, NATO-compatible 30-round STANAG magazines. It has a chrome-lined barrel with 1 turn in 9 inch (1:9 inch) rifling and functions equally well with both the older (M193 type) ammo and the newer (SS109 type) ammo. When using the French made 5.56 mm ammo it has a muzzle velocity of .

During training with blank ammunition, a special plug is added to the muzzle of the FAMAS. This plug is necessary for automatic or semi-automatic blank fire operation, and functions by blocking part of the gas used in a blank cartridge.

===Rifle grenades===
The FAMAS can use a variety of rifle grenades up to . Notable examples include the antipersonnel APAV40 and the anti-tank AC58.

The FAMAS features two alidades for aiming rifle grenades with several modes:
* direct fire at , in anti-vehicle role
* indirect fire, in anti-personnel role:
** with the FAMAS inclined by 45°, allowing fire from 
** with the FAMAS inclined by 75°, allowing fire from 
In indirect fire mode the grenade support (more exactly named &quot;grenade enforcement ring&quot; in French) is moved forwards or backwards on the barrel which has markings (12/13?). This changes the position of the grenade on the barrel and automatically the volume of the chamber in which the gas expands to push the grenade forward. Each position of the grenade support has a number which is multiplied by a certain fixed number depending on the alidade position, 45° or 75°; this will accurately indicate the firing distance of the grenade.

The FAMAS can also accommodate an external grenade launcher as an add-on module under the hand guard; the US M203 grenade launcher is sometimes used.

== Variants ==
===FAMAS F1===
After adoption by the French military, the FAMAS F1 replaced both the aging MAS 49/56 rifle and MAT-49 submachine gun. Approximately 400,000 FAMAS F1 assault rifles were produced by MAS. While a capable rifle, the F1 had numerous problems to overcome. For instance, many plastic pieces on the rifle easily broke, including critical parts like the cheek riser. The FAMAS was also susceptible to malfunction on occasion due to poorly built, or rather improperly used, magazines. The FAMAS was designed around the concept of single-use, disposable magazines; when the limited budget of the French military forced soldiers to repeatedly reuse the disposable magazines, the FAMAS would experience malfunctions. MAS would eventually manufacture more durable magazines for the FAMAS that improved reliability.

=== FAMAS G1 ===
The F1 was followed by the G1 version that included several minor improvements, such as redesigned grips and an enlarged trigger guard for operation with gloves. However, the G1 remained conceptual and was never actually produced.

===FAMAS G2===

The FAMAS G2 was developed in 1994 to comply with NATO standards by accepting standard NATO magazines and by employing tighter barrel rifling to accurately fire both older 5.56 mm ammunition and new standard 5.56×45mm NATO ammunition. The ammunition specific lever-delayed blowback mechanism of the FAMAS F1 designed around French steel cased ammunition was slightly revised for reliably using 5.56×45mm NATO ammunition. The FAMAS G2 also included several other upgrades taken from the G1 model, such as an enlarged trigger guard and improved hand guards made from reinforced fiberglass instead of plastic, and also the ability to take standard brass cased ammunition as well as French made steel ammunition. The French Navy purchased the FAMAS G2 in 1995 and issued it to their Fusiliers Marins and Commandos Marine. However, the French army refused to purchase the G2, preferring to rely on the FAMAS F1 as their primary rifle.

===FAMAS Infantry===
The FAMAS Infantry is an improvement of the FAMAS F1, obtained by retrofitting an accessory rail onto the top of the handguard. This allows mounting combat optics, most notably reflex sights or the 4×26.4 SCROME J4 telescopic sight.

=== FAMAS FÉLIN ===
The FAMAS FÉLIN was developed from the G2 as part of the Infantryman programme with integrated equipment and links (FÉLIN)

An improved version of the FAMAS F1 is integrated in the Félin system.

=== FAMAS Valorisé ===
A FAMAS F1 whose carry handle has been replaced by the new version intended for the FAMAS Félin, lowered and originally equipped with 2 Picatinny rails. In addition, the bipod joint has been moved back about ten centimetres and each foot is now bent in 2 points forward, so that in the folded position they do not interfere with the ejection of empty cases.

===FAMAS Commando===
The FAMAS Commando was a short-barrelled version of the FAMAS G2 for international exports, with a barrel length of 285mm (11.2 in) without the integrated bipod. Prototypes of the weapon differ, with different iron sights and ergonomics. The FAMAS saw no international interest and only initial prototypes of the Commando exist and solely kept by the French Ministry of the Interior.

<doc id="236849" wikidata="Q205258" url="?curid=236849" title="Interest rate swap">
<text>In finance, an interest rate [[swap (finance)|swap]] (IRS) is an interest rate derivative (IRD). It involves exchange of interest rates between two parties. In particular it is a &quot;linear&quot; IRD and one of the most liquid, benchmark products. It has associations with forward rate agreements (FRAs), and with zero coupon swaps (ZCSs).

In its December 2014 statistics release, the Bank for International Settlements reported that interest rate swaps were the largest component of the global OTC derivative market, representing 60%, with the notional amount outstanding in OTC interest rate swaps of $381 trillion, and the gross market value of $14 trillion.

Interest rate swaps can be traded as an index through the FTSE MTIRS Index.

==Interest rate swaps==
===General description===

An interest rate swap&#x27;s (IRS&#x27;s) effective description is a derivative contract, agreed between two counterparties, which specifies the nature of an exchange of payments benchmarked against an interest rate index. 
The most common IRS is a fixed for floating swap, whereby one party will make payments to the other based on an initially agreed fixed rate of interest, to receive back payments based on a floating interest rate index. 
Each of these series of payments is termed a &quot;leg&quot;, so a typical IRS has both a fixed and a floating leg. 
The floating index is commonly an interbank offered rate (IBOR) of specific tenor in the appropriate currency of the IRS, for example LIBOR in GBP, EURIBOR in EUR, or STIBOR in SEK.

To completely determine any IRS a number of parameters must be specified for each leg:
*the notional principal amount (or varying notional schedule); 
*the start and end dates, value-, trade- and settlement dates, and date scheduling (date rolling); 
*the fixed rate (i.e. &quot;swap rate&quot;, sometimes quoted as a &quot;swap spread&quot; over a benchmark); 
*the chosen floating interest rate index tenor; 
*the day count conventions for interest calculations.

Each currency has its own standard market conventions regarding the frequency of payments, the day count conventions and the end-of-month rule.

===Extended description===

As OTC instruments, interest rate swaps (IRSs) can be customised in a number of ways and can be structured to meet the specific needs of the counterparties. 
For example: payment dates could be irregular, the notional of the swap could be amortized over time, reset dates (or fixing dates) of the floating rate could be irregular, mandatory break clauses may be inserted into the contract, etc. 
A common form of customisation is often present in new issue swaps where the fixed leg cashflows are designed to replicate those cashflows received as the coupons on a purchased bond. 
The interbank market, however, only has a few standardised types.

There is no consensus on the scope of naming convention for different types of IRS. 
Even a wide description of IRS contracts only includes those whose legs are denominated in the same currency. 
It is generally accepted that swaps of similar nature whose legs are denominated in different currencies are called cross currency basis swaps. 
Swaps which are determined on a floating rate index in one currency but whose payments are denominated in another currency are called Quantos.

In traditional interest rate derivative terminology an IRS is a fixed leg versus floating leg derivative contract referencing an IBOR as the floating leg. 
If the floating leg is redefined to be an overnight index, such as EONIA, SONIA, FFOIS, etc. then this type of swap is generally referred to as an overnight indexed swap (OIS). 
Some financial literature may classify OISs as a subset of IRSs and other literature may recognise a distinct separation.

Fixed leg versus fixed leg swaps are rare, and generally constitute a form of specialised loan agreement.

Float leg versus float leg swaps are much more common. These are typically termed (single currency) basis swaps (SBSs). The legs on SBSs will necessarily be different interest indexes, such as 1M LIBOR, 3M LIBOR, 6M LIBOR, SONIA, etc. The pricing of these swaps requires a spread often quoted in basis points to be added to one of the floating legs in order to satisfy value equivalence.

===Uses===
Interest rate swaps are used to hedge against or speculate on changes in interest rates. They are also used to manage cashflows by converting floating to fixed interest payments, or vice versa.

Interest rate swaps are also used speculatively by hedge funds or other investors who expect a change in interest rates or the relationships between them. Traditionally, fixed income investors who expected rates to fall would purchase cash bonds, whose value increased as rates fell. Today, investors with a similar view could enter a floating-for-fixed interest rate swap; as rates fall, investors would pay a lower floating rate in exchange for the same fixed rate.

Interest rate swaps are also popular for the arbitrage opportunities they provide. Varying levels of creditworthiness means that there is often a positive quality spread differential that allows both parties to benefit from an interest rate swap.

The interest rate swap market in USD is closely linked to the Eurodollar futures market which trades among others at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

==Valuation and pricing==
IRSs are bespoke financial products whose customisation can include changes to payment dates, notional changes (such as those in amortised IRSs), accrual period adjustment and calculation convention changes (such as a day count convention of 30/360E to ACT/360 or ACT/365).

A vanilla IRS is the term used for standardised IRSs. Typically these will have none of the above customisations, and instead exhibit constant notional throughout, implied payment and accrual dates and benchmark calculation conventions by currency. A vanilla IRS is also characterised by one leg being &quot;fixed&quot; and the second leg &quot;floating&quot; referencing an index. The net present value (PV) of a vanilla IRS can be computed by determining the PV of each fixed leg and floating leg separately and summing. For pricing a mid-market IRS the underlying principle is that the two legs must have the same value initially; see further under Rational pricing.

Calculating the fixed leg requires discounting all of the known cashflows by an appropriate discount factor:

:formula_1
where formula_2 is the notional, formula_3 is the fixed rate, formula_4 is the number of payments, formula_5 is the decimalised day count fraction of the accrual in the i&#x27;th period, and formula_6 is the discount factor associated with the payment date of the i&#x27;th period.

Calculating the floating leg is a similar process replacing the fixed rate with forecast index rates:
:formula_7
where formula_8 is the number of payments of the floating leg and formula_9 are the forecast index rates of the appropriate currency.

The PV of the IRS from the perspective of receiving the fixed leg is then:
:formula_10

Historically IRSs were valued using discount factors derived from the same curve used to forecast the rates (i.e. the erstwhile reference rates). This has been called &quot;self-discounted&quot;. Some early literature described some incoherence introduced by that approach and multiple banks were using different techniques to reduce them. It became more apparent with the 2007–2008 financial crisis that the approach was not appropriate, and alignment towards discount factors associated with physical collateral of the IRSs was needed.

Post crisis, to accommodate credit risk, the now-standard pricing approach is the multi-curve framework, applied where forecast discount factors and (see below re MRRs) exhibit disparity. 
Note that the economic pricing principle is unchanged: leg values are still identical at initiation. See Financial economics § Derivative pricing for further context. 
Here, overnight index swap (OIS) rates are typically used to derive discount factors, since that index is the standard inclusion on Credit Support Annexes (CSAs) to determine the rate of interest payable on collateral for IRS contracts. As regards the rates forecast, since the basis spread between LIBOR rates of different maturities widened during the crisis, forecast curves are generally constructed for each LIBOR tenor used in floating rate derivative legs.

Regarding the curve build, see: 

Under the old framework a single self-discounted curve was &quot;bootstrapped&quot; for each tenor; 
i.e.: solved such that it exactly returned the observed prices of selected instruments—IRSs, with FRAs in the short end—with the build proceeding sequentially, date-wise, through these instruments. 
Under the new framework, the various curves are best fitted to observed market prices—as a &quot;curve set&quot;—one curve for discounting, one for each IBOR-tenor &quot;forecast curve&quot;,
and the build is then based on quotes for IRSs &quot;and&quot; OISs, with FRAs included as before.
Here, since the observed average overnight rate plus a spread is swapped for the rate over the same period (the most liquid tenor in that market), and the IRSs are in turn discounted on the OIS curve, the problem entails a nonlinear system, where all curve points are solved at once, and specialized iterative methods are usually employed — very often a modification of Newton&#x27;s method. 
The forecast-curves for other tenors can be solved in a &quot;second stage&quot;, bootstrap-style, with discounting on the now-solved OIS curve.

Under both frameworks, the following apply. 
(i) Maturities for which rates are solved directly are referred to as &quot;pillar points&quot;, these correspond to the input-instrument maturities; other rates are interpolated, often using (monotone) Hermitic splines.
(ii) The objective function: prices must be &quot;exactly&quot; returned, as described. 
(iii) The penalty function will weigh: that forward rates are positive, with the curve then likely arbitrage free, and (secondarily) curve &quot;smoothness&quot;; both, in turn, a function of the interpolation method.

(iv) The initial estimate: usually, the most recently solved curve set.
((v) All that need be stored are the solved spot rates for the pillar points, and the interpolation rule.)

A CSA could allow for collateral, and hence interest payments on that collateral, in any currency. 
To accommodate this, banks include in their curve-set a USD discount-curve to be used for discounting trades which have USD collateral; this curve is sometimes called the (Dollar) &quot;basis-curve&quot;. 
It is built by solving for observed (mark-to-market) cross-currency swap rates, where the local is swapped for USD LIBOR with USD collateral as underpin. 
The latest, pre-solved USD-LIBOR-curve is therefore an (external) element of the curve-set, and the basis-curve is then solved in the &quot;third stage&quot;. 
Each currency&#x27;s curve-set will thus include a local-currency discount-curve and its USD discounting basis-curve. 
As required, a third-currency discount curve — i.e. for local trades collateralized in a currency other than local or USD (or any other combination) — can then be constructed from the local-currency basis-curve and third-currency basis-curve, combined via an arbitrage relationship known here as &quot;FX Forward Invariance&quot;.

Starting in 2021, LIBOR is being phased out, with replacements including other &quot;market reference rates&quot; (MRRs) such as SOFR and TONAR (These MRRs are based on secured overnight funding transactions). 
With the coexistence of &quot;old&quot; and &quot;new&quot; rates in the market, multi-curve and OIS curve &quot;management&quot; is necessary, with changes required to incorporate new discounting and compounding conventions, while the underlying logic is unaffected; see.

The complexities of modern curvesets mean that there may not be discount factors available for a specific index curve. These curves are known as &#x27;forecast only&#x27; curves and only contain the information of a forecast index rate for any future date. Some designs constructed with a discount based methodology mean forecast -IBOR index rates are implied by the discount factors inherent to that curve:
:formula_11 where formula_12 and formula_13 are the start and end &quot;discount factors&quot; associated with the relevant forward curve of a particular index in a given currency.

To price the mid-market or par rate, formula_14 of an IRS (defined by the value of fixed rate formula_3 that gives a net PV of zero), the above formula is re-arranged to:
:formula_16

In the event old methodologies are applied the discount factors formula_17 can be replaced with the self discounted values formula_18 and the above reduces to:
:formula_19

In both cases, the PV of a general swap can be expressed exactly with the following intuitive formula:formula_20 
where formula_21 is the so-called Annuity factor formula_22 (or formula_23 for self-discounting). This shows that the PV of an IRS is roughly linear in the swap par rate (though small non-linearities arise from the co-dependency of the swap rate with the discount factors in the Annuity sum).

==Risks==
Interest rate swaps expose traders and institutions to various categories of financial risk: predominantly market risk - specifically interest rate risk - and credit risk. Reputation risks also exist. The mis-selling of swaps, over-exposure of municipalities to derivative contracts, and IBOR manipulation are examples of high-profile cases where trading interest rate swaps has led to a loss of reputation and fines by regulators.

As regards market risk, during the swap&#x27;s life, both the discounting factors and the forward rates change, and thus, per the above valuation techniques, the PV of a swap will deviate from its initial value. The swap will therefore at times be an asset to one party and a liability to the other. (The way these changes in value are reported is the subject of IAS 39 for jurisdictions following IFRS, and FAS 133 for U.S. GAAP.) In market terminology, the first-order link of swap value to interest rates is referred to as delta risk; their gamma risk reflects how delta risk changes as market interest rates fluctuate (see Greeks (finance)). Other specific types of market risk that interest rate swaps have exposure to are basis risks — where various IBOR tenor indexes can deviate from one another — and reset risks - where the publication of specific tenor IBOR indexes are subject to daily fluctuation.

Uncollateralised interest rate swaps — those executed bilaterally without a CSA in place — expose the trading counterparties to funding risks and counterparty credit risks. Funding risks because the value of the swap might deviate to become so negative that it is unaffordable and cannot be funded. Credit risks because the respective counterparty, for whom the value of the swap is positive, will be concerned about the opposing counterparty defaulting on its obligations. Collateralised interest rate swaps, on the other hand, expose the users to collateral risks: here, depending upon the terms of the CSA, the type of posted collateral that is permitted might become more or less expensive due to other extraneous market movements. Credit and funding risks still exist for collateralised trades but to a much lesser extent. Regardless, due to regulations set out in the Basel III Regulatory Frameworks, trading interest rate derivatives commands a capital usage. The consequence of this is that, dependent upon their specific nature, interest rate swaps might command a high capital usage, possibly sensitive to market movements. Capital risks are thus another concern for users, and Banks typically calculate a credit valuation adjustment, CVA - as well as XVA for other risks - which then incorporate these risks into the instrument value.

Debt security traders, daily mark to market their swap positions so as to &quot;visualize their inventory&quot; (see product control). 
As required, they will attempt to hedge, both to protect value and to reduce volatility. Since the cash flows of component swaps offset each other, traders will implement this hedging on a net basis for entire books. Here, the trader would typically hedge her interest rate risk through offsetting Treasuries (either spot or futures).
For credit risks – which will not typically offset – traders estimate: 
for each counterparty the probability of default using models such as Jarrow–Turnbull and KMV, or by stripping these from CDS prices; 
and then for each trade, the potential future exposure and expected exposure to the counterparty. 
Credit derivatives will then be purchased as appropriate. 
Often, a specialized XVA-desk centrally monitors and manages overall CVA and XVA exposure and capital, and will then implement this hedge.
The other risks must be managed systematically, sometimes involving group treasury.

These processes will all rely on well-designed numerical risk models: both to measure and forecast the (overall) change in value, and to suggest reliable offsetting benchmark trades which may be used to mitigate risks. Note, however, (and re P&amp;L Attribution) that the multi-curve framework adds complexity in that (individual) positions are (potentially) affected by numerous instruments not obviously related.

==Quotation and market-making==
=== ICE Swap rate ===
ICE Swap rate replaced the rate formerly known as ISDAFIX in 2015. Swap Rate benchmark rates are calculated using eligible prices and volumes for specified interest rate derivative products. The prices are provided by trading venues in accordance with a “Waterfall” Methodology. The first level of the Waterfall (“Level 1”) uses eligible, executable prices and volumes provided by regulated, electronic, trading venues. Multiple, randomised snapshots of market data are taken during a short window before calculation. This enhances the benchmark&#x27;s robustness and reliability by protecting against attempted manipulation and temporary aberrations in the underlying market.

===Market-making===
The market-making of IRSs is an involved process involving multiple tasks; curve construction with reference to interbank markets, individual derivative contract pricing, risk management of credit, cash and capital. The cross disciplines required include quantitative analysis and mathematical expertise, disciplined and organized approach towards profits and losses, and coherent psychological and subjective assessment of financial market information and price-taker analysis. The time sensitive nature of markets also creates a pressurized environment.

<text>A conflict of interest (COI) is a situation in which a person or organization is involved in multiple , financial or otherwise, and serving one interest could involve working against another. Typically, this relates to situations in which the personal interest of an individual or organization might adversely affect a duty owed to make decisions for the benefit of a third party.

An &quot;interest&quot; is a commitment, obligation, duty or goal associated with a specific social role or practice. By definition, a &quot;conflict of interest&quot; occurs if, within a particular decision-making context, an individual is subject to two coexisting interests that are in direct conflict with each other (&quot;competing interests&quot;). Such a matter is of importance because under such circumstances the decision-making process can be disrupted or compromised in a manner that affects the integrity or the reliability of the outcomes.

Typically, a conflict of interest arises when an individual finds themselves occupying two social roles simultaneously which generate opposing benefits or loyalties. The interests involved can be or non-pecuniary. The existence of such conflicts is an objective fact, not a state of mind, and does not in itself indicate any lapse or moral error. However, especially where a decision is being taken in a fiduciary context, it is important that the contending interests be clearly identified and the process for separating them is rigorously established. Typically, this will involve the conflicted individual either giving up one of the conflicting roles or else recusing themselves from the particular decision-making process in question.

The presence of a conflict of interest is independent of the occurrence of inappropriateness. Therefore, a conflict of interest can be discovered and voluntarily defused before any corruption occurs. A conflict of interest exists if the circumstances are reasonably believed (on the basis of past experience and objective evidence) to create a risk that a decision &quot;may&quot; be unduly influenced by other, secondary interests, and not on whether a particular individual &quot;is actually&quot; influenced by a secondary interest.

A widely used definition is: &quot;A conflict of interest is a set of circumstances that creates a risk that professional judgement or actions regarding a primary interest will be unduly influenced by a secondary interest.&quot; &quot;Primary interest&quot; refers to the principal goals of the profession or activity, such as the protection of clients, the health of patients, the integrity of research, and the duties of public officers. &quot;Secondary interest&quot; includes personal benefit and is not limited to only financial gain but also such motives as the desire for professional advancement, or the wish to do favours for family and friends. These secondary interests are not treated as wrong in and of themselves, but become objectionable when they are believed to have greater weight than the primary interests. Conflict of interest rules in the public sphere mainly focus on financial relationships since they are relatively more objective, fungible, and quantifiable, and usually involve the political, legal, and medical fields.

==In the practice of law==

Conflicts of interest have been described as the most pervasive issue facing modern lawyers. Legal conflicts rules are at their core corollaries to a lawyer&#x27;s two basic fiduciary duties: (1) the duty of loyalty and (2) the duty to preserve client confidences. The lawyer&#x27;s duty of loyalty is fundamental to the attorney-client relationship and has developed from the biblical maxim that no person can serve more than one master. Just as fundamental is the lawyer&#x27;s duty to maintain client confidences, which protects clients&#x27; legitimate expectations that they can make full disclosure of all facts to their attorneys without fear of exposure.

The basic formulation of the conflicts of interest rule is that a conflict exists &quot;if there is a substantial risk that the lawyer&#x27;s representation of the client would be materially and adversely affected by the lawyer&#x27;s own interests or by the lawyer&#x27;s duties to another current client, a former client, or a third person.&quot; The duty of loyalty requires an attorney not to act directly adverse to an existing client, even on an unrelated matter where the lawyer has no client confidences. Such a loyalty conflict has been labeled a &quot;concurrent&quot; conflict of interest. The duty of confidentiality is protected in rules prohibiting so-called &quot;successive&quot; conflicts of interest, when a lawyer proposes to act adversely to the interests of a former client. A lawyer who has formerly represented a client in a matter is precluded from representing another person in the same or a substantially related matter that is materially adverse to the former client. These two basic formulations – that a lawyer may not act directly adverse to a current client or adverse to a former client on a substantially related matter – form the cornerstone of modern legal conflicts of interest rules.

=== Concurrent conflicts of interest ===

==== Direct adversity to current client ====
An attorney owes the client undivided loyalty. The courts have described this principle as &quot;integral to the nature of an attorney&#x27;s duty.&quot; Without undivided loyalty, irreparable damage may be done &quot;to the existing client&#x27;s sense of trust and security – features essential to the effective functioning of the fiduciary relationship…&quot; A key feature of the duty of loyalty is that an attorney may not act directly adverse to a current client or represent a litigation adversary of the client in an unrelated matter. The damage done is to the client&#x27;s confidence that the lawyer is serving their interests faithfully. An example of a lawyer acting directly adverse to a client is when the lawyer sues the client. At the other end of the spectrum is when a lawyer represents business competitors of the client who are not adverse to it in a lawsuit or negotiation. Representing business competitors of a client in unrelated matters does not constitute direct adversity nor give rise to a loyalty conflict. As one state bar ethics committee has noted:
Direct adversity may arise in litigation when an attorney sues a client or defends an adversary in an action their client has brought. It may also arise in the context of business negotiations, when a lawyer negotiates on behalf of an adversary against a current client, even if the matter is unrelated to any matter the lawyer is handling for the client. However, merely advocating opposite sides of the same legal issue does not give rise to direct adversity. Even if a lawyer&#x27;s advocacy in an unrelated matter may make unfavorable law for another client, such effects are only indirect and not subject to the conflicts rules. There is no conflict in advocating positions that may turn out to be unfavorable to another client so long as the lawyer is not directly litigating or negotiating against that client.

===== Identity of the client - corporations =====
One of the most frequently arising questions in corporate practice is whether parent corporations and their subsidiaries are to be treated as the same or different entities for conflicts purposes. The first authority to rule on this question was the California State Bar Ethics Committee, which issued a formal opinion ruling that parent corporations and their subsidiaries are to be considered distinct entities for conflicts purposes. The California committee considered a situation where an attorney undertook a representation directly adverse to the wholly owned subsidiary of a client, when the lawyer did not represent the subsidiary. Relying on the entity as client framework in Model Rule 1.13, the California committee opined that there was no conflict as long as the parent and subsidiary did not have a &quot;sufficient unity of interests.&quot; The committee announced the following standard for evaluating the separateness of parent and subsidiary:

As one commentator has noted, &quot;For a state ethics opinion, California Opinion 1989-113 has been unusually influential, both with courts there, with ethics committees elsewhere, and through the latter set of ethics committee opinions, with… recent decisions in other jurisdictions.&quot; The California opinion has been followed by ethics committees in such jurisdictions as New York, Illinois and the District of Columbia, and served as the basis of ABA Formal Ethics Opinion 95-390. The law in most jurisdictions is that parent corporations and their subsidiaries are treated as distinct entities, except in limited circumstances noted by the California ethics committee where they have a unity of interests.

The Second Circuit has adopted a variation of the California standard. In &quot;GSI Commerce Solutions, Inc. v. BabyCenter LLC,&quot; the court ruled that parent corporations and their subsidiaries should be treated as the same entity for conflicts purposes when both companies rely &quot;on the same in-house legal department to handle their legal affairs.&quot; However, the court ruled that the lawyer and client can contract around this default standard. The court quoted with approval the opinion of the City of New York Committee on Professional and Judicial Ethics, which stated, &quot;corporate family conflicts may be averted by ... an engagement letter ... that delineates which affiliates, if any, of a corporate client the law firm represents...&quot;

=====Material limitation conflicts=====
A concurrent conflict will also exist when &quot;there is a significant risk that the representation of one or more clients will be materially limited by the lawyer&#x27;s responsibilities to another client, a former client or a third person or by a personal interest of the lawyer.&quot; Comment 8 to Model Rule 1.7 states, by way of example, that an attorney representing multiple persons forming a joint venture may be materially limited in recommending the courses of action that any jointly represented client may take because of the lawyer&#x27;s duty to the other participants in the joint venture.

The Supreme Court of Minnesota found a material limitation conflict in &quot;In re Petition for Disciplinary Action Against Christopher Thomas Kalla.&quot; In &quot;Kalla,&quot; an attorney was disciplined for representing a borrower bringing suit against her lender for charging a usurious interest rate while simultaneously representing the mortgage broker who arranged the loan as a third-party defendant in the same lawsuit. Although neither client had brought an action against the other, the court found a material limitation conflict: &quot;Advocating for Client A would potentially harm Client B, who was potentially liable for contribution. Kalla&#x27;s ability to fully advocate for both was materially limited by Kalla&#x27;s dual representation.&quot;

==== Consent to concurrent conflicts of interest ====

===== Consent to current conflicts =====
A concurrent conflict of interest may be resolved if four conditions are met. They are:

# the lawyer reasonably believes that the lawyer will be able to provide competent and diligent representation to each affected client;
# the representation is not prohibited by law;
# the representation does not involve the assertion of a claim by one client against another client represented by the lawyer in the same litigation or other proceeding before a tribunal; and
# each affected client gives informed consent, confirmed in writing.

Informed consent requires that each affected client be fully advised about the material ways that the representation could adversely affect that client. In joint representations, the information provided should include the interests of the lawyer and other affected clients, the courses of action that could be foreclosed due to the joint representation, the potential danger that the client&#x27;s confidential information might be disclosed, and the potential consequences if the lawyer had to withdraw at a later stage in the proceedings. Merely telling the client that there are conflicts, without further explanation, is not adequate disclosure. The lawyer must fully disclose the potential impairment to the lawyer&#x27;s loyalty and explain how another unconflicted attorney might better serve the client&#x27;s interests.

===== Prospective consent to future conflicts =====
It is not unusual in the current legal environment of large multinational and global law firms for the firms to seek advance or prospective waivers of future conflicts from their clients. A law firm is particularly likely to seek a prospective waiver when a large corporation seeks the specialized knowledge of the firm in a small matter, without a high likelihood of repeat business. As the ABA stated in its Ethics Opinion 93-372:

Prospective waivers are most likely to be upheld by the courts when they are given by sophisticated corporate clients represented by independent counsel in the negotiation of the waiver. However, in &quot;Sheppard, Mullin, Richter &amp; Hampton, LLP v. J-M Manufacturing Co.&quot;, the California Supreme Court held that a prospective waiver that did not make specific disclosure of an actual current conflict was not effective to waive that conflict. As the court said,

The &quot;Sheppard Mullin&quot; case does not invalidate prospective waivers in California. It only holds that waivers of current and actual conflicts must specifically disclose those conflicts, an unremarkable conclusion.

===== The hot potato doctrine =====
If a client will not consent to a conflict and allow a lawyer to take on another representation, the lawyer cannot then withdraw from the existing representation, thus turning the existing client into a former client and ending the duty of loyalty. As the courts have stated, the lawyer cannot &quot;drop a client like a hot potato&quot; to cure a conflict. This label has stuck, and the doctrine is now aptly called the &quot;hot potato&quot; doctrine. However, as one commentator has pointed out, the reasoning underlying this line of cases has been sparse, and few courts have attempted to justify this result through an analysis of the ethics rules. The unstated rationale behind the Hot Potato doctrine is that a withdrawal attempted without good cause under Model Rule 1.16(b) is an ineffective withdrawal, which does not successfully terminate the existing attorney-client relationship. When viewed in this light, a withdrawal accomplished with good cause should be an effective withdrawal that does permit a lawyer to take on a representation that would otherwise be conflicting, as long as there is no substantial relationship with the prior matter. The standard used to assess conflicts involving such former clients will be discussed in the next section.

==== Successive conflicts of interest ====

===== The substantial relationship test =====
Conflicts of interest rules involving former clients are primarily designed to enforce the attorney&#x27;s duty to preserve a client&#x27;s confidential information. Model Rule 1.9(a) sets forth this doctrine in a rule that has come to be known as the substantial relationship test. The rule states:

Without the substantial relationship test, a client attempting to prove that its former lawyer possesses its confidential information might have to disclose publicly the very confidential information it is trying to protect. The substantial relationship test was designed to protect against such disclosures. Under this test, the attorney&#x27;s possession of the former client&#x27;s confidential information is presumed if &quot;confidential information material to the current dispute would normally have been imparted to the attorney by virtue of the nature of the former representation.&quot; The substantial relationship test reconstructs whether confidential information was likely to be imparted by the former client to the lawyer by analyzing &quot;the similarities between the two factual situations, the legal questions posed, and the nature and extent of the attorney&#x27;s involvement with the cases.&quot;

===== Imputation of conflicts =====
The conflicts of an individual lawyer are imputed to all attorneys who &quot;are associated with that lawyer in rendering legal services to others through a law partnership, professional corporation, sole proprietorship, or similar association.&quot; This imputation of conflicts can lead to difficulties when attorneys from one law firm leave and join another firm. The issue then arises whether the conflicts of the itinerant lawyer&#x27;s former firm are imputed to their new firm.

In &quot;Kirk v. First American Title Co.,&quot; the court ruled that an itinerant lawyer&#x27;s conflicts are not imputed to their new law firm if that firm timely sets up an effective ethics screen preventing the lawyers from imparting any confidential information to the lawyers in the new firm. An effective ethics screen rebuts the presumption that the itinerant lawyers shared confidential information with the lawyers in the new firm. The components of an effective ethics screen, as described by the court in &quot;Kirk,&quot; are:

# physical, geographic, and departmental separation of attorneys;
# prohibitions against and sanctions for discussing confidential matters;
# established rules and procedures preventing access to confidential information and files;
# procedures preventing a disqualified attorney from sharing in the profits from the representation;
# continuing education in professional responsibility.
Judicial disqualification, also referred to as &quot;recusal&quot;, refers to the act of abstaining from participation in an official action such as a court case/legal proceeding due to a conflict of interest of the presiding court official or administrative officer. Applicable statutes or canons of ethics may provide standards for recusal in a given proceeding or matter. Providing that the judge or presiding officer must be free from disabling conflicts of interest makes the fairness of the proceedings less likely to be questioned.

In the practice of law, the duty of loyalty owed to a client prohibits an attorney (or a law firm) from representing any other party with interests adverse to those of a current client. The few exceptions to this rule require informed written consent from all affected clients, &quot;i.e.&quot;, an &quot;ethical wall&quot;. In some circumstances, a conflict of interest can never be waived by a client. In perhaps the most common example encountered by the general public, the same firm should not represent both parties in a divorce or child custody matter. Found conflict can lead to denial or disgorgement of legal fees, or in some cases (such as the failure to make mandatory disclosure), criminal proceedings. In 1998, a Milbank, Tweed, Hadley &amp; McCloy partner was found guilty of failing to disclose a conflict of interest, disbarred, and sentenced to 15 months of imprisonment. In the United States, a law firm usually cannot represent a client if the client&#x27;s interests conflict with those of another client, even if the two clients are represented by separate lawyers within the firm, unless (in some jurisdictions) the lawyer is segregated from the rest of the firm for the duration of the conflict. Law firms often employ software in conjunction with their case management and accounting systems in order to meet their duties to monitor their conflict of interest exposure and to assist in obtaining waivers.

==Outside of the practice of law==
More generally, conflicts of interest can be defined as any situation in which an individual or corporation (either private or governmental) is in a position to exploit a professional or official capacity in some way for their personal or corporate benefit.

Depending upon the law or rules related to a particular organization, the existence of a conflict of interest may not, in and of itself, be evidence of wrongdoing. In fact, for many professionals, it is virtually impossible to avoid having conflicts of interest from time to time. A conflict of interest can, however, become a legal matter, for example, when an individual tries (and/or succeeds in) influencing the outcome of a decision, for personal benefit. A director or executive of a corporation will be subject to legal liability if a conflict of interest breaches his/her duty of loyalty.

There often is confusion over these two situations. Someone accused of a conflict of interest may deny that a conflict exists because he/she did not act improperly. In fact, a conflict of interest can exist even if there are no improper acts as a result of it. (One way to understand this is to use the term &quot;conflict of roles&quot;. A person with two roles—an individual who owns stock and is also a government official, for example—may experience situations where those two roles conflict. The conflict can be mitigated—see below—but it still exists. In and of itself, having two roles is not illegal, but the differing roles will certainly provide an incentive for improper acts in some circumstances.)

As an example, in the sphere of business and control, according to the Institute of Internal Auditors:

A few examples of conflict of interest are:
* When a member of the commissioners of a state highway commission owns a piece of property where the state will have to condemn it. The conflict of interest comes in because the commission will want to acquire the property at the lowest possible price (subject to it being at least fair market value) while as the property owner, they will want the highest possible price they can get.
* When an officer or director of a corporation owns a patent or copyright that either was developed before they were involved with the corporation (which means it cannot be subject to a contractual right of assignment or work for hire) or that it was developed for a type of product not related to the scope of their employment. As authors or inventors, they are going to want a large license fee or royalty, while as an officer of the corporation they are expected to offer as little as possible.
* A judge deciding a bench trial or arbitrator in binding arbitration must not decide a case where a relative, acquaintance, or business partner is a party. Because they may give overly favorable terms to that party, or where they might impose excessively harsh terms (such as a judge having their estranged child, parent, or ex-spouse as a criminal defendant being sentenced before them).

==Organizational==

An organizational conflict of interest (OCI) may exist in the same way as described above, for instance where a corporation provides two types of service to the government and these services conflict (e.g.: manufacturing parts and then participating in a selection committee comparing parts manufacturers). Corporations may develop simple or complex systems to mitigate the risk or perceived risk of a conflict of interest. These risks can be evaluated by a government agency (for example, in a U.S. Government RFP) to determine whether the risks create a substantial advantage to the organization in question over its competition, or will decrease the overall competitiveness of the bidding process.

==Conflict of interest in the healthcare industry==

The influence of the pharmaceutical industry on medical research has been a major cause for concern. In 2009 a study found that &quot;a significant number of academic institutions&quot; do not have clear guidelines for relationships between Institutional Review Boards and industry. The medical-industrial complex describes the interaction between physician&#x27;s conflict of interest with for-profit healthcare, continuing medical education, and patient&#x27;s ethical considerations.

In contrast to this viewpoint, an article and associated editorial in the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot; in May 2015 emphasized the importance of pharmaceutical industry-physician interactions for the development of novel treatments, and argued that moral outrage over industry malfeasance had unjustifiably led many to overemphasize the problems created by financial conflicts of interest. The article noted that major healthcare organizations such as the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences of the National Institutes of Health, the President&#x27;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, the World Economic Forum, the Gates Foundation, the Wellcome Trust, and the Food and Drug Administration had encouraged greater interactions between physicians and industry in order to bring greater benefits to patients. 

==Types==

The following are the most common forms of conflicts of interests:
* Self-dealing, in which an official who controls an organization causes it to enter into a transaction with the official, or with another organization that benefits the official only. The official is on both sides of the &quot;deal.&quot;
* Outside employment, in which the interests of one job conflict with another.
* Nepotism, in which a spouse, child, or other close relative is employed (or applies for employment) by an individual, or where goods or services are purchased from a relative or from a firm controlled by a relative. To avoid nepotism in hiring, many employment applications ask if the applicant is related to a current employee of the company. This allows recusal if the employed relative has a role in the hiring process. If this is the case, the relative could then be recused from any hiring decisions.
* Gifts from friends who also do business with the person receiving the gifts or from individuals or corporations who do business with the organization in which the gift recipient is employed. Such gifts may include non-tangible things of value such as transportation and lodging.
* Pump and dump, in which a stockbroker who owns a security artificially inflates the price by &quot;upgrading&quot; it or spreading rumors, sells the security and adds a short position, then &quot;downgrades&quot; the security or spreads negative rumors to push the price down.

Other improper acts that are sometimes classified as conflicts of interest may have a better classification. For example, accepting bribes can be classified as corruption, the use of government or corporate property or assets for personal use is fraud, and unauthorized distribution of confidential information is a security breach. For these improper acts, there is no inherent conflict.

 COI is sometimes termed competition of interest rather than &quot;conflict&quot;, emphasizing a connotation of the natural competition between valid interests—rather than the classical definition of conflict, which would include by definition including a victim and unfair aggression. Nevertheless, this denotation of conflict of interest is not generally seen.

==Examples==
===Environmental hazards and human health===
Baker summarized 176 studies of the potential impact of Bisphenol A on human health as follows:

Lessig noted that this does not mean that the funding source influenced the results. However, it does raise questions about the validity of the industry-funded studies specifically, because the researchers conducting those studies have a conflict of interest; they are subject at minimum to a natural human inclination to please the people who paid for their work. Lessig provided a similar summary of 326 studies of the potential harm from cell phone usage with results that were similar but not as stark.

=== Self-regulation ===
Self-regulation of any group may also be a conflict of interest. If an entity, such as a corporation or government bureaucracy, is asked to eliminate unethical behavior within its own group, it may be in its interest in the short run to eliminate the appearance of unethical behavior, rather than the behavior itself, by keeping any ethical breaches hidden, instead of exposing and correcting them. An exception occurs when the ethical breach is already known by the public. In that case, it could be in the group&#x27;s interest to end the ethical problem of which the public has knowledge, but keep the remaining breaches hidden.

===Insurance claims adjusters===
Insurance companies retain claims adjusters to represent their interest in adjusting claims. It is in the best interest of the insurance companies that the very smallest settlement is reached with its claimants. Based on the adjuster&#x27;s experience and knowledge of the insurance policy it is very easy for the adjuster to convince an unknowing claimant to settle for less than what they may otherwise be entitled which could be a larger settlement. There is always a very good chance for a conflict of interest existing when one adjuster tries to represent both sides of a financial transaction such as an insurance claim. This problem is exacerbated when the claimant is told or believes, the insurance company&#x27;s claims adjuster is fair and impartial enough to satisfy both their and the insurance company&#x27;s interests. These types of conflicts could easily be avoided by the use of a third-party platform, independent of the insurers, which is agreed to, and named in the policy.

===Purchasing agents and sales personnel===
A person working as the equipment purchaser for a company may get a bonus proportionate to the amount the company is under budget by year-end. However, this becomes an incentive for the employee to purchase inexpensive, substandard equipment. Therefore, this is counter to the interests of those in the company who must actually use the equipment. W. Edwards Deming listed &quot;purchasing on price alone&quot; as number 4 of his famous 14 points, and he often said things to the effect that &quot;He who purchases on price alone deserves to get rooked.&quot;

===Real estate agents===
Real estate brokers have an inherent conflict of interest with the sellers they represent, because the usual commission structures of brokers motivate them to sell quickly rather than to sell at a higher price. However, a broker representing a buyer has a distinct disincentive to negotiate a lower price on behalf of their client, because they will simultaneously be negotiating their own commission lower.

===Government officials===
Regulating conflict of interest in government is one of the aims of political ethics. Public officials are expected to put service to the public and their constituents ahead of their personal interests. Conflict of interest rules are intended to prevent officials from making decisions in circumstances that could reasonably be perceived as violating this duty of office. Rules in the executive branch tend to be stricter and easier to enforce than in the legislative branch. This is visible through one study that highlights how Members of Congress who have specific stock investments may vote on regulatory and interventionist legislation. Two problems make legislative ethics of conflicts difficult and distinctive. First, as James Madison wrote, legislators should share a &quot;communion of interests&quot; with their constituents. Legislators cannot adequately represent the interests of constituents without also representing some of their own. As Senator Robert S. Kerr once said, &quot;I represent the farmers of Oklahoma, although I have large farm interests. I represent the oil business in Oklahoma...and I am in the oil business...They don&#x27;t want to send a man here who has no community of interest with them, because he wouldn&#x27;t be worth a nickel to them.&quot; The problem is to distinguish special interests from the general interests of all constituents. Second, the &quot;political interests&quot; of legislatures include campaign contributions which they need to get elected, and which are generally not illegal and not the same as a bribe. But under many circumstances, they can have the same effect. The problem here is how to keep the secondary interest in raising campaign funds from overwhelming what should be their primary interest—fulfilling the duties of office.

Politics in the United States is dominated in many ways by political campaign contributions. Candidates are often not considered &quot;credible&quot; unless they have a campaign budget far beyond what could reasonably be raised from citizens of ordinary means. The impact of this money can be found in many places, most notably in studies of how campaign contributions affect legislative behavior. For example, the price of sugar in the United States has been roughly double the international price for over half a century. In the 1980s, this added $3 billion to the annual budget of U.S. consumers, according to Stern, who provided the following summary of one part of how this happens:
This $3 billion translates into $41 per household per year. This is, in essence, a tax collected by a nongovernmental agency: It is a cost imposed on consumers by governmental decisions, but never considered in any of the standard data on tax collections.

Stern notes that sugar interests contributed $2.6 million to political campaigns, representing well over $1,000 return for each $1 contributed to political campaigns. This, however, does not include the cost of lobbying. Lessig cites six different studies that consider the cost of lobbying with campaign contributions on a variety of issues considered in Washington, D.C. These studies produced estimates of the anticipated return on each $1 invested in lobbying and political campaigns that ranged from $6 to $220. Lessig notes that clients who pay tens of millions of dollars to lobbyists typically receive billions.

Lessig insists that this does not mean that any legislator has sold their vote. One of several possible explanations Lessig gives for this phenomenon is that the money helped elect candidates more supportive of the issues pushed by the big money spent on lobbying and political campaigns. He notes that if any money perverts democracy, it is the large contributions beyond the budgets of citizens of ordinary means; small contributions from common citizens have long been considered to support democracy.

When such large sums become virtually essential to a politician&#x27;s future, it generates a substantive conflict of interest contributing to a fairly well-documented distortion of the nation&#x27;s priorities and policies.

Beyond this, governmental officials, whether elected or not, often leave public service to work for companies affected by legislation they helped enact or companies they used to regulate. This practice is called the &quot;revolving door&quot;. Former legislators and regulators are accused of (a) using inside information for their new employers or (b) compromising laws and regulations in hopes of securing lucrative employment in the private sector. This possibility creates a conflict of interest for all public officials whose future may depend on the revolving door.

===Finance industry and elected officials===

Conflicts of interest among elected officials are part of the story behind the increase in the percentage of US corporate domestic profits captured by the finance industry depicted in the accompanying figure.

From 1934 through 1985, the finance industry averaged 13.8% of U.S. domestic corporate profit. Between 1986 and 1999, it averaged 23.5%. From 2000 through 2010, it averaged 32.6%. Some of this increase is doubtless due to increased efficiency from banking consolidation and innovations in new financial products that benefit consumers. However, if most consumers had refused to accept financial products they did not understand, e.g., negative amortization loans, the finance industry would not have been as profitable as it has been, and the Late-2000s recession might have been avoided or postponed. Stiglitz argued that the Late-2000s recession was created in part because, &quot;Bankers acted greedily because they had incentives and opportunities to do so&quot;. They did this in part by innovating to make consumer financial products like retail banking services and home mortgages as complicated as possible to make it easy for them to charge higher fees. Consumers who shop carefully for financial services typically find better options than the primary offerings of the major banks. However, few consumers think to do that. This explains part of this increase in financial industry profits. (Note, however, that Stiglitz has been accused of a conflict of interests and violation of Columbia University transparency policies for failing to disclose his status as a paid consultant to the government of Argentina at the same time he was writing articles in defense of Argentina&#x27;s planned default of over $1billion in bond debt during the 1998–2002 Argentine great depression, and for failing to disclose his paid consultancy to the government of Greece at the same time he was downplaying the risk of Greece defaulting on their debt during the Greek government-debt crisis of 2009.)

However, it is argued that a major portion of this increase and a driving force behind the Late-2000s recession has been the corrosive effect of money in politics, giving legislators and the President of the U.S. a conflict of interest, because if they protect the public, they will offend the finance industry, which contributed $1.7 billion to political campaigns and spent $3.4 billion ($5.1 billion total) on lobbying from 1998 to 2008.

To be conservative, suppose we attribute only the increase from 23.5% of 1986 through 1999 to the recent 32.6% average to governmental actions subject to conflicts of interest created by the $1.7 billion in campaign contributions. That is 9% of the $3 trillion in profits claimed by the finance industry during that period or $270 billion. This represents a return of over $50 for each $1 invested in political campaigns and lobbying for that industry. (This $270 billion represents almost $1,000 for every man, woman and child in the United States.) There is hardly any place outside politics with such a high return on investment in such a short time.

===Finance industry and economists===
Economists (unlike other professions such as sociologists) do not formally subscribe to a professional ethical code. Close to 300 economists have signed a letter urging the American Economic Association (the discipline&#x27;s foremost professional body), to adopt such a code. The signatories include George Akerlof, a Nobel laureate, and Christina Romer, who headed Barack Obama&#x27;s Council of Economic Advisers.

This call for a code of ethics was supported by the public attention the documentary &quot;Inside Job&quot; (winner of an Academy Award) drew to the consulting relationships of several influential economists. This documentary focused on conflicts that may arise when economists publish results or provide public recommendations on topics that affect industries or companies with which they have financial links. Critics of the profession argue, for example, that it is no coincidence that financial economists, many of whom were engaged as consultants by Wall Street firms, were opposed to regulating the financial sector.

In response to criticism that the profession not only failed to predict the financial crisis of 2007–2008 but may actually have helped create it, the American Economic Association has adopted new rules in 2012: economists will have to disclose financial ties and other potential conflicts of interest in papers published in academic journals. Backers argue such disclosures will help restore faith in the profession by increasing transparency which will help in assessing economists&#x27; advice.

===Stockbrokers===
A conflict of interest is a manifestation of moral hazard, particularly when a financial institution provides multiple services and the potentially competing interests of those services may lead to a concealment of information or dissemination of misleading information. A conflict of interest exists when a party to a transaction could potentially make a gain from taking actions that are detrimental to the other party in the transaction.

There are many types of conflicts of interest such as a pump and dump by stockbrokers. This is when a stockbroker who owns a security artificially inflates the price by upgrading it or spreading rumors, and then sells the security and adds short position. They will then downgrade the security or spread negative rumors to push the price back down. This is an example of stock fraud. It is a conflict of interest because the stockbrokers are concealing and manipulating information to make it misleading for the buyers. The broker may claim to have the &quot;inside&quot; information about impending news and will urge buyers to buy the stock quickly. Investors will buy the stock, which creates a high demand and raises the prices. This rise in prices can entice more people to believe the hype and then buy shares as well. The stockbrokers will then sell their shares and stop promoting, the price will drop, and other investors are left holding stock that is worth nothing compared to what they paid for it. In this way, brokers use their knowledge and position to gain personally at the expense of others.

The Enron scandal is a major example of pump and dump. Executives participated in an elaborate scheme, falsely reporting profits, thus inflating its stock prices, and covered up the real numbers with questionable accounting; 29 executives sold overvalued stock for more than a billion dollars before the company went bankrupt.

A financial institution with a conflict of interest may also be charged with market manipulation. Stockbrokers that act as market makers have a duty to establish bona fide. A conflict of interest serves against that regulation. Stockbrokers have to prove that their trading interests and transacting interests do not interfere with serving the interests of investors at brokerages.

===News media===
Commercial news media have a conflict of interest in discussing anything that may impact their ability to communicate with their audience. Most news outlets, when reporting a story that involves a parent company or a subsidiary, will explicitly report this fact as part of the story, in order to alert the audience that their reporting has the potential for bias due to the possible conflict of interest.

The business model of commercial media organizations (i.e., any that accept advertising) is selling behavior change in their audience to advertisers. However, few in their audience are aware of the conflict of interest between the profit motive and the altruistic desire to serve the public and &quot;give the audience what it wants&quot;.

Many major advertisers test their ads in various ways to measure the return on investment in advertising. Advertising rates are set as a function of the size and spending habits of the viewing audience as measured by the Nielsen Ratings. Media action expressing this conflict of interest is illustrated in the reaction of Rupert Murdoch, Chairman of News Corporation (the owner of Fox Broadcasting, to changes in data collection methodology adopted by Nielsen in 2004 to more accurately measure viewing habits. The results corrected a previous overestimate of Fox&#x27;s market share. Murdoch reacted by getting leading politicians to denounce the Nielsen Ratings as &quot;racist&quot;. Susan Whiting, president and CEO of Nielsen Media Research, responded by quietly sharing Nielsen&#x27;s data with her leading critics. The criticism disappeared, and Fox paid Nielsen&#x27;s fees. Murdoch had a conflict of interest between the reality of his market and his finances.

Commercial media organizations can lose money if they provide content that offends either their audience or their advertisers. The substantial media consolidation that has occurred since the 1980s has reduced the alternatives available to the audience, thereby making it easier for the ever-larger companies in this increasingly oligopolistic industry to hide news and entertainment potentially offensive to advertisers without losing audience. 

If the news media provide too much information on how Congress spends its time, a major advertiser could be offended and could reduce their advertising expenditures with the offending media company. This is one of the ways the market system has determined which companies won and which either went out of business or were purchased by others during this period of media consolidation. (Advertisers don&#x27;t like to feed the mouth that bites them, and often don&#x27;t. Similarly, commercial media organizations are not eager to bite the hand that feeds them.) Advertisers have been known to fund media organizations with editorial policies they find offensive if that media outlet provides access to a sufficiently attractive audience segment they cannot efficiently reach otherwise.

Election years are a major boon to commercial broadcasters, because virtually all political advertising is purchased with minimal advance planning, paying, therefore, the highest rates. The commercial media have a conflict of interest in anything that could make it easier for candidates to get elected with less money.

Accompanying this trend in media consolidation has been a substantial reduction in investigative journalism, reflecting this conflict of interest between the business objectives of the commercial media and the public&#x27;s need to know what government is doing in their name. This change has been tied to substantial changes in law and culture in the United States. To cite only one example, researchers have tied this decline in investigative journalism to an increased coverage of the &quot;police blotter&quot;. This has further been tied to the fact that the United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world.

Beyond this, virtually all commercial media companies own substantial quantities of copyrighted material. This gives them an inherent conflict of interest in any public policy issue affecting copyrights. McChesney noted that the commercial media have lobbied successfully for changes in copyright law that have led &quot;to higher prices and a shrinking of the marketplace of ideas&quot;, increasing the power and profits of the large media corporations at public expense. One result of this is that &quot;the people cease to have a means of clarifying social priorities and organizing social reform&quot;. A free market has a mechanism for controlling abuses of power by media corporations: If their censorship becomes too egregious, they lose audience, which in turn reduces their advertising rates. However, the effectiveness of this mechanism has been substantially reduced over the past quarter century by &quot;the changes in the concentration and integration of the media.&quot; Would the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement have advanced to the point of generating substantial protests without the secrecy behind which that agreement was negotiated—and would the government attempts to sustain that secrecy have been as successful if the commercial media had not been a primary beneficiary and had not had a conflict of interest in suppressing discussion thereof?

===Law, administration, and academia===
Many professions are governed by standards of impartiality, including law, public administration, social work, and academia. Obligations of academic disclosure of may be covered in style guides addressing professional ethics.

=== Consulting firms ===
When working for governments, consulting firms face potential conflicts of interest. We can identify four of them: personal connections and interests, working with conflicting clients and assignments, providing for-profit advice, and using personal connections within government to influence decisions.

Sometimes, people who may be perceived to have a conflict of interest resign from a position or sell a shareholding in a venture, to eliminate the conflict of interest going forward. For example, Lord Evans of Weardale resigned as a non-executive director of the UK National Crime Agency after a tax-avoidance-related controversy about HSBC, where Lord Evans was also a non-executive director. This resignation was stated to have taken place in order to avoid the appearance of conflict of interest.

===&quot;Blind trust&quot;===
Blind trusts can perhaps mitigate conflicts of interest scenarios by giving an independent trustee control of a beneficiary&#x27;s assets. The independent trustee must have the power to sell or transfer interests without knowledge of the beneficiary. Thus, the beneficiary becomes &quot;blind&quot; to the impact of official actions on private interests held in trust.

As an example, a politician who owns shares in a company that may be affected by government policy may put those shares in a blind trust with themselves or their family as the beneficiary. It is disputed whether this really removes the conflict of interest, however.

Blind trusts may in fact obscure conflicts of interest, and for this reason it is illegal to fund political parties in the UK via a blind trust if the identity of the real donor is concealed.

===Disclosure===
Commonly, politicians and high-ranking government officials are required to disclose financial information—assets such as stock, debts such as loans, and/or corporate positions held, typically annually. To protect privacy (to some extent), financial figures are often disclosed in ranges such as &quot;$100,000 to $500,000&quot; and &quot;over $2,000,000&quot;. Certain professionals are required either by rules related to their professional organization, or by statute, to disclose any actual or potential conflicts of interest. In some instances, the failure to provide full disclosure is a crime.

However, there is limited evidence regarding the effect of conflict of interest disclosure despite its widespread acceptance. A 2012 study published in the &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot; showed that routine disclosure of conflicts of interest by American medical school educators to pre-clinical medical students were associated with an increased desire among students for limitations in some industry relationships. However, there were no changes in the perceptions of students about the value of disclosure, the influence of industry relationships on educational content, or the instruction by faculty with relevant conflicts of interest.

One line of research suggests that disclosure can have &quot;perverse effects&quot; or, at least, is not the panacea regulators often take it to be.

===Recusal===

Those with a conflict of interest are expected to recuse themselves from (i.e., abstain from) decisions where such a conflict exists. The imperative for recusal varies depending upon the circumstance and profession, either as common sense ethics, codified ethics, or by statute. For example, if the governing board of a government agency is considering hiring a consulting firm for some task, and one firm being considered has, as a partner, a close relative of one of the board&#x27;s members, then that board member should not vote on which firm is to be selected. In fact, to minimize any conflict, the board member should not participate in any way in the decision, including discussions.

Judges are supposed to recuse themselves from cases when personal conflicts of interest may arise. For example, if a judge has participated in a case previously in some other judicial role he/she is not allowed to try that case. Recusal is also expected when one of the lawyers in a case might be a close personal friend, or when the outcome of the case might affect the judge directly, such as whether a car maker is obliged to recall a model that a judge drives. This is required by law under Continental civil law systems and by the Rome Statute, organic law of the International Criminal Court.

<text>Dictaphone was an American company founded by Alexander Graham Bell that produced dictation machines. It is now a division of Nuance Communications, based in Burlington, Massachusetts.

Although the name &quot;Dictaphone&quot; is a trademark, it has become genericized as a means to refer to any dictation machine.

== History ==
The Volta Laboratory was established by Alexander Graham Bell in Washington, D.C. in 1881. When the Laboratory&#x27;s sound-recording inventions were sufficiently developed with the assistance of Charles Sumner Tainter and others, Bell and his associates set up the Volta Graphophone Company, which later merged with the American Graphophone Company (founded in 1887) which itself later evolved into Columbia Records (founded as the Columbia Phonograph Company in 1889).

The name &quot;Dictaphone&quot; was trademarked in 1907 by the Columbia Graphophone Company, which soon became the leading manufacturer of such devices. This perpetuated the use for voice recording of wax cylinders, which had otherwise been eclipsed by disc-based technology. Dictaphone was spun off into a separate company in 1923 under the leadership of C. King Woodbridge.

In 1947, having relied on wax-cylinder recording to the end of World War II, Dictaphone introduced its Dictabelt technology. This cut a mechanical groove into a Lexan plastic belt instead of into a wax cylinder. The advantage of the Lexan belt was that recordings were permanent and admissible in court. Eventually IBM introduced a dictating machine using an erasable belt made of magnetic tape which enabled the user to correct dictation errors rather than marking errors on a paper tab. Dictaphone in turn added magnetic recording models while still selling the models recording on the Lexan belts. Machines based on magnetic tape recording were introduced in the late seventies, initially using the standard compact (or &quot;C&quot;) cassette, but soon, in dictation machines, using mini-cassettes or microcassettes instead. Using smaller cassette sizes was important to the manufacturer for reducing the size of portable recorders.

Walter D. Fuller became the director of the company in 1952. In 1969 he was appointed as chairman.

In Japan, JVC was licensed to produce machines designed and developed by Dictaphone. Dictaphone and JVC later developed the picocassette, released in 1985, which was even smaller than a microcassette but retained a good recording quality and duration.

Dictaphone also developed &quot;endless loop&quot; recording using magnetic tape, introduced in the mid-seventies as the &quot;Thought Tank&quot;. The recording medium did not need to be moved from where the dictation took place to the location such as a typing pool where the typists were located. This was normally operated via a dedicated in-house telephone system, enabling dictation to be made from a variety of locations within the hospital or other organizations with typing pools. One version calculated each typist&#x27;s turnaround time and allocated the next piece of dictation accordingly.

Dictaphone was prominent in the provision of multi-channel recorders, used extensively in the emergency services to record emergency telephone calls (to numbers such as 911, 999, 112) and subsequent conversations.

Additionally, Dictaphone at one point expanded its product line to market a line of electronic (desktop and portable) calculators.

In 1979, Dictaphone was purchased by Pitney Bowes and kept as a wholly owned but independent subsidiary.

Dictaphone bought Dual Display Word Processor, a stiff competitor to Wang Laboratories, the industry leader.

In 1982, it marketed a word processor from Symantec. The hardware sold for $5,950 in 1982. The software was an additional $600. The advent of the personal computer, MS-DOS, and general-purpose word-processing software saw the demise of the dedicated word-processor, and the division was closed.

In 1995, Pitney Bowes sold Dictaphone to the investment group Stonington Partners of Connecticut for a reported $462 million. Dictaphone thereafter sold a range of products that included speech-recognition and voicemail software with limited success as the market only existed among some early adopters despite its vertical markets&#x27; enhancements.

In 2000, Dictaphone was acquired by the then-leading Belgian voice-recognition and translation company Lernout &amp; Hauspie for nearly $1 billion. Lernout &amp; Hauspie provided the voice-recognition technology for Dictaphone&#x27;s enhanced voice-recognition-based transcription system. Soon after the purchase, however, the SEC raised questions about Lernout &amp; Hauspie&#x27;s finances, focusing on the supposedly skyrocketing income reported from its East Asian endeavors. Subsequently, the company and all its subsidiaries, including Dictaphone, were forced into bankruptcy protection.

In early 2002, Dictaphone emerged from bankruptcy as a privately held organization, with Rob Schwager as its chairman and CEO. In 2004, it was split into three divisions:
*IHS, focusing on dictation for the healthcare and medical industries;
*IVS, focusing on dictation in law offices and police stations;
*CRS (Communications Recording Solutions), focusing on voice logging and radios for use by public-safety organizations and quality-monitoring by call centers.

In June 2005, Dictaphone Corporation announced the sale of its Communications Recording Systems to NICE Systems for $38.5 million. This was considered a great bargain in the industry and came after NICE was ordered to pay Dictaphone $10 million in settlements related to a patent-infringement suit in late 2003. 

In September 2005, Dictaphone sold its IVS business outside the United States to a private Swiss group around its former VP Martin Niederberger, who formed Dictaphone IVS AG (later Calison AG) in Urdorf, Switzerland and developed &quot;FRISBEE&quot;, the first hardware-independent dictation-management software system with integrated speech-recognition and workflow management. In 2008, took over the activities and products of the former Calison AG.

In February and March 2006, the remainder of Dictaphone was sold for $357 million to Nuance Communications (formerly ScanSoft), ending its short tenure as an independent company that had begun in 2002. This, in effect, closed a circle of events, as Dictaphone had been sold to Lernout &amp; Hauspie prior to L&amp;H&#x27;s bankruptcy which resulted in Dictaphone becoming an independent company.

In March 2007, Nuance acquired Focus Informatics and, with the intention of further expansion in its healthcare-transcription business, linked it with its Dictaphone division.

<text>The London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (Libor ) was an interest rate average calculated from estimates submitted by the leading banks in London. Each bank estimated what it would be charged were it to borrow from other banks. It was the primary benchmark, along with the Euribor, for short-term interest rates around the world. Libor was phased out at the end of 2021, with market participants encouraged to transition to risk-free interest rates such as SOFR and SARON.

LIBOR was discontinued in the summer of 2023. The last rates were published on 30 June 2023 before 12:00 pm UK time. The 1 month, 3 month, 6 month, and 12 month Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) is its replacement. In July 2023, the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) said four unnamed dollar-denominated alternatives to LIBOR, known as &quot;credit-sensitive rates&quot;, had &quot;varying degrees of vulnerability&quot; that might appear during times of market stress.

Libor rates were calculated for five currencies and seven borrowing periods, ranging from overnight to one year, and were published each business day by Thomson Reuters. Many financial institutions, mortgage lenders, and credit card agencies set their own rates relative to it. At least $350 trillion in derivatives and other financial products were tied to Libor.

In June 2012, multiple criminal settlements by Barclays Bank revealed significant fraud and collusion by member banks connected to the rate submissions, leading to the Libor scandal. The British Bankers&#x27; Association said on 25 September 2012 that it would transfer oversight of Libor to UK regulators, as proposed by Financial Services Authority managing director Martin Wheatley&#x27;s independent review recommendations. Wheatley&#x27;s review recommended that banks submitting rates to Libor must base them on actual inter-bank deposit market transactions and keep records of those transactions, that individual banks&#x27; Libor submissions be published after three months, and recommended criminal sanctions specifically for manipulation of benchmark interest rates. Financial institution customers may experience higher and more volatile borrowing and hedging costs after implementation of the recommended reforms. The UK government agreed to accept all of the Wheatley Review&#x27;s recommendations and press for legislation implementing them.

Significant reforms, in line with the Wheatley Review, came into effect in 2013 and a new administrator took over in early 2014. The British government regulated Libor through criminal and regulatory laws passed by Parliament. In particular, the Financial Services Act 2012 brought Libor under UK regulatory oversight and created a criminal offence for knowingly or deliberately making false or misleading statements relating to benchmark-setting.

==Introduction==
The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) came into widespread use in the 1970s as a reference interest rate for transactions in offshore Eurodollar markets.
In 1984, it became apparent that an increasing number of banks were trading actively in a variety of relatively new market instruments, notably interest rate swaps, foreign currency options and forward rate agreements. While recognizing that such instruments brought more business and greater depth to the London Inter-bank market, bankers worried that future growth could be inhibited unless a measure of uniformity was introduced. In October 1984, the British Bankers&#x27; Association (BBA)—working with other parties, such as the Bank of England—established various working parties, which eventually culminated in the production of the BBA standard for interest rate swaps, or &quot;BBAIRS&quot; terms. Part of this standard included the fixing of BBA interest-settlement rates, the predecessor of BBA Libor. From 2 September 1985, the BBAIRS terms became standard market practice. BBA Libor fixings did not commence officially before 1 January 1986. Before that date, however, some rates were fixed for a trial period commencing in December 1984.

Member banks are international in scope, with more than sixty nations represented among its 223 members and 37 associated professional firms as of 2008. Seventeen banks for example contributed at one point to the fixing of US Dollar Libor. The panel contains the following member banks:

* Bank of America
* Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ
* Barclays Bank
* Citibank NA
* Credit Agricole CIB
* Credit Suisse
* Deutsche Bank
* HSBC
* JP Morgan Chase
* Lloyds Banking Group
* Rabobank
* Royal Bank of Canada
* Société Générale
* Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation Europe Ltd
* Norinchukin Bank
* Royal Bank of Scotland
* UBS AG

==Scope==
Libor was widely used as a reference rate for many financial instruments in both financial markets and commercial fields. There were three major classifications of interest rate fixings instruments, including standard inter-bank products, commercial field products, and hybrid products that often used Libor as their reference rate.

Standard interbank products:
*Forward rate agreements
*Interest rate futures, e.g. Eurodollar futures
*Interest rate swaps
*Swaptions
*Overnight indexed swaps, e.g. Libor–OIS spread
*Interest rate options, Interest rate cap and floor

Commercial field products:
*Floating rate notes
*Floating rate certificates of deposit
*Syndicated loans
*Variable rate mortgages
*Term loans

Hybrid products:
*Range accrual notes
*Step up callable notes
*Target redemption notes
*Hybrid perpetual notes
*Collateralized mortgage obligations
*Collateralized debt obligations

In the United States in 2008, around sixty percent of prime adjustable-rate mortgages and nearly all subprime mortgages were indexed to the US dollar Libor. In 2012, around 45 percent of prime adjustable rate mortgages and more than 80 percent of subprime mortgages were indexed to the Libor. American municipalities also borrowed around 75 percent of their money through financial products that were linked to the Libor. In the UK, the three-month British pound Libor was used for some mortgages—especially for those with adverse credit history. The Swiss franc Libor was also used by the Swiss National Bank as their reference rate for monetary policy.

The usual reference rate for euro-denominated interest rate products is the Euribor, compiled by the European Banking Federation from a larger bank panel. A euro Libor did exist, but mainly for continuity purposes in swap contracts dating back to pre-EMU times. The Libor was an estimate, not intended for the binding contracts of a company. It was, however, specifically mentioned as a reference rate in the market standard International Swaps and Derivatives Association documentation, which were used by parties wishing to transact in over-the-counter interest rate derivatives.

==Definition==
Libor was defined as:

This definition was amplified as follows:
* The rate that each bank submits must be formed from that bank&#x27;s perception of its cost of funds in the inter-bank market.
* Contributions must represent rates formed in London and not elsewhere.
* Contributions must be for the currency concerned, not the cost of producing one currency by borrowing in another currency and accessing the required currency via the foreign exchange markets.
* The rates must be submitted by members of staff at a bank with primary responsibility for management of a bank&#x27;s cash, rather than a bank&#x27;s derivative book.
* The definition of &quot;funds&quot; is: unsecured inter-bank cash or cash raised through primary issuance of inter-bank certificates of deposit.

The British Bankers&#x27; Association published a basic guide to the BBA Libor, which contains a great deal of detail as to its history and its current calculation.

==Technical features==

===Calculation===
Libor was calculated by the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) and published by Refinitiv. It was an index that measured the cost of funds to large global banks operating in London financial markets or with London-based counterparties. Each day, the BBA surveyed a panel of banks (18 major global banks for the USD Libor), asking the question, &quot;At what rate could you borrow funds, were you to do so by asking for and then accepting interbank offers in a reasonable market size just prior to 11 am?&quot; The BBA threw out the highest four and lowest four responses, and averaged the remaining middle ten, yielding a 22% trimmed mean. The average was reported at 11:30 am.

Libor was actually a set of indexes. There were separate Libor rates reported for seven different maturities (length of time to repay a debt) for each of five currencies. The shortest maturity was overnight, the longest one year. In the United States, many private contracts referenced the three-month dollar Libor, which was the index resulting from asking the panel what rate they would pay to borrow dollars for three months.

===Currency===
In 1986, the Libor initially fixed rates for three currencies. These were the US dollar, British pound sterling, and the Deutsche Mark. Over time, this grew to sixteen currencies. After a number of these currencies merged into the euro in 2000, there remained ten currencies. Following reforms in 2013, Libor rates were calculated for five currencies.

Active until June 2023
*US dollar (USD)

*Canadian dollar (CAD)
*New Zealand dollar (NZD)
*Danish krone (DKK)
*Swedish krona (SEK)

Note that the Euro LIBOR should not be confused with EURIBOR.

===Maturities===
Until 1998, the shortest duration rate was one month, after which the rate for one week was added. In 2001, rates for a day and two weeks were introduced. Following reforms in 2013, Libor rates were calculated for 7 maturities.

==Libor-based derivatives==

===Libor futures===
GBP and CHF LIBOR futures were traded on Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) and on CurveGlobal, part of the London Stock Exchange Group. USD LIBOR futures (aka Eurodollar futures) were traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. JPY LIBOR futures (Euroyen futures) were traded on the Tokyo Financial Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

===Interest rate swaps===
Interest rate swaps based on short Libor rates traded on the interbank market for maturities up to 50 years. In the swap market, a &quot;five-year Libor&quot; rate referred to the five-year swap rate, where the floating leg of the swap referenced the three- or six-month Libor (this can be expressed more precisely as for example &quot;5-year rate vs 6-month Libor&quot;). &quot;Libor + basis points&quot;, when talking about a bond, meant that the bond&#x27;s cash flows were discounted on the swaps&#x27; zero-coupon yield curve shifted by basis points to equal the bond&#x27;s actual market price. The day count convention for Libor rates in interest rate swaps was Actual/360, except for the GBP, for which it was Actual/365 (fixed).

==Reliability and scandal==
On Thursday, 29 May 2008, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; (WSJ) released a controversial study suggesting that banks might have understated borrowing costs they reported for Libor during the 2008 credit crunch. Such under-reporting could have created an impression that banks could borrow from other banks more cheaply than they could in reality. It could also have made the banking system or specific contributing bank appear healthier than it was during the 2008 credit crunch. For example, the study found that rates at which one major bank (Citigroup) &quot;said it could borrow dollars for three months were about 0.87 percentage points lower than the rate calculated using default-insurance data.&quot;

In September 2008, a former member of the Bank of England&#x27;s Monetary Policy Committee, Willem Buiter, described Libor as &quot;the rate at which banks don&#x27;t lend to each other&quot;, and called for its replacement. The former Governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, later used the same description before the Treasury Select Committee.

To further bring this case to light, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported in March 2011 that regulators were focusing on Bank of America, Citigroup, and UBS. Making a case would be very difficult, because the Libor rate was not determined on an open exchange. According to people familiar with the situation, subpoenas were issued to the three banks.

In response to the study released by the WSJ, the British Bankers&#x27; Association announced that Libor continued to be reliable even in times of financial crisis. According to the British Bankers&#x27; Association, other proxies for financial health, such as the default-credit-insurance market, are not necessarily more sound than Libor at times of financial crisis, though they are more widely used in Latin America, especially the Ecuadorian and Bolivian markets.

Additionally, some other authorities contradicted the Wall Street Journal article. In its March 2008 Quarterly Review, The Bank for International Settlements stated that &quot;available data do not support the hypothesis that contributor banks manipulated their quotes to profit from positions based on fixings.&quot;
In October 2008, the International Monetary Fund published its regular &quot;Global Financial Stability Review&quot;, which also found that, &quot;although the integrity of the U.S. dollar Libor-fixing process has been questioned by some market participants and the financial press, it appears that U.S. dollar Libor remains an accurate measure of a typical creditworthy bank&#x27;s marginal cost of unsecured U.S. dollar term funding.&quot;

On 27 July 2012, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; published an article by a former trader that stated Libor manipulation had been common since at least 1991. Further reports followed from the BBC and Reuters. On 28 November 2012, the Finance Committee of the Bundestag held a hearing to learn more about the issue.

In late September 2012, Barclays was fined £290m because of its attempts to manipulate the Libor, and other banks were under investigation of having acted similarly. Financial Services Authority (FSA) managing director Martin Wheatley called for the British Bankers&#x27; Association to lose its power to determine Libor and for the FSA to be able to impose criminal sanctions as well as other changes in a ten-point overhaul plan.

The British Bankers&#x27; Association said on 25 September that it would transfer oversight of LIBOR to UK regulators, as proposed by Wheatley and CEO-designate of the new Financial Conduct Authority.

On 28 September, Wheatley&#x27;s independent review was published, recommending that an independent organisation with government and regulator representation, called the Tender Committee, manage the process of setting LIBOR under a new external oversight process for transparency and accountability. Banks that made submissions to LIBOR would be required to base them on actual inter-bank deposit market transactions and keep records of their transactions supporting those submissions. The review also recommended that individual banks&#x27; LIBOR submissions be published, but only after three months, to reduce the risk that they would be used as a measure of the submitting banks&#x27; creditworthiness. The review left open the possibility that regulators might compel additional banks to participate in submissions if an insufficient number do voluntarily. The review recommended criminal sanctions specifically for manipulation of benchmark interest rates such as the LIBOR, saying that existing criminal regulations for manipulation of financial instruments were inadequate. LIBOR rates could have become higher and more volatile after implementation of these reforms, so financial institution customers could have faced higher and more volatile borrowing and hedging costs. The UK government agreed to accept all of the Wheatley Review&#x27;s recommendations and press for legislation implementing them.

Bloomberg LP CEO Dan Doctoroff told the European Parliament that Bloomberg LP could develop an alternative index called the Bloomberg Interbank Offered Rate that would use data from transactions such as market-based quotes for credit default swap transactions and corporate bonds.

===Criminal investigations===
On 28 February 2012, it was revealed that the US Department of Justice was conducting a criminal investigation into Libor abuse. Among the abuses being investigated were the possibility that traders were in direct communication with bankers before the rates were set, thus allowing them an advantage in predicting that day&#x27;s fixing. Libor underpinned approximately $350 trillion in derivatives. One trader&#x27;s messages indicated that for each basis point (0.01%) that Libor was moved, those involved could net &quot;about a couple of million dollars&quot;.

On 27 June 2012, Barclays Bank was fined $200m by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, $160m by the United States Department of Justice and £59.5m by the Financial Services Authority for attempted manipulation of the Libor and Euribor rates. The United States Department of Justice and Barclays officially agreed that &quot;the manipulation of the submissions affected the fixed rates on some occasions&quot;. On 2 July 2012, Marcus Agius, chairman of Barclays, resigned from the position following the interest rate rigging scandal. Bob Diamond, the chief executive officer of Barclays, resigned on 3 July 2012. Marcus Agius was to fill his post until a replacement was found. Jerry del Missier, chief operating officer of Barclays, also resigned. Del Missier subsequently admitted that he had instructed his subordinates to submit falsified LIBORs to the British Bankers Association.

By 4 July 2012, the breadth of the scandal was evident and became the topic of analysis on news and financial programs that attempted to explain the importance of the scandal. On 6 July, it was announced that the UK Serious Fraud Office had also opened a criminal investigation into the attempted manipulation of interest rates.

On 4 October 2012, Republican US Senators Chuck Grassley and Mark Kirk announced that they were investigating Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner for complicity with the rate manipulation scandal. They accused Geithner of knowledge of the rate-fixing, and inaction which contributed to litigation that &quot;threatens to clog our courts with multi-billion dollar class action lawsuits&quot; alleging that the manipulated rates harmed state, municipal, and local governments. The senators said that an American-based interest rate index would be a better alternative and that they would take steps towards creating one.

===Aftermath===
Early estimates are that the rate manipulation scandal cost US states, counties, and local governments at least $6 billion in fraudulent interest payments, above the $4 billion that state and local governments spent to unwind their positions exposed to rate manipulation.

=== Reforms ===
The administration of Libor itself became a regulated activity overseen by the UK&#x27;s Financial Conduct Authority. Furthermore, knowingly or deliberately making false or misleading statements in relation to benchmark-setting was made a criminal offence in UK law under the Financial Services Act 2012.

The Danish, Swedish, Canadian, Australian, and New Zealand Libor rates were terminated.

From the end of July 2013, only five currencies and seven maturities were quoted every day (35 rates), reduced from 150 different Libor rates – 15 maturities for each of ten currencies, making it more likely that the rates submitted were underpinned by real trades.

From the beginning of July 2013, each individual submission that came in from the banks was embargoed for three months to reduce the motivation to submit a false rate to portray a flattering picture of creditworthiness.

A new code of conduct, introduced by a new interim oversight committee, built on this by outlining the systems and controls firms had to have in place around Libor. For example, each bank had to have a named person responsible for Libor, accountable if there is any wrongdoing. The banks had to keep records so that they could be audited by the regulators if necessary.

In early 2014, NYSE Euronext took over the administration of Libor from the British Bankers Association. The new administrator was NYSE Euronext Rates Administration Limited, a London-based, UK registered company, regulated by the UK&#x27;s Financial Conduct Authority.

On 13 November 2013, the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) Group announced the successful completion of its acquisition of NYSE Euronext. As a result of this acquisition, NYSE Euronext Rate Administration Limited was renamed ICE Benchmark Administration Limited. The appointment of a new administrator was a major step forward in the reform of LIBOR.

The scandal also led to the European Commission proposal of EU-wide benchmark regulation.

Following its cessation, industry publication &quot;Financial News&quot; noted there were &quot;an army of bankers, lawyers and traders&quot; devoted to working on the transition that would need to change their focus given the switch to a new benchmark, even as there would be other jurisdictions and currencies moving off other inter-bank lending rates in years ahead.

==LIBOR cessation and alternatives available==
Due to multiple factors, including the Libor scandal, concerns about the rates&#x27; accuracy, and changes in how banks do business, the decision was made to phase out Libor. Most LIBOR settings were to stop being issued or become unrepresentative at the end of 2021, while certain U.S. dollar settings would continue to be provided until the end of June 2023. The Financial Conduct Authority could continue to publish certain synthetic rates after these dates for loans that cannot easily be transitioned.

According to a March 2021 estimate, major banks would have to spend more than US$100 million (~$ in ) transitioning away from LIBOR. From January 2022, Libor could not be used as the reference rate in any new derivatives contracts, loans, and credit card offers.

A variety of replacements for LIBOR have been offered. In some cases, banks allow their customers to choose which rate to track.

=== Alternatives for the USD LIBOR ===

==== Alternative Reference Rates Committee ====
In 2014, the U.S. Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York announced the creation of the Alternative Rates Reference Committee (ARRC) to assess viable alternatives to the LIBOR.

In 2016, the ARRC released its first report on the possible indices that could serve as a replacement to the LIBOR.

On March 7, 2018 the ARRC announced that the committee had been reconstituted and the following groups were participating.

The ARRC would comprise the following institutions:

* AXA
* Bank of America
* BlackRock
* Citigroup
* CME Group
* Deutsche Bank
* Federal National Mortgage Association
* Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation
* GE Capital
* Goldman Sachs
* Government Finance Officers Association
* HSBC
* Intercontinental Exchange
* International Swaps and Derivatives Association
* JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co.
* LCH Clearnet
* MetLife
* Morgan Stanley
* National Association of Corporate Treasurers
* Pacific Investment Management Company
* TD Bank
* The Federal Home Loan Bank of New York
* The Independent Community Bankers of America
* The Loan Syndications and Trading Association
* The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association
* Wells Fargo
* World Bank Group

In addition, the following agencies would serve as ex officio members of the ARRC:

* Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
* Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
* Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
* Federal Housing Finance Agency
* Federal Reserve Bank of New York
* Office of Financial Research
* Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
* U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
* U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
* U.S. Treasury Department

==== Secured Overnight Financing Rate ====
In June 2017, the ARRC announced a broad Treasury repo financing rate, SOFR, as its recommended alternative to the USD LIBOR. In its justification for this choice the ARRC said:

==== Across-the-Curve Credit Spread Indices (AXI) ====
The Across-the-Curve Credit Spread Index (AXI) is a benchmark credit spread that captures the recent cost of wholesale, unsecured debt funding for publicly listed US bank holding companies and commercial banks. It can be used in conjunction with SOFR to form a robust credit-sensitive interest rate benchmark for bank lending and risk management. AXI is the weighted average of credit spreads for unsecured debt instruments with maturities ranging from overnight to five years, using weights that reflect both transaction and issuance volumes. The primary underlying input data source is the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority&#x27;s Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE), which is a mandatory post-trade reporting facility. This long-term bond component is supplemented by a short-term component using data from the Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (DTCC). The Financial Conditions Credit Spread Index (FXI) follows the same methodology as AXI, but the underlying transactions are expanded beyond banks to include all financial institutions, as well as corporate funding transactions. AXI and FXI were first conceived by Antje Berndt, Darrell Duffie, and Yichao Zhu, and were operationalized by SOFR Academy, Inc. The US-dollar benchmark spreads were launched in 2022 and are published each business day by authorized benchmark administrator Invesco Indexing LLC, an independent index provider owned by global asset management firm Invesco. AXI and FXI are accessible via Bloomberg and Refinitiv / LSEG.

==== Ameribor ====
Ameribor is a benchmark interest rate created by the American Financial Exchange. Ameribor reflects the actual borrowing costs of thousands of small, medium, and regional banks across America, but it is also useful for larger banks and financial institutions that do business with these banks, as well as small and middle market companies. Ameribor has traded more than $550 billion (~$ in ) since inception in 2015. In addition, the AFX launched Ameribor futures on August 16, 2019.

==== U.S. Dollar ICE Bank Yield Index ====
The U.S. Dollar ICE Bank Yield Index is an index proposed by Intercontinental Exchange Benchmark Administration (IBA) in January 2019 to measure the yields at which investors are willing to lend U.S. dollar funds to large, internationally active banks on a wholesale, unsecured basis over one-month, three-month and six-month periods. Its usage is intended to be similar to how Libor is currently used.

=== Alternatives for Yen LIBOR ===
Alternatives for Yen LIBOR include the Tokyo Overnight Average Rate (TONAR).

<doc id="236853" wikidata="Q1112471" url="?curid=236853" title="Columbia Graphophone Company">
<text>Columbia Graphophone Co. Ltd. was one of the earliest gramophone companies in the United Kingdom.

Founded in 1917 as an offshoot of the American Columbia Phonograph Company, it became an independent British-owned company in 1922 in a management buy-out after the parent company went into receivership.

In 1925, it acquired a controlling interest in its American parent company to take advantage of a new electrical recording process. The British firm also controlled the US operations from 1925 until 1931. That year Columbia Graphophone in the UK merged with the Gramophone Company (which sold records under their His Master&#x27;s Voice label) to form EMI. At the same time, Columbia divested itself of its American branch, which was eventually absorbed by Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) in 1938.

The company&#x27;s record label Columbia became a successful British brand in the 1950s and 1960s, and was eventually replaced by the newly created EMI Records, as part of a label consolidation. This in turn was absorbed by the Parlophone Records unit of Warner Music Group in 2013.

==Early history==
The Columbia Phonograph Company was originally founded in the US by Edward D. Easton in 1887, initially as a distributor with a local monopoly on sales and service of Edison phonographs and phonograph cylinders in Washington, D.C., Maryland, and Delaware. It also made its own compatible cylinder recordings. In 1901, Columbia began selling disc records (invented and patented by Emile Berliner of the Victor Talking Machine Company) and phonographs. For a decade, Columbia competed with both the Edison Phonograph Company cylinders and the Victor discs. Edison discs and Columbia&#x27;s acoustic records both had a nominal playback speed of 80 rpm.

From about 1898 until 1922 the US parent company managed a UK subsidiary, the Columbia Graphophone Manufacturing Company. Its headquarters and studios were established in Victorian warehouses at 102-108 Clerkenwell Road shortly before the First World War, and the buildings were a key location in the development of the British recording industry until the 1930s. In 1917, the Columbia Graphophone Company was registered as a British company, with the shares being held by the American firm.
A general market downturn in 1921 affected the whole entertainment industry. Profits turned to losses, and in late 1922 the creditors of the US parent company filed a petition for involuntary bankruptcy: Columbia went into receivership. Seeking to raise cash, Columbia sold the British branch in December 1922 to a group of investors led by Columbia&#x27;s General Manager in Britain, the American-born Louis Sterling (1879–1958).

Columbia in the US emerged from receivership in February 1924 as the Columbia Phonograph Company Inc., but was immediately faced with another crisis, as booming radio sales reduced the firm&#x27;s profitability. The same year, Bell Labs-Western Electric had developed a new electrical recording system to replace the old acoustic recording methods, and was offering exclusive rights to Victor although its Chairman&#x27;s illness had led to delays. Louis Sterling as Managing Director had turned around the fortunes of UK Columbia, and persuaded Western Electric that granting a monopoly would be a grave mistake. Columbia had been making test electrical recordings since at least August 1924 with the Western Electrical system. Although the Columbia Phonograph Company of New York could not afford the royalty payments, Sterling was in a position to buy out the US operation and, as an American company, to purchase the licence for the new Western Electric patents. Satisfied with the progress of the test recordings, in March 1925, Louis Sterling (backed by J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.), acquired a controlling interest in the parent company, Columbia US, for $2.5 million (about £500,000) in order to take advantage of Western Electric&#x27;s patents. The firm continued in business as the Columbia Graphophone Company in many countries as a British company. Sterling, originally from New York, became chairman of the US operation.

On February 25, 1925, Columbia began recording with the licensed Western Electric recording process and was using it on a regular basis by April. The royalty payments were considerable, and in 1928 Columbia hired the English electronics engineer Alan Blumlein to work on an alternative. By late 1930, he had developed a recording system including a moving-coil microphone and a cutting head with linear characteristics which circumvented Western Electric&#x27;s patents. Columbia continued to use acoustic recording methods for the cheaper labels, and to release discs made with old acoustic masters on the Harmony and Velvet Tone labels until around 1929.

The repercussions of the stock market Crash of 1929 led to huge losses in the recording industry and, in March 1931, J.P Morgan, the major shareholder, steered the Columbia Graphophone Company (along with Odeon Records and Parlophone, which it had owned since 1926) into a merger with the Gramophone Company to form Electric and Musical Industries Ltd (EMI). By the time of the merger, the Gramophone Company had not fully developed an alternative to Western Electric&#x27;s process and was still paying royalty fees, so it was a technically advantageous move.

Since the Gramophone Company was a wholly owned subsidiary of Victor, and Columbia in America was a subsidiary of UK Columbia, Victor now technically owned its largest rival in the US. To avoid antitrust legislation, EMI had to sell off its US Columbia operation, which continued to release pressings of matrices made in the UK. The American company was eventually absorbed by Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) (another of its former offshoots) in 1938.

==As an EMI label==
EMI continued to operate the Columbia record label in the UK until the early 1970s, and in all other territories except for the US, Canada, Spain and Japan, until it sold its remaining interest in the Columbia trademark to Sony Music Entertainment in 1990.

Under EMI, UK Columbia&#x27;s releases were mainly licensed recordings from American Columbia until 1951 when American Columbia switched British distribution to Philips Records. UK Columbia continued to distribute American Columbia sister labels Okeh and Epic until 1968 when American Columbia&#x27;s then parent CBS moved distribution of all its labels to the new CBS Records created from the purchase of Oriole Records (UK) in late 1964. The loss of American Columbia product had forced UK Columbia to groom its own talent such as Russ Conway, John Barry, Cliff Richard, the Shadows, Helen Shapiro, Frank Ifield, Freddie and the Dreamers, the Dave Clark Five, Shirley Bassey, Frankie Vaughan, Des O&#x27;Connor, Ken Dodd, the Animals, Herman&#x27;s Hermits, Gerry and the Pacemakers, the Seekers, the Yardbirds, Jeff Beck, and Pink Floyd. Led by A&amp;R man Norrie Paramor, the label was arguably the most successful in Britain in the rock era prior to the beat boom.

In the mid 1960s, UK Columbia added an audiophile imprint called Studio 2 Stereo. During that time, the Columbia Graphophone Company was absorbed into the Gramophone Company with the label maintaining its identity.

EMI engaged in litigation with CBS regarding the importing of American records bearing the Columbia imprint into areas where EMI owned the Columbia name.

Releases from the British Columbia Graphophone Company appeared in Japan under Nippon Columbia until 1962, when licensing was switched to Toshiba Musical Industries.

==Phaseout of label by EMI and trade mark transfer==
EMI decided to reserve the His Master&#x27;s Voice label for classical repertoire and had transferred His Master&#x27;s Voice&#x27;s remaining pop acts to Columbia and Parlophone by 1967. EMI began to replace the Columbia label with the eponymous EMI Records in January 1973. The last Columbia single was issued in 1989. EMI sold its remaining interest in the Columbia name in 1990 to Sony Music Entertainment (formerly CBS Records Group), which already owned Columbia Records in the U.S. and Canada. The formal reassignment of British registered trade marks from EMI, including the &quot;magic notes&quot; logo, took place in 1993.

For the Columbia Records trade mark in the UK and elsewhere, Sony Music now prefers the &quot;walking eye&quot; logo previously used by the old CBS Records, which is based on the Columbia Records logo introduced in the US and Canada in 1955. However, the &quot;magic notes&quot; logo is occasionally used, usually to give a &#x27;retro&#x27; feel (such as on the 2016 vinyl reissues of Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot; and &quot;A Saucerful of Secrets,&quot; and on Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot;).

The Columbia name was still on some EMI releases between 1973 and 1990 (such as Baltimora&#x27;s &quot;Tarzan Boy&quot; in 1985, &quot;Jeanne Mas&quot; and the 1987 Kiki Dee album &quot;Angel Eyes&quot;), but it had ceased acting as a fully functioning label.

In Australia and Germany, EMI continued using the Columbia label throughout the 1970s and to at least 1980, but added the EMI label in 1973.

== Current ownership ==
Through its ownership of the former Columbia/EMI catalogue, Parlophone Records&#x27; new owner Warner Music Group assumed Columbia&#x27;s artist roster and catalogue. New reissues bear the Parlophone imprint. Columbia&#x27;s reissues, and by extension, those from His Master&#x27;s Voice&#x27;s popular genres, are distributed by WMG&#x27;s Rhino Entertainment in the United States.

The Australian and New Zealand EMI Columbia catalogues, including recordings by John Farnham, who went by Johnny during his time with the label, were ceded to Universal Music Australia&#x27;s imprint, EMI Recorded Music Australia, and Universal Music New Zealand respectively.

<text>Deinonychus ( ; ) is a genus of dromaeosaurid theropod dinosaur with one described species, Deinonychus antirrhopus. This species, which could grow up to long, lived during the early Cretaceous Period, about 115–108 million years ago (from the mid-Aptian to early Albian stages). Fossils have been recovered from the U.S. states of Montana, Utah, Wyoming, and Oklahoma, in rocks of the Cloverly Formation and Antlers Formation, though teeth that may belong to &quot;Deinonychus&quot; have been found much farther east in Maryland.

Paleontologist John Ostrom&#x27;s study of &quot;Deinonychus&quot; in the late 1960s revolutionized the way scientists thought about dinosaurs, leading to the &quot;dinosaur renaissance&quot; and igniting the debate on whether dinosaurs were warm-blooded or cold-blooded. Before this, the popular conception of dinosaurs had been one of plodding, reptilian giants. Ostrom noted the small body, sleek, horizontal posture, ratite-like spine, and especially the enlarged raptorial claws on the feet, which suggested an active, agile predator.

&quot;Terrible claw&quot; refers to the unusually large, sickle-shaped talon on the second toe of each hind foot. The fossil YPM 5205 preserves a large, strongly curved ungual. In life, archosaurs have a horny sheath over this bone, which extends the length. Ostrom looked at crocodile and bird claws and reconstructed the claw for YPM 5205 as over long. The species name &quot;antirrhopus&quot; means &quot;counter balance&quot;, which refers to Ostrom&#x27;s idea about the function of the tail. As in other dromaeosaurids, the tail vertebrae have a series of ossified tendons and super-elongated bone processes. These features seemed to make the tail into a stiff counterbalance, but a fossil of the very closely related &quot;Velociraptor mongoliensis&quot; (&quot;IGM&quot; 100/986) has an articulated tail skeleton that is curved laterally in a long S-shape. This suggests that, in life, the tail could bend to the sides with a high degree of flexibility. In both the Cloverly and Antlers formations, &quot;Deinonychus&quot; remains have been found closely associated with those of the ornithopod &quot;Tenontosaurus&quot;. Teeth discovered associated with &quot;Tenontosaurus&quot; specimens imply they were hunted, or at least scavenged upon, by &quot;Deinonychus&quot;.

==Discovery and naming==
Fossilized remains of &quot;Deinonychus&quot; have been recovered from the Cloverly Formation of Montana and Wyoming and in the roughly contemporary Antlers Formation of Oklahoma, in North America. The Cloverly formation has been dated to the late Aptian through early Albian stages of the early Cretaceous, about 115 to 108 Ma. Additionally, teeth found in the Arundel Clay Facies (mid-Aptian), of the Potomac Formation on the Atlantic Coastal Plain of Maryland may be assigned to the genus.

The first remains were uncovered in 1931 in southern Montana near the town of Billings. The team leader, paleontologist Barnum Brown, was primarily concerned with excavating and preparing the remains of the ornithopod dinosaur &quot;Tenontosaurus&quot;, but in his field report from the dig site to the American Museum of Natural History, he reported the discovery of a small carnivorous dinosaur close to a &quot;Tenontosaurus&quot; skeleton, &quot;but encased in lime difficult to prepare.&quot; He informally called the animal &quot;Daptosaurus agilis&quot; and made preparations for describing it and having the skeleton, specimen AMNH 3015, put on display, but never finished this work. Brown brought back from the Cloverly Formation the skeleton of a smaller theropod with seemingly oversized teeth that he informally named &quot;Megadontosaurus&quot;. John Ostrom, reviewing this material decades later, realized that the teeth came from &quot;Deinonychus&quot;, but the skeleton came from a completely different animal. He named this skeleton &quot;Microvenator&quot;.

A little more than thirty years later, in August 1964, paleontologist John Ostrom led an expedition from Yale&#x27;s Peabody Museum of Natural History which discovered more skeletal material near Bridger. Expeditions during the following two summers uncovered more than 1,000 bones, among which were at least three individuals. Since the association between the various recovered bones was weak, making the exact number of individual animals represented impossible to determine properly, the type specimen (YPM 5205) of &quot;Deinonychus&quot; was restricted to the complete left foot and partial right foot that definitely belonged to the same individual. The remaining specimens were catalogued in fifty separate entries at Yale&#x27;s Peabody Museum although they could have been from as few as three individuals.

Later study by Ostrom and Grant E. Meyer analyzed their own material as well as Brown&#x27;s &quot;Daptosaurus&quot; in detail and found them to be the same species. Ostrom first published his findings in February 1969, giving all the referred remains the new name of &quot;Deinonychus antirrhopus&quot;. The specific name &quot;antirrhopus&quot;, from Greek ἀντίρροπος, means &quot;counterbalancing&quot; and refers to the likely purpose of a stiffened tail. In July 1969, Ostrom published a very extensive monograph on &quot;Deinonychus&quot;.

Though a myriad of bones was available by 1969, many important ones were missing or hard to interpret. There were few postorbital skull elements, no femurs, no sacrum, no furcula or sternum, missing vertebrae, and (Ostrom thought) only a tiny fragment of a coracoid. Ostrom&#x27;s skeletal reconstruction of &quot;Deinonychus&quot; included a very unusual pelvic bone—a pubis that was trapezoidal and flat, unlike that of other theropods, but which was the same length as the ischium and which was found right next to it.

===Further findings===

In 1974, Ostrom published another monograph on the shoulder of &quot;Deinonychus&quot; in which he realized that the pubis that he had described was actually a coracoid—a shoulder element. In that same year, another specimen of &quot;Deinonychus&quot;, MCZ 4371, was discovered and excavated in Montana by Steven Orzack during a Harvard University expedition headed by Farish Jenkins. This discovery added several new elements: well preserved femora, pubes, a sacrum, and better ilia, as well as elements of the pes and metatarsus. Ostrom described this specimen and revised his skeletal restoration of &quot;Deinonychus&quot;. This time it showed the very long pubis, and Ostrom began to suspect that they may have even been a little retroverted like those of birds.
A skeleton of &quot;Deinonychus&quot;, including bones from the original (and most complete) AMNH 3015 specimen, can be seen on display at the American Museum of Natural History, with another specimen (MCZ 4371) on display at the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University. The American Museum and Harvard specimens are from a different locality than the Yale specimens. Even these two skeletal mounts are lacking elements, including the sterna, sternal ribs, furcula, and gastralia.

Even after all Ostrom&#x27;s work, several small blocks of lime-encased material remained unprepared in storage at the American Museum. These consisted mostly of isolated bones and bone fragments, including the original matrix, or surrounding rock in which the specimens were initially buried. An examination of these unprepared blocks by Gerald Grellet-Tinner and Peter Makovicky in 2000 revealed an interesting, overlooked feature. Several long, thin bones identified on the blocks as ossified tendons (structures that helped stiffen the tail of &quot;Deinonychus&quot;) turned out to actually represent gastralia (abdominal ribs). More significantly, a large number of previously unnoticed fossilized eggshells were discovered in the rock matrix that had surrounded the original &quot;Deinonychus&quot; specimen.

In a subsequent, more detailed report, on the eggshells, Grellet-Tinner and Makovicky concluded that the egg almost certainly belonged to &quot;Deinonychus&quot;, representing the first dromaeosaurid egg to be identified. Moreover, the external surface of one eggshell was found in close contact with the gastralia suggesting that &quot;Deinonychus&quot; might have brooded its eggs. This implies that &quot;Deinonychus&quot; used body heat transfer as a mechanism for egg incubation, and indicates an endothermy similar to modern birds. Further study by Gregory Erickson and colleagues finds that this individual was 13 or 14 years old at death and its growth had plateaued. Unlike other theropods in their study of specimens found associated with eggs or nests, it had finished growing at the time of its death.

===Implications===
Ostrom&#x27;s description of &quot;Deinonychus&quot; in 1969 has been described as the most important single discovery of dinosaur paleontology in the mid-20th century. The discovery of this clearly active, agile predator did much to change the scientific (and popular) conception of dinosaurs and opened the door to speculation that some dinosaurs may have been warm-blooded. This development has been termed the dinosaur renaissance. Several years later, Ostrom noted similarities between the forefeet of &quot;Deinonychus&quot; and that of birds, an observation which led him to revive the hypothesis that birds are descended from dinosaurs. Forty years later, this idea is almost universally accepted.

Because of its extremely bird-like anatomy and close relationship to other dromaeosaurids, paleontologists hypothesize that &quot;Deinonychus&quot; was probably covered in feathers. Clear fossil evidence of modern avian-style feathers exists for several related dromaeosaurids, including &quot;Velociraptor&quot; and &quot;Microraptor&quot;, though no direct evidence is yet known for &quot;Deinonychus&quot; itself. When conducting studies of such areas as the range of motion in the forelimbs, paleontologists like Phil Senter have taken the likely presence of wing feathers (as present in all known dromaeosaurs with skin impressions) into consideration.

==Description==

Based on the few fully mature specimens, Paul estimated that &quot;Deinonychus&quot; could reach in length, with a skull length of , a hip height of and a body mass of . Campione and his colleagues proposed a higher mass estimate of based on femur and humerus circumference. The skull was equipped with powerful jaws lined with around seventy curved, blade-like teeth. Studies of the skull have progressed a great deal over the decades. Ostrom reconstructed the partial, imperfectly preserved skulls that he had as triangular, broad, and fairly similar to &quot;Allosaurus&quot;. Additional &quot;Deinonychus&quot; skull material and closely related species found with good three-dimensional preservation show that the palate was more vaulted than Ostrom thought, making the snout far narrower, while the jugals flared broadly, giving greater stereoscopic vision. The skull of &quot;Deinonychus&quot; was different from that of &quot;Velociraptor&quot;, however, in that it had a more robust skull roof, like that of &quot;Dromaeosaurus&quot;, and did not have the depressed nasals of &quot;Velociraptor&quot;. Both the skull and the lower jaw had fenestrae (skull openings) which reduced the weight of the skull. In &quot;Deinonychus&quot;, the antorbital fenestra, a skull opening between the eye and nostril, was particularly large.

&quot;Deinonychus&quot; possessed large &quot;hands&quot; (manus) with three claws on each forelimb. The first digit was shortest and the second was longest. Each hind foot bore a sickle-shaped claw on the second digit, which was probably used during predation.

No skin impressions have ever been found in association with fossils of &quot;Deinonychus&quot;. Nonetheless, the evidence suggests that the Dromaeosauridae, including &quot;Deinonychus&quot;, had feathers. The genus &quot;Microraptor&quot; is both older geologically and more primitive phylogenetically than &quot;Deinonychus&quot;, and within the same family. Multiple fossils of &quot;Microraptor&quot; preserve pennaceous, vaned feathers like those of modern birds on the arms, legs, and tail, along with covert and contour feathers. &quot;Velociraptor&quot; is geologically younger than &quot;Deinonychus&quot;, but even more closely related. A specimen of &quot;Velociraptor&quot; has been found with quill knobs on the ulna. Quill knobs are where the follicular ligaments attached, and are a direct indicator of feathers of modern aspect.

==Classification==
&quot;Deinonychus antirrhopus&quot; is one of the best known dromaeosaurid species, and also a close relative of the smaller &quot;Velociraptor&quot;, which is found in younger, Late Cretaceous-age rock formations in Central Asia. The clade they form is called Velociraptorinae. The subfamily name Velociraptorinae was first coined by Rinchen Barsbold in 1983 and originally contained the single genus &quot;Velociraptor&quot;. Later, Phil Currie included most of the dromaeosaurids. Two Late Cretaceous genera, &quot;Tsaagan&quot; from Mongolia and the North American &quot;Saurornitholestes&quot;, may also be close relatives, but the latter is poorly known and hard to classify. &quot;Velociraptor&quot; and its allies are regarded as using their claws more than their skulls as killing tools, as opposed to dromaeosaurines like &quot;Dromaeosaurus&quot;, which have stockier skulls. Phylogenetically, the dromaeosaurids represent one of the non-avialan dinosaur groups most closely related to birds. The cladogram below follows a 2015 analysis by paleontologists Robert DePalma, David Burnham, Larry Martin, Peter Larson, and Robert Bakker, using updated data from the Theropod Working Group. This study currently classifies &quot;Deinonychus&quot; as a member of the Dromaeosaurinae.
 
A 2021 study of the dromaeosaurid &quot;Kansaignathus&quot; recovered &quot;Deinonychus&quot; as a velociraptorine rather than a dromaeosaurine, with &quot;Kansaignathus&quot; being an intermediate basal form more advanced than &quot;Deinonychus&quot; but more primitive than &quot;Velociraptor&quot;. The cladogram below showcases these newly described relationships: 
A study in 2022, however, reclassified &quot;Deinonychus&quot; as a basal member of Dromaeosaurinae again.

==Paleobiology==

===Predatory behavior===

In 2009, Manning and colleagues interpreted dromaeosaur claw tips as functioning as a puncture and gripping element, whereas the expanded rear portion of the claw transferred load stress through the structure. They argue that the anatomy, form, and function of the foot&#x27;s recurved digit II and hand claws of dromaeosaurs support a prey capture/grappling/climbing function. The team also suggest that a ratchet-like ‘‘locking’’ ligament might have provided an energy-efficient way for dromaeosaurs to hook their recurved digit II claw into prey. Shifting body weight locked the claws passively, allowing their jaws to dispatch prey. They conclude that the enhanced climbing abilities of dromaeosaur dinosaurs supported a scansorial (climbing) phase in the evolution of flight. 

In 2011, Denver Fowler and colleagues suggested a new method by which &quot;Deinonychus&quot; and other dromaeosaurs may have captured and restrained prey. This model, known as the &quot;raptor prey restraint&quot; (RPR) model of predation, proposes that &quot;Deinonychus&quot; killed its prey in a manner very similar to extant accipitrid birds of prey: by leaping onto its quarry, pinning it under its body weight, and gripping it tightly with the large, sickle-shaped claws. Like accipitrids, the dromaeosaur would then begin to feed on the animal while still alive, until it eventually died from blood loss and organ failure. This proposal is based primarily on comparisons between the morphology and proportions of the feet and legs of dromaeosaurs to several groups of extant birds of prey with known predatory behaviors. Fowler found that the feet and legs of dromaeosaurs most closely resemble those of eagles and hawks, especially in terms of having an enlarged second claw and a similar range of grasping motion. However, the short metatarsus and foot strength would have been more similar to that of owls. The RPR method of predation would be consistent with other aspects of &quot;Deinonychus&quot;&#x27;s anatomy, such as their unusual jaw and arm morphology. The arms were likely covered in long feathers, and may have been used as flapping stabilizers for balance while atop struggling prey, along with the stiff counterbalancing tail. Its jaws, thought to have had a comparatively weak bite force, might be used for saw motion bites, like the modern Komodo dragon which also has a weak bite force, to finish off its prey if its kicks were not powerful enough. In 2020, Mark Powers and colleagues analyzed the snout morphology of dromaeosaurids from North America and Asia, their findings suggest that the maxilla of &quot;Deinonychus&quot; was short and deep, resembling that of short-snouted canids, suggesting that &quot;Deinonychus&quot; specialized on larger prey.

====Bite force====

Bite force estimates for &quot;Deinonychus&quot; were first produced in 2005, based on reconstructed jaw musculature. This study concluded that &quot;Deinonychus&quot; likely had a maximum bite force only 15% that of the modern American alligator. A 2010 study by Paul Gignac and colleagues attempted to estimate the bite force based directly on newly discovered &quot;Deinonychus&quot; tooth puncture marks in the bones of a &quot;Tenontosaurus&quot;. These puncture marks came from a large individual, and provided the first evidence that large &quot;Deinonychus&quot; could bite through bone. Using the tooth marks, Gignac&#x27;s team were able to determine that the bite force of &quot;Deinonychus&quot; was significantly higher than earlier studies had estimated by biomechanical studies alone. They found the bite force of &quot;Deinonychus&quot; to be between 4,100 and 8,200 newtons, greater than living carnivorous mammals including the hyena, and equivalent to a similarly-sized alligator.

However, this estimate has come into question, as it was based on bite marks rather than a &quot;Deinonychus&quot; skull. A recent 2022 study used a &quot;Deinonychus&quot; skull for their estimate and calculated .

Gignac and colleagues also noted, however, that bone puncture marks from &quot;Deinonychus&quot; are relatively rare, and unlike larger theropods with many known puncture marks like &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, &quot;Deinonychus&quot; probably did not frequently bite through or eat bone. Instead, they probably used their strong bite force for defense or to capture prey, rather than for feeding. 

A 2024 study by Tse, Miller, and Pittman et al., focusing on the skull morphology and bite forces of various dromaeosaurids discovered that &quot;Deinonychus&quot;, the largest taxon examined, had a skull that was well adapted to hunting of large vertebrates and delivering powerful bites to prey alongside &quot;Dromaeosaurus&quot;, to which it was compared. In this study, &quot;Deinonychus&quot; represented the most extreme specializations compared to other dromaeosaurids when it came to its adaptations. The same study also revealed that &quot;Deinonychus&quot;&#x27; skull was less resistant to bite forces than that of &quot;Velociraptor&quot;, which apparently was engaging in more scavenging behavior, suggesting high bite force resistance was more common in dromaeosaurid taxa that were obtaining food through scavenging more than engaging in active predation. It is also suggested in these findings that Deinonychus may have fed by using neck-driven pullback movements to dismember carcasses when feeding, akin to modern varanid lizards.

====Limb function====

Despite being the most distinctive feature of &quot;Deinonychus&quot;, the shape and curvature of the sickle claw varies between specimens. The type specimen described by Ostrom in 1969 has a strongly curved sickle claw, while a newer specimen described in 1976 had a claw with much weaker curvature, more similar in profile with the &#x27;normal&#x27; claws on the remaining toes. Ostrom suggested that this difference in the size and shape of the sickle claws could be due to individual, sexual, or age-related variation, but admitted he could not be sure.

There is anatomical and trackway evidence that this talon was held up off the ground while the dinosaur walked on the third and fourth toes.

Ostrom suggested that &quot;Deinonychus&quot; could kick with the sickle claw to cut and slash at its prey. Some researchers even suggested that the talon was used to disembowel large ceratopsian dinosaurs. Other studies have suggested that the sickle claws were not used to slash but rather to deliver small stabs to the victim. In 2005, Manning and colleagues ran tests on a robotic replica that precisely matched the anatomy of &quot;Deinonychus&quot; and &quot;Velociraptor&quot;, and used hydraulic rams to make the robot strike a pig carcass. In these tests, the talons made only shallow punctures and could not cut or slash. The authors suggested that the talons would have been more effective in climbing than in dealing killing blows. In 2009, Manning and colleagues undertook additional analysis dromaeosaur claw function, using a numerical modelling approach to generate a 3D finite element stress/ strain map of a Velociraptor hand claw. They went on to quantitatively evaluate the mechanical behavior of dromaeosaur claws and their function. They state that dromaeosaur claws were well-adapted for climbing as they were resistant to forces acting in a single (longitudinal) plane, due to gravity.

Ostrom compared &quot;Deinonychus&quot; to the ostrich and cassowary. He noted that the bird species can inflict serious injury with the large claw on the second toe. The cassowary has claws up to long. Ostrom cited Gilliard (1958) in saying that they can sever an arm or disembowel a man. Kofron (1999 and 2003) studied 241 documented cassowary attacks and found that one human and two dogs had been killed, but no evidence that cassowaries can disembowel or dismember other animals. Cassowaries use their claws to defend themselves, to attack threatening animals, and in agonistic displays such as the Bowed Threat Display. The seriema also has an enlarged second toe claw, and uses it to tear apart small prey items for swallowing. In 2011, a study suggested that the sickle claw would likely have been used to pin down prey while biting it, rather than as a slashing weapon.
Biomechanical studies by Ken Carpenter in 2002 confirmed that the most likely function of the forelimbs in predation was grasping, as their great lengths would have permitted longer reach than for most other theropods. The rather large and elongated coracoid, indicating powerful muscles in the forelimbs, further strengthened this interpretation. Carpenter&#x27;s biomechanical studies using bone casts also showed that &quot;Deinonychus&quot; could not fold its arms against its body like a bird (&quot;avian folding&quot;), contrary to what was inferred from the earlier 1985 descriptions by Jacques Gauthier and Gregory S. Paul in 1988.

Studies by Phil Senter in 2006 indicated that &quot;Deinonychus&quot; forelimbs could be used not only for grasping, but also for clutching objects towards the chest. If &quot;Deinonychus&quot; had feathered fingers and wings, the feathers would have limited the range of motion of the forelimbs to some degree. For example, when &quot;Deinonychus&quot; extended its arm forward, the &#x27;palm&#x27; of the hand automatically rotated to an upward-facing position. This would have caused one wing to block the other if both forelimbs were extended at the same time, leading Senter to conclude that clutching objects to the chest would have only been accomplished with one arm at a time. The function of the fingers would also have been limited by feathers; for example, only the third digit of the hand could have been employed in activities such as probing crevices for small prey items, and only in a position perpendicular to the main wing. Alan Gishlick, in a 2001 study of &quot;Deinonychus&quot; forelimb mechanics, found that even if large wing feathers were present, the grasping ability of the hand would not have been significantly hindered; rather, grasping would have been accomplished perpendicular to the wing, and objects likely would have been held by both hands simultaneously in a &quot;bear hug&quot; fashion, findings which have been supported by the later forelimb studies by Carpenter and Senter. In a 2001 study conducted by Bruce Rothschild and other paleontologists, 43 hand bones and 52 foot bones referred to &quot;Deinonychus&quot; were examined for signs of stress fracture; none were found. The second phalanx of the second toe in the specimen YPM 5205 has a healed fracture.
Parsons and Parsons have shown that juvenile and sub-adult specimens of &quot;Deinonychus&quot; display some morphological differences from the adults. For instance, the arms of the younger specimens were proportionally longer than those of the adults, a possible indication of difference in behavior between young and adults. Another example of this could be the function of the pedal claws. Parsons and Parsons have suggested that the claw curvature (which Ostrom [1976] had already shown was different between specimens) maybe was greater for juvenile &quot;Deinonychus&quot;, as this could help it climb in trees, and that the claws became straighter as the animal became older and started to live solely on the ground. This was based on the hypothesis that some small dromaeosaurids used their pedal claws for climbing.

===Locomotion===
Dromaeosaurids, especially &quot;Deinonychus&quot;, are often depicted as unusually fast-running animals in the popular media, and Ostrom himself speculated that &quot;Deinonychus&quot; was fleet-footed in his original description. However, when first described, a complete leg of &quot;Deinonychus&quot; had not been found, and Ostrom&#x27;s speculation about the length of the femur (upper leg bone) later proved to have been an overestimate. In a later study, Ostrom noted that the ratio of the femur to the tibia (lower leg bone) is not as important in determining speed as the relative length of the foot and lower leg. In modern fleet-footed birds, like the ostrich, the foot-tibia ratio is .95. In unusually fast-running dinosaurs, like &quot;Struthiomimus&quot;, the ratio is .68, but in &quot;Deinonychus&quot; the ratio is .48. Ostrom stated that the &quot;only reasonable conclusion&quot; is that &quot;Deinonychus&quot;, while far from slow-moving, was not particularly fast compared to other dinosaurs, and certainly not as fast as modern flightless birds.

The low foot to lower leg ratio in &quot;Deinonychus&quot; is due partly to an unusually short metatarsus (upper foot bones). The ratio is actually larger in smaller individuals than in larger ones. Ostrom suggested that the short metatarsus may be related to the function of the sickle claw, and used the fact that it appears to get shorter as individuals aged as support for this. He interpreted all these features—the short second toe with enlarged claw, short metatarsus, etc.—as support for the use of the hind leg as an offensive weapon, where the sickle claw would strike downwards and backwards, and the leg pulled back and down at the same time, slashing and tearing at the prey. Ostrom suggested that the short metatarsus reduced overall stress on the leg bones during such an attack, and interpreted the unusual arrangement of muscle attachments in the &quot;Deinonychus&quot; leg as support for his idea that a different set of muscles was used in the predatory stroke than in walking or running. Therefore, Ostrom concluded that the legs of &quot;Deinonychus&quot; represented a balance between running adaptations needed for an agile predator, and stress-reducing features to compensate for its unique foot weapon.
In his 1981 study of Canadian dinosaur footprints, Richard Kool produced rough walking speed estimates based on several trackways made by different species in the Gething Formation of British Columbia. Kool estimated one of these trackways, representing the ichnospecies &quot;Irenichnites gracilis&quot; (which may have been made by &quot;Deinonychus&quot;), to have a walking speed of 10.1 kilometers per hour (6 miles per hour).

In a 2015 paper, it was reported after further analysis of immature fossils that the open and mobile nature of the shoulder joint might have meant that young &quot;Deinonychus&quot; were capable of some form of flight.

===Eggs===

The identification, in 2000, of a probable &quot;Deinonychus&quot; egg associated with one of the original specimens allowed comparison with other theropod dinosaurs in terms of egg structure, nesting, and reproduction. In their 2006 examination of the specimen, Grellet-Tinner and Makovicky examined the possibility that the dromaeosaurid had been feeding on the egg, or that the egg fragments had been associated with the &quot;Deinonychus&quot; skeleton by coincidence. They dismissed the idea that the egg had been a meal for the theropod, noting that the fragments were sandwiched between the belly ribs and forelimb bones, making it impossible that they represented contents of the animal&#x27;s stomach. In addition, the manner in which the egg had been crushed and fragmented indicated that it had been intact at the time of burial, and was broken by the fossilization process. The idea that the egg was randomly associated with the dinosaur was also found to be unlikely; the bones surrounding the egg had not been scattered or disarticulated, but remained fairly intact relative to their positions in life, indicating that the area around and including the egg was not disturbed during preservation. The fact that these bones were belly ribs (gastralia), which are very rarely found articulated, supported this interpretation. All the evidence, according to Grellet-Tinner and Makovicky, indicates that the egg was intact beneath the body of the &quot;Deinonychus&quot; when it was buried. It is possible that this represents brooding or nesting behavior in &quot;Deinonychus&quot; similar to that seen in the related troodontids and oviraptorids, or that the egg was in fact inside the oviduct when the animal died.

Examination of the &quot;Deinonychus&quot; egg&#x27;s microstructure confirms that it belonged to a theropod, since it shares characteristics with other known theropod eggs and shows dissimilarities with ornithischian and sauropod eggs. Compared to other maniraptoran theropods, the egg of &quot;Deinonychus&quot; is more similar to those of oviraptorids than to those of troodontids, despite studies that show the latter are more closely related to dromaeosaurids like &quot;Deinonychus&quot;. While the egg was too badly crushed to accurately determine its size, Grellet-Tinner and Makovicky estimated a diameter of about based on the width of the pelvic canal through which the egg had to have passed. This size is similar to the diameter of the largest &quot;Citipati&quot; (an oviraptorid) eggs; &quot;Citipati&quot; and &quot;Deinonychus&quot; also shared the same overall body size, supporting this estimate. Additionally, the thicknesses of &quot;Citipati&quot; and &quot;Deinonychus&quot; eggshells are almost identical, and since shell thickness correlates with egg volume, this further supports the idea that the eggs of these two animals were about the same size.

A study published in November 2018 by Norell, Yang and Wiemann et al., indicates that &quot;Deinonychus&quot; laid blue eggs, likely to camouflage them as well as creating open nests. The study also indicates that &quot;Deinonychus&quot; and other dinosaurs that created open nests likely represent an origin of color in modern bird eggs as an adaptation both for recognition and camouflage against predators.

===Social behavior===
Scientists have debated whether or not &quot;Deinonychus&quot; was gregarious.

&quot;Deinonychus&quot; teeth found in association with fossils of the ornithopod dinosaur &quot;Tenontosaurus&quot; are quite common in the Cloverly Formation. Two quarries have been discovered that preserve fairly complete &quot;Deinonychus&quot; fossils near &quot;Tenontosaurus&quot; fossils. The first, the Yale quarry in the Cloverly of Montana, includes numerous teeth, four adult &quot;Deinonychus&quot; and one juvenile &quot;Deinonychus&quot;. The association of this number of &quot;Deinonychus&quot; skeletons in a single quarry suggests that &quot;Deinonychus&quot; may have fed on that animal, and perhaps hunted it. Ostrom and Maxwell have even used this information to speculate that &quot;Deinonychus&quot; might have lived and hunted in packs. The second such quarry is from the Antlers Formation of Oklahoma. The site contains six partial skeletons of &quot;Tenontosaurus&quot; of various sizes, along with one partial skeleton and many teeth of &quot;Deinonychus&quot;. One tenontosaur humerus even bears what might be &quot;Deinonychus&quot; tooth marks. Brinkman &quot;et al.&quot; (1998) point out that &quot;Deinonychus&quot; had an adult mass of , whereas adult tenontosaurs were 1–4 metric tons. A solitary &quot;Deinonychus&quot; could not kill an adult tenontosaur, suggesting that pack hunting is possible.

A 2007 study by Roach and Brinkman has called into question the cooperative pack hunting behavior of &quot;Deinonychus&quot;, based on what is known of modern carnivore hunting and the taphonomy of tenontosaur sites. Modern archosaurs (birds and crocodiles) and Komodo dragons typically display little cooperative hunting; instead, they are usually either solitary hunters, or are drawn to previously killed carcasses, where much conflict occurs between individuals of the same species. For example, in situations where groups of Komodo dragons are eating together, the largest individuals eat first and will attack smaller Komodos that attempt to feed; if the smaller animal is killed, it is cannibalized. When this information is applied to the tenontosaur sites, it appears that what is found is consistent with &quot;Deinonychus&quot; having a Komodo or crocodile-like feeding strategy. &quot;Deinonychus&quot; skeletal remains found at these sites are from subadults, with missing parts consistent with having been eaten by other &quot;Deinonychus&quot;. 

On the other hand, a paper by Li &quot;et al.&quot; describes track sites with similar foot spacing and parallel trackways, implying gregarious packing behavior instead of uncoordinated feeding behavior. Contrary to the claim crocodilians do not hunt cooperatively, they have actually been observed to hunt cooperatively, even going as far as individuals serving different roles during the hunt. Meaning that the notion of infighting, competition for food and cannibalism ruling out cooperative feeding may actually be a false dichotomy.

In 2020, a study of carbon isotopes in &quot;Deinonychus&quot; teeth suggests precociality in the genus. The isotopes found for different aged specimens indicate that adults and juveniles had different diets across the various age groups, suggesting a more typical archosaurian set of life stages, with any parental feeding of young ending before the young were large enough to sustain the typical adult diet. The examinations also suggests a lack of mammal-like pack hunting in &quot;Deinonychus&quot;. However, the authors still suggest gregariousness in some dromaeosaurids such as &quot;Deinonychus&quot; and they probably practiced ratite-like parental care, instead of a complete agnostic relationship as seen in Komodo dragons, as argued by Roach and Brinkman 2007, due to the lack of spatial separation of juveniles and adults.

==Paleoenvironment==

Geological evidence suggests that &quot;Deinonychus&quot; inhabited a floodplain or swamplike habitat. The paleoenvironment of both the upper Cloverly Formation and the Antlers Formation, in which remains of &quot;Deinonychus&quot; have been found, consisted of tropical or sub-tropical forests, deltas and lagoons, perhaps similar to the environment of modern-day Louisiana.
Other animals &quot;Deinonychus&quot; shared its world with include herbivorous dinosaurs such as the nodosaurid &quot;Sauropelta&quot; and the ornithopods &quot;Zephyrosaurus&quot; and &quot;Tenontosaurus&quot;. In Oklahoma, the ecosystem of &quot;Deinonychus&quot; also included the large theropod &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot;, the huge sauropod &quot;Sauroposeidon&quot;, the crocodilians &quot;Goniopholis&quot; and &quot;Paluxysuchus&quot;, and the gar &quot;Lepisosteus&quot;. If the teeth found in Maryland are those of &quot;Deinonychus&quot;, then its contemporaries would include the sauropod &quot;Astrodon&quot; and the poorly-known nodosaur &quot;Priconodon&quot;. The middle portion of the Cloverly Formation ranges in age from 115 ± 10 Ma near the base to 108.5 ± 0.2 Ma near the top.

==Cultural significance==

&quot;Deinonychus&quot; were featured prominently in Harry Adam Knight&#x27;s novel &quot;Carnosaur&quot; and its film adaption, and Michael Crichton&#x27;s novels &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; and &quot;The Lost World&quot; and their film adaptations, directed by Steven Spielberg. Crichton ultimately chose to use the name &quot;Velociraptor&quot; for these dinosaurs, rather than &quot;Deinonychus&quot;. Crichton had met with John Ostrom several times during the writing process to discuss details of the possible range of behaviors and life appearance of &quot;Deinonychus&quot;. Crichton at one point apologetically told Ostrom that he had decided to use the name &quot;Velociraptor&quot; in place of &quot;Deinonychus&quot; for his book, because he felt the former name was &quot;more dramatic&quot;. Despite this, according to Ostrom, Crichton stated that the &quot;Velociraptor&quot; of the novel was based on &quot;Deinonychus&quot; in almost every detail, and that only the name had been changed.

The &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; filmmakers followed suit, designing the film&#x27;s models based almost entirely on &quot;Deinonychus&quot; instead of the actual &quot;Velociraptor&quot;, and they reportedly requested all of Ostrom&#x27;s published papers on &quot;Deinonychus&quot; during production. As a result, they portrayed the film&#x27;s dinosaurs with the size, proportions, and snout shape of &quot;Deinonychus&quot;. The &quot;Utahraptor&quot; is commonly considered to be a close match to the film&#x27;s dinosaurs, which are much larger than either &quot;Deinonychus&quot; or &quot;Velociraptor&quot; were in life.

<text>In finance, a forward rate agreement (FRA) is an interest rate derivative (IRD). In particular, it is a linear IRD with strong associations with interest rate swaps (IRSs).

==General description==

A forward rate agreement&#x27;s (FRA&#x27;s) effective description is a cash for difference derivative contract, between two parties, benchmarked against an interest rate index. That index is commonly an interbank offered rate (-IBOR) of specific tenor in different currencies, for example LIBOR in USD, GBP, EURIBOR in EUR or STIBOR in SEK. An FRA between two counterparties requires a fixed rate, notional amount, chosen interest rate index tenor and date to be completely specified.

==Extended description==

Forward rate agreements (FRAs) are interconnected with short term interest rate futures (STIR futures). Because STIR futures settle against the same index as a subset of FRAs, IMM FRAs, their pricing is related. The nature of each product has a distinctive gamma (convexity) profile resulting in rational, no arbitrage, pricing adjustments. This adjustment is called futures convexity adjustment (FCA) and is usually expressed in basis points.

Interest rate swaps (IRSs) are often considered a series of FRAs but this view is technically incorrect due to differences in calculation methodologies in cash payments and this results in very small pricing differences.

FRAs are not loans, and do not constitute agreements to loan any amount of money on an unsecured basis to another party at any pre-agreed rate. Their nature as an IRD product creates only the effect of leverage and the ability to speculate, or hedge, interest rate risk exposure.

==Valuation and pricing==
The cash for difference value on an FRA, exchanged between the two parties, calculated from the perspective of having sold an FRA (which imitates receiving the fixed rate) is calculated as:

:formula_1

where formula_2 is the notional of the contract, formula_3 is the fixed rate, formula_4 is the published -IBOR fixing rate and formula_5 is the decimalised day count fraction over which the value start and end dates of the -IBOR rate extend. For USD and EUR this follows an ACT/360 convention and GBP follows an ACT/365 convention. The cash amount is paid on the value start date applicable to the interest rate index (depending in which currency the FRA is traded, this is either immediately after or within two business days of the published -IBOR fixing rate).

For mark-to-market (MTM) purposes the net present value (PV) of an FRA can be determined by discounting the expected cash difference, for a forecast value formula_4:

:formula_7

where formula_8 is the discount factor of the payment date upon which the cash for difference is physically settled, which, in modern pricing theory, will be dependent upon which discount curve to apply based on the credit support annex (CSA) of the derivative contract.

==Uses and risks==

Many banks and large corporations will use FRAs to hedge future interest or exchange rate exposure. The buyer hedges against the risk of rising interest rates, while the seller hedges against the risk of falling interest rates. Other parties that use forward rate agreements are speculators purely looking to make bets on future directional changes in interest rates. The development of swaps in the 1980s provided organisations with an alternative to FRAs for hedging and speculating.

In other words, a forward rate agreement (FRA) is a tailor-made, over-the-counter financial futures contract on short-term deposits. A FRA transaction is a contract between two parties to exchange payments on a deposit, called the &quot;Notional amount&quot;, to be determined on the basis of a short-term interest rate,
referred to as the &quot;Reference rate&quot;, over a predetermined time period at a future date. FRA transactions are entered as a hedge against interest rate changes. The buyer of the contract locks in the interest rate in an effort to protect against an interest rate increase, while the seller protects against a possible interest rate decline. At maturity, no funds exchange hands; rather, the
difference between the contracted interest rate and the market rate is exchanged. The buyer of the contract is paid if the published reference rate is above the fixed, contracted rate, and the buyer pays to the seller if the published reference rate is below the fixed, contracted rate. A company that seeks to hedge against a possible increase in interest rates would purchase FRAs, whereas a company that seeks an interest hedge against a possible decline of the rates would sell FRAs.

==Quotation and market-making==
FRA Descriptive Notation and Interpretation
How to interpret a quote for FRA?

[US$ 3x9 − 3.25/3.50%p.a ] – means deposit interest starting 3 months from now for 6 months is 3.25% and borrowing interest rate
starting 3 months from now for 6 months is 3.50% (see also bid–ask spread). Entering a &quot;payer FRA&quot; means paying the fixed rate (3.50% p.a.) and receiving a floating 6-month rate, while entering a &quot;receiver FRA&quot; means paying the same floating rate and receiving a fixed rate (3.25% p.a.).

This information on the notation on FRAs is consistent with the material presented in this citation. This text goes on to specify the additional property of a FRA&#x27;s &#x27;roll-day&#x27; which describes which day of the month (from 1 to 31) that the FRA&#x27;s value start date is effective from.

<text>Tsushima Maru () was a Japanese passenger/cargo ship that was sunk by the submarine USS &quot;Bowfin&quot; during World War II, while carrying hundreds of schoolchildren from Okinawa to Nagasaki.

==Events==
&quot;Tsushima Maru&quot; was carrying a large number of Japanese civilians evacuating from Okinawa to Kagoshima in compliance with government orders to prepare for an invasion of the Ryukyu Islands. The passengers were primarily school-aged children, as well as a few parents and school teachers. The ship was estimated to have carried 1,788 passengers, of whom only 254 survived. 1,534 passengers and crew died including 780 of the schoolchildren. Just 59 young boys and girls survived.

==Sinking==
On August 22, 1944, at between 10:00 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. local time, USS &quot;Bowfin&quot; attacked the convoy in which &quot;Tsushima Maru&quot; was sailing and sank her, close to the island of Akusekijima. Tsushima Maru Commemoration Association Survey Data (As of August 27, 2005), reported a total of 1,661 civilian evacuees, including 834 schoolchildren (of whom 775 were killed and approximately 59 survived the sinking). Shortly after the sinking a &quot;gag order&quot; was enforced by the Japanese government and families and survivors rarely spoke about the incident. The number of victims that have been identified by name, based on notifications from bereaved families (As of August 22, 2012), include 780 schoolchildren.

The ship was part of Convoy Namo 103, which consisted of the following ships:
* &quot;Tsushima Maru&quot; (passenger / cargo vessel)
* &quot;Kazuura Maru&quot; (listed as &quot;Waura Maru&quot; in some sources, assumed to be a cargo vessel)
* &quot;Gyōkū Maru&quot; (cargo vessel)
* Destroyer &quot;Hasu&quot; (&quot;Momi&quot; class)
* Gunboat &quot;Uji&quot;

== Aftermath ==

The wreck was located and identified in December 1997.

The sinking has been the subject of many articles and books published in Japan, as well as a good number of documentary broadcasts and even an animated feature film. Memorial ceremonies are held at sea at the approximate location of the sinking, and there are monuments in Naha City, Okinawa, Akuseki Island and Amami Island (Funakoshi beach) for those lost at sea.
== Museum ==
Photos of identified students are on display at the Tsushima-maru Memorial Museum in Naha, Okinawa.
