<text>Police Quest (or SWAT) is a series of police simulation video games produced and published by Sierra On-Line between 1987 and 1998. The first five were adventure simulation games, the first three of which were designed by former police officer Jim Walls. The fourth to sixth titles were designed by former LAPD Chief Daryl F. Gates. Both &quot;SWAT&quot; and the real-time tactics game &quot;SWAT 2&quot; still carried the &quot;Police Quest&quot; name and were numbered V and VI in the series, respectively, although subsequent titles in the series would drop the &quot;Police Quest&quot; title altogether and were rebranded as &quot;SWAT&quot;.

== Games ==
=== By Jim Walls (PQ 1–3) ===

The first three games were produced by former police officer Jim Walls and follow the adventures of Sonny Bonds, a character whose name and appearance was loosely based on his own son, Sonny Walls. Jim Walls makes a cameo appearance in each game, typically in the introduction.
;&quot;Police Quest: In Pursuit of the Death Angel&quot;

Released in 1987 using Sierra&#x27;s Adventure Game Interpreter parser engine, &quot;Police Quest&quot; casts the player as Sonny Bonds, a 15-year veteran police officer in the fictional town of Lytton, California. Assigned to traffic duty, Sonny investigates what appears to be a simple car crash but turns out to be a homicide. Relieved by his supervisor, Sergeant Dooley, Sonny goes on a short coffee break with a fellow officer and returns to duty. He gives a traffic violation citation to a driver, single-handedly faces a tough gang of drunken bikers, and makes a DUI arrest. As the game progresses, he advances from patrol officer to temporary narcotics detective to undercover agent in hope of tracking down a murderous drug dealer named Jessie Bains, &quot;The Death Angel&quot;. In order to find Jessie Bains, Sonny enlists the help of his former high school sweetheart, &quot;Sweet Cheeks&quot; Marie, who is now working as a prostitute.

The game is the most realistic of those developed by Sierra in the late 1980s when compared to &quot;Leisure Suit Larry&quot;, &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot;, or &quot;Space Quest&quot;, and featured many puzzles where proper police procedure is required to succeed. It was released for MS-DOS, Apple II, Mac, Amiga, Atari ST and Apple II. A SCI1.1 enhanced remake in 256 color VGA was released in 1992, which was also the first game released in the series not to feature dead ends.

;&quot;Police Quest II: The Vengeance&quot;

Released in 1988 and running on the then-current SCI0 engine, the game once again casts the player as officer Sonny Bonds. After arresting Jessie Bains, Bonds is permanently promoted to the homicide division. He begins dating Marie Wilkans, who helped him in his undercover work in exchange for the dismissal of prostitution charges against her as &quot;Sweet Cheeks&quot; Marie. A dark shadow is cast over Sonny&#x27;s happy life, however, when Bains escapes from prison and seeks revenge. With the help of his partner Keith, Bonds must protect his girlfriend&#x27;s life as well as his own while pursuing &quot;The Death Angel&quot; once again. Despite Sonny&#x27;s efforts, Bains kills several people who were involved in his arrest and abducts Marie. Sonny pursues Bains to Steelton, the current home of Donald Colby, a reformed drug pusher from the original &quot;Police Quest&quot;.

&quot;Police Quest II&quot; is notably more &quot;mature&quot; than the first title in the series and relies much more on proper procedure. Failure to properly maintain Sonny&#x27;s firearm at various points throughout the game will cause it to malfunction or misfire, and proceeding into a dangerous situation without proper backup will usually prove fatal.

;&quot;Police Quest III: The Kindred&quot;

Sonny and Marie are married following Bains&#x27; death. Promoted once more, Sonny now has to deal with rampant crime as a drug cartel begins operating in Lytton and evidence of a satanic cult starts to appear. However, when Marie is stabbed in a mall parking lot, Sonny&#x27;s police work becomes personal.

Sonny must deal with a partner with questionable ethics as well as find patterns in crime to find his next lead. The Bains family also plays a role in this game.

Released in 1991 for SCI version 1, &quot;PQ3&quot; is completely mouse-driven. It was only released for the IBM PC and the Amiga. Before the completion of this game, Jim Walls had left Sierra for reasons that have still not been publicly explained, leaving Jane Jensen to finish the final in-game dialogue and messages. SWAT founder Daryl F. Gates was named to take over the &quot;Police Quest&quot; series while Walls, along with several former Sierra employees, would go on to design Blue Force, an adventure game similar to the &quot;Police Quest&quot; series.

=== By Daryl F. Gates (PQ 4–6) ===
The later games in the series were designed by Tammy Dargan and produced by former L.A. Chief Daryl Gates, in a different style in both atmosphere, and later even in genre. Like the original series by Jim Walls, Daryl Gates makes cameo appearances in each game. &quot;Police Quest IV&quot; and &quot;V&quot; were later spun off into the &quot;SWAT&quot; series. Unlike the earlier games in the series, these were listed as &quot;Daryl F Gates&#x27; Police Quest&quot;, rather than being a numbered series (the numbered titles were still used in packaging and printed material included with the compilation CDs).

;&quot;Police Quest: Open Season&quot;

Daryl F. Gates&#x27; first game for Sierra departed completely from the style of the previous games. The player was no longer cast as Sonny Bonds, but as John Carey; the action was no longer in fictional Lytton, but in Los Angeles, California. Carey, an LAPD homicide detective whose best friend was killed in the line of duty, must track down a serial murderer in L.A.

Numerous mature themes are depicted in the game, including hate crimes, Neo-Nazism, and youth involved in crime. Graphic imagery within the game also includes the body of a child murdered by gang violence and a severed head in a refrigerator.

Using SCI2 the game replaced from earlier games with scanned photos as backgrounds, and live actors filmed from green screen as character sprites. It was released in 1993, for both IBM PC and Macintosh. The game is generally incompatible with Windows 95, and later editions; the game may crash at certain points in the game, e.g. the shooting gallery and the shoot out. This, however, was fixed with the release of the CD version with Windows installer.

This game is the most &quot;mature&quot; of the &quot;Police Quest&quot; series of games; while previously only a peripheral element, the themes of drug abuse, police corruption and gang violence play prominent roles in this game. Police procedure is less of an element in the game, pushed aside for the sake of storytelling.

;&quot;Police Quest: SWAT&quot;
Although the game is not referred to as PQV in the title screen, it is referred to as such in several other locations in the game including the files, and the game credits, and certain versions of the packaging near the ISBN/barcode and documentation. &quot;Police Quest 5: SWAT&quot; was re-released as part of the second &quot;Police Quest Collection&quot;, and later as part of the &quot;Police Quest: SWAT Force&quot;, &quot;SWAT Career Pack&quot; (which included all six PQ games), and &quot;Police Quest: SWAT Generation&quot; compilations.

;&quot;Police Quest: SWAT 2&quot;

&quot;Police Quest: SWAT 2&quot; is the sixth and final game of the original &quot;Police Quest&quot; series. It is a real-time strategy game using an original game engine. It retained only a few adventure game elements in the form of an inventory and use of a few &quot;puzzle&quot; items such as a pizza (to draw a suspect out of a house), and similar interface (look/search icon, pickup/hand icon, communication/talk/challenge icon, etc.). It is referred to as PQ6 in a few locations including its files. Sonny Bonds is one of the agents the player may employ in the game. It was included as part of the &quot;Police Quest: SWAT Force&quot; and &quot;Police Quest: SWAT Generation&quot; compilations.

=== PC-based &quot;SWAT&quot; shooters (SWAT 3-4) ===
Although the &quot;Police Quest&quot; series continued after &quot;Open Season&quot; for two more games, these releases spawned the &quot;SWAT&quot; series and the series moved into different video game genres.
* &quot;SWAT 3: Close Quarters Battle&quot; (2000) PC/Windows—tactical shooter
* &quot;SWAT: Urban Justice&quot; (2002—cancelled) PC/Windows
* &quot;SWAT 4&quot; (2005) PC/Windows—tactical shooter

&quot;SWAT 3: Close Quarters Battle&quot; and &quot;SWAT 4&quot; are both tactical shooters, the only games of that type in the series. &quot;SWAT 4&quot; is the final game in the full eight-game series, though by this point it had nothing to do with the original games, with the exception of a cameo by Marie Bonds in &quot;SWAT 3: Close Quarters Battle&quot; and Sonny Bonds as a SWAT unit lieutenant in &quot;SWAT 4&quot;.

At this point neither Jim Walls or Daryl Gates were developers in the series, though Gates was a consultant on &quot;SWAT 3: Close Quarters Battle&quot; along with the Advisor Kenneth A. Thatcher of LAPD.

The first SWAT game—technically &quot;Police Quest 5: SWAT&quot;—was later re-released as part of the &quot;Police Quest Collection Series&quot; (the second &quot;Police Quest&quot; adventure compilation), and all six PQ games were released as part of the &quot;SWAT Career Pack&quot;, the third &quot;complete series&quot; &quot;Police Quest&quot; collection. The first two were released in a double pack called Police Quest: SWAT Force and more recently in the &quot;Police Quest: SWAT 1+2&quot; pack on GoG.com. In the past, the first three SWAT games were released in a compilation entitled &quot;Police Quest: SWAT Generation&quot;. &quot;SWAT 3&quot; is currently sold separately on GoG.com, separately from the &quot;Police Quest&quot; packs.

&quot;SWAT: Urban Justice&quot; was a cancelled PC title (2001/2002) originally meant to be the followup to SWAT 3. An easter egg for the cancelled game can be found in SWAT4.

=== Console and mobile &quot;SWAT&quot; titles ===
Other &quot;SWAT&quot; titles include:
* &quot;&quot; (PS2 and Xbox) (2003)
* &quot;SWAT Force&quot; (Mobile) (2006)
* &quot;&quot; (PSP) (2007)
* &quot;SWAT Elite Troops&quot; (Mobile) (2008)

== Attempts to continue the series ==
On July 16, 2013, Jim Walls announced &quot;Precinct&quot;, a Kickstarter proposal for a spiritual successor to the &quot;Police Quest&quot; franchise. Sierra veteran Robert Lindsley has been signed on as the game&#x27;s executive producer. The game was to be developed by newly established studio Jim Walls Reloaded, where Lindsley also served as the company&#x27;s president. The game aspired to follow the classic Sierra adventure game formula with a &quot;modern feel&quot;. It had a funding goal of $500,000, with a fundraising period stretching from July 16 to August 16. However, Walls cancelled the Kickstarter prematurely on August 6, with $85,756 raised and 1,870 backers.

Subsequently, Walls and Lindsley announced that they would instead launch an alternative fundraising campaign for &quot;Precinct&quot;, which they called &quot;new and unique&quot;. The new crowdfunding campaign would not have the same time restrictions as Kickstarter, and the game would be launched once the funding from its backers was secured. But this campaign was also unsuccessful, shutting down two weeks later. As Lindsley explained: &quot;We simply don&#x27;t have the momentum needed to meet the requirements of this project&quot;. Nevertheless, Walls and Lindsley still remain hopeful to realize &quot;Precinct&quot; sometime in the future.

In August 2014, Activision reactivated the Sierra Entertainment label, opening up a future for the franchise as Sierra holds the IP for any future installments of the series.

== Collections and re-releases ==
Sierra&#x27;s first re-release of the games in a collection was in 1995 as &quot;Daryl F. Gates&#x27; Police Quest Collection: The Four Most Wanted&quot;. The package was released under the &quot;Daryl F. Gates&#x27; Police Quest&quot; series title, to cash in on the then newly released &quot;Daryl F. Gates&#x27; Police Quest: SWAT&quot;. Extras included behind the scenes history with the game creators, an abridged copy of the L.A. department police manual, and a video interview with Daryl F. Gates.

The second re-release collection was released in 1997 as &quot;Police Quest Collection Series&quot;. It contained &quot;Police Quest 1–3&quot;, &quot;Open Season&quot;, and &quot;SWAT&quot;. It also included the Daryl Gates interview and the documentation from the previous collection.

The two &quot;Police Quest: SWAT&quot; games were re-released in 1999 in a collection called &quot;Police Quest: SWAT Force&quot;.

The third re-release collection was released in 2000, as the &quot;SWAT Career Pack&quot; which included all six &quot;Police Quests&quot;: 1–3, &quot;Open Season&quot;, &quot;SWAT&quot;, and &quot;SWAT 2&quot;. It also included a demo for &quot;SWAT 3: Close Quarters Battle&quot;.

In 2003, the first three &quot;SWAT&quot; games were released in the &quot;Police Quest: SWAT Generation&quot; compilation.

In September 2006, Vivendi Games released &quot;Police Quest Collection: Step Behind the Badge&quot;, including the first four &quot;Police Quest&quot; games, minus the original AGI version of &quot;PQ1&quot;. The package included the DOSBox emulator for compatibility with Windows XP.

Since January 18, 2011, the &quot;Police Quest 1–4&quot; and &quot;Police Quest: SWAT 1 &amp; 2&quot; packs are internationally available at GOG.com in the form of digital downloads. The 2.0 installer for the &quot;Police Quest 1–4&quot; pack added in the original EGA version of &quot;PQ1&quot;. In 2017, &quot;SWAT 3&quot; and &quot;SWAT 4&quot; were both added to GOG. A community-driven online backend is available for &quot;SWAT 4&quot;″s multiplayer after the shut down of Gamespy.

<doc id="233210" wikidata="Q226951" url="?curid=233210" title="Thysanura">
<text>Thysanura is the now deprecated name of what was, for over a century, recognised as an order in the class Insecta. The two constituent groups within the former order, the Archaeognatha (jumping bristletails) and the Zygentoma (silverfish and firebrats), share several characteristics, such as of having three long caudal filaments, the lateral ones being the cerci, while the one between (telson) is a medial cerciform appendage, specifically an epiproct. They are also both wingless, and have bodies covered with fine scales, rather like the scales of the practically unrelated Lepidoptera. In the late 20th century, it was recognized that the two suborders were not sister taxa, therefore Thysanura was paraphyletic, and the two suborders were each raised to the status of an independent monophyletic order, with Archaeognatha sister taxon to the Dicondylia, including the Zygentoma.
Although the group Thysanura is no longer recognized, the name still appears in some published material. Another name used to separate the two groups from winged insects is Apterygota.

==Etymology==
The name Thysanura, first applied to the group by Pierre André Latreille, was derived from the Greek θυσάνος, &quot;thysanos&quot; for &quot;fringe&quot;, &quot;tassel&quot;, &quot;bristle&quot; and οὐρά, &quot;oura&quot; for &quot;tail&quot;, a reference to the three fanned out caudal filaments. This etymology is consistent with the English word &quot;bristletail&quot;, which is the common name for several hexapod species, not all of which fell within Thysanura.

<text>Ernst Florens Friedrich Chladni (, , ; 30 November 1756 – 3 April 1827) was a German physicist and musician. His most important work, for which he is sometimes labeled the father of acoustics, included research on vibrating plates and the calculation of the speed of sound for different gases. He also undertook pioneering work in the study of meteorites and is regarded by some as the father of meteoritics.

== Early life ==
Although Chladni was born in Wittenberg in Saxony, his family originated from Kremnica, then part of the Kingdom of Hungary and today a mining town in central Slovakia. Chladni has therefore been identified as German, Hungarian and Slovak.

Chladni came from an educated family of academics and learned men. Chladni&#x27;s great-grandfather, the Lutheran clergyman Georg Chladni (1637–1692), had left Kremnica in 1673 during the Counter Reformation. Chladni&#x27;s grandfather, Martin Chladni (1669–1725), was also a Lutheran theologian and, in 1710, became professor of theology at the University of Wittenberg. He was dean of the theology faculty in 1720–1721 and later became the university&#x27;s rector. Chladni&#x27;s uncle, Justus Georg Chladni (1701–1765), was a law professor at the university.
Another uncle, Johann Martin Chladni (1710–1759), was a theologian, a historian and a professor at the University of Erlangen and the University of Leipzig.

Chladni&#x27;s father, Ernst Martin Chladni (1715–1782), was a law professor and rector of the University of Wittenberg. He had joined the law faculty there in 1746. Chladni&#x27;s mother was Johanna Sophia and he was an only child. His father disapproved of his son&#x27;s interest in science and insisted that Chladni would become a lawyer.

== Career ==

Chladni studied law and philosophy in Wittenberg and Leipzig, obtaining a law degree from the University of Leipzig in 1782. That same year, his father died and he turned to physics in earnest. He gave lectures on law, mathematics, and natural sciences at the University of Wittenberg from 1783 to 1792. During this time, he began his first experiments with acoustics.

== Chladni figures ==


One of Chladni&#x27;s best-known achievements was inventing a technique to show the various modes of vibration on a rigid surface, known as Chladni figures or Chladni patterns due to the various shapes or patterns created by various modes. When resonating, a plate or membrane is divided into regions that vibrate in opposite directions, bounded by lines where no vibration occurs (nodal lines). Chladni repeated the pioneering experiments of Robert Hooke who, on 8 July, 1680, had observed the nodal patterns associated with the vibrations of glass plates. Hooke ran a violin bow along the edge of a plate covered with flour and saw the nodal patterns emerge.

Chladni&#x27;s technique, first published in 1787 in his book &quot;Entdeckungen über die Theorie des Klanges&quot; (&quot;Discoveries in the Theory of Sound&quot;), consisted of drawing a bow over a piece of metal whose surface was lightly covered with sand. The plate was bowed until it reached resonance, when the vibration causes the sand to move and concentrate along the nodal lines where the surface is still, outlining the nodal lines. The patterns formed by these lines are what are now called &quot;Chladni figures&quot;. Similar nodal patterns can also be found by assembling microscale materials on Faraday waves.

Chladni had visited the Paris Academy in 1808 and had demonstrated the vibration patterns before an audience that included not only the leading French scientists but Napoleon himself; Napoleon set a prize for the best mathematical explanation. Sophie Germain&#x27;s answer, although rejected due to flaws, was the only entry with the correct approach.

Variations of this technique are still commonly used in the design and construction of acoustic instruments such as violins, guitars, and cellos. Since the 20th century, it has become more common to place a loudspeaker driven by an electronic signal generator over or under the plate to achieve a more accurate adjustable frequency.

In quantum mechanics, Chladni figures (&quot;nodal patterns&quot;) are known to be related to the solutions of the Schrödinger equation for one-electron atoms, and the mathematics describing them was used by Erwin Schrödinger to arrive at the understanding of electron orbitals.

== Musical instruments ==

Since at least 1738, a musical instrument called a &quot;Glasspiel&quot; or &quot;verrillon&quot;, created by filling beer glasses with varying amounts of water, was popular in Europe. The beer glasses were struck by wooden mallets shaped like spoons to produce &quot;church and other solemn music&quot;. Benjamin Franklin was sufficiently impressed by a verrillon performance on a visit to London in 1757 that he created his own instrument, the glass armonica, in 1762.
Franklin&#x27;s armonica inspired several other instruments, including two created by Chladni. In 1791, Chladni invented the musical instrument called the &quot;euphon&quot; (not to be confused with the brass instrument euphonium), consisting of glass rods of different pitches. Chladni&#x27;s euphon is the direct ancestor of the modern day musical instrument known as the &quot;Cristal Baschet&quot;. Chladni also improved on Hooke&#x27;s &quot;musical cylinder&quot; to produce another instrument, the clavicylinder, in 1799.

Chladni travelled throughout Europe with his instruments giving demonstrations.

== Contributions to meteoritics ==

Chladni became interested in meteoritics following a conversation he had with Georg Christoph Lichtenberg about a fireball that Lichtenberg supposedly saw in the Gӧttingen sky in November 1791. Inspired by this report, Chladni researched reports of similar phenomena as well as reports of other falling masses across Europe and North America within the last century. Based on the uniformity among these sightings, he concluded that the phenomena of fireballs and falling masses must be genuine.

This led him to publish &quot;Über den Ursprung der von Pallas gefundenen und anderer ihr ähnlicher Eisenmassen und über einige damit in Verbindung stehende Naturerscheinungen&quot; (&quot;On the Origin of the Iron Masses Found by Pallas and Others Similar to it, and on Some Associated Natural Phenomena&quot;) in 1794. In this book he proposed that meteorites have an extraterrestrial origin. He argued that this would explain the high speeds of the falling masses as well as linking the masses to the fireballs; they glow intensely bright as they enter the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. He hypothesized that these meteorites were chunks of material that had either never been consolidated in the formation of larger masses or were debris from the formation and destruction of planets. This was a controversial statement at the time, since meteorites were thought to be of volcanic origin. Additionally, his claims challenged the established belief that nothing existed beyond the Moon except for other stars and planets. Indeed, this supposed emptiness of space had fascinated Chladni as a child when he learned about the relatively large distance between Mars and Jupiter, where the Asteroid Belt is now known to exist. This observation factored into his account for the origins of meteorites.

Chladni&#x27;s book was initially ridiculed by contemporary physicists, including Lichtenberg. Still, his writings sparked a curiosity that eventually led to more researchers supporting his theory. In 1795, a large stony meteorite was observed during its fall to Earth at a cottage near Wold Newton in Yorkshire, England and a piece of it, known as the Wold Cottage meteorite, was given to the British chemist Edward Howard who, along with French mineralogist Jacques de Bournon, carefully analyzed its composition and concluded that an extraterrestrial origin was likely, noting that the sample bore a strong resemblance to a sample of a meteorite from an early meteor shower in Siena, Italy. Although that event had been attributed to an eruption of Mount Vesuvius a few hundred kilometers away, no similar volcanoes exists within the same range of Wold Newton, with the closest being Hekla in Iceland. In 1803, the physicist and astronomer Jean Baptiste Biot was commissioned by the French Minister of the Interior to investigate a meteor shower over L&#x27;Aigle in northern France that had peppered the town with thousands of meteorite fragments. Unlike Chladni&#x27;s book and the scientific publication by Howard and de Bournon, Biot&#x27;s lively report became popular and persuaded more people to take Chladni&#x27;s insights seriously.

Chladni&#x27;s insights have led some in the field to call him the &quot;father of meteoritics&quot; while others have been more conservative with their appraisal of Chladni&#x27;s contributions to the field.

Chladni continued to develop his record of meteorite sightings throughout the next several decades as well as amassing a collection of meteorite samples. He donated this collection to the Mineralogical Museum of Berlin University in 1827 and it now resides in the Museum of Natural History at Humboldt University of Berlin.

A mineral, first described in 1993 from the Carlton (IIICD) iron meteorite, was named in his honor.

== Other work ==

Chladni discovered Chladni&#x27;s law, a simple algebraic relation for approximating the modal frequencies of the free oscillations of plates and other bodies.

Chladni estimated sound velocities in different gases by placing those gases in an organ pipe and measuring the characteristics of the sounds that emerged when the pipe was played. This built on work on measuring the speed of sound in air that Pierre Gassendi began in 1635.

== Death ==

Chladni died on 3 April 1827, in Breslau, Lower Silesia, then part of the Kingdom of Prussia and today the city of Wrocław in southwestern Poland.

<text>Charles Victor de Bonstetten (; 3 September 17453 February 1832) was a Swiss liberal writer.

==Life==
Charles Victor was born at Bern in Switzerland to one of its great patrician families on 3 September 1745. He began his education there before traveling at age 14 to Yverdon. He studied at Geneva from 1763 to 1766 at Geneva, where he came under the influence of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Charles Bonnet and imbibed liberal sentiments. His father, intending to fit him for a career as a Bernese senator of the traditional type, was alarmed at the tone of his letters from Geneva and recalled his son to Bern. He obeyed but his distaste for Bernese life led him to attempt suicide by pistol. Supposedly, he was distracted by a moonbeam at the moment of discharge and survived to be sent by his father to Leiden to continue his studies.

As the climate of Leiden disagreed with him, he was permitted to travel to England in 1769, where he made many friends including the poet Thomas Gray. He returned home via Paris where he was introduced to its literary society. At home, he nursed his father during the illness which killed him in 1770. Following his father&#x27;s death, he immediately traveled to Italy, where he reached as far south as Naples. No longer a revolutionary but still a liberal, he returned to Bern in 1774 and entered its political life.

He began his political career as a member of the avoyer&#x27;s council and acted as the patron of the historian Johannes von Müller. He was soon appointed as bailiff over Gessenay, possibly leaving it in 1779 for Saanen. ambiguity He published his &quot;Pastoral Letters&quot; (&quot;&quot;) in German in 1781. In 1787, he was transferred to Nyon near the French border. He enjoyed the location but was distrusted both by his former liberal friends and his conservative peers. He was obliged to retire after taking part in a celebration of the storming of the Bastille in 1791 and—probably simply owing to his lack of military training—misdirecting the guards under his command when the area was threatened by the army of the Convention the next year. From 1795 to 1797, he served as bailiff of the Italian-speaking districts of Lugano, Locarno, Mendrisio, and Val Maggia in the Ticino valley. He is credited with introducing the region to the potato.

The French invasion of Switzerland and establishment of the Helvetic Republic in 1798 drove Bonstetten once more into private life. At the invitation of Madame Brun, he resided in Copenhagen, Denmark, until 1801. He then traveled to Italy before settling in Geneva for the remainder of his life. He resided there uneventfully but in the society of many distinguished people, including Madame de Staël. His most celebrated book—&quot;Men of the South and of the North&quot; (&quot;)—was published during this era, arguing that climate was responsible for the superiority of northern Europe over the south, but his own writing generally fell into low esteem. Instead, he is principally remembered for his social character—as a conversationalist, and as the friend, often the intimate companion of many of the more celebrated leaders of thought and action during his long life.

<text>USS &quot;Ogden&quot; (LPD-5), an , was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for Ogden, Utah. &quot;Ogden&quot; was laid down on 4 February 1963 by the New York Naval Shipyard. She was launched on 27 June 1964 sponsored by Mrs. Laurence J. Burton, and commissioned at New York City on 19 June 1965.

==Operational history==
===Vietnam era===

After training off Norfolk, Virginia, &quot;Ogden &quot;arrived at San Diego, California, on 29 October 1965 to join the United States Pacific Fleet and complete her initial training. In her first year of service the ship deployed twice to South Vietnam (8 February through 4 April 1966 and 16 May through 7 July 1966), bringing Marines and their equipment to the Vietnam War. On her return passages, she brought damaged vehicles home for repair. During the summer of 1966, she conducted experiments with aircraft capable of vertical or short landing and take-off. &quot;Ogden&quot; participated in Operation End Sweep in Haiphong Harbor as a member of Task Force 78 from January 1973 through July 1973, clearing mines with RH-53A helicopters.

In the summer of 1977, &quot;Ogden&quot; stood off Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base and acted as the base vessel for the U.S. Army&#x27;s 2nd Battalion 39th Infantry Regiment of the 1st Brigade of the 9th Infantry Division as it was undergoing amphibious warfare training. After this was completed &quot;Ogden&quot; embarked this unit and transported it back to Fort Lewis, Washington.

==== 1989 &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; oil spill Oil Spill Task Force 2 ====
As a part of the Oil Spill Task Force 2 created after the 1989 &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; oil spill, &quot;Ogden&quot; supported over 400 civilians with beds, food, operational command for the task force helicopters. She was relieved by after spending two months on-site.

===Western Pacific===

&quot;Ogden&quot; had turned sailors and Marines into Golden Shellbacks on at least five occasions. On 10 November 1976, 24 June 1985, 1988, 1992, and again in November 1999, &quot;Ogden&quot; crossed the Equator and the International Dateline simultaneously. During the 2001 crossing, &quot;Ogden&quot; hosted Alpha Company 1st Battalion, 4th Marines of the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit.

&quot;Ogden&quot; was damaged when she collided with the submarine on 27 February 2002, which opened a hole in one of her fuel tanks.

===Middle East===

She was commissioned as part of the United States Third Fleet. She deployed in early 2006 with the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit as part of a battle group. They were the first amphibious fleet to be sent to the Persian Gulf during Operation Desert Shield. During this time she was mostly used for intercepting blockade running freighters and tankers.

During Operation Desert Storm, &quot;Ogden&quot; was part of the task force sent to capture Failaka Island. The island was captured with very little resistance and &quot;Ogden&quot; transferred the prisoners to Saudi Arabia, making the largest transfer of prisoners on a ship ever.

The ship was originally scheduled for decommissioning in 2000, but with the requirements of the Operation Iraqi Freedom it was rescheduled.

On 16 February 2007, &quot;Ogden&quot; was awarded the 2006 Battle &quot;E&quot; award.

After a ceremony held aboard the ship in port at Naval Base San Diego, &quot;Ogden&quot; was decommissioned from the United States Navy on 21 February 2007.

==Fate==
On 10 July 2014 during the naval exercise RIMPAC 2014, she was used as a missile target and sank northwest of Hawaii after being hit by a Naval Strike Missile launched by the Royal Norwegian Navy frigate .

<text>Newport is a market town and civil parish in the borough of Telford and Wrekin in Shropshire, England. It lies north-east of Telford, west of Stafford, and is near the Shropshire-Staffordshire border. The 2001 census recorded 10,814 people living in the town&#x27;s parish, which rose to 11,387 by the 2011 census.

== Toponym ==
The Normans planned a new town called Novus Burgus roughly on the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Plesc. The first market charter was granted by Henry I, and over time the name changed from Novus Burgus, to Nova Porta, to Newborough and finally to Newport in about 1220.
==Location==
The site was chosen partly because of its location near the Via Devana (Roman Road, which ran from Colchester to Chester), and partly because of the number of fisheries (which are mentioned in the Domesday Survey). The River Meese, which flows from Aqualate Mere, lies to the north of the town.

Newport sits on a sandstone ridge on the eastern border of the Welsh Marches and west of the Aqualate Mere, the largest natural lake in the English Midlands. The area around it at the end of the last ice age was part of Lake Lapworth. Formed from melting glaciers, it covered a vast area of north Shropshire. There is evidence of pre-historic fishing in the area as two ancient log boats were uncovered from Newport. One has been preserved and is kept at Harper Adams University at nearby Edgmond.

The villages of Church Aston, Chetwynd and Longford are adjoined to the south of Newport, though they remain in separate parishes. The village of Edgmond is located just to the west, separated by Cheney Hill, Chetwynd Park and the currently truncated Shrewsbury and Newport Canal.

Like many rural market towns, Newport was influenced by industry; it served the needs of the mining area to the east of Shropshire and was also affected by mass-produced industrial goods that replaced traditional crafts.
Newport&#x27;s inland location can lead to very cold winters. It holds the record for the lowest temperature recorded in England, on 11 January 1982. This was cold enough to freeze diesel fuel in vehicles.

==History==

Newport was located in the historic kingdom of Mercia, near where Wreocensæte was once situated. Humans inhabited the surrounding area long before the creation of the town. Once established, Newport became a market town in the centre of the rural farming area between Stafford and Shrewsbury.

===Saxon period===
In Saxon times, there were two settlements in the area. The first, &quot;Eastun&quot;, has been identified as Church Aston, and the second was &quot;Plaesc&quot; which is now Newport. In AD 963, Plaesc was described as having a High Street, a stone quarry, and a religious community. The name Plaesc means a shallow pool. Few signs of the Saxon settlement exist today, apart from the High Street, the Quarry, which could be either the Quarry on Stafford Road, or the Hole Meadow on Wellington Road. This has not been definitely confirmed.

===Norman to Tudor period===
At the time of the Norman Conquest, the land where Newport sits formed part of the manor of Edgmond, which William I gave as a gift along with the county of Shropshire to Roger, Earl of Shrewsbury. Henry I founded the borough, first called Newborough, after the manor came into his hands from Robert de Belesme.

Newport was omitted from the Domesday Book of 1086, but this is not uncommon. Other towns omitted include London, Tamworth and Ludlow, all boroughs since Saxon times.

The Normans planned the new town around the older one during the reign of Henry I. The wide main street was designed for its market, and the narrow burgage plots running at right angles to it are typical of Norman architecture and planning, though today only Newport Guildhall and Smallwood Lodge are clear signs of Tudor buildings, due to the 1665 fire which destroyed most of the High Street.

Medieval Newport flourished with trade in leather, wool and fish. Novoportans possessed the right to provide fish for the Royal table. The many half-timbered buildings surviving from the late medieval and Tudor periods confirm Newport&#x27;s success, leading to the first market charter which was granted by Henry I.

The town is mentioned once by John Leland in a list of castles, though now no visible remains of the castle exist; however, the most probable location for it would have been the traditional site of a manor house at Upper Bar, where there is a fragment of a square, broad moat, or on the higher ground along the Forton road, where the Castle House school stands. As regards the moat, nearly square, forming by measurement an area of 60 square yards, two sides have been filled with rubbish. Nothing is known about the occupants of the moated site. It could have pre-dated the town or, perhaps more likely, could have been the manor house of the Audleys, who were granted the manor in 1227. By 1421, the manor house was in ruins.

One of the main reasons for Newport&#x27;s early wealth was the surrounding fisheries and the chief service of the burgesses, being that of taking fish to the Royal court wherever it might be. This custom was continued after Henry III had granted the borough, with the manor of Edgmond, to Henry de Audley; Henry&#x27;s son James granted in the middle of the 13th century that the burgesses need not take the fish anywhere except within the county of Shropshire.

The burgesses received certain privileges from Henry I; Henry II, in an undated charter, granted them all the liberties, rights and customs that they had enjoyed in the time of Henry I, including a guild merchant, which is mentioned in the &quot;quo warranto&quot; rolls as one of the privileges claimed by the burgesses. Confirmation charters were granted by Edward I in 1287 and Edward II in 1311, while the town was incorporated in 1551 by Edward VI, whose charter was confirmed by James I in 1604. The governing body consisted of a Lord High Steward, deputy steward, two water-bailiffs and 28 burgesses, but the corporation was abolished by the Municipal Corporation Act of 1883, and a Local Board was formed, which, under the Local Government Act 1894, gave place to an urban district council.

===Stuart to Regency period===
In 1665, many buildings were damaged in the Great Fire of Newport, and only a few of the medieval structures remain. However, there remain many fine Regency and Georgian frontages built on the site of the former Norman plots. This allows the main streets of Newport to be wider and less cluttered than those of the other towns of its age.
===Local landed estates===

By the 19th century, Newport was surrounded by large estates that came right to the verge of the town, determining size and development. The vivary and open fields at Norbroom had gone making the town dependent on its rural hinterland. The few fields that remained were for hay or cattle, forming a small green belt. These estates exerted a powerful influence on the town, something obvious in the deference shown and respect paid to these landed families until at least the First World War.

Beginning in the southwest of the town was the largest estate, the Lilleshall estate of the Duke of Sutherland. This dates from the dissolution of the monasteries, the lands of Lilleshall Abbey being purchased in 1539 by James Leveson of Wolverhampton.

The next estate was that in the south-east of Woodcote Hall, a smaller one belonging to the Cotes family.

On the west between Lilleshall and the town was the Longford Estate of the Talbots, Earls of Shrewsbury, sold in 1789 to Ralph Leake of Wellington who had made his fortune in the East India Company.

North of the town is the Chetwynd Park estate of the Pigotts, bought in 1803 by Thomas Borrow of north Derbyshire who changed his surname to Burton Borough.

The Aqualate Estate to the east lies mostly in Staffordshire.

===20th century===
The town was fortunate to avoid civilian casualties during the Second World War when on Christmas Eve 1944, a V-1 flying bomb launched from a Heinkel bomber and aimed at Manchester landed in a field east of Newport, about 300 yards from the Newport to Gnosall road. This bomb is now on display at Royal Air Force Museum Cosford.

The passenger service on the railway line between Stafford and Wellington was withdrawn in 1964 as a result of the Beeching Axe, and the line closed completely in 1967. The track was lifted in 1969, and the Newport end was subsequently redeveloped for housing.

In the 1960s to early 1970s, when the population of Newport was nearer 3000, over a third of the local workforce was employed at Serck Audco Valves, Greenwood Moore, Kwiz Feather Flights etc. All of this industry and large-scale employment has since gone - mostly during the late 1970s and early 1980s.

On 23 November 1981, an F1/T2 tornado which formed over the nearby civil parish of Chetwynd later moved over Newport, causing some damage in the town.

At Harper Adams University College just outside Newport in Edgmond, on 11 January 1982 the English lowest temperature weather record was broken (and is kept to this day): .

===Modern-day Newport===
Newport is now predominantly a commuter town, with people travelling to Telford, Shrewsbury, Stafford, Wolverhampton and beyond for employment.

Previously, very little redevelopment happened in Newport from the 1960s—attention going instead to nearby towns including Wellington and Oakengates, which make up the new town of Telford—until the Telford and Wrekin Council borough towns incentive was brought about in 2007. The town received major investments over the following years, including a major redevelopment of the canal and surrounding area, the lower bar of the High Street area, planned housing, bars and restaurants set to line the canal. New sporting facilities, including a climbing wall in the Springfield area of the town, were provided.

In the spring of 2010, the first stage of the town&#x27;s £1.5million regeneration began, with the £250,000 and £300,000 redevelopment of Victoria Park behind the now-defunct The Royal Victoria Hotel. The next stage of the regeneration, which was mainly focused on the High Street area of the town and Central square, involved re-surfacing the High-Street pavements and changing the design of the High Street around the Puleston Cross, removing the cobblestones and replacing them with paving and the traced outline of the ancient market hall.

In July 2011, Telford and Wrekin Council unveiled plans for green land off the A518 bypass. The proposals included hundreds of new homes, a new supermarket, a business park and improvements to Burton Borough School.

House prices in the town are the highest in the TF postcode area (including the towns of Telford and Market Drayton) and among the highest in the county.

The town is currently attempting to acquire Transition Towns and Fairtrade Town statuses.

==Facilities and places of interest==

===The High Street===
The main street in Newport follows the Norman design. This resulted in the distinctive long wide High Street, split into three parts, upper bar, lower bar and St Mary&#x27;s street, with the centre of the high street being the 19th-century Town Hall and Market Hall completed in March 1860.

Burgage plots ran along either side, and the church rising up in the middle, with the High Street with St Mary&#x27;s Street splitting off and re-joining the high street around the island on which are sited the St Nicholas Church and the Puleston Cross (an ancient memorial cross usually known locally but inaccurately as the Butter Cross).
After the fire of Newport in 1665 the old Norman buildings were replaced with grander Georgian architecture, which hid the work yards behind. The Georgian shops remain, but the work yards have now been developed into housing and the Boughey Gardens tennis courts, next to the literary institute.Newport has retained shops on High Street, Stafford Street and St Mary&#x27;s Street, with St Mary&#x27;s Street having cobblestones and the majority of shops being small boutiques. St Mary&#x27;s is also the site of various markets and fairs which tie in with Newport&#x27;s indoor market.

The town also has businesses such as Costa Coffee, Boots, Card Factory, Subway, Greggs, Coral, Bet365, the town&#x27;s former Woolworths store was developed into a B&amp;M Bargains.

On the Newport by-pass near to the Aqualate Mere the A518 road there is a small out-of-town industrial estate known as Mere Park, featuring a garden centre, hotel and restaurant. There are also various other small-scale industrial estates that lie around the Newport by-pass and Springfield estate.

===Other areas===
The oldest man-made landmark in the town is the Puleston Cross which is a butter cross positioned near the Church of St Nicholas. This is a 13th-century cross denoting a marketplace. The cross was set up in memory of Sir Roger de Pyvelesdon (i.e. &#x27;de Puleston&#x27;) who died in 1272, in Shropshire. This is confirmed in a deed signed by his son Sir Roger de Puleston in 1285, which refers to &quot;the cross set up for the soul of Roger de Pyvelesdon who died in 1272&quot;.

Towards the top end of the town is the Combat Stress centre, built in 1908 as the for the Newport Workhouse; it was subsequently developed as accommodation for elderly ladies until its closure in 1995. The home was purchased in 1996 and refurbished.

The town sits near the Aqualate Mere, which is the largest natural lake in the English Midlands.


===Religious sites===
The first recorded religious community was documented in Saxon script from 963 AD. This was the church of St Mary Magdalene, built in the time of Archbishop Dunstan.

Newport lies in the Church of England Diocese of Lichfield and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Shrewsbury and as a Norman-planned new town, religion played a strong part in the design of the town, with the centre of the town being dominated by St Nicholas Church, originally built in the reign of Henry I and restored in 1886 and 1890.

The second church in the town is the St Peter and Paul Catholic church in Newport Salters Lane, built 1857 and the oldest Catholic church in Shropshire, designed by Augustus Pugin.

The ruins of Lilleshall Abbey are from the town centre. They include a Norman west door and part of the front, considerable remains of the church besides, and traces of domestic buildings. The abbey was founded in 1145, under charter from King Stephen, by Richard de Baumes or Belmeis, dean of St Alkmund, Shrewsbury, for Augustinian canons, who were brought from Dorchester Abbey, Oxfordshire.

A smaller church for the Baptist community sits at the back of The Royal Victoria Hotel in water lane, called Newport Baptist church, which was built in the 1960s.

The town has had a wide range of religious sites over time and this is shown in the number of churches in the town, the Independent Chapel, Beaumaris Lane, Newport, built 1803 on the site of a church dating from 1765, converted into cottages in 1832 when they finished work on the new church, the Newport Independent (Congregational) Chapel, Wellington Road, built in 1831, subsequently becoming part of the United Reformed Church. It merged with the Methodist Chapel in Avenue Road in 2001 to become Trinity Church, a joint Methodist/United Reformed Church. A major renovation was undertaken in 2010.

Due to the growth and decline of religions over time some previous churches have since been used for other uses or been demolished altogether, most of these are in the Upper Bar area of the town, around the Granville road and Wellington road area.

Near to the Trinity church is the Newport Primitive Methodist Chapel, built 1877, closed 1920 which replaced the one built in Stafford Road, built 1830. This is still there as a house next door to the New Inn.

Two more former churches are the Newport Wesleyan Methodist Chapel, Upper Bar, built 1829, which was turned into a shop and theatre in 1876 and the Wesleyan Methodist Chapel in Avenue Road which was built in 1876 and closed in 2001 on merging with the Wellington Road URC Chapel; it subsequently became a gym but has since been converted into a house.
Newport General Cemetery was opened for burials on 2 March 1859 with its first interment taking place on 5 March 1859 when it is noted that some 1,000 people witnessed the burial. The cemetery contains a chapel built at the same time and is bounded at the public roadside by fine wrought iron railings and gates. The cemetery was originally laid out with four oval lawns around a cross-shaped set of roads with the chapel centrally placed. The cemetery contains the war graves of eleven British Army soldiers of World War I and a soldier and airman of World War II, who are commemorated by a row of Commonwealth War Graves Commission headstones. Also buried there is former first-class cricketer Tom Collins who was headmaster at Newport Grammar School.

Newport is the main hub for the farming community along the Shropshire/Staffordshire border and as a local business centre. The Football Association, Medical and Exercise Science Department is based at Lilleshall Hall on the outskirts of the town.

A large section of Newport&#x27;s economy is based around education, two selective state schools and a large comprehensive drawing students from far beyond the town, as well as a university on the edge of the town along with a regional food academy.

Retail plays a major part of the economy of the town, with the majority of shops being located in and around the High Street, with larger out-of-town stores located on the Audley Avenue and Springfield trading estates in the south of the town and to the east of the town the Mere Park complex.

===In the media===
Christmas Guisers&#x27; Play from Newport, Shropshire [1883] is about the town. Newport was the first town in Shropshire to be on &quot;Dickinson&#x27;s Real Deal&quot;. A television documentary called &quot;The Spy Who Stole My Life&quot; showed the town as the backdrop of the Robert Hendy-Freegard story, who conned students from the town was shown by Channel Five on 7 September 2005. In Australia, this was called &quot;The spy Who Conned Me&quot;.

==Education==

Newport has a full range of educational establishments, from primary schools to a university. The selective schools in the town are Newport Girls&#x27; High School and Haberdashers&#x27; Adams (previously known as Adams&#x27; Grammar School). Harper Adams University is located in the nearby village of Edgmond, and Keele University operates teaching rooms in the doctor&#x27;s surgery for trainee student doctors. For Further Education students, the closest colleges to the town are Telford College of Arts and Technology and Stafford College, with buses running from the town to both colleges and to Shrewsbury College of Arts &amp; Technology. Just outside the town is Edgmond Hall, used by Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council for outdoor activities for school students.

==Transport==
The town has been a well-used crossing point even before the creation of the settlement and sits on a historical crossing of the Via Devana.

The town became prominent as a coaching town on the Mail coach route between London, North Wales and Ireland as well being on a historic junction on the road from London to Chester and the East Midlands. This meant that the town grew around the different roads that cross the town. At the centre of the town is a large island with the church of St. Nicholas at one end and Central Square nightclub at the other, the High Street on one side and St Mary&#x27;s Street on the other side. The two streets come together at one end in front of the nightclub at the junction with the A518 from Stafford which runs through the town on an east–west route from Stafford to Telford. They come together at the other end by the truncated Shrewsbury and Newport Canal beyond which is the junction with the A519 road from Eccleshall and Stoke-on-Trent. At the southern end of the High Street is another junction where the A519 road leaves on its way to Telford.

Before the road network, the canal was the main link to the town. It is not currently connected to the national network, but there are plans to restore it to a fully working canal by the Shrewsbury and Newport Canals Trust. linking into the national canal network at Norbury Junction to the east of the A41 which now borders the town to the east on a north–south by-pass route opened in early 1985 to ease the congestion on the High Street.

The town sits around from the M54, and from the M6 Motorways.

===Buses===

The town is served by buses between Stafford and Telford and a service from Shrewsbury. Arriva Midlands is the main service provider for the town with additional shoppers services operated by Wrekin Rider, the bus operating arm of Telford and Wrekin District Council.

===Rail===
The former Stafford to Shrewsbury Line once ran through the town, but due to cuts Newport (Salop) railway station was closed in September 1964 and has now been dismantled. The line has been restored to Hortonwood, and it is possible that the next phase could be to reconnect the town to the railway network. This has been given a boost by the town council, who are currently in talks with Stafford Borough Council to discuss the link to Stafford. The line is in the top 36 &#x27;Lines that should reopen&#x27; listing published by the Campaign for Better Transport, and with the Telford International Freight Park in Donnington, Telford needing better connections to the east coast and Scotland, this could mean a line going past the town and on towards Gnosall and Stafford.

===Cycling===
Newport is on National Route 55 and Regional Route 75 of the Sustrans National Cycle Network. Cycle maps for these routes are available from the Newport Visitor Information centre, located in the Pop Up Shop on Wellington Road. The cycleway to Stafford runs on the former railway line and will be completed by the end of 2014.

===Walking===
The town sits on the Way for the Millennium walkway which is long, and heads toward Stafford, passing through several villages on the way.

<text>The tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) is a species of ground shark, and the only extant member of the genus &quot;Galeocerdo&quot; and family Galeocerdonidae. It is a large apex predator, with females capable of attaining a length of over . Populations are found in many tropical and temperate waters, especially around central Pacific islands. Its name derives from the dark stripes down its body, which resemble a tiger&#x27;s pattern, but fade as the shark matures.

The tiger shark is a solitary, mostly nocturnal hunter. It is notable for having the widest food spectrum of all sharks, with a range of prey that includes crustaceans, fish, seals, birds, squid, turtles, sea snakes, dolphins, and others, even smaller sharks. It also has a reputation as a &quot;garbage eater&quot;, consuming a variety of inedible, man-made objects that linger in its stomach. Tiger sharks have only one recorded natural predator, the orca. It is considered a near-threatened species because of finning and fishing by humans.

The tiger shark is second only to the great white in recorded fatal attacks on humans, but these events are still exceedingly rare.

==Taxonomy==
The shark was first described by Peron and Lesueur in 1822, and was given the name &quot;Squalus cuvier&quot;. Müller and Henle in 1837 renamed it &quot;Galeocerdo tigrinus&quot;. The genus, &quot;Galeocerdo&quot;, is derived from the Greek &quot;galeos&quot;, which means shark, and &quot;kerdo&quot;, the word for fox. The species name honors naturalist Georges Cuvier. It is often colloquially called the man-eater shark.

The tiger shark is a member of the order Carcharhiniformes, the most species-rich order of sharks, with more than 270 species also including the small catsharks and hammerhead sharks. Members of this order are characterized by the presence of a nictitating membrane over the eyes, two dorsal fins, an anal fin, and five gill slits. It is the largest member of the order, commonly referred to as ground sharks. It is the only extant member of &quot;Galeocerdo&quot;, the only member of the family Galeocerdonidae. The oldest remains of &quot;Galeocerdo&quot; extend back to the Eocene epoch, while the oldest fossils of the modern tiger shark &quot;Galeocerdo cuvier&quot; date to the Middle Miocene, around 13.8 million years ago.

==Description==
The tiger shark commonly attains an adult length of and weighs between . The International Game Fish Association&#x27;s all-tackle record is . It is sexually dimorphic, with females being the larger sex. Mature females are often over while mature males rarely get that large. Exceptionally large females reportedly can measure over , and the largest males . Weights of particularly large female tiger sharks can exceed . One pregnant female caught off Australia reportedly measured long and weighed . Even larger unconfirmed catches have been claimed. Some papers have accepted a record of an exceptional , tiger shark, but since this is far larger than any scientifically observed specimen, verification would be needed. A 2019 study suggested that Pliocene tiger sharks could have reached in maximum length. There is variation in the speed of growth rates of juvenile tiger sharks depending on the region they inhabit, with some growing close to twice as fast as others.

Among the largest extant sharks, the tiger shark ranks in average size only behind the whale shark (&quot;Rhincodon typus&quot;), the basking shark (&quot;Cetorhinus maximus&quot;), and the great white shark (&quot;Carcharodon carcharias&quot;). This makes it the second-largest predatory shark, after the great white. Some other species such as megamouth sharks (&quot;Megachasma pelagios&quot;), Pacific sleeper sharks (&quot;Somniosus pacificus&quot;), Greenland sharks (&quot;Somniosus microcephalus&quot;), and bluntnose sixgill sharks (&quot;Hexanchus griseus&quot;) broadly overlap in size with the tiger shark, but as these species are comparatively poorly studied, whether their typical mature size matches that of the tiger shark is unclear. The great hammerhead (&quot;Sphyrna mokarran&quot;), a member of the same taxonomic order as the tiger shark, has a similar or even greater average body length, but is lighter and less bulky, with a maximum known weight coming from a heavily pregnant long individual at .

Tiger shark teeth are unique with very sharp, pronounced serrations and an unmistakable sideways-pointing tip. Such dentition has developed to slice through flesh, bone, and other tough substances, such as turtle shells. Like most sharks, its teeth are continually replaced by rows of new teeth throughout the shark&#x27;s life. Relative to the shark&#x27;s size, tiger shark teeth are considerably shorter than those of a great white shark, but they are nearly as broad as the root as the great white&#x27;s teeth and are arguably better suited to slicing through hard-surfaced prey.

A tiger shark generally has long fins to provide lift as the shark maneuvers through water, while the long upper tail provides bursts of speed. The tiger shark normally swims using small body movements.

===Skin===
The skin of a tiger shark can typically range from blue to light green with a white or light-yellow underbelly. The advantage of this is that when it is hunting for its prey, when prey looks at the shark from above, the shark will be camouflaged, since the water below is darker. When prey is below the shark and looks up the light underbelly will also camouflage the shark with the sunlight. This is known as countershading. Dark spots and stripes are most visible in young sharks and fade as the shark matures. Its head is somewhat wedge-shaped, which makes it easy to turn quickly to one side. They have small pits on the snout which hold electroreceptors called the ampullae of Lorenzini, which enable them to detect electric fields, including the weak electrical impulses generated by prey, which helps them to hunt. Tiger sharks also have a sensory organ called a lateral line which extends on their flanks down most of the length of their sides. The primary role of this structure is to detect minute vibrations in the water. These adaptations allow the tiger shark to hunt in darkness and detect hidden prey.

===Vision===
Sharks do not have moveable upper or lower eyelids, but the tiger shark—among other sharks—has a nictitating membrane, which is a clear eyelid that can cover the eye. A reflective layer behind the tiger shark&#x27;s retina, called the tapetum lucidum, allows light-sensing cells a second chance to capture photons of visible light. This enhances vision in low-light conditions.

==Distribution and habitat==
The tiger shark is often found close to the coast, mainly in tropical and subtropical waters throughout the world. Its behavior is primarily nomadic, but is guided by warmer currents, and it stays closer to the equator throughout the colder months. It tends to stay in deep waters that line reefs, but it does move into channels to pursue prey in shallower waters. In the western Pacific Ocean, the shark has been found as far north as Japan and as far south as New Zealand. It has also been recorded in the Mediterranean Sea, but rarely, off Malaga (Spain), Sicily (Italy) and Libya.

Tiger sharks can be seen in the Gulf of Mexico, North American beaches, and parts of South America. It is also commonly observed in the Caribbean Sea. Other locations where tiger sharks are seen include off Africa, China, India, Australia, and Indonesia. Certain tiger sharks have been recorded at depths just shy of .

==Feeding==
The tiger shark is an apex predator and has a reputation for eating almost anything. These predators swim close inland to eat at night, and during the day swim out into deeper waters. Young tiger sharks are found to feed largely on small fish, as well as various small jellyfish, and mollusks including cephalopods. Around the time they attain , or near sexual maturity, their selection expands considerably, and much larger animals become regular prey. Numerous fish, mollusks (including gastropods and cephalopods), crustaceans, sea birds, sea snakes, marine mammals (e.g. bottlenose dolphins (&quot;Tursiops&quot;), common dolphins (&quot;Delphinus&quot;), spotted dolphins (&quot;Stenella&quot;), dugongs (&quot;Dugong dugon&quot;), seals and sea lions), and sea turtles (including the three largest species: the leatherback (&quot;Dermochelys coriacea&quot;), the loggerhead (&quot;Caretta caretta&quot;) and the green sea turtles (&quot;Chelonia mydas&quot;)), are regularly eaten by adult tiger sharks. In fact, adult sea turtles have been found in up to 20.8% of studied tiger shark stomachs, indicating somewhat of a dietary preference for sea turtles where they are commonly encountered. They also eat other sharks (including adult sandbar sharks (&quot;Carcharhinus plumbeus&quot;)), as well as rays, and sometimes even other tiger sharks.

Due to high risk of predation, dolphins often avoid regions inhabited by tiger sharks. Injured or ailing whales may also be attacked and eaten. A group was documented killing an ailing humpback whale (&quot;Megaptera novaeangliae&quot;) in 2006 near Hawaii. A scavenger, the tiger shark will feed on dead whales, and has been documented doing so alongside great white sharks. Tiger sharks have also been observed to feed on dead manta rays in the German Channel of Palau.

Evidence of dugong predation was identified in one study that found dugong tissue in 15 of 85 tiger sharks caught off the Australian coast. Additionally, examination of adult dugongs has shown scars from failed shark attacks. To minimize attacks, dugong microhabitats shift similarly to those of known tiger shark prey when the sharks are abundant.

The broad, heavily calcified jaws and nearly terminal mouth, combined with robust, serrated teeth, enable the tiger shark to take on these large prey. In addition, excellent eyesight and acute sense of smell enable it to react to faint traces of blood and follow them to the source. The ability to pick up low-frequency pressure waves enables the shark to advance towards an animal with confidence, even in murky water. The shark circles its prey and studies it by prodding it with its snout. When attacking, the shark often eats its prey whole, although larger prey are often eaten in gradual large bites and finished over time.

Notably, terrestrial mammals, including horses (&quot;Equus ferus caballus&quot;), goats (&quot;Capra aegagrus hircus&quot;), sheep (&quot;Ovis aries&quot;), dogs (&quot;Canis lupus familiaris&quot;), cats (&quot;Felis catus&quot;), and brown rats (&quot;Rattus norvegicus&quot;), are fairly common in the stomach contents of tiger sharks around the coasts of Hawaii. In one case, remains of two flying foxes were found in the stomach of this shark, and in another, an echidna (&quot;Tachyglossus aculeatus&quot;) was regurgitated by a tiger shark being tagged off Orpheus Island, Queensland. Because of its aggressive and indiscriminate feeding style, it often mistakenly eats inedible objects, such as automobile license plates, oil cans, tires, and baseballs. Due to their habits of eating essentially anything, Tiger sharks are often referred to as the &quot;garbage can of the sea&quot;.

===Predation by orcas===
Tiger sharks are preyed on by orcas. Orcas have been recorded hunting and killing tiger sharks by holding them upside down to induce tonic immobility in order to drown the shark. The orcas bite off the shark&#x27;s fins before disemboweling and devouring it.

===Swimming efficiency and stealth===
All tiger sharks generally swim slowly, which, combined with cryptic coloration, may make them difficult for prey to detect in some habitats. They are especially well camouflaged against dark backgrounds. Despite their sluggish appearance, tiger sharks are one of the strongest swimmers of the carcharhinid sharks. Once the shark has come close, a speed burst allows it to reach the intended prey before it can escape.

==Reproduction==
Males reach sexual maturity at and females at . Typical weight of relatively young sexually mature specimens, which often locally comprise the majority of tiger sharks encountered per game-fishing and scientific studies, is around . Females mate once every three years. They breed by internal fertilization. The male inserts one of his claspers into the female&#x27;s genital opening (cloaca), acting as a guide for the sperm. The male uses his teeth to hold the female still during the procedure, often causing the female considerable discomfort. Mating in the Northern Hemisphere generally takes place between March and May, with birth between April and June the following year. In the Southern Hemisphere, mating takes place in November, December, or early January. The tiger shark is the only species in its family that is ovoviviparous; its eggs hatch internally and the young are born live when fully developed.
Tiger Sharks are unique among all sharks in the fact that they employ embrytrophy to nourish their young inside the womb. The young gestate in sacks which are filled with a fluid that nourishes them. This allows for the young to dramatically increase in size, even though they have no placental connection to the mother.

The young develop inside the mother&#x27;s body up to 16 months. Litters range from 10 to 80 pups. A newborn is generally long. How long tiger sharks live is unknown, but they can live longer than 12 years.

===Ontogeny=== 
Tiger shark ontogeny has been little studied until recently, but studies by Hammerschlag &quot;et al.&quot;, indicated that as they grow, their tails become more symmetrical with age. Additionally, while the heads on juvenile tiger sharks are more conical and similar to requiem sharks, adult tiger sharks have a head which is relatively broader. The reason for the larger caudal fin on juvenile tiger sharks is theorized to be an adaptation to escape predation by larger predators and to catch quicker-moving prey. As tiger sharks mature, their head also becomes much wider and their tails no longer become as large in proportion to their body size as when they are juveniles because they do not face elevated levels of predation risk upon maturity. The results of this study were interpreted as reflecting two ecological transitions: as tiger sharks mature they become more migratory and having a symmetrical tail is more advantageous in long-distance traveling, and that tiger sharks consume more diverse prey items with age, which requires a greater bite force and broader head.

==Conservation==

The tiger shark is captured and killed for its fins, flesh, and liver. It is caught regularly in target and nontarget fisheries. Several populations have declined where they have been heavily fished. Continued demand for fins may result in further declines. They are considered a near threatened species due to excessive finning and fishing by humans according to International Union for Conservation of Nature. In June 2018, the New Zealand Department of Conservation classified the tiger shark as &quot;Migrant&quot; with the qualifier &quot;Secure Overseas&quot; under the New Zealand Threat Classification System.

While shark fin has very few nutrients, shark liver has a high concentration of vitamin A, which is used in the production of vitamin oils. In addition, the tiger shark is captured and killed for its distinct skin, as well as by big-game fishers.

In 2010, Greenpeace International added the tiger shark to its seafood red list, which is a list of commonly sold fish likely to come from unsustainable fisheries.

==Relationship with humans==

Although sharks rarely bite humans, the tiger shark is reported to be responsible for a large share of fatal shark-bite incidents, and is regarded as one of the most dangerous shark species. They often visit shallow reefs, harbors, and canals, creating the potential for encounter with humans. The tiger shark also dwells in river mouths and other runoff-rich water. While it ranks second on the list of number of recorded shark attacks on humans, behind only the great white shark, such attacks are few and very seldom fatal. Typically, three to four shark bites occur per year in Hawaii; one notable survivor of such an attack is surfing champion Bethany Hamilton, who lost her left arm at age 13 to a tiger shark in 2003. This bite rate is very low, considering that thousands of people swim, surf, and dive in Hawaiian waters every day. Human interactions with tiger sharks in Hawaiian waters have been shown to increase between September and November, when tiger shark females are believed to migrate to the islands to give birth.

On 8 June 2023, a tiger shark attacked and killed a 23-year-old Russian man in the Red Sea off the coast of the Egyptian city of Hurghada. The attack was filmed by onlookers and the recording went viral. The shark was later captured by fishermen and killed. This was the third fatal tiger shark attack in the area since 2022.

Between 1959 and 1976, 4,668 tiger sharks were culled in the state of Hawaii in an effort to protect the tourism industry. Despite damaging the shark population, these efforts were shown to be ineffective in decreasing the number of interactions between humans and tiger sharks. Feeding sharks in Hawaii (except for traditional Hawaiian cultural or religious practices) is illegal, and interaction with them, such as cage diving, is discouraged. South African shark behaviorist and shark diver Mark Addison demonstrated divers could interact and dive with them outside of a shark cage in a 2007 Discovery Channel special, and underwater photographer Fiona Ayerst swam with them in the Bahamas. At &quot;Tiger Beach&quot; off Grand Bahama, uncaged diving with – and even the handling of – female tiger sharks has become a routine occurrence.

Warming Atlantic Ocean currents have caused tiger shark migration paths to move further north, according to a University of Miami study.

==Mythology==
Tiger sharks are considered to be sacred &quot;aumākua&quot; (ancestor spirits) by some native Hawaiians. Tiger sharks possess a unique significance as aumakua, revered as family guardians in Hawaiian culture. The tiger shark, regarded as an intelligent and highly perceptive spiritual entity, assumes the role of a messenger bridging the gap between humans and the divine. In the Hawaiian belief system, aumakua take on various forms, either animals or objects, representing ancestral connections and manifestations of departed family members. This perspective underscores the intricate web of interdependence among plants, animals, elements, and humans, underscoring the imperative to honor and coexist harmoniously with nature.

<doc id="233223" wikidata="Q91417" url="?curid=233223" title="Henry Villard">
<text>Henry Villard (April 10, 1835 – November 12, 1900) was an American journalist and financier who was an influential leader and the sixth president of the Northern Pacific Railway (1881–1884) which completed its trans-continental route during his tenure in 1883.

Born and raised by Ferdinand Heinrich Gustav Hilgard in the historic ancient Roman Empire border fortification, then Medieval / Middle Ages town of Speyer, along the Rhine River in the Rhenish Palatinate of the Kingdom of Bavaria. Villard clashed with his more conservative father over politics and was sent to a semi-military academy across the border in northeastern France. As a teenager, he emigrated to the United States in the 1850s without his parents&#x27; knowledge. He changed his name to Henry Villard, the name of a French classmate, to avoid being sent back to Europe, and began making his way west, briefly studying law as he developed a career in journalism. He supported famed Western explorer (&quot;The Pathfinder&quot;) and military officer in the United States Army of John C. Frémont (1813–1890), of the newly established Republican Party in his first presidential candidate campaign representing the new political party in the 1856 presidential election, and four years later followed former U.S. Representative (congressman) from Springfield, Illinois of Abraham Lincoln (1809–1865), in his bid for the American Presidency in the 1860 presidential election campaign.

Villard became a war correspondent, first covering the ensuing American Civil War (1861–1865), and later being sent back overseas by the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; to Europe (because of his childhood experiences and knowledge of foreign languages) to also cover the brief Austro-Prussian War in 1866, between two German-speaking totalitarian / authoritarian regimes fighting for political supremacy in Central Europe. It was also significant because with the quick decisive Prussian military victory over the neighboring Austrian Empire enabled the rising Kingdom of Prussia under dynamic Chancellor Otto von Bismarck (1815–1898, served Prussia 1862–1871 / Imperial Germany 1871–1890), to exclude Austria and its ruling Habsburg imperial dynasty from future German affairs and to then lead and dominate the unification campaign to create a new centralized German Empire in Central Europe. This occurred four years later in Paris after a similar defeat of rival Emperor Napoleon III of the Second French Empire and his French Army military forces of France in the subsequent Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871.

He became a pacifist as a result of his experiences covering the two conflicts at home and abroad of the Civil War and European wars In the late 1860s. He married women&#x27;s suffrage advocate Helen Frances Garrison (nicknamed &quot;Fanny&quot;) and the daughter of famed newspaper publisher and slavery abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison (1805–1879), and returned to the U.S., only to go back to Germany several years later for his health in 1870.

While in Germany, Villard became involved in investments in American railroads, and returned to the U.S. in 1874 to oversee German investments in the Oregon and California Railroad. He visited Oregon that summer, and being impressed with the region&#x27;s natural resources, began acquiring various transportation interests in the region. During the ensuing decade he acquired several rail and steamship companies, and pursued a rail line from Portland to the Pacific Ocean; he was successful, but the line cost more than anticipated, causing financial turmoil. Villard returned to Europe, helping German investors acquire stakes in the transportation network, and returned to New York in 1886.

Also in the 1880s, Villard acquired the &quot;New York Evening Post&quot; and &quot;The Nation&quot;, and established the predecessor of General Electric. He was the first benefactor of the University of Oregon, and contributed to other universities, churches, hospitals, and orphanages. He died of a stroke at his country home in New York in 1900.

==Early life and education==

He was born in Speyer, Palatinate, Kingdom of Bavaria. His parents moved to Zweibrücken in 1839, and in 1856 his father, Gustav Leonhard Hilgard (who died in 1867), became a justice of the Supreme Court of Bavaria, at Munich. He belonged to the Reformed Church. His mother, Katharina Antonia Elisabeth (Lisette) Pfeiffer, was Catholic. While he had aristocratic tendencies, he shared the republican interests of much of the Hilgard clan. His granduncle Theodore Erasmus Hilgard had emigrated to the United States during a clan move of 1833–1835 to Belleville, Illinois; the granduncle had resigned a judgeship so his children could be raised as &quot;freemen.&quot; Villard was also a distant relative of the physician and botanist George Engelmann who resided in St. Louis, Missouri.

Villard entered a &quot;Gymnasium&quot; (equivalent of a United States high school) in Zweibrücken in 1848, which he had to leave because he sympathized with the revolutions of 1848 in Germany. He had broken up a class by refusing to mention the King of Bavaria in a prayer, justifying his omission by citing his loyalty to the provisional government. Another time, after watching a session of the Frankfurt Parliament, he came home in a Hecker hat with a red feather in it. Two of his uncles were strongly in sympathy with the revolution, but his father was a conservative, and disciplined him by sending the boy to continue his education at the French semi-military academy in Phalsbourg (1849–50).
Originally his punishment was to be apprenticed, but his father compromised on the military school. Villard showed up for classes a month early so he could be tutored in the French language beforehand by the novelist Alexandre Chatrian.

==Career==
===Journalism===
On emigrating to America, he adopted the name Villard, the surname of a French schoolmate at Phalsbourg, to conceal his identity from anyone intent on making him return to Germany. Making his way westward in 1854, he lived in turn at Cincinnati; Belleville, Illinois, and Peoria, Illinois, where he studied law for a time; and Chicago where he wrote for newspapers. Along with newspaper reporting and various jobs, in 1856 he attempted unsuccessfully to establish a colony of &quot;free soil&quot; Germans in Kansas. In 1856-57 he was editor, and for part of the time was proprietor of the Racine &quot;Volksblatt&quot;, in which he advocated the election of presidential candidate John C. Frémont of the newly founded Republican Party.
Thereafter he was associated with the &quot;New Yorker Staats-Zeitung&quot;, for which he covered the Lincoln-Douglas debates; &quot;Frank Leslie&#x27;s&quot;; the &quot;New York Tribune&quot;; and with the &quot;Cincinnati Commercial Gazette&quot;. In 1859, as correspondent of the &quot;Commercial&quot;, he visited the newly discovered gold region of Colorado. On his return in 1860, he published &quot;The Pike&#x27;s Peak Gold Regions&quot;. He also sent statistics to the New York &quot;Herald&quot; that were intended to influence the location of a Pacific railroad route. He followed Lincoln throughout the 1860 presidential campaign, and was on the presidential train to Washington in 1861. He became a principal correspondent of the &quot;New York Herald&quot; in 1861. The young Villard was not content with working for a single newspaper and became a pioneer of newspaper syndication.

During the Civil War, he was correspondent for the &quot;New York Tribune&quot; (with the Army of the Potomac, 1862–63) and was at the front as the representative of a news agency established by him in that year at Washington (1864). Out of his experiences reporting the Civil War, he became a confirmed pacifist. In 1865, when Horace White became managing editor of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Villard became its Washington correspondent. In 1866, he was the correspondent of that paper in the Prusso-Austrian War. He stayed on in Europe in 1867 to report on the Paris Exposition.

At the close of the Civil War, he married Helen Frances Garrison, the daughter of the anti-slavery campaigner William Lloyd Garrison, on January 3, 1866.
He returned to the United States from his correspondent duties in Europe in June 1868, and shortly afterward was elected secretary of the American Social Science Association, to which he devoted his labors until 1870, when he went to Germany for his health.

===Transportation===

In Germany, while living at Wiesbaden, he engaged in the negotiation of American railroad securities. After the Panic of 1873, when many railroad companies defaulted in the payment of interest, he joined several committees of German bond holders, doing the major part of the committee work, and in April 1874 he returned to the United States to represent his constituents, and especially to execute an arrangement with the Oregon and California Railroad Company.

Villard first visited Portland, Oregon, in July 1874. On visiting Oregon, he was impressed with the natural wealth of the region, and conceived the plan of gaining control of its few transportation routes. His clients, who were also large creditors also of the Oregon Steamship Company, approved his scheme, and in 1875 Villard became president of both the steamship company and the Oregon and California Railroad. In 1876, he was appointed a receiver of the Kansas Pacific Railway as the representative of European creditors. He was removed in 1878, but continued the contest he had begun with Jay Gould and finally obtained better terms for the bond holders than they had agreed to accept.

The Pacific Northwest was the booming sector of American expansion. European investors in the Oregon and San Francisco Steamship Line, after building new vessels, became discouraged, and in 1879 Villard formed an American syndicate and purchased the property. He also acquired that of the Oregon Steam Navigation Company, which operated fleets of steamers and portage railroads on the Columbia River. The three companies that he controlled were amalgamated under the name of the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company.

He began the construction of a railroad up Columbia River. On failing in his effort to obtain a permanent agreement with the Northern Pacific Railway, which had begun its extension into the Washington Territory, Villard used his Columbia River steamship line as his railroad&#x27;s outlet to the Pacific Ocean. He then succeeded in obtaining a controlling interest in the Northern Pacific property, and organized a new corporation that was named the Oregon and Transcontinental Company. This acquisition was achieved with the aid of a syndicate, called by the press a &quot;blind pool&quot;, composed of friends who had loaned him $20 million without knowing his intentions. After some contention with the old managers of the Northern Pacific road, Villard was elected president of a reorganized board of directors on 15 September 1881.

After attending Thomas Edison&#x27;s 1879 Menlo Park, New Jersey, New Year&#x27;s Eve demonstration of his incandescent light bulb, Villard requested that Edison install one of his lighting systems onboard Oregon Railroad and Navigation&#x27;s new steamship, the &quot;Columbia&quot;. Although hesitant at first, Edison eventually agreed to Villard&#x27;s request. After being mostly completed at the John Roach &amp; Sons shipyard in Chester, Pennsylvania, the &quot;Columbia&quot; was sent to New York City, where Edison and his personnel installed its lighting system. This made &quot;Columbia&quot; the first commercial application of Edison&#x27;s light bulb.

With the aid of the Oregon and Transcontinental Company, his railroad line to the Pacific Ocean was completed, and it was opened to traffic with festivities in September 1883. The project had cost more than expected, and some months later these companies experienced a financial collapse. Villard&#x27;s financial embarrassment caused the collapse of the stock exchange firm of Decker, Howell, &amp; Co., and Villard&#x27;s attorney, William Nelson Cromwell, used $1,000,000 to promptly settle with creditors. On 4 January 1884, Villard resigned the presidency of the Northern Pacific. After spending the intervening time in Europe, he returned to New York City in 1886, and purchased for German capitalists large amounts of the securities of the transportation system that he was instrumental in creating, becoming again director of the Northern Pacific, and on 21 June 1888, again president of the Oregon and Transcontinental Company.

===More acquisitions and mergers===
In 1881, he acquired the &quot;New York Evening Post&quot; and &quot;The Nation&quot;. Villard installed a triumvirate of editors, consisting of his friends Carl Schurz, Edwin L. Godkin and Horace White. White also helped manage Villard&#x27;s railroad and steamship interests 1876–1891. They had met as newspaper reporters during the Civil War.

Villard had also had a hand in the large electric power business founded by Thomas Edison, merging the Edison Electric Light Company, Edison Lamp Company of Newark, New Jersey, and the Edison Machine Works at Schenectady, New York, to form the Edison General Electric Company. Villard was the president of this concern until 1892 when he was forced out after financier J. P. Morgan engineered a merger with the Thomson-Houston Electric Company that put that company&#x27;s board in control of the new enterprise, renamed General Electric.

===Philanthropy===
In 1883, he paid the debt of the University of Oregon, and gave the institution $50,000. As the University of Oregon&#x27;s first benefactor, he had Villard Hall, the second building on campus, named after him. 
He liberally aided the University of Washington Territory. He also aided Harvard University, Columbia University, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the American Museum of Natural History.

In Speyer he was a main benefactor for the construction of the Memorial Church and a new hospital. There he is still known as Heinrich Hilgard, and a street is named after him (Hilgardstrasse). He has been honoured with the freedom of the city, and there is a bust of him on the compound of the Speyer Diakonissen Hospital.

In Zweibrücken he built an orphanage in 1891. He has also financed a school for nurses. He devoted large sums to the Industrial Art School of Rhenish Bavaria, and to the foundation of fifteen scholarships for the youth of that province.

He supported archaeologist Adolph Bandelier in his research on South American history and archaeology.

==Personal life==

In January 1866, he married women&#x27;s suffrage advocate Helen Frances Garrison (1844–1928), the only daughter of abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison. Together, they were the parents of:

* Helen Elise Villard (1868–1917), who married Dr. James William Bell, an English physician, in 1897, and was a semi-invalid most of her life due to a childhood fall down an elevator shaft at the Westmoreland House.
* Harold Garrison Villard (1869–1952), who married Mariquita Serrano (1864–1936), sister of actor Vincent Serrano, in 1897.
* Oswald Garrison Villard (1872–1949), who married Julia Breckenridge Sanford (1876–1962) and who succeeded his father as owner and publisher of the New York Evening Post and The Nation.
* Henry Hilgard Villard (1883–1890), who died young.

Henry Villard died of a stroke at his country home, Thorwood Park, in Dobbs Ferry, New York. He was interred in the Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Sleepy Hollow, New York. His autobiography was published posthumously, in 1904. The monument at his grave site was executed by Karl Bitter.

Three years after his death, his daughter Helen brought a suit against the executors and trustees of his will. She claimed that Villard was of unsound mind when he made the will and was the result of fraudulent influence exercised over him by his wife and his two sons. In the will, she was only left $25,000 due to the fact that she married against her father&#x27;s wishes. She contended that there was no mention of the $200,000 worth of securities she said her father claimed to have left her. Helen lost her suit as the Judge ruled in 1905 that her delay in filing suit had forfeited the right to attack the will. An appeal was rejected by the courts in 1910.

===Descendants===
Through his son Harold, he was the grandfather of Henry Serrano Villard (1900–1996), the foreign service officer and ambassador, and Vincent Serrano Villard, and Mariquita Villard Platov.

Through his son Oswald, he was the grandfather of Dorothea Marshall Villard Hammond (1907–1994), a member of the American University in Cairo, Henry Hilgard Villard (1911–1983), the head of the economics department at the City College of New York and the first male president of Planned Parenthood of New York City, and Oswald Garrison Villard Jr. (1916–2004), a professor of electrical engineering at Stanford University.

===Residences===
In the late 1870s, Villard bought an old country estate known as &quot;Thorwood Park&quot; in Dobbs Ferry, New York. The home, which featured sweeping views of the Hudson River, was renovated by Charles Follen McKim of McKim, Mead and White in the early 1880s.

In 1884, Villard hired Joseph M. Wells of the architecture firm McKim, Mead and White to design and construct the Villard Houses, which appear as one building but in fact is six separate residences. The houses are located at 455 Madison Avenue between 50th and 51st Street in Manhattan with four of the homes opening onto the courtyard facing Madison, while the other two had entrances on 51st Street. The homes are in the Romanesque Revival style with neo-Renaissance touches and feature elaborate interiors by prominent artists including John La Farge, Augustus Saint-Gaudens, and Maitland Armstrong.

After Villard&#x27;s bankruptcy, the Villard House was purchased by Elisabeth Mills Reid (1857–1931), wife of Whitelaw Reid, a diplomat and the editor of the &quot;New York Tribune&quot;, and the daughter of Darius Ogden Mills and the sister of Ogden Mills, bankers and financiers.

<doc id="233226" wikidata="Q780866" url="?curid=233226" title="Austin-class amphibious transport dock">
<text>The &quot;Austin&quot; class was a class of twelve amphibious transport dock ships in service with the United States Navy from 1965 to 2017. Note that the U.S. Naval Vessel Registry list separate &quot;Cleveland&quot; (seven built) and &quot;Trenton&quot; (two built) class ships, but most sources lists them as a single class. &quot;Trenton&quot; was sold to India and is the only ship still active.

==Design==
The &quot;Austin&quot; class was an enlarged version of the preceding . Designed under project SCB 187B, the ships are about longer which increased the displacement by some 3,300 tons. The dock is as large as that of the &quot;Raleigh&quot;-class. In front of the dock was a 70m long raised level to park vehicles which was connected via a ramp to the flight deck. The ramp ended in a new telescoping hangar. Although the flight deck had room for up to six CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters, the hangar was only a temporary shelter for a single helicopter and not a permanent facility. The propulsion consists of two Foster Wheeler boilers (600 psi), powering two De Laval GT turbines, providing 12,000 SHP each for the two propellers.

The reason for creating a &quot;Cleveland&quot;/&quot;Trenton&quot; sub-class is that the last nine ships of the class were built as flagships for amphibious ready groups with an additional deck above the bridge and accommodations for additional 90 personnel. The SPS-40 radar is also placed higher on the mast. Otherwise the ships are identical. Originally the ships were armed only with four 3-inch/50-caliber gun Mark 33 twin mounts. These were later removed and the weapon stations were used to fit two Phalanx CIWS.

The last ship of the class, LPD-16, while authorized, was cancelled before being constructed. served for 10 years as an LPD before she was converted into a command ship. She kept her hull number and was redesignated AGF-11. From 2012 to 2017, served with the United States Military Sealift Command as a forward base ship with helicopter facilities, which was designated &quot;Afloat Forward Staging Base, Interim&quot;.

<doc id="233228" wikidata="Q2691121" url="?curid=233228" title="Cloudbase">
<text>Spectrum Cloudbase, often shortened to Cloudbase, is the fictional airborne headquarters of the international security organisation Spectrum in Gerry Anderson&#x27;s science fiction television series &quot;Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons&quot; (1967–1968). In the 2005 animated remake, Cloudbase is re-imagined as Skybase.

In both series, the base&#x27;s design is that of an airborne aircraft carrier, stationed in either Earth&#x27;s high troposphere (in the original series) or low stratosphere (in the remake).

==Origin and design==
While developing the series in 1966, Gerry Anderson remembered that during the Battle of Britain the RAF had found it difficult to counter the Luftwaffe due to the delays caused by having to launch fighters from the ground. In his biography, he recalled that &quot;it took [the Spitfire squadron] about 20 minutes to climb high enough to intercept the bombers that were already at 16,000 feet.&quot; It was for this reason that Anderson decided to make Spectrum&#x27;s headquarters a hovering airborne aircraft carrier: &quot;This could launch aircraft that would then climb to 100,000 feet and intercept extraterrestrial invaders within minutes.&quot; In a separate interview, he noted that &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; was made during the Cold War, &quot;when world leaders held conferences on aircraft carriers, and bomber pilots were constantly in the air waiting for attack orders. So I was thinking along the lines of a wartime setting, and had the idea for Cloudbase, a giant flying aircraft carrier, and the Angels, fighter pilots ready for take-off at any time.

The original script for the first episode stated that the base is kept airborne by &quot;powerful jet engines that are pointing downwards and are obviously powered by atomic energy&quot;.

The Cloudbase filming model was designed by special effects director Derek Meddings and measured over in length. According to Meddings, it was the easiest &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; vehicle to build. The base&#x27;s wide-angle establishing shot, repeatedly re-used as stock footage, was filmed against a sky backdrop consisting of a background painting, cotton wool clouds and dry ice effects. Too heavy to be hung on wires, the model was held in place on the end of a horizontal metal pole. Larger-scale sections of the flight deck were built for scenes showing aircraft taking off and landing.

The puppet-size control room set incorporated green Perspex arches and a electrically-driven moving walkway from which the character Lieutenant Green operates the base&#x27;s main computer. Anderson said that the decision to have Colonel White sit at a round desk, so that during briefings all the attending officers are equidistant from him, was influenced by contemporary speculation about the seating arrangements for cabinet meetings, which were typically held at long conference tables and reportedly led to disputes over which members should sit nearest to heads of government.

==Depiction==
Resembling an aircraft carrier, complete with flight deck and powered by jet engines, Cloudbase hovers at a fixed altitude of . Though usually geostationary, it is equipped with horizontal jet thrusters that enable it to be moved to any point above the Earth&#x27;s surface. It was constructed in Earth orbit and has a crew of approximately 600. The base is pressurised; pilots entering or exiting aircraft on the flight deck do so via airtight shafts and docking ports.

Cloudbase&#x27;s main defence is its squadron of three Angel Interceptor fighter aircraft, flown by five female pilots. One fighter is crewed around the clock, with the others on continuous standby. Auxiliary aircraft include Spectrum Passenger Jets and Magnacopters, which are launched from a different area of the flight deck.

Areas aboard Cloudbase include:

*The Control Room, containing Colonel White&#x27;s revolving round desk, a viewing screen (which displays the spectral colours when inactive) and Lieutenant Green&#x27;s mainframe computer, which controls the base&#x27;s systems
*The Amber Room, the standby lounge for the Angel pilots
*The Spectrum Information Centre, containing &quot;seventh-generation&quot; supercomputers
*The Observation Room, containing atmospheric and space-monitoring equipment
*The Room of Sleep, where hypnosis and gimbal-mounted beds minimise the time required for personnel to rest
*The Sick Bay, staffed by chief medical officer Dr Fawn
*Conference Room, Generator Room, Radar Room and Lounge

==Reception==
Commentator Ian Fryer praises the interior sets designed by Keith Wilson, noting their use of coloured Perspex and describing them as &quot;both stylish and highly detailed&quot;.

Cloudbase has also been viewed as part of a supposed religious allegory in the series. Commentators have suggested that the base can be interpreted as Heaven, with Colonel White serving as a God analogue and the resurrected Captain Scarlet representing the Son of God; the Devil is symbolised by either Captain Black or the Mysterons. Both Robin Turner of Wales Online and Chris Jenkins of &quot;Total DVD&quot; magazine compare White to God seated in his &quot;heavenly Cloudbase&quot; (defended by a fighter squadron that happens to be codenamed &quot;the Angels&quot;). Anderson denied that any of this symbolism was intentional.

An article published by the University of Leicester considered the feasibility of Cloudbase as an airborne aircraft carrier. Using the specifications of a &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class aircraft carrier, it was calculated that if Cloudbase were a uniformly dense cuboid it would weigh more than 30 billion newtons () when hovering, needing thruster power equivalent to more than half a million Eurofighter Typhoons and energy equivalent to the output of more than 600,000 nuclear power stations in order to maintain its altitude. The article concluded that the phenomenal weight, noise and heat created by such power requirements made Cloudbase a real-world impossibility.

The &quot;Valiant&quot;, an airborne aircraft carrier featured in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; universe, has been compared to Cloudbase. The similarity is directly recognised in series 8, when the Twelfth Doctor refers to the &quot;Valiant&quot; as &quot;Cloudbase&quot;. Comparisons have also been drawn with the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier from the Marvel Universe and the mobile airstrip from the 2004 film &quot;Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow&quot;.

In 1993, toy company Vivid Imaginations released a Cloudbase playset. In 2001, &quot;The Independent&quot; listed it as one of the 50 best Christmas toys. The Toy Retailers Association also ranked it among the top 50 toys of the year. A secret project in the expansion pack for the 1999 video game &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Alpha Centauri&quot; is titled &quot;Cloudbase Academy&quot;.

==Skybase==
In the animated remake &quot;New Captain Scarlet&quot; (2005), Cloudbase is re-imagined as Skybase. Stationed at , the redesigned headquarters has robotic deckhands on the flight deck to assist with the take-off and landing of aircraft. The base is protected by a fleet of Falcon Interceptors (the updated Angel aircraft) and, in addition to the facilities previously featured, is equipped with squash courts.

In a 2004 interview, Anderson said that the changes from the original were for commercial reasons, &quot;so that merchandising opportunities aren&#x27;t confused and all the revenue goes to another company.&quot; He likened the role of the deckhands to &quot;a Formula One pit stop&quot;.

The CGI model was created using LightWave 3D software under the supervision of Ron Thornton, co-founder of animation studio Foundation Imaging (whose commissions included the &quot;Star Trek&quot; series and films). The model – which at three million polygons (described by Thornton as &quot;way over the top&quot;), was originally three times the size of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; NX-01 from &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; – was too large to be rendered in a single step.

<text>The &quot;San Antonio&quot; class is a class of amphibious transport docks, also called a &quot;landing platform, dock&quot; (LPD), used by the United States Navy. These warships replace the LPDs (including &quot;Cleveland&quot; and &quot;Trenton&quot; sub-classes), as well as the tank landing ships, the dock landing ships, and the amphibious cargo ships that have already been retired.

Twelve ships of the &quot;San Antonio&quot; class were originally proposed, their original target price was US$890 million; as built, their average cost is $1.6 billion. Defense Authorization for Fiscal Year 2015 included partial funding for the twelfth &quot;San Antonio&quot;-class ship. eleven warships of this class were in service with the U.S. Navy, with an additional three ships under construction. The Navy decided in 2018 to produce a second flight of 13 planned LPD Flight II ships, for a total of 26 in the LPD 17 class; LPD 30, &quot;Harrisburg&quot;, is the first Flight II ship.

The &quot;San Antonio&quot; class was designed to provide the Navy and U.S. Marine Corps with modern, sea-based platforms that are networked, survivable, and built to operate with 21st century transformational platforms, such as the MV-22 Osprey, the (since canceled) Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV), air-cushioned landing craft (LCACs), and future means by which Marines are delivered ashore. The ship is more than 45 percent larger than the &quot;Austin&quot; class, displacing more than 25,000 tons at full load. It carries fewer troops, but has twice as much space for vehicles, landing craft, and aircraft. The ships are also suited to act as recovery ships for spacecraft, with a floodable well deck at the back of the vessel into which a capsule can float; was the recovery ship for the Orion capsule of the Artemis 1 uncrewed Moon-orbiting mission on 11 December 2022.

The project embraced a &quot;Design for Ownership&quot; philosophy; a concurrent engineering approach that injects operator, maintainer, and trainer input into the design development process. The goal was to ensure that operational realities are considered throughout the total ship design, integration, construction, test and life cycle support of the new ships and their systems. This process was intended to improve combat readiness, enhance quality of life, and reduce Total Ownership Costs, and resulted in numerous changes during the project.

The &quot;San Antonio&quot; class has significant survivability features and computer technology. In addition to Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) protection from air threats, the class was designed to minimize radar signature. Techniques that reduce radar cross-section (RCS) make the ships more difficult to locate and target. Enhanced survivability features include improved nuclear blast and fragmentation protection and a shock-hardened structure. The fiber-optic shipboard-wide area network (SWAN) connects onboard-integrated systems. The network will allow &quot;plug in and fight&quot; configuration, updating and replacing hardware more easily when newer technology becomes available. Moreover, the class has extensive communications, command, control, and intelligence systems to support current and projected expeditionary warfare missions of the 21st century.

The class is fitted with the integrated Ship Self-Defense System (SSDS). The system fuses the radars and other sensors and controls the weapons systems for an automated fast reaction capability against air threats.

The Advanced Enclosed Mast/Sensors (AEM/S) System mast, a 93-foot-high octagonal structure 35 feet in diameter, is constructed of a multi-layer frequency-selective composite material. It is designed to permit the ship&#x27;s own sensor frequencies with very low loss while reflecting other frequencies. The tapered octagonal shape of the AEM/S is designed to reduce the radar cross section, and enclosing the antennas provides improved performance and greatly reduces maintenance costs. The composite mast was replaced by a conventional mast starting from USS &quot;Fort Lauderdale&quot; as a transition to the LX(R)-class amphibious warfare ship design.

The &quot;San Antonio&quot;-class also incorporates the latest quality of life standards for the embarked Marines and sailors, including sit-up berths, a ship services mall, a learning resource center, and a fitness center. Medical facilities include two operating rooms and 124 beds. Additionally, they are the first USN ships designed to accommodate sailors and Marines of both sexes as part of the crew and embarked troops.

By mid-2016, the Navy and Marine Corps were studying installing a vertical launch system (VLS) into &quot;San Antonio&quot;-class ships so they could field larger offensive missiles. The original ship concept included two 8-cell Mk 41 VLS in the bow, which is being reexamined to add Tomahawk cruise missiles to support Marines ashore with little modification to the combat system.

==History==
Following the extended problems and incidents experienced by , the U.S. Department of Defense&#x27;s Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&amp;E), stated in 2010 that the ships are &quot;capable of operating &#x27;in a benign environment&#x27;, but not effective, suitable and not survivable in a combat situation&quot;. The DOT&amp;E found in 2011 that the first ship of the class, USS &quot;San Antonio&quot;, had several deficiencies which rendered it &quot;not operationally effective, suitable, or survivable in a hostile environment&quot;. In April 2015, the USN proposed adding a 12th ship to the class, which will be built at Ingalls in exchange for a destroyer to be named later. On 4 December 2015, the 12th ship was ordered.

===Derivatives===
U.S. senator Kay Hagan has asked if the LPD-17 construction line should be extended to a 12th ship as a bridge to building the LX(R) (formerly LSD(X)) on the same hull, but the USN has indicated that the requirements of the LX(R) have not yet been settled and that the LPD-17 hull might be too large for such a mission. However, Commandant James F. Amos had also endorsed dropping LSD in favor of continued LPD production.

In October 2014, Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus signed an internal memo recommending that the LX(R) warship be based on the existing &quot;San Antonio&quot;-class design. The LPD-17 design was selected over a foreign variant, and an entirely new design to meet required capability, capacity, and cost parameters. Official selection of basing the LX(R) off the LPD-17 design still has to come with Milestone A approval. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 included partial funding for a twelfth &quot;San Antonio&quot;-class ship (LPD-28). In early 2014, Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII) displayed its Flight IIA version of the LPD-17 hull for the Navy&#x27;s LX(R) amphibious ship. The design is further modified by removing some of the higher-end capabilities of the &quot;San Antonio&quot; class to create an &quot;amphibious truck&quot; to replace the and landing ship docks. The Flight IIA has improved command and control (C2) features over the LSDs, half the medical spaces of the LPD-17, a smaller hangar, no composite masts, two unspecified main propulsion diesel engines (MPDE), two spots for LCACs or one LCU, a reduced troop capacity (500), and a crew of about 400 sailors. In January 2015, the Navy and Marine Corps decided to go with the modified LPD-17 hull for the LX(R) program.

Chief of Naval Operations Greenert considered using some of the extra space in the &quot;San Antonio&quot; class to mount modular equipment in the same fashion as the littoral combat ships. As part of their bid to offer &quot;Flight II&quot; LPD-17s for the dock landing ship replacement contract, HII has suggested fitting out the ships to carry the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System. Although there is no formal requirement for the BMD variant, HII report unofficial support for it within the U.S. Navy, such that it will be modeled in wargame scenarios in 2016 and 2017. It could accommodate up to 288 Mk41 VLS missile tubes and a radar with 1000 times the sensitivity of the SPY-1D radar of the Burke destroyers.

===Flight II===

On 2 August 2018, the U.S. Navy and Huntington Ingalls signed a contract for long lead items for LPD-30, the first of the 13-ship more affordable Flight II class. The contract was for US$165.5M. The cost goal is for US$1.64B for the first ship, and $1.4B for subsequent ships. LPD-30 will be fitted with a Raytheon AN/SPY-6 &quot;Enterprise Air Surveillance Radar&quot;, an upgrade over the AN/SPS-48 currently in LPD-17s. Huntington Ingalls will build the new flight exclusively. On 26 March 2019, Huntington Ingalls announced the award of a US$1.47 billion, fixed-price incentive contract for LPD 30 (14th ship and first of Flight II). On 10 October 2019, the name of the ship was announced as for Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, the state&#x27;s capital. On 3 April 2020, Huntington Ingalls announced that it was awarded a $1.5 billion contract modification for the construction of , named for Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

The Flight II ships are intended to provide the mission currently provided by the Whidbey Island-class dock landing ships and incorporate more than 200 changes over the Flight I ships. The mission provided by Flight II ships will include airport, seaport, and hospital operations and incorporate modifications to the ships’ well decks. 

, the US Navy is proposing to temporarily halt acquiring additional &quot;San Antonio&quot; class ships beyond LPD-32. This move would be part of a &quot;strategic pause,&quot; according to Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro, that would allow the force to better examine what they need to get out of the ships and how many they ultimately need. Under this plan, LPD-32 would be purchased in the 2022–2023 fiscal year.

In August 2024, Congress authorized the Navy to begin a multi-year procurement of three ships. The multi-year procurement deal, spanning FY25 to FY29, will save an estimated $901M compared to individual ship buys. These three ships are excluded from this page&#x27;s &quot;on order&quot; counts until formally executed.

<doc id="233234" wikidata="Q308976" url="?curid=233234" title="Silica gel">
<text>Silica gel is an amorphous and porous form of silicon dioxide (silica), consisting of an irregular tridimensional framework of alternating silicon and oxygen atoms with nanometer-scale voids and pores. The voids may contain water or some other liquids, or may be filled by gas or vacuum. In the last case, the material is properly called silica xerogel.

Silica xerogel with an average pore size of 2.4 nanometers has a strong affinity for water molecules and is widely used as a desiccant. It is hard and translucent, but considerably softer than massive silica glass or quartz, and remains hard when saturated with water.

Silica xerogel is usually commercialized as coarse granules or beads, a few millimeters in diameter. Some grains may contain small amounts of indicator substance that changes color when they have absorbed some water. Small paper envelopes containing silica xerogel pellets, usually with a &quot;do not eat&quot; warning, are often included in dry food packages to absorb any humidity that might cause spoilage of the food.

&#x27;Wet&#x27; silica gel, as may be freshly prepared from alkali silicate solutions, may vary in consistency from a soft transparent gel, similar to gelatin or agar, to a hard solid, namely a water-logged xerogel. It is sometimes used in laboratory processes, for example to suppress convection in liquids or prevent settling of suspended particles.

==History==
Silica gel was in existence as early as the 1640s as a scientific curiosity. It was used in World War I for the adsorption of vapors and gases in gas mask canisters. The synthetic route for producing silica gel was patented in 1918 by Walter A. Patrick, a chemistry professor at Johns Hopkins University.

==Types==
Silica alumina gel - light yellow, chemically stable, flame-resistant, insoluble except in alkali or hydrofluoric acid. Superficial polarity, thermal stability, performance greater than fine-pored silica gel.

Stabilizing silica gel - non-crystalline micro-porous solid powder, nontoxic, flame-resisting, used in brewery of grains for beer to improve taste, clearness, color, and foam and for removal of non-micro-organism impurities.

==Properties==
Silica gel&#x27;s high specific surface areaaround allows it to adsorb water readily, making it useful as a desiccant (drying agent). Silica gel is often described as &quot;absorbing&quot; moisture, which may be appropriate when the gel&#x27;s microscopic structure is ignored, as in silica gel packs or other products. However, material silica gel removes moisture by adsorption onto the surface of its numerous pores rather than by absorption into the bulk of the gel.

Silica gel is able to adsorb up to 37% of its own weight in moisture in high-humidity environments. This moisture can be released upon heating at about for 1–2 hours. This makes it reusable multiple times with very little, if any, loss of efficiency.

==Preparation==
An aqueous solution of sodium silicate is acidified to produce a gelatinous precipitate that is washed, then dehydrated to produce colorless silica gel. When a visible indication of the moisture content of the silica gel is required, ammonium tetrachlorocobaltate(II) (NH4)2[CoCl4] or cobalt(II) chloride CoCl2 is added. This will cause the gel to be blue when dry and pink when hydrated. Due to a link between the cobalt chloride and cancer, it has been forbidden in Europe for use in silica gel. An alternative indicator is methyl violet which is orange when dry and green when hydrated.

==Uses==

===Desiccant===
====Initial use====
Moisture can cause mold and spoilage in many items. It can also damage electronics by causing condensation and shorten the lifespan of chemicals, like those in vitamins. Silica gel packets help by absorbing moisture and extending the life of these items.

Silica gel may also be used to keep the relative humidity inside a high frequency radio or satellite transmission system waveguide as low as possible (see also &quot;humidity buffering&quot;). Excessive moisture buildup within a waveguide can cause arcing inside the waveguide itself, damaging the power amplifier feeding it. Also, the beads of water that form and condense inside the waveguide change the characteristic impedance and frequency, degrading the signal. It is common for a small compressed air system (similar to a small home aquarium pump) to be employed to circulate the air inside the waveguide over a jar of silica gel.

Silica gel is also used to dry the air in industrial compressed air systems. Air from the compressor discharge flows through a bed of silica gel beads. The silica gel adsorbs moisture from the air, preventing damage at the point of use of the compressed air due to condensation or moisture. The same system is used to dry the compressed air on railway locomotives, where condensation and ice in the brake air pipes can lead to brake failure.

Prior to widespread use of air-conditioning, salt shakers with caps containing silica gel beads to keep the salt dry enough to prevent clumping were marketed in the US, replacing the practice of including a few grains of rice in salt shakers to effect the same drying.

Silica gel is sometimes used as a preservation tool to control relative humidity in museum and library exhibitions and storage.

Other applications include diagnostic test strips, inhalation devices, syringes, drug test kits, and hospital sanitation kits.

Silica gel is commonly described as a way to remove moisture from phones and electronics accidentally exposed to water, but there are no known controlled studies that compare its actual efficacy compared to simple air or fan exposure. The average person is also unlikely to have a sufficient quantity of ready-to-use activated or regenerated silica gel.

====Regeneration====
Once saturated with water, the gel may be regenerated by heating it to about for 1–2 hours. Some types of silica gel will &quot;pop&quot; when exposed to enough water. This is caused by breakage of the silica spheres when contacting the water.

Regenerating silica gel is important for both economic and environmental reasons. It can be regenerated thermally or chemically. Chemical methods involve the use of desiccating agents or solvents to desorb water from silica gel, though these are generally less practical for routine regeneration. Thermal regeneration can be applied also to packed silica gel beds without opening them. Thermal regeneration can be conventional heating in an oven at temperature of about . Another option for thermal regeneration is by using microwaves to apply heat more evenly and reduce regeneration time compared to conventional ovens, but this process should be tightly controlled to avoid overheating. Yet another option to apply heat is using a solar heater with a compound parabolic concentrator. There are also studies on using ultrasonic waves to remove water molecules from silica gel at which are lower temperatures than that of conventional heating.

===Chemistry===

In chemistry, silica gel is used in chromatography as a stationary phase. In column chromatography, the stationary phase is most often composed of silica gel particles of 40–63 μm. Different particle sizes are used for different kinds of column chromatography as the particle size is related to surface area. The differences in particle size dictate if the silica gel should be used for flash or gravity chromatography. In this application, due to silica gel&#x27;s polarity, non-polar components tend to elute before more polar ones, hence the name normal phase chromatography. However, when hydrophobic groups (such as C18 groups) are attached to the silica gel then polar components elute first and the method is referred to as reverse phase chromatography. Silica gel is also applied to aluminium, glass, or plastic sheets for thin layer chromatography.

The hydroxy (OH) groups on the surface of silica can be functionalized to afford specialty silica gels that exhibit unique stationary phase parameters. These so-called functionalized silica gels are also used in organic synthesis and purification as insoluble reagents and scavengers.

Chelating groups have also been covalently bound to silica gel. These materials have the ability to remove metal ions selectively from aqueous solutions. Chelating groups can be covalently bound to polyamines that have been grafted onto a silica gel surface producing a material of greater mechanical integrity. Silica gel is also combined with alkali metals to form a M-SG reducing agent. (See SiGNa chemistry)

Silica gel is not expected to biodegrade in either water or soil.

===Cat litter===
Silica gel is also used as cat litter, by itself or in combination with more traditional materials, such as clays including bentonite. It is non-tracking and virtually odorless.

===Food additive===
Silica gel, also referred to as silicon dioxide or synthetic amorphous silica (SAS), is listed by the FDA in the United States as generally recognized as safe (GRAS), meaning it can be added to food products without needing approval. Silica is allowed to be added to food in the US at up to 2% as permitted under 21 CFR 172.480. In the EU, it can be in up to 5% concentrations. In 2018, a re-evaluation by the EFSA Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food found no indications of toxicity even at the highest estimates of exposure level.

Listed uses include: anticaking agent, defoaming agent, stabilizer, adsorbent, carrier, conditioning agent, chill proofing agent, filter aid, emulsifying agent, viscosity control agent, and anti-settling agent. Silica can be found commonly in foods including baked goods, spices and herbs, dairy products, cocoa products, and more.

===Water filtration===
Given the water adsorption properties of silica gel, it is used in domestic water filters. The surface structure of silica gel allows the adsorption of some minerals that are dissolved in the water, or &quot;Ion-exchange&quot; as it is marketed. Due to the lack of regulations for domestic water filtration products, no studies validate the manufacturer claims regarding the effectiveness of the filtration system. 

===Humidity indicator (color-changing silica gel)===
Silica gel may be doped with a moisture indicator that gradually changes its color when it transitions from the anhydrous (dry) state to the hydrated (wet) state. Common indicators are cobalt(II) chloride and methyl violet. Cobalt (II) chloride is deep blue when dry and pink when wet, but it is toxic and carcinogenic, and was reclassified by the European Union in July 2000 as a toxic material. Methyl violet may be formulated to change from orange to green, or orange to colorless. It also is toxic and potentially carcinogenic, but is safe enough to have medicinal uses.
Ferric and ferrous salts, sometimes combined with small amounts of sodium hydroxide, provide a better alternative. In particular, ferric sulfate and double salts like ammonium iron(III) sulfate (iron alum), ammonium iron(II) sulfate, and potassium iron(III) sulfate all result in a color change from amber/yellow when dry to colorless/white when saturated.

==Hazards==
Silica gel is non-toxic, and non-reactive and stable with ordinary usage. It will react with hydrogen fluoride, fluorine, oxygen difluoride, chlorine trifluoride, strong acids, strong bases, and oxidizers. Silica gel is irritating to the respiratory tract and may cause irritation of the digestive tract. Dust from the beads may cause irritation to the skin and eyes, so precautions should be taken. Crystalline silica dust can cause silicosis, but synthetic amorphous silica gel is indurated, so it does not cause silicosis. Additional hazards may occur when doped with a humidity indicator.

, also known simply as Acuña, (originally [[José María Garza Galán|Garza Galán]], later Villa Acuña) is a city located in the Mexican state of Coahuila, at 
 and a mean height above sea level of . It stands on the Rio Grande (locally known as the Río Bravo), which marks the U.S.-Mexico border, and offers two border crossings via Lake Amistad Dam International Crossing and Del Río-Ciudad Acuña International Bridge with the neighboring city of Del Rio in the U.S. state of Texas. It serves as the municipal seat of the surrounding municipality of Acuña. The 2017 estimated city population was 201,778, whereas the municipality&#x27;s population was 214,616. The city is the fourth-largest in the state of Coahuila and the fastest-growing city in Mexico. The area is served by the Ciudad Acuña International Airport.

The Del Rio-Ciudad Acuña Metropolitan Area (DR-CA) is the seventh-largest binational metropolitan area along the United States-Mexican border. The city of Del Rio is situated in the U.S. state of Texas on the north side of the Rio Grande and Ciudad Acuña is located in the Mexican state of Coahuila south of the river. This metropolitan area is also known as &quot;Tierra de la Amistad&quot;.

The Del Rio micropolitan area&#x27;s population was 55,000 people in 2015, and the Ciudad Acuña Metropolitan Area&#x27;s population was 225,000 people in 2015.
The 2015 population of Greater Del Rio-Ciudad Acuña binational metropolitan area is 280,000.

== History ==
The first recorded settlement of Acuña took place on 27 December 1877. It was founded by a group of colonists led by Domingo Urias, Irineo Casillas Arevalo, and his wife Maximina Espinoza. At the same time, the governor of the state was general Hipólito Charles, who posted a military garrison in the area led by Captain Manuel Leal. In 1880, the community received &quot;villa&quot; (town) status under its first name of Garza Galán. In 1884, the locality was renamed Congregación las Vacas. Congregacion las Vacas was then renamed Villa Acuña in 1912 after Saltillan poet Manuel Acuña. Villa Acuña was finally given the title of city on 16 September 1951 by Don JesusMaria Ramon, when it got its present name of Ciudad Acuña.

On 24 October 1960, US President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Mexican President Adolfo López Mateos met in Acuña to sign the initial agreements allowing construction of the dam. Construction plans were not finalized until December 1966, when Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and Gustavo Díaz Ordaz met on the international bridge. Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Gustavo Díaz Ordaz met for the dedication of Amistad Dam on 8 September 1969.

Originally created to serve airmen at Laughlin AFB just across the border, &quot;Boys&#x27; Town&quot; is an entertainment district located in an area south of Ciudad Acuña and contains a few after-hours bars and brothels, but is designated off-limits to U.S. military personnel.

On 25 May 2015, an F3 tornado struck the city, causing incredible damage and killing 14 people and injuring 200 more.

== Economy ==
Various foreign companies have opened factories, or &quot;maquiladoras&quot; in Acuña, given its status as being 100% union-free. These include Irvin Automotive Products (automotive seat components), Howmet de Mexico (aerospace parts), Bendix (brake and hydraulic parts), Gentherm de Mexico (automotive seat heaters), Caterpillar (mining truck components), RESCO Electronics (wiring harness and cable assembly manufacturing), and Toter Incorporated (waste receptacles, curbside roll-out carts). 

==Education==

According to the Secretariat of Public Education, there are 223 schools in the Acuña municipality, of which 13 are starter schools, 64 preschool, 68 primary, 36 lower secondary (junior high school), 30 higher secondary (high school), 7 colleges and 4 vocational schools.

Prior to 2009, many students living in this city used their relatives&#x27; addresses who lived in the U.S. to attend schools in the San Felipe Del Rio Consolidated Independent School District, on the U.S. side. Minors were being interrogated at the border without an adult present, which caused much controversy, since that is illegal, and not all students had only one home. Many of their parents worked in the Del Rio side of the border and legally paid taxes. More than 400 students never came back.

==Media==
=== Radio ===
In the 1930s in Villa Acuña, now Ciudad Acuña, the border blaster XERF-AM made its home. The radio station was built by John R. Brinkley from the U.S. state of Kansas. Brinkley claimed to be able to cure male virility deficiency with goat gland transplants. Brinkley wanted to promote his male enhancement operations and used the radio station for that purpose. Because of the purpose of radio XER and what it promoted, the station was closed in 1939 by the Mexican government.

In 1947, the government of Mexico licensed XER, the 100 kW super-power border blaster run by Ramon D. Bosquez. They used the old XERA facilities and sold its airtime to American evangelists broadcasting in English to the United States. In 1959, Ramon D. Bosquez and Arturo Gonzalez formed the Inter-American Radio Advertising, Inc. in Del Rio. They ran the broadcasting in Del Rio while the license rested in the hands of Mexican officials. They boosted the power to 250 kW.

Since 1987 XERF-AM (called &quot;La Poderosa&quot;) is under control of the Instituto Mexicano de la Radio. It plays Spanish-language programs, news and music, broadcasting at 1570 kHz. Since 2012, its FM twin station is XHRF-FM, broadcasting at 103.9 kHz with 100,000 watts of transmitting power.

<text>Unisex is an adjective indicating something is not sex-specific, i.e. is suitable for any type of sex. The term can also mean gender-blindness or gender neutrality.

The term &#x27;unisex&#x27; was coined in the 1960s and was used fairly informally. The combining prefix &quot;uni-&quot; is from Latin &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;one&quot; or &quot;single&quot;. However, &#x27;unisex&#x27; seems to have been influenced by words such as &quot;united&quot; and &quot;universal&quot;, in which &quot;uni-&quot; takes the related sense &quot;shared&quot;. Unisex then means &quot;shared by sexes&quot;.

==Examples==
Hair stylists and beauty salons that serve both men and women are often referred to as unisex. This is also typical of other services and products that had traditionally been separated by sexes, such as clothing shops or beauty products. Public toilets are commonly sex segregated but if that is not the case, they are referred to as unisex public toilets. Unisex clothing includes garments like T-shirts; versions of other garments may be tailored for the different fits depending on one&#x27;s sex, such as jeans. The sharing of a pool or recreational facility by swimmers and others of various sexes is commonly referred to as mixed bathing. When a school admits students of various sexes, it may be called coeducational or a mixed-sex school.

<doc id="233242" wikidata="Q15710461" url="?curid=233242" title="List of heads of government of Romania">
<text>This is a list consisting of all the heads of government of modern and contemporary Romania (i.e. prime ministers, both in full constitutional powers and acting or ad interim), since the establishment of the United Principalities in 1859 to the present day. 

The incumbent prime minister of Romania, as of , is Ion-Marcel Ciolacu, the current leader of the Social Democratic Party (PSD), who has been serving since 15 June 2023 onwards. 

Ciolacu has been leading a PSD-PNL grand coalition government, as part of and representing the ruling National Coalition for Romania (CNR), since mid June 2023 to the present day. The Ciolacu Cabinet is the second CNR government to date and the only one to be composed of only two major political parties, after the UDMR/RMDSZ was eliminated from the coalition and, consequently, entered in opposition. In addition, the share of governmental power between the two major political parties which constitute this CNR cabinet is equal (i.e. 11 ministries per each constituent political party). For some time however, the stability and cohesion of the incumbent cabinet are both quite debatable.

== Affiliations ==

The political stance of Romanian prime ministers prior to the development of a modern party system is given by the following affiliations in the table below:

The political stance of Romanian prime ministers after the development of a modern party system is given by the following affiliations in the table below:

In 1862, Prince Alexandru Ioan Cuza changed the Constitution and from then on there has been a single unified central government, permanently seated in Bucharest, the capital of Romania.

=== Kingdom of Romania (1881–1947) ===

=== Romanian People&#x27;s Republic/Socialist Republic of Romania (1947–1989) ===

<text>The dictyostelids (Dictyostelia/Dictyostelea, ICZN, Dictyosteliomycetes, ICBN) or cellular slime molds are a group of slime molds or social amoebae.

==Multicellular behavior==

When food (normally bacteria) is readily available dictyostelids behave as individual amoebae, which feed and divide normally. However, when the food supply is exhausted, they aggregate to form a multicellular assembly, called a pseudoplasmodium, grex, or slug (not to be confused with the gastropod mollusc called a slug). The grex has a definite anterior and posterior, responds to light and temperature gradients, and has the ability to migrate. Under the correct circumstances the grex matures forming a sorocarp (fruiting body) with a stalk supporting one or more sori (balls of spores). These spores are inactive cells protected by resistant cell walls, and become new amoebae once food is available.

In &quot;Acytostelium&quot;, the sorocarp is supported by a stalk composed of cellulose, but in other dictyostelids the stalk is composed of cells, sometimes taking up the majority of the original amoebae. With a few exceptions, these cells die during stalk formation, and there is a definite correspondence between parts of the grex and parts of the fruiting body. Aggregation of amoebae generally takes place in converging streams. The amoebae move using filose pseudopods, and are attracted to chemicals produced by other amoebae. In &quot;Dictyostelium discoideum&quot;, aggregation is signalled by cAMP, but others use different chemicals. In the species &quot;Dictyostelium purpureum&quot;, the grouping is by kinship, not just by proximity.

==Uses as model organism==
Dictyostelium has been used as a model organism in molecular biology and genetics, and is studied as an example of cell communication, differentiation, and programmed cell death. It is also an interesting example of the evolution of cooperation and cheating. A large body of research data concerning &quot;D. discoideum&quot; is available on-line at DictyBase.

==Mechanism of aggregation in &quot;Dictyostelium discoideum&quot;==

The mechanism behind the aggregation of the amoebae relies on cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) as a signal molecule. One cell, the founder of the colony, begins to secrete cAMP in response to stress. Others detect this signal, and respond in two ways:
*The amoeba moves towards the signal.
*The amoeba secretes more cAMP to boost the signal.
The effect of this is to relay the signal throughout the nearby population of amoebae and cause inward movement to the area of highest cAMP concentration.

Within an individual cell, the mechanism is as follows:
#cAMP reception at the cell membrane activates a G-protein
#G protein stimulates Adenylate cyclase
#cAMP diffuses out of cell into medium
#Internal cAMP inactivates the external cAMP receptor.
#A different g-protein stimulates Phospholipase C
#IP3 induces calcium ion release
#Calcium ions act on the cytoskeleton to induce the extension of pseudopodia.

Because the internal cAMP concentration inactivates the receptor for external cAMP, an individual cell shows oscillatory behaviour. This behaviour produces beautiful spirals seen in converging colonies and is reminiscent of the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction and two-dimensional cyclic cellular automata.

==Genome==
The entire genome of &quot;Dictyostelium discoideum&quot; was published in &quot;Nature&quot; in 2005 by geneticist Ludwig Eichinger and coworkers. The haploid genome contains approximately 12,500 genes on 6 chromosomes. For comparison, the diploid human genome has 20,000-25,000 genes (represented twice) on 23 chromosome pairs. There is a high level of the nucleotides adenosine and thymidine (~77%) leading to a codon usage that favors more adenosines and thymidines in the third position. Tandem repeats of trinucleotides are abundant in Dictyostelium, which in humans cause Trinucleotide repeat disorders.

==Sexual reproduction==
Sexual development can occur when amoeboid cells are starved for their bacterial food supply and dark humid conditions are present. Both heterothallic and homothallic strains of Dictostelium can undergo mating. Heterothallic sexual development has been most extensively studied in &quot;D. discoideum&quot;, and homothallic sexual development has been most well studied in &quot;D. mucoroides&quot;. Heterothallic matings are initiated by fusion of haploid cells (gametes) from two strains of opposite mating type. This contrasts with homothallic strains that appear to express both mating types.

Mating is initiated by gametogenesis that produces small, motile gametes that fuse to form a small binucleate cell. The volume of the binucleate cell then increases to produce a giant binuclear cell. As growth proceeds, the nuclei swell, and then fuse forming a true diploid zygote giant cell. As this is occurring, amoebae have been undergoing cAMP-induced chemotaxis towards the giant cell surface. This forms a cellular aggregate and at the center of the aggregate the zygote giant cell ingests the surrounding amoebae. Phagocytosis is followed by digestion of the ingested amoebae. Next the zygote forms a macrocyst characterized by a surrounding extracellular cellulose sheath. After the macrocyst is formed it ordinarily remains dormant for a period before germination can occur. Within the macrocyst the diploid zygote undergoes meiosis followed by successive mitotic divisions. When the macrocyst germinates it releases many haploid amoeboid cells.

==Taxonomy==

=== Classification history ===
The Dictyostelium phylogeny tree has undergone multiple changes in the past decades. The first dictyostelid to be described was &quot;Dictyostelium mucoroides&quot; in 1869 by Osker Brefeld, and the original discovery of &quot;Dictyostelium discoideum&quot; occurred in 1935, with further discoveries from Kenneth Raper, followed by global efforts led by James Cavender and collaborators. &quot;Dictyostelium discoideum&quot; was initially classified under ‘lower fungi,’ but the classification has since shifted the classification to under the Amoebozoa phylum where it is currently.

The groupings within the dictyostelid phylogeny tree has undergone frequent reordering due to availability new evidence. Most currently accepted phylogenies of dictyostelids utilize genome sequencing and small subunit ribosomal DNA (ssu-rDNA). The dictyostelids can be further subdivided into four groups. In particular, group 4 contains the &quot;Dictyostelium discoideum&quot; species and differs from the other groups with its usage of cAMP as an attractant emitted during aggregation.

=== Evolution ===
Fossil calibrations indicate that dictyostelids class originally diverged into two major branches approximately 0.52 billion years ago. Current theories speculate that dictyostelid stalk and spore formation originally evolved as an adaption to global glacial formations. Further subdivision of dictyostelids species likely arose as most glacial formations melted. Most species in major groups 1, 2, and 3 display an encystment ability that allows individuals to survive low temperatures, but spores have shown an increased ability in resisting lower temperatures. Group 4 differs from other major groups in a general lacking ability to encyst, but its spores have shown better resistances against lower temperatures relative to spores from other groups.

The internal phylogeny of the Dictyostelids is shown in the cladogram.

==Model host organism for &quot;Legionella&quot;==
&quot;Dictyostelium&quot; shares many molecular features with macrophages, the human host of &quot;Legionella&quot;. The cytoskeletal composition of &quot;D. discoideum&quot; is similar to that of mammalian cells as are the processes driven by these components, such as phagocytosis, membrane trafficking, endocytic transit and vesicle sorting. Like leukocytes, &quot;D. discoideum&quot; possess chemotactic capacity. Hence, &quot;D. discoideum&quot; represents a suitable model system to ascertain the influence of a variety of host cell factors during &quot;Legionella&quot; infections.

<text>Wireless transaction protocol (WTP) is a standard used in mobile telephony. It is a layer of the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) that is intended to bring Internet access to mobile phones. WTP provides functions similar to TCP, except that WTP has reduced amount of information needed for each transaction (e.g. does not include a provision for rearranging out-of-order packets). WTP runs on top of UDP and performs many of the same tasks as TCP but in a way optimized for wireless devices, which saves processing and memory cost as compared to TCP.

It supports 3 types of transaction:

<text>Sir Michael Terence Wogan (; 3 August 1938 – 31 January 2016) was an Irish–British radio and television broadcaster who worked for the BBC in the UK for most of his career. Between 1993 and his semi-retirement in December 2009, his BBC Radio 2 weekday breakfast programme &quot;Wake Up to Wogan&quot; regularly drew an estimated eight million listeners. He was believed to be the most listened-to radio broadcaster in Europe.

Wogan was a leading media personality in Ireland and Britain from the late 1960s and was often referred to as a &quot;national treasure&quot;. In addition to his weekday radio show, he was known for his work on television, including the BBC1 chat show &quot;Wogan&quot;, presenting &quot;Children in Need&quot;, the game show &quot;Blankety Blank&quot; and &quot;Come Dancing&quot;. He was the BBC&#x27;s commentator for the Eurovision Song Contest from 1971 to 2008 (radio: 1971, 1974–1977; television: 1973, 1978, 1980–2008) and the Contest&#x27;s co-host in . From 2010 to 2015 he presented &quot;Weekend Wogan&quot;, a two-hour Sunday morning show on Radio 2.

In 2005, Wogan acquired British citizenship in addition to his Irish nationality and was awarded a knighthood in the same year and was therefore entitled to use the title &quot;Sir&quot;. He died on 31 January 2016, aged 77.

Wogan was born on 3 August 1938 at Cleary&#x27;s Nursing Home, Elm Park, Limerick, Ireland, the elder of two children. He was the son of the manager of Leverett &amp; Frye, a high-class grocery store in Limerick, and was educated at Crescent College, a Jesuit school, from the age of eight. He experienced a strongly religious upbringing, later commenting that he had been brainwashed into believing by the threat of going to hell. Despite this, he often expressed his fondness for the city of his birth, commenting on one occasion that &quot;Limerick never left me, whatever it is, my identity is Limerick.&quot;

At the age of 15, after his father was promoted to general manager, Wogan moved to Dublin with his family. While living there he attended Crescent College&#x27;s sister school, Belvedere College. He participated in amateur dramatics and discovered a love of rock and roll. After leaving Belvedere in 1956, Wogan had a brief career in the banking profession, joining the Royal Bank of Ireland. Still in his twenties, he joined the national broadcaster of Ireland, Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ), as a newsreader and announcer, after seeing a newspaper advertisement inviting applicants.

==Radio work==

===Early career===
Wogan conducted interviews and presented documentary features during his first two years at Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ), before moving to the light entertainment department as a disc jockey and host of TV quiz and variety shows such as &quot;Jackpot&quot;, a top-rated quiz show on RTÉ in the 1960s. When the show was dropped by RTÉ TV in 1967, he approached the BBC for extra work. David Attenborough rebuffed his job application to be a BBC presenter; in 2016, after Wogan&#x27;s death, he expressed the view that &quot;to have had two Irishmen presenting on BBC2 would have looked ridiculous&quot;. Wogan began working for BBC Radio, initially &#x27;down the line&#x27; from Dublin, first broadcasting on the BBC Light Programme on 27 September 1966. He presented the Tuesday edition of &quot;Late Night Extra&quot; for two years on BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 2, commuting weekly from Dublin to London. After being a stand-in presenter on Jimmy Young&#x27;s mid-morning show while Young took a holiday throughout July 1969, Wogan was offered a weekday afternoon slot which began on 29 September that year, initially on BBC Radio 1, but from early 1970, was also simultaneously broadcast on BBC Radio 2.

In April 1972 he took over the breakfast show on BBC Radio 2, swapping places with John Dunn, who moved to the afternoon show. Wogan achieved record estimated audiences of up to 7.9 million. His first chat show, &quot;Wogan&#x27;s World&quot;, was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 from 6 June 1974 to 21 September 1975. His seemingly ubiquitous presence across the media meant that he frequently became the butt of jokes by comedians of the time, among them The Goodies and The Barron Knights. He released a parody vocal version of the song &quot;The Floral Dance&quot; in 1978, by popular request from listeners who enjoyed hearing him sing over the instrumental hit by the Brighouse and Rastrick Brass Band. His version reached number 21 in the UK Singles Chart. In December 1984, Wogan left his breakfast show to pursue a full-time career in television and was replaced by Ken Bruce.

===Return to radio===
In January 1993 he returned to Radio 2, replacing Brian Hayes to present the breakfast show, which took the new name &quot;Wake Up to Wogan&quot;; it began with a preview show in the mid-morning of Boxing Day 1992. Wogan&#x27;s tendency to go off on rambling, esoteric tangents, often including banter with his then producer Paul Walters, became popular with both younger and older listeners. Much of the entertainment came from letters and emails sent in by listeners, many of whom adopted punning pseudonyms. One occasion involved Wogan reading out an email from someone using the name &quot;Tess Tickles&quot;, without realising what the name was referring to, prompting Paul Walters&#x27; standard reply in such situations – &quot;I only print &#x27;em!&quot;

Through his show Wogan was also widely credited with launching the career of singer Katie Melua, after he repeatedly played her début single, &quot;The Closest Thing to Crazy&quot;, in late 2003. When she performed on &quot;Children in Need&quot; in 2005, Wogan joked that Melua owed her career to him. He gave credit for her discovery to Walters. Walters also put music by Eva Cassidy, an American singer who had died in relative obscurity, on Wogan&#x27;s playlist; Cassidy then, posthumously, became a sensation in the United Kingdom.

As his radio show was considered to attract older listeners, Wogan jokingly referred to his fans as &quot;TOGs&quot;, standing for &quot;Terry&#x27;s Old Geezers&quot; or &quot;Terry&#x27;s Old Gals&quot;, while &quot;TYGs&quot; were &quot;Terry&#x27;s Young Geezers/Gals&quot;, who he joked were forced to listen to him because of their parents&#x27; choice of radio station. Wogan was referred to as &quot;The Togmeister&quot; on his own programme by himself and members of his production team, and he referred to the podcast of his show as a &quot;Togcast&quot;.

There were also running jokes involving Wogan&#x27;s newsreader colleagues Alan Dedicoat (nicknamed &quot;Deadly&quot; after the spoonerism &quot;Deadly Alancoat&quot;), Fran Godfrey (nicknamed &quot;Frank&quot;), and John Marsh (nicknamed &quot;Boggy&quot;). Marsh once told Wogan on air that his wife was called Janet, and a series of &quot;Janet and John&quot; stories followed, read by Wogan during the breakfast show. These were a pastiche of children&#x27;s learn-to-read stories, with humorous sexual double entendres, which often led to Wogan and Marsh breaking into laughter. Six CDs and two books of the stories have been sold in aid of Children in Need, raising over £4 million. A long-running campaign by Wogan criticising the British government for levying VAT on the CDs eventually led to a government rebate of £200,000. Another feature of the programme was Wogan&#x27;s exchanges with &quot;the Totty from Splotty&quot; – Lynn Bowles, the Welsh traffic reporter from Splott, Cardiff – which often involved reading limericks from listeners cut short after one or two lines, as risqué innuendo in the later lines was telegraphed.

&quot;Wake Up to Wogan&quot; attracted an estimated audience of eight million in 2005. That figure was surpassed in 2008, as Wogan&#x27;s show held off a challenge from Radio 1 for listeners during the breakfast slot. According to figures leaked to British newspapers in April 2006, Wogan was the highest-paid BBC radio presenter at that time, with an £800,000-a-year salary. In an interview with Britain&#x27;s &quot;Hello!&quot; magazine in its 30 May 2006 issue, Wogan confirmed this, saying that he represented &quot;good value&quot;. On 23 May 2005, he crossed BBC strike picket lines to present his show.

Wogan was forced off the air on 16 February 2007, when steam from a nearby gym set off fire alarms. For 15 minutes an emergency tape played continuous music. On returning, Wogan read out several light-hearted comments from listeners, saying that they thought he had died with his sudden disappearance and the playing of such sentimental music. On 7 September 2009, Wogan confirmed to his listeners that he would be leaving the breakfast show at the end of the year, with Chris Evans taking over. &quot;The Times&quot; published an ode to Terry: &quot;Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone. Terry Wogan is abandoning his microphone&quot;, and novelist Allison Pearson commented: &quot;Heard the one about the Irishman who reminded the British of what they could be at their best? His name was Terry Wogan.&quot; Wogan presented his final Radio 2 breakfast show on 18 December 2009.

It was announced that Wogan would return to Radio 2, beginning on 14 February 2010, to host a live weekly two-hour Sunday show on the network, featuring live musical performance and guests, between 11.00 am and 1.00 pm. The show, titled &quot;Weekend Wogan&quot;, was hosted in front of a live audience in the Radio Theatre at Broadcasting House until the fourth series, where he returned to the studio.

Wogan continued to host the show until his final broadcast on Remembrance Sunday 2015, due to his declining health with cancer. It then continued with guest hosts until the end of that month, after which, regular cover show &quot;Madeley on Sunday&quot; presented by Richard Madeley filled the slot temporarily. Michael Ball then permanently took over the slot in April 2016.

==Television work==

===Eurovision Song Contest===
In 1971, and from 1974 until 1977, Wogan provided the BBC&#x27;s radio commentary for the Eurovision Song Contest. He became known for his television commentary, which he handled first in 1973, again in 1978, and then every year from 1980 until 2008. He co-hosted the 1998 contest with Ulrika Jonsson, in Birmingham&#x27;s National Indoor Arena on 9 May. Wogan was the third person in the contest&#x27;s history to combine the roles of presenter and commentator. When not on stage, he was in his private booth providing the necessary TV commentary to BBC viewers. From 1977 until 1996, Wogan hosted the UK selection show each year, returning to the job in 1998, and again from 2003 until 2008. In 1973, 1975, every year from 1977 until 1984, and again in 1994, Wogan also presented the UK &quot;Eurovision Song Contest Previews&quot; on BBC1.

Wogan&#x27;s often deadpan commentating style, which often involved humour at the expense of others, caused controversy: for example, when he referred to the hosts of the 2001 contest in Denmark, Søren Pilmark and Natasja Crone Back, as &quot;Doctor Death and the Tooth Fairy&quot;.

During the presentation of the Dutch televote in the Eurovision Song Contest 2006, Wogan called the Dutch televote presenter, Paul de Leeuw, an &quot;&quot;, as de Leeuw started to make ad lib comments, gave his mobile phone number, and generally hogged the limelight for some time before giving the Dutch votes. Chris Tarrant later praised Wogan&#x27;s acerbity.

During the 2007 BBC show &quot;Making Your Mind Up&quot;, in which the British public voted to decide their Eurovision entry, Wogan incorrectly announced that the runner-up Cyndi was the winner. The winner was the group Scooch; according to the BBC, Wogan was provided with the correct result during the live show.

In the 2008 contest, the UK&#x27;s entry, Andy Abraham, came last, much to Wogan&#x27;s disappointment. Wogan argued that Abraham gave a better performance than the entries from Spain and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Right before the Russian entry&#x27;s reprise, he said &quot;… and possibly goodbye, Europe.”

On 11 August 2008, Wogan said in an interview with the &quot;Radio Times&quot; magazine that he was doubtful about presenting the Eurovision Song Contest for the United Kingdom again. On 5 December 2008, Wogan stepped down from the role after 35 years. Graham Norton succeeded Wogan as BBC commentator from the 2009 contest onwards.

In November 2014, Wogan reviewed Norton&#x27;s autobiography for &quot;The Irish Times&quot;. Describing his attitude towards the contest, he wrote that he saw it as a &quot;sometimes foolish farce&quot;, while implying that the winner of the 2014 contest, Austrian drag performer Conchita Wurst, was a &quot;freakshow&quot;. After his death, his presentation of the contest was criticised for its mocking tone.

===Chat shows===
Wogan&#x27;s first foray into TV interviewing, and indeed to British television, was in 1972 on &quot;Lunchtime with Wogan&quot; on ITV. Later, &quot;What&#x27;s On, Wogan?&quot; ran for one series in 1980 on BBC1, primarily on early Saturday evenings. In 1981 he had a chance to host a one-off chat show, &quot;Saturday Live&quot;. Among his guests on this show were Larry Hagman, promoting the film &quot;S.O.B.&quot;, and Frank Hall. Hagman was at the height of his fame, which gave the show a high profile.

Soon after Wogan was given his own chat show, &quot;Wogan&quot;, which after a trial run on a midweek evening, was recommissioned for broadcast on Saturday nights from 1982 to 1984. Between 1985 and 1992, the show aired on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 7 pm. The series included interviews with George Best, Chevy Chase, Anne Bancroft, Ronnie Barker announcing his retirement on the show, and David Icke claiming to be the &quot;Son of God&quot;, to whom Wogan stated: &quot;They&#x27;re not laughing with you, they&#x27;re laughing at you.&quot;

The BBC stopped an interview in 1989 with Simon Hayward, a former captain in the Life Guards, hours before he was due to appear on the &quot;Wogan&quot; show. Hayward insisted that he was innocent of drug smuggling offences. The decision was taken by the Controller of BBC1, Jonathan Powell, after protests from several MPs. The BBC was accused of censorship, and a Conservative MP, John Gorst, described the decision to ban Hayward from &quot;Wogan&quot; as &quot;outrageous&quot;.

Wogan was released from his talk show contract in 1992, after pressure from the BBC. He said that the BBC also wanted his scheduling slot for the ill-fated soap &quot;Eldorado&quot;. After &quot;Eldorado&quot; took over the 7 pm slot, Wogan briefly hosted a new weekly chat strand &quot;Terry Wogan&#x27;s Friday Night&quot; in 1993, but this series was not recommissioned.

Wogan presented &quot;Wogan Now and Then&quot; (2006), a show in which he interviewed guests from his former chat show, as well as new guests. BBC Two launched a new compilation series, &quot;Wogan: the Best Of&quot; in 2015, featuring selected interview segments and music performances from Wogan&#x27;s past chat series, linked by new introductions from Wogan.

===Children in Need===
In 1980, the BBC&#x27;s charity appeal for children was first broadcast as a telethon called &quot;Children in Need&quot;, with Wogan presenting alongside Sue Lawley and Esther Rantzen. He campaigned extensively for the charity, and often involved himself via auctions on his radio show, or more directly by taking part in well-publicised sponsored activities.

He was reported to be the only celebrity paid for his participation in Children in Need, having received a fee every year since 1980 (£9,065 in 2005). Wogan stated that he would &quot;quite happily do it for nothing&quot; and that he &quot;never asked for a fee&quot;. Wogan donated his BBC fees to the charity. The BBC stated that the fee had &quot;never been negotiated&quot; and was paid from BBC resources rather than the Children in Need fund.

He appeared on the panel comedy show &quot;QI&quot; in the 2008 episode for Children in Need, &#x27;Families&#x27;.

In 2008, Wogan and singer Aled Jones released a single &quot;Little Drummer Boy&quot;/&quot;Peace on Earth&quot;, which got to number three in the UK music charts. The money raised went to BBC &quot;Children in Need&quot;. The two recorded a second Christmas single &quot;Silver Bells&quot; in 2009, which was also in aid of BBC Children in Need.

Wogan was the main regular presenter of &quot;Children in Need&quot; between 1980 and 2014. In November 2015, he was unable to participate in the live televised &quot;Children in Need&quot; appeal for the first time in its 35-year history due to poor health following a surgical procedure on his back. He did, however, make a brief appearance as part of a pre-recorded sketch. He was replaced by Dermot O&#x27;Leary. 

===Other television work===

Wogan&#x27;s television profile was boosted considerably when he became the first-ever host of &quot;Blankety Blank&quot; in 1979. His good-humoured interaction with the contestants and lively banter with the celebrity guests went a long way to making the show a success. Among the guests who appeared most frequently during this period were Roy Hudd, Beryl Reid, Lorraine Chase and Kenny Everett. Wogan left the show after the 1983 series, just over a year before his thrice-weekly chat show commenced.

Wogan narrated the BBC television series &quot;Stoppit and Tidyup&quot;, which was broadcast in 1987.

Wogan appeared on &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot; four times, between 2004 and 2009. In an appearance on the BBC programme &quot;Top Gear&quot;, Wogan became the second-slowest guest to go around the test track as the &quot;Star in a Reasonably-Priced Car&quot;, a Suzuki Liana. Only Richard Whiteley was slower.

In 2010, Wogan made a cameo appearance in the second series of &quot;Being Human&quot;, and also guest-hosted the fourth episode of the 24th series of &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot;. The following year, Wogan hosted &quot;Wogan on Wodehouse&quot; for BBC Two. In 2011 he appeared as a panellist on &quot;Would I Lie To You&quot;.

On 21 September 2013, Wogan appeared as a panellist on ITV game show &quot;Through the Keyhole&quot;. In November 2013, he participated in a celebrity edition of the BBC One game show &quot;Pointless&quot;, with celebrities including Bobby Ball and Esther Rantzen, in aid of Children in Need.

On 31 March 2014, Wogan was a guest reporter on &quot;Bang Goes the Theory&quot;, on which he discussed old-age dementia. From 12 to 16 May 2014, Wogan appeared on the Channel 4 game show &quot;Draw It!&quot;. On 10 November 2014, in the run-up to that year&#x27;s &quot;Children in Need&quot; telethon, Wogan guest hosted an episode of &quot;The One Show&quot; with Alex Jones. He also presented a series called &quot;Terry and Mason&#x27;s Great Food Trip&quot; with the cab driver Mason McQueen in 2015, in which the duo travelled across Britain eating regional food.

==Honours and awards==
Wogan was appointed an Honorary Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1997, and later became an Honorary Knight Commander of the same order (KBE) in the 2005 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours List. After asserting his right to British citizenship and retaining his Irish citizenship that year, Wogan was officially knighted on 11 October 2005, allowing him to be called &quot;Sir Terry&quot;. On 29 May 2007, he was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of Buckinghamshire.

On 15 June 2007, Wogan&#x27;s home city of Limerick honoured him with the Freedom of the City at a ceremony in Limerick&#x27;s Civic Hall. Because of his long absence from the city and unflattering remarks about the city in a 1980 interview, the local press carried out a vox pop, which resulted in support for the award. He was made an Honorary Freeman of the City of London in 2009, and invited to raise the bascules of Tower Bridge.

In 2004, he received an Honorary D.Litt. degree from the University of Limerick, as well as a special lifetime achievement award from his native city. He received an Honorary LL.D. degree from Leicester University in 2010.

In 1978, Wogan was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;, when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at Broadcasting House.

Wogan was inducted into the Radio Academy Hall of Fame at a gala dinner held in his honour on 10 December 2009. Wogan was announced as the Ultimate Icon of Radio 2, commemorating the station&#x27;s 40th birthday. The shortlist of sixteen candidates had been published on the BBC Radio 2 website, and the winner was announced live on Radio 2 during a one-off special edition of &quot;Family Favourites&quot; by host Michael Aspel on 30 September 2007. He praised his fellow nominees, the Beatles, Diana, Princess of Wales, and Nelson Mandela during his acceptance speech, which was broadcast live on BBC Radio 2, and he chose Nat King Cole&#x27;s recording of &quot;Stardust&quot; as his iconic song of the last 40 years. Wogan had chosen the song twice before as his favourite record on &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, and said he wanted to be buried with it.

==Personal life==
Wogan married Helen Joyce (1936–2024) on 24 April 1965 in her parish church, Our Lady of Refuge, Rathmines, and they remained married until his death in 2016. They lived in Taplow, Buckinghamshire, with another home in Gascony, south-west France. They had four children (one of whom, a daughter Vanessa, died when only a few weeks old) and five grandchildren. In 2010, Wogan described the anguish he felt on the loss of his baby daughter.

In April 2013, Wogan attended the funeral of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher after being invited by her family.

Wogan was brought up and educated as a Roman Catholic, but became an atheist at the age of 17. In an interview with Gay Byrne on RTÉ, he said that he respected those who had &quot;the gift of faith&quot;.

==Death==
Wogan&#x27;s health declined after Christmas 2015. He did not present &quot;Children in Need&quot; in November 2015, citing back pain as the reason for his absence from the long-running annual show. One of his friends, Father Brian D&#x27;Arcy, visited him in January 2016, and noticed he was seriously ill. Wogan died of cancer on 31 January 2016 at his home, at the age of 77.

British Prime Minister David Cameron said that &quot;Britain has lost a huge talent&quot;, and Michael D. Higgins, the President of Ireland, praised Wogan&#x27;s career and his frequent visits to his homeland. Taoiseach Enda Kenny and Tánaiste Joan Burton remembered Wogan for his role in helping Anglo-Irish relations during the Troubles. D&#x27;Arcy speculated that a public funeral would be logistically difficult, as there would be too many people wanting to pay their respects.

==Legacy==

After Wogan&#x27;s death and his private funeral a few weeks later, a public memorial service was held on 27 September the same year. This was held at Westminster Abbey, was opened by a recording of Wogan himself, and featured a number of his celebrity friends making speeches, such as Chris Evans and Joanna Lumley. The service was broadcast live on BBC Radio 2.

In February 2016, a memorial montage was aired as part of the United Kingdom&#x27;s selection show for the 2016 Eurovision Song contest, &quot;Eurovision: You Decide&quot;. During that year&#x27;s contest in Stockholm, Graham Norton asked UK viewers during his commentary to &quot;raise a glass&quot; for Wogan before the ninth song of the contest was performed; this honour has continued every year since.

In the run-up to the annual telethon for &quot;Children in Need&quot;, the BBC held a special concert at The Royal Albert Hall, named &quot;Children in Need Rocks (for Terry)&quot;. Unlike previous CiN Rock concerts, the acts performing were specially selected by the BBC and Wogan&#x27;s friends, as they were synonymous with his career. Performers included Katie Melua, whom he championed during his time as a DJ on Radio 2; Olly Murs, who performed Wogan&#x27;s favourite swing classics; Eva Cassidy, who posthumously performed over video tape with Shaun Escoffery duetting live in the studio on the song &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot;; and Michael Ball and Alfie Boe covering &quot;The Floral Dance&quot;, a song which Wogan once covered himself.

On 16 November 2016, the BBC renamed BBC Western House, home of Radio 2, in his memory, to BBC Wogan House.

<text>In placental mammals, the umbilical cord (also called the navel string, birth cord or funiculus umbilicalis) is a conduit between the developing embryo or fetus and the placenta. During prenatal development, the umbilical cord is physiologically and genetically part of the fetus and (in humans) normally contains two arteries (the umbilical arteries) and one vein (the umbilical vein), buried within Wharton&#x27;s jelly. The umbilical vein supplies the fetus with oxygenated, nutrient-rich blood from the placenta. Conversely, the fetal heart pumps low-oxygen, nutrient-depleted blood through the umbilical arteries back to the placenta.

==Structure and development==

The umbilical cord develops from and contains remnants of the yolk sac and allantois. It forms by the fifth week of development, replacing the yolk sac as the source of nutrients for the embryo. The cord is not directly connected to the mother&#x27;s circulatory system, but instead joins the placenta, which transfers materials to and from the maternal blood without allowing direct mixing. The length of the umbilical cord is approximately equal to the crown-rump length of the fetus throughout pregnancy. The umbilical cord in a full term neonate is usually about 50 centimeters (20 in) long and about 2 centimeters (0.75 in) in diameter. This diameter decreases rapidly within the placenta. The fully patent umbilical artery has two main layers: an outer layer consisting of circularly arranged smooth muscle cells and an inner layer which shows rather irregularly and loosely arranged cells embedded in abundant ground substance staining metachromatic. The smooth muscle cells of the layer are rather poorly differentiated, contain only a few tiny myofilaments and are thereby unlikely to contribute actively to the process of post-natal closure.

Umbilical cord can be detected on ultrasound by six weeks of gestation and well-visualised by eight to nine weeks of gestation.

The umbilical cord lining is a good source of mesenchymal and epithelial stem cells. Umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSC) have been used clinically to treat osteoarthritis, autoimmune diseases, and multiple other conditions. Their advantages include a better harvesting, and multiplication, and immunosuppressive properties that define their potential for use in transplantations. Their use would also overcome the ethical objections raised by the use of embryonic stem cells.

The umbilical cord contains Wharton&#x27;s jelly, a gelatinous substance made largely from mucopolysaccharides that protects the blood vessels inside. It contains one vein, which carries oxygenated, nutrient-rich blood to the fetus, and two arteries that carry deoxygenated, nutrient-depleted blood away. Occasionally, only two vessels (one vein and one artery) are present in the umbilical cord. This is sometimes related to fetal abnormalities, but it may also occur without accompanying problems.

It is unusual for a vein to carry oxygenated blood and for arteries to carry deoxygenated blood (the only other examples being the pulmonary veins and arteries, connecting the lungs to the heart). However, this naming convention reflects the fact that the umbilical vein carries blood towards the fetus&#x27; heart, while the umbilical arteries carry blood away.

The blood flow through the umbilical cord is approximately 35 ml / min at 20 weeks, and 240 ml / min at 40 weeks of gestation. Adapted to the weight of the fetus, this corresponds to 115 ml / min / kg at 20 weeks and 64 ml / min / kg at 40 weeks.

For terms of location, the &quot;proximal&quot; part of an umbilical cord refers to the segment closest to the embryo or fetus in embryology and fetal medicine, and closest to the placenta in placental pathology, and opposite for the &quot;distal&quot; part, respectively.

==Function==
===Connection to fetal circulatory system===
The umbilical cord enters the fetus via the abdomen, at the point which (after separation) will become the umbilicus (belly button or navel). Within the fetus, the umbilical vein continues towards the transverse fissure of the liver, where it splits into two. One of these branches joins with the hepatic portal vein (connecting to its left branch), which carries blood into the liver. The second branch (known as the ductus venosus) bypasses the liver and flows into the inferior vena cava, which carries blood towards the heart. The two umbilical arteries branch from the internal iliac arteries and pass on either side of the urinary bladder into the umbilical cord, completing the circuit back to the placenta.

===Changes after birth===
After birth, the umbilical cord stump will dry up and drop away by the time the baby is three weeks old. If the stump still has not separated after three weeks, it might be a sign of an underlying problem, such as an infection or immune system disorder.

In absence of external interventions, the umbilical cord occludes physiologically shortly after birth, explained both by a swelling and collapse of Wharton&#x27;s jelly in response to a reduction in temperature and by vasoconstriction of the blood vessels by smooth muscle contraction. In effect, a natural clamp is created, halting the flow of blood. In air at 18 °C, this physiological clamping will take three minutes or less. In water birth, where the water temperature is close to body temperature, normal pulsation can be five minutes and longer.

Closure of the umbilical artery by vasoconstriction consists of multiple constrictions which increase in number and degree with time. There are segments of dilations with trapped uncoagulated blood between the constrictions before complete occlusion. Both the partial constrictions and the ultimate closure are mainly produced by muscle cells of the outer circular layer. In contrast, the inner layer seems to serve mainly as a plastic tissue which can easily be shifted in an axial direction and then folded into the narrowing lumen to complete the closure. The vasoconstrictive occlusion appears to be mainly mediated by serotonin and thromboxane A2. The artery in cords of preterm infants contracts more to angiotensin II and arachidonic acid and is more sensitive to oxytocin than in term ones. In contrast to the contribution of Wharton&#x27;s jelly, cooling causes only temporary vasoconstriction.

Within the child, the umbilical vein and ductus venosus close up, and degenerate into fibrous remnants known as the round ligament of the liver and the ligamentum venosum respectively. Part of each umbilical artery closes up (degenerating into what are known as the medial umbilical ligaments), while the remaining sections are retained as part of the circulatory system.

==Clinical significance==
===Problems and abnormalities===
A number of abnormalities can affect the umbilical cord, which can cause problems that affect both mother and child:
* Umbilical cord compression can result from, for example, entanglement of the cord, a knot in the cord, or a nuchal cord, (which is the wrapping of the umbilical cord around the fetal neck) but these conditions do not always cause obstruction of fetal circulation.
* Velamentous cord insertion
* Single umbilical artery
* Umbilical cord prolapse
* Vasa praevia

===Clamping and cutting===

The cord can be clamped at different times; however, delaying the clamping of the umbilical cord until at least one minute after birth improves outcomes as long as there is the ability to treat the small risk of jaundice if it occurs. Clamping is followed by cutting of the cord, which is painless due to the absence of nerves. The cord is extremely tough, like thick sinew, and so cutting it requires a suitably sharp instrument. While umbilical severance may be delayed until after the cord has stopped pulsing (one to three minutes after birth), there is ordinarily no significant loss of either venous or arterial blood while cutting the cord. Current evidence neither supports, nor refutes, delayed cutting of the cord, according to the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guidelines.

There are umbilical cord clamps which incorporate a knife. These clamps are safer and faster, allowing one to first apply the cord clamp and then cut the umbilical cord. After the cord is clamped and cut, the newborn wears a plastic clip on the navel area until the compressed region of the cord has dried and sealed sufficiently.

The length of umbilical left attached to the newborn varies by practice; in most hospital settings the length of cord left attached after clamping and cutting is minimal. In the United States, however, where the birth occurred outside of the hospital and an emergency medical technician (EMT) clamps and cuts the cord, a longer segment up to in length is left attached to the newborn.

The remaining umbilical stub remains for up to ten days as it dries and then falls off.

====Early versus delayed clamping====
A Cochrane review in 2013 came to the conclusion that delayed cord clamping (between one and three minutes after birth) is &quot;likely to be beneficial as long as access to treatment for jaundice requiring phototherapy is available&quot;. In this review delayed clamping, as contrasted to early, resulted in no difference in risk of severe maternal postpartum hemorrhage or neonatal mortality, and a low Apgar score. On the other hand, delayed clamping resulted in an increased birth weight of on average about 100 g, and an increased hemoglobin concentration of on average 1.5 g/dL with half the risk of being iron deficient at three and six months, but an increased risk of jaundice requiring phototherapy.

In 2012, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists officially endorsed delaying clamping of the umbilical cord for 30–60 seconds with the newborn held below the level of the placenta in all cases of preterm delivery based largely on evidence that it reduces the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage in these children by 50%. In the same committee statement, ACOG also recognize several other likely benefits for preterm infants, including &quot;improved transitional circulation, better establishment of red blood cell volume, and decreased need for blood transfusion&quot;. In January 2017, a revised Committee Opinion extended the recommendation to term infants, citing data that term infants benefit from increased hemoglobin levels in the newborn period and improved iron stores in the first months of life, which may result in improved developmental outcomes. ACOG recognized a small increase in the incidence of jaundice in term infants with delayed cord clamping, and recommended policies be in place to monitor for and treat neonatal jaundice. ACOG also noted that delayed cord clamping is not associated with increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage.

Several studies have shown benefits of delayed cord clamping: A meta-analysis showed that delaying clamping of the umbilical cord in full-term neonates for a minimum of two minutes following birth is beneficial to the newborn in giving improved hematocrit, iron status as measured by ferritin concentration and stored iron, as well as a reduction in the risk of anemia (relative risk, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.40–0.70). A decrease was also found in a study from 2008. Although there is higher hemoglobin level at 2 months, this effect did not persist beyond 6 months of age. Not clamping the cord for three minutes following the birth of a baby improved outcomes at four years of age. A delay of three minutes or more in umbilical cord clamping after birth reduce the prevalence of anemia in infants.

Negative effects of delayed cord clamping include an increased risk of polycythemia. Still, this condition appeared to be benign in studies. Infants whose cord clamping occurred later than 60 seconds after birth had a higher rate of neonatal jaundice requiring phototherapy.

Delayed clamping is not recommended as a response to cases where the newborn is not breathing well and needs resuscitation. Rather, the recommendation is instead to immediately clamp and cut the cord and perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The umbilical cord pulsating is not a guarantee that the baby is receiving enough oxygen.

====Umbilical nonseverance====
Some parents choose to omit cord severance entirely, a practice called &quot;lotus birth&quot; or umbilical nonseverance. The entire intact umbilical cord is allowed to dry and separates on its own (typically on the 3rd day after birth), falling off and leaving a healed umbilicus. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has warned about the risks of infection as the decomposing placenta tissue becomes a nest for infectious bacteria such as Staphylococcus. In one such case, a 20-hour old baby whose parents chose UCNS was brought to the hospital in an agonal state, was diagnosed with sepsis and required an antibiotic treatment for six weeks.

====Umbilical cord catheterization====
As the umbilical vein is directly connected to the central circulation, it can be used as a route for placement of a venous catheter for infusion and medication. The umbilical vein catheter is a reliable alternative to percutaneous peripheral or central venous catheters or intraosseous canulas and may be employed in resuscitation or intensive care of the newborn.

====Blood sampling====
From 24 to 34 weeks of gestation, when the fetus is typically viable, blood can be taken from the cord in order to test for abnormalities (particularly for hereditary conditions). This diagnostic genetic test procedure is known as percutaneous umbilical cord blood sampling.

===Storage of cord blood===
The blood within the umbilical cord, known as cord blood, is a rich and readily available source of primitive, undifferentiated stem cells (of type CD34-positive and CD38-negative). These cord blood cells can be used for bone marrow transplant.

Some parents choose to have this blood diverted from the baby&#x27;s umbilical blood transfer through early cord clamping and cutting, to freeze for long-term storage at a cord blood bank should the child ever require the cord blood stem cells (for example, to replace bone marrow destroyed when treating leukemia). This practice is controversial, with critics asserting that early cord blood withdrawal at the time of birth actually increases the likelihood of childhood disease, due to the high volume of blood taken (an average of 108ml) in relation to the baby&#x27;s total supply (typically 300ml). The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists stated in 2006 that &quot;there is still insufficient evidence to recommend directed commercial cord blood collection and stem-cell storage in low-risk families&quot;.

The American Academy of Pediatrics has stated that cord blood banking for self-use should be discouraged (as most conditions requiring the use of stem cells will already exist in the cord blood), while banking for general use should be encouraged. In the future, cord blood-derived embryonic-like stem cells (CBEs) may be banked and matched with other patients, much like blood and transplanted tissues. The use of CBEs could potentially eliminate the ethical difficulties associated with embryonic stem cells (ESCs).

While the American Academy of Pediatrics discourages private banking except in the case of existing medical need, it also says that information about the potential benefits and limitations of cord blood banking and transplantation should be provided so that parents can make an informed decision.

In the United States, cord blood education has been supported by legislators at the federal and state levels. In 2005, the National Academy of Sciences published an Institute of Medicine (IoM) report which recommended that expectant parents be given a balanced perspective on their options for cord blood banking. In response to their constituents, state legislators across the country are introducing legislation intended to help inform physicians and expectant parents on the options for donating, discarding or banking lifesaving newborn stem cells. Currently 17 states, representing two-thirds of U.S. births, have enacted legislation recommended by the IoM guidelines.

The use of cord blood stem cells in treating conditions such as brain injury and Type 1 Diabetes is already being studied in humans, and earlier stage research is being conducted for treatments of stroke, and hearing loss.

Cord blood stored with private banks is typically reserved for use of the donor child only. In contrast, cord blood stored in public banks is accessible to anyone with a closely matching tissue type and demonstrated need. The use of cord blood from public banks is increasing. Currently it is used in place of a bone marrow transplant in the treatment of blood disorders such as leukemia, with donations released for transplant through one registry, Netcord.org, passing 1,000,000 as of January 2013. Cord blood is used when the patient cannot find a matching bone marrow donor; this &quot;extension&quot; of the donor pool has driven the expansion of public banks.

==The umbilical cord in other animals==
The umbilical cord in some mammals, including cattle and sheep, contains two distinct umbilical veins. There is only one umbilical vein in the human umbilical cord.

In some animals, the mother will gnaw through the cord, thus separating the placenta from the offspring. The cord along with the placenta is often eaten by the mother, to provide nourishment and to dispose of tissues that would otherwise attract scavengers or predators. In chimpanzees, the mother leaves the cord in place and nurses her young with the cord and placenta attached until the cord dries out and separates naturally, within a day of birth, at which time the cord is discarded. (This was first documented by zoologists in the wild in 1974.)

Some species of shark—hammerheads, requiems and smooth-hounds—are viviparous and have an umbilical cord attached to their placenta.

==Other uses for the term &quot;umbilical cord&quot;==
The term &quot;umbilical cord&quot; or just &quot;umbilical&quot; has also come to be used for other cords with similar functions, such as the hose connecting surface-supplied divers to their surface supply of air and/or heating, or space-suited astronauts to their spacecraft. Engineers sometimes use the term to describe a complex or critical cable connecting a component, especially when composed of bundles of conductors of different colors, thickness and types, terminating in a single multi-contact disconnect.

==Cancer-causing toxicants in human umbilical cords==
In multiple American and international studies, cancer-causing chemicals have been found in the blood of umbilical cords. These originate from certain plastics, computer circuit boards, fumes and synthetic fragrances among others. Over 300 chemical toxicants have been found, including bisphenol A (BPA), tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), Teflon-related perfluorooctanoic acid, galaxolide and synthetic musks among others. The studies in America showed higher levels in African Americans, Hispanic Americans and Asian Americans due, it is thought, to living in areas of higher pollution.

<text>USS &quot;Duluth&quot; (LPD-6), an , was the second ship of the United States Navy named for the city in Minnesota.

&quot;Duluth&quot; was laid down on 18 December 1963 by the New York Naval Shipyard. She was launched on 14 August 1965 and commissioned on 18 December 1965. She was the last ship to be launched from the Brooklyn Navy Yard before it was closed.

==History==

===1965–1970===
The ship left New York Naval Shipyard, Brooklyn, in April 1966 for the US Naval Shipyard Philadelphia for final fitting out and preparation for refresher training and transit to its Home Port of US Naval Station San Diego, California. On 15 June 1966, a Sikorsky H-34 from HC-4 made the first helicopter landing on board. &quot;Duluth&quot; arrived via the Panama Canal in San Diego in September 1966. In April 1967 ship sailed via Hawaii and Australia to join the Amphibious Ready Group, U.S. 7th Fleet in the Vietnam War.

In 1967, from the months of May until November &quot;Duluth&quot; operated with Amphibious Ready Group, Seventh Fleet, in South China Sea. Conducted amphibious landing operations Bear Claw and Beacon Guide at Huế (7 June), Chu Lai (12 June), Cửa Việt Base (3, 27 July) and Phú Lộc (21 July). Took part in Operations Beacon Gate at Song Cua Dai and Chu Lai ( 7–16 August) and Beacon Point off Thừa Thiên Province. The LPD then steamed off Quảng Nam and Quảng Tín Provinces during Operation Ballistic Charge (16–28 September). After refitting at U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay, &quot;Duluth&quot; participated in helicopter-centered Operation Bastion Hill near Cửa Việt (10 October – 1 November). Following vehicle ferry operations from Subic early in the month, the LPD steamed to Hong Kong, arriving there 17 November.

Underway for a WestPac cruise on 1 May 1970, &quot;Duluth&quot; loaded BLT 1st Battalion, 9th Marines at Okinawa for transfer to Subic Bay at the end of the month. She then made several cargo lifts to Da Nang or to Yankee Station, delivering an H-3 helicopter to , spare parts, and carried YFU-52 back to Subic Bay before steaming to United States Fleet Activities Sasebo, Japan, for rest and recreation 3–15 July. Returning to Subic on 19 July, she spent the next three months conducting amphibious training and logistics operations from Subic to Da Nang and Vũng Tàu. In mid-October, &quot;Duluth&quot; embarked 140 Philippine marines for a joint exercise near Manila, but disaster recovery efforts in the wake of Typhoon Joan forced a cancellation of the operation. Arriving in Lagoney Gulf on 22 October, &quot;Duluth&quot; operated as a fuel stop and ready deck ship for helicopters during three days of relief operations in a swath of devastated barrios and villages 80 by wide and including the cities of Virac and Naga. Following another month of logistics support out of Subic Bay, &quot;Duluth&quot; steamed for home, reaching San Diego on 10 December.

===1971–1975===
After a restricted availability to repair a damaged rotor blade in her port turbine, &quot;Duluth&quot; sailed for another WestPac deployment on 1 October 1971. The ship loaded elements of BLT 2nd Battalion, 4th Marines at Okinawa on 18 October before resuming Da Nang logistics support operations out of Subic Bay. The LPD delivered vehicles, equipment and humanitarian supplies to Da Nang and embarked deck cargo and damaged PTFs for return to Subic. The LPD remained there until through the winter, conducting the occasional amphibious exercise in the Philippines and transporting troops and supplies between Subic Bay and Buckner Bay. On 1 April, following the outbreak of the North Vietnamese Easter Offensive, &quot;Duluth&quot; sailed to a holding station off South Vietnam to await developments. With the North Vietnamese offensive blunted by the end of the month, the LPD steamed to Subic Bay for rest and relaxation, 8–21 May. Returning to Vietnam, &quot;Duluth&quot; embarked 300 South Vietnamese marines at Tan My and landed them in Quảng Trị Province on the 24th, during which operation &quot;Duluth&quot; took desultory enemy fire from a shore battery. The LPD conducted a similar mission in early July, when Marine helicopters deployed South Vietnamese marines during Operation Lam-Son 72, before sailing for home on 14 July and arriving in San Diego on 4 August 1972.

On 28 March 1975, &quot;Duluth&quot; got underway for a WestPac deployment via Pearl Harbor, Okinawa and Subic Bay. Arriving off Vũng Tàu on 21 April, &quot;Duluth&quot; participated in Operation Frequent Wind, the evacuation of Saigon, Vietnam. On 29 April, fourteen South Vietnamese, Marine and Air America helicopters landed delivering over 900 refugees to &quot;Duluth&quot; alone, including the Italian ambassador. The refugees were later transferred to . The following day another 1,391 refugees arrived, forcing &quot;Duluth&quot;″s crew to jettison three Republic of Vietnam Air Force helicopters over the side to make room for the arriving CH-53 helicopters. The ship then steamed to Subic Bay and disembarked the refugees on 5 May. Over the next four days, working parties of volunteers reported to Grande Island to assist and process refugees. The LPD was reassigned to the task force heading to Cambodia to participate in the rescue operation of SS &quot;Mayaguez&quot;. &quot;Duluth&quot; was approaching her mission when the rescue operation was cancelled before the second wave could strike. They steamed back to Subic Bay to continue with assisting and processing of the South Vietnamese refugees.

===1982===
In March, &quot;Duluth&quot; participated as one of many amphibious ships in Operation Team Spirit &#x27;82. This was a joint training exercise between the U.S. Navy/U.S. Marine Corps and the forces of South Korea. Her specific mission was to transport the 1st Battalion, 1st Marines from Okinawa to South Korea and back. There was also a training evolution in support of a U.S. Marine Corps AV-8 Harrier unit. This involved landing and refueling some of the jets on the flight deck. During the transit to South Korea, &quot;Duluth&quot; was over flown by a Soviet Tu-95 Bear while in international waters.

===1981===
&quot;Duluth&quot; sailed on 12 November 1981 for a Westpac/Indian Ocean deployment as part of Amphibious Ready Group Alpha/Amphibious Squadron One (, , and MAU 31st/HMM-265 &#x27;Flying Tigers&#x27; (REIN)) during which USS &quot;Duluth&quot; and Amphibious Squadron One visited Fremantle, Western Australia for R&amp;R from 28 January to 3 February 1982. USS &quot;Duluth&quot; returned home on 15 May 1982

===1983===
In August, September and October 1983 &quot;Duluth&quot; served in support of the multi-national peace keeping mission to Beirut, Lebanon, and participated in the evacuation of Ambassador Robert Collins and family.

===1987===
In June &quot;Duluth&quot; embarked 1st Battalion 9th Marines, from Camp Pendleton, California, as Battalion Landing Team One Slant Nine and set out on its six-month WestPac tour. The official deployment was designated as the 13th MAU SOC (Marine Amphibious Unit, Special Operations Capable). Included in this deployment were , , and . Aboard &quot;Germantown&quot;, LCAC&#x27;s (Landing Craft Air Cushion) 2, 3 and 4 were carried. It was the first time that the LCACs were deployed in support of Naval and Marine Corps operations. Several Humanitarian missions were executed in the Philippines and Indonesia. Marines were also deployed to the Mediterranean to assault several terrorist-held oil rigs. The Marines were also called upon to restore order and security around the Subic Naval Base after several &quot;Sparrow teams&quot; killed high ranking government officials in an attempted coup. The ship received a Battle &quot;E&quot; and the Marines a Meritorious Unit Citation for actions throughout the deployment.

===1989–1994===
In January 1989 &quot;Duluth&quot; sailed on a WestPac cruise with MSSG-13 and SEAL Team 5 embarked. In addition to port calls in Okinawa, the Philippines, Japan and Hong Kong, &quot;Duluth&quot; participated in Team Spirit 89 in Korea. In late May after operations with the Australian Army and Navy, &quot;Duluth&quot;″s port call in Mackay, Australia was cut short when the Amphibious Ready Group she was attached to was recalled &quot;at best possible speed&quot; across the Pacific to the evolving situation in Panama. She returned to San Diego in early June. In August 1989, &quot;Duluth&quot; sailed to Prince William Sound, Alaska, for oil spill decontamination operations with HMM-268 embarked. &quot;Duluth&quot; housed clean-up crews, provided medical and weather forecasting services and supported decontamination barge efforts.

&quot;Duluth&quot; was underway 21 January 1994 for WestPac operations. Arrived in Singapore 14 February and assigned to TG 76.5 for duty off the coast of Somalia. The ship remained in Singapore for six days before getting underway for the Indian Ocean and arriving off Mogadishu on 3 March to assist in the evacuation of American forces from Somalia. She remained there, other than a short trip to Melindi, Kenya, until 24 April when the LPD steamed to Mombasa. &quot;Duluth&quot; then steamed off Kipini, Kenya, holding for possible contingency operations owing to the civil war in Rwanda, until 4 June when she sailed for Fremantle, Western Australia. Following a five-day port visit, the LPD returned to San Diego via Pearl Harbor, arriving home on 21 July.

===1996–1997===

During the deployment, &quot;Duluth&quot; participated with the other ships of COMPHIBRON Three and 13th MEU in a highly classified operation to capture Imad Mughniyah. This plan, Operation Return Ox, set sail at 1730C from Bahrain on 23 July 1996 to intercept the motor vessel &quot;Ibn Tufail&quot;, a Pakistani ship on which it was believed Mughniyah was embarked. On 24 July, after all ships were at sea and Navy SEALs had already begun shadowing the Pakistani ship, it was canceled. Operators were told that the White House canceled the interception when they could not be given 100% assurance that Mughniya was actually on board.

===2000–2005===

&quot;Duluth&quot; was again underway 14 August 2000 for operations in the Indian Ocean as part of the Amphibious Ready Group (ARG). Following stops at Pearl Harbor and Darwin, Australia, &quot;Duluth&quot; conducted three days of humanitarian assistance operations off East Timor ( 14–16 September) before a one-day stop at Singapore on 21 September. Moving into the Indian Ocean, the ARG stopped at Phuket, Thailand (28 September – 1 October) before steaming on to the Seychelles, where they arrived 9 October. Three days later, &quot;Duluth&quot; received word that had been bombed in harbor at Aden, Yemen, and the LPD quickly steamed north to Aden to provide small boat and helicopter operations in support of &quot;Cole&quot;. Following a short cruise north to Bahrain in late December, &quot;Duluth&quot; sailed east, arriving in San Diego on 14 February. While en route, the LPD stopped at Iwo Jima to launch amphibious vehicles in commemoration of the World War II battle.

Underway for Operation Iraqi Freedom on 6 January 2003, &quot;Duluth&quot; loaded elements of the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit and HMM-161 and sailed west. After a brief stop in Singapore on 29 January, the ships sailed into the Indian Ocean and arrived in the northern Persian Gulf on 10 February. The LPD operated at sea until 19 March when hostilities began in Iraq. The ship served as on-scene commander on 22 March when two helicopters from collided in the vicinity of &quot;Duluth&quot;. After the initial surge of Marines ashore, &quot;Duluth&quot;″s crew conducted boat operations in support of operations around Iraqi oil pipeline terminals. Departing the Persian Gulf on 27 May, the ship stopped at Cairns, Australia and Pearl Harbor before arriving home on 23 July.

While anchored at Guam on 28 December 2004, the LPD was ordered south for Operation Unified Assistance to aid victims of the devastating Indian Ocean tsunami. &quot;Duluth&quot; arrived off Sri Lanka on 9 January 2005 and her crew and embarked Marines cleared helicopter landing zones, removed debris and helped clean up two devastated elementary schools. During this deployment, &quot;Duluth&quot; delivered 210 tons of supplies to Sumatra and Sri Lanka.

The amphibious transport dock ship&#x27;s last deployment ended in June 2005 after a six-month cruise to the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.

Shortly after &quot;Duluth&quot;″s final cruise, she was decommissioned at Naval Station San Diego in a ceremony on 28 September 2005 and LPD-6 was stripped from the national ship&#x27;s registry. The ceremony featured the crew leaving the ship in ranks and the lowering of the national colors.

&quot;Duluth&quot; sat in San Diego for many months before being towed to the mothball fleet in Hawaii.
She was towed to Brownsville, Texas, in January 2014 for disposal. A team of former crew members, including two former commanding officers, boarded the ship prior to scrapping for final photographs and collection of mementos. The items removed are now in Duluth, Minnesota, at a museum. One of the anchors is also on display in Duluth.

==Awards==
&quot;Duluth&quot; won many awards in its 39 years. The most recent was the Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Award for supporting Coast Guard Port Security Units during Operation Iraqi Freedom from March to May 2003. Two Coast Guard units, PSUs 311 and 313, were assigned to defend the ABOT and KAAOT gas oil platforms (OPLATS) off the Iraqi coast after their seizure during the opening nights of Operation Iraqi Freedom. &quot;Duluth&quot; provided the Coast Guard detachments support by performing significant repairs to platform power sources, quality of life upgrades, command and control system repairs and improvements. More recently &quot;Duluth&quot; was awarded the Humanitarian Service Medal for tsunami relief efforts in the Sri Lanka area.

<doc id="233257" wikidata="Q2528140" url="?curid=233257" title="Viral load">
<text>Viral load, also known as viral burden, is a numerical expression of the quantity of virus in a given volume of fluid, including biological and environmental specimens. It is not to be confused with viral titre or viral titer, which depends on the assay. When an assay for measuring the infective virus particle is done (Plaque assay, Focus assay), viral titre often refers to the &quot;concentration&quot; of infectious viral particles, which is different from the &quot;total&quot; viral particles. Viral load is measured using body fluids sputum and blood plasma. As an example of environmental specimens, the viral load of norovirus can be determined from run-off water on garden produce. Norovirus has not only prolonged viral shedding and has the ability to survive in the environment but a minuscule infectious dose is required to produce infection in humans: less than 100 viral particles.

Viral load is often expressed as viral particles, (virions) or infectious particles per mL depending on the type of assay. A higher viral burden, titre, or viral load often correlates with the severity of an active viral infection. The quantity of virus per mL can be calculated by estimating the live amount of virus in an involved fluid. For example, it can be given in RNA copies per millilitre of blood plasma.

Tracking viral load is used to monitor therapy during chronic viral infections, and in immunocompromised patients such as those recovering from bone marrow or solid organ transplantation. Currently, routine testing is available for HIV-1, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus. Viral load monitoring for HIV is of particular interest in the treatment of people with HIV, as this is continually discussed in the context of management of HIV/AIDS. An undetectable viral load does not implicate a lack of infection. HIV positive patients on long-term combination antiretroviral therapy may present with an undetectable viral load on most clinical assays since the concentration of virus particles is below the limit of detection (LOD).

==Technologies for viral load testing==

A 2010 review study by Puren &quot;et al.&quot; categorizes viral load testing into three types: (1) nucleic acid amplification based tests (NATs or NAATs) commercially available in the United States with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, or on the market in the European Economic Area (EEA) with the CE marking; (2) &quot;Home–brew&quot; or in-house NATs; (3) non-nucleic acid-based test.

===Nucleic acid-based tests (NATs)===

There are many different molecular based test methods for quantifying the viral load using NATs. The starting material for amplification can be used to divide these molecular methods into three groups:
# Target amplification which uses the nucleic acid itself. Just a few of the more common methods
#* The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method of in vitro DNA synthesis uses a DNA template, polymerase, buffers, primers, and nucleotides to multiply the HIV in the blood sample. Then a chemical reaction marks the virus. The markers are measured and used to calculate the amount of virus. PCR is used to quantify integrated DNA.
#* Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a variation of PCR that can be used to quantify viral RNA. RNA is used as the starting material for this method and converted to double-stranded DNA, using the enzyme reverse transcriptase (RT) for PCR.
#* The nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) method is a transcription-based amplification system (TAS) variation of PCR. RNA is used as the target and a DNA copy is made. The DNA copy is then transcribed into RNA and amplified. Several TAS commercial variations are available including; transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), and self-sustaining sequence replication (3SR).
# Probe specific amplification uses synthetic probes that preferentially bind to a target sequence. The probes are then amplified
# Signal amplification uses large amounts of signal bound to an unamplified target originally present in the sample. One commonly used method:
#* The branched DNA (bDNA) method can use either DNA or RNA as the target nucleic acid. Short probes attached to a solid support and capture the target nucleic acid. Additional extender probes also bind to the target nucleic acid and to numerous reporter molecules which are used to increase the signal intensity, which is converted to a viral count.

==Plasma specimens==
EDTA Plasma, from and EDTA blood sample is a good source of cell-free viral RNA for RNA-based viral load testing. Extraction of RNA from plasma requires specialized equipment, reagents and training, which might out of reach for medium to small laboratories. A large sample (&gt; 1 mL of plasma) is needed requiring venipuncture.
===Storage===
EDTA blood can be stored at room temperature for 30 hours, and separated plasma for extended periods of time at -70 °C without significant decreases in viral load. 

===Measuring===
Viral load is reported as copies of HIV RNA in a millilitre (mL) of blood. Changes in viral load are usually reported as a log change (in powers of 10). For example, a three log increase in viral load (3 log10) is an increase of 103 or 1,000 times the previously reported level, while a drop from 500,000 to 500 copies would be a three-log-drop (also 3 log10).

===Other factors that affect viral load===
Different test methods often give different results for the same patient sample. To be comparable the same test method (target amplification, probe specific amplification, or signal amplification) should be used each time a patient specimen is run. Ideally patient testing should be conducted at the same medical laboratory, using the same viral load test and analyzer.

<doc id="233258" wikidata="Q253407" url="?curid=233258" title="Donna Haraway">
<text>Donna Jeanne Haraway (born September 6, 1944) is an American professor emerita in the history of consciousness and feminist studies departments at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and a prominent scholar in the field of science and technology studies. She has also contributed to the intersection of information technology and feminist theory, and is a leading scholar in contemporary ecofeminism. Her work criticizes anthropocentrism, emphasizes the self-organizing powers of nonhuman processes, and explores dissonant relations between those processes and cultural practices, rethinking sources of ethics.

Haraway has taught women&#x27;s studies and the history of science at the University of Hawaii (1971–1974) and Johns Hopkins University (1974–1980). She began working as a professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz in 1980 where she became the first tenured professor in feminist theory in the United States. Haraway&#x27;s works have contributed to the study of both human–machine and human–animal relations. Her work has sparked debate in primatology, philosophy, and developmental biology. Haraway participated in a collaborative exchange with the feminist theorist Lynn Randolph from 1990 to 1996. Their engagement with specific ideas relating to feminism, technoscience, political consciousness, and other social issues, formed the images and narrative of Haraway&#x27;s book &quot;Modest_Witness&quot; for which she received the Society for Social Studies of Science&#x27;s (4S) Ludwik Fleck Prize in 1999. She was also awarded the American Sociological Association&#x27;s Section on Science, Knowledge and Technology&#x27;s Robert K. Merton award in 1992 for her work &quot;Primate Visions: Gender, Race, and Nature in the World of Modern Science.&quot; In 2017, Haraway was awarded the Wilbur Cross Medal, one of the highest honors for alumni of Yale University. In 2021, Haraway received the Nuevo León Alfonso Reyes Prize for imagining new horizons for the fusion of science, humanities, biology, and philosophy.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Donna Jeanne Haraway was born on September 6, 1944, in Denver, Colorado. Her father, Frank O. Haraway, was a sportswriter for &quot;The Denver Post&quot;. Her mother, Dorothy Mcguire Haraway, who came from an Irish Catholic background, died from a heart attack when Haraway was 16 years old. Haraway attended high school at St. Mary&#x27;s Academy in Cherry Hills Village, Colorado.

Although she is no longer religious, Catholicism had a strong influence on her as she was taught by nuns in her early life. The impression of the eucharist influenced her linkage of the figurative and the material.

=== Education ===
Haraway majored in zoology, with minors in philosophy and English at the Colorado College, on the full-tuition Boettcher Scholarship. After college, Haraway moved to Paris and studied evolutionary philosophy and theology at the Fondation Teilhard de Chardin on a Fulbright scholarship. She completed her Ph.D. in biology at Yale in 1972 writing a dissertation about the use of metaphor in shaping experiments in experimental biology titled &quot;The Search for Organizing Relations: An Organismic Paradigm in Twentieth-Century Developmental Biology.&quot; Her dissertation was later edited into a book and published under the title &quot;Crystals, Fabrics, and Fields: Metaphors of Organicism in Twentieth-Century Developmental Biology&quot;.

=== Later work ===
Haraway was the recipient of several scholarships. In 1999, Haraway received the Society for Social Studies of Science&#x27;s (4S) Ludwik Fleck Prize. In September 2000, Haraway was awarded the Society for Social Studies of Science&#x27;s highest honor, the J. D. Bernal Award, for her &quot;distinguished contributions&quot; to the field. Haraway&#x27;s most famous essay was published in 1985: &quot;A Manifesto for Cyborgs: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the 1980s&quot; and was characterized as &quot;an effort to build an ironic political myth faithful to feminism, socialism, and materialism&quot;.In Haraway&#x27;s thesis, &quot;Situated Knowledges: The Science Question in Feminism and the Privilege of Partial Perspective&quot; (1988), she means to expose the myth of scientific objectivity. Haraway defined the term &quot;situated knowledges&quot; as a means of understanding that all knowledge comes from positional perspectives. Our positionality inherently determines what it is possible to know about an object of interest. Comprehending situated knowledge &quot;allows us to become answerable for what we learn how to see&quot;. Without this accountability, the implicit biases and societal stigmas of the researcher&#x27;s community are twisted into ground truth from which to build assumptions and hypothesis. Haraway&#x27;s ideas in &quot;Situated Knowledges&quot; were heavily influenced by conversations with Nancy Hartsock and other feminist philosophers and activists.

Her book &quot;Primate Visions: Gender, Race, and Nature in the World of Modern Science&quot; (1989) critically focuses on primate research through a feminist lens in order to understand how heterosexual ideology is reflected in primatology.

Currently, Haraway is an American professor emerita in the history of consciousness and feminist studies departments at the University of California, Santa Cruz, United States.

She lives north of San Francisco with her partner, Rusten Hogness.

Haraway has stated that she tries to incorporate collective thinking and all perspectives into her work: &quot;I notice if I have cited nothing but white people, if I have erased indigenous people, if I forget non-human beings, etc. ... You know, I run through some old-fashioned, klutzy categories. Race, sex, class, region, sexuality, gender, species ... I know how fraught all those categories are, but I think those categories still do important work.&quot;

==Major themes==

===&quot;A Cyborg Manifesto&quot;===
In 1985, Haraway published the essay &quot;Manifesto for Cyborgs: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the 1980s&quot; in &quot;Socialist Review&quot;. Although most of Haraway&#x27;s earlier work was focused on emphasizing the masculine bias in scientific culture, she has also contributed greatly to the feminist narratives of the twentieth century. For Haraway, the Manifesto offered a response to the rising conservatism during the 1980s in the United States at a critical juncture at which feminists, to have any real-world significance, had to acknowledge their situatedness within what she terms the &quot;informatics of domination.&quot; Women were no longer on the outside along a hierarchy of privileged binaries but rather deeply imbued, exploited by and complicit within networked hegemony, and had to form their politics as such.

=== Cyborg feminism ===

In her updated essay &quot;A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century&quot;, in her book &quot;Simians, Cyborgs and Women: The Reinvention of Nature&quot; (1991), Haraway uses the cyborg metaphor to explain how fundamental contradictions in feminist theory and identity should be conjoined, rather than resolved, similar to the fusion of machine and organism in cyborgs. The manifesto is also an important feminist critique of capitalism by revealing how men have exploited women&#x27;s reproduction labor, providing a barrier for women to reach full equality in the labor market. She later discussed her thoughts on &quot;A Cyborg Manifesto&quot;, gender and &#x27;post-gender&#x27; in 2006, critiquing distinct and imposed categories; &quot;people are made to live several non-isomorphic categories simultaneously, all of which torque them&quot;.

===&quot;Primate Visions&quot;===
Haraway also writes about the history of science and biology. In &quot;Primate Visions: Gender, Race, and Nature in the World of Modern Science&quot; (1990), she focused on the metaphors and narratives that direct the science of primatology. She asserted that there is a tendency to masculinize the stories about &quot;reproductive competition and sex between aggressive males and receptive females [that] facilitate some and preclude other types of conclusions&quot;. She contended that female primatologists focus on different observations that require more communication and basic survival activities, offering very different perspectives of the origins of nature and culture than the currently accepted ones. Drawing on examples of Western narratives and ideologies of gender, race and class, Haraway questioned the most fundamental constructions of scientific human nature stories based on primates. In &quot;Primate Visions&quot;, she wrote:
My hope has been that the always oblique and sometimes perverse focusing would facilitate revisions of fundamental, persistent western narratives about difference, especially racial and sexual difference; about reproduction, especially in terms of the multiplicities of generators and offspring; and about survival, especially about survival imagined in the boundary conditions of both the origins and ends of history, as told within western traditions of that complex genre.

Haraway&#x27;s aim for science is &quot;to reveal the limits and impossibility of its &#x27;objectivity&#x27; and to consider some recent revisions offered by feminist primatologists&quot;. Haraway presents an alternative perspective to the accepted ideologies that continue to shape the way scientific human nature stories are created.
Haraway urges feminists to be more involved in the world of technoscience and to be credited for that involvement. In a 1997 publication, she remarked:
I want feminists to be enrolled more tightly in the meaning-making processes of technoscientific world-building. I also want feminist—activists, cultural producers, scientists, engineers, and scholars (all overlapping categories) — to be recognized for the articulations and enrollment we have been making all along within technoscience, in spite of the ignorance of most &quot;mainstream&quot; scholars in their characterization (or lack of characterizations) of feminism in relation to both technoscientific practice and technoscience studies. 

=== &quot;Make Kin not Population: Reconceiving Generations&quot; ===
Haraway created a panel called &quot;Make Kin not Babies&quot; in 2015 with five other feminist thinkers. The panel&#x27;s emphasis was on moving human numbers down while paying attention to factors, such as the environment, race, and class. A key phrase of Haraway&#x27;s is &quot;Making babies is different than giving babies a good childhood.&quot; She and another panelist, Adele Clarke, later published the corresponding book &quot;Making Kin not Population: Reconceiving Generations&quot;.

=== Speculative fabulation ===
Speculative fabulation is a concept that is included in many of Haraway&#x27;s works. It includes all of the wild facts that will not hold still, and it indicates a mode of creativity and the story of the Anthropocene. Haraway stresses how this does not mean it is not a fact. In &quot;Staying with the Trouble&quot;, she defines speculative fabulation as &quot;a mode of attention, theory of history, and a practice of worlding,&quot; and she finds it an integral part of scholarly writing and everyday life. In Haraway&#x27;s work she addresses a feminist speculative fabulation and its focusing on making kin instead of babies to ensure the good childhood of all children while controlling the population. &quot;Making Kin not Population: Reconceiving Generations&quot; highlights practices and proposals to implement this theory in society.

=== &quot;The Companion Species Manifesto: Dogs, People, and Significant Otherness&quot; ===
The companion Species Manifesto is to be read as a “personal document”. This work was written to tell the story of cohabitation, coevolution and embodied cross-species sociality. Haraway argues that humans ‘companion’ relationship with dogs can show us the importance of recognizing differences and ‘how to engage with significant otherness&#x27;. The link between humans and animals like dogs can show people how to interact with other humans and nonhumans. Haraway believes that we should be using the term &quot;companion species&quot; instead of &quot;companion animals&quot; because of the relationships we can learn through them.

==Critical responses to Haraway==
Haraway&#x27;s work has been criticized for being &quot;methodologically vague&quot; and using noticeably opaque language that is &quot;sometimes concealing in an apparently deliberate way&quot;. Several reviewers have argued that her understanding of the scientific method is questionable, and that her explorations of epistemology at times leave her texts virtually meaning-free.

A 1991 review of Haraway&#x27;s &quot;Primate Visions&quot;, published in the &quot;International Journal of Primatology&quot;, provides some of the most common criticisms of her view of science, and a 1990 review in the &quot;American Journal of Primatology&quot;, offers a similarly dismissive commentary. In reviewing the book for the &quot;Journal of the History of Biology&quot;, sexologist Anne Fausto-Sterling, who has written extensively on the social construction of gender, sexual identity, gender identity, gender roles, and intersexuality, wrote that the book is &quot;important,&quot; though she wished it &quot;were easier to read.&quot;

In 2017, &quot;ArtReview&quot; named Haraway the third most influential person in the contemporary art world, stating that her work &quot;has become part of the art world’s DNA&quot;.

<doc id="233262" wikidata="Q551512" url="?curid=233262" title="Claude Lanzmann">
<text>Claude Lanzmann (; 27 November 1925 – 5 July 2018) was a French filmmaker, best known for the Holocaust documentary film &quot;Shoah&quot; (1985), which consists of nine and a half hours of oral testimony from Holocaust survivors, without historical footage. He is also known for his 2017 documentary film &quot;Napalm&quot;, about a love affair he had with a North Korean nurse whilst visiting North Korea in 1958, several years after the Korean War.

In addition to filmmaking, Lanzmann had also been the chief editor of &quot;Les Temps Modernes&quot;, a French literary magazine.

==Early life==
Lanzmann was born on 27 November 1925 in Bois-Colombes, France, the son of Paulette () and Armand Lanzmann. His family was Jewish, and had immigrated to France from the Russian Empire. He was the brother of writer Jacques Lanzmann. Lanzmann attended the in Clermont-Ferrand. While his family disguised their identity and went into hiding during World War II, he joined the French resistance at the age of 17, along with his father and brother, and fought in Auvergne. Lanzmann opposed the French war in Algeria and signed the 1960 antiwar petition Manifesto of the 121.

== Career ==

Lanzmann was the chief editor of the journal &quot;Les Temps Modernes&quot;, founded by Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, and lecturer at the European Graduate School in Saas-Fee, Switzerland. In 2009 he published his memoirs under the title &quot;Le lièvre de Patagonie&quot; (&quot;The Patagonian Hare&quot;).

===&quot;Shoah&quot;===

Lanzmann&#x27;s most renowned work, &quot;Shoah&quot; (1985), is a nine-and-a-half-hour oral history of the Holocaust. &quot;Shoah&quot; is made without the use of any historical footage, and uses only first-person testimony from perpetrators and victims, and contemporary footage of Holocaust-related sites. Interviewees include the Polish resistance fighter Jan Karski and the American Holocaust historian Raul Hilberg. When the film was released, the director also published the complete text, including in English translation, with introductions by Lanzmann and Simone de Beauvoir.

Lanzmann disagreed, sometimes angrily, with attempts to understand the why of Hitler, stating that the evil of Hitler cannot or should not be explained and that to do so is immoral and an obscenity.

Lanzmann also oftentimes pushed his subjects to extreme emotional limits to bring out the most authentic reactions for his audience. The interview with barber Abraham Bomba is an epitome of a Claude Lanzmann interview.

A compilation, &quot;Shoah: Unseen Interviews&quot;, was released in 2012, which included interviews filmed at the time of the original production but that never made it into the film.

On 4 July 2018, his last work, &quot;Les Quatre Soeurs&quot; (&quot;&quot;) was released, featuring testimonials from four Holocaust survivors not included in his &quot;Shoah&quot;. Lanzmann died the following day.

==Personal life==

Lanzmann was part of a leftist delegation which visited North Korea in 1958. Toward the end of the visit, he fell in love with a local nurse and had an illicit love affair, which was discovered by the authorities. Never forgetting the romance, he made a 2017 documentary entitled &quot;Napalm&quot;, as the nurse bore scars from American bombings during the Korean War.

From 1952 to 1959, he lived with Simone de Beauvoir. In 1963 he married French actress Judith Magre. He later married Angelika Schrobsdorff, a German-Jewish writer. He divorced a second time, and was the father of Angélique Lanzmann and Félix Lanzmann. Claude Lanzmann died on 5 July 2018 at his Paris home, after having been ill for several days. He was 92.

<doc id="233264" wikidata="Q153455" url="?curid=233264" title="Heinrich Ignaz Franz Biber">
<text>Heinrich Ignaz Franz Biber (bapt. 12 August 1644, Stráž pod Ralskem – 3 May 1704, Salzburg) was a Bohemian-Austrian composer and violinist. Biber worked in Graz and Kroměříž before he illegally left his employer, Prince-Bishop Karl Liechtenstein-Kastelkorn, and settled in Salzburg. He remained there for the rest of his life, publishing much of his music but apparently seldom, if ever, giving concert tours.

Biber was among the major composers for the violin in the history of the instrument. His own technique allowed him to easily reach the 6th and 7th positions, employ multiple stops in intricate polyphonic passages, and explore the various possibilities of scordatura tuning. Among other pieces, Biber wrote operas, sacred music and music for chamber ensemble. He also wrote one of the earliest known pieces for solo violin, the monumental passacaglia of the &quot;Mystery Sonatas&quot;. 

During Biber&#x27;s lifetime, his music was known and imitated throughout Europe. In the late 18th century he was named the best violin composer of the 17th century by music historian Charles Burney. In the late 20th century Biber&#x27;s music, especially the &quot;Mystery Sonatas&quot;, enjoyed a renaissance. Today, it is widely performed and recorded.

== Biography ==
Biber was born in Wartenberg, Bohemia (now Stráž pod Ralskem, Czech Republic). Little is known about his early education, other than that he may have studied at a Jesuit Gymnasium at Troppau in Bohemia, and that he may have had musical education by a local organist. Before 1668 Biber worked at the court of Prince Johann Seyfried von Eggenberg in Graz, and then he was employed by the Bishop of Olomouc, Karl II von Liechtenstein-Kastelkorn, in Kroměříž. Biber&#x27;s associate from the early 1660s, Pavel Josef Vejvanovský, worked there as director of the Kapelle. Biber apparently enjoyed a good reputation, and his violin playing skills were very highly regarded.
In summer 1670 Karl II sent Biber to Absam, near Innsbruck, to negotiate with the celebrated instrument maker Jacob Stainer for the purchase of new instruments for the Kapelle. Biber never reached Stainer, however, and instead entered the employ of the Archbishop of Salzburg, Maximilian Gandolph von Kuenburg. Because Karl and Maximilian were friends, Biber&#x27;s former employer refrained from taking any action; he was, however, very hurt by the composer&#x27;s decision, and waited until 1676 to officially issue his release papers. It is not coincidental that most of the autograph compositions Biber sent to Kremsier date from the early 1670s. Biber remained in Salzburg for the rest of his life.

His musical and social careers flourished: he started publishing his music in 1676, performed before the Emperor Leopold I (and was rewarded by him) in 1677, became deputy Kapellmeister at Salzburg in 1679 and Kapellmeister in 1684. In 1690 Biber was raised to nobility by the Emperor, with the title of Biber von Bibern. Finally, the new Archbishop of Salzburg, Johann Ernst, Count Thun, appointed Biber lord high steward, the highest social rank Biber would attain.
The composer was married on 30 May 1672 at the bishop&#x27;s summer residence, Hellbrunn Palace, just outside Salzburg. His wife Maria Weiss was a daughter of a Salzburg merchant, citizen and tradesman, Peter Weiss. Together they had 11 children, four of whom survived to adulthood. All were musically gifted. Anton Heinrich (1679–1742) and Carl Heinrich (1681–1749) both served as violinists at the Salzburg court, and the latter was promoted to Kapellmeister in 1743. Daughters Maria Cäcilia (born 1674) and Anna Magdalena (1677–1742) became nuns at Santa Clara, Merano, and the Nonnberg Abbey, respectively. Anna Magdalena was an alto singer and a violinist, and in 1727 became director of the choir and the Kapelle of the Abbey. She used her father&#x27;s &quot;Singfundament&quot;, a basic singing instruction book, for her work in the Abbey.

On 3 November 1692, Biber was appointed steward by Archbishop Johann Ernst. He then received his .

Biber died in Salzburg in 1704. His grave is located in the Petersfriedhof.

== Works ==

Biber&#x27;s violin music was possibly influenced, on one hand, by the Italian tradition of Marco Uccellini and Carlo Farina, and on the other, by the then-nascent German polyphonic tradition as exemplified by Johann Heinrich Schmelzer, who may have been Biber&#x27;s teacher. Biber&#x27;s achievements included further development of violin technique – he was able to reach the 6th and 7th positions, and his left-hand and bowing techniques were far more advanced than those of contemporary Italian composers. He also excelled at counterpoint, frequently writing fully polyphonic textures, with much use of multiple stops. Yet another area in which Biber made a substantial contribution was the art of scordatura, i.e. music for alternative tunings of the instrument. Finally, much of Biber&#x27;s music employs various forms of number symbolism, &quot;affekte&quot;, programmatic devices, etc., as seen in the symbolic retuning of the violin for the Resurrection sonata of the &quot;Mystery Sonatas&quot;.

During the latter half of the 17th century Biber was, together with the composers of the Dresden school (Johann Jakob Walther and Johann Paul von Westhoff), regarded as one of the best and most influential violinists in Europe. However, soon after his death, German violinists started following the style of Arcangelo Corelli and his imitators.

=== Instrumental music ===
Biber&#x27;s finest scordatura writing is represented in two collections. The first dates from c. 1676 and is known variously as &quot;Mystery Sonatas&quot;, &quot;Rosary Sonatas&quot; (&quot;Mysterien Sonaten&quot;, &quot;Die Rosenkranz-Sonaten&quot;), &quot;Copper-Plate Engraving Sonatas&quot;, etc., remaining unpublished during the composer&#x27;s lifetime. It comprises sixteen pieces: fifteen sonatas for violin and continuo portraying the fifteen Mysteries of the Rosary, and a long passacaglia for solo violin. In the extant copy of the collection, each piece is accompanied by a small engraving depicting the mystery it portrays, while the image (an ink drawing) preceding the passacaglia depicts a guardian angel with a child. Only the first and the last pieces use normal tuning; all others employ some form of scordatura:

The sonatas were dedicated to Maximilian Gandolph von Khuenburg, whom Biber addresses in the preface: &quot;I have consecrated the whole to the honour of the XV Sacred Mysteries, which you promote so strongly.&quot; Although unpublished during the composer&#x27;s lifetime, these works are his most popular pieces today, and one of the reasons for the revival of interest in his music. The entire set has been recorded by numerous violinists such as John Holloway, Andrew Manze, and many others. Sonata 15 is famous for one of its themes, which matches the theme of Paganini&#x27;s Caprice No. 24 almost exactly; it is possible that Paganini was inspired by Biber, just as Franz Liszt, Johannes Brahms and Sergei Rachmaninoff were later inspired by Paganini&#x27;s Caprice.

The second work in which Biber explored scordatura techniques is &quot;Harmonia artificioso-ariosa&quot; (1696), his last known published collection of instrumental music. It contains seven partitas for two instruments and basso continuo: five for two violins, one for two violas d&#x27;amore, and one for violin and viola. Six of the partitas require scordatura tunings, including those for viola and two violas d&#x27;amore; Biber uses the full potential of the technique, including all possibilities for complex polyphony: some of the pieces are in five parts, with both of the melodic instruments carrying two. No other chamber works by Biber use such devices, and the only other pieces to use scordatura are two of the sonatas included in &quot;Sonatae violino solo&quot; of 1681. That collection comprises eight sonatas for violin and basso continuo, all noted already by Charles Burney in the late 18th century, for the brilliant virtuosic passages and elaborate structures. In contrast to both &quot;Mystery Sonatas&quot; and &quot;Harmonia&quot;, these works consist mostly of pieces in free forms (prelude, aria) or variations, rather than dances.

Biber&#x27;s other published collections of instrumental music are &quot;Sonatae tam aris quam aulis servientes&quot; (1676), &quot;Mensa sonora&quot; (1680), and &quot;Fidicinium sacro profanum&quot; (1682/3). &quot;Sonatae tam aris&quot; contains sonatas in five, six or eight parts; some of them only use string instruments, some include one or two trumpets. &quot;Mensa sonora&quot; is a set of six partitas for one or two violins, viola, cello, and basso continuo, and &quot;Fidicinium sacro profanum&quot; comprises twelve sonatas for one or two violins, two violas, and continuo. Finally, manuscript sources include numerous other pieces: fantasias, balletti, sonatas, etc. Among these are the &quot;Battalia&quot;, a programmatic &quot;battle&quot; piece which anticipates such latter-day techniques as polytonality and &quot;col legno&quot; playing, and the &quot;Sonata representativa&quot;, another typical 17th-century piece similar to works by Walther and Farina, which imitates various birds and animals. An example of Biber&#x27;s versatility in instrumental music is the &quot;Sonata S Polycarpi&quot;, which is scored for eight trumpets and timpani.

=== Sacred music ===
Unlike most composers for the violin, Biber did not limit himself to music for the instrument. He was also a prolific composer of sacred vocal works: masses, requiems, motets, etc. Many of those were polychoral and employing large instrumental forces, inspired by the possibilities of the spacious interior of the Salzburg Cathedral. Among the polychoral works, &quot;Missa Salisburgensis&quot; (1682) is the best known. An expansive setting of the mass for sixteen voices and 37 instrumentalists (i.e. 53 parts total), it was previously attributed to Orazio Benevoli, but today Biber&#x27;s authorship is certain. The instrumentation includes not only string ensembles, but also oboes, cornetts, trumpets, and timpani. Among his many polychoral works are &quot;Plaudite tympana à 53&quot; (1682) &quot;Vesperae à 32&quot; (1693), &quot;Missa Bruxellensis&quot; (1696) and &quot;Missa Sancti Henrici&quot; (1697), which was composed for the occasion of the taking of the veil by his second daughter, Anna Magdalena, at Nonnberg Abbey in Salzburg. In tribute to the Emperor Henry II, the second founding saint of the convent, she took the name Maria Rosa Henrica when her novitiate began in 1696. The Mass of Saint Henry is scored for a five-voice choir with two soprano lines and an orchestra of two violins, three violas, two trumpets, timpani and continuo, with optional extra trumpets and sackbuts to double the voice parts.

Although Biber is best known for the massive polychoral works, he was also capable of writing for smaller forces. &quot;Missa quadragesimalis&quot; is a simple a cappella setting (with only a continuo part provided) for four voices, as is the &quot;Stabat Mater&quot;.

<text>Krzysztof Pius Zanussi (born 17 June 1939) is a Polish film and theatre director, producer and screenwriter. He is a professor of European film at the European Graduate School in Saas-Fee, Switzerland where he conducts a summer workshop. He is also a professor at the Krzysztof Kieślowski Film School of the University of Silesia in Katowice.

He is the recipient of the Golden Lion at the 1984 Venice Film Festival for &quot;A Year of the Quiet Sun&quot;, the Jury Prize at the 1980 Cannes Film Festival for &quot;The Constant Factor&quot; as well as two Grands Prix at the 1977 and 2000 Gdynia Film Festival for &quot;Camouflage&quot; and &quot;Life as a Fatal Sexually Transmitted Disease,&quot; respectively.

==Biography==
Zanussi was born in 1939 in Warsaw as an only child of Jerzy Zanussi and Wanda (&quot;née&quot; Niewiadomska). His father was of Italian ancestry and worked as a structural engineer.

Zanussi studied physics at Warsaw University (Uniwersytet Warszawski) and philosophy at the Jagiellonian University (Uniwersytet Jagielloński) in Kraków. He is a graduate of the prestigious National Film School in Łódź (1967).

He is a director of the Polish Film Studio TOR and has received several prizes and awards, including the David di Donatello Prize of the &quot;Accademia del Cinema Italiano&quot;, the Cavalier&#x27;s Cross of the Polonia Restituta Order, and the Cavalier de L&#x27;Ordre des Sciences et Lettres.

Krzysztof Zanussi has written &quot;On editing an amateur film&quot; (1968), &quot;Discourse on an amateur film&quot; (1978) and a book of memoirs &quot;The Time to Die&quot; (1997). He appeared as himself in &quot;Camera Buff&quot; (1979), a film about an amateur film maker, directed by his friend Krzysztof Kieślowski. His film &quot;The Constant Factor&quot; (1980) () received the Jury Prize at the 1980 Cannes Film Festival. During the 1980s, he spent much of his time in the West.

Among the films that he made during this time was a film entitled &quot;From a Far Country: Pope John Paul II&quot; (1981) about the life of Karol Wojtyła in the context of the complicated history of modern Poland. His 1989 film &quot;Inventory&quot; was entered into the 16th Moscow International Film Festival. His 2000 film &quot;Life as a Fatal Sexually Transmitted Disease&quot; won the Golden St. George at the 22nd Moscow International Film Festival.

His 2002 film &quot;The Supplement&quot; was entered into the 24th Moscow International Film Festival where it won the FIPRESCI Special Mention.

Zanussi has described his 1996 film, &quot;At Full Gallop&quot;, as his most autobiographical work. It follows the director through several years of his boyhood in Poland under post-World War II Communism. Zanussi served at the head of TOR Film Studio in the eighties. When asked about his experience as a producer he said, &quot;Despite the work of the censors the &quot;zespół&quot; [state-owned film company] system assured a partial autonomy to our cineastes during the Communist era&quot;.

According to the records of Institute of National Remembrance since 1962 to 1964 Zanussi was registered without his consent as a secret collaborator of communist Służba Bezpieczeństwa codename &quot;Aktor&quot;. He had several conversations with Communist secret service officers, however he never began to act as a secret collaborator. Zanussi talks openly about his contacts with Służba Bezpieczeństwa but denies any wrongdoing.

He was awarded the Lifetime Achievement award on 20 November 2012 at the 43rd International Film Festival of India held in Goa.

At the end of the 1980s, he co-founded the European Film Academy with Ingmar Bergman which convoked him in the first nucleus of one hundred members. Subsequently, Zanussi left the academy not agreeing with its development as an elitarian club. By the end of the 2000s, Zanussi took part again with the activities and the expansion of the community to around 1.000 members. He remarked the potential leading role of the academy for the European intercultural cinematographic productions, especially for those realized in non-English languages on the model of the successful experiences of the 1960s. He is the honorary president of Italian People and Religions – Terni Film Festival and he promoted the constitution of a web inter-religious European festivals consisting of Terni Film Festival in Italy, Sacrofilm festival of Zamość in Poland and Journées Cinema et Réconciliation of Notre Dame de La Salette in France.

<text>Martensite is a very hard form of steel crystalline structure. It is named after German metallurgist Adolf Martens. By analogy the term can also refer to any crystal structure that is formed by diffusionless transformation.

==Properties==
Martensite is formed in carbon steels by the rapid cooling (quenching) of the austenite form of iron at such a high rate that carbon atoms do not have time to diffuse out of the crystal structure in large enough quantities to form cementite (Fe3C). Austenite is gamma-phase iron (γ-Fe), a solid solution of iron and alloying elements. As a result of the quenching, the face-centered cubic austenite transforms to a highly strained body-centered tetragonal form called martensite that is supersaturated with carbon. The shear deformations that result produce a large number of dislocations, which is a primary strengthening mechanism of steels. The highest hardness of a pearlitic steel is 400 Brinell, whereas martensite can achieve 700 Brinell. 

The martensitic reaction begins during cooling when the austenite reaches the martensite start temperature (Ms), and the parent austenite becomes mechanically unstable. As the sample is quenched, an increasingly large percentage of the austenite transforms to martensite until the lower transformation temperature Mf is reached, at which time the transformation is completed.

For a eutectoid steel (0.76% C), between 6 and 10% of austenite, called retained austenite, will remain. The percentage of retained austenite increases from insignificant for less than 0.6% C steel, to 13% retained austenite at 0.95% C and 30–47% retained austenite for a 1.4% carbon steel. A very rapid quench is essential to create martensite. For a eutectoid carbon steel of thin section, if the quench starting at 750 °C and ending at 450 °C takes place in 0.7 seconds (a rate of 430 °C/s) no pearlite will form, and the steel will be martensitic with small amounts of retained austenite.

For steel with 0–0.6% carbon, the martensite has the appearance of lath and is called lath martensite. For steel with greater than 1% carbon, it will form a plate-like structure called plate martensite. Between those two percentages, the physical appearance of the grains is a mix of the two. The strength of the martensite is reduced as the amount of retained austenite grows. If the cooling rate is slower than the critical cooling rate, some amount of pearlite will form, starting at the grain boundaries where it will grow into the grains until the Ms temperature is reached, then the remaining austenite transforms into martensite at about half the speed of sound in steel.

In certain alloy steels, martensite can be formed by working the steel at Ms temperature by quenching to below Ms and then working by plastic deformations to reductions of cross section area between 20% and 40% of the original. The process produces dislocation densities up to 1013/cm2. The great number of dislocations, combined with precipitates that originate and pin the dislocations in place, produces a very hard steel. This property is frequently used in toughened ceramics like yttria-stabilized zirconia and in special steels like TRIP steels. Thus, martensite can be thermally induced or stress induced.

The growth of martensite phase requires very little thermal activation energy because the process is a diffusionless transformation, which results in the subtle but rapid rearrangement of atomic positions, and has been known to occur even at cryogenic temperatures. Martensite has a lower density than austenite, so that the martensitic transformation results in a relative change of volume. Of considerably greater importance than the volume change is the shear strain, which has a magnitude of about 0.26 and which determines the shape of the plates of martensite.

Martensite is not shown in the equilibrium phase diagram of the iron-carbon system because it is not an equilibrium phase. Equilibrium phases form by slow cooling rates that allow sufficient time for diffusion, whereas martensite is usually formed by very high cooling rates. Since chemical processes (the attainment of equilibrium) accelerate at higher temperature, martensite is easily destroyed by the application of heat. This process is called tempering. In some alloys, the effect is reduced by adding elements such as tungsten that interfere with cementite nucleation, but more often than not, the nucleation is allowed to proceed to relieve stresses. Since quenching can be difficult to control, many steels are quenched to produce an overabundance of martensite, then tempered to gradually reduce its concentration until the preferred structure for the intended application is achieved. The needle-like microstructure of martensite leads to brittle behavior of the material. Too much martensite leaves steel brittle; too little leaves it soft.

<text>Přemysl the Ploughman ( &quot;Přemysl Oráč&quot;; English: Premysl, Przemysl or Primislaus) was the legendary husband of Libuše, and ancestor of the Přemyslid dynasty, containing the line of princes (dukes) and kings which ruled in the Lands of the Bohemian Crown from 873 or earlier until the murder of Wenceslaus III in 1306.

==Legend==
According to a legend, Přemysl was a free peasant of the village of Stadice who attracted the notice of Libuše, daughter of a certain Krok, who ruled over a large part of Bohemia. Libuše succeeded her father, and her councillors demanded that she marry, but because Přemysl was not a nobleman she recounted a vision in which they would follow a horse let loose at a junction, and follow it to find her future husband, making it appear as if it was the will of fate not her own wish. Two versions of the legend exist, one in where they are to find a man ploughing a field with one broken sandal, and another in which the man would be sitting in the shade of a single tree, eating from an iron table (his plough). They did so and found Přemysl exactly as foretold.

Přemysl married Libuše, the traditional foundress of Prague, and became prince of the Bohemian Czechs. However, according to the legends, because they found him before he had finished ploughing the field famine was anticipated for the land and did actually come about. He was also said to have planted his hazel-wood staff in the ground before he left, which then grew three sprouts, two of which died but the third continued to grow; this was an omen that his first two sons with Libuše, Radobyl and Lidomir, would die, but their third son, Nezamysl would live and continue the Přemyslid dynasty. Legend has it that the staff continued to grow, and the inhabitants of the neighbouring town were given a grant exempting them from taxes, except for a pint of hazel nuts each year, a tradition which continued into the reign of Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor, from whom Pope Pius II claimed to have seen a charter renewing the exemption.

He was also said to have removed his peasant&#x27;s bast shoes before donning the royal robe when he was discovered, and ordered the councillors to bring the shoes with them and keep them as a reminder to the people that a peasant had risen to the highest rank, and to his successors to be humble, remember their origin, and defend the peasantry. The custom of exhibiting a pair of bast shoes at the coronation of the kings of Bohemia was said to have continued throughout the Přemyslid dynasty.

The Přemyslid dynasty became extinct in the male line when Wenceslaus III died, but through women the title to Bohemia passed from the Přemyslids to the Luxembourgs and later to the houses of Jagiello, Habsburg and Habsburg-Lorraine.
== Medieval literary traditions ==
The earliest work mentioning the story about Přemysl and Libuše could be the so-called &quot;Christian Legende&quot; (Latin title: &quot;Vita et passio sancti Vencaslai et sanctae Ludmilae aviae eius&quot;) from the end of 10th century, though some historians consider this legend to be a falsum from 12th or 13th century. The legend is further described in the &quot;Cosmas Chronicle&quot; (Latin title: &quot;Chronica Boemorum&quot;) written between 1119 and 1125, &quot;Short writing about Cyril and Methodius&quot; (Latin title: &quot;Diffundente sole&quot;) from the late 12th century and the &quot;Chronicle of Dalimil&quot; from the beginning of 14th century.

Several times the legend was recorded during the reign of king and emperor Charles IV in the late 14th century. E.g., the so-called &quot;New Chronicle of Bohemiae&quot; by Přibík Pulkava and in the chronicle compiled by Giovanni de&#x27; Marignolli.

A notable theory of origin suggests the names of the early Přemysl ancestors actually arose from a mistaken interpretation by Cosmas. According to postulation by Vladimír Karbusický, Cosmas likely contrived them when trying to read a lost Latin transcription of an old-Slavonic message. When the ancestral names are combined and reassessed, they can roughly cohere an assumed text:

&quot;&quot;Krok‘ kazi tetha lubossa premisl nezamisl mna ta voj‘n ni zla kr‘z mis neklan gosti vit...&quot;

In modern English, this may translate to:

&quot;Halt your steps, Tetha, and rather think, I do not intend war or evil upon you, we do not bow to the cross, we welcome guests&quot;...&quot;

The alleged message is speculated to be from the Czech princes to the Franks, perhaps in relation to the Battle of Zásek c. 849 described in the Annales Fuldenses.

==Arts==
In addition to appearing in works named for Libuše, Přemysl is also a subject of the writings of Wenceslaus Hajek of Libočany published in 1541, a 1779 ballad by Johann Gottfried Herder, fairy tales by Johann Karl August Musäus, and Clemens Brentano&#x27;s 1815 &quot;The Founding of Prague&quot;.

<text>The Bullmastiff is an English breed of dog of mastiff type and large size, with a solid build and a short muzzle. It was developed as a guard dog in the nineteenth century by cross-breeding the English Mastiff with the now-extinct Old English Bulldog. It was recognised as a breed by The Kennel Club in 1924.

== History ==

The origins of the Bullmastiff are unclear. In the 18th century, in some regions of England, the English Mastiff and Old English Bulldog were commonly inter-bred to produce dogs suitable for guarding people and their property. By the beginning of the 20th century, this cross-breed was in widespread use as an aid to gamekeepers in the control of poaching. They were bred for strength, size and speed using a cross of the tough, heavy and aggressive 19th century Bulldog with the large, strong, less aggressive Mastiff. As a result, the Bullmastiff is known as the Gamekeeper&#x27;s Night Dog.

The Bullmastiff was recognised as a breed by The Kennel Club in 1924. Dogs had to have a minimum of four generations of descent from Bullmastiff stock without input from either Bulldog or Mastiff; cross-bred animals could not be registered. The American Kennel Club recognised it in 1934.It was definitively accepted by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale in 1955.

In 1928, the De Beers diamond mining company imported Bullmastiffs to South Africa to guard the mines.

==Appearance==

The Bullmastiff is a large dog. Bitches stand some at the withers, and usually weigh ; on average, dogs stand about taller and weigh more.

The coat may be fawn, red, or brindle, in any shade; some limited white marking on the chest is allowed. The muzzle is black, becoming paler towards the eyes.

The Bullmastiff is brachycephalic, flat-faced and short-muzzled, but this does not affect its breathing.

==Health==
A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 10.2 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

Health concerns within the breed include hip and elbow dysplasia, progressive retinal atrophy, bloat, and cancer, with a relatively high incidence of lymphoma and mast cell tumours. Bullmastiffs are prone to certain hereditary diseases, including:
* Hip dysplasia, affecting 24.5% of individuals 
* Elbow dysplasia, affecting 13.8% of individuals,
* Entropion, hypothyroidism affecting 2.8% of individuals, 
* Lymphoma

An autosomal dominant form of progressive retinal atrophy is common in the breed. A mutation to the RHO gene is responsible.

Bullmastiffs also are prone to ear infections.

<text>Brown algae (: alga) are a large group of multicellular algae comprising the class Phaeophyceae. They include many seaweeds located in colder waters of the Northern Hemisphere. Brown algae are the major seaweeds of the temperate and polar regions. Many brown algae, such as members of the order Fucales, commonly grow along rocky seashores. Most brown algae live in marine environments, where they play an important role both as food and as a potential habitat. For instance, &quot;Macrocystis&quot;, a kelp of the order Laminariales, may reach in length and forms prominent underwater kelp forests that contain a high level of biodiversity. Another example is &quot;Sargassum&quot;, which creates unique floating mats of seaweed in the tropical waters of the Sargasso Sea that serve as the habitats for many species. Some members of the class, such as kelps, are used by humans as food.

Between 1,500 and 2,000 species of brown algae are known worldwide. Some species, such as &quot;Ascophyllum nodosum&quot;, have become subjects of extensive research in their own right due to their commercial importance. They also have environmental significance through carbon fixation.

Brown algae belong to the Stramenopiles, a clade of eukaryotic organisms that are distinguished from green plants by having chloroplasts surrounded by four membranes, suggesting that they were acquired secondarily from a symbiotic relationship between a basal eukaryote and a red or green alga. Most brown algae contain the pigment fucoxanthin, which is responsible for the distinctive greenish-brown color that gives them their name. Brown algae are unique among Stramenopiles in developing into multicellular forms with differentiated tissues, but they reproduce by means of flagellated spores and gametes that closely resemble cells of single-celled Stramenopiles. Genetic studies show their closest relatives to be the yellow-green algae.

==Morphology==
Brown algae exist in a wide range of sizes and forms. The smallest members of the group grow as tiny, feathery tufts of threadlike cells no more than a few centimeters (a few inches) long. Some species have a stage in their life cycle that consists of only a few cells, making the entire alga microscopic. Other groups of brown algae grow to much larger sizes. The rockweeds and leathery kelps are often the most conspicuous algae in their habitats. Kelps can range in size from the sea palm &quot;Postelsia&quot; to the giant kelp &quot;Macrocystis pyrifera&quot;, which grows to over long and is the largest of all the algae. In form, the brown algae range from small crusts or cushions to leafy free-floating mats formed by species of &quot;Sargassum&quot;. They may consist of delicate felt-like strands of cells, as in &quot;Ectocarpus&quot;, or of flattened branches resembling a fan, as in &quot;Padina&quot;.

Regardless of size or form, two visible features set the Phaeophyceae apart from all other algae. First, members of the group possess a characteristic color that ranges from an olive green to various shades of brown. The particular shade depends upon the amount of fucoxanthin present in the alga. Second, all brown algae are multicellular. There are no known species that exist as single cells or as colonies of cells, and the brown algae are the only major group of seaweeds that does not include such forms. However, this may be the result of classification rather than a consequence of evolution, as all the groups hypothesized to be the closest relatives of the browns include single-celled or colonial forms. They can change color depending on salinity, ranging from reddish to brown.

===Visible structures===

Whatever their form, the body of all brown algae is termed a &quot;thallus&quot;, indicating that it lacks the complex xylem and phloem of vascular plants. This does not mean that brown algae completely lack specialized structures. But, because some botanists define &quot;true&quot; stems, leaves, and roots by the presence of these tissues, their absence in the brown algae means that the stem-like and leaf-like structures found in some groups of brown algae must be described using different terminology. Although not all brown algae are structurally complex, those that are typically possess one or more characteristic parts.

A &quot;holdfast&quot; is a rootlike structure present at the base of the algae. Like a root system in plants, a holdfast serves to anchor the alga in place on the &quot;substrate&quot; where it grows, and thus prevents the alga from being carried away by the current. Unlike a root system, the holdfast generally does not serve as the primary organ for water uptake, nor does it take in nutrients from the substrate. The overall physical appearance of the holdfast differs among various brown algae and among various substrates. It may be heavily branched, or it may be cup-like in appearance. A single alga typically has just one holdfast, although some species have more than one stipe growing from their holdfast.

A &quot;stipe&quot; is a stalk or stemlike structure present in an alga. It may grow as a short structure near the base of the alga (as in &quot;Laminaria&quot;), or it may develop into a large, complex structure running throughout the algal body (as in &quot;Sargassum&quot; or &quot;Macrocystis&quot;). In the most structurally differentiated brown algae (such as &quot;Fucus&quot;), the tissues within the stipe are divided into three distinct layers or regions. These regions include a central pith, a surrounding cortex, and an outer epidermis, each of which has an analog in the stem of a vascular plant. In some brown algae, the pith region includes a core of elongated cells that resemble the phloem of vascular plants both in structure and function. In others (such as &quot;Nereocystis&quot;), the center of the stipe is hollow and filled with gas that serves to keep that part of the alga buoyant. The stipe may be relatively flexible and elastic in species like &quot;Macrocystis pyrifera&quot; that grow in strong currents, or may be more rigid in species like &quot;Postelsia palmaeformis&quot; that are exposed to the atmosphere at low tide.

Many algae have a flattened portion that may resemble a leaf, and this is termed a &quot;blade&quot;, &quot;lamina&quot;, or &quot;frond&quot;. The name &quot;blade&quot; is most often applied to a single undivided structure, while &quot;frond&quot; may be applied to all or most of an algal body that is flattened, but this distinction is not universally applied. The name &quot;lamina&quot; refers to that portion of a structurally differentiated alga that is flattened. It may be a single or a divided structure, and may be spread over a substantial portion of the alga. In rockweeds, for example, the lamina is a broad wing of tissue that runs continuously along both sides of a branched &quot;midrib&quot;. The midrib and lamina together constitute almost all of a rockweed, so that the lamina is spread throughout the alga rather than existing as a localized portion of it.
In some brown algae, there is a single lamina or blade, while in others there may be many separate blades. Even in those species that initially produce a single blade, the structure may tear with rough currents or as part of maturation to form additional blades. These blades may be attached directly to the stipe, to a holdfast with no stipe present, or there may be an air bladder between the stipe and blade. The surface of the lamina or blade may be smooth or wrinkled; its tissues may be thin and flexible or thick and leathery. In species like &quot;Egregia menziesii&quot;, this characteristic may change depending upon the turbulence of the waters in which it grows. In other species, the surface of the blade is coated with slime to discourage the attachment of epiphytes or to deter herbivores. Blades are also often the parts of the alga that bear the reproductive structures.

Gas-filled floats called &quot;pneumatocysts&quot; provide buoyancy in many kelps and members of the Fucales. These bladder-like structures occur in or near the &quot;lamina&quot;, so that it is held nearer the water surface and thus receives more light for photosynthesis. Pneumatocysts are most often spherical or ellipsoidal, but can vary in shape among different species. Species such as &quot;Nereocystis luetkeana&quot; and &quot;Pelagophycus porra&quot; bear a single large pneumatocyst between the top of the stipe and the base of the blades. In contrast, the giant kelp &quot;Macrocystis pyrifera&quot; bears many blades along its stipe, with a pneumatocyst at the base of each blade where it attaches to the main stipe. Species of &quot;Sargassum&quot; also bear many blades and pneumatocysts, but both kinds of structures are attached separately to the stipe by short stalks. In species of &quot;Fucus&quot;, the pneumatocysts develop within the lamina itself, either as discrete spherical bladders or as elongated gas-filled regions that take the outline of the lamina in which they develop.

===Growth===
The brown algae include the largest and fastest growing of seaweeds. Fronds of &quot;Macrocystis&quot; may grow as much as per day, and the stipes can grow in a single day.

Growth in most brown algae occurs at the tips of structures as a result of divisions in a single &quot;apical cell&quot; or in a row of such cells. They are single cellular organisms. As this apical cell divides, the new cells that it produces develop into all the tissues of the alga. Branchings and other lateral structures appear when the apical cell divides to produce two new apical cells. However, a few groups (such as &quot;Ectocarpus&quot;) grow by a diffuse, unlocalized production of new cells that can occur anywhere on the thallus.

===Tissue organization===

The simplest brown algae are filamentous—that is, their cells are elongate and have septa cutting across their width. They branch by getting wider at their tip, and then dividing the widening.

These filaments may be haplostichous or polystichous, multiaxial or monoaxial forming or not a pseudoparenchyma. Besides fronds, there are the large in size parenchymatic kelps with three-dimensional development and growth and different tissues (, cortex and ) which could be consider the trees of the sea. There are also the Fucales and Dictyotales smaller than kelps but still parenchymatic with the same kind of distinct tissues.

The cell wall consists of two layers; the inner layer bears the strength, and consists of cellulose; the outer wall layer is mainly algin, and is gummy when wet but becomes hard and brittle when it dries out. Specifically, the brown algal cell wall consists of several components with alginates and sulphated fucan being its main ingredients, up to 40% each of them. Cellulose, a major component from most plant cell walls, is present in a very small percentage, up to 8%. Cellulose and alginate biosynthesis pathways seem to have been acquired from other organisms through endosymbiotic and horizontal gene transfer respectively, while the sulphated polysaccharides are of ancestral origin. Specifically, the cellulose synthases seem to come from the red alga endosymbiont of the photosynthetic stramenopiles ancestor, and the ancestor of brown algae acquired the key enzymes for alginates biosynthesis from an actinobacterium. The presence and fine control of alginate structure in combination with the cellulose which existed before it, gave potentially the brown algae the ability to develop complex structurally multicellular organisms like the kelps.

==Evolutionary history==

Genetic and ultrastructural evidence place the Phaeophyceae among the heterokonts (Stramenopiles), a large assemblage of organisms that includes both photosynthetic members with plastids (such as the diatoms) as well as non-photosynthetic groups (such as the slime nets and water molds). Although some heterokont relatives of the brown algae lack plastids in their cells, scientists believe this is a result of evolutionary loss of that organelle in those groups rather than independent acquisition by the several photosynthetic members. Thus, all heterokonts are believed to descend from a single heterotrophic ancestor that became photosynthetic when it acquired plastids through endosymbiosis of another unicellular eukaryote.

The closest relatives of the brown algae include unicellular and filamentous species, but no unicellular species of brown algae are known. However, most scientists assume that the Phaeophyceae evolved from unicellular ancestors. DNA sequence comparison also suggests that the brown algae evolved from the filamentous Phaeothamniophyceae, Xanthophyceae, or the Chrysophyceae between 150 and 200 million years ago. In many ways, the evolution of the brown algae parallels that of the green algae and red algae, as all three groups possess complex multicellular species with an alternation of generations. Analysis of 5S rRNA sequences reveals much smaller evolutionary distances among genera of the brown algae than among genera of red or green algae, which suggests that the brown algae have diversified much more recently than the other two groups.

===Fossils===
The occurrence of Phaeophyceae as fossils is rare due to their generally soft-bodied nature, and scientists continue to debate the identification of some finds. Part of the problem with identification lies in the convergent evolution of morphologies between many brown and red algae. Most fossils of soft-tissue algae preserve only a flattened outline, without the microscopic features that permit the major groups of multicellular algae to be reliably distinguished. Among the brown algae, only species of the genus &quot;Padina&quot; deposit significant quantities of minerals in or around their cell walls. Other algal groups, such as the red algae and green algae, have a number of calcareous members. Because of this, they are more likely to leave evidence in the fossil record than the soft bodies of most brown algae and more often can be precisely classified.

Fossils comparable in morphology to brown algae are known from strata as old as the Upper Ordovician, but the taxonomic affinity of these impression fossils is far from certain. Claims that earlier Ediacaran fossils are brown algae have since been dismissed. While many carbonaceous fossils have been described from the Precambrian, they are typically preserved as flattened outlines or fragments measuring only millimeters long. Because these fossils lack features diagnostic for identification at even the highest level, they are assigned to fossil form taxa according to their shape and other gross morphological features. A number of Devonian fossils termed &quot;fucoids&quot;, from their resemblance in outline to species in the genus &quot;Fucus&quot;, have proven to be inorganic rather than true fossils. The Devonian megafossil &quot;Prototaxites&quot;, which consists of masses of filaments grouped into trunk-like axes, has been considered a possible brown alga. However, modern research favors reinterpretation of this fossil as a terrestrial fungus or fungal-like organism. Likewise, the fossil &quot;Protosalvinia&quot; was once considered a possible brown alga, but is now thought to be an early land plant.

A number of Paleozoic fossils have been tentatively classified with the brown algae, although most have also been compared to known red algae species. &quot;Phascolophyllaphycus&quot; possesses numerous elongate, inflated blades attached to a stipe. It is the most abundant of algal fossils found in a collection made from Carboniferous strata in Illinois. Each hollow blade bears up to eight pneumatocysts at its base, and the stipes appear to have been hollow and inflated as well. This combination of characteristics is similar to certain modern genera in the order Laminariales (kelps). Several fossils of &quot;Drydenia&quot; and a single specimen of &quot;Hungerfordia&quot; from the Upper Devonian of New York have also been compared to both brown and red algae. Fossils of &quot;Drydenia&quot; consist of an elliptical blade attached to a branching filamentous holdfast, not unlike some species of &quot;Laminaria&quot;, &quot;Porphyra&quot;, or &quot;Gigartina&quot;. The single known specimen of &quot;Hungerfordia&quot; branches dichotomously into lobes and resembles genera like &quot;Chondrus&quot; and &quot;Fucus&quot; or &quot;Dictyota&quot;.

The earliest known fossils that can be assigned reliably to the Phaeophyceae come from Miocene diatomite deposits of the Monterey Formation in California. Several soft-bodied brown macroalgae, such as &quot;Julescraneia&quot;, have been found.

==Life cycle==
Most brown algae, with the exception of the Fucales, perform sexual reproduction through sporic meiosis. Between generations, the algae go through separate sporophyte (diploid) and gametophyte (haploid) phases. The sporophyte stage is often the more visible of the two, though some species of brown algae have similar diploid and haploid phases. Free floating forms of brown algae often do not undergo sexual reproduction until they attach themselves to substrate. The haploid generation consists of male and female gametophytes. The fertilization of egg cells varies between species of brown algae, and may be isogamous, oogamous, or anisogamous. Fertilization may take place in the water with eggs and motile sperm, or within the oogonium itself.

Certain species of brown algae can also perform asexual reproduction through the production of motile diploid zoospores. These zoospores form in plurilocular sporangium, and can mature into the sporophyte phase immediately.

In a representative species &quot;Laminaria&quot;, there is a conspicuous diploid generation and smaller haploid generations. Meiosis takes place within several unilocular sporangium along the algae&#x27;s blade, each one forming either haploid male or female zoospores. The spores are then released from the sporangia and grow to form male and female gametophytes. The female gametophyte produces an egg in the oogonium, and the male gametophyte releases motile sperm that fertilize the egg. The fertilized zygote then grows into the mature diploid sporophyte.

In the order Fucales, sexual reproduction is oogamous, and the mature diploid is the only form for each generation. Gametes are formed in specialized conceptacles that occur scattered on both surfaces of the receptacle, the outer portion of the blades of the parent plant. Egg cells and motile sperm are released from separate sacs within the conceptacles of the parent algae, combining in the water to complete fertilization. The fertilized zygote settles onto a surface and then differentiates into a leafy thallus and a finger-like holdfast. Light regulates differentiation of the zygote into blade and holdfast.(by samay the great )

== Ecology ==
Brown algae have adapted to a wide variety of marine ecological niches including the tidal splash zone, rock pools, the whole intertidal zone and relatively deep near shore waters. They are an important constituent of some brackish water ecosystems, and have colonized freshwater on a minimum of six known occasions. A large number of Phaeophyceae are intertidal or upper littoral, and they are predominantly cool and cold water organisms that benefit from nutrients in up welling cold water currents and inflows from land; &quot;Sargassum&quot; being a prominent exception to this generalisation.

Brown algae growing in brackish waters are almost solely asexual.

==Chemistry==

Brown algae have a value in the range of −30.0‰ to −10.5‰, in contrast with red algae and greens. This reflects their different metabolic pathways.

They have cellulose walls with alginic acid and also contain the polysaccharide fucoidan in the amorphous sections of their cell walls. A few species (of &quot;Padina&quot;) calcify with aragonite needles.

In addition to alginates, fucoidan and cellulose, the carbohydrate composition of brown algae consists of mannitol, laminarin and glucan.

The photosynthetic system of brown algae is made of a P700 complex containing chlorophyll a. Their plastids also contain chlorophyll c and carotenoids (the most widespread of those being fucoxanthin).

Brown algae produce a specific type of tannin called phlorotannins in higher amounts than red algae do.

==Importance and uses==
Brown algae include a number of edible seaweeds. All brown algae contain alginic acid (alginate) in their cell walls, which is extracted commercially and used as an industrial thickening agent in food and for other uses. One of these products is used in lithium-ion batteries. Alginic acid is used as a stable component of a battery anode. This polysaccharide is a major component of brown algae, and is not found in land plants.

Alginic acid can also be used in aquaculture. For example, alginic acid enhances the immune system of rainbow trout. Younger fish are more likely to survive when given a diet with alginic acid.

Brown algae including kelp beds also fix a significant portion of the earth&#x27;s carbon dioxide yearly through photosynthesis. Additionally, they can store a great amount of carbon dioxide which can help us in the fight against climate change.
Sargachromanol G, an extract of Sargassum siliquastrum, has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects.

<text>Cementite (or iron carbide) is a compound of iron and carbon, more precisely an intermediate transition metal carbide with the formula Fe3C. By weight, it is 6.67% carbon and 93.3% iron. It has an orthorhombic crystal structure. It is a hard, brittle material, normally classified as a ceramic in its pure form, and is a frequently found and important constituent in ferrous metallurgy. While cementite is present in most steels and cast irons, it is produced as a raw material in the iron carbide process, which belongs to the family of alternative ironmaking technologies. The name &quot;cementite&quot; originated from the theory of Floris Osmond and J. Werth, in which the structure of solidified steel consists of a kind of cellular tissue, with ferrite as the nucleus and Fe3C the envelope of the cells. The carbide therefore &quot;cemented&quot; the iron.

==Metallurgy==
In the iron–carbon system (i.e. plain-carbon steels and cast irons) it is a common constituent because ferrite can contain at most 0.02wt% of uncombined carbon. Therefore, in carbon steels and cast irons that are slowly cooled, a portion of the carbon is in the form of cementite. Cementite forms directly from the melt in the case of white cast iron. In carbon steel, cementite precipitates from austenite as austenite transforms to ferrite on slow cooling, or from martensite during tempering. An intimate mixture with ferrite, the other product of austenite, forms a lamellar structure called pearlite.
While cementite is thermodynamically unstable, eventually being converted to austenite (low carbon level) and graphite (high carbon level) at higher temperatures, it does not decompose on heating at temperatures below the eutectoid temperature (723 °C) on the metastable iron-carbon phase diagram.

Mechanical properties are as follows: room temperature microhardness 760–1350 HV; bending strength 4.6–8 GPa, Young&#x27;s modulus 160–180 GPa, indentation fracture toughness 1.5–2.7 MPa√m.

The morphology of cementite plays a critical role in the kinetics of phase transformations in steel. The coiling temperature and cooling rate significantly affect cementite formation. At lower coiling temperatures, cementite forms fine pearlitic colonies, whereas at higher temperatures, it precipitates as coarse particles at grain boundaries. This morphological difference influences the rate of austenite formation and decomposition, with fine cementite promoting faster transformations due to its increased surface area and the proximity of the carbide-ferrite interface. Furthermore, the dissolution kinetics of cementite during annealing are slower for coarse carbides, impacting the microstructural evolution during heat treatments.

==Pure form==

Cementite changes from ferromagnetic to paramagnetic upon heating to its Curie temperature of approximately .

A natural iron carbide (containing minor amounts of nickel and cobalt) occurs in iron meteorites and is called cohenite after the German mineralogist Emil Cohen, who first described it. 

==Other iron carbides==
There are other forms of metastable iron carbides that have been identified in tempered steel and in the industrial Fischer–Tropsch process. These include epsilon (ε) carbide, hexagonal close-packed Fe2–3C, precipitates in plain-carbon steels of carbon content &gt; 0.2%, tempered at 100–200 °C. Non-stoichiometric ε-carbide dissolves above ~200 °C, where Hägg carbides and cementite begin to form. Hägg carbide, monoclinic Fe5C2, precipitates in hardened tool steels tempered at 200–300 °C. It has also been found naturally as the mineral Edscottite in the Wedderburn meteorite.

<text>USS &quot;Cleveland&quot; (LPD-7), an , was the third ship of the United States Navy to be named for the city in Ohio. Her keel was laid down at Ingalls Shipbuilding of Pascagoula, Mississippi. She was launched on 7 May 1966, and was commissioned on 21 April 1967 at Norfolk, Virginia. At the time of decommissioning, she was the third-oldest commissioned ship in the US Navy, behind (&quot;Old Ironsides&quot;) and .

After commissioning, &quot;Cleveland&quot; changed homeport to San Diego, California, to become a member of the Pacific Fleet&#x27;s Amphibious Force. &quot;Cleveland&quot; divided her time between operations in the Eastern Pacific and extended deployments to the Western Pacific. &quot;Cleveland&quot; was normally assigned as part of an Amphibious Readiness Group (ARG) and, with her embarked Marines and other forces, performed a wide variety of missions.

In 2024, She was used as a SINKEX target and hit by Land Based Anti-Ship Missile.

==1960s to 1980s==
&quot;Cleveland&quot; first saw action during the Tet Offensive in 1968. In 1972 &quot;Cleveland&quot; served close in shore in the DMZ region as a platform for seven Marine AH-1 Cobra helicopters performing operations on NVA troop and supply lines. In January 1973 &quot;Cleveland&quot; was in a task force on its way to make a landing with Marines in North Vietnam when the Paris peace treaty was signed. After the Vietnam War cease-fire in January 1973, &quot;Cleveland&quot; joined Task Force 78 in the mine-clearing effort of Haiphong Harbor and Operation End Sweep. &quot;Cleveland&quot; then began a series of seven Western Pacific deployments between 1974 and 1985.

The ship was assigned duties as the United States Third Fleet flagship from January through November 1988. &quot;Cleveland&quot; then briefly shifted focus to environmental protection when she deployed to Prince William Sound, Alaska, in support of oil spill cleanup efforts associated with the &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; disaster.

==1990s==
The ship&#x27;s next two deployments, in 1990 and 1991, were in support of Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. In October 1992 and in March 1993, &quot;Cleveland&quot; deployed on short notice to Central America in support of law enforcement operations, or LEO OPS where she was the first LPD to embark an SH-60 Seahawk helicopter. During the March 1993 deployment, &quot;Cleveland&quot; and the embarked Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachment (LEDET) played a key role in what was the largest maritime cocaine seizure to date involving the motor vessel &quot;Sea Chariot&quot;. This was the result of an unprecedented Joint Counter Drug Mission between the United States Navy and the Colombian Navy called Operation Emerald. These two deployments included four transits of the Panama Canal and steaming over .

While deployed to the Western Pacific in 1994, &quot;Cleveland&quot; participated in United Nations relief efforts in Rwanda and the relocation of the United States Liaison office from Mogadishu, Somalia, to Nairobi, Kenya. Following the relocation efforts, &quot;Cleveland&quot; was ordered to steam into the North Persian Gulf to assist in deterring Iraq&#x27;s massing of troops on the Kuwaiti border as part of Operation Vigilant Warrior.

Her next inter-deployment cycle was highlighted by Exercise RIMPAC &#x27;96 off the coast of Hawaii, which included the first ever multilateral exercise involving US and Russian forces in US waters. The trip to Hawaii for the exercise culminated in a parade of ships for the 50th anniversary celebration to commemorate the end of the Pacific War. &quot;Cleveland&quot; returned to the North Persian Gulf during her deployment in 1996 and 1997, participating in coalition and bilateral exercises and achieving yet another milestone as the first Amphibious Warship to actively participate in Maritime Interdiction Operations (MIO) in support of United Nations sanctions against Iraq.

In the summer of 1998, &quot;Cleveland&quot; once again participated in the bi-annual RIMPAC exercise. &quot;Cleveland&quot; then began her sixteenth major deployment in December 1998, embarking Navy SEALs, elements of the 13th MEU(SOC) – Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operation Capable) – and a detachment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). During this deployment &quot;Cleveland&quot; stood off the Horn of Africa, inserting a military liaison team into Eritrea and remaining ready to conduct a non-combatant evacuation operation. &quot;Cleveland&quot; then returned to the Persian Gulf to conduct MIO where she served as flagship for the commander of all MIO forces in the Persian Gulf. During this period, an embarked UAV discovered an Iraqi surface-to-surface missile site that was threatening coalition forces. Aircraft from destroyed this missile site while the UAV transmitted live imagery back to &quot;Cleveland&quot;.

==2000s==
&quot;Cleveland&quot; was once again called upon to perform outside her normal realm of operations while participating in recovery and salvage efforts of Alaska Airlines flight 261 in February 2000, receiving the Coast Guard Unit Commendation with Operational Distinguishing Device. Following a Fleet Week visit to San Francisco, California, &quot;Cleveland&quot; completed her training cycle and deployed for the seventeenth time in March 2001.

Deployed in January 2003 in support of operations relevant to the beginning of the ground war which was dubbed Operation Iraqi Freedom by the United States and commenced on 20 March 2003 (prior to 19 March, the mission in Iraq was called Operation Enduring Freedom, a carryover from the War in Afghanistan). The invasion consisted of 21 days of major combat operations, in which a combined force of troops from the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and Poland invaded Iraq and deposed the Ba&#x27;athist government of Saddam Hussein. &quot;Cleveland&quot; sailed as part of the USN Magnificent Seven. Embarked were USMC Amphibious Task Force West and Landing Force West w/ HMM 163 and supporting USMC elements.

&quot;Cleveland&quot; arrived in San Diego on 4 August 2011, returning from Pacific Partnership 2011, concluding the ship&#x27;s final mission prior to its decommissioning. During the course of the ship&#x27;s final mission, the medical contingent treated 38,696 patients at medical and dental civic action projects, or MEDCAPs and DENCAPs.

Both governments of the U.S. and Mexico could not come to an agreement regarding the sale of the vessel; therefore the ship continued on active duty until its decommissioning on 30 September 2011.

The ship was stricken from the naval registry on 13 November 2017. , the ship was moored in the Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. She was sunk as a target during naval live-fire exercise &#x27;Valiant Shield 2024&#x27; by the 7th Fleet flagship in the north Pacific Ocean in coordination with the Multi-Domain Task Force and 181 Field Artillery Regiment of the Tennessee National Guard. The ship was hit as target by a PrSM Increment 2 anti-ship ballistic missile.

==Awards==
In her 44 years of service, &quot;Cleveland&quot; received two Combat Action Ribbons, the Joint Meritorious Unit Award, the Navy Unit Commendation, three Meritorious Unit Commendations, eight Navy Excellence Ribbons, three Armed Forces Expeditionary Medals, 23 Vietnam Service Medals, the Southwest Asia Service Medal, the Humanitarian Service Medal, the Coast Guard Unit Commendation with Operational Distinguishing Device, and three Vietnam Gallantry Cross Unit Citation.

<text>Sandra Caldarone (born 15 October 1972), better known as Sandra Kim, is a Belgian singer of Italian descent who won the Eurovision Song Contest 1986 in Bergen, Norway. Her father was an Italian immigrant from Torrebruna in the Province of Chieti in the Abruzzo region of Italy.

At the time of her Eurovision win, she was only 13 years old, making her the youngest winner of the contest, even though the lyrics of her song &quot;J&#x27;aime la vie&quot; (&quot;I love life&quot;) imply that she is 15; the Swiss petitioned to have the song disqualified after her real age was revealed. This petition ended up failing and Kim went on to win that year&#x27;s Eurovision Song Contest. Kim also represented Belgium at the Yamaha Music Festival in Tokyo during the autumn of 1986 and sang the title song for the French animated television series &quot;Il était une fois... la vie&quot;. Kim&#x27;s pop rock album &quot;Make Up&quot; was released on 12 May 2011, containing songs written by famous Belgian artists like Salvatore Adamo, Dani Klein (Vaya Con Dios), Ozark Henry, Anthony Sinatra (Piano Club), Jacques Duval and David Bartholomé (Sharko). She also won the first season of the Belgian version of The Masked Singer as “Queen”.

In March 2023, Kim was a guest celebrity judge in the episode &quot;A deux c’est mieux&quot; of the Belgian French-language reality television series &quot;Drag Race Belgique&quot;, which was broadcast on Tipik.

==Early life==
Kim was born in Montegnée, near Liège to a hairdresser mother and accordionist father, and started singing when she was seven.

<doc id="233313" wikidata="Q694462" url="?curid=233313" title="Bogofilter">
<text>Bogofilter is a mail filter that classifies e-mail as spam or ham (non-spam) by a statistical analysis of the message&#x27;s header and content (body). The program is able to learn from the user&#x27;s classifications and corrections. It was originally written by Eric S. Raymond after he read Paul Graham&#x27;s article &quot;A Plan for Spam&quot; and is now maintained together with a group of contributors by David Relson, Matthias Andree and Greg Louis.

The statistical technique used is known as Bayesian filtering. Bogofilter&#x27;s primary algorithm uses the &quot;f(w)&quot; parameter and the Fisher inverse chi-square technique that he describes.

Bogofilter may be run by a MDA or mail client to classify messages as they are delivered to recipient mailboxes, or be used by a MTA to classify messages as they are received from the sending SMTP server. Bogofilter examines tokens in the message body and header, and refers to wordlists stored by BerkeleyDB, SQLite or QDBM to calculate a probability score that a new message is spam. Bogofilter provides processing for plain text and HTML and supports reading multi-part MIME message including base64, quoted-printable, and uuencoded text or HTML. Bogofilter ignores non-text attachments, such as images.

It is possible to tune Bogofilter&#x27;s statistical algorithms by modifying various coefficients and other settings in its configuration file, or by using the automated &quot;bogotune&quot; utility included with the software, which attempts to optimise various coefficients to maximise filtering efficiency for a particular corpus of spam and non-spam.

Standard tests at TREC 2005 show that Bogofilter compares well to its competitors spambayes, CRM114 and DSPAM. Other competitors include, but are not limited to Spamprobe and QSF. 

Bogofilter is written in C, and runs on Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, Mac OS X, HP-UX, AIX and other platforms. It is released under the GNU GPL.

== Email clients that can use Bogofilter ==
The following email clients are known to support Bogofilter as a spam filtering backend:

* GNOME Evolution
* Claws Mail
* KMail
* Mutt (email client)
* Alpine (email client)

<text>Austenite, also known as gamma-phase iron (γ-Fe), is a metallic, non-magnetic allotrope of iron or a solid solution of iron with an alloying element. In plain-carbon steel, austenite exists above the critical eutectoid temperature of 1000 K (727 °C); other alloys of steel have different eutectoid temperatures. The austenite allotrope is named after Sir William Chandler Roberts-Austen (1843–1902). It exists at room temperature in some stainless steels due to the presence of nickel stabilizing the austenite at lower temperatures.

==Allotrope of iron==
From alpha iron undergoes a phase transition from body-centered cubic (BCC) to the face-centered cubic (FCC) configuration of gamma iron, also called austenite. This is similarly soft and ductile but can dissolve considerably more carbon (as much as 2.03% by mass at ). This gamma form of iron is present in the most commonly used type of stainless steel for making hospital and food-service equipment.

==Material ==

Austenitization means to heat the iron, iron-based metal, or steel to a temperature at which it changes crystal structure from ferrite to austenite. The more-open structure of the austenite is then able to absorb carbon from the iron-carbides in carbon steel. An incomplete initial austenitization can leave undissolved carbides in the matrix.

For some iron metals, iron-based metals, and steels, the presence of carbides may occur during the austenitization step. The term commonly used for this is two-phase austenitization.

==Austempering==

Austempering is a hardening process that is used on iron-based metals to promote better mechanical properties. The metal is heated into the austenite region of the iron-cementite phase diagram and then quenched in a salt bath or other heat extraction medium that is between temperatures of . The metal is annealed in this temperature range until the austenite turns to bainite or ausferrite (bainitic ferrite + high-carbon austenite).

By changing the temperature for austenitization, the austempering process can yield different and desired microstructures. A higher austenitization temperature can produce a higher carbon content in austenite, whereas a lower temperature produces a more uniform distribution of austempered structure. The carbon content in austenite as a function of austempering time has been established.

==Behavior in plain carbon-steel==

As austenite cools, the carbon diffuses out of the austenite and forms carbon-rich iron-carbide (cementite) and leaves behind carbon-poor ferrite. Depending on alloy composition, a layering of ferrite and cementite, called pearlite, may form. If the rate of cooling is very swift, the carbon does not have sufficient time to diffuse, and the alloy may experience a large lattice distortion known as martensitic transformation in which it transforms into martensite, a body centered tetragonal structure (BCT). The rate of cooling determines the relative proportions of martensite, ferrite, and cementite, and therefore determines the mechanical properties of the resulting steel, such as hardness and tensile strength. 

A high cooling rate of thick sections will cause a steep thermal gradient in the material. The outer layers of the heat treated part will cool faster and shrink more, causing it to be under tension and thermal straining. At high cooling rates, the material will transform from austenite to martensite which is much harder and will generate cracks at much lower strains. The volume change (martensite is less dense than austenite) can generate stresses as well. The difference in strain rates of the inner and outer portion of the part may cause cracks to develop in the outer portion, compelling the use of slower quenching rates to avoid this. By alloying the steel with tungsten, the carbon diffusion is slowed and the transformation to BCT allotrope occurs at lower temperatures, thereby avoiding the cracking. Such a material is said to have its hardenability increased. Tempering following quenching will transform some of the brittle martensite into tempered martensite. If a low-hardenability steel is quenched, a significant amount of austenite will be retained in the microstructure, leaving the steel with internal stresses that leave the product prone to sudden fracture.

As austenite cools, its decomposition plays a crucial role in determining the final microstructure of steel. The kinetics of this transformation are highly influenced by the morphology of the carbides present in the material. The presence of coarse carbides, for instance, can slow down the rate of austenite formation during intercritical annealing, due to their slow dissolution kinetics. Pearlite, a lamellar structure consisting of alternating layers of ferrite and cementite, forms through cooperative nucleation and growth processes from austenite. The thickness of these layers has a direct impact on the mechanical properties of the steel.

The decomposition of austenite is influenced by the cooling rate, which affects the morphology of carbides and thus the final steel structure. Slow cooling rates allow for the development of coarse cementite particles at grain boundaries, while faster cooling rates promote the formation of fine pearlitic colonies. Coiling temperature, in particular, has a significant impact on carbide morphology: lower coiling temperatures (below the eutectoid temperature) promote fine pearlite formation, while higher temperatures encourage the formation of coarse cementite. This difference in carbide morphology influences the rate and temperature at which austenite forms and decomposes during subsequent heat treatments.

==Behavior in cast iron==
Heating white cast iron (containing iron carbide, i.e. cementite, but no uncombined carbon) above causes the formation of austenite in crystals of primary cementite. This austenisation of white iron occurs in primary cementite at the interphase boundary with ferrite. When the grains of austenite form in cementite, they occur as lamellar clusters oriented along the cementite crystal layer surface. Austenite is formed by diffusion of carbon atoms from cementite into ferrite.

==Stabilization at lower temperatures ==

The addition of certain alloying elements, such as manganese and nickel, can stabilize the austenitic structure, facilitating heat-treatment of low-alloy steels. In the extreme case of austenitic stainless steel, much higher alloy content makes this structure stable even at room temperature. 

On the other hand, such elements as silicon, molybdenum, and chromium tend to de-stabilize austenite, raising the eutectoid temperature.

=== Thin films ===
Austenite is only stable above in bulk metal form. However, fcc transition metals can be grown on a face-centered cubic (fcc) or diamond cubic. The epitaxial growth of austenite on the diamond (100) face is feasible because of the close lattice match and the symmetry of the diamond (100) face is fcc. More than a monolayer of γ-iron can be grown because the critical thickness for the strained multilayer is greater than a monolayer. The determined critical thickness is in close agreement with theoretical prediction.

==Transformation and Curie point==
In many magnetic ferrous alloys, the Curie point, the temperature at which magnetic materials cease to behave magnetically, occurs at nearly the same temperature as the austenite transformation. This behavior is attributed to the paramagnetic nature of austenite, while both martensite and ferrite are strongly ferromagnetic.

==Thermo-optical emission, colour indicates temperature ==
During heat treating, a blacksmith causes phase changes in the iron-carbon system to control the material&#x27;s mechanical properties, often using the annealing, quenching, and tempering processes. In this context, the color of light, or &quot;blackbody radiation&quot;, emitted by the workpiece is an approximate gauge of temperature. Temperature is often gauged by watching the color temperature of the work, with the transition from a deep cherry-red to orange-red ( to ) corresponding to the formation of austenite in medium and high-carbon steel. In the visible spectrum, this glow increases in brightness as temperature increases. When cherry-red, the glow is near its lowest intensity and may not be visible in ambient light. Hence blacksmiths usually austenitize steel in low-light conditions to accurately judge the color of the glow.

<doc id="233335" wikidata="Q6586985" url="?curid=233335" title="Tom Whedon">
<text>Thomas Avery Whedon (August 3, 1932 – March 23, 2016) was an American screenwriter and producer from New York known for his work on television programs such as &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, &quot;Benson&quot;, &quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s a Living&quot;, and &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot;. Whedon began his career as one of the original writers on the 1955 television series &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot;. He also collaborated with Jon Stone to produce the 1969 TV film &quot;Hey, Cinderella!&quot; featuring the Muppets.

In 1973, Whedon won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Children&#x27;s Program for the Jim Henson program &quot;The Electric Company&quot;, which was shared with the show&#x27;s writing staff. He received two additional Primetime Emmy Award nominations for &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; in 1990 and 1991 and two Daytime Emmy Award nominations for &quot;The Electric Company&quot; and &quot;Between the Lions&quot;. His father, John Whedon, was also a screenwriter. He had five children, including Joss Whedon, Jed Whedon, and Zack Whedon. Tom Whedon died on March 23, 2016.

==Early life==
Whedon was born in New York City, New York. He was the son of Louise Carroll (Angell) and 1950s TV screenwriter John Whedon. He graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy in 1955. He and his first wife, political activist Ann Lee (née Jeffries) Stearns, are the parents of sons Samuel (b. 1960) and Matthew Thomas (b. 1962), and film and TV screenwriter Joss Whedon (&quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, &quot;Angel&quot;, &quot;Firefly&quot;, &quot;Dollhouse&quot;, and &quot;&quot;Marvel&#x27;s The Avengers&quot;). Tom and his second wife, Pam Webber, are the parents of screenwriter and musician Jed Whedon (&quot;Dr. Horrible&#x27;s Sing-Along Blog&quot;) and scriptwriter Zack Whedon (&quot;Fringe&quot;, &quot;Deadwood&quot;).

==Career==
He was an original writer for the children&#x27;s television show &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot;, which aired on weekday mornings on CBS from 1955 to 1984.

As early as 1964, he collaborated with Jon Stone on a concept for a puppet-centered children&#x27;s television series using the fairy-tale Cinderella as a basis. During this process, they became acquainted with the creative, but then relatively unknown, Jim Henson and his Muppets. The trio went on to make the &quot;Hey, Cinderella!&quot; TV special for ABC in 1970.

In the 1970s, Tom Whedon (along with Stone) worked for the Children&#x27;s Television Workshop, becoming head writer for the award-winning show &quot;The Electric Company&quot;. Additional writing credits include the more adult fare of &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot;, &quot;Benson&quot;, &quot;Alice&quot;, and &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;.

==Death==
Whedon died on March 23, 2016, surrounded by family, according to an Instagram post by his son Jed Whedon.

<text>An amphibious transport dock, also called a landing platform dock (LPD), is an amphibious warfare ship, a warship that embarks, transports, and lands elements of a landing force for expeditionary warfare missions. Several navies currently operate this kind of ship. The ships are generally designed to transport troops into a war zone by sea, primarily using landing craft, although invariably they also have the capability to operate transport helicopters.

Amphibious transport docks perform the mission of amphibious transports, amphibious cargo ships, and the older dock landing ships (LSD) by incorporating both a flight deck and a well deck that can be ballasted and deballasted to support landing craft or amphibious vehicles. The main difference between LSDs and LPDs is that while both have helicopter landing decks, the LPD also has hangar facilities for protection and maintenance. In the United States Navy, the newer class of LPD has succeeded the older classes of LSDs, and both the Navy and United States Marine Corps are looking to the LPD to be the basis of their new LX(R) program to replace their LSDs.

<text>Matthew Langford Perry (August 19, 1969 – October 28, 2023) was an American and Canadian actor. He gained international fame for starring as Chandler Bing on the NBC television sitcom &quot;Friends&quot; (1994–2004). Perry also appeared on &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; (2002) and received Primetime Emmy Award nominations for his performances in &quot;The West Wing&quot; (2003) and &quot;The Ron Clark Story&quot; (2006). He played a leading role in the NBC series &quot;Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip&quot; (2006–2007), and also became known for his leading film roles in &quot;Fools Rush In&quot; (1997), &quot;Almost Heroes&quot; (1998), &quot;Three to Tango&quot; (1999), &quot;The Whole Nine Yards&quot; (2000), &quot;Serving Sara&quot; (2002), &quot;The Whole Ten Yards&quot; (2004), and &quot;17 Again&quot; (2009).

Perry was co-creator, co-writer, executive producer, and star of the ABC sitcom &quot;Mr. Sunshine&quot;, which ran from February to April 2011. In August 2012, he starred as sportscaster Ryan King on the NBC sitcom &quot;Go On&quot;. He co-developed and starred in a revival of the CBS sitcom &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; portraying Oscar Madison from 2015 to 2017. He had recurring roles in the legal dramas &quot;The Good Wife&quot; (2012–2013), and &quot;The Good Fight&quot; (2017). Perry portrayed Ted Kennedy in &quot;The Kennedys: After Camelot&quot; (2017) and appeared as himself in his final television appearance, &quot;&quot; (2021). He voiced Benny in the video game &quot;&quot; (2010).

For most of his life, Perry suffered from severe addictions to drugs and alcohol. Through his recovery, he became an advocate for rehabilitation and a spokesperson for the National Association of Drug Court Professionals. In 2013, Perry received the Champion of Recovery Award from the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. In 2022, he released his memoir, &quot;Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing&quot;. 

In 2023, Perry died from the acute effects of ketamine use. Five people were charged in connection with helping him acquire lethal doses of the drug.

==Early life and education==
Matthew Langford Perry was born in Williamstown, Massachusetts, on August 19, 1969. His mother, Suzanne Marie Morrison (née Langford, born 1948), is a Canadian journalist who was press secretary to Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau. His father, John Bennett Perry (born 1941), is an American actor and former model.

Perry&#x27;s parents separated when he was a year old, and his mother married Canadian broadcast journalist Keith Morrison. Perry was mostly raised by his mother in Ottawa, Ontario, but he also lived briefly in Toronto and Montreal. He attended Rockcliffe Park Public School and Ashbury College, a boarding school in Ottawa. He had four younger maternal half-siblings—Caitlin, Emily, Will, and Madeline—as well as a younger paternal half-sister named Maria. His siblings &quot;would stand and applaud&quot; him for early performances.

By the time he was 10, Perry started misbehaving. He stole money, smoked, let his grades slip, and beat up fellow student and future Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau. Perry later attributed his behavior to his feeling like a family outsider who no longer belonged, once his mother began having children with Morrison. As Perry wrote, &quot;I was so often on the outside looking in, still that kid up in the clouds on a flight to somewhere else, unaccompanied.&quot; At age 14, he began consuming alcohol and, by the time he was 18, was drinking every day. Perry practiced tennis, often for 10 hours per day, and became a top-ranked junior player in Canada with the possibility of a tennis career. But his prospects diminished when he moved from Ottawa, at age 15, to live with his father in Los Angeles, where competition was much tougher.

At 15, Perry began studying acting at the Buckley School, a college-preparatory school in Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, from which he graduated in 1987. While in high school, he took improvisational comedy classes at L.A. Connection in Sherman Oaks.

==Career==
===1979–1993: Early roles===
Perry&#x27;s first credited role was a small part in &quot;240-Robert&quot; in 1979 as a child actor. Shortly after moving to Los Angeles, Perry started auditioning for roles. Perry made guest appearances on &quot;Not Necessarily the News&quot; in 1983, &quot;Charles in Charge&quot; in 1985, and &quot;Silver Spoons&quot; in 1986. In 1987 and 1988, he played Chazz Russell in the TV series &quot;Second Chance&quot; (later called &quot;Boys Will Be Boys&quot;). Perry made his film debut in 1988 with &quot;A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon&quot;. In 1989, he had a three-episode arc on &quot;Growing Pains&quot;, portraying Carol Seaver&#x27;s boyfriend Sandy, who dies in a drunk driving incident.

Perry was cast as a regular on the 1990 CBS sitcom &quot;Sydney&quot;, playing the younger brother of Valerie Bertinelli&#x27;s character. In 1991, he made a guest appearance on &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; as Roger Azarian. Perry played the starring role in the ABC sitcom &quot;Home Free&quot;, which aired in 1993.

===1994–2004: Breakthrough with &quot;Friends&quot;===

Perry&#x27;s commitment to a pilot for a sitcom called &quot;LAX 2194&quot;, set in the baggage handling department of Los Angeles Airport 200 years in the future, initially made him unavailable for a role in another pilot, &quot;Six of One&quot;, later called &quot;Friends&quot;. After the &quot;LAX 2194&quot; pilot fell through, he had the opportunity to read for a part in &quot;Six of One&quot; and was cast as Chandler Bing. At the age of 24, he was the youngest member of the main cast. After making the pilot and while waiting for the show to air, Perry spent the summer of 1993 performing at the Williamstown Theater Festival alongside Gwyneth Paltrow.

&quot;Friends&quot; was hugely successful, and it made Perry an international celebrity. By 2002, he and his co-stars Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, and David Schwimmer were making $1 million per episode. The program earned him an Emmy nomination in 2002 for the Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series award. Perry appeared in films such as &quot;Fools Rush In&quot;, &quot;Almost Heroes&quot;, &quot;Three to Tango&quot;, &quot;The Whole Nine Yards&quot; and its sequel &quot;The Whole Ten Yards&quot;, and &quot;Serving Sara&quot;. In 1995, he and Jennifer Aniston appeared in a 60-minute-long promotional video for Microsoft&#x27;s Windows 95, released on VHS on August 1.

For his performance as Joe Quincy in &quot;The West Wing&quot;, Perry received two Emmy nominations for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series in 2003 and 2004. He appeared as attorney Todd Merrick in two episodes of &quot;Ally McBeal.&quot; In 2004, he made his directorial debut and acted in an episode of the fourth season of the comedy-drama &quot;Scrubs&quot;, an episode which included his father.

===2005–2022: Later work===
Perry starred in the TNT movie &quot;The Ron Clark Story,&quot; which premiered August 13, 2006, and received a Golden Globe and Emmy nomination for his performance. From 2006 to 2007, he appeared in Aaron Sorkin&#x27;s drama &quot;Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip&quot;. Perry played Matt Albie alongside Bradley Whitford&#x27;s Danny Tripp, a writer-director duo brought in to help save a failing sketch show.

In 2006, Perry began filming &quot;Numb&quot;, a film based on a man suffering from depersonalization disorder. The release was postponed several times, but it was finally released on DVD on May 13, 2008. Perry also appeared on stage in London in David Mamet&#x27;s &quot;Sexual Perversity in Chicago&quot;. In 2008, Perry starred in the independent film &quot;Birds of America&quot;. Showtime passed on a pilot called &quot;The End of Steve&quot;, a dark comedy starring, written, and produced by Perry and Peter Tolan.

In 2009, Perry starred in the film &quot;17 Again&quot; playing a 37-year-old man who transforms into his 17-year-old self (Zac Efron) after an accident. The film received mixed reviews and was a box-office success. A review on WRC-TV found Perry miscast in his role, emphasizing the disbelief in Efron growing up to resemble Perry, both physically and behaviorally — a sentiment echoed by other critics.

In 2009, Perry was a guest on &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot;, when he presented Ellen DeGeneres with an Xbox 360 video game console and a copy of the game &quot;Fallout 3&quot;. The gesture led to game studio Obsidian Entertainment casting him in &quot;&quot; as the voice of Benny.

Perry&#x27;s new comedy pilot, &quot;Mr. Sunshine&quot;, based on his original idea for the show, was bought by ABC. He played the lead role as a middle-aged man with an identity crisis. ABC canceled the series after nine episodes in 2011.
In 2012, Perry starred in the NBC comedy series &quot;Go On&quot;, written and produced by former &quot;Friends&quot; writer/producer Scott Silveri. Perry portrayed Ryan King, a sportscaster who tries to move on after the death of his wife through the help of mandatory therapy sessions. In the same year, he guest-starred on the CBS drama &quot;The Good Wife&quot; as attorney Mike Kresteva. He reprised his role in the fourth season in 2013.

In 2014, Perry made his British TV debut in the one-off comedy program &quot;The Dog Thrower&quot;, which aired on May 1 as part of Sky Arts&#x27; &quot;Playhouse Presents&quot;. He portrayed &quot;a charismatic man&quot; who enchanted onlookers by throwing his dog in the air. From 2015 to 2017, Perry starred in, co-wrote, and served as executive producer of a reboot of the sitcom &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; on CBS. He played Oscar Madison opposite Thomas Lennon as Felix Unger.

Perry played the lead role in the world premiere production of his play &quot;The End of Longing&quot;, which opened on February 11, 2016, at the Playhouse Theatre in London. Its limited run proved successful despite mixed reviews. Perry restructured the play and appeared alongside Jennifer Morrison in its second off-Broadway production, which opened at the Lucille Lortel Theatre on June 5, 2017. It closed on July 1 after receiving poor reviews. Years later Perry described the play as &quot;a personal message to the world, an exaggerated form of me as a drunk. I had something important to say to people like me, and to people who love people like me.&quot;

In March 2017, Perry again reprised his role as attorney Mike Kresteva in &quot;The Good Fight&quot;, a sequel show to the CBS drama &quot;The Good Wife&quot;. Later that year, he starred as Ted Kennedy in the mini-series &quot;The Kennedys: After Camelot&quot;.

In May 2021, he participated in the special episode &quot;&quot;. He was meant to have a role in &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Up&quot;, but withdrew in 2020 because of CPR-induced broken ribs. Perry published a memoir, &quot;Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing&quot;, in October 2022. It became a bestseller on both Amazon and &quot;The New York Times&quot; charts.

==Personal life==
Perry held Canadian and American citizenship. He dated Yasmine Bleeth in 1995, Julia Roberts from 1995 to 1996, and Lizzy Caplan from 2006 to 2012. In November 2020, Perry became engaged to literary manager Molly Hurwitz. Their engagement ended in 2021.

Residences owned at some point by Perry included a condo in Sierra Towers purchased from Elton John, a house in Hollywood Hills, a house in Malibu, and a cottage in Pacific Palisades. In 2017, Perry purchased a condo occupying the top floor of The Century in Los Angeles for $20 million, selling it to Nick Molnar for $21.6 million in 2021, who in turn sold it to Rihanna in 2023. In June 2023, Perry purchased a mid-century modern house in Hollywood Hills.

Perry had a perfectionist and obsessive personality, spending many hours perfecting his answering machine message. He also believed in God, with whom he had &quot;a very close relationship&quot;, calling himself &quot;a seeker&quot;.

===Health and addiction===

In his memoirs, Perry wrote that by the age of 14, he had become an alcoholic. He became addicted to Vicodin after a jet ski accident in 1997, and completed a 28-day rehab program at the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation that year. His weight dropped to as he took as many as 55 Vicodin pills per day. In May 2000, at the age of 30, he was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center with alcohol-induced pancreatitis.

While Perry said in 2002 that, although he had made an effort not to drink on the set of &quot;Friends&quot;, he did arrive with extreme hangovers and sometimes would shake or sweat excessively on set. During the later seasons of the series, he was frequently drunk or high on set. His castmates made efforts to help him, even staging an intervention, but were unsuccessful.

In February 2001, Perry paused productions of &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;Serving Sara&quot; for two months so that he could enter in-patient rehabilitation for his addictions to Vicodin, methadone, amphetamines, and alcohol. He said later that, due to his substance use disorder, he had no memory of three years of his work on &quot;Friends&quot;.

In 2018, Perry spent five months in a hospital for a gastrointestinal perforation. During the hospital stay, Perry nearly died after his colon burst from opioid abuse. He spent two weeks in a coma and used a colostomy bag for nine months. Upon being admitted to the hospital, doctors told his family that Perry had a 2% chance of survival. He was connected to an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) machine.

Two years later, while attending rehab in Switzerland, Perry faked pain to get a prescription for 1,800 milligrams of hydrocodone per day and was having daily ketamine infusions. He was given propofol in conjunction with a surgery, which stopped his heart for five minutes. The resulting cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) resulted in eight broken ribs. He paid $175,000 for a private jet to take him to Los Angeles to get more drugs. When doctors there refused, Perry spent another $175,000 to take a private jet back to Switzerland. In 2022, he estimated that he had spent $9 million on his addiction, including 14 stomach surgeries, 15 stays in rehab, and therapy twice a week for 30 years and had attended approximately 6,000 Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.

===Philanthropy and advocacy===
In July 2011, Perry lobbied the United States Congress as a celebrity spokesperson for the National Association of Drug Court Professionals in support of funding for drug courts. He received a Champion of Recovery award in May 2013 from the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy for opening Perry House, a rehab center in his former mansion in Malibu. In 2015, Perry sold the mansion and relocated its services. During the COVID-19 pandemic, he launched an apparel line inspired by &quot;Friends&quot;, with proceeds donated to the World Health Organization&#x27;s COVID-19 relief fund.

==Death==
On October 28, 2023, Perry was found unresponsive in a hot tub at his home in Los Angeles. He was pronounced dead at 4:17pm that day at the age of 54.

On November 3, 2023, Perry&#x27;s funeral was held at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Los Angeles where he was buried. His father, mother, and stepfather attended, as did his five &quot;Friends&quot; co-stars. The Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush song &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up&quot; was played; Perry was enamored with the song and referenced it in signed copies of his autobiography, released in part to help people suffering from depression or addiction issues. Following Perry&#x27;s death, the National Philanthropic Trust established the Matthew Perry Foundation to support people suffering from addiction.

On December 15, 2023, Perry&#x27;s death was revealed to have occurred due to acute effects of ketamine. Other circumstances that contributed to his death included the effects of buprenorphine, drowning, and coronary artery disease. The Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner said in a statement that 

...at the high levels of ketamine found in his post-mortem blood specimens, the main lethal effects would be from both cardiovascular overstimulation and respiratory depression... ...drowning contributes due to the likelihood of submersion into the pool as he lapsed into unconsciousness; coronary artery disease contributes due to exacerbation of ketamine induced myocardial effects on the heart. The ketamine in his system at death could not be from that infusion therapy, since ketamine&#x27;s half-life is 3 to 4 hours, or less. 

Perry had been receiving ketamine-assisted psychotherapy sessions to treat anxiety at the time of his death, his last known session of which having been the week prior to his death. However, the report stated that the therapy could not have resulted in his death. 

In May 2024, an investigation was opened by the Los Angeles Police Department to determine how Perry obtained the high dose of ketamine that caused his death. On August 15, 2024, indictments and charges were filed against five people: Perry&#x27;s personal assistant, two doctors, and two drug dealers (including TV director Erik Fleming), alleging involvement in the distribution of ketamine that caused the death of Perry and one other person. 

Three agreed to plead guilty, with two, Fleming and Perry&#x27;s former assistant Kenneth Iwamasa, having their guilty pleas entered into court soon after being charged; Iwamasa pleaded guilty on August 7, 2024, as did Fleming the following day. During a court hearing on August 30, 2024, it was agreed that former doctor Mark Chavez, who had signed a plea agreement but had not yet officially entered it into court, would have his guilty plea accepted, though he will still not officially plead guilty until a later court appearance. Chavez would have his medical license suspended the next month and would officially plead guilty at a court hearing held on October 2, 2024. 

According to U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada, Perry paid the two doctors $55,000 in cash for ketamine in the two months before his death. Iwamasa admitted to obtaining ketamine for Perry and injecting him with the drug, while Fleming admitted to obtaining the ketamine from the supplier and giving it to Iwamasa for Perry to use. Text messages also revealed that the other doctor, who is currently awaiting trial, would purchase the ketamine from Chavez.

<text>Antonio del Pollaiuolo ( , , ; 17 January 1429/14334 February 1498), also known as Antonio di Jacopo Pollaiuolo or Antonio Pollaiuolo (also spelled Pollaiolo), was an Italian Renaissance painter, sculptor, engraver, and goldsmith, who made important works in all these media, as well as designing works in others, for example vestments, metal embroidery being a medium he worked in at the start of his career.

His most characteristic works in his main media show largely naked male figures in complicated poses of violent action, drawing from classical examples and often centred on a heroic Hercules. He, or possibly his brother, was also an innovative painter of wide landscape backgrounds, perhaps having learnt from Early Netherlandish painting. His two papal tombs were the only monuments to survive the demolition of Old St Peter&#x27;s in the next century and be reconstructed in the present St Peter&#x27;s Basilica.

He very often worked in collaboration with his younger brother Piero del Pollaiuolo (), and distinguishing their contributions to satisfy modern ideas of authorship has proved exceptionally difficult, so that many paintings are just described as by the Pollaiuolo brothers. Contemporaries, and Giorgio Vasari, saw Antonio as by far the more talented, and responsible for the design and main painting of most works, but in recent decades the reputation of Piero has strengthened somewhat, and he is now given sole authorship of, for example, the small &quot;Apollo and Daphne&quot; (1470–1480) by its owner, the National Gallery. At the same time, contemporary references in lists of leading artists, of which there are a number, mostly mention the brothers together, and Vasari&#x27;s &quot;Lives of the Artists&quot; treats them in a single &quot;life&quot;.

According to Kenneth Clark, two factors have reduced his prominence in the modern view of Quattrocento art: the loss of his very large paintings of some of the &quot;Labours of Hercules&quot;, and &quot;a name which looks difficult to pronounce&quot;. In his own day, and for several decades later, his &quot;true position&quot; as &quot;one of the originating forces in the history of European art&quot; was recognised.

==Redistribution of paintings between the brothers==
In recent years there has been a trend among art historians to increase the credit Piero is given for the paintings, led by Aldo Galli, whose &quot;Antonio and Piero Del Pollaiuolo: Silver and Gold, Painting and Bronze&quot; (2014) assigns the actual painting of many works to Piero that had long been given to Antonio, or both brothers. Galli only attributes to Antonio the reduced versions of the two &quot;Labours of Hercules&quot; (Uffizi), the &quot;Dancing Nudes&quot; fresco, and an early altarpiece with the &quot;Elevation of the Magdalen&quot;. At least one of the brothers was influenced by the landscape style of Early Netherlandish painting, and the revisionist school thinks that this was Piero. Attributions of works of sculpture and other media are unaffected.

Vasari began the tradition of stressing the contribution of Antonio rather than Piero to the paintings, which went largely unchallenged until the 20th century, despite suspicions by art historians such as Martin Davies, Director of the National Gallery. In the 21st century a full and partly successful challenge has been mounted, and some attributions changed by owning museums. This article gives the traditional attributions, or follows the owning museums, sometimes noting changes in recent years.

==Biography==
He was born in Florence. The brothers took the nickname &quot;pollaiuolo&quot; meaning &quot;poulterer&quot; in Italian from the trade of their father Jacopo, who sold poultry, &quot;pollaio&quot;. This was a luxury trade at the time, and Jacopo&#x27;s four sons were unlikely all to find room for careers in it. According to Benedetto Dei, the contemporary &quot;fanatical enumerator&quot; of Florentine life, there were only 8 poultry suppliers in Florence in 1472, but 44 goldsmith&#x27;s workshops.

Antonio was the eldest son; the two middle brothers respectively went into poultry (eventually inheriting that business) and goldsmithing. The youngest brother, Piero, was also an artist, apparently only in painting, and he and Antonio very frequently worked together, though their workshops were physically &quot;separate but mutually accessible&quot;. Their work shows both classical influences and an interest in human anatomy; reportedly, the brothers carried out dissections to improve their knowledge of the subject. If so, these would be &quot;among the early Renaissance forays into anatomical research&quot;.

Antonio&#x27;s first trade was goldsmithing and metalworking. Although documentation is probably missing, the statements of many near-contemporaries that he trained in the large workshop of Lorenzo Ghiberti may well be correct. This is not contradicted by the possibility that he was the &quot;Antonio di Jacopo&quot; listed in 1457 as a &quot;lavorante&quot; for Miliani Dei, twin brother of the chronicler and from a long-established goldsmithing family.

Vasari, whose account of the brothers&#x27; &quot;early training contains a number of implausibilities&quot;, says that having decided to move from goldsmithing to painting, his brother gave him his first lessons. Piero was about ten years younger but had trained as a painter from the start. However, this seems unlikely; Andrea del Castagno was a great influence on him, and he may have trained with him, as Piero may have done, or possibly Domenico Veneziano. 
By 1459 Antonio had his own workshop, as a goldsmith and painter, with his practice in sculpture and engraving developing later. In 1464 he signed a lease for well-located premises, on the Via Vaccherrechia opposite the Palazzo Vecchio. They had been previously used by another goldsmith, and so were arranged appropriately; the lease was periodically renewed up to 1493. In the following years apprentices were taken on.

He entered the silk-workers guild in 1466 and married his first wife (eighteen years old) in 1469, with a dowry of over 500 gold florins. That year he began to buy land in the country. in 1472 the two brothers and their father bought a house near their family home in the city, dividing it into three units, apparently for renting.

For over twenty years he had a successful career in Florence, rarely leaving the territory of the Republic of Florence, and by 1489 was described by Jacopo Lanfredini as the best artist in the city (this praise is often wrongly attributed to Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici). But by then a commission for a papal tomb, that of Pope Sixtus IV, St. Peter&#x27;s, had taken him to Rome in 1484, or perhaps a little earlier. Thereafter both brothers seem to have spent most of their time in Rome, but returning to Florence at times.

By the time he had finished the first tomb, in 1493, the next pope had died, and he stayed in Rome to do his tomb as well. After a last visit to Florence in 1496, to put the finishing touches to the work already begun in the sacristy of Santo Spirito, he died in Rome in 1498 as a rich man, having just finished his tomb of Pope Innocent VIII, also in St. Peter&#x27;s. He was buried in the church of San Pietro in Vincoli, where a joint monument was raised to him and his brother, who had died in Rome two years earlier.

His departure for Rome meant that in his last years he avoided the depressing collapse of the Florentine &quot;Golden Age&quot; following the death of Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici in 1492, the occupation by the French in 1494, followed by the brief leadership of Savonarola and continued political instability and military threats.

He had two daughters but no son, though a nephew (b. 1472) worked with him – he is last heard of being rejected by Michelangelo for work on the Tomb of Pope Julius II in 1507. There was some litigation in Florence over the assets Antonio left, in which his widow gave evidence in 1511.

==Painting==
The dating of his work (before he went to Rome) is mostly uncertain, and much of his painting, especially of larger pieces, was apparently done together with his brother. A group of paintings are generally agreed to be relatively early, before about 1466. Contemporaries valued Antonio&#x27;s work far above that of Piero, especially in respect of its &quot;disegno&quot; or drawing, for which Antonio was perhaps generally responsible.

He was early as a significant painter depicting subjects from classical mythology, especially those featuring Hercules, but the surviving examples of these are small paintings for private houses. Both his scriptural and mythological paintings excel in depicting action, with a &quot;fierce air&quot; that was unusual for the period. Such subjects had previously been painted at a similar scale for cassone chests, but Pollaiuolo&#x27;s seem always to have been intended as framed images.

His &quot;Hercules and the Hydra&quot; (c. 1475) and &quot;Hercules and Antaeus&quot; (c. 1478), both now in the Uffizi, are apparently miniature versions of two out of three very large paintings of the &quot;Labours of Hercules&quot; that he did for the &quot;Sala Grande&quot; of the Medici Palace, a large room designed to impress visitors. These were 6 braccia square or high—about 3.5 metres, on cloth, so with over-life size figures; &quot;Hercules and the Nemean lion&quot; was the third. For some fifty years after their completion, these &quot;were amongst the most famous and influential works of their time&quot;, but are now lost, &quot;like nearly every canvas of the date&quot;.

These were done around 1460, very early in his independent career, and must have loudly announced his arrival as a painter to Florence and beyond. They were perhaps commissioned by Piero di Cosimo de&#x27; Medici rather than his father, and were on cloth, still relatively unusual in Florence at this date.

Another early painting, probably from the mid-1460s, is his &quot;David with the Head of Goliath&quot;, now in Berlin. Unlike the most famous &quot;David&quot;s of the period, by Donatello (in both marble and bronze), Verrocchio, or Michelangelo, this lacks any documentary evidence linking it to the Florentine government or the Medici family. David is fully and rather richly dressed, with ermine linings, and appears more as a patrician Florentine than a young shepherd. At 46.2 cm (18.1 in) x 34 cm (13.3 in) it was presumably intended for a domestic setting.

The composition of a banner, documented but now lost, of the Archangel Michael in combat with the devil in the form of a dragon or serpent, is known from a copy, and is enthusiastically described by Vasari. It was done for a confraternity in Arezzo, the biographer&#x27;s home town.
His &quot;Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian&quot;, done with his brother, but probably drawn by Antonio, was painted in 1473–1475 for the Pucci Chapel of the SS. Annunziata. It is his largest and most ambitious surviving work, &quot;a milestone in Renaissance art&quot;, as the first large scale painting where the composition is dictated by the actions of the figures. The six large foreground figures of soldiers are paired in three poses, but seen from different angles. This has the largest of the sweeping landscape backgrounds, with a river winding through, that feature in several paintings.

A fresco frieze of dancing nude figures, in a villa near Florence, perhaps from the 1470s, is in very poor condition, but shows the same interest in extreme body poses as works mentioned above, but this time in a spirit of joy. This was for the Lanfredini family, close allies of the Medici who seem to have been important early patrons of Antonio, willing to put pressure on others to get payments due to him.

There are a number of rather similar head and shoulders portraits in profile of youngish women attributed to one of the brothers, or their workshop.

He often used an unorthodox technique in his panel paintings, applying paint directly to the wood, without the usual ground of gesso. This may be responsible for the paint losses some panels have suffered. His main contribution to Florentine painting lay in his analysis of the human body in movement or under conditions of strain, but he is also important for his pioneering skill interest in depicting wide landscape backgrounds.

==Sculpture==
Artists who were both painters and sculptors were not very uncommon in 15th-century Italy; Andrea del Verrocchio is a near-contemporary example in Florence, with a similar career pattern, beginning as a goldsmith, then working for the Medici and finally leaving the city in 1483. The Florentine guilds were more flexible in this respect than those in many cities.

His brother Piero was not a sculptor, removing the issues over attribution that affect the paintings. As a sculptor Antonio and his workshop worked in bronze, silver, terracotta, plaster and wood, but apparently never in stone. Both his papal tombs have bronze effigies, and a very important early commission was the lower parts of a silver crucifix for the main altar of the Florence Baptistery, and later reliefs for the altar. He also produced a large crucifix with the &quot;corpus&quot; in painted cork, and a parade shield with a relief of Milo of Croton in gilded plaster (Louvre).

A stucco relief with over-life size figures of &quot;Hercules and Cacus&quot; in combat on a wall in the courtyard of the Palazzo Guicciardini in Florence was first published as by a follower of Antonio, a derivation of a design by him, and &quot;since that time extremely few scholars have shown any interest in it&quot;; Aldo Galli and some others believe it to be an original work by Antonio, of about 1465.

He was one of the sculptors who developed the genre of the &quot;table bronze&quot; or small bronze figure for the palaces of the rich. At least three of his were of Hercules, who also figures in several of his paintings. Two small &quot;Hercules&quot; bronzes, now in the Bode Museum in Berlin and the Frick Collection in New York, show the hero standing in a resting pose, but another shows the fight between &quot;Hercules and Antaeus&quot; and &quot;broke all the rules of sculpture&quot; in allowing &quot;the liberty of the figures to move in any direction necessitated by their actions&quot;. This belonged to the Medici family in the 15th century.

Two surviving drawings, one owned and described by Vasari, record his involvement in the long planned by never realized project for an equestrian statue in bronze, as a memorial to Francesco Sforza, Duke of Milan (d. 1466). First his widow, then his son and nephew, successors to his dukedom talked to various sculptors before finally commissioning Leonardo da Vinci in the 1480s. Only a huge clay maquette was ever realized before the French invasion of 1494, during a later phase of which French troops destroyed it.

===Goldsmithing===
Goldsmith work was probably his &quot;primary activity&quot; through most of his career, and perhaps its most profitable aspect, but apart from major church commissions almost nothing clearly attributable has survived, except for the Baptistery crucifix and plaques. This is normal, as secular pieces, and many smaller ones for churches, were nearly always recycled for bullion or remaking over the next few centuries. Because of their value, many lost pieces are documented, in contrast to his smaller paintings, almost all without contemporary documentation.

Large secular commissions, now vanished, include some for the government: in 1472 a ceremonial silver bowl weighing 32 pounds, with a relief &quot;garland of children&quot; inside, and in 1472–1473 an ornamental &quot;display helmet&quot;, silver-gilt with enamels, and topped with a figure of Hercules. This was for presentation to the condottiero Federigo da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino, who the Florentines had hired, and the evidence suggests that Antonio delivered it to Urbino himself. In 1480 the Signoria commissioned a silver washbowl.

In 1476 he made the enamelled handle and sheath for a &quot;bread knife&quot;, for a well-off citizen, and there would have been many small commissions for jewellery, table plate and small fittings. He made the silver-gilt fittings, with enamel roundels, for the treasure binding of the &quot;Paris Petrarch&quot;, a collection of works by Petrarch commissioned by Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici in 1476 (now in Paris, after passing to Charles VIII of France). The damaged enamel roundels show the Muses playing instruments.

===Papal tombs===

Remarkably, the two Pollaiuolo tombs were the only papal monuments to survive the demolition of Old St Peter&#x27;s in the next century and be reconstructed in the present St Peter&#x27;s Basilica; Vasari complained of Bramante&#x27;s disregard for preserving other monuments. This must be partly due to Pollaiuolo&#x27;s reputation and the quality of his work, but both tombs were also unusual and innovative.

Pope Sixtus IV had begun planning for his floor tomb before his death in 1484, including the construction of a new side chapel near the main altar. When the new basilica was built in the next century, it was relocated to the undercroft, perhaps because it took up so much floor space. A recumbent effigy in bronze, unsparing in showing an aged person, and using a death mask, was surrounded by flat low reliefs, with personifications of the &quot;Theological and Cardinal Virtues&quot;, and then larger high relief figures of the Liberal Arts on a sloping zone leading to the base, which was originally of green marble. These are highly classicising, though &quot;of varying quality, betraying some collaboration.&quot; The arts include &quot;Perspective&quot;, holding an astrolabe and an oak branch for Sixtus&#x27;s Della Rovere family.

The inscriptions include: &quot;Opus Antoni Polaioli / Florentini Arg. Auro. / Pict. Aere Clari / An. Do. MCCCCLXXXXIII&quot;&quot;, &quot;The work of Antonio Pollaiuolo of Florence, famous in silver, gold, painting and bronze, AD 1493&quot;.

His second papal tomb, for Pope Innocent VIII, has two bronze effigies, one showing the pope lying dead, and the other showing him enthroned and making a blessing gesture. This was the first pope shown as living on his tomb, though pairs of living and dead figures had been used for other tombs. A figure shown in life was to become very common in later papal tombs. Originally the live figure was the lower, but in 1606 a rearrangement reversed their positions. The live figure holds a representation of the relic of the Holy Lance that the Turkish Sultan had given the papacy during Innocent&#x27;s reign. This, his last work, originally included a self-portrait, now lost, probably in profile.

==Engraving==

He only produced one surviving engraving, the &quot;Battle of the Nude Men&quot;, but both in its size and sophistication this took the Italian print to new levels, and remains one of the most famous prints of the Renaissance. He produced a terracotta relief with a different composition of such a battle; both are mentioned by Vasari, who says he made other engravings, but may have been confused by copies or versions by others.
==Other work==
He designed a set of vestments for the Florence Baptistery in the 1460s, a prestigious commission, with the work being done by specialists. He was still being paid for design work on these in 1480.

His drawings are praised by 15th-century writers, and apparently collected and used as models by other artists. Later, Vasari says he owned some, including designs for an equestrian statue; such a drawing survives in Berlin. Drawings now attributed to his own hand are fewer than they used to be; probably fewer than twenty. Some of these are figure studies, others narrative scenes, and there are two designs, on either side of the same sheet for church metalwork pieces that have not survived. This sheet is actually signed on both sides, it appears by Antonio himself, with &quot;Antonio Pollaiuolo horafo&quot;.

==Signed and dated works==
Antonio neither signed nor dated his paintings; in contrast Piero signed one altarpiece. However, Antonio did include his inscribed name on both his papal tombs, as well as on his single engraving. In these works he was (as was typical at the period) keen to include his &quot;nationality&quot; as a citizen of the Republic of Florence, and sometimes to stress his other skills beyond sculpture.

The engraving is signed: &quot;OPVS ANTONII POLLAIOLI FLORENTINI&quot; (&quot;the work of Antonio Pollaiuolo the Florentine&quot;) on a tablet at left. Signing a print so prominently was unusual at this period. The main inscription on the tomb of Pope Sixtus IV is given above; there are two shorter ones in other parts of the monument: &quot;ANTONIUS POLLAIOLUS FLORENTINUS&quot; and &quot;OPUS ANTONII DE FLORENTIA&quot;.

<doc id="233350" wikidata="Q182964" url="?curid=233350" title="Niels Ryberg Finsen">
<text>Niels Ryberg Finsen (15 December 1860 – 24 September 1904) was a physician and scientist. In 1903, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology &quot;in recognition of his contribution to the treatment of diseases, especially lupus vulgaris, with concentrated light radiation, whereby he has opened a new avenue for medical science.&quot;

==Biography==
Niels Finsen was born in Tórshavn, Faroe Islands, as the second-oldest of four children. His father was , who belonged to an Icelandic family with traditions reaching back to the 10th century, and his mother was Johanne Formann from Falster, Denmark.

The family moved to Tórshavn from Iceland in 1858 when his father was given the position of Landfoged. When Niels was four years old his mother died, and his father married her cousin Birgitte Kirstine Formann, with whom he had six children. In 1871 his father was made &quot;Amtmand&quot; of the Faroe Islands. His father was a member of the Faroese parliament for 12 years, and his older brother Olaf similarly became a member of parliament, for five years, as well as the first mayor of the capital, Tórshavn.
Finsen got his early education in Tórshavn, but in 1874 was sent to the Danish boarding school Herlufsholm, where his older brother Olaf was also a student. Unlike Olaf, Niels had a difficult stay at Herlufsholm, culminating with a statement from the principal which claimed Niels was &quot;a boy of good heart but low skills and energy&quot;. As a consequence of his low grades and difficulties with the Danish language, he was sent to Iceland in 1876 to enroll in his father&#x27;s old school, Lærði skólinn, in Reykjavík. By the time he graduated he was 21 years old and finished 11th out of 15 students.

===Studies in medicine===
In 1882, Finsen moved to Copenhagen to study medicine at the University of Copenhagen, from which he graduated in 1890. Because he had studied in Iceland before moving to Copenhagen to study, he enjoyed privileged admission to Regensen, which is the most prestigious college dormitory in Denmark. Prioritisation of Icelandic and Faroese individuals in the admission process was official Danish government policy that had been put in place in order to integrate the educated elites of its colonies with the university population in Copenhagen. Following graduation, he became a prosector of anatomy at the university. After three years, he quit the post to devote himself fully to his scientific studies. In 1898 Finsen was given a professorship and in 1899 he became a Knight of the Order of Dannebrog.

The was founded in 1896, with Finsen serving as its first director. It was later merged into Copenhagen University Hospital and currently serves as a cancer research laboratory that specializes in proteolysis.

Finsen suffered from Niemann–Pick disease, which inspired him to sunbathe and investigate the effects of light on living things. As a result, Finsen developed a theory of phototherapy, stating that certain wavelengths of light have beneficial medical effects. His most important writings were &quot;Finsen Om Lysets Indvirkninger paa Huden&quot; (&quot;On the effects of light on the skin&quot;), published in 1893 and &quot;Om Anvendelse i Medicinen af koncentrerede kemiske Lysstraaler&quot; (&quot;The use of concentrated chemical light rays in medicine&quot;), published in 1896. The papers were soon translated into both German and French. In later work he researched the effects of sodium chloride, observing the results of a low sodium diet, which he published in 1904 as &quot;En Ophobning af Salt i Organismen&quot; (&quot;An accumulation of salt in the organism&quot;).

Finsen won the Nobel Prize in Physiology in 1903 for his work on phototherapy. He was the first Scandinavian to win the prize and is the only Faroese Nobel Laureate in physiology to date. In 1904, Finsen was awarded the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh.

===Personal life===
Finsen married Ingeborg Balslev (1868–1963) on 29 December 1892.

Finsen&#x27;s health began to fail in the mid-1880s. He had symptoms of heart trouble and suffered from ascites and general weakness. The sickness disabled his body but not his mind, and he continued to work from his wheelchair. He died in Copenhagen on 24 September 1904. Accounts of his funeral can be found at the National Library of Medicine.

==Memorials==
The Finsen Laboratory at Copenhagen University Hospital is named in his honor. Finsensvej in Frederiksberg is also named in his honor and so was the Finsen Power Station, which was located on its north side.

A large memorial to Finsen designed by Rudolph Tegner
was installed next to Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen in 1909. It shows a standing naked man flanked by two kneeling naked women reaching up to the sky, with a third behind his back. The sculpture is entitled &quot;Mod lyset&quot; (Towards the Light), and symbolised Finsen&#x27;s principal scientific theory that sunlight can have healing properties. It is situated on the corner of Blegdamsvej and Nørre Allé.

In Tórshavn there is also a memorial to Finsen and one of the city&#x27;s main streets, Niels Finsens gøta, bears his name. Kommunuskúlin, the old public school in central Tórshavn is rebuilt for student housing with the new name Finsen.

<doc id="233351" wikidata="Q707046" url="?curid=233351" title="Piero del Pollaiuolo">
<text>Piero del Pollaiuolo ( , , ; also spelled Pollaiolo; – by 1496), whose birth name was Piero Benci, was an Italian Renaissance painter from Florence. His older brother, by about ten years, was the artist Antonio del Pollaiuolo and the two frequently worked together. Their work shows both classical influences and an interest in human anatomy; according to Vasari, the brothers carried out dissections to improve their knowledge of the subject (though modern scholars tend to doubt this).
Giorgio Vasari, who wrote several decades after both brothers were dead, includes a joint biography of Antonio and Piero del Pollaiuolo in his &quot;Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects&quot;. Vasari says that Antonio was especially highly regarded for his &quot;disegno&quot; or drawing, and it may be that on shared works he did most of the underdrawing, leaving Piero and their assistants to complete the painting. Vasari began the tradition of stressing the contribution of Antonio rather than Piero to the paintings, which went largely unchallenged until the 20th century, despite suspicions by art historians such as &quot;Crowe and Cavalcaselle&quot; in the late 19th century, and in the 20th Martin Davies, later Director of the National Gallery. In the 21st century a full and partly successful challenge has been mounted, and some attributions changed. 

In recent years there has been a trend among art historians to increase the credit Piero is given for the paintings, led by figures such as Aldo Galli, whose &quot;Antonio and Piero Del Pollaiuolo: Silver and Gold, Painting and Bronze&quot; (2014) assigns the actual painting of many works to Piero that had long been given to Antonio, or both brothers. At least one of the brothers was influenced by the landscape style of Early Netherlandish painting, and the revisionist school thinks that this was Piero.

==Assigning attributions==

Contemporaries regarded Antonio as much the more significant talent; he was also a sculptor, whereas Piero seems only to have painted. They had separate workshops in a shared building. Disentangling their contributions, and those of their assistants, in paintings is difficult, as can be seen from Vasari onwards. Many works are given joint attributions, but others, especially smaller works, are given to a single brother. In some cases these have changed over the years, for example the &quot;Apollo and Daphne&quot; in the National Gallery in London was long attributed to Antonio, but by 2023 is described by the museum as by Piero. Davies, in 1961, noted &quot;The attribution to Antonio, claimed to be a better man than Piero, is little more than a recognition of its high quality&quot;. 

In the traditional distribution of authorship, Piero (and his workshop) was usually given the smaller altarpieces and portraits, with mythological subjects, especially several with Hercules, given to Antonio. One well-known portrait in Berlin, the &quot;Profile Portrait of a Young Lady&quot; has been attributed to both brothers individually, as well as a string of other masters. Piero only signed and dated one painting, his &quot;Coronation of the Virgin&quot; of 1483 in Sant&#x27;Agostino, San Gimignano, while Antonio only signed his most important sculptures, his papal tombs, and his single engraving, the &quot;Battle of the Nude Men&quot;.

A profile portrait of a richly dressed young woman, the Museo Poldi Pezzoli&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of a Young Woman&quot; (c. 1470), is now also regarded by the museum (Aldo Galli&#x27;s base) as by Piero, but in 2005 was &quot;now generally assigned to Antonio&quot;, according to Alison Wright, author of the most recent monograph of the brothers in English. Similar portraits in Berlin, the Uffizi in Florence, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York form a group of four that are typically given the same attribution, but the plainer and more forceful Boston female portrait is separated by many (see below).

A letter by Antonio in 1494 stated that the original, now lost, very large three paintings featuring Hercules done for the Palazzo Medici over thirty years before, were a work of both brothers, the only specific documentation tying Antonio to any work in painting. The miniature versions of two of them that are now in the Uffizi are one pair of traditional attributions to Antonio that Galli accepts. 

In the case of the largest surviving Pollaiuolo painting, the &quot;Saint Sebastian&quot; altarpiece now in London, differences in quality within the large painted area have always been noted by art historians, and traditionally those parts regarded as of top quality were attributed to Antonio, and those less good to Piero or assistants. Galli sees the whole piece as Piero&#x27;s, with his team. 
The situation is not entirely clarified by Piero&#x27;s documented, important and very public commission in 1479 for a set of full-length paintings of the &quot;Seven Virtues&quot; for the Palazzo della Signoria, the seat of government of the Republic of Florence. They were to decorate the room of the &quot;Tribunale della Mercanzia&quot;, the body overseeing all the Guilds of Florence. In the end, and after some public acrimony, &quot;Fortitude&quot; was done by Botticelli and the other six by Piero; all seven are now in the Uffizi (see below). Given the nature of their relationship, some art historians have continued to suggest that Antonio helped Piero with aspects of the paintings, either in the design or the execution. Others are happy to use their style to identify similar works as by Piero&#x27;s workshop.

Aldo Galli&#x27;s redistribution of the paintings does not so much depend on stylistic analysis as a reassessment of early (pre-Vasari) documentary records and comments by early writers such as the &quot;Anonimo Gaddiano&quot; probably from the 1530s and 1540s, so only shortly before Vasari. But one characteristic and unusual feature of some paintings is that they are painted directly onto the wood panel, without the usual careful preparation of glue and gesso. The Boston &quot;Lady&quot; and Uffizi &quot;Galeazzo Maria Sforza&quot; are examples. But this has also been described as a technique used by Antonio, and was used in the &quot;David&quot; in Berlin.

A recently re-attributed &quot;Portrait of a Youth&quot; sold at Sotheby&#x27;s in 2021 for 4,564,200 GBP (6,261,764 USD), the first &quot;fully attributed work&quot; by Piero ever to come to auction. It had previously been attributed to Cosimo Rosselli among others, and with the portrait of Galeazzo Maria Sforza is Piero&#x27;s only known male portrait. The teenage subject is given an almost frontal pose, unusual for the period. The reattribution was supported by Alison Wright and Aldo Galli, among others.

==Biography==
He was born in Florence. The brothers took their nickname from the trade of their father Jacopo, who sold poultry, &quot;pollaio&quot; meaning &quot;hen coop&quot; in Italian, and &quot;pollaiuolo&quot; &quot;poulterer&quot;. This was a luxury trade at the time, and Jacopo&#x27;s four sons were unlikely all to find room for careers in it. According to Benedetto Dei, the contemporary &quot;fanatical enumerator&quot; of Florentine life, there were only 8 poultry suppliers in Florence in 1472, but 44 goldsmith&#x27;s workshops.

Antonio was the eldest son; the two middle brothers respectively went into poultry (eventually inheriting that business) and goldsmithing. The youngest brother was Piero, and he and Antonio very frequently worked together, though their workshops were physically &quot;separate but mutually accessible&quot;.

Piero&#x27;s training is uncertain. The Florentine painter Andrea del Castagno (d. 1457) has been considered as a possible master (sometimes for both brothers) on stylistic grounds and the authority of Vasari, but problems with the dating makes this questioned by many scholars.

In a surviving letter by Antonio of 1494 he says that he and a brother (presumed to be Piero) painted the three huge canvases of three &quot;Labours of Hercules&quot; for the Medici Palace thirty-four years before; these were famous in their time, but are now lost. Art historians think he may have misremembered the date by a year or two. 

According to Francesco Albertini, writing in 1510, he painted a fresco of Saint Christopher six metres high on the facade of San Miniato fra le Torri, near his house; both church and fresco have now disappeared. Albertini gives to Piero alone the &quot;Saint Sebastian&quot; altarpiece now in London, the &quot;Cardinal of Portugal&#x27;s Altarpiece&quot;, and others.

His only signed work, the &quot;Coronation of the Virgin&quot; in San Gimignano, is dated 1483. In about 1484, when he was around 41, he followed Antonio to Rome, and thereafter seems to have spent most of his time there until his death. Not many works are usually allocated to this period. 

The last certain record of him is when he was paid for a now unidentified painting in Pistoia Cathedral in November 1485. It is clear from Antonio&#x27;s will of November 1496 that he was dead by then; otherwise the date and circumstances of his death are unknown. As his tomb is in Rome he is thought to have died there, like Antonio. He had never married, but left an illegitimate daughter called Lisa, whose care was entrusted to Antonio; she later married, with Antonio giving 150 lire to her dowry.

==Style==
The characterisation of his style inevitably depends on which paintings are attributed to him and his workshop. Over a century ago Wilhelm Bode complained of Maud Cruttwell in her monograph on the brothers &quot;it is hardly permissable for Miss Cruttwell to attribute whichever of the paintings pleases her best to Antonio and the rest to Piero&quot;. This was really directed at Bernard Berenson, who Bode saw as Cruttwell&#x27;s mentor, who was especially critical of the few works and elements of works he allowed to Piero. He said in 1903 that the &quot;Coronation of the Virgin&quot; in San Gimignano was &quot;a picture of unalloyed mediocrity, with scarcely a touch of charm to repay the absence of life and vigour&quot;. Frederick Hartt, an enthusiast for Antonio, remarked that &quot;Piero... was a painter—a dull one, judging by his one signed work&quot; (the San Gimignano &quot;Coronation&quot;).

By contrast, Aldo Galli describes it as &quot;a magnificent painting&quot; that &quot;presents ... close stylistic and technical affinities with&quot; other works he attributes to Piero, and others have attributed to Antonio: the six &quot;Virtues&quot;, the &quot;Cardinal of Portugal&#x27;s altarpiece&quot;, and the London &quot;Saint Sebastian&quot;. According to Galli, &quot;What they all have in common is a pronounced taste for precious effects, the highly efficacious imitation of jewels, brocades, velvets, with an illusionistic and tactile treatment based on the extensive and experimental use of oil-based binders (at the height of the reign of tempera in Florence), in open emulation of the Flemish masters. This refulgent pictorial treatment characterizes compositions that are highly studied, always somewhat artificial, populated with rather lanky and awkward figures, often seen with bottom-to-top perspective, with hands and feet that are nervously articulated, somewhat affected, emerging in their aristocratic pallor from silks and velvets studded with rubies and gilded trimmings&quot;.

==Works==
*&quot;Profile Portrait of a Young Woman&quot; (c. 1465) – oil on wood, Berlin, often given to Antonio.
*&quot;Tobias and the Angel&quot; (c. 1465–1470), Turin, given by the museum to both brothers.
*&quot;Cardinal of Portugal&#x27;s altarpiece&quot; (1467–1468) – altarpiece, long given to Antonio. Now Uffizi.
* Seven Virtues, 1469–1470; six painted by Pollaiuolo, all now Uffizi. Documented as by Piero, in terms of the payments.
*:&quot;Charity&quot;
*:&quot;Faith&quot;
*:&quot;Temperance&quot;
*:&quot;Prudence&quot;
*:&quot;Hope&quot;
*:&quot;Justice&quot;
*&quot;Portrait of a Young Woman&quot;, c. 1470, Milan. 
*&quot;Portrait of a Lady&quot;, Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, Boston.
*&quot;Apollo and Daphne&quot;, c. 1470–1480, National Gallery, who in 2023 give it to Piero alone (formerly usually Antonio). 
*&quot;Portrait of Galeazzo Maria Sforza&quot;, 1471, tempera on wood, Uffizi. This was recorded as by Piero in a Palazzo Medici inventory in 1492, and so has always been regarded as by him. It is in poor condition. The turning pose with a hand shown is unusual for Florence at this time, and may have been suggested by the sitter, the Duke of Milan who was very interested in portraiture. 
*&quot;Portrait of a Woman&quot;, c. 1475, Uffizi (who in 2023 still attribute it to Antonio).
*&quot;Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian&quot;, completed 1475, oil on wood, National Gallery, who have long attributed it to both brothers; for Galli it is entirely by Piero and his team. 
*&quot;Coronation of the Virgin&quot; (1483) – altarpiece now in Sant&#x27;Agostino, San Gimignano, Piero&#x27;s only signed and dated work.

<doc id="233353" wikidata="Q3751018" url="?curid=233353" title="Borwein's algorithm">
<text>Borwein&#x27;s algorithm was devised by Jonathan and Peter Borwein to calculate the value of formula_1. This and other algorithms can be found in the book &quot;Pi and the AGM – A Study in Analytic Number Theory and Computational Complexity&quot;.

==Ramanujan–Sato series==

These two are examples of a Ramanujan–Sato series. The related Chudnovsky algorithm uses a discriminant with class number 1.

===Class number 2 (1989)===

Start by setting

:formula_2

Then

:formula_3

Each additional term of the partial sum yields approximately 25 digits.

===Class number 4 (1993)===

Start by setting

: formula_4

Then

: formula_5

Each additional term of the series yields approximately 50 digits.

==Iterative algorithms==

===Quadratic convergence (1984)===

Start by setting

:formula_6

Then iterate

:formula_7

Then &quot;p&quot;&quot;k&quot; converges quadratically to ; that is, each iteration approximately doubles the number of correct digits. The algorithm is &quot;not&quot; self-correcting; each iteration must be performed with the desired number of correct digits for &#x27;s final result.

===Cubic convergence (1991)===

Start by setting

:formula_8

Then iterate

:formula_9

Then &quot;ak&quot; converges cubically to ; that is, each iteration approximately triples the number of correct digits.

===Quartic convergence (1985)===

Start by setting

:formula_10

Then iterate

: formula_11

Then &quot;a&quot;&quot;k&quot; converges quartically against ; that is, each iteration approximately quadruples the number of correct digits. The algorithm is &quot;not&quot; self-correcting; each iteration must be performed with the desired number of correct digits for &#x27;s final result.

One iteration of this algorithm is equivalent to two iterations of the Gauss–Legendre algorithm.
A proof of these algorithms can be found here:

===Quintic convergence===

Start by setting

:formula_12

where formula_13 is the golden ratio. Then iterate

:formula_14

Then ak converges quintically to (that is, each iteration approximately quintuples the number of correct digits), and the following condition holds:

:formula_15

===Nonic convergence===

Start by setting

:formula_16

Then iterate

:formula_17

Then &quot;a&quot;&quot;k&quot; converges nonically to ; that is, each iteration approximately multiplies the number of correct digits by nine.

<text>The concept of ego reduction is predicated on the use of Sigmund Freud&#x27;s concept of the ego to describe the conscious adult self; and broadly describes the deflating of an over-inflated or egotistical sense of oneself - a curtailment of what Iris Murdoch called “the anxious avaricious tentacles of the self”.

Among other contexts, ego reduction has been seen as a goal in Alcoholics Anonymous; as a part of BDSM play, providing a means of entering &quot;subspace&quot;; and as a way of attaining religious humility and freedom from desire in Buddhism.

==Alcoholics Anonymous==
Harry Tiebout saw the surrender of the alcoholic in AA as dependent upon ego reduction, in the twin sense of a relinquishment of personal narcissism, and the development of a new trust in other people.

Tiebout stressed that this was a process that should be applied only to the (over-extended) infantile ego the surviving remnants of an original megalomania that had not been worn away by the normal processes of life.

==Therapy==
While most therapy favours a process of strengthening the ego functions, at the expense of the irrational parts of the mind, a reduction in self-importance and ego is also generally valorised: Robin Skynner for example describing the &#x27;shrink&#x27; as a head-shrinker, and adding that “as our swollen heads get smaller... as people we grow”.

Rational emotive behaviour therapy also favours such ego reduction as a part of extending self-control and confirming personal boundaries.

==Buddhism==
Ego reduction is traditionally seen as the goal of the Buddha&#x27;s teaching.

However, the goal of egolessness (as Buddhist therapists warn) is not to be confused with a mere loss or paralysis of ego functions: it is rather their incorporation &quot;and&quot; transcendence.

<text>Desiderio da Settignano, real name Desiderio de Bartolomeo di Francesco detto Ferro ( 1428 or 1430 – 1464) was an Italian Renaissance sculptor active in north Italy.

==Biography==
He came from a family of stone carvers and stonemasons in Settignano, near Florence. Although his work shows the influence of Donatello, specifically in his use of low reliefs, it is most likely that he received his training in the large Florentine workshop run by Bernardo and Antonio Rossellino. Desiderio matriculated into the Arte dei Maestri di Pietra e Legname, Florence&#x27;s guild of Stone and Woodworkers, in 1453 and shortly thereafter already was supplying cherub head medallions for the frieze running across the front of the Pazzi Chapel in the second cloisteryard of the Basilica of Santa Croce.

It is rather surprising that he would have received such an important commission as the monumental tomb of Carlo Marsuppini so early in his career. Apparently, his design capabilities and sensitivity to the tactile qualities of marble had already been recognized. In composing this wall tomb for the Basilica of Santa Croce, Desiderio relied upon the precedent set only a few years earlier in Bernardo Rossellino&#x27;s Tomb of Leonardo Bruni. This seems quite appropriate since Marsuppini had succeeded Bruni in the position of Florentine State Chancellor and had been mentored by him just as Desiderio had received his training from Bernardo Rossellini. In fact, in his design for the tomb, Desiderio was paying homage to Bernardo&#x27;s example in much the same fashion as Marsuppini did when he had composed the epitaph for the Bruni Tomb. Desiderio took over the essential compositional scheme of an elevated triumphal arch containing a sarcophagus and effigy bier from the Bruni monument but transformed the sobriety of the earlier memorial into a work of heightened decorative fancy. In the Marsuppini tomb, Desiderio placed standing children holding heraldic shields on either side of the sarcophagus, draped long festoons from an ornate candelabra which surmounts the arch of the lunette, and positioned running youths above the pilasters which frame the funeral niche. 

In the niche itself, he ignored the symbolism of the Trinity by using four instead of three panels as the backdrop for the sarcophagus. To increase the visibility of the deceased scholar and statesman, he tilted Marsuppini&#x27;s effigy forward toward the viewer and carved elaborate floral decorations on the rounded corners of the lion-footed sarcophagus. The motifs used are all somewhat classical in inspiration and the total effect is light and charming, even joyous, if somewhat unfocused.

In 1461 he finished a tabernacle intended for installation either in the Sacrament Chapel in San Lorenzo, dedicated to the Medici family saints, Cosmas and Damien, located in the left transept of the church; or, more likely, it was first installed in the main chapel choir. 

For his &quot;Tabernacle of the Sacrament&quot;, Desiderio returned (as he had done earlier for the Marsuppini Tomb) to a prototype originated by his probable master, Bernardo Rossellino. This time, Desiderio found his inspiration in Rossellino&#x27;s c. 1450 tabernacle for the chapel of the Women&#x27;s Hospital of Santa Maria Nuovo (now in San Egidio). What Desiderio produced is unquestionably one of the most decoratively delightful examples of early Renaissance sculpture. The composition consists of a pilaster framed aedicula within which a spatially receding barrel vault leads the eye back to the actual doorway of the sacramental closet. 

In the lunette above is a half-length figure of God/Christ energetically displaying an open book in reference to Revelations 1:8: &quot;I am the Alpha and the Omega; the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord.&quot; Halfway down this illusionary corridor, angels rush in from side passages, their draperies fluttering with the pictorial excitement of Fra Filippo Lippi. 

The aedicula of the tabernacle is surmounted by an elaborately framed lunette that encloses an image of the blessing Christ Child, standing upon the sacramental chalice, flanked by bowing angels. Two more angels, holding tall candelabra, stand in weight-shift pose to either side of the tabernacle. All of this, apparently, rested upon a base containing a relief of the Lamentation, which seems rather out of place in an otherwise festive context. 

Yet this remembrance of Christ&#x27;s Passion is essential to Desiderio&#x27;s iconographic program. The body of Christ forms the base upon which his spiritual body (in the form of the Sacrament) is contained and above which the Benediction is given. Wherever its first location was, the tabernacle was removed in 1677, taken apart and reassembled for use in the Neroni family chapel in the right transept. 

For the Neroni, the sculptural components of the tabernacle were recomposed, with the flanking candelabra angels placed in reverse, in outwardly facing positions. Console blocks were used to support the tabernacle which, in a final Baroque touch, was set against a background of colored marble slabs. More recently, the tabernacle has been relocated to the right side of the nave of San Lorenzo and reconstructed in accordance with what is believed to have been the sculptor&#x27;s original intent, although it is thought that a number of elements have disappeared.
The Lamentation relief provides a fine example of Desiderio&#x27;s talent for low relief carving, but really does not display his mastery of &quot;rilievo schiaccato&quot;, in the execution of which he was second only to Donatello. 

For Desiderio&#x27;s handling of &quot;flattened relief&quot; we must turn to his panel of &quot;Saint Jerome at Prayer in the Desert&quot; (National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC) or his tondo of the &quot;Meeting of Christ and John the Baptist as Youths&quot; (Louvre Museum, Paris). The &quot;Saint Jerome&quot; &quot;comes as close to painting as sculpture can get and the expressive faces of Christ and John in the tondo demonstrate the 15th-century appreciation of Desiderio by Giovanni Santi, the father of Raphael, who spoke of &quot;the dreamy Desiderio, so gentle and beautiful.&quot;

Beyond the Marsuppini tomb and the San Lorenzo tabernacle, little of Desiderio&#x27;s work is documented or dated and a chronological reconstruction of his artistic development is a matter of conjecture based upon stylistic comparisons. The extent of his autograph work has been debated; many works sometimes attributed to him might be better given to assistants, followers, or to his brother Geri, with whom he frequently collaborated.

Desiderio made great contributions in the field of portraiture especially as it came to the representation of children. This was a genre which he practically reinvented, drawing upon Roman examples of the Augustan Age. Such sculptures present their youthful subjects with informality even animation; often with open-mouthed expression, they convey a sense of immediacy. His name has been connected with several marble and wooden female busts. The best of these include the marble bust of Marietta Strozzi in Berlin that projects a soft, ethereal beauty that seems to originate from a marble surface that glows from within the stone.

Throughout his brief career, one of the most telling characteristics of his technique was his unusual ability to give to his sculptures a textural sensuousness that might seem to demand touch: of all Quattrocento sculptors, Desiderio was, perhaps, the most tactile in his appeal. His work displays true understanding for the crystalline luminosity of marble and how a gently polished and modulated surface could produce an inner glow and how Donatello&#x27;s famed &quot;rilievo schiacciato&quot; could be further refined to convey a sense of light softly diffused by its passage through atmosphere. At his best Desiderio da Settignano was a sculptor of soft persuasion and subtle nuances.

According to Vasari, his last work was the painted wooden statue of St. Mary Magdalene, now in Santa Trinita, left unfinished and completed by Benedetto da Maiano after Desiderio&#x27;s death. 

Desiderio da Settignano died in Florence in 1464. The most famous of his pupils was Simone Ferrucci.

Giorgio Vasari includes a biography of Desiderio da Settignano in his &quot;Lives of the Artists&quot;.

<doc id="233369" wikidata="Q214178" url="?curid=233369" title="Nablus">
<text>Nablus ( ; , ) is a Palestinian city in the West Bank, located approximately north of Jerusalem, with a population of 156,906. Located between Mount Ebal and Mount Gerizim, it is the capital of the Nablus Governorate and a commercial and cultural centre of the State of Palestine, home to An-Najah National University, one of the largest Palestinian institutions of higher learning, and the Palestine Stock Exchange. Nablus is under the administration of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).

The modern name of the city can be traced back to the Roman period, when it was named by Roman emperor Vespasian in 72 CE. During the Byzantine period, conflict between the city&#x27;s Samaritan and newer Christian inhabitants peaked in the Samaritan revolts that were eventually suppressed by the Byzantines by 573, which greatly dwindled the Samaritan population of the city. Following the Muslim conquest of the Levant in the 7th century, the city was given its present-day Arabic name of . After the First Crusade, the Crusaders drafted the laws of the Kingdom of Jerusalem in the Council of Nablus, and its Christian, Samaritan, and Muslim inhabitants prospered. The city then came under the control of the Ayyubids and the Mamluk Sultanate. Under the Ottoman Turks, who conquered the city in 1517, Nablus served as the administrative and commercial centre for the surrounding area corresponding to the modern-day northern West Bank.

After the city was captured by British forces during World War I, Nablus was incorporated into Mandatory Palestine in 1922. The 1948 Arab–Israeli War saw the entire West Bank, including Nablus, occupied and annexed by Transjordan. Since the 1967 Arab–Israeli War, the West Bank has been occupied by Israel; since 1995, it has been governed by the Palestinian Authority as part of Area A of the West Bank. Today, the population is predominantly Muslim, with small Christian and Samaritan minorities.

==History==
===Classical antiquity===
 (&#x27;new city of the emperor Flavius&#x27;) was named in 72 CE by the Roman emperor Vespasian and applied to an older Samaritan village, variously called (&#x27;the passage&#x27;) or . Located between Mount Ebal and Mount Gerizim, the new city lay west of the Biblical city of Shechem which was destroyed by the Romans that same year during the First Jewish–Roman War. Holy places at the site of the city&#x27;s founding include Joseph&#x27;s Tomb and Jacob&#x27;s Well. Because of the city&#x27;s strategic geographic position and the abundance of water from nearby springs, Neapolis prospered, accumulating extensive territory, including the former Judean toparchy of Acraba.

Insofar as the hilly topography of the site would allow, the city was built on a Roman grid plan and settled with veterans who fought in the victorious legions and other foreign colonists. In the 2nd century CE, Emperor Hadrian built a grand theater in Neapolis that could seat up to 7,000 people. Coins found in Nablus dating to this period depict Roman military emblems and gods and goddesses of the Greek pantheon such as Zeus, Artemis, Serapis, and Asklepios. Neapolis was entirely pagan at this time. Justin Martyr who was born in the city c. 100 CE, came into contact with Platonism, but not with Christians there. The city flourished until the civil war between Septimius Severus and Pescennius Niger in 198–9 CE. Having sided with Niger, who was defeated, the city was temporarily stripped of its legal privileges by Severus, who designated these to Sebastia instead.

In 244 CE, Philip the Arab transformed Flavius Neapolis into a Roman colony named . It retained this status until the rule of Trebonianus Gallus in 251 CE. The speculates that Christianity was dominant in the 2nd or 3rd century, with some sources positing a later date of 480 CE. It is known for certain that a bishop from Nablus participated in the Council of Nicaea in 325 CE. The presence of Samaritans in the city is attested to in literary and epigraphic evidence dating to the 4th century CE. As yet, there is no evidence attesting to a Jewish presence in ancient Neapolis.

Si&#x27;on suggested that Neapolis was about 900 acres in size during the Byzantine period, making it three times larger than it was when it was first established as a Roman colony. Magen estimates that around 20,000 people lived there during this period.

Conflict among the Christian population of Neapolis emerged in 451. By this time, Neapolis was within the Palaestina Prima province under the rule of the Byzantine Empire. The tension was a result of Monophysite Christian attempts to prevent the return of the Patriarch of Jerusalem, Juvenal, to his episcopal see. However, the conflict did not grow into civil strife.

As tensions among the Christians of Neapolis decreased, tensions between the Christian community and the Samaritans grew dramatically. In 484, the city became the site of a deadly encounter between the two groups, provoked by rumors that the Christians intended to transfer the remains of Aaron&#x27;s sons and grandsons Eleazar, Ithamar and Phinehas. Samaritans reacted by entering the cathedral of Neapolis, killing the Christians inside and severing the fingers of the bishop Terebinthus. Terebinthus then fled to Constantinople, requesting an army garrison to prevent further attacks. As a result of the revolt, the Byzantine emperor Zeno erected a church dedicated to Mary on Mount Gerizim. He also forbade the Samaritans to travel to the mountain to celebrate their religious ceremonies, and expropriated their synagogue there. These actions by the emperor fueled Samaritan anger towards the Christians further.

Thus, the Samaritans rebelled again under the rule of emperor Anastasius I, reoccupying Mount Gerizim, which was subsequently reconquered by the Byzantine governor of Edessa, Procopius. A third Samaritan revolt which took place under the leadership of Julianus ben Sabar in 529 was perhaps the most violent. Neapolis&#x27; bishop Ammonas was murdered and the city&#x27;s priests were hacked into pieces and then burned together with the relics of saints. The forces of Emperor Justinian I were sent in to quell the revolt, which ended with the slaughter of the majority of the Samaritan population in the city.

===Early Muslim period===

Neapolis, along with most of Palestine, was conquered by the Muslims under Khalid ibn al-Walid, a general of the Rashidun army of Umar ibn al-Khattab, in 636 after the Battle of Yarmouk. The city&#x27;s name was retained in its Arabicized form, . The town prevailed as an important trade center during the centuries of Islamic Arab rule under the Umayyad, Abbasid and Fatimid dynasties.

Under Muslim rule, Nablus contained a diverse population of Arabs and Persians, Muslims, Samaritans, Christians and Jews. In the 9th century CE, Al-Yaqubi reported that Nablus had a mixed population of Arabs, Ajam (Non-Arabs), and Samaritans. In the 10th century, the Arab geographer al-Muqaddasi, described it as abundant of olive trees, with a large marketplace, a finely paved Great Mosque, houses built of stone, a stream running through the center of the city, and notable mills. He also noted that it was nicknamed &quot;Little Damascus.&quot; At the time, the linen produced in Nablus was well known throughout the Old World.

===Crusader period===

The city was captured by Crusaders in 1099, under the command of Prince Tancred, and renamed &quot;Naples&quot;. Though the Crusaders extorted many supplies from the population for their troops who were en route to Jerusalem, they did not sack the city, presumably because of the large Christian population there. Nablus became part of the royal domain of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The Muslim, Eastern Orthodox Christian, and Samaritan populations remained in the city and were joined by some Crusaders who settled therein to take advantage of the city&#x27;s abundant resources. In 1120, the Crusaders convened the Council of Nablus out of which was issued the first written laws for the kingdom. They converted the Samaritan synagogue in Nablus into a church. The Samaritan community built a new synagogue in the 1130s. In 1137, Arab and Turkish troops stationed in Damascus raided Nablus, killing many Christians and burning down the city&#x27;s churches. However, they were unsuccessful in retaking the city. Queen Melisende of Jerusalem resided in Nablus from 1150 to 1161, after she was granted control over the city in order to resolve a dispute with her son Baldwin III. Crusaders began building Christian institutions in Nablus, including a church dedicated to the Passion and Resurrection of Jesus, and in 1170 they erected a hospice for pilgrims.

===Ayyubid and Mamluk rule===

Crusader rule came to an end in 1187, when the Ayyubids led by Saladin captured the city. According to a liturgical manuscript in Syriac, Latin Christians fled Nablus, but the original Eastern Orthodox Christian inhabitants remained. Syrian geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi (1179–1229), wrote that Ayyubid Nablus was a &quot;celebrated city in Filastin (Palestine)... having wide lands and a fine district.&quot; He also mentions the large Samaritan population in the city. After its recapture by the Muslims, the Great Mosque of Nablus, which had become a church under Crusader rule, was restored as a mosque by the Ayyubids, who also built a mausoleum in the old city.
In October 1242, Nablus was raided by the Knights Templar. This was the conclusion of the 1242 campaign season in which the Templars had joined forces with the Ayyubid emir of Kerak, An-Nasir Dawud, against the Mamluks. The Templars raided Nablus in revenge for a previous massacre of Christians by their erstwhile ally An-Nasir Dawud. The attack is reported as a particularly bloody affair lasting for three days, during which the Mosque was burned and many residents of the city, Christians alongside Muslims, were killed or sold in the slave markets of Acre.
The successful raid was widely publicized by the Templars in Europe; it is thought to be depicted in a late 13th-century fresco in the Templar church of San Bevignate, Perugia.

In 1244, the Samaritan synagogue, built in 362 by the high priest Akbon and converted into a church by the Crusaders, was converted into al-Khadra Mosque. Two other Crusader churches became the An-Nasr Mosque and al-Masakim Mosque during that century.

The Mamluk dynasty gained control of Nablus in 1260 and during their reign, they built numerous mosques and schools. Under Mamluk rule, Nablus possessed running water, many Turkish baths and exported olive oil and soap to Egypt, Syria, the Hejaz, several Mediterranean islands, and the Arabian Desert. The city&#x27;s olive oil was also used in the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus. Ibn Battuta, the Arab explorer, visited Nablus in 1355, and described it as a city &quot;full of trees and streams and full of olives.&quot; He noted that the city grew and exported carob jam to Cairo and Damascus.

===Ottoman era===

Nablus came under the rule of the Ottoman Empire in 1517, along with the whole of Palestine. The Ottomans divided Palestine into six (&#x27;districts&#x27;): Safad, Jenin, Jerusalem, Gaza, Ajlun and Nablus, all of which were part of Ottoman Syria. These five were subdistricts of the Vilayet of Damascus. Sanjak Nablus was further subdivided into five (&#x27;subdistricts&#x27;), in addition to the city itself. The Ottomans did not attempt to restructure the political configuration of the region on the local level such that the borders of the were drawn to coincide with the historic strongholds of certain families. Nablus was only one among a number of local centers of power within Jabal Nablus, and its relations with the surrounding villages, such as Beita and Aqraba, were partially mediated by the rural-based chiefs of the . During the 16th century, the population was predominantly Muslim, with Jewish, Samaritan and Christian minorities.

After decades of upheavals and rebellions mounted by Arab tribes in the Middle East, the Ottomans attempted to reassert centralized control over the Arab . In 1657, they sent an expeditionary force led mostly by Arab officers from central Syria to reassert Ottoman authority in Nablus and its hinterland, as part of a broader attempt to established centralized rule throughout the empire at that time. In return for their services, the officers were granted agricultural lands around the villages of Jabal Nablus. The Ottomans, fearing that the new Arab land holders would establish independent bases of power, dispersed the land plots to separate and distant locations within Jabal Nablus to avoid creating contiguous territory controlled by individual clans. Contrary to its centralization purpose, the 1657 campaign allowed the Arab officers to establish their own increasingly autonomous foothold in Nablus. The officers raised their families there and intermarried with the local notables of the area, namely the ulama and merchant families. Without abandoning their nominal military service, they acquired diverse properties to consolidate their presence and income such as soap and pottery factories, bathhouses, agricultural lands, grain mills and, olive and sesame oil presses.

The most influential military family were the Nimrs, who were originally local governors of Homs and Hama&#x27;s rural subdistricts. Other officer families included the Akhrami, Asqalan, Bayram, Jawhari, Khammash, Mir&#x27;i, Shafi, Sultan and Tamimi families, some of which remained in active service, while some left service for other pursuits. In the years following the 1657 campaign, two other families migrated to Nablus: the Jarrars from Balqa and the Tuqans from northern Syria or Transjordan. The Jarrars came to dominate the hinterland of Nablus, while the Tuqans and Nimrs competed for influence in the town. The former held the post of (&#x27;tax collector, strongman&#x27;) of Nablus longer, though non-consecutively than any other family. The three families maintained their power until the mid-19th century.

In the mid-18th century, Zahir al-Umar, the autonomous Arab ruler of the Galilee became a dominant figure in Palestine. To build up his army, he strove to gain a monopoly over the cotton and olive oil trade of the southern Levant, including Jabal Nablus, which was a major producer of both crops. In 1771, during the Egyptian Mamluk invasion of Syria, Zahir aligned himself with the Mamluks and besieged Nablus, but did not succeed in taking the city. In 1773, he tried again without success. Nevertheless, from a political perspective, the sieges led to a decline in the importance of the city in favor of Acre. Zahir&#x27;s successor, Jezzar Pasha, maintained Acre&#x27;s dominance over Nablus. After his reign ended in 1804, Nablus regained its autonomy, and the Tuqans, who represented a principal opposing force, rose to power.

===Egyptian rule and Ottoman revival===
In 1831–32 Khedivate Egypt, then led by Muhammad Ali, conquered Palestine from the Ottomans. A policy of conscription and new taxation was instituted which led to a revolt organized by the (notables) of Nablus, Hebron and the Jerusalem–Jaffa area. In May 1834, Qasim al-Ahmad—the chief of the Jamma&#x27;in —rallied the rural sheikhs and (peasants) of Jabal Nablus and launched a revolt against Governor Ibrahim Pasha, in protest at conscription orders, among other new policies. The leaders of Nablus and its hinterland sent thousands of rebels to attack Jerusalem, the center of government authority in Palestine, aided by the Abu Ghosh clan, and they conquered the city on 31 May. However, they were later defeated by Ibrahim Pasha&#x27;s forces the next month. Ibrahim then forced the heads of the Jabal Nablus clans to leave for nearby villages. By the end of August, the countrywide revolt had been suppressed and Qasim was executed.

Egyptian rule in Palestine resulted in the destruction of Acre and thus, the political importance of Nablus was further elevated. The Ottomans wrested back control of Palestine from Egypt in 1840–41. However, the Arraba-based Abd al-Hadi clan which rose to prominence under Egyptian rule for supporting Ibrahim Pasha, continued its political dominance in Jabal Nablus.

Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, Nablus was the principal trade and manufacturing center in Ottoman Syria. Its economic activity and regional leadership position surpassed that of Jerusalem and the coastal cities of Jaffa and Acre. Olive oil was the primary product of Nablus and aided other related industries such as soap-making and basket weaving. It was also the largest producer of cotton in the Levant, topping the production of northern cities such as Damascus. Jabal Nablus enjoyed a greater degree of autonomy than other under Ottoman control, probably because the city was the capital of a hilly region, in which there were no &quot;foreigners&quot; who held any military or bureaucratic posts. Thus, Nablus remained outside the direct &quot;supervision&quot; of the Ottoman government, according to historian Beshara Doumani.

===World War I and British Mandate===

Between 19 September and 25 September 1918, in the last months of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of the First World War the Battle of Nablus took place, together with the Battle of Sharon during the set piece Battle of Megiddo. Fighting took place in the Judean Hills where the British Empire&#x27;s XX Corps and Royal Flying Corps attacked the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s Yildirim Army Group&#x27;s Seventh Army which held a defensive position in front of Nablus, and which the Eighth Army had attempted to retreat to, in vain.

The 1927 Jericho earthquake destroyed many of the Nablus&#x27; historic buildings, including the An-Nasr Mosque. Though they were subsequently rebuilt by Haj Amin al-Husayni&#x27;s Supreme Muslim Council in the mid-1930s, their previous &quot;picturesque&quot; character was lost. During the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine, the British authorities demolished buildings in the Old City quarter of Qaryun suspected of harboring insurgents or hiding weapons. Jewish immigration did not significantly impact the demographic composition of Nablus, and it was slated for inclusion in the Arab state envisioned by the United Nations General Assembly&#x27;s 1947 partition plan for Palestine.

===Jordanian period===
During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Nablus came under Jordanian control. Thousands of Palestinian refugees fleeing from areas captured by Israeli forces arrived in Nablus, settling in refugee camps in and around the city. Its population doubled, and the influx of refugees put a heavy strain on the city&#x27;s resources. Three such camps still located within the city limits today are Ein Beit al-Ma&#x27;, Balata and Askar. During the Jordanian period, the adjacent villages of Rafidia, Balata al-Balad, al-Juneid and Askar were annexed to the Nablus municipality. Nablus was annexed by Jordan in 1950.

===Israeli period===

The 1967 Six-Day War ended in the Israeli occupation of Nablus. Many Israeli settlements were built around Nablus during the 1980s and early 1990s. The restrictions placed on Nablus during the First Intifada were met by a back-to-the-land movement to secure self-sufficiency, and had a notable outcome in boosting local agricultural production.

In 1976, Bassam Shakaa was elected mayor. On 2 June 1980, he survived an assassination attempt by the Jewish Underground, considered a terrorist group by Israel, which resulted in Shakaa losing both his legs. In the spring of 1982, the Israeli administration removed him from office and installed an army officer who ran the city for the following three and a half years.

On 29 July 1985, the Israeli army imposed a 5-day curfew on the city that was lifted 2 hours a day The curfew was in response to the murder of two Israeli teachers on 21 July near Jenin and the killing of another Israeli on 30 July. Najah University was closed for 2 months for hanging PLO propaganda posters.

In January 1986, the Israeli administration ended with the appointment of Zafer al-Masri as mayor. A popular leader of the Nablus Chamber of Commerce al-Masri began a program of improvements in the town. Despite maintaining that he would have nothing to do with Israeli autonomy plans he was assassinated on 2 March 1986. The assassination was widely believed to be the work of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.

On 18 June 1989 Salah el Bah&#x27;sh, aged 17, was shot dead by an Israeli soldier whilst walking through the Nablus Casbah. Witnesses told B&#x27;Tselem, the Israeli Human Rights group, that he was shot in the chest at close range after not responding to a soldier shouting &quot;Ta&#x27;amod&quot; (Halt!). The army indicated that an investigation was being carried out. B&#x27;Tselem understood that the victim was killed by a rubber bullet.

===Palestinian control===

Jurisdiction over the city was handed over to the Palestinian National Authority on 12 December 1995, as a result of the Oslo Accords Interim Agreement on the West Bank. Nablus is surrounded by Israeli settlements and was site of regular clashes with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) during the First Intifada when the local prison was known for torture.
In the 1990s, Nablus was a hub of Palestinian nationalist activity in the West Bank and when the Second Intifada began, arsonists of Jewish shrines in Nablus were applauded. After the controversy over the Muhammad cartoons in &quot;Jyllands-Posten&quot;, originally published in Denmark in late September 2006, militias kidnapped two foreigners and threatened to kidnap more as a protest. In 2008, Noa Meir, an Israeli military spokeswoman, said Nablus remains &quot;capital of terror&quot; of the West Bank.

From the start of the Second Intifada, which began in September 2000, Nablus became a flash-point of clashes between the IDF and Palestinians. The city has a tradition of political activism, as evinced by its nickname, &quot;jabal al-nar&quot; (Fire Mountain) and, located between two mountains, was closed off at both ends of the valley by Israeli checkpoints. For several years, movements in and out of the city were highly restricted. Nablus produced more suicide bombers than any other city during the Second Intifada. The city and the refugee camps of Balata and Askar constituted the center of &quot;knowhow&quot; for the production and operation of the rockets in the West Bank.

According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, 522 residents of Nablus and surrounding refugee camps, including civilians, were killed and 3,104 injured during IDF military operations from 2000 to 2005. In April 2002, following the Passover massacre—an attack by Palestinian militants that killed 30 Israeli civilians attending a seder dinner at the Park Hotel in Netanya—Israel launched Operation Defensive Shield, a major military operation targeting in particular Nablus and Jenin. At least 80 Palestinians were killed in Nablus during the operation and several houses were destroyed or severely damaged.

The operation also resulted in severe damage to the historic core of the city, with 64 heritage buildings being heavily damaged or destroyed. IDF forces reentered Nablus during Operation Determined Path in June 2002, remaining inside the city until the end of September. Over those three months, there had been more than 70 days of full 24-hour curfews. According to Gush Shalom, IDF bulldozers damaged the al-Khadra Mosque, the Great Mosque, the al-Satoon Mosque and the Greek Orthodox Church in 2002. Some 60 houses were destroyed, and parts of the stone-paving in the old city were damaged. The al-Shifa &quot;hammam&quot; was hit by three rockets from Apache helicopters. The eastern entrance of the Khan al-Wikala (old market) and three soap factories were destroyed in F-16 bombings. The cost of the damage was estimated at $80 million US.

In August 2016, the Old City of Nablus became a site of fierce clashes between a militant group vs Palestinian police. On 18 August, two Palestinian Police servicemen were killed in the city. Shortly after the raid of police on the suspected areas in the Old City deteriorated into a gun battle, in which three armed militia men were killed, including one killed by beating following his arrest. The person beaten to death was the suspected “mastermind” behind the August 18 shooting - Ahmed Izz Halaweh, a senior member of the armed wing of the Fatah movement the al-Aqsa Martyrs&#x27; Brigades. His death was branded by the UN and Palestinian factions as a part of “extrajudicial executions.” A widespread manhunt for multiple gunmen was initiated by the police as a result, concluding with the arrest of one suspect Salah al-Kurdi on 25 August.

==Geography==
Nablus lies in a strategic position at a junction between two ancient commercial roads; one linking the Sharon coastal plain to the Jordan valley, the other linking Nablus to the Galilee in the north, and the biblical Judea to the south through the mountains. The city stands at an elevation of around above sea level, in a narrow valley running roughly east–west between two mountains: Mount Ebal, the northern mountain, is the taller peak at , while Mount Gerizim, the southern mountain, is high.

Nablus is located east of Tel Aviv, Israel, west of Amman, Jordan and north of Jerusalem. Nearby cities and towns include Huwara and Aqraba to the south, Beit Furik to the southeast, Tammun to the northeast, Asira ash-Shamaliya to the north and Kafr Qaddum and Tell to the west.

===Old City===

In the center of Nablus lies the old city, composed of six major quarters: Yasmina, Gharb, Qaryun, Aqaba, Qaysariyya, and Habala. Habala is the largest quarter and its population growth led to the development of two smaller neighborhoods: al-Arda and Tal al-Kreim. The old city is densely populated and prominent families include the Nimrs, Tuqans, and Abd al-Hadis. The large fortress-like compound of the Abd al-Hadi Palace built in the 19th century is located in Qaryun. The Nimr Hall and the Tuqan Palace are located in the center of the old city. There are several mosques in the Old City: the Great Mosque of Nablus, An-Nasr Mosque, al-Tina Mosque, al-Khadra Mosque, Hanbali Mosque, al-Anbia Mosque, Ajaj Mosque and others.

There are six (Turkish baths) in the Old City, the most prominent of them being al-Shifa and al-Hana. Al-Shifa was built by the Tuqans in 1624. Al-Hana in Yasmina was the last &quot;hamaam&quot; built in the city in the 19th century. It was closed in 1928 but restored and reopened in 1994. Several leather tanneries, &quot;souks&quot;, pottery and textile workshops line the Old City streets. Also located in the Old City is the 15th-century Khan al-Tujjar caravanserai and the Manara Clock Tower, built in 1906.
===Climate===
The relatively temperate Mediterranean climate brings hot, dry summers and cool, rainy winters to Nablus. Spring arrives around March–April and the hottest months in Nablus are July and August with the average high being . The coldest month is January with temperatures usually at . Rain generally falls between October and March, with annual precipitation rates being approximately .

==Demographics==
In 1596, the population consisted of 806 Muslim households, 20 Samaritan households, 18 Christian households, and 15 Jewish households. Local Ottoman authorities recorded a population of around 20,000 residents in Nablus in 1849. In 1867 American visitors found the town to have a population of 4,000 &#x27;the chief part of whom are Mohammedans&#x27;, with some Jews and Christians and &#x27;about 150 Samaritans&#x27;. In the 1922 British census of Palestine, there were a total of 15,947 inhabitants (15,238 Muslims, 544 Christians, 147 Samaritans, 16 Jews, and two Druze). Population continued to grow, rising to 17,189 (16,483 Muslims, 533 Christians, 160 Samaritans, seven Druze, and six Jews) at the 1931 census of Palestine with 309 in nearby suburbs (225 Muslims and 84 Christians).

The 1938 village statistics show a further increase to 19,200. The 1945 village statistics list the population as 23,250 (22,360 Muslims, 680 Christians, and 120 &quot;other&quot;).

According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), Nablus had a population of 126,132 in 2007. In the PCBS&#x27;s 1997 census, the city had a population of 100,034, including 23,397 refugees, accounting for about 24% of the city&#x27;s residents. Nablus&#x27; Old City had a population of 12,000 in 2006. The population of Nablus city comprises 40% of its governorate&#x27;s inhabitants.

Approximately half of population is under 20 years old. In 1997, the age distribution of the city&#x27;s inhabitants was 28.4% under the age of 10, 20.8% from 10 to 19, 17.7% from 20 to 29, 18% from 30 to 44, 11.1% from 45 to 64 and 3.7% above the age of 65. The gender distribution was 50,945 males (50.92%) and 49,089 females (49.07%).

===Religion===
In 891 CE, during the early centuries of Islamic rule, Nablus had a religiously diverse population of Samaritans, Muslims and Christians. Arab geographer Al-Dimashqi, recorded that under the rule of the Mamluk Dynasty (Muslim Dynasty based in Egypt), local Muslims, Samaritans, Orthodox Christians, Catholics and Jews populated the city. At the 1931 census, the population was counted as 16,483 Muslims, 533 Christians, 6 Jews, 7 Druses and 160 Samaritans. However, this census was taken after the 1929 Palestine riots which drove the Jews out of many majority-Arab cities.

The majority of the inhabitants today are Muslim, but there are small Christian and Samaritan communities as well. Much of the local Palestinian Muslim population of Nablus is believed to be descended from Samaritans who converted to Islam. Certain Nabulsi family names are associated with Samaritan ancestry – Muslimani, Yaish, and Shakshir among others. According to the historian Fayyad Altif, large numbers of Samaritans converted because of persecution and because the monotheistic nature of Islam made it easy for them to accept it.

In 1967, there were about 3,500 Christians of various denominations in Nablus, but that figure dwindled to about 650 in 2008. Of the Christian populace, there are seventy Orthodox Christian families, about thirty Catholic (Roman Catholic and Eastern Melkite Catholic) families and thirty Anglican families. Most Christians used to live in the suburb of Rafidia in the western part of the city.

There are seventeen Islamic monuments and eleven mosques in the Old City. Nine of the mosques were established before the 15th century. In addition to Muslim houses of worship, Nablus contains an Orthodox church dedicated to Saint Justin Martyr, built in 1898, and the ancient Samaritan synagogue, which is still in use.

==Economy==

Beginning in the early 16th century, trade networks connecting Nablus to Damascus and Cairo were supplemented by the establishment of trading posts in the Hejaz and Gulf regions to the south and east, as well as in the Anatolian Peninsula and the Mediterranean islands of Crete and Cyprus. Nablus also developed trade relations with Aleppo, Mosul, and Baghdad. The Ottoman government oversaw the safety and funding of the annual hajj (&quot;qafilat al-hajj&quot;) from Damascus to the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Pilgrimage caravans became a key factor in the fiscal and political relationship between Nablus and the central government. For a brief period in the early 17th century, the governor of Nablus, Farrukh Pasha, was appointed leader of 
the caravan (&quot;amir al-hajj&quot;), and he constructed a large commercial compound in Nablus for that purpose.

In 1882, there were 32 soap factories and 400 looms exporting their products throughout the Middle East. Nablus exported three-fourths of its soap — the city&#x27;s most important commodity—to Cairo by caravan through Gaza and the Sinai Peninsula, and by sea through the ports of Jaffa and Gaza. From Egypt, and particularly from Cairo and Damietta, Nablus merchants imported mainly rice, sugar, and spices, as well as linen, cotton, and wool textiles. Cotton, soap, olive oil, and textiles were exported to Damascus, whence silks, high-quality textiles, copper, and a number luxury items, such as jewellery were imported. Outside the city limits, extensive fields of olive groves, fig and pomegranate orchards and grape vineyards covered the slopes. Crops such as tomatoes, cucumbers, melons and &quot;mulukhiyya&quot; were grown in the fields and grain mills were scattered across central Samaria. Nablus was also the largest producer of cotton in the Levant, producing over of the product by 1837.

Today, Nablus has a bustling modern commercial center with restaurants, and shopping malls. Traditional industries
 such as the production of soap, olive oil, and Palestinian handicrafts continue to operate in Nablus.
 Other industries include furniture production, tile production, stone quarrying, textile manufacturing and leather tanning. The city is widely known for sweets like kunafah, olive oil, soap and ice-cream.

The Vegetable Oil Industry Co. is a Nablus factory that produces olive oil, and vegetable butter which is exported to Jordan. In 2000, the al-Huda Textiles factory in Nablus
produced 500 pieces of clothing daily; however, production dropped to 150–200 pieces in 2002. Al-Huda imports textiles from China and exports finished products to Israel. In 2003, there were eight restaurants and four hotels — the largest being al-Qasr and al-Yasmeen. The soap industry has suffered from the West Bank closures and IDF incursions. In 2008, only two soap factories were still open. 

The Al-Arz ice-cream company is the largest of six ice-cream manufacturers in the Palestinian territories. The Nablus business developed from an ice-factory set up by Mohammad Anabtawi in the town centre in 1950. It produces 50 tons a day, and exports to Jordan and Iraq. Most of the ingredients are imported from Israel.

Before 2000, 13.4% of Nablus&#x27; residents worked in Israel, with the figure dropping to 4.7% in 2004. The city&#x27;s manufacturing sector made up 15.7% of the economy in 2004, a drop from 21% in 2000. Since 2000, most of the workforce has been employed in agriculture and local trade. In the wake of the Intifada, unemployment rates rose from 14.2% in 1997 to 60% in 2004. According to an OCHA report in 2008, one of the reasons for the high unemployment was a ring of checkpoints around the city, leading to the relocation of many businesses.

Since the removal of the Hawara roadblock, the casbah has become a vibrant marketplace. Nablus is home to the Palestine Securities Exchange (PSE) and the al-Quds Financial Index, housed in the al-Qasr building in the Rafidia suburb of the city. The PSE&#x27;s first trading session took place on 19 February 1997. In 2007, the capitalization of the PSE topped 3.5 million Jordanian dinars.

==Education==

According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), in 1997, 44,926 were enrolled in schools (41.2% in primary school, 36.2% in secondary school, and 22.6% in high school). About 19.8% of high school students received bachelor diplomas or higher diplomas. In 2006, there were 234 schools and 93,925 students in the Nablus Governorate; 196 schools are run by the Education Ministry of the Palestinian National Authority, 14 by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and 24 are private schools.

Nablus is also home to an-Najah National University, the largest Palestinian university in the West Bank. Founded in 1918 by the an-Najah Nabulsi School, it became a college in 1941 and a university in 1977. An-Najah was closed down by Israeli authorities during the First Intifada, but reopened in 1991. Today, the university has three campuses in Nablus with over 16,500 students and 300 professors. The university&#x27;s faculties include seven in the humanities and nine in the sciences.

Nablus has been ranked as one of the best cities in the Middle East to learn Arabic, with achieving 5th rank in the list. For non-Arabic aspirants, An-Najah University has faculties, providing courses related to Arabic language.

==Healthcare==

There are six hospitals in Nablus, the four major ones being al-Ittihad, St. Lukes, al-Watani (the National) and the Rafidia Surgery Hospital. The latter, located in Rafidia, a suburb in western Nablus, is the largest hospital in the city. Al-Watani Hospital specializes in oncology services. The Anglican St. Lukes hospital was founded in 1900 by the medical missionary Gaskoin Wright; the National Hospital was founded in 1910. In addition to hospitals, Nablus contains the al-Rahma and at-Tadamon clinics, the al-Razi medical center, the Amal Center for Rehabilitation and 68 pharmacies. In addition to that, in 2001, Nablus Speciality Hospital was built, in which it is specialized in open heart surgery, angiograms and angioplasties. Rafidia Surgical Hospital is located in the city.
==Culture and arts==
Nablus and its culture enjoy a certain renown throughout the Palestinian Territories and the Arab world with significant and unique contributions to Palestinian culture, cuisine and costume. &quot;Nabulsi&quot;, meaning &quot;from Nablus&quot;, is used to describe items such as handicrafts (e.g. Nabulsi soap) and food products (e.g. Nabulsi cheese) that are made in Nablus or in the traditional Nablus style.

===Traditional costume===

Nablus costume was of a distinctive style that employed colorful combinations of various fabrics. Because of its position as important trade center with a flourishing &quot;souk&quot; (&quot;market&quot;), in the late 19th century, there was a large choice of fabrics available in the city, from Damascus and Aleppo silk to Manchester cottons and calicos. Similar in construction to the garments worn in the Galilee, both long and short Turkish style jackets were worn over the (&quot;robe&quot;). For daily wear, were often made of white cotton or linen, with a preference for winged sleeves. In the summer, costumes often incorporated interwoven striped bands of red, green and yellow on the front and back, with appliqué and braidwork popularly decorating the &quot;qabbeh&quot; (&quot;square chest piece&quot;).

===Cuisine===

Nablus is one of the Palestinian cities that sustained elite classes, fostering the development of a culture of &quot;high cuisine&quot;, such as that of Damascus or Baghdad. The city is home to a number of food products well known throughout the Levant, the Arab world and the former provinces of the Ottoman Empire.

&quot;Kanafeh&quot; (or Kunafa) is the best known &quot;Nabulsi&quot; sweet. It is made of several fine shreds of pastry noodles with honey-sweetened cheese in the center. The top layer of the pastry is usually dyed orange with food coloring and sprinkled with crushed pistachios. Now made throughout the Middle East, &quot;kanafeh Nabulsi&quot; uses a white-brine cheese called &quot;jibneh Nabulsi&quot;. Boiled sugar is used as a syrup for &quot;kanafeh&quot;.

Other sweets made in Nablus include &quot;baklawa&quot;, &quot;Tamriya&quot;, &quot;mabrumeh&quot; and &quot;ghuraybeh&quot;, a plain pastry made of butter, flour and sugar in an &quot;S&quot;-shape, or shaped as fingers or bracelets.

===Cultural centers===

There are three cultural centers in Nablus. The Child Cultural Center (CCC), founded in 1998 and built in a renovated historic building, operates an art and drawing workshop, a stage for play performances, a music room, a children&#x27;s library and a multimedia lab. The Children Happiness Center (CHC) was also established in 1998. Its main activities include promoting Palestinian culture through social events, &quot;dabke&quot; classes and field trips. In addition to national culture, the CHC has a football and chess team. The Nablus municipal government established its own cultural center in 2003, called the Nablus Municipality Cultural Center (NMCC) aimed at establishing and developing educational facilities.

===Soap production===

Nabulsi soap or &quot;sabon nabulsi&quot; is a type of castile soap produced only in Nablus and made of three primary ingredients: virgin olive oil, water, and a sodium compound. Since the 10th century, Nabulsi soap has enjoyed a reputation for being a fine product, and has been exported across the Arab world and to Europe. Though the number of soap factories decreased from a peak of thirty in the 19th century to only two today, efforts to preserve this important part of Palestinian and Nabulsi cultural heritage continue.

Made in a cube-like shape about tall and wide, the color of Nabulsi soap is like that of &quot;the page of an old book.&quot; The cubes are stamped on the top with the seal of the factory that produces it. The soap&#x27;s sodium compound came from the barilla plant. Prior to the 1860s, in the summertime, the barilla would be placed in towering stacks, burned, and then the ashes and coals would be gathered into sacks, and transported to Nablus from the area of modern-day Jordan in large caravans. In the city, the ashes and coals were pounded into a fine natural alkaline soda powder called . Today, is still used in combination with lime.

==Local government==
The city of Nablus is the &quot;muhfaza&quot; (seat) of the Nablus Governorate, and is governed by a municipal council made up of fifteen elected members, including the mayor.

The two primary political parties in the municipal council are Hamas and Fatah. In the 2005 Palestinian municipal elections, the Reform and Change list representing the Hamas faction won 73.4% of the vote, gaining the majority of the municipal seats (13). Palestine Tomorrow, representing Fatah, gained the remaining two seats with 13.0% of the vote. Other political parties, such as the Palestinian People&#x27;s Party and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine failed to gain any seats in the council, though they each received over 1,000 votes.

Yaish&#x27;s four-year term legally expired in December 2009. While elections in the West Bank were scheduled for 17 July 2010, they were canceled because of Fatah&#x27;s lack of agreement on list of candidates. Nablus was one of the most important municipalities where Fatah failed to resolve internal conflicts that resulted in two competing Fatah lists: one headed by former mayor Ghassan Shakaa and one headed by Amin Makboul.

In the October 2012 municipal elections, Hamas boycotted the polls, protesting the holding of elections while reconciliation efforts with Fatah were at a standstill. Former mayor Ghassan Shakaa, a former local Fatah leader, won the vote as an independent against Fatah member Amin Makboul and another independent candidate.

===Mayors===

Modern mayorship in Nablus began in 1869 with the appointment of Sheikh Mohammad Tuffaha by the Ottoman governor of Syria/Palestine. On 2 July 1980, Bassam Shakaa, then mayor of Nablus, lost both of his legs as a result of a car bombing carried out by Israeli militants affiliated with the Gush Emunim Underground movement.

The current mayor, Adly Yaish, a Hamas member, was arrested by the Israel Defense Forces in May 2007, during Operation Summer Rains, launched in retaliation for the kidnapping of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit by Hamas. Municipal council members Abdel Jabbar Adel Musa &quot;Dweikat&quot;, Majida Fadda, Khulood El-Masri, and Mahdi Hanbali were also arrested. He spent 15 months in prison without being charged.

==Municipal services==

In 1997, 99.7% of Nablus&#x27; 18,003 households were connected to electricity through a public network. Prior to its establishment in 1957, electricity came from private generators. Today, the majority of the inhabitants of 18 nearby towns, in addition to the city&#x27;s inhabitants, are connected to the Nablus network.

The majority of households are connected to a public sewage system (93%), with the remaining 7% connected through cesspits. The sewage system, established n the early 1950s, also connects the refugee camps of Balata, Askar and Ein Beit al-Ma&#x27;. Pipe water is provided for 100% of the city&#x27;s households, primarily through a public network (99.3%), but some residents receive water through a private system (0.7%). The water network was established in 1932 by the British authorities and is fed by water from four nearby wells: Deir Sharaf, Far&#x27;a, al-Badan and Audala.

===Fire department===
Nablus is one of the few cities in the West Bank to have a fire department, which was founded in 1958. At that time, the &quot;fire brigade&quot; (as it was called) was composed of five members and one extinguishing vehicle. In 2007, the department had seventy members and over twenty vehicles. Until 1986, it was responsible for all of the northern West Bank, but today it only covers the Nablus and Tubas Governorates. From 1997 to 2006, Nablus&#x27; fire department extinguished 15,346 fires.

==Transportation==
In the early 20th century, Nablus was the southernmost station of a spur from the Jezreel Valley railway&#x27;s Afula station, itself a spur from the Hejaz railway. The extension of the railway to Nablus was built in 1911–12. During the beginning of the British Mandate, one weekly train was operated from Haifa to Nablus via Afula and Jenin. The railway was destroyed during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, and the route of the line was bisected by the Green Line.

The main Beersheba–Nazareth road running through the middle of the West Bank ends in Nablus, although the thoroughfare of local Arabs is severely restricted. The city was connected to Tulkarm, Qalqilya and Jenin by roads which are now blocked by the Israeli West Bank barrier. From 2000 until 2011, Israel maintained checkpoints such as Huwwara checkpoint which effectively cut off the city, severely curtailing social and economic travel. From January 2002, buses, taxis, trucks and private citizens required a permit from the Israeli military authorities to leave and enter Nablus. Since 2011, there has been a relaxation of travel restrictions and the dismantlement of some checkpoints.

The nearest airport is the Ben Gurion International Airport in Lod, Israel, but because of restrictions governing the entry of Palestinians to Israel, and their lack of access to foreign Embassies to get travel visas, many residents must travel to Amman, Jordan to use the Queen Alia International Airport, which requires passage through a number of checkpoints and the Jordanian border. Taxis are the main form of public transportation within Nablus and the city contains 28 taxi offices and garages.

==Sports==

The Nablus football stadium has a capacity of 8,000. The stadium is home to the city&#x27;s football club al-Ittihad, which is in the main league of the Palestinian Territories. The club participated in the Middle East Mediterranean Scholar Athlete Games in 2000.

<doc id="233370" wikidata="Q7515636" url="?curid=233370" title="Silurian (Doctor Who)">
<text>The Silurians and Sea Devils are two fictional related ancient species created by Malcolm Hulke for the long-running British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. The Silurians are a race of scientifically advanced reptilian humanoids from the dawn of man which first appeared in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in Hulke&#x27;s 1970 serial &quot;Doctor Who and the Silurians&quot;. The two species will foreground the plot of the upcoming &quot;Doctor Who&quot; spin-off series &quot;The War Between the Land and the Sea&quot; (est. 2025) by Russell T Davies.

The ancient amphibious Sea Devils, who are cousins to the Silurians, were subsequently introduced in a sequel to &quot;Doctor Who and the Silurians&quot; titled simply &quot;The Sea Devils&quot; (1972). Both species then reappeared in the 1984 serial &quot;Warriors of the Deep&quot;, which was the final appearance of both races prior to the show&#x27;s cancellation in 1989. Following the show&#x27;s revival in 2005, heavily redesigned Silurans were reintroduced to the series in 2010, and have recurred frequently since then. The Sea Devils were reintroduced in 2022, with their designs mostly unchanged.

Working under producer Terrance Dicks, Hulke came up with the idea of the Silurians to accommodate the show&#x27;s need for more imaginative science fiction storylines during a period when its title character, the Doctor, was confined to present-day Earth. This was necessitated by BBC budget cuts and the growing expense of producing expansive futuristic and alien sets after the show began airing in colour.

Within the series, the name &quot;Silurian&quot; is considered an example of a misnomer; the Silurians were named as such for their supposed origins in Earth&#x27;s &quot;Silurian&quot; period 419 million years ago. The creatures have also been referred to by other names, which have been said to be more scientific, including &quot;Eocenes&quot; and &quot;Earth Reptiles&quot;. The term &quot;Sea Devil&quot;, similarly, appears to be a pejorative term for aquatic Earth Reptiles, albeit widely used. In 2018, the notion of a pre-human intelligent reptilian or amphibious species was explored by the real-life scientists Adam Frank and Gavin Schmidt, who dubbed the concept the &quot;Silurian hypothesis&quot;.

==Creation==

Drawing on the ideas of the Quatermass serials, producer Peter Bryant and producer and script editor Derrick Sherwin decided that for the series&#x27; seventh season, the show&#x27;s protagonist the Doctor should be restricted to contemporary Earth and work alongside the UNIT organisation, featured prominently in the sixth season&#x27;s serial &quot;The Invasion&quot;. Producer Barry Letts and script editor Terrance Dicks, inheriting this new vision for the series, also wanted their stories for the seventh season to have a serious, deeper subtext. They approached Malcolm Hulke, co-writer of the Patrick Troughton serials &quot;The Faceless Ones&quot; (1967) and &quot;The War Games&quot; (1969), to write a serial for this new season.

Hulke saw limitations with this earthbound format – he believed there would be two types of stories, one featuring mad scientists and the other alien invasions. Terrance Dicks claims credit for thinking of the idea of creatures that had been there all along; however, other sources give Hulke credit for deliberately thinking his way outside his earlier preconceptions.

While planning stories for &quot;Doctor Who&quot;″s ninth season, Dicks and Letts decided to revive the Silurian concept, this time with the twist of these new Silurians originating in the sea. Originally dubbed &quot;Sea Silurians&quot;, they were rechristened &quot;Sea Devils&quot; for dramatic effect as Hulke&#x27;s storyline was edited.

Johnny Byrne, writer of the Peter Davison serial &quot;Warriors of the Deep&quot; (1984), notes that the Myrka creature was created to absolve the Silurians from the guilt of genocide, using the creature as a weapon of last resort.

==Appearances==

===Television===
In their first appearance in &quot;Doctor Who and the Silurians&quot; (1970), a group of Silurians are awakened from hibernation by the energy from a nearby nuclear power research center in Derbyshire. The Third Doctor (Jon Pertwee) initially manages to negotiate an honourable compromise with the colony&#x27;s leader. Unfortunately, the colony&#x27;s leader is murdered by a younger Silurian who becomes the new leader, intent on a far more aggressive policy. To that end, the Silurians then attempt to reclaim the planet from humanity by releasing a deadly virus and attempting to disperse the Van Allen radiation belt. Both plans were thwarted by the Doctor. Despite the Doctor&#x27;s best efforts to broker a peaceful solution, the Silurians are still determined to exterminate humanity, only to have their base destroyed by UNIT on the orders of Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart (Nicholas Courtney) to preempt this open threat.

In &quot;The Sea Devils&quot; (1972), an amphibious variety of Silurians are awakened from their hibernation by a renegade Time Lord known as the Master (Roger Delgado), who persuades them to reclaim the planet from the human race. Despite the Third Doctor&#x27;s efforts to convince them otherwise, the Sea Devils eventually decide to go to war, forcing the Doctor to destroy their base. It is revealed, however, that there were many colonies still in hibernation around the world. The land-based Silurians and the &quot;Sea Devils&quot; next appeared, together, in &quot;Warriors of the Deep&quot; (1984), where they attempt again to reclaim Earth from the humans. Set in the year 2084 during a prolonged &quot;cold war&quot; between factions of humanity, the serial describes the Sea Devils as being elite warriors; they sport bulletproof samurai-style armour. The Fifth Doctor (Peter Davison) tries in vain to prevent any bloodshed against either species; he tells companions Tegan Jovanka (Janet Fielding) and Vislor Turlough (Mark Strickson) to give the Silurians oxygen to keep them safe from the hexachromite gas he released into the base&#x27;s atmosphere. The last surviving Silurian in the episode, however, is killed by Turlough, leaving the Doctor despondent.

Silurians are reintroduced to the series, following its cancellation and revival, in the 2010 two-part story, &quot;The Hungry Earth&quot; and &quot;Cold Blood&quot;, in which Silurians are awoken in 2020 by an underground drilling operation. These Silurians lack the third eye of their 1970–1984 counterparts, and wear masks. Having misinterpreted the drilling as a deliberate attack, the Silurians take hostages. After a protracted conflict, the Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith) leaves behind Tony Mack (Robert Pugh) and Nasreen Chaudhry (Meera Syal) in the Silurian city to act as ambassadors to the human race when they re-awaken in a thousand years, despite the race being active again 64 years later in &quot;Warriors of the Deep&quot;.

In &quot;The Pandorica Opens&quot; (2010), some Silurians appear in A.D. 102 alongside various alien enemies of the Doctor (including alien Daleks, Cybermen, Sontarans, Judoon and other species) to imprison the Doctor in the mythical &quot;Pandorica&quot; in order, as they see it, to save the universe from him.

Recurring character Madame Vastra (Neve McIntosh) is then introduced in &quot;A Good Man Goes to War&quot; (2011) as a Silurian detective in the Victorian era, who befriended the Doctor after a brief rampage on the London Underground. She lives with her human wife Jenny Flint (Catrin Stewart), and after &quot;A Good Man&quot;, also employs the Sontaran Strax (Dan Starkey) as her butler. The &quot;Paternoster Gang&quot;, as the three are known, sometimes including the Doctor, appear again in &quot;The Snowmen&quot; (2012) and its three short prequels in 2012–2013, &quot;The Crimson Horror&quot;, &quot;The Name of the Doctor&quot; (both 2013), and &quot;Deep Breath&quot; (2014). In &quot;The Crimson Horror&quot;, Vastra claims to be from 65 million years ago.

Silurians are mentioned in the 2011 &quot;&quot; episode &quot;The Blood Line&quot; (2011); Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) briefly muses that the Blessing (an ancient phenomenon beneath the Earth&#x27;s surface) could be out of &quot;Silurian mythology&quot;.

A Silurian doctor named Malohkeh (Richard Hope) is seen attending to Winston Churchill (Ian McNeice) in &quot;The Wedding of River Song&quot; (2011) in an aborted timeline. Hope plays another Silurian in &quot;Dinosaurs on a Spaceship&quot; (2012), seen briefly on a computer screen. The titular spaceship is a Silurian Ark searching for a new planet with a cargo of dinosaurs, the Silurian colony on board having been ejected from the ship by Solomon (David Bradley) prior to the episode. The ship is shown to have reached a planet named Siluria with its dinosaurs at the episode&#x27;s conclusion.

In &quot;The Time of the Doctor&quot; (2013), many Silurian Arks are seen among the ships gathered round Trenzalore. Sea Devils made their first modern appearance in the 2022 special &quot;Legend of the Sea Devils&quot;, a Thirteenth Doctor (Jodie Whittaker) story. Unlike the Silurians, their appearance and design are mostly unchanged from the original series. They are expected to return in the upcoming spin-off series &quot;The War Between the Land and Sea&quot;.

===Literature===
All of the Silurian stories on television prior to 2010 were novelised. &quot;Doctor Who and the Cave-Monsters&quot; (1974), the novelisation of &quot;Doctor Who and the Silurians&quot;, adds a prologue that features the beginning of the Silurians&#x27; hibernation; the novelisation avoids referring to the reptiles as Silurians. Terrance Dicks&#x27; novelisation of &quot;Warriors of the Deep&quot; (1984) describes Icthar, the sole survivor of the Silurian Triad, as a survivor of the Silurian colony in the caves near the nuclear research facility from &quot;Doctor Who and the Silurians&quot;; according to this book, the Silurians were only sealed away, not destroyed. In Seventh Doctor Virgin New Adventures novel &quot;Blood Heat&quot; (1993), Silurians of an alternate reality have conquered Earth after the Third Doctor was killed in their initial appearance, with the Seventh Doctor eventually forcing the humans and Silurians of this world into a truce. Contradicting the &quot;Warriors of the Deep&quot; novelisation, the novel &quot;The Scales of Injustice&quot; (1996) mentions that Icthar&#x27;s shelter awoke forty years before the events of &quot;Doctor Who and the Silurians&quot;, and that the shelter is located on the other side of the world to the British Isles. In &quot;The Scales of Injustice&quot;, the power-hungry Silurian Auggi plans to eradicate humanity, beginning with an invasion fleet of Silurian hybrids on the Kent coast. UNIT successfully fights off this fleet. The Third Doctor also learns about the Silurians&#x27; battle cruisers and Myrka weapon in this book, both of which appear in &quot;Warriors of the Deep&quot;.

Silurians have also made many minor appearances in the Virgin New Adventures series of novels. By the 26th century, the time of human archaeologist Bernice Summerfield, the term &quot;Earth Reptile&quot; has become popularly used to describe Silurians following their peaceful integration with human society, such as in the novel &quot;Eternity Weeps&quot; (1997). A Silurian short story, &quot;Cold War&quot;, also features in the anthology &quot;Short Trips: Steel Skies&quot; (2003). Additionally, while not appearing in &quot;The Wheel of Ice&quot; (2012), they are mentioned; apparently, the Arkive attempted to lure them to Saturn, but they went into hibernation before this is possible. Madame Vastra also co-stars in the novella &quot;Devil in the Smoke&quot; (2012) and the novel &quot;Silhouette&quot; (2014).

===Comics===
The Silurians also make a number of appearance in comic books. Comic book story &quot;Twilight of the Silurians&quot; (1980) is set during the species&#x27; last days pre-hibernation, where Silurians observe captive &quot;ape-men&quot; in their zoological research station, millions of years ago. The comic book &quot;City of Devils&quot; (1983) features two &quot;Doctor Who&quot; companions, journalist Sarah Jane Smith and robot dog K-9 uncover a hidden city of Silurians (here, &#x27;Eocenes&#x27;) in an Egyptian archaeological dig, who seek peaceful coexistence with humans; this comic strip is based on the premise of the television spin-off special &quot;K9 and Company&quot;. In the story arc &quot;Final Genesis&quot; (1993), an alternate universe is depicted wherein Silurians made peace with humanity and the two races live in harmony; UNIT is renamed URIC, the &#x27;United Races Intelligence Command&#x27;. In the &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; comic strip cycle &quot;The Cybermen&quot; (1994–1996), the cyborg race of Cybermen discover Silurians and Sea Devils living on their own planet Mondas during an unspecified time in the past; in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, Mondas is Earth&#x27;s former &quot;twin planet&quot;. The strip also portrays Golgoth, a primordial humanoid reptile god-figure, who resembles a Sea Devil and may have some link to the Silurians. Madame Vastra co-stars in the &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; comic strip &quot;The Crystal Throne&quot; (2014).

===Audio drama===
Silurians also feature in the Big Finish Productions audio play &quot;Bloodtide&quot; (2001), in which the Sixth Doctor intervenes when Charles Darwin and the HMS &quot;Beagle&quot; expedition encounter a rogue Silurian group in the Galápagos Islands. The audio drama reveals that the leader of this group had been responsible for creating humanity&#x27;s prehistoric ancestors via a forbidden breeding program, sabotaging the Silurian stasis chambers to escape punishment for his actions. In the audio drama &quot;The Poison Seas&quot; (2003), from the &quot;Bernice Summerfield&quot; series of adventures, Summerfield travels to the planet Chosan sometime in the future to assist a colony of Earth Reptiles (Sea Devils) under threat there. In &quot;&quot; (2004), the Silurians attempt to finally make peace with the humans, though the general public believes it to be a stunt involving men in rubber suits. In &quot;&quot; (2005), Silurians aid UNIT in finding a cure for a deadly plague. In 2017, the Silurians appear in the Seventh Doctor audio &quot;The Silurian Candidate&quot;, where the Silurian Triad of 2088 attempt to infiltrate a crucial peace conference by brainwashing one of the participants so that he will kill himself and the other major leader in a manner that would trigger a nuclear war, but the Doctor is able to avert this plan, and instead proposes a new plan where the Silurian colonies will come out of suspended animation millennia in the future after Earth recovers from being ravaged by solar flares (as referenced in &quot;The Ark in Space&quot;), colonies gradually &#x27;waking up&#x27; so that humanity and Silurians will essentially rebuild Earth without either side possessing numerical superiority.

===Outside &quot;Doctor Who&quot;===
Silurians also appear outside &quot;Doctor Who&quot;-related media. A cave drawing of a Silurian and a Sea Devil appear in a cave on Mars in &quot;Scarlet Traces: The Great Game&quot; written by Ian Edginton and drawn by Matt &quot;D&#x27;Israeli&quot; Booker. Silurians and Sea Devils are referenced in the second volume of Alan Moore&#x27;s &quot;League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; where they were connected to the creature from the Black Lagoon; &quot;League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; is set in a fictional universe which reconciles the exploits of different fictional characters in one continuity.

A 2018 journal article published in the &quot;International Journal of Astrobiology&quot;, in which the authors discuss the hypothetical possibility of detecting evidence of ancient industrial civilizations in Earth&#x27;s geologic record, makes reference to the &quot;Silurian hypothesis&quot; in its title.

<text>New World is a New Zealand full-service supermarket chain. Each store is independently owned and operated, and is part of one of two Foodstuffs&#x27; co-operatives. Other independently owned and operated members of the Foodstuffs co-operatives include Pak&#x27;nSave and Four Square stores.

== History ==

Founded in 1963, New World was the first American-style full-service supermarket brand of Foodstuffs, and the second in New Zealand (after Foodtown). As of December 2021, there are more than 140 New World supermarkets across the North and South Islands. New World has been a member of the Fly Buys programme since it started in September 1996.

In early 2003 New World helped introduce Superbank, a completely electronic banking network aimed at saving customers money. While New World Supermarkets had much advertising for the service in their stores, Superbank had no physical services inside the store. In August 2006 it was announced that after heavy losses Superbank would be shut down and have its portfolio sold to GE Capital.

Historically, New World used a coupon saver system. This was replaced in 2014 in South Island stores by the Clubcard system; this was phased into North Island stores in 2016.

==Brands==

===New World===

New World is the brand name of the chain&#x27;s full-service supermarkets, selling groceries and liquor. The first store opened in 1963. There are 142 stores under this brand, including 26 in Auckland.

New World Metro is a brand of smaller supermarkets in central city locations, also selling groceries and liquor. The first store, in Wellington CBD, opened in 2002.

The first store opened in Mairangi Bay in 2017, then others in Mount Albert and Glen Innes. Foodstuffs planned to open ten stores, but the Mount Albert store is the only one still operating until 2023, due to flooding, and in May 2024, A New World in Mount Albert will open.

<text>Local food is food that is produced within a short distance of where it is consumed, often accompanied by a social structure and supply chain different from the large-scale supermarket system.

Local food (or locavore) movements aim to connect food producers and consumers in the same geographic region, to develop more self-reliant and resilient food networks, improve local economies, or to affect the health, environment, community, or society of a particular place. The term has also been extended to include not only the geographic location of supplier and consumer but can also be &quot;defined in terms of social and supply chain characteristics.&quot; For example, local food initiatives often promote sustainable and organic farming practices, although these are not explicitly related to the geographic proximity of producer and consumer.

Local food represents an alternative to the global food model, which often sees food traveling long distances before it reaches the consumer.

== History ==

In the US, the local food movement has been traced to the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, which spawned agricultural subsidies and price supports. The contemporary American movement can be traced back to proposed resolutions to the Society for Nutrition Education&#x27;s 1981 guidelines. In 1994, Chicago pop culture made local food a trend in the Midwest. These largely unsuccessful resolutions encouraged increased local production to slow farmland loss. The program described &quot;sustainable diets&quot; - a term then new to the American public. At the time, the resolutions were met with strong criticism from pro-business institutions, but have had a strong resurgence of backing since 2000.

In 2008, the United States farm bill was revised to emphasise nutrition: &quot;it provides low-income seniors with vouchers for use at local produce markets, and it added more than $1 billion to the fresh fruit and vegetable program, which serves healthy snacks to 3 million low-income children in schools&quot;.

== Definitions ==
No single definition of local food systems exists. The geographic distances between production and consumption varies within the movement. However, the general public recognizes that &quot;local&quot; describes the marketing arrangement (e.g. farmers selling directly to consumers at regional farmers&#x27; markets or to schools). Definitions can be based on political or geographic boundaries, or on food miles. The American Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 states that:

In May 2010 the USDA acknowledged this definition in an informational leaflet.

State definitions of &quot;local&quot; can be included in laws, statutes, regulations, or program materials, however few state laws explicitly define &quot;local&quot; food. Most states use &quot;local&quot; (or similar words like &quot;native&quot;) in food procurement and marketing policies to mean that the food was produced within that state.

The concept of &quot;local&quot; is also seen in terms of ecology, where food production is considered from the perspective of a basic ecological unit defined by its climate, soil, watershed, species and local agrisystems, a unit also called an ecoregion or a foodshed. Similar to watersheds, foodsheds follow the process of where food comes from and where it ends up.

== Contemporary local food markets ==

In America, local food sales were worth $1.2 billion in 2007, more than doubled from $551 million in 1997. There were 5,274 farmers&#x27; markets in 2009, compared to 2,756 in 1998. In 2005, there were 1,144 community-supported agriculture organizations (CSAs). There were 2,095 farm to school programs in 2009. Using metrics such as these, a Vermont-based farm and food advocacy organization, Strolling of the Heifers, publishes the annual Locavore Index, a ranking of the 50 U.S. states plus Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. In the 2016 Index, the three top-ranking states were Vermont, Maine and Oregon, while the three lowest-ranking states were Nevada, Texas and Florida.

Websites now exist that aim to connect people to local food growers. They often include a map where fruit and vegetable growers can pinpoint their location and advertise their produce.

Supermarket chains also participate in the local food scene. In 2008 Walmart announced plans to invest $400 million in locally grown produce. Other chains, like Wegman&#x27;s (a 71-store chain across the northeast), have long cooperated with the local food movement. A recent study led by economist Miguel Gomez found that the supermarket supply chain often did much better in terms of food miles and fuel consumption for each pound compared to farmers markets.

==Local food campaigns==

Local food campaigns have been successful in supporting small local farmers. After declining for more than a century, the number of small farms increased 20% in the six years to 2008, to 1.2 million, according to the Agriculture Department (USDA).

Launched in 2009, North Carolina&#x27;s 10% local food campaign is aimed at stimulating economic development, creating jobs and promoting the state&#x27;s agricultural offerings. The campaign is a partnership between The Center for Environmental Farming Systems (CEFS), with support from N.C. Cooperative Extension and the Golden LEAF Foundation.

In 2017, a campaign was started in Virginia by the Common Grains Alliance mirroring many of the efforts of the North Carolina campaign.

==Motivations for eating local==

Motivations for eating local food include healthier food, environmental benefits, and economic or community benefits. Many local farmers, whom locavores turn to for their source of food, use the crop rotation method when producing their organic crops. This method not only aids in reducing the use of pesticides and pollutants, but also keeps the soil in good condition rather than depleting it. Locavores seek out farmers close to where they live, and this significantly reduces the amount of travel time required for food to get from farm to table. Reducing the travel time makes it possible to transport the crops while they are still fresh, without using chemical preservatives. The combination of local farming techniques and short travel distances makes the food consumed more likely to be fresh, an added benefit.

==Benefits==

===Community===

Local eating can support public objectives. It can promote community interaction by fostering relationships between farmers and consumers. Farmers&#x27; markets can inspire more sociable behavior, encouraging shoppers to visit in groups. 75% of shoppers at farmers&#x27; markets arrived in groups compared to 16% of shoppers at supermarkets. At farmers&#x27; markets, 63% had an interaction with a fellow shopper, and 42% had an interaction with an employee or farmer. More affluent areas tend to have at least some access to local, organic food, whereas low-income communities, which in America often have African American and Hispanic populations, may have little or none, and &quot;are often replete with calorie-dense, low-quality food options&quot;, adding to the obesity crisis.

===Environmental===

Local foods require less energy to store and transport, possibly reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In local or regional food systems it can be easier to trace resource flows and recycle nutrients in that specific region. It can also be a way to preserve open landscapes and support biodiversity locally.

===Economic===
Farmers&#x27; markets create local jobs. In a study in Iowa (Hood 2010), the introduction of 152 farmers&#x27; markets created 576 jobs, a $59.4 million increase in output, and a $17.8 million increase in income. Promoting local food can support local food actors in the food supply chain and create job opportunities.

=== Nutritional ===
Since local foods travel a shorter distance and are often sold directly from producer to consumer, they may not require as much processing or packaging as other foods that need to be transported over long distances. If they are not processed, they may contain fewer added sugars or preservatives. The term &quot;local&quot; is sometimes synonymous with sustainable or organic practices, which can also arguably provide added health benefits.

==Criticism==

=== Food miles ===

Critics of the local foods movement question the fundamental principles behind the push to eat locally. For example, the concept that fewer &quot;food miles&quot; translates to a more sustainable meal has not been supported by major scientific studies. According to a study conducted at Lincoln University in New Zealand: &quot;As a concept, food miles has gained some traction with the popular press and certain groups overseas. However, this debate which only includes the distance food travels is spurious as it does not consider total energy use especially in the production of the product.&quot; The locavore movement has been criticized by Vasile Stănescu, the co-senior editor of the &quot;Critical Animal Studies&quot; book series, as being idealistic and for not actually achieving the environmental benefits of the claim that the reduced food miles decrease the number of gasses emitted. Studies have shown that the amount of gasses saved by local transportation while existing, does not have a significant enough impact to consider it a benefit. Food miles concept does not consider agriculture, which is having contributed the highest when it comes to greenhouse gas emissions. Plus, season and transportation medium also makes a difference.

=== Food choice ===

The only study to date that directly focuses on whether or not a local diet is more helpful in reducing greenhouse gases was conducted by Christopher L. Weber and H. Scott Matthews at Carnegie-Mellon. They concluded that &quot;dietary shift can be a more effective means of lowering an average household&#x27;s food-related climate footprint than &#x27;buying local&#x27;&quot;. An Our World In Data post makes the same point, that food choice is overwhelmingly more important than emissions from transport. However, a 2022 study suggests global food miles emissions are 3.5–7.5 times higher than previously estimated, with transport accounting for about 19% of total food-system emissions,&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1038/s43016-022-00531-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; though shifting towards plant-based diets would still remain substantially more important. The study concludes that &quot;a shift towards plant-based foods must be coupled with more locally produced items, mainly in affluent countries&quot;.

=== Environmental impact ===

Numerous studies have shown that locally and sustainably grown foods release more greenhouse gases than food made in factory farms. The &quot;Land Degradation&quot; section of the United Nations report &quot;Livestock&#x27;s Long Shadow&quot; concludes that &quot;Intensification - in terms of increased productivity both in livestock production and in feed crop agriculture - can reduce greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation&quot;. Nathan Pelletier of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia found that cattle raised on open pastures release 50% more greenhouse gas emissions than cattle raised in factory farms. Adrian Williams of Cranfield University in England found that free range and organic raised chickens have a 20% greater impact on global warming than chickens raised in factory farm conditions, and organic egg production had a 14% higher impact on the climate than factory farm egg production. Studies such as Christopher Weber&#x27;s report on food miles have shown that the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions in production far outweighs those in transportation, which implies that locally grown food is actually worse for the environment than food made in factory farms.

=== Economic feasibility ===

While locavorism has been promoted as a feasible alternative to modern food production, some believe it might negatively affect the efficiency of production. As technological advances have influenced the amount of output of farms, the productivity of farmers has skyrocketed in the last 70 years. These latter criticisms combine with deeper concerns of food safety, cited on the lines of the historical pattern of economic or food safety inefficiencies of subsistence farming which form the topic of the book &quot;The Locavore&#x27;s Dilemma&quot; by geographer Pierre Desrochers and public policy scholar Hiroko Shimizu.

<doc id="233375" wikidata="Q7125339" url="?curid=233375" title="Pak'nSave">
<text>Pak&#x27;nSave (stylised as PAK&#x27;nSAVE) is a New Zealand discount food supermarket warehouse chain owned by the Foodstuffs cooperative. It is one of the three main supermarket chains in New Zealand, alongside Woolworths New Zealand and New World (the latter is also owned by Foodstuffs). There is a total of 58 Pak&#x27;nSave stores throughout the country.

Pak&#x27;nSave stores are large and have a no frills environment, often with unlined interiors and concrete floors.

==History==
Pak&#x27;nSave had 20 stores in 1993, which rose to 30 stores in 1998. Its supermarket market share rose from 8% in 1989 to 24% in 1996.

=== Origins ===
The first Pak&#x27;nSave opened on 12 June 1985 in Kaitaia, a town in the Far North District of the North Island. In the beginning, mutton and candles were the stores best sellers, which is attributed to the fact that many homes in the Far North still did not have power in 1985. Pak&#x27;nSave originally used a system where customers were given a black marker upon entering the store, which would use this to write the prices onto the goods that they were buying, which they would bring to the checkouts. This is because Pak&#x27;nSave at the time did not use barcodes, scanners, or running checkouts, so prices were written onto shelves. Due to the first store&#x27;s popularity in the Far North, Pak&#x27;nSave operated monthly bus trips to the Kaitaia store.

A couple of months after the first store, a second Pak&#x27;nSave store was opened in Henderson. Two days after the store opened, two more checkouts had to be opened because of its popularity.

=== 1990–2020 ===
In the 1992 recession, Pak&#x27;nSave increased its focus on prices.

In 2005, there were 37 stores around New Zealand, including seven in Auckland.

Pak&#x27;nSave started rolling out self checkouts around 2009, where customers would scan, pack and pay for their groceries themselves. Customers would only interact with employees to check IDs for sales of alcohol or cigarettes.

The first Pak&#x27;nSave store, in Kaitaia, went empty in 2011 because Foodstuffs opened a new store in Kaitaia. In 2018 Foodstuffs gave a 50-year lease for $2 to a Youth Centre. As the Youth Centre could not fulfill their plans, demolition of the building was announced in 2022.

Starting in 2017, the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA) provided funding toward Foodstuffs to trial electric delivery vans. Funding also went to electric car chargers for carparks.

In December 2017 Foodstuffs recalled a batch of its Pak&#x27;nSave branded beef mince after concerns that it contained soft plastic.

In August 2018 Pak&#x27;nSave announced that they would stop offering single-use plastic bags by the start of 2019. After they were discontinued, an &#x27;endangered&#x27; bag sold on Trade Me for $52. In February 2020 Pak&#x27;nSave started trialling recycled paper bags for bulk food.

In January 2019 Pak&#x27;nSave announced that they would start rolling out the option to buy products online.

=== COVID-19 pandemic ===

In late February 2020, after the first case of COVID-19 in New Zealand, customers began to panic buy products from supermarkets throughout New Zealand. Due to this, Pak&#x27;nSave put restrictions on purchasing, such as a &quot;one in, one out&quot; queue in Albany, which reached a queue of over 200 people. In Pak&#x27;nSave Wairau, hand sanitiser was restricted to one per customer. During the COVID-19 lockdowns, Pak&#x27;nSave shoppers had to be alone, spend a maximum of 30 minutes in the store, and social distance for two metres. In March, Pak&#x27;nSave Gisborne announced that they had a lane dedicated for elderly customers. In April Pak&#x27;nSave Royal Oak started trialling a car queue system. Customers would text the supermarket and would receive a notification when it was their turn.

Pak&#x27;nSave would turn away customers who were not wearing a face mask. This was a policy of Foodstuffs, meaning that it also affected New World stores. Employees were given gloves and perspex shields were placed on checkouts. Pak&#x27;nSave also rolled out &quot;quaran-tunes&quot; on in store radios, which was music related to physical-distancing, voiced by Pak&#x27;nSave&#x27;s mascot, Stickman. Also during the pandemic, Pak&#x27;nSave temporarily changed their logo. The tagline was changed from &quot;Our Policy: New Zealand&#x27;s Lowest Grocery Prices&quot; to &quot;Our Policy: Keep it Distance-y New Zealand&quot;.

=== 2020–present ===
In October 2020, the Commerce Commission fined Pak&#x27;nSave Māngere $78,000 for making false and/or misleading representations of prices.

In May 2021, forty workers at Pak&#x27;nSave Lincoln Road, which is the largest supermarket in New Zealand, went on strike.

In September 2021, Foodstuffs announced Pak&#x27;nSave and New World would stop selling caged eggs by 2027.

In 2022, Foodstuffs announced that 29 of its North Island stores, including New World and Four Square, had started using facial recognition technology as a measure against crime.

During the 2023 Auckland Anniversary Weekend floods, the Pak&#x27;nSave Wairau Road had to close due to extensive flooding of the store.

In June 2023, Pak&#x27;nSave released an AI app named Savey Meal-bot. It creates meal plans and recipes from ingredients including leftovers given by the app&#x27;s user. The app, made with the GPT-3 language model, sparked controversy when it suggested to a user to make chlorine gas and eat antpoison sandwiches.

In June 2023, a Pak&#x27;nSave in Tauranga started trialling front-facing body cameras due to a rise in retail crime.

In 2023, Pak&#x27;nSave was named New Zealand&#x27;s most trusted brand in a &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; survey. Pak&#x27;nSave had held the title for twelve years in a row, out of the survey&#x27;s 24-year history.

==Operations==

Pak&#x27;nSave is franchised.

Extra products that are not on shelves are stacked above the shelves on the pallets they were delivered in, meaning that the floor space can be used for retail and storage. The stores are supplied daily from their co-operative distributor Foodstuffs.

Most stores have self checkout and some have self scanning facilities where customers scan and bag their own groceries, with several self-checkouts monitored over by a single staff member for assistance and to clear any restricted transactions (e.g. alcohol). Pak&#x27;nSave has self-scanning facilities (Shop n&#x27; Go) where pre-registered customers can scan items with a hand-held scanner (PS20) while shopping in store.

===Pak&#x27;nSave Mini===
On 13 September 2017, Levin&#x27;s Write Price supermarket was re-branded as Pak&#x27;nSave Mini.
Pak&#x27;nSave Mini is a small format store that stocks around 2,500 products. In comparison, standard Pak&#x27;nSave stores stock approximately 8,000 products.

===Competition===
Pak&#x27;nSave&#x27;s main competitors are Woolworths and the also Foodstuffs-owned New World.

=== Shop&#x27;nGo ===
Shop&#x27;nGo is a service where customers are given scanners, which are used to scan products as they shop around the store, which allows them to track the total price. Customers using Shop&#x27;nGo do not need to unload their trolley to pay. They go to a self-checkout, scan a QR on the Shop&#x27;nGo screen, and then pay for the products.

Shop&#x27;nGo started around 2005 in a few stores. In 2020, 11 stores in the South Island rolled out Shop&#x27;nGo.

==Marketing==
Pak&#x27;nSave is well known for its &quot;cut price&quot; television and print adverts utilising a stick figure, named &quot;Stickman&quot;, in black on a yellow background (occasionally, the colour scheme is reversed, including during the 2011 Rugby World Cup and the 2012 Summer Olympics). The television adverts are voiced by comedian Paul Ego. Originally, the voice of Stickman was Ego &quot;mucking around&quot;. Another voice had been recorded but it was the &quot;mucking around&quot; voice which was chosen.

In April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, an Instagram account was created for Stickman. His first post was &quot;Day 1 on Instagram and Day 23 in Lockdown. My bubble is still looking fresh. Just jokes, that&#x27;s my head. #gotyou&quot;. The account has 25,000 followers. In September Pak&#x27;nSave took down an advertisement which pronounced the Māori word Wainoni incorrectly.

In 2011, the Stickman adverts were one of the finalists for Best Ad in the annual &quot;Fair Go&quot; Ad Awards, but lost to the New Zealand Lotteries Commission&#x27;s &quot;Wilson the Dog&quot; adverts.

In December 2022, under the stage name DJ Save-A-LotT, Stickman hosted an hour-long radio show.

==Fuel discounts==

Pak&#x27;nSave offers a program which gives customers a fuel discount for stores with on-site fuel filling stations. To do this, customers scan a &quot;Sticky Club&quot; tag at the checkout and receive a voucher. Stores without on-site Pak&#x27;nSave fuel filling stations offer vouchers for use at Z Energy service stations.

===Fuel sites===
In December 2002, the first Pak&#x27;nSave Fuel site was opened at the Pak&#x27;nSave in Tamatea. It was originally owned by BP New Zealand and Foodstuffs. More fuel sites were opened in more PAK&#x27;nSAVE stores and New World joined for the fuel sites later. In 2018, Z Energy won Mobil&#x27;s contract to operate the fuel sites and fuel vouchers.

== Controversies ==
In 2013 the Commerce Commission said that Pak&#x27;nSave&#x27;s comparative pricing advertisements may be misleading under certain circumstances.

In 2018 Progressive Enterprises, the owner of Countdown, complained to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) about a Pak&#x27;nSave advertisement. It compared prices between Pak&#x27;nSave and Countdown. Progressive said that the advertisement was misleading as no store had the same prices on the day listed in the advertisement. Foodstuffs said that there was a mistake in the date, and said that rather than 7 August 2017, the correct date was 28 September 2017. The same year, vegans complained to the Advertising Standards Authority that an advertisement saying &quot;you&#x27;ll never beat real meat&quot; is offensive to the vegan and vegetarian community. The ASA dismissed the complaint. Again in 2018, a Pak&#x27;nSave advertisement encouraging responsible drinking was described by the Human Rights Commission as &quot;discriminatory and harmful&quot;. It featured men dressed as women purchasing wine, causing human rights advocates to describe the ad as &quot;transphobic&quot;.

In October 2020, the Commerce Commission fined Pak&#x27;nSave Māngere $78,000 for making false and/or misleading representations of prices.

In June 2023, Pak&#x27;nSave released an AI app named Savey Meal-bot. It creates meal plans and recipes from ingredients including leftovers given by the app&#x27;s user. The app, made with the GPT-3 language model, sparked controversy when it suggested to a user to make chlorine gas and eat ant-poison sandwiches.

== Fundraising and charity ==
In early 2023 Pak&#x27;nSave owner operators from across the North Island donated over $575,000 to help communities affected by Cyclone Gabrielle.

Pak&#x27;nSave stores donated the equivalent of 2.5 million meals in 2019 to those who needed them the most. 
The first ever Pak&#x27;canSAVE appeal saw nearly 80,000 cans donated to local food banks by generous customers, with Pak&#x27;nSave donating $200,000.

In November 2015, Pak&#x27;nSave stores participated in the annual Movember fundraising effort, raising NZ$106,000 for Movember New Zealand. This was the largest sum ever raised by a New Zealand company for the charity.

== Consumer perceptions ==
A 2021 study by the Commerce Commission found that consumers consider Pak&#x27;nSave, compared to other supermarkets, as more inexpensive with poorer quality meats and vegetables.

<text>Ernest Preston Manning (born June 10, 1942) is a retired Canadian politician. He was the founder and the only leader of the Reform Party of Canada, a Canadian federal political party that evolved into the Canadian Alliance in 2000 which in turn merged with the Progressive Conservative Party to form today&#x27;s Conservative Party of Canada in 2003. Manning represented the federal constituency of Calgary Southwest in the Canadian House of Commons from 1993 until his retirement in 2002. He served as leader of the Official Opposition from 1997 to 2000.

Manning is the son of former Social Credit Premier of Alberta Ernest Manning. Earning a Bachelor of Arts in economics in 1964, Manning rose to prominence in 1987, when he and an alliance of associates created the Reform Party, an anti-establishment right-wing populist party that won its first seat in 1989 and had a regionalist, Western Canadian base. Shortly after that, the party rapidly gained momentum in the 1993 Canadian federal election, where it won 52 seats. In the 1997 federal election, support increased as the party&#x27;s number of seats rose to 60 and became the Official Opposition, although Manning struggled to win ridings in Central and Atlantic Canada in order to become prime minister. In 2000, the Reform Party was succeeded by the Canadian Alliance. Manning lost the leadership election to Stockwell Day but continued to serve in the federal parliament until his retirement in January 2002.

Manning has been deemed the &quot;father of modern-day Canadian Conservatism&quot;, and remains active in Conservative Party politics and campaigns. Manning is also seen as the founder of the green conservative movement in Canada. Upon his retirement, he has founded the Manning Foundation for Democratic Education and the Manning Centre for Building Democracy, not-for-profit organizations dedicated to strengthening Canadian democracy in accordance with conservative principles.

== Early life and career ==
Manning was born in Edmonton, Alberta. He is the son of Muriel Aileen (née Preston) and Ernest Manning, Social Credit Party Premier of Alberta between 1943 and 1968 and a Canadian Senator from 1970 to 1983. Preston&#x27;s grandparents were English immigrants.

Manning grew up in the Garneau district of Edmonton, but moved at age twelve with his parents to the family dairy farm east of Edmonton from which he attended a rural school – Horse Hill High School. He enrolled in the honours physics program at the University of Alberta in 1960, but switched after three years to economics and graduated in 1964 with a Bachelor of Arts in economics. He sought election to the Canadian House of Commons in the 1965 federal election as a candidate of the federal Social Credit Party in Edmonton East, but was defeated.

When the Prairies began to prosper because of its status as an international wheat basket and the discovery of oil, the Social Credit Party, changed course from its 1930s share-the-wealth roots to embrace rugged individualism and free enterprise. Upon graduation from university in 1966, Manning briefly worked as a salaried researcher for the National Public Affairs Research Foundation—a small, independent think tank led by David R. Wilson, who had been formerly with the Social Credit as executive director. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the focus of the Foundation as fighting &quot;creeping socialism&quot; in Canada. This research enabled Manning to work on quasi political projects of interest to himself and his father. One such project included the preparation of a proposal for re-aligning Alberta provincial politics through a proposed merger of the governing Social Credit Party with the up-and-coming Progressive Conservative Party led by Peter Lougheed. The proposal was ultimately rejected by the leadership of both parties but the statement of conservative principles it contained resurfaced time and time again in Manning&#x27;s subsequent political ventures – in the statement of principles contained in a book researched by him for Ernest Manning entitled in &quot;Political Realignment: A Challenge for Thoughtful Canadians&quot; and in the statements of principles of the Reform Party of Canada, the Canadian Reform Conservative Alliance, and the Conservative Party of Canada.

In 1967, Manning married Sandra (née Beavis). Together they have five children.

Preston Manning has described himself as &quot;a great fan and imperfect follower of Jesus of Nazareth&quot; and has studied and lectured extensively on managing the interface between faith and politics.

Manning and a colleague, Dr. Erick Schmidt, a PhD sociologist and Executive Secretary to the Alberta cabinet in the 1960s, became interested in the General Systems Theory of biologist Ludwig von Bertalanffy and its possible application to governmental and business organizations. Together, Manning and Schmidt authored a &quot;White Paper on Human Resources Development&quot; for the Alberta government applying systems concepts to the reorganization of Alberta&#x27;s social services. It was presented to the Alberta legislature in 1968 and later formed the basis of Alberta&#x27;s Human Resources Development Authority and related programs under Premier Harry Strom, Ernest Manning&#x27;s successor. Manning also contributed to the development of a &quot;socio-economic development model&quot; for TRW Systems of Redondo Beach, California, as the firm was endeavouring to shift its focus from the systems management of military projects to the management of &quot;civil systems&quot;.

Over the next twenty years Manning continued to work as a management consultant using his firms – M and M Systems Research Ltd. and Manning Consultants Ltd. – to pursue projects of political relevance. These included the development of strategies to prevent investor owned utilities from being nationalized by their provincial governments, developing a model of federal provincial negotiations which enabled his firm to predict the outcomes of federal provincial conferences, and assisting energy companies to increase their hiring of Indigenous workers and purchases from Indigenous-owned and operated companies. In an effort to stimulate economic growth in the depressed region of north central Alberta, Manning served for almost twenty years as the President and CEO of a duel objective – social and economic – enterprise named Slave Lake Developments Ltd (later renamed Spruceland Properties Ltd). When the company was finally sold in 2016 it distributed over $55 million in dividends to some 300 local shareholders – illustrating Manning&#x27;s belief that economic development could be more effectively stimulated in a depressed region by &quot;a better distribution of the Tools of Wealth Creation&quot; than by income redistribution schemes.

== Rise of the Reform Party of Canada (1987–1993) ==
In the mid-1980s, Manning and his associates were becoming increasingly aware of a growing political discontent in Western Canada and growing disillusionment with the traditional federal political parties. Interest in western separatism was growing as well. On October 16, 1986, Manning convened a small meeting in Calgary of 5 people – himself, Dr. David Elton (a pollster and President of the Canada West Foundation), James Gray (a prominent Progressive Conservative and Calgary business man), and two oil sector lawyers, Bob Muir and Doug Hilland – to discuss the West&#x27;s political options. The group could not agree on a specific course of action but decided there would be merit in holding a conference in the spring of 1987 to develop a Western Political Agenda and to sponsor a debate on various means of advancing it.

A conference organizing and promotional group was assembled which now included several prominent but disillusioned Liberals, Stan Roberts a former Liberal MLA from Manitoba and Francis Winspear, a prominent Edmonton businessman who offered to help finance the conference. Ted Byfield, the publisher and editor of &quot;The Western Report,&quot; also became heavily involved in shaping the Western Agenda and in promoting what was now named The Western Assembly on Canada&#x27;s Economic &amp; Political Future.

In May 1987, the Western Assembly was held in Vancouver. It adopted a short Western Political Agenda which included such proposals as balancing the federal budget, electing the Canadian Senate, entrenching economic rights, more vigorously pursuing free trade, and allowing more free votes in the House of Commons. The Assembly was also presented with three major options for advancing the Agenda – working through an existing federal party, forming a new western based interest or pressure group, or forming a new western based, federal political party – following in the footsteps of previous western based federal parties, the Progressive Party of Canada, the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) and the federal Social Credit party. Manning presented the case for the new party, the attendees voted 77 percent in favour of that option, and a resolution was passed to hold the Founding Convention for the new party in Winnipeg in the fall.

The proposed Founding Assembly was subsequently held in Winnipeg on October 30 to November 1, 1987. It resolved unanimously to create a new federal party based in the west, adopted a draft constitution and a platform embodying the Western Agenda, and chose to name itself, at Manning&#x27;s suggestion, the Reform Party of Canada. One highlight of the Assembly was an address by Stephen Harper on the application of a &quot;regional fairness criterion&quot; to national decision making. Knowing that any new party would need a Policy Chief, Manning had approached Harper, then a graduate student in economics at the University of Calgary, and invited him to make a major presentation at the Winnipeg Assembly. Harper became the Reform Party&#x27;s Policy Chief and would later become Prime Minister of Canada. The Founding Assembly concluded with the election of Diane Ablonczy, a Calgary lawyer, as Chair of the new party&#x27;s governing Council and Manning as Leader – after the only other candidate, Stan Roberts, dropped out of the leadership contest citing voting irregularities.

In the 1988 Canadian federal election, both Harper and Manning were Reform Party candidates – Manning running in the federal riding of Yellowhead against former Prime Minister Joe Clark. In total, Reform ran 72 candidates, all of whom were defeated, although 15, including Manning and Harper, finished in second place. In 1989, however, Reform scored its first electoral victory when a by-election was held on March 13 in the federal riding of Beaver River and the Reform candidate, Deborah Grey was elected. Stephen Harper joined Ms. Grey in Ottawa as her Policy Advisor and Executive Assistant, while Manning continued to travel the country building the party.

These building efforts were relatively successful in Ontario, and more-so in the West, but Manning&#x27;s efforts to plant the party in Quebec and points east were especially hampered by his inability to speak French and to present Reform as more than a regional party.

Between the 1988 and 1993 federal elections, two significant events helped to boost public awareness of Manning, the Reform Party, and the party&#x27;s organizational capabilities. The first was a province wide election in Alberta to choose a candidate to be recommended to the Governor General by the federal government for appointment to the Canadian Senate. Reform put forward Stan Waters, a prominent Calgary businessman, war hero, and former Lieutenant-General and Commander of the Canadian Armed Forces. He and Manning campaigned vigorously across the province and on election day, October 16, 1989, Waters received slightly more than 620,000 votes (41.7 percent of the total) – the largest electoral mandate ever received by a single candidate for a Canadian parliamentary office. On June 11, 1990, Waters was reluctantly recommended for appointment to the Senate by then Prime Minister Brian Mulroney where he (Waters) continued to campaign vigorously for Reform&#x27;s &quot;Triple-E Senate&quot; – Elected, Equal, and Effective.

=== 1993 federal election ===
In June 1993, Prime Minister Mulroney resigned, to be replaced by Kim Campbell, who then called a federal election for October 25, 1993. Manning and Reform campaigned on the theme of &quot;The West Wants In&quot;. and the Reform agenda adopted at previous party conventions. When the results were in, Reform had received 2,559,245 votes and elected 52 members to the House of Commons – with Manning winning in Calgary Southwest, Stephen Harper winning in Calgary West, and Deborah Grey being re-elected in Beaver River. The Progressive Conservative Party of Canada was reduced to two seats, the greatest electoral defeat ever suffered by a major federal political party in Canada. 51 of Reform&#x27;s seats were in the west and Manning emerged as the principal political voice of the West and fiscal conservatism in the House of Commons.

Despite finishing second in the popular vote, Reform came up three seats short of becoming the Official Opposition, largely because the concentration of support for the sovereigntist Bloc Québécois in Quebec was slightly stronger than the concentration of support for Reform in the West. However, the Liberal government under Jean Chrétien characterized Manning and Reform as their main opponent on non-Quebec matters. In 1995 when Bloc leader Lucien Bouchard&#x27;s position as Opposition Leader granted him a meeting with visiting US President Bill Clinton, Manning was also given a meeting with Clinton to diffuse Bouchard&#x27;s separatist leverage.

== Early parliamentary years (1993–1997) ==
The 1993 Liberal Red Book containing its election platform scarcely mentioned deficit and debt reduction, but Reform had gained over 2.5 million votes campaigning heavily on the need to balance the federal budget. Much of Manning&#x27;s and Reform&#x27;s energy in the 35th Parliament was therefore focused on pressuring the Chrétien government on this issue and in 1998 the federal budget was at last balanced for the first time in years.

Manning and Reform also continued to pressure the government on the issue of Senate reform, but the Liberals argued that this could only be accomplished by a constitutional amendment and that the country was weary of constitutional matters. On April 20, 1998, Manning gave the longest and most comprehensive speech on Senate reform given in the House of Commons in the 20th century. In it he described in graphic detail the major defects of the Senate and the inappropriate, patronage infected behaviour of many of its members. He then reviewed all the previous major attempt at Senate reform and the reasons for their failure, concluding with the case for Reform&#x27;s Triple E Senate. The government was unmoved, and Senate reform was not pursued in earnest again until the Harper government introduced Senate reform legislation embodying two-thirds of the Triple E Senate concept in 2007. When referred to the Supreme Court, however, the court ruled that the federal government could not unilaterally make the changes contained in the bill and once again Senate reform was stalled indefinitely.

During Reform&#x27;s first term, several of its members and spokespersons made offensive and politically incorrect remarks which enabled its opponents to label it as extreme and undisciplined. On some occasions Manning was obliged to apologize on behalf of the party; on other occasions he dismissed criticisms by saying &quot;A bright light sometimes attracts a few bugs.&quot; Manning allowed his members considerable liberty in voting in the House of Commons, especially on matters not central to the Reform platform. While &quot;freer voting for members of parliament&quot; was a plank in the Reform platform, its exercise in practice frequently led to headlines such as &quot;Reform Divided&quot; and damaged rather than enhanced Manning&#x27;s efforts to push democratic reforms.

=== 1997 federal election ===
On June 2, 1997, the next federal general election was held. Support for the Bloc declined in Quebec, the party winning 44 seats, down 10 from the previous election. This time Reform won 19.1 percent of the popular vote (2,513,070 votes) and 60 seats, including one in Ontario, compared with 18.8 percent of the popular vote for the Progressive Conservatives (2,446,705 votes) and 20 seats. The gains by Reform in seats were sufficient to make Reform the Official Opposition and hense Manning Leader of the Official Opposition in the 36th Parliament. But vote splitting between Reform and the Progressive Conservative Party continued to hand scores of federal seats, especially in Ontario, to the federal Liberals, who again formed a majority government, a very slim one this time.

== Opposition leader (1997–2000) ==
The 1997 federal election convinced Manning and others that the continued vote splitting between Reform and the Progressive Conservatives needed to be addressed if Canada was to ever get a conservative oriented federal government. At the May 1998 Reform Convention in London, Ontario, Manning therefore proposed an effort to create a United Alternative to the Liberals and a process for exploring the possibility of bringing Reform and the Progressive Conservatives together. A resolution endorsing the United Alternative proposal was then debated and passed by a vote of 91 percent in favour.

The subsequent United Alternative initiative was aided by the departure of Jean Charest from the leadership of the federal Progressive Conservatives to pursue provincial politics in Quebec and by the support of provincial Progressive Conservative premiers, in particular, Mike Harris of Ontario, Gary Filmon of Manitoba, and Ralph Klein in Alberta. The process for achieving it, under Manning&#x27;s leadership, was incremental, beginning with the creation of a United Alternative Steering Committee involving representatives of both parties and the convening of an initial United Alternative Conference. The Conference was held in February 1999, and attended by 1,500 delegates including both Reform and PC representatives.

On the urging of Manning and others, the Conference endorsed an action plan to create a new federal political party, its constitution, principles, and platform to be determined at a second United Alternative convention prior to June 30, 2000. In keeping with its grass roots consultative tradition, the executive of the Reform Party then scheduled a referendum among party members on the question, &quot;Should the Reform Party of Canada continue with the United Alternative process – Yes or No?&quot; Besides carrying on his duties as Official Opposition Leader, Manning then went on an extensive, cross country campaign to convince Reformers to vote Yes. On June 10, 1999, 60.5 percent of the participating Reform members voted Yes, to continuing the UA process – enough support for Manning to continue to press the UA option, but enough internal opposition to indicate that there were still many obstacles to be overcome.

In January 2000, the second United Alternative Conference was held, with Manning keeping a low profile so as not to convey the impression that the exercise was really just a Reform &quot;take over&quot; of the federal Progressive Conservatives. Major speeches in favour of creating the new party were therefore given by Stockwell Day, Alberta&#x27;s Progressive Conservative Finance Minister, and Tom Long, a well known lieutenant of Ontario&#x27;s Progressive Conservative Premier, Mike Harris. This convention, after vigorous debate, approved the constitutional framework and platform for a new party, to be named the Canadian Reform Conservative Alliance.

Immediately following the second UA Conference, the Reform Party held a one-day conference of its own. It reviewed the results of the UA conference and was required by its constitution to vote on whether it approved or disapproved of Manning&#x27;s continued leadership. Reform delegates were asked again if they wished to continue the UA process, and if they did so, to authorize a final referendum among Reform Party members as to whether or not to become part of the Canadian Alliance. Manning gave yet another major address in support of &quot;political realignment&quot;. It was entitled &quot;Think Big&quot; and was nationally televised, aimed as much at the Canadian electorate as at Reformers. The motion to hold a second referendum was subsequently carried. The vote endorsing Manning&#x27;s continued leadership of the Reform Party also carried by 73 percent in favour. While this support level for Manning&#x27;s leadership was substantial, it was also evident that he was slowly using up his personal political capital in pushing the realignment agenda.

Believing that the best way to convince Reformers to support the Canadian Alliance was to demonstrate that the Alliance and its platform were saleable to the Canadian people, Manning launched another 6-week cross country tour aimed at convincing general audiences, not just Reformers, of the merits of the concept. On March 25, 2000, a large crowd of Reformers assembled at the Palliser hotel in Calgary to receive the results of the second party referendum. 91.5 percent of the participating members from across the country voted in the affirmative – the Reform Party of Canada ceased to exist and the Canadian Reform Conservative Alliance officially came into being. Immediately following the vote, Manning advised the Speaker of the House of Commons that all Reform members of Parliament should now be recognized as members of the Canadian Alliance and that Deborah Grey would serve as leader of the official opposition (and interim leader of the Canadian Alliance) until a leader of the Canadian Alliance was chosen.

=== Leadership election ===
Exhausted by three years of constant campaigning to create the &quot;united alternative&quot;, Manning and his supporters now prepared to engage in yet another campaign – for the leadership of the newly created Canadian Alliance. It was to be decided by a vote of the Alliance membership using a preferential ballot and to be completed by July 8, 2000. The slogan adopted by the Manning Team for this campaign was &quot;PM4PM&quot;. Manning had resigned his position as Leader of the Opposition to combat the charge that it gave him an unfair advantage over other contestants for the Alliance leadership. Because it was important that the Alliance leadership be contested by prominent Progressive Conservatives, not just by Reformers, Manning welcomed the entry of Stockwell Day, the Alberta cabinet minister, into the contest. Because it was equally important that the leadership contest involve a prominent Progressive Conservative from Ontario, so that the Alliance did not appear to be totally western dominated, both Manning and Day also welcomed Tom Long&#x27;s entry.

The Canadian Alliance leadership contest itself lasted 3 months in which the contenders crisscrossed the country numerous times and grew the membership of the Canadian Alliance to over 200,000 members, when the results of the first ballot were announced on June 24, 2000, Stockwell Day had received 44 percent of the vote (53,249 votes out of 120,557), with Manning receiving 36 percent and Long 18 percent. When the results of the second ballot were counted on July 8, 2000, the vote was 64 percent for Day and 36 percent for Manning. Stockwell Day became the leader of the Canadian Alliance and Leader of the Official Opposition in parliament. Manning&#x27;s role as a political party and opposition leader was over. As he ruefully remarked, &quot;The operation was a success but the doctor died.&quot;

== Conservative Party of Canada ==
In the fall of 2000, the Liberals called an early election vigorously contested by the Canadian Alliance and its new Leader. But although Day, Manning, and other key Reformers were re-elected the Alliance won only 66 seats. Manning served briefly in the 37th parliament as his party&#x27;s critic for Science and Technology. But it was felt that his presence as a former leader hampered Day&#x27;s leadership efforts and he resigned his seat in January 2002.

After considerable internal dissension, Day resigned as Canadian Alliance leader to be replaced by Stephen Harper who had re-entered federal politics after remaining aloof during the party&#x27;s formation. Negotiations were then undertaken between Harper and Peter MacKay, who had assumed the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada. In the fall of 2003 an agreement in principle was reached to merge the two parties to create the Conservative Party of Canada (CPC). In March 2004, the leadership of the CPC was won by Stephen Harper.

Manning took no formal part in the creation of the CPC, devoting himself to building &quot;the conservative movement&quot; as distinct from its partisan manifestations. Nor did he play a prominent role in the next three federal elections, although he continued to support the CPC in principle and provide advice and support to individual candidates.

The CPC – building on foundations laid by Reform, the Alliance, and the Progressive Conservative Party – continued to make electoral progress. In the January 2006 federal election it won 124 seats compared to 103 for the Liberals and formed its first minority government with Harper as Prime Minister. Seeking a majority, Harper asked the Governor General to dissolve the House in September 2008. In the subsequent October election, the CPC won 143 seats – still 12 seats short of a majority. Early in 2011, the Harper government was defeated by a non-confidence vote, thus forcing a general election. This time, in the May 2011 election, the CPC won 166 seats, sufficient to form a majority government. In that election, the Liberals won the fewest federal seats in their history, and were reduced to third party status, while the NDP made unprecedented gains to become the Official Opposition.

== After politics ==
Most commentary on Manning and his Reform Party ignores his political thinking and portrays him in terms of traditional western-based political protest movements. Sigurdson (1994) argues that Manning should be regarded instead as a postmodern conservative whose politics are a response to the process of postmodernization that has characterized Canada in recent years.

Manning himself has said that the greatest contribution of Reform to national politics was to demonstrate that, despite all the flaws and shortcomings of Canadians democracy, a small group of people with limited resources could still take the tools that democracy gives to all Canadians – freedom of speech, freedom of association, and freedom to persuade electors to vote this way or that – and change, at least to some degree, the composition and direction of the parliament and the policies of the national government.

Upon his retirement from parliament, Manning and his associates established two, not-for-profit, organizations – the Manning Foundation for Democratic Education and the Manning Centre for Building Democracy – with Manning serving as the President and CEO of both. The purpose of both organizations is to strengthen democracy in Canada, in accordance with conservative values and principles.

The principal themes on which Manning has written, lectured, and consulted on since leaving parliament and partisan responsibilities have included:

* Securing greater freedom of choice for Canadians with respect to health, education, and social services – the three largest components of provincial government budgets.
* Strengthening relations between the scientific and political communities (Manning is a founding supporter and promoter of the annual Canadian Science Policy Conference)
* Equipping faith oriented Canadians to participate wisely and graciously in democratic politics.
* Understanding populism from the perspective of Western Canada&#x27;s extensive experience with that political phenomenon
* Beyond &quot;left-centre-right&quot; politics; redefining political space for next generation Canadians
* Harnessing market mechanisms (pricing systems, financial incentives, entrepreneurship) to environmental conservation as an alternative to massive macro and micro environmental regulation by governments
* Addressing poverty and economic inequalities by securing a broader distribution of the Tools of Wealth Creation, rather than relying solely on income redistribution through progressive taxation.
* Market capitalism vs. State Directed Capitalism: Citizen Directed Democracy vs. State Directed Democracy: Winning the Ideological Battle with Communist China.

=== Fair Deal panel ===
On November 9, 2019, Premier Jason Kenney announced that Manning would lead an Alberta panel focused on getting a &quot;fair deal&quot; in Confederation, along with expanding the autonomy of the Alberta government. The panel is considering measures such as withdrawing Alberta workers from the Canada Pension Plan, the establishment of a provincial tax collection agency, ending the use of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and creating an independent police force, and establishing a formal Alberta constitution. This announcement was made during a speech by Premier Kenney at the Manning Centre in Red Deer. The panel submitted its final report in May 2020.

=== Manning Centre ===
In 2005, Manning left the House of Commons and founded the Manning Centre for Building Democracy, a not-for-profit &quot;political think tank and advocacy group&quot; that promoted conservative principles. The Manning Centre had provided a networking opportunity for &quot;conservatives from different provincial parties&quot;, and their &quot;federal counterparts&quot; and a space to &quot;exchange ideas and propose policy initiatives&quot;, according to Chuck Strahl, who had served as a Reform MP and Conservative cabinet minister. Prior to the creation of the Manning Centre, there &quot;wasn&#x27;t a networking opportunity for what Preston always called the &#x27;conservative movement,&#x27; as opposed to political parties.&quot; Preston believed that &quot;the conservative movement benefit[ed] from getting together, in all of its facets, and without having the party hierarchy managing it or overlooking it. This was the best way to get the best conservative ideas.&quot;

For twelve years, the Manning Centre organized the annual Manning Networking Conference.

In July 2016, Manning resigned from his executive functions with the Foundation and Centre, although he continues to support and pursue its objectives in his role as Founder. Management of the Centre and Foundation is currently the responsibility of their Boards of Directors as they conduct the search for Manning&#x27;s successor.

In the run up to the 2019 Canadian federal election, the Manning Centre provided a &quot;total of $312,450 to a network of related third-party advertising groups&quot; operating on Facebook and Instagram. This included $240,000 to Canada Strong and Proud for a &quot;series of anti-Trudeau and anti-Liberal campaign ads.&quot; The centre also &quot;gave $4,500 to Newfoundland and Labrador Strong and another $11,200 to Nova Scotia Strong.

On January 16, 2020 Manning announced that he was retiring from the Centre, to spend more time with his family. Troy Lanigan, the president of the Manning Centre, said that the Centre and the &quot;high-profile conferences it organizes&quot;, were in the process of being renamed and &quot;rebranded&quot;. The newly branded entity will continue to break &quot;down silos and getting conservatives to work together and work strategically to create opportunities for success&quot;, as Manning had done.

== Honours and awards ==
Manning has served as a Fellow of the Canada West Foundation, the Fraser Institute, the Marketplace Institute of Regent College and as a Distinguished Visitor at the University of Toronto and the University of Calgary. He is the recipient of honorary degrees from the University of Toronto, York University, McMaster Divinity School, Tyndale University, the University of Alberta, the University of Calgary, the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology, the University of British Columbia, Trinity Western University, and Crandall University.

In 2007, Manning was appointed a Companion of the Order of Canada. In that year, he was also appointed to the Council of Canadian Academies.

In 2007, Manning hosted a Canadian adaptation of the radio series &quot;This I Believe&quot; on CBC Radio One.

When Manning was Leader of the Opposition, he was featured in a skit on the Canadian TV show, Royal Canadian Air Farce on December 31, 1997. This skit was one of three contenders for the Viewer&#x27;s Choice &quot;Flashback&quot; for the episode airing on December 5, 2008.

In 2012, Manning was appointed to the Alberta Order of Excellence.

In 2013, Manning was appointed to the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada.

=== Order of Canada Citation ===
Manning was appointed a Companion of the Order of Canada in 2007 for devoting &quot;his life to public service.&quot; He was honoured as the founding father of the Reform Party and as leader of the Official Opposition. He was acknowledged for his steadfastness in giving &quot;voice to the concerns of many Canadians&quot; and for &quot;tirelessly [championing] the cause of democratic and political reform.&quot; Following his retirement from politics, He founded Manning Centre for Building Democracy in 2005. He also &quot;continued his contribution to public policy dialogue through his involvement with numerous research and consulting organizations&quot;, such as the Fraser Institute, and the Canada West Foundation.

<doc id="233385" wikidata="Q1533797" url="?curid=233385" title="ISWIM">
<text>ISWIM (If You See What I Mean) is an abstract computer programming language (or a family of languages) devised by Peter Landin and first described in his article &quot;The Next 700 Programming Languages&quot;, published in the &quot;Communications of the ACM&quot; in 1966.

Although not implemented, it has proved very influential in the development of programming languages, especially functional programming languages such as SASL, Miranda, ML, Haskell and their successors, and dataflow programming languages like Lucid.

== Design ==
ISWIM is an imperative programming language with a functional core, consisting of a syntactic sugaring of lambda calculus to which are added mutable variables and assignment and a powerful control mechanism: the &quot;program point&quot; operator. Being based on lambda calculus, ISWIM has higher-order functions and lexically scoped variables.

The operational semantics of ISWIM are defined using Landin&#x27;s SECD machine and use call-by-value, that is eager evaluation. A goal of ISWIM was to look more like mathematical notation, so Landin abandoned ALGOL&#x27;s semicolons between statements and codice_1 ... codice_2 blocks and replaced them with the off-side rule and scoping based on indentation.

A notationally distinctive feature of ISWIM is its use of &quot;codice_3&quot; clauses. An ISWIM program is a single expression qualified by &quot;where&quot; clauses (auxiliary definitions including equations among variables), conditional expressions and function definitions. Along with CPL, ISWIM was one of the first programming languages to use &quot;where&quot; clauses.

A notable semantic feature was the ability to define new data types, as a (possibly recursive) sum of products. This was done using a somewhat verbose natural language style description, but apart from notation amounts exactly to the algebraic data types found in modern functional languages. ISWIM variables did not have explicit type declarations and it seems likely (although not explicitly stated in the 1966 paper) that Landin intended the language to be dynamically typed, like LISP and unlike ALGOL; but it is also possible that he intended to develop some form of type inference.

== Implementations and derivatives ==
No direct implementation of ISWIM was completed but Art Evan&#x27;s language &quot;PAL&quot;, and John C. Reynolds&#x27; language &quot;Gedanken&quot;, captured most of Landin&#x27;s concepts, including powerful transfer-of-control operations. Both of these were typed dynamically. Robin Milner&#x27;s ML may be considered equivalent to I without the J operator and with type inference.

Another line of descent from ISWIM is to strip out the imperative features (assignment and the J operator) leaving a purely functional language. It then becomes possible to switch to lazy evaluation. This path led to programming languages SASL, Kent Recursive Calculator (KRC), Hope, Miranda, Haskell, and Clean.

<doc id="233389" wikidata="Q1418152" url="?curid=233389" title="Moebius syndrome">
<text>Möbius syndrome or Moebius syndrome is a rare congenital neurological disorder which is characterized by facial paralysis and the inability to move the eyes from side to side. Most people with Möbius syndrome are born with complete facial paralysis and cannot close their eyes or form facial expressions. Limb and chest wall abnormalities sometimes occur with the syndrome. People with Möbius syndrome have normal intelligence, although their lack of facial expression is sometimes incorrectly taken to be due to dullness or unfriendliness. It is named for Paul Julius Möbius, a German neurologist who first described the syndrome in 1888. In 1994, the &quot;Moebius Syndrome Foundation&quot; was founded, and later that year the first &quot;Moebius Syndrome Foundation Conference&quot; was held in Los Angeles.

==Signs and symptoms==

People with Möbius syndrome are born with facial paralysis and the inability to move their eyes laterally. Often, their upper lip is retracted due to muscle shrinkage. Occasionally, cranial nerves V and VIII are affected.

Other symptoms that sometimes occur with Möbius syndrome are:
* Limb abnormalities—clubbed feet, missing fingers or toes
* Chest-wall abnormalities (Poland syndrome)
* Crossed eyes (strabismus)
* Difficulty in breathing and/or in swallowing
* Corneal erosion resulting from difficulty in blinking

Children with Möbius syndrome may have delayed speech because of paralysis of muscles that move the lips, soft palate and tongue root. However, with speech therapy, most people with Möbius syndrome can develop understandable speech. Möbius syndrome has been associated with increased occurrence of the symptoms of autism.

===Social and lifestyle effects===
Möbius syndrome does not prevent individuals from experiencing personal and professional success. Due to the importance of facial expression and smiling in social interaction, the inability to form either can lead to individuals with Möbius being perceived as unhappy, unfriendly or uninterested in conversations. Individuals who are familiar with Möbius patients such as family or friends can recognize other signals of emotion such as body language, to the point that they sometimes report forgetting that the person has facial paralysis. People with Möbius syndrome are often adept at compensating for a lack of expression by using body language, posture, and vocal tone to convey emotion.

==Pathogenesis==
Möbius syndrome results from the underdevelopment of the VI and VII cranial nerves.

The causes of Möbius syndrome are poorly understood. It is thought to result from a vascular disruption (temporary loss of blood flow) in the brain during prenatal development. There can be many reasons for vascular disruption leading to Möbius syndrome. Most cases do not appear to be genetic. However, genetic links have been found in a few families. Some maternal trauma may result in impaired or interrupted blood flow (ischemia) or lack of oxygen (hypoxia) to a developing fetus. Some cases are associated with reciprocal translocation between chromosomes or maternal illness.

The use of drugs and a traumatic pregnancy may also be linked to the development of Möbius syndrome. The use of the drugs misoprostol or thalidomide by women during pregnancy has been linked to the development of Möbius syndrome in some cases. Misoprostol is used to induce abortions in Brazil and Argentina as well as in the United States. Misoprostol abortions are successful 98-99% of the time, with failed procedures generally repeated or managed surgically meaning that continued pregnancies are incredibly rare after use of misoprostol. Studies show that the use of misoprostol during pregnancy increases the risk of developing Möbius syndrome by a factor of 30. While this is a dramatic increase in risk, the incidence of Möbius syndrome without misoprostol use is estimated at one in 50,000 to 100,000 births (making the incidence of Möbius syndrome with misoprostol use, less than one in 1,000 births). The use of cocaine (which also has vascular effects) has been implicated in Möbius syndrome.

===Oral/dental concerns===
====Neonatal====
When a child is born with Möbius syndrome, there may be difficulty in closing the mouth or swallowing. The tongue may fasciculate (quiver) or be hypotonic (low muscle tone). The tongue may be larger or smaller than average. There may be low tone of the muscles of the soft palate, pharynx, and the masticatory system. The palate may be arched excessively (a high palate), because the tongue does not form a suction that would normally shape the palate down further. The palate may have a groove (this may be partially due to intubation early on if it is for an extended period of time) or may be cleft (incompletely formed).

====Primary dentition====
The primary (baby) teeth generally start coming in by 6 months of age, and all 20 teeth may be in by two and a half years of age. The eruption timing varies greatly. There may be an incomplete formation of the enamel on the teeth (enamel hypoplasia) that makes the teeth more vulnerable to caries (cavities). There may be missing teeth eruptions. If the infant is not closing down properly, the lower jaws become more noticeably deficient (micrognathia or retrognathia). The front teeth may not touch when the child closes down because the back teeth have overerrupted or because of incomplete formation of the maxilla. This condition is called an anterior open bite and has facial/skeletal implications.

====Transitional dentition====
Between age 5 and 7, most children start losing their primary teeth. Occasionally, some primary teeth are slow to exfoliate (fall out), and the dentist may want to remove a primary tooth early to prevent orthodontic problems. Likewise, premature loss of primary teeth may create orthodontic problems later on. When a tooth is lost prematurely, removable or fixed spacers may be needed to prevent the shifting of teeth. Interceptive orthodontic treatment can be initiated at this stage of development to help with crowding or to help relate the upper and lower jaws. Consistent with a high palate is a narrow arch shape of the upper teeth as they line up in the mouth. This may cause the upper front teeth to flare out and become more prone to fracture if accidentally hit. Interceptive orthodontics has an important role in this situation. Appliances that expand the upper arch tend to bring the front teeth back into a more-normal position. Some appliances can even help allow the front teeth to close to normal in an open-bite situation. The mouth and lips may tend to get dry with the Möbius patient.

====Permanent dentition====
After the last primary tooth is lost, usually around the age of twelve, final orthodontic treatment can be initiated. A patient that has not been able to close or swallow well probably will have an open bite, deficient lower-jaw growth, a narrow archform with crowded teeth, and upper anterior flaring of teeth. Orthognathic (jaw) surgery may be indicated.

Genetic links to 13q12.2 and 1p22 have been suggested.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is typically made by the physical characteristics and symptoms, patient history and a thorough clinical evaluation. There is no specific diagnostic test that confirms Möbius syndrome. Some specialised tests may be carried out to rule out other causes of facial palsy.

==Treatment==

There is no single course of medical treatment or cure for Möbius syndrome. Treatment is supportive and in accordance with symptoms. If they have difficulty nursing, infants may require feeding tubes or special bottles to maintain sufficient nutrition. Physical, occupational, and speech therapy can improve motor skills and coordination and can lead to better control of speaking and eating abilities. Often, frequent lubrication with eye drops is sufficient to combat dry eye that results from impaired blinking. Surgery can correct crossed eyes, protect the cornea via tarsorraphy, and improve limb and jaw deformities. Sometimes called smile surgery by the media, muscle transfers grafted from the thigh to the corners of the mouth can be performed to provide the ability to smile. Although &quot;smile surgery&quot; may provide the ability to smile, the procedure is complex and can take twelve hours for each side of the face. Also, the surgery cannot be considered a &quot;cure&quot; for Möbius syndrome, because it does not improve the ability to form other facial expressions.

==Epidemiology==
It is estimated that there are, on average, 2 to 20 cases of Möbius syndrome per million births. Although its rarity often leads to late diagnosis, infants with this disorder can be identified at birth by a &quot;mask-like&quot; lack of expression that is detectable during crying or laughing and by an inability to suck while nursing because of paresis (palsy) of the sixth and seventh cranial nerves.

==Society and culture ==
Literature and media with mentions of Möbius syndrome include:
* The protagonist of the novel &quot;Painted&quot; by Eliza Wyatt and Christian Leffler has Möbius syndrome.
* In the second season of &quot;Scream Queens&quot;, Daira Janessen (Riley McKenna Weinstein), also known as Chanel 8, has Möbius syndrome.
* In “The Adventure of the Man Who Never Laughed”, a story written by John H. Watson, M.D./discovered by J. N. Williamson, and collected in &quot;Holmes For The Holidays&quot;, edited by Martin H. Greenberg, Jon L. Lellenberg and Carol-Lynn Waugh (Berkley Prime Crime, 1996), a missing person has Möbius syndrome.
* In The Good Doctor (season 1, episode 17, &quot;Smile&quot; released March 19, 2018) patient Gretchen seeks elective surgery for Möbius syndrome.
* In Grey&#x27;s Anatomy (season 16, episode 21, &quot;Put on a Happy Face&quot;) a young girl with Möbius syndrome wishes to undergo elective treatment for her condition.

<text>Elisabeth Domitien (1925 – 26 April 2005) served as the prime minister of the Central African Republic from 1975 to 1976. She was the first and only woman to hold the position, and was the first woman to serve as prime minister of a country in Africa.

== Family background ==

Domitien was born in Lobaye, Ubangi-Shari. The family had a plantation, and her father was employed in the postal service while her mother was a farmer.

== Early life and career ==
Domitien was the eldest child and the only daughter. She received only rudimentary instruction in reading and writing in a Catholic school and learned cooking and sewing. She spent much of her time working in the field and helped to sell farm products. However, she learned to deal with numbers and established herself as a farmer and business woman. She had a strong personality and was enterprising, making her popular among the village women and an informal leader in the community. At the age of 20 she became involved in the liberation struggle.

== Political life ==

Domitien mobilized the population with her speeches in Sangho, helped unite different groups and created a sense of national identity. She became head of the women&#x27;s group in the independence movement, the Movement for the Social Evolution of Black Africa (MESAN). She collaborated closely with Barthélémy Boganda, the founder of the movement, and became president of the party in 1953. The country became independent in 1960 and Domitien collaborated with the first president of the Central African Republic, David Dacko, and the commander-in-chief, Jean-Bédel Bokassa. She served as a political adviser both to the leaders and to ordinary people, trying to reconcile different interests and improve the living standards of the population. Dacko ruled in an authoritarian way and the country soon became a one-party state with MESAN as the sole legal party. In 1965 Bokassa seized power in a coup, abolished the constitution, dissolved parliament and appointed himself as the head of the party, state and government with legislative and executive power.

In 1972 Bokassa declared himself president for life and made Domitien vice president of the party. In 1973 she led the first national congress of Central African farmers. She was clever and industrious, appealed to the population and served as a unifying force which Bokassa needed. In 1974 he declared himself as marshal. He had a cabinet in which the ministers changed constantly and on 2 January 1975 he formed a new government. Here Bokassa introduced the post of prime minister and Elisabeth Domitien was appointed to the position. It was the International Women&#x27;s Year and Bokassa wanted to draw positive notice to himself internationally by appointing a woman in a leading position. She was the first woman to serve as prime minister of an African nation.

Domitien worked to strengthen the income and position of women. She was criticized by some people in CAR for the support she gave Bokassa. In her view the population should follow their leader. At the same time, she demanded that the president should respect the people and safeguard their interests. She was not afraid to voice her opinion, even to the president, and got many people out of jail after they were arrested without trial. Her relationship with Bokassa soured when he wanted to proclaim himself emperor. When Domitien opposed the plan, she was promptly fired and her cabinet was dismissed (7 April 1976).

With the overthrow of Bokassa in September 1979, Domitien was arrested and brought to trial on charges of covering up extortion committed by Bokassa during her tenure as prime minister. She served a brief prison term and was put on trial in 1980, after which she was prohibited from returning to politics. In 1981, the military gained control again and ruled for 12 years. In 1993, it was replaced by a civilian government and Ange-Félix Patassé was elected president. Domitien received compensation for the unjust treatment she had been exposed to. She remained a prominent figure, both as a former politician and as a businesswoman, and was buried with official honours when she died in 2005.

== Personal life ==

Domitien married twice; her first husband was Jean Baka who was an accountant in a river company and commuted back and forth between Bangui and Brazzaville. They had a daughter, Beatrice in 1941, but were eventually divorced. Later, Domitien married Mr Ngouka-Langadiji who was mayor and ran a coffee plantation in the Mobaye region east of the capital. He had several wives and did not move when he married Elisabeth. She lived alone in Bangui, and her husband came to visit her.
